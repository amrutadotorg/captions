1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,624
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:15,964
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:20,344
We can say this is the worship

4
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:24,434
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:34,364
If you understand that all this,

6
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:41,394
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:48,844
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:52,974
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:58,184
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:06,734
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:14,044
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:22,234
So, first of all, He did was to create

13
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:26,004
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:32,544
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:36,604
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:39,024
by the primordial sound,

17
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,284
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:49,004
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:53,824
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:01:54,024 --> 00:02:01,304
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:09,004
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:15,764
and for His own expression,

23
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:19,284
for His own manifestation,

24
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:23,604
for His own reflection.

25
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:29,504
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:34,604
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:40,274
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:50,284
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:56,794
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:02:56,994 --> 00:03:02,274
His desire to create.

31
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:07,014
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

32
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:11,654
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:15,684
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

34
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:21,874
The attention has its own joy

35
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:26,684
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:30,044
She created all the universes,

37
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:34,954
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:40,644
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,404
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:50,994
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:55,124
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:03:55,334 --> 00:04:00,494
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:03,904
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:10,814
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:17,294
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:20,304
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:24,464
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:28,394
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:34,034
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:35,884
to see His character

51
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:41,854
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:48,454
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:54,284
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:04:54,524 --> 00:05:00,714
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:06,614
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:11,674
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:17,734
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:22,474
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:28,294
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:35,484
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:41,424
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:46,264
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:50,664
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:54,804
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:57,384
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:05:57,584 --> 00:06:03,014
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:07,974
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:11,164
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:13,684
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:17,404
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:23,494
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:29,714
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:39,544
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:43,594
we do something, we can create.

75
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:50,094
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,674
leave alone anything else.

77
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:57,944
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:03,644
we can put together and create something,

79
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:13,224
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:18,304
any power.

81
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,544
We cannot create anything.

82
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:29,514
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:35,124
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:38,454
Still it is gold.

85
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,794
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:46,394
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:50,164
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:55,084
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:58,164
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:04,904
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:08,724
basically you all are the same.

92
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:14,364
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:18,774
also, you cry the same way.

94
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:22,644
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:27,504
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:33,634
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:38,494
by some common principle of life.

98
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:44,104
And the common principle of life that has bound us

99
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:51,154
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:54,064
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:56,514
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:08:56,714 --> 00:09:00,854
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:10,134
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:13,614
But in the human form only

105
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:20,754
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:26,344
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:31,844
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:37,994
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:41,554
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:49,054
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:54,234
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:09:54,444 --> 00:10:01,364
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:04,514
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:09,524
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,694
who have got your realization.

116
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:17,114
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:24,254
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:28,034
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,924
and the enjoyment.

120
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:39,864
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:43,624
what should happen to you?

122
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:48,274
What should we feel?

123
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:54,564
How do we then exist?

124
00:10:55,284 --> 00:11:00,574
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:04,434
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,064
that you are not there,

127
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:10,194
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:12,364
Secondly, what happens to you

129
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:17,284
is that you become just the existence.

130
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:20,244
Just the existence.

131
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,994
And that existence that you become,

132
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:28,554
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:34,174
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,214
also much before.

135
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:38,924
In every religion we have had people

136
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:43,594
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:11:43,794 --> 00:11:48,944
For example, even you can say,

138
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:56,114
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:11:56,314 --> 00:12:03,184
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:05,854
and a khumba also,

141
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,934
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:15,734
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:20,544
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:25,684
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:31,254
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:36,894
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:39,724
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:45,130
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:52,004
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:57,014
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:12:57,214 --> 00:13:01,504
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:06,884
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:14,154
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:17,464
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:23,774
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:29,064
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:34,504
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:37,624
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

159
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:42,354
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,924
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:49,504
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,114
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,274
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:13:54,474 --> 00:13:58,664
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:02,904
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:05,014
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

167
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:07,104
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,674
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:12,244
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:17,494
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:23,404
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:27,434
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:31,544
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:34,214
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,324
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:40,694
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:47,024
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:53,044
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:55,794
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:14:55,994 --> 00:15:00,294
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:02,594
and we have to respect it.

182
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,884
I've already told you many a times

183
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:07,974
about how human beings were formed

184
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:15,124
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:18,384
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,824
All this leads us to understand

187
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:26,674
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:33,224
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:36,134
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:40,274
where you have become yourself.

191
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,624
You know yourself.

192
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:46,874
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:54,384
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:15:56,754 --> 00:16:03,504
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:38,384
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:45,704
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:55,584
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:16:57,024 --> 00:17:02,074
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:06,004
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:09,704
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:17,684
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:27,474
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:32,404
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:38,534
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:43,074
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:47,784
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:51,904
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:56,724
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:17:56,924 --> 00:18:01,684
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:05,774
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:18:05,974 --> 00:18:09,634
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:14,124
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:19,794
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:23,174
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:31,114
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:34,564
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:43,114
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:50,874
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:56,834
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

220
00:18:57,034 --> 00:19:01,004
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

221
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:04,174
It is the One which has given you

222
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:07,354
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

223
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:11,904
"Whatever we have is given by You".

224
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:16,614
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:21,264
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:25,164
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:30,124
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:37,994
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:46,964
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:51,574
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:58,304
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:19:58,504 --> 00:20:02,364
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:08,234
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:11,874
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:14,924
It's such a relationship.

236
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:18,254
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:23,714
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:30,814
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:42,244
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:47,664
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:53,204
and over your development.

242
00:20:53,704 --> 00:21:01,254
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:05,874
Now

244
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:16,604
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:19,534
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:21,134
you may.

247
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,274
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:26,574
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:30,044
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:36,474
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:40,604
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:44,394
because it has a reaction.

253
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:52,614
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:21:52,844 --> 00:22:08,714
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:14,614
into the water automatically,

256
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:22,554
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:22:23,154 --> 00:22:27,594
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:30,984
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:36,274
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:46,644
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:53,244
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:22:53,444 --> 00:23:00,424
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:06,404
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:10,444
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:15,164
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:21,664
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,774
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:30,424
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,864
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:37,584
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:40,524
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:23:40,724 --> 00:23:44,714
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:47,814
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:54,684
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:23:55,084 --> 00:24:00,244
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:02,684
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:07,664
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:12,044
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:18,004
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:22,804
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,564
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:32,324
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:24:32,524 --> 00:24:37,484
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:40,024
how to make others feel it.

285
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:43,714
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:45,964
or something nonsensical.

287
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:49,944
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:56,064
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:24:56,264 --> 00:25:02,104
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:06,384
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:08,934
You're sure about this Power

292
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:13,314
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:16,454
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:25:16,664 --> 00:25:22,834
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:28,644
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:38,174
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:41,614
She tells you the truth.

298
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:48,654
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:53,494
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:57,454
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:25:57,664 --> 00:26:02,884
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:05,434
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:08,354
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:26:08,554 --> 00:26:11,224
that you forgive that person,

305
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:16,014
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:19,034
you don't do anything.

307
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:20,714
That's the truth.

308
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:25,464
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,124
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:33,004
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:36,344
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:41,184
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:46,094
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:49,464
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,604
It makes no difference.

316
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:55,664
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,904
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:04,334
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:09,154
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:12,754
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:16,364
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:27:16,574 --> 00:27:21,394
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:24,294
So, it's a play going on.

324
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:30,754
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:27:30,964 --> 00:27:39,704
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:45,214
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,884
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:53,994
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:27:54,194 --> 00:28:01,724
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:28:02,004 --> 00:28:10,564
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:13,694
When you have the enlightened faith,

332
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:20,424
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:28:20,624 --> 00:28:26,464
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:31,784
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:37,664
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:41,444
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:49,534
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:53,074
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:56,844
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:28:57,044 --> 00:29:04,454
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:10,644
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:29:10,844 --> 00:29:13,704
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:29:13,904 --> 00:29:17,624
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:23,364
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:27,664
this work could not have been done.

346
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:32,924
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:45,024
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:49,094
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:29:49,294 --> 00:29:52,864
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:29:53,064 --> 00:30:01,054
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:05,574
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:13,404
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,634
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:21,164
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:24,684
all of them are just the same.

356
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:34,054
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:30:34,254 --> 00:30:38,134
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:41,784
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:46,874
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:52,924
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:57,694
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:30:57,894 --> 00:31:04,864
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:10,384
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:15,614
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:22,724
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:27,594
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:31,604
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

368
00:31:31,804 --> 00:31:34,414
James or what St. John has said,

369
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:37,464
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:39,214
It doesn't matter.

371
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:47,084
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:51,264
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:56,274
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:31:56,474 --> 00:32:01,694
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:05,894
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:08,874
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:13,134
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:17,294
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:19,474
should not disturb you much

380
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:24,224
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:28,274
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:32,814
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:38,864
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:43,054
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:46,624
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:49,854
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:53,774
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:57,844
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:02,284
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:04,224
That's human nature also.

391
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:08,064
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:11,794
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:15,574
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:20,234
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:22,374
It will all work out.

396
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:26,794
It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:34,164
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:33:34,364 --> 00:33:36,984
of this compassion?".

399
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:42,514
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:46,244
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:33:46,444 --> 00:33:49,474
This compassion within you,

402
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:53,254
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:56,734
completely destroyed,

404
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:00,734
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:05,194
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:09,724
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:18,094
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:21,004
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:25,994
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:30,824
As you see, I would say,

411
00:34:31,024 --> 00:34:36,324
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:38,874
the water rises.

413
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:45,144
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:49,124
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:53,734
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:56,284
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:34:56,484 --> 00:35:02,724
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:09,604
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:12,314
you all have got your Realization

420
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:16,914
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:20,514
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:35:20,714 --> 00:35:24,704
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

423
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:28,744
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:34,334
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:38,704
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,984
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,694
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:48,294
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:51,674
That's what we have to understand

430
00:35:51,904 --> 00:36:01,024
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:03,514
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:08,984
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:14,944
I should say,

434
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:20,804
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:24,054
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:29,304
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:35,464
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:40,534
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:44,044
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:53,384
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:56,614
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,134
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:05,984
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:12,494
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:15,174
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:19,944
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:26,434
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:31,734
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:36,854
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:41,044
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,174
I think, from Africa.

452
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:47,704
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:51,104
Also, we have so many other areas

454
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:54,534
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:37:54,734 --> 00:38:01,394
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:03,934
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,844
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:10,764
who are not even seeking.

459
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:16,104
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:21,534
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:26,404
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:30,644
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:35,484
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:40,934
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:47,144
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:52,314
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:38:52,524 --> 00:38:56,224
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:59,864
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:01,954
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:07,854
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,914
This you will not do.

472
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:18,144
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:24,574
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:31,014
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

475
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:35,284
Once we start spreading out like that,

476
00:39:35,484 --> 00:39:38,354
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:41,584
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:39:41,784 --> 00:39:48,414
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:52,244
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:54,344
who don't have greed.

481
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:57,484
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:39:57,684 --> 00:40:03,364
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:40:03,564 --> 00:40:06,874
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,674
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:14,304
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:16,934
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:19,364
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:25,434
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,784
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:32,704
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:39,524
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,454
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:45,044
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:47,644
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:51,454
you will try to have more of it

496
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:56,464
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:59,574
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:01,514
women should work it out

499
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:07,074
because women have more sense of compassion,

500
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:11,624
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:14,824
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:41:15,024 --> 00:41:17,914
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:41:18,114 --> 00:41:23,374
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:28,074
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:41:28,274 --> 00:41:30,034
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:33,914
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:37,114
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:41:37,314 --> 00:41:44,134
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:41:44,344 --> 00:41:46,294
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:49,894
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:53,534
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:58,354
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:04,694
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:09,034
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:13,534
And as you are all married also,

516
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:18,744
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:42:18,944 --> 00:42:25,674
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:42:25,874 --> 00:42:27,994
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:32,084
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:36,124
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:39,774
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,524
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:42:43,724 --> 00:42:46,754
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:54,634
And if something

525
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:57,134
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:42:57,334 --> 00:42:59,514
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:03,264
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:06,644
and the household and this and that".

529
00:43:06,844 --> 00:43:10,444
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:13,174
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:16,924
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:43:17,124 --> 00:43:20,974
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:25,394
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:43:25,594 --> 00:43:30,544
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:36,394
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:44,764
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:43:44,964 --> 00:43:48,904
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:51,944
You will never grudge.

539
00:43:52,144 --> 00:43:57,404
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:43:57,854 --> 00:44:01,644
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:44:01,844 --> 00:44:05,144
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:11,254
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:16,294
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:44:16,494 --> 00:44:20,864
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:44:21,064 --> 00:44:24,384
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:27,584
So, the compassion has to become active.

547
00:44:27,784 --> 00:44:30,844
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:44:31,054 --> 00:44:33,324
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:38,304
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:44:38,504 --> 00:44:43,274
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:44:43,474 --> 00:44:46,534
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

552
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,714
some of the women have been men

553
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:53,564
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:58,134
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:44:58,344 --> 00:45:04,064
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:45:04,264 --> 00:45:05,684
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:08,424
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:11,324
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

559
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,324
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:16,334
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:45:16,544 --> 00:45:20,844
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:45:21,044 --> 00:45:27,014
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,514
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:34,474
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:37,084
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:41,064
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:44,684
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:48,984
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:54,224
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:45:54,424 --> 00:45:58,494
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:03,594
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:07,094
how it has worked out.

573
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:11,344
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:46:11,544 --> 00:46:15,614
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:20,304
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:46:20,504 --> 00:46:25,834
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,804
I can't understand

578
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:31,844
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

579
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:38,724
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

580
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:42,724
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:46:42,924 --> 00:46:51,824
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:46:52,024 --> 00:47:01,014
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:47:02,704 --> 00:47:06,424
It is to realize

584
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:14,874
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:19,114
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:25,654
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:47:25,854 --> 00:47:29,124
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:47:29,324 --> 00:47:32,004
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:47:32,204 --> 00:47:35,884
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:39,884
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:47:40,084 --> 00:47:42,754
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:47:42,954 --> 00:47:47,494
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:47:47,694 --> 00:47:52,964
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

594
00:47:53,164 --> 00:47:59,064
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:01,634
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:07,084
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,924
For your own life, is very important

598
00:48:11,124 --> 00:48:15,304
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:48:15,504 --> 00:48:21,434
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:25,704
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:30,034
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:34,474
Just think of it.

603
00:48:34,674 --> 00:48:42,004
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

604
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:48,314
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:55,094
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:48:55,294 --> 00:49:00,084
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:05,074
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:08,324
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

609
00:49:08,524 --> 00:49:10,064
Impossible.

610
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:15,334
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

611
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:18,104
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:49:18,304 --> 00:49:21,514
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:28,234
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:32,254
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:49:32,454 --> 00:49:38,794
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:49:38,994 --> 00:49:40,514
You can do it.

617
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:45,974
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:51,364
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:49:51,564 --> 00:49:55,994
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:59,234
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:06,254
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

622
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:12,034
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

623
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:15,284
As it is growing in quantity,

624
00:50:15,484 --> 00:50:19,194
it should also grow in quality.

625
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:24,254
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,564
Because I know all the time

627
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,614
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

628
00:50:29,814 --> 00:50:33,094
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:37,444
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:50:37,644 --> 00:50:39,654
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:50:39,854 --> 00:50:43,284
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:50:43,484 --> 00:50:45,354
So forget about them.

633
00:50:45,564 --> 00:50:52,284
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:54,644
They are your real relations.

635
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,754
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:50:58,954 --> 00:51:02,654
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:05,894
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:10,294
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:14,234
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:17,144
You should find out where are they.

641
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:20,054
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:25,034
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:26,644
Whatever you want,

644
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:31,334
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:51:31,534 --> 00:51:36,894
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:40,114
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:45,854
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:53,214
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:59,984
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:03,934
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:52:04,134 --> 00:52:07,974
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:52:08,174 --> 00:52:12,164
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:52:12,374 --> 00:52:15,414
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:17,814
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:21,014
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

656
00:52:21,214 --> 00:52:22,704
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:26,204
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:32,474
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:35,634
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:40,564
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:52:40,764 --> 00:52:45,564
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:52:45,764 --> 00:52:48,244
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:52:48,444 --> 00:52:52,274
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:52:52,474 --> 00:52:53,724
So, you have to worship.

665
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:58,084
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:52:58,284 --> 00:53:01,654
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:05,354
May God bless you.
