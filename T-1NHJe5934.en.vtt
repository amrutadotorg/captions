Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja, Sydney, Australia, April 4, 1981

00:02.930 --> 00:07.162
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

00:07.363 --> 00:14.205
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

00:15.382 --> 00:18.093
This day has never been celebrated before

00:18.294 --> 00:20.849
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21.050 --> 00:25.255
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

00:25.456 --> 00:32.730
because this is the New Year’s Day

00:32.931 --> 00:35.733
of the Shalivahan calendar.

00:35.934 --> 00:40.226
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

00:40.427 --> 00:42.751
and they are called as Shalivahan

00:42.952 --> 00:45.581
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

00:45.782 --> 00:48.707
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

00:48.921 --> 00:52.680
so many times My shawls around.

00:53.182 --> 00:55.186
And they were called as Shalivahan.

00:55.387 --> 01:04.102
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

01:04.303 --> 01:07.307
the nine days there are.

01:07.740 --> 01:15.797
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

01:15.998 --> 01:21.113
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

01:21.314 --> 01:25.775
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

01:25.961 --> 01:30.129
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

01:30.869 --> 01:37.058
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

01:37.259 --> 01:41.579
when She incarnated on this Earth.

01:42.238 --> 01:45.831
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

01:46.032 --> 01:50.852
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

01:51.984 --> 02:05.506
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

02:05.707 --> 02:08.902
just starting this week.

02:09.472 --> 02:11.706
What is the day? The day today is …?

02:11.907 --> 02:13.161
[Today’s the fourth.]

02:13.362 --> 02:14.362
Today ….

02:14.563 --> 02:17.004
[Saturday, Mother.]

02:17.775 --> 02:19.723
[Saturday.]

02:19.924 --> 02:23.952
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

02:24.153 --> 02:26.358
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

02:26.559 --> 02:29.270
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

02:29.471 --> 02:32.238
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

02:32.439 --> 02:33.573
and when you take My photograph

02:33.774 --> 02:36.437
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

02:36.638 --> 02:38.803
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

02:39.004 --> 02:42.479
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

02:42.680 --> 02:44.792
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

02:44.993 --> 02:47.228
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

02:47.429 --> 02:50.439
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.796
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

02:54.191 --> 02:57.097
[Hindi]

03:05.678 --> 03:11.562
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

03:11.763 --> 03:18.237
and then the Goddess started working.

03:18.438 --> 03:24.375
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

03:24.576 --> 03:27.220
She started working out on Wednesday.

03:27.421 --> 03:30.299
Wednesday is the action day,

03:30.500 --> 03:33.090
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

03:33.291 --> 03:37.467
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

03:37.668 --> 03:42.035
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

03:44.460 --> 03:48.847
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

03:49.048 --> 03:53.571
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

03:53.880 --> 03:58.176
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

03:58.377 --> 04:00.969
Wednesday is the second day.

04:01.170 --> 04:05.902
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

04:06.103 --> 04:10.554
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

04:10.755 --> 04:15.372
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

04:15.573 --> 04:22.638
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

04:23.341 --> 04:33.650
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

04:33.851 --> 04:37.140
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

04:37.341 --> 04:40.856
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

04:43.169 --> 04:46.258
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

04:46.459 --> 04:49.797
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

04:49.998 --> 04:53.086
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

04:53.287 --> 04:55.529
Venus.

04:56.991 --> 05:01.094
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

05:01.295 --> 05:06.560
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

05:08.111 --> 05:14.696
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

05:18.658 --> 05:23.189
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

05:24.991 --> 05:29.846
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

05:30.047 --> 05:33.648
is of realization, of integration.

05:34.282 --> 05:39.016
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

05:41.995 --> 05:44.451
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

05:44.652 --> 05:46.858
you cannot understand Christianity.

05:47.059 --> 05:50.871
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

05:51.072 --> 05:53.911
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

05:54.112 --> 05:58.307
then only you will understand what Christ said.

05:58.742 --> 06:03.588
So today is the day of – first day –

06:03.789 --> 06:06.247
of when Ganesha was created,

06:06.448 --> 06:13.583
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

06:13.784 --> 06:19.386
but according to dates of the moon,

06:19.587 --> 06:27.208
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

06:27.770 --> 06:28.944
[Marathi]

06:29.145 --> 06:33.019
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.953
And this is the time when –

06:35.154 --> 06:38.634
[Marathi]

06:44.047 --> 06:45.639
Gauri is the Chaitra.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.057
So the establishment of the Gauri

06:48.258 --> 06:50.945
is taken place during these nine days.

06:51.146 --> 06:55.080
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.609
Though first Gauri had to come,

06:57.810 --> 07:03.208
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

07:03.409 --> 07:07.450
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

07:07.651 --> 07:13.999
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

07:14.200 --> 07:15.986
nothing starts;

07:16.187 --> 07:19.352
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

07:19.553 --> 07:22.322
all the negativities,

07:22.523 --> 07:25.032
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

07:25.233 --> 07:29.975
all the attentions that are here and there.

07:30.176 --> 07:32.711
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

07:32.912 --> 07:35.667
just to ask Him to protect us.

07:35.868 --> 07:37.630
But first the Gauri has to come,

07:37.831 --> 07:42.677
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

07:42.878 --> 07:49.810
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

07:50.011 --> 07:57.880
negativity, for people to transcend

07:58.081 --> 08:02.678
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

08:02.879 --> 08:06.448
the maya, the illusion.

08:06.649 --> 08:10.897
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

08:11.098 --> 08:13.782
people used to obstruct

08:13.983 --> 08:19.130
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

08:19.331 --> 08:25.672
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

08:25.873 --> 08:28.558
and the saints were separate;

08:28.759 --> 08:31.556
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

08:31.757 --> 08:35.037
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

08:35.238 --> 08:38.420
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

08:38.621 --> 08:41.459
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

08:41.660 --> 08:44.053
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

08:44.254 --> 08:47.469
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

08:47.670 --> 08:50.315
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

08:50.516 --> 08:53.137
so we are not absolute saints.

08:53.338 --> 08:56.592
And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

08:56.793 --> 08:58.856
even when you are worshipping Me,

08:59.057 --> 09:03.227
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

09:03.428 --> 09:06.673
Try to be more on the saintly side.

09:06.874 --> 09:09.153
Because you are saints, no doubt,

09:09.354 --> 09:13.097
but these horrible things have somehow or other

09:13.298 --> 09:15.706
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

09:15.907 --> 09:19.616
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

09:19.817 --> 09:23.647
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

09:23.848 --> 09:29.100
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

09:29.301 --> 09:31.460
kalanka.

09:31.661 --> 09:34.880
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

09:35.081 --> 09:38.991
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

09:39.192 --> 09:41.766
be one with the puja.

09:41.967 --> 09:49.095
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

09:49.296 --> 09:55.609
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

09:56.757 --> 09:59.759
It was to be in Australia.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.753
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

10:03.954 --> 10:06.594
celebrated here.

10:13.383 --> 10:17.578
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

10:17.779 --> 10:20.096
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

10:20.297 --> 10:21.953
over nine days we have done.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.146
But never this Navaratri as such

10:24.347 --> 10:28.296
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

10:28.497 --> 10:32.306
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

10:32.507 --> 10:36.292
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

10:36.493 --> 10:41.850
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

10:42.051 --> 10:48.496
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

10:48.697 --> 10:55.659
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

11:02.887 --> 11:07.437
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

11:07.638 --> 11:14.786
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

11:14.991 --> 11:18.637
our heights,

11:18.838 --> 11:20.614
in our realization.

11:20.815 --> 11:23.781
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

11:23.982 --> 11:26.051
we are rising high;

11:26.252 --> 11:29.636
so He preserves and He protects.

11:29.837 --> 11:36.650
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

11:36.851 --> 11:42.597
to have our ascent in such a way

11:42.798 --> 11:47.106
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

11:47.307 --> 11:50.122
we have full dignity;

11:50.323 --> 11:56.019
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

11:56.220 --> 11:59.567
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

11:59.768 --> 12:02.993
and do it with our heart genuinely.

12:03.194 --> 12:06.936
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

12:07.983 --> 12:11.457
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

12:11.658 --> 12:13.965
that is, the Kundalini.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.501
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

12:17.721 --> 12:21.640
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

12:21.866 --> 12:27.594
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

12:27.795 --> 12:31.329
because this is the color of Australia.

12:31.530 --> 12:35.625
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

12:35.826 --> 12:39.619
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

12:39.820 --> 12:43.333
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

12:43.534 --> 12:48.885
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

12:49.086 --> 12:52.466
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.653
So this one also is just the other way round,

12:54.854 --> 12:58.713
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

12:58.914 --> 13:02.808
This is a very traditional combination

13:03.009 --> 13:08.259
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

13:10.186 --> 13:16.502
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

13:16.703 --> 13:18.940
can become absolutely black,

13:19.141 --> 13:23.053
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

13:23.254 --> 13:32.703
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

13:32.904 --> 13:36.268
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

13:36.469 --> 13:41.492
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

13:42.554 --> 13:47.453
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

13:47.654 --> 13:49.796
and that’s why the color is green

13:49.997 --> 13:53.036
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

13:53.237 --> 13:56.491
at least She’s covered with.

13:56.772 --> 14:00.562
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

14:00.763 --> 14:03.436
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

14:03.637 --> 14:06.722
element is the Mother Earth.

14:07.919 --> 14:13.848
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

14:14.662 --> 14:18.617
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

14:18.818 --> 14:21.561
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

14:21.762 --> 14:26.847
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

14:28.056 --> 14:29.056
It is said this ….

14:29.257 --> 14:32.685
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

14:32.886 --> 14:35.365
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

14:35.566 --> 14:36.425
What’s she say?

14:36.626 --> 14:37.519
[They cannot hear.]

14:37.720 --> 14:38.945
You can’t hear Me?e …]

14:39.146 --> 14:40.146
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

14:40.361 --> 14:44.095
All right, so I’ll have to shout.

14:44.910 --> 14:45.972
Not at all?

14:46.173 --> 14:47.523
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

14:47.724 --> 14:50.441
All right. Should I use this?

14:52.107 --> 14:55.013
All right. This you can hear.

14:57.817 --> 15:03.242
So I’m now going to tell you

15:03.443 --> 15:06.388
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

15:06.589 --> 15:10.955
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

15:11.156 --> 15:15.300
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

15:15.501 --> 15:17.748
they don’t know what they are talking.

15:17.949 --> 15:21.541
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

15:21.742 --> 15:24.171
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

15:24.372 --> 15:29.582
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

15:31.001 --> 15:35.108
So He’s the first one created.

15:35.761 --> 15:38.489
Now it’s very symbolic:

15:38.690 --> 15:41.762
the pure power

15:41.963 --> 15:49.463
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

15:49.664 --> 15:54.269
The primordial Gauri is that power

15:54.470 --> 15:58.444
which has separated from Her Lord,

15:58.641 --> 16:01.469
we can say.

16:02.388 --> 16:05.942
In Her previous lives She was separated,

16:06.143 --> 16:09.805
and again She’s born as Parvati.

16:10.006 --> 16:15.474
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

16:17.072 --> 16:19.807
So now the marriage has taken place,

16:20.008 --> 16:23.741
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

16:23.942 --> 16:27.387
The wedding kindling has to start.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.767
But She’s not yet married,

16:29.968 --> 16:31.853
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

16:32.054 --> 16:40.298
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

16:40.774 --> 16:44.725
Before that She wants to have a bath,

16:44.926 --> 16:47.866
because She has to meet Her Lord.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.615
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

16:51.816 --> 16:56.980
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

16:58.036 --> 17:00.936
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

17:01.137 --> 17:04.058
when She’s having Her bath.

17:04.968 --> 17:07.227
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

17:07.428 --> 17:12.137
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

17:12.338 --> 17:14.615
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

17:14.816 --> 17:18.433
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

17:19.222 --> 17:22.528
So She closes the door,

17:22.729 --> 17:27.580
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

17:28.082 --> 17:38.829
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

17:39.030 --> 17:42.312
for the bride specially it is the right one,

17:42.513 --> 17:45.266
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

17:45.467 --> 17:48.676
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

17:48.877 --> 17:53.134
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.670
She puts that – is made of camphor

17:59.871 --> 18:03.842
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

18:04.043 --> 18:08.582
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

18:08.783 --> 18:14.322
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

18:14.887 --> 18:17.554
She’s having Her bath nicely.

18:17.755 --> 18:22.852
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

18:23.053 --> 18:25.404
She doesn’t hear Him.

18:25.605 --> 18:31.487
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

18:32.426 --> 18:34.770
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

18:34.961 --> 18:39.560
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

18:39.774 --> 18:42.521
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

18:42.722 --> 18:45.585
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

18:45.786 --> 18:49.655
See now the Immaculate Conception,

18:49.856 --> 18:52.174
try to understand.

18:52.375 --> 19:00.321
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

19:00.522 --> 19:05.324
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

19:05.525 --> 19:10.036
So He cuts His neck in anger,

19:10.237 --> 19:12.839
and He enters into the bathroom.

19:13.041 --> 19:16.920
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

19:17.127 --> 19:21.066
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

19:21.267 --> 19:26.071
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

19:26.272 --> 19:31.000
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

19:31.201 --> 19:34.238
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

19:34.439 --> 19:38.117
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

19:38.318 --> 19:41.146
How dare You kill Him?”

19:41.441 --> 19:43.535
She said, “ Now what to do?”

19:43.736 --> 19:46.347
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

19:46.548 --> 19:54.112
and find the head of any animal that is available,

19:54.313 --> 19:58.464
and we will put that on this trunk

19:58.681 --> 20:02.280
and He’ll be My son again.”

20:02.481 --> 20:06.640
Now it’s all prearranged;

20:06.848 --> 20:10.759
because this child was not to grow into

20:10.960 --> 20:13.842
a human ego and superego business.

20:14.043 --> 20:18.214
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

20:18.415 --> 20:23.750
embodiment of childlike innocence,

20:23.951 --> 20:26.999
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.761
So they had to get the head of an animal.

20:30.962 --> 20:39.887
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

20:40.088 --> 20:43.659
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

20:43.860 --> 20:47.586
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

20:47.970 --> 20:51.704
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

20:51.905 --> 20:55.788
was lying down with her back towards her child,

20:55.989 --> 20:59.536
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

20:59.737 --> 21:01.880
towards their children, never.

21:02.081 --> 21:05.717
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

21:05.918 --> 21:09.210
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

21:09.411 --> 21:12.931
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

21:13.132 --> 21:15.700
but she would never put the child at the back.

21:15.901 --> 21:19.596
So the head of that little animal was cut,

21:19.797 --> 21:23.815
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.812
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

21:28.013 --> 21:37.394
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

21:38.660 --> 21:43.346
So the body is from Mahakali,

21:43.547 --> 21:49.047
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

21:53.213 --> 22:01.110
Now this Ganesha within us resides

22:01.311 --> 22:04.311
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

22:04.920 --> 22:09.616
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

22:09.817 --> 22:16.137
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

22:16.338 --> 22:18.948
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

22:19.149 --> 22:22.615
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

22:22.801 --> 22:25.394
and that’s how they started all these perversions

22:25.595 --> 22:28.041
and wrong things about Ganesha.

22:28.257 --> 22:31.824
But He is embodiment of innocence,

22:32.025 --> 22:36.432
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

22:36.641 --> 22:42.640
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

22:42.845 --> 22:46.752
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

22:46.953 --> 22:49.727
on this Earth as Kalki.

22:49.928 --> 22:52.570
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

22:52.771 --> 22:54.735
such a dynamic personality like Him,

22:54.936 --> 22:58.386
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

22:58.601 --> 23:00.306
And it is impossible,

23:00.507 --> 23:02.535
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

23:02.736 --> 23:07.721
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

23:07.934 --> 23:13.725
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

23:13.921 --> 23:18.080
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

23:18.261 --> 23:22.221
who has no power to kill anyone.

23:22.681 --> 23:25.920
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

23:26.102 --> 23:29.687
I don’t know how they manage these things.

23:31.829 --> 23:34.299
They catch hold of one thing,

23:34.500 --> 23:36.773
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

23:36.974 --> 23:40.469
now how are they authorized, God knows?

23:40.670 --> 23:44.070
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

23:44.271 --> 23:47.449
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

23:47.650 --> 23:49.694
He said it in such a good way,

23:49.895 --> 23:53.666
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

23:53.867 --> 23:57.206
that “Those who are,

23:57.407 --> 24:00.197
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

24:00.398 --> 24:03.147
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

24:03.348 --> 24:07.031
very clearly. Why did He say so?

24:07.232 --> 24:11.245
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

24:11.446 --> 24:14.021
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

24:14.222 --> 24:17.033
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

24:17.234 --> 24:20.232
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

24:20.433 --> 24:22.323
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

24:22.524 --> 24:25.308
you have a special right.

24:25.509 --> 24:28.261
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

24:28.462 --> 24:32.745
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

24:32.946 --> 24:37.133
because you have spoilt your innocence.

24:37.551 --> 24:41.097
They have not spoilt their innocence.

24:41.553 --> 24:43.240
So though you may call yourself Christians,

24:43.441 --> 24:47.346
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

24:47.561 --> 24:50.092
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

24:50.293 --> 24:52.842
which we have ruined.

24:53.681 --> 24:56.800
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

24:57.001 --> 25:00.094
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

25:00.295 --> 25:02.640
a conditioning;

25:02.863 --> 25:09.097
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.941
You must re-establish your innocence.

25:12.142 --> 25:17.464
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

25:17.665 --> 25:21.080
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

25:21.281 --> 25:25.477
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

25:25.678 --> 25:29.366
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

25:29.567 --> 25:32.316
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

25:32.517 --> 25:35.224
we could not fall into anything.

25:35.425 --> 25:38.795
India is like, large like an elephant.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.803
Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

25:42.004 --> 25:43.891
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

25:44.092 --> 25:46.620
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

25:46.821 --> 25:49.632
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

25:49.833 --> 25:51.786
we never accepted him.

25:51.987 --> 25:55.165
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

25:55.366 --> 25:59.605
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

25:59.801 --> 26:01.965
so nothing got into their heads.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.000
They never spoiled their innocence,

26:04.201 --> 26:07.560
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

26:07.761 --> 26:10.521
to new ideas.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.705
And that’s how they have, despite everything

26:14.921 --> 26:16.780
they are not converted Christians,

26:16.981 --> 26:18.805
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

26:19.006 --> 26:22.161
They have maintained their innocence much more

26:22.375 --> 26:24.853
and their sincerity of their heart,

26:25.054 --> 26:27.543
because they are not disconnected.

26:27.761 --> 26:29.880
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

26:30.064 --> 26:34.029
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

26:34.230 --> 26:36.960
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

26:37.161 --> 26:40.161
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

26:40.362 --> 26:42.906
they know in their – that it is wrong.

26:43.107 --> 26:44.904
They may try, I mean, like people steal

26:45.105 --> 26:49.107
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

26:49.308 --> 26:54.650
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

26:54.851 --> 27:01.374
our position as innocent people.

27:01.628 --> 27:04.924
But your Mother is very gracious,

27:05.125 --> 27:08.729
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

27:08.930 --> 27:15.773
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

27:15.996 --> 27:19.220
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

27:19.421 --> 27:21.968
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

27:22.169 --> 27:25.919
that you can come so close to Me.

27:26.784 --> 27:31.784
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

27:34.899 --> 27:40.149
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

27:40.350 --> 27:43.404
but Shri Ganesha.

27:44.276 --> 27:50.135
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

27:50.481 --> 27:54.890
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

27:55.091 --> 27:57.521
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

27:57.738 --> 28:00.942
you have no idea at all.

28:01.143 --> 28:07.182
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

28:08.034 --> 28:11.141
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

28:11.342 --> 28:13.794
that is being also established.

28:13.995 --> 28:16.485
You’ll get back your innocence.

28:16.686 --> 28:20.582
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

28:20.783 --> 28:22.148
one has to learn, that

28:22.349 --> 28:26.632
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

28:26.833 --> 28:30.786
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

28:31.495 --> 28:33.576
He’s so dedicated.

28:33.777 --> 28:38.142
There’s a story once when Parvati,

28:38.343 --> 28:42.022
His Mother gave –

28:43.592 --> 28:47.316
said that “I will give You a big present,

28:47.517 --> 28:50.363
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

28:50.564 --> 28:54.528
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

28:54.729 --> 28:58.830
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

28:59.031 --> 29:01.930
Is the, all the destructive powers

29:02.131 --> 29:04.879
were combined to create Kartikeya.

29:05.080 --> 29:10.577
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

29:10.778 --> 29:13.621
I’ll give You a prize.”

29:14.421 --> 29:19.735
So, the conveyance of

29:19.936 --> 29:23.343
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

29:23.544 --> 29:27.926
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

29:28.220 --> 29:33.406
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

29:33.607 --> 29:36.825
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

29:37.026 --> 29:40.971
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

29:41.676 --> 29:43.960
She has created all the gods.

29:44.161 --> 29:47.253
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

29:47.454 --> 29:50.106
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

29:50.307 --> 29:53.290
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

29:53.491 --> 29:57.648
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

29:57.849 --> 30:00.702
only thrice and He got the prize.

30:00.903 --> 30:05.160
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

30:05.457 --> 30:08.785
He fought even Shiva.

30:09.087 --> 30:11.930
He fought everyone.

30:12.167 --> 30:15.400
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

30:15.601 --> 30:19.390
that shows complete dedication.

30:19.591 --> 30:21.715
And for Sahaja yogis

30:21.916 --> 30:27.362
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

30:27.563 --> 30:33.836
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

30:36.008 --> 30:39.714
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

30:39.915 --> 30:43.282
that’s important, though I am so close.

30:43.686 --> 30:49.203
Even Christ would not say anything;

30:49.404 --> 30:54.552
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

30:55.088 --> 30:57.171
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

30:57.372 --> 31:02.047
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

31:02.248 --> 31:05.287
But you forget.

31:05.530 --> 31:11.174
So it is important to understand that they were great

31:11.375 --> 31:16.272
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

31:16.473 --> 31:19.833
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

31:20.034 --> 31:22.471
which Raul Bai will teach you,

31:22.672 --> 31:26.484
so that you do not make any mistakes

31:26.685 --> 31:29.479
of saying things which are not proper.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.805
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

31:32.006 --> 31:34.946
but consciously if you work it out

31:35.147 --> 31:38.342
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

31:38.543 --> 31:41.356
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

31:41.557 --> 31:45.455
anything, can you believe it?

31:45.952 --> 31:49.978
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

31:50.179 --> 31:54.171
anything against the Holy Spirit.

31:56.121 --> 31:58.542
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

31:58.743 --> 32:03.521
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

32:03.741 --> 32:06.979
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

32:07.180 --> 32:10.348
and how far to go, how far to understand

32:10.561 --> 32:16.275
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

32:16.763 --> 32:19.250
So today we have a great day

32:19.451 --> 32:27.021
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

32:27.222 --> 32:31.247
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

32:31.448 --> 32:34.717
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

32:34.918 --> 32:36.918
About the times and timings,

32:37.119 --> 32:39.954
one should know that Mother knows best,

32:40.155 --> 32:43.742
and everything works out with the timing properly.

32:43.943 --> 32:49.396
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

32:50.357 --> 32:54.269
and all the timings work out in that way.

32:54.470 --> 32:58.052
So everything has to work in the way,

32:58.253 --> 33:00.677
actually the timings are of the moon,

33:00.878 --> 33:03.453
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

33:03.654 --> 33:05.535
what time this works out, this thing, that.

33:05.736 --> 33:08.145
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

33:08.346 --> 33:12.792
work out according to My understanding.

33:12.993 --> 33:17.681
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

33:17.882 --> 33:21.007
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.376
Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

33:23.577 --> 33:26.372
And if your ego is there or anything,

33:26.573 --> 33:30.135
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

33:32.071 --> 33:33.479
All right?

33:33.680 --> 33:37.550
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

33:37.751 --> 33:39.419
as Modi will be doing,

33:39.620 --> 33:43.780
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

33:43.981 --> 33:47.996
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.
