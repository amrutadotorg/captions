00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:37.875
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

00:00:41.072 --> 00:00:44.479
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:10.336
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:23.337
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

00:01:23.538 --> 00:01:34.241
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:38.217
of the Mother and Christ.

00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:58.862
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:05.428
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.020
And when they could not explain it,

00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:23.980
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.144
Even before Christ, they used to have

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:41.728
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:48.919
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:10.680
to worship what they call Yahovah.

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:22.668
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

00:03:29.517 --> 00:03:35.492
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:42.245
She incarnated before also.

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:48.863
She incarnated as Sita,

00:03:50.374 --> 00:03:56.362
and then She incarnated as Radha,

00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:01.989
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.277
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:12.603
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:26.546
He was the son of Radha.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.830
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:44.606
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:52.089
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

00:04:52.290 --> 00:05:01.345
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:14.993
All the description about Jesus Christ

00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:22.709
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:39.223
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:41.836
with immaculate conception,

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:48.130
which She had done before also, as Radha.

00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:14.691
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

00:06:20.783 --> 00:06:27.748
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:40.915
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

00:06:41.116 --> 00:06:47.028
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

00:06:55.473 --> 00:07:00.152
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:15.981
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:31.486
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:36.511
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

00:07:36.712 --> 00:07:42.929
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

00:07:57.786 --> 00:08:05.279
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:21.184
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

00:08:27.263 --> 00:08:34.658
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:44.088
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:50.388
because He is just vibrations.

00:08:53.203 --> 00:09:01.027
So when you do puja to Me,

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:07.552
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

00:09:18.588 --> 00:09:22.144
If they had done puja to Christ -

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:30.058
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:44.470
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:53.894
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

00:10:03.453 --> 00:10:09.615
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:24.845
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

00:10:33.302 --> 00:10:38.264
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:47.978
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:53.430
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

00:10:57.707 --> 00:11:01.209
which is the swayambhu,

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.865
is created by the Mother Earth.

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:13.325
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:26.221
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

00:11:34.517 --> 00:11:43.086
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

00:11:48.182 --> 00:11:53.709
So I went to see that place

00:11:53.910 --> 00:12:01.486
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:06.183
about say, five inches, at the most.

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:17.146
And the face was just like Mine,

00:12:18.844 --> 00:12:22.254
exactly like Mine.

00:12:22.455 --> 00:12:29.484
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

00:12:29.685 --> 00:12:38.273
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.814
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

00:12:53.015 --> 00:12:58.794
and they started following under a rock,

00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:10.305
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:16.334
And in that light they walked,

00:13:16.535 --> 00:13:19.720
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

00:13:19.921 --> 00:13:25.894
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

00:13:38.405 --> 00:13:44.803
So they worship that statue in that place.

00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:54.448
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:02.407
as I give you vibrations,

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:06.000
but not so much

00:14:06.413 --> 00:14:09.568
as I give you.

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:13.786
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:17.926
who might be giving you vibrations.

00:14:21.392 --> 00:14:25.560
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:29.317
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:33.965
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:47.474
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:52.352
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

00:15:00.363 --> 00:15:07.463
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.530
and there are many sweet water wells there.

00:15:20.995 --> 00:15:24.265
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:28.040
many people took photograph.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:38.106
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:45.467
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:55.460
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

00:15:55.682 --> 00:16:01.264
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

00:16:14.696 --> 00:16:19.713
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

00:16:19.914 --> 00:16:24.878
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

00:16:34.312 --> 00:16:37.765
Same is the puja.

00:16:38.106 --> 00:16:45.463
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

00:16:48.671 --> 00:16:56.873
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:10.259
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

00:17:18.317 --> 00:17:20.851
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

00:17:21.052 --> 00:17:29.960
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

00:17:37.401 --> 00:17:45.796
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

00:17:49.696 --> 00:17:53.455
what powers He gives you.

00:17:54.054 --> 00:17:56.271
When you praise those qualities,

00:17:56.472 --> 00:18:03.348
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

00:18:14.058 --> 00:18:17.815
This is how the Divine works,

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:24.680
as if you get charged with those qualities.

00:18:28.687 --> 00:18:34.991
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

00:18:38.855 --> 00:18:46.495
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:55.289
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.588
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

00:19:05.637 --> 00:19:08.302
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

00:19:08.502 --> 00:19:11.861
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

00:19:12.062 --> 00:19:16.432
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

00:19:30.103 --> 00:19:37.455
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.746
It could not happen earlier,

00:19:53.654 --> 00:20:01.488
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

00:20:07.593 --> 00:20:13.445
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:16.607
that I look like you, I behave like you,

00:20:16.808 --> 00:20:18.694
I have made Myself exactly like you -

00:20:18.895 --> 00:20:23.011
very difficult to make, but I have.

00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:48.371
And this body has to bear lots of things

00:20:48.572 --> 00:20:58.309
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

00:21:09.086 --> 00:21:12.435
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

00:21:12.636 --> 00:21:16.414
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

00:21:16.615 --> 00:21:20.651
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

00:21:20.852 --> 00:21:26.179
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.819
and moving very fast.

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:46.668
Now I have to bear it.

00:21:46.869 --> 00:21:51.978
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

00:21:58.764 --> 00:22:04.603
Because He is very direct,

00:22:06.931 --> 00:22:13.500
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

00:22:20.662 --> 00:22:25.853
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

00:22:26.054 --> 00:22:34.108
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:52.623
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

00:22:52.832 --> 00:22:57.330
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

00:22:57.546 --> 00:23:01.981
so I take time to take them out.

00:23:17.649 --> 00:23:20.077
So all these things are very symbolic,

00:23:20.278 --> 00:23:25.290
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

00:23:30.868 --> 00:23:36.301
And that symbol actually acts.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.577
For example if you give somebody a flower,

00:23:42.778 --> 00:23:47.584
that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

00:23:47.785 --> 00:23:52.238
and gratitude comes in.

00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:06.057
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

00:24:06.258 --> 00:24:14.550
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

00:24:26.955 --> 00:24:31.435
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:34.648
and of their blessings on you.

00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:39.655
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

00:24:48.449 --> 00:24:52.486
That is how the Divine acts.

00:24:55.713 --> 00:25:04.546
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

00:25:09.427 --> 00:25:11.894
Now we are doing puja at this time,

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:16.174
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:23.718
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

00:25:38.372 --> 00:25:42.220
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

00:25:42.421 --> 00:25:45.115
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:50.388
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:53.598
Now they are getting the same blessings,

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:55.545
though you are doing the puja

00:25:55.746 --> 00:26:00.525
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

00:26:18.398 --> 00:26:26.386
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

00:26:26.587 --> 00:26:29.970
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:34.494
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

00:26:34.695 --> 00:26:39.639
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

00:26:58.488 --> 00:27:01.931
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

00:27:02.132 --> 00:27:07.724
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

00:27:16.687 --> 00:27:19.926
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

00:27:20.127 --> 00:27:25.640
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

00:27:37.116 --> 00:27:44.588
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

00:27:50.546 --> 00:27:54.877
So you should be very relaxed about it.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:00.931
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

00:28:02.964 --> 00:28:06.007
May God bless you all.

00:28:10.249 --> 00:28:14.340
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:17.466
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

00:28:17.667 --> 00:28:20.911
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

00:28:21.112 --> 00:28:23.044
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

00:28:23.245 --> 00:28:26.633
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

00:28:28.002 --> 00:28:31.916
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

00:28:35.176 --> 00:28:36.982
The children have to wash the Feet

00:28:37.183 --> 00:28:43.515
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.
