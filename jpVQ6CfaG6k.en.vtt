00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:14.521
Medical Conference at Ecological University of Bucharest

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:24.825
Medical Conference, Ecological University of Bucharest (Romania),

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:34.212
2 August 1995.

00:03:52.184 --> 00:03:55.731
So all the professors,

00:03:55.731 --> 00:04:01.287
the Vice Chancellor who was so kind

00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:07.808
to invite Me here to talk to you about something which is very different,

00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:23.081
I would say in a way, very different from the medical science I have studied.

00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:37.291
I would not call it different but it is, I would say, it is the basis of our medicine.

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:43.174
For example if you want to treat the tree for its sickness

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:46.102
and you start applying things from outside

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:52.067
it doesn’t work out so well.

00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:59.148
It may have reactions also.

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:05.041
But if you can somehow go to the roots,

00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:09.793
then the whole tree can be treated.

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:22.882
Our medical science now, in the modern times, has become very specialized,

00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:31.882
to such an extent that you may have a doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:36.106
and there is no synthesis.

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:43.673
There’s no treatment to the totality of the human being.

00:05:43.673 --> 00:05:53.765
This leads to problems and has created many kinds of reactions.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:06:03.954
So today I’m going to talk to you about the subtle system that is within us.

00:06:03.954 --> 00:06:08.208
You should not take Me for granted,

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:14.834
there should not be any blind faith about it

00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:25.775
but if it is proved, this hypothesis that I put before you,

00:06:25.775 --> 00:06:33.677
then as scientists you must keep your minds open

00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:42.991
and then you can accept it as honest people

00:06:43.154 --> 00:07:00.139
because it is for the benevolence of yourself, your family, your country and the world at large.

00:07:00.964 --> 00:07:04.655
The fundamental thing about us is

00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:15.747
that we have these seven main centers of energy within us.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:21.389
We know about different plexuses

00:07:22.653 --> 00:07:27.784
which work on the physical side

00:07:27.784 --> 00:07:43.304
but the ones which supply energy to these plexuses on physical, mental, emotional side, also spiritual are these centers.

00:07:43.304 --> 00:07:55.542
Also I would like to tell you about a energy that resides in the triangular bone known as “sacrum”.

00:07:58.872 --> 00:08:08.921
That means Greeks knew about this bone that they call it as “sacred” bone.

00:08:09.943 --> 00:08:17.253
Now, this energy is the fifth energy that we have, we should say.

00:08:17.253 --> 00:08:26.253
We have left and right sympathetic nervous system even autonomous nervous system.

00:08:26.428 --> 00:08:35.017
They are supplied by two subtle channels on the left and right side.

00:08:35.017 --> 00:08:42.903
Then we have parasympathetic nervous system in the center.

00:08:42.903 --> 00:08:53.879
Supposing you are afraid and you run fast in emergency,

00:08:53.879 --> 00:09:04.911
so your heart starts pumping more blood and you get higher rate of your pulses.

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:12.256
As you know that this is done with sympathetic nervous system.

00:09:12.256 --> 00:09:18.608
But what brings it down is the parasympathetic,

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:25.185
cools it down, is the parasympathetic.

00:09:25.661 --> 00:09:36.659
This parasympathetic nervous system is also supported by another channel.

00:09:37.032 --> 00:09:53.293
Now the fourth energy that we have is a energy by which whatever we achieve in our evolution is recorded,

00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:59.149
that is our central nervous system.

00:09:59.149 --> 00:10:10.289
This central nervous system has recorded whatever we have achieved up to this human awareness.

00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:23.109
We have so many types of higher awareness than animals.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:33.170
For example animals don’t understand filth or dirt…

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:39.804
they don’t understand beauty, they don’t understand colors.

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:48.455
So many subtle things that we understand, animals don’t understand.

00:10:48.455 --> 00:11:05.721
Of course they have many things built-in them, accordingly they behave.

00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:11.292
But human beings have freedom.

00:11:11.299 --> 00:11:19.553
Now this energy within us is the fifth energy as I call it.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.742
We call it as Kundalini in Sanskrit language.

00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:33.674
Kundalini, because it is in three and a half coils

00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:39.724
and a coil is called as kundala.

00:11:39.724 --> 00:11:48.724
It’s called as Kundalini because it is a feminine coiled energy.

00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:55.015
This knowledge was known in India since long time,

00:11:55.015 --> 00:12:08.517
that this energy, if it is awakened it passes through six centers

00:12:09.134 --> 00:12:14.405
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:12:14.405 --> 00:12:20.427
which is the actualization of your baptism

00:12:21.893 --> 00:12:30.321
and connects you to the all-pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:12:30.321 --> 00:12:34.313
In Koran they call it “Ruh.”

00:12:34.313 --> 00:12:43.203
In the Bible it’s called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:12:43.203 --> 00:12:49.914
or all-pervading Power of Divine Love,

00:12:49.914 --> 00:12:55.993
in Sanskrit it is called as Paramchaitanya.

00:12:55.993 --> 00:13:09.867
So when we see these beautiful flowers, we don’t even see and never even think that what a miracle it is.

00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:21.339
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart he’ll say the “autonomous nervous system.”

00:13:21.752 --> 00:13:27.292
But who is this “auto”?

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:33.133
That question if you ask they can’t answer.

00:13:33.132 --> 00:13:44.708
There are many things in medical science that we cannot answer.

00:13:44.802 --> 00:13:55.949
For example anything foreign that goes in our body has to be thrown away, that’s the nature of our body.

00:13:55.949 --> 00:14:06.609
But when the fetus is embedded in the womb it is kept there

00:14:06.609 --> 00:14:12.784
and nourished and is thrown out at the right time.

00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:15.705
So who does that?

00:14:15.705 --> 00:14:20.626
There are many questions science cannot answer.

00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:28.086
Because science is amoral, it has created lots of problems.

00:14:28.348 --> 00:14:39.581
It can produce hydrogen bomb, atomic bomb, anything

00:14:39.588 --> 00:14:44.748
and no one can control it.

00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:58.816
So we have to go to something deeper and find out if there’s any solution within ourselves.

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:09.039
Now as I have to talk to doctors, I would like to explain about one center,

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:17.840
how it can create problems when it is in jeopardy.

00:15:20.446 --> 00:15:28.032
As you see, there is left and right, two sympathetic nervous systems.

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:38.916
When I was studying medicine that time they didn’t know that they have different functions.

00:15:38.916 --> 00:15:45.472
But they have absolutely two different functions.

00:15:45.448 --> 00:15:53.698
The left side caters to your emotional side, the psychology as you can call it

00:15:53.698 --> 00:16:05.951
and the right side caters to your physical and your mental, means your brain functions.

00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:13.177
English “mental” word it is ambiguous you know.

00:16:13.403 --> 00:16:20.311
I mean the activity of the brain and the physical activity.

00:16:20.311 --> 00:16:30.728
Now we can talk of the second center because in this short time, whatever is possible, I think I’ll explain about one center.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:42.918
This is very useful for doctors, for bureaucrats, for people who plan, for politicians

00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:55.070
how one center when in jeopardy, how it can create problems.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:17:01.538
Now there’s one thing yet not known to the medical science this time:

00:17:01.538 --> 00:17:15.836
when we think too much, what thing gives energy to our gray cells?

00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:24.425
We are using the energy of gray cells but who replaces it?

00:17:24.425 --> 00:17:29.454
According to Sahaja Yoga it is the second center within us, we call it Swadisthan,

00:17:29.454 --> 00:17:38.454
which replaces the energy in the brain cells.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:46.189
Now this working takes place like this we can say,

00:17:46.189 --> 00:18:03.188
the left and the right sympathetic nervous system meet like this and form the center, parasympathetic.

00:18:04.489 --> 00:18:11.979
And this center is the center of energy.

00:18:11.979 --> 00:18:20.979
In medical terminology we can say it looks after the aortic plexus.

00:18:22.287 --> 00:18:26.167
Now this center, when on the right side,

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:34.345
it supplies energy to your brain cells when you think too much,

00:18:34.345 --> 00:18:42.631
or the conscious effort.

00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:46.734
Now, when you start using this power too much,

00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:55.734
you neglect other organs which are dependent on this center.

00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:02.830
The first and foremost is liver.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:07.162
Liver is affected by that.

00:19:07.154 --> 00:19:13.225
As you know, liver is responsible for taking out all the poison from the body as heat

00:19:13.225 --> 00:19:21.024
and put it in the circulation of blood.

00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:30.315
Now when the liver goes out, the heat accumulates in the liver.

00:19:32.747 --> 00:19:36.827
It starts passing upward.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:43.643
So we have another center which we call as right heart,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:50.895
which looks after the lungs.

00:19:50.895 --> 00:19:55.411
So you get asthma.

00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:59.909
Now in India, one doctor has done research on asthma,

00:19:59.909 --> 00:20:08.909
with Sahaja Yoga he has proved you can cure asthma completely.

00:20:09.399 --> 00:20:17.123
So then, this heat can also pass to the heart.

00:20:17.123 --> 00:20:21.829
Supposing a young man of say eighteen/nineteen, plays tennis,

00:20:21.829 --> 00:20:29.928
too much physical exertion, drinks a lot, thinks a lot,

00:20:33.173 --> 00:20:44.903
at that young age he might get a very massive heart attack which is fatal, always.

00:20:44.903 --> 00:21:01.800
But later on in age also it might accumulate and people can get massive heart attacks, not angina, massive heart attacks.

00:21:02.316 --> 00:21:10.967
Then it goes further still, that people can get paralysis of the right side.

00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:15.246
The latest is yuppie’s disease, I don’t know if you have heard about,

00:21:15.246 --> 00:21:22.260
yuppie’s disease they call it in America, very common,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.704
where the conscious mind becomes absolutely paralyzed

00:21:26.704 --> 00:21:34.010
because you have used too much of your conscious mind.

00:21:36.185 --> 00:21:41.588
The brain is in working order,

00:21:41.588 --> 00:21:47.438
but not hands, feet, nothing, one becomes like a reptile.

00:21:47.691 --> 00:21:51.457
Very common now in America.

00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:59.290
And you have to carry the patient like a fish.

00:22:00.226 --> 00:22:05.629
But he speaks all right, his brain is all right,

00:22:05.922 --> 00:22:12.266
otherwise he cannot do any action, of walking or …

00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:19.871
Now when this heat goes towards the left side of your abdomen

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:28.871
it creates another problem -because of the pancreas, it gives you diabetes.

00:22:29.179 --> 00:22:46.388
Only people who sit on chairs and are futuristic, who are planning, politicians, this that, doctors also, they get diabetes.

00:22:46.445 --> 00:23:01.343
For example in India, we have farmers who earn their living and then sleep nicely, they are not worried about anything.

00:23:01.503 --> 00:23:10.503
They are not money oriented, they are not thinking of future, they don’t insure anything

00:23:10.813 --> 00:23:19.813
and they drink in their tea at least four spoons, full spoons of sugar.

00:23:23.113 --> 00:23:27.287
But they don’t get diabetes. Never.

00:23:27.287 --> 00:23:36.287
We have never heard of any case with these farmers getting diabetes.

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:41.031
Then also because of too much attention for thinking,

00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:48.229
no energy is supplied to your spleen.

00:23:51.767 --> 00:24:00.074
Spleen is for our rhythm, a speedometer, for our rhythm of life.

00:24:00.074 --> 00:24:05.725
So these days the modern life is so chaotic.

00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:14.379
Early in the morning if you read the newspaper you are really shocked.

00:24:14.379 --> 00:24:20.308
Newspapers always describe horrible things, nothing else.

00:24:20.308 --> 00:24:23.618
Nothing to soothe you.

00:24:23.609 --> 00:24:28.010
So, you go into chaos.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:45.466
Then as you know that spleen produces RBC’s when there is emergency.

00:24:49.298 --> 00:25:12.786
For example, if you are eating your food and just you start running you get pain in the spleen.

00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:20.966
So, in the morning, people don’t take their even breakfast, just rush somehow or other,

00:25:20.966 --> 00:25:27.063
because they sleep very late

00:25:31.602 --> 00:25:36.087
and then they get into the car.

00:25:36.087 --> 00:25:45.087
In America, I’m told that they even brush their teeth in the car.

00:25:45.328 --> 00:25:49.391
They have no rhythm of life.

00:25:49.391 --> 00:25:58.391
Then they’ll see the traffic jam and they are very upset

00:25:58.864 --> 00:26:05.118
and in their office now the boss is boiling at them.

00:26:05.118 --> 00:26:14.118
With all this, this poor speedometer doesn’t understand, it becomes crazy.

00:26:15.915 --> 00:26:19.441
Of course, the other side how the cancer is caused,

00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:28.441
I’ve not told you but suddenly the movement goes to the left,

00:26:28.984 --> 00:26:34.242
some sort of a shock, accident, anything

00:26:35.916 --> 00:26:44.916
and you develop a very serious disease called blood cancer.

00:26:45.285 --> 00:26:54.392
With Sahaja Yoga we have cured many people of blood cancer.

00:26:54.672 --> 00:27:06.580
Then it goes to the kidneys and kidneys also go on late, with the heat and you stop urinating.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:18.040
Then you are put on the dialysis where you just become bankrupt and die.

00:27:18.862 --> 00:27:22.988
Ultimately you die.

00:27:22.988 --> 00:27:29.378
There’s no way of saving such people.

00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:33.532
But with Sahaja Yoga you can.

00:27:33.532 --> 00:27:45.028
There was a doctor who was expert as he had lots of machines of dialysis.

00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:49.839
And he got kidney trouble.

00:27:49.839 --> 00:28:02.693
So he came to Me, I said, “You can be cured but on one promise, that you will not put people on dialysis anymore

00:28:02.693 --> 00:28:09.249
because you must admit dialysis cannot cure.”

00:28:09.249 --> 00:28:18.249
He promised, he got cured but he’s still using his machines.

00:28:19.467 --> 00:28:27.558
He told Me he has spent so much money that he has to make money somehow now.

00:28:27.557 --> 00:28:32.558
He’s so much money oriented, you know.

00:28:32.558 --> 00:28:39.293
So, lastly is the worst is that lower part of your intestines,

00:28:39.293 --> 00:28:43.239
also intestines suffer a lot because you get constipation.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:54.059
But the worst type of constipation you can get, piles you can get.

00:28:54.927 --> 00:29:10.064
In Switzerland I was surprised that in the bread they put something we call as the cottonseed.

00:29:10.088 --> 00:29:16.275
And actually we give this in India only to buffalos.

00:29:16.275 --> 00:29:19.539
I was shocked. Why are they using such a hard thing?

00:29:19.539 --> 00:29:25.475
“Because,” they said, “we suffer from constipation.”

00:29:26.866 --> 00:29:32.560
And you know they may start eating grass after some time.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:39.756
So this is the situation with one center

00:29:39.756 --> 00:29:44.847
and so many diseases are caused,

00:29:44.847 --> 00:29:49.910
so if you can cure one of your centers,

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:55.445
you can cure all these diseases.

00:29:57.519 --> 00:30:05.250
Of course about cancer also I would like to tell you in short.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:13.974
As this left and right side meet and form a center

00:30:13.974 --> 00:30:21.383
– now if you are very futuristic you are using right side too much like this

00:30:22.712 --> 00:30:29.610
and using the limited energy of your center too much.

00:30:29.704 --> 00:30:37.007
It could be anywhere, it could be in any center.

00:30:37.848 --> 00:30:45.892
So you go on using it too much, ultimately it happens that it’s exhausted.

00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:53.557
And sometimes with some shock or anything it may just break.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:31:01.668
So there is no connection with the mains.

00:31:01.668 --> 00:31:07.761
As a result malignancy is formed.

00:31:07.753 --> 00:31:14.768
The cells become on their own, there’s no connection of control.

00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:17.133
This I’ve told you in short

00:31:17.133 --> 00:31:23.152
but cancer is curable through Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:23.152 --> 00:31:31.643
Psychologically also many people have been cured.

00:31:31.643 --> 00:31:35.540
That is the left side.

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:40.183
On the left side we have our subconscious of today,

00:31:40.183 --> 00:31:48.576
subconscious of yesterday, subconscious of our all lives.

00:31:48.576 --> 00:31:54.953
And we have beyond that is collective subconscious

00:31:55.632 --> 00:32:04.189
and this collective subconscious has everything that has been created.

00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:10.964
So many things have died in the evolutionary process,

00:32:10.932 --> 00:32:15.392
have gone out of the process of evolution.

00:32:15.392 --> 00:32:21.358
Like there might be some plants

00:32:22.368 --> 00:32:30.421
which we call as bacteria and all these viruses also, the same.

00:32:30.421 --> 00:32:39.421
So, once they enter into your conscious mind or conscious side, you get affected.

00:32:40.832 --> 00:32:52.483
So for cancer, doctors call it …protein 53, 58…, they have given names like that.

00:32:52.483 --> 00:33:00.642
So in Sahaja Yoga your attention is pulled out from the left side brought into the center.

00:33:03.785 --> 00:33:08.456
As a result of that you become all right.

00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:17.571
Also, the highest type of left side affectation is lunacy.

00:33:17.772 --> 00:33:21.005
Also can be cured.

00:33:21.005 --> 00:33:30.005
In this short lecture I cannot give you the list of all the diseases that are curable.

00:33:32.743 --> 00:33:39.323
But if you have the knowledge of medical science it’s much easier.

00:33:39.346 --> 00:33:43.228
But the best part of it that when you become the Spirit,

00:33:43.248 --> 00:33:45.386
when you become one with the Divine Power,

00:33:45.386 --> 00:33:54.052
then on your fingertips you can feel the centers.

00:33:55.414 --> 00:33:59.725
There are five, six and seven for the emotional side

00:33:59.733 --> 00:34:04.109
and again five and six and seven for your right side, meaning

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:15.307
for your physical and your… not mental but brain activities.

00:34:21.099 --> 00:34:24.683
Also the stress and strain you have from these modern times,

00:34:24.683 --> 00:34:33.683
even ecological problems– you become quite immune to it.

00:34:34.944 --> 00:34:45.743
That’s another subject, where you become just thoughtlessly aware.

00:34:45.743 --> 00:34:54.743
The thoughts rise and fall, another thought rises and falls

00:34:55.759 --> 00:35:03.723
and it comes from either from the future or the past.

00:35:03.723 --> 00:35:12.723
But when the Kundalini rises then She elongates these thoughts

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:17.828
and you stay in the present.

00:35:17.828 --> 00:35:23.058
You are thoughtless but fully aware

00:35:23.058 --> 00:35:28.202
and then all the inspirations come in.

00:35:30.583 --> 00:35:44.690
The greatest thing is that the database of the genes are corrected with this.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:56.588
We have known many people who were called as very bad people, evil people are completely changed.

00:35:58.331 --> 00:36:05.807
All your habits which are destructive just drop out

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:10.367
because you become the Spirit.

00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:18.033
Actually you are not this body, this mind,

00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:22.724
you are not these emotions, your intelligence,

00:36:22.716 --> 00:36:29.632
your ego or your conditionings, you are the pure Spirit.

00:36:29.632 --> 00:36:35.005
When you become that, in that light,

00:36:35.073 --> 00:36:40.400
you achieve tremendous powers.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:53.097
Like many people want to give up alcohol and drugs, they can’t, but overnight they will give up.

00:36:53.097 --> 00:36:57.664
It’s like this, supposing there is a snake in My hand

00:36:57.664 --> 00:37:11.406
and there’s darkness and I’m very adamant

00:37:14.979 --> 00:37:22.336
and if you tell Me, ” There’s a
snake.” I’ll say: “No, it’s a rope,”

00:37:22.248 --> 00:37:26.606
because I’m obstinate.

00:37:26.606 --> 00:37:32.812
But if there is little light I’ll definitely throw it away.

00:37:32.812 --> 00:37:42.556
In the same way all habits which you cannot fight, just run away.

00:37:43.023 --> 00:37:48.515
Everything sounds so fantastic, I must say.

00:37:48.459 --> 00:37:52.179
But you are fantastic.

00:37:52.178 --> 00:37:58.060
Like in our country, in a remote village, if you take a television and say,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:08.824
“This box can show you so many things,” they won’t believe.

00:38:09.207 --> 00:38:14.329
They will say, “It is just a box.”

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:22.277
We also think we are just boxes. We have no identity.

00:38:22.277 --> 00:38:32.469
But when you put the television to the mains, then you see how fantastic it is.

00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:36.810
In the same way we are.

00:38:36.801 --> 00:38:40.386
We are built-in that way.

00:38:40.386 --> 00:38:58.894
But when we don’t take to this natural breakthrough of the evolution,

00:38:58.963 --> 00:39:03.813
also there is ecological problem inside.

00:39:06.175 --> 00:39:09.309
Yes. Because I’ve seen people with cancer,

00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:31.362
when they suffer and they take to Sahaja Yoga, the whole room gets heated up without a heater.

00:39:31.445 --> 00:39:34.104
I mean, even if they are sick, if supposing.

00:39:34.104 --> 00:39:37.365
Supposing you are feeling any pain here

00:39:37.365 --> 00:39:45.774
and if with Sahaja Yoga you touch it, it’s very hot.

00:39:47.962 --> 00:39:55.167
So this is the Cool Breeze, we can call it,

00:39:55.182 --> 00:39:58.995
has a cooling effect.

00:39:58.995 --> 00:40:07.618
Also in the western science there’s nothing for cooling.

00:40:10.038 --> 00:40:17.514
In Ayurveda they have, some things, not many but we have

00:40:17.514 --> 00:40:29.940
so they go on heating up – and heated up and heated up, even the brain gets heated up, everybody gets heated up…

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.224
even the nerves get heated up…

00:40:34.255 --> 00:40:42.897
and you have no strength left to fight any illness.

00:40:42.897 --> 00:40:47.554
But this is your own Power.

00:40:47.546 --> 00:40:51.109
There’s no obligation at all.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:58.018
You feel much younger, very energetic.

00:40:58.018 --> 00:41:07.018
Now, I’m seventy-three years of age and I travel every third day

00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:11.245
and I enjoy.

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:18.053
So it’s very easy because it’s your own.

00:41:18.053 --> 00:41:32.809
But medical studies helps you a lot to understand the physical help of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:32.809 --> 00:41:35.555
You don’t have to go for diagnosis,

00:41:35.555 --> 00:41:44.154
when the patient dies half-way when he’s diagnosed – by the time.

00:41:47.316 --> 00:41:57.912
So is best is to diagnose a person on your fingers, which is absolute knowledge, absolute.

00:41:57.912 --> 00:42:02.475
Even if you have ten children

00:42:02.482 --> 00:42:07.099
and tie up their eyes and ask them, “What is this gentleman suffering from?”

00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:15.798
they will all say the same thing.

00:42:21.736 --> 00:42:27.254
Now supposing they show you this finger,

00:42:28.373 --> 00:42:33.738
so you ask the person, “Do you suffer from heart?”

00:42:33.738 --> 00:42:38.355
So he’ll tell you, “Yes, very much, how do you know?”

00:42:38.339 --> 00:42:46.558
Now, if you know how to cure yourself, you can cure others also.

00:42:46.558 --> 00:42:55.558
You can feel the centers of others on your fingertips.

00:42:55.898 --> 00:43:02.310
They may be anywhere, might be dead even, you can feel.

00:43:04.111 --> 00:43:13.111
This is a very subtle subject and also very easy.

00:43:14.912 --> 00:43:19.731
The knowledge is all within yourself

00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:27.925
but after medical studies it relates to science very clearly.

00:43:29.108 --> 00:43:33.021
So it’s very useful for doctors.

00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:40.769
And in a country where we are not so rich like Americans are,

00:43:40.933 --> 00:43:45.577
we need not waste too much money.

00:43:45.577 --> 00:43:47.996
It’s a very large subject

00:43:47.996 --> 00:43:57.510
and I was telling your authorities that I’ll send a doctor who was the Head of the Physiology,

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:02.025
Dean of Physiology from Delhi University,

00:44:02.233 --> 00:44:11.233
who has written a book on Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:23.568
His granddaughter was dying of kidney infection

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:30.491
and she got cured in Sahaja Yoga

00:44:30.573 --> 00:44:39.573
and his wife had migraine, also she got cured in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:40.464 --> 00:44:49.034
So then he started researching Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:49.034 --> 00:44:58.034
He’s written a very good book and was inaugurated by our President in India.

00:44:58.614 --> 00:45:06.186
Of course I would like you to ask Me some questions if you have any.

00:45:09.563 --> 00:45:23.568
Q: I’d like to know, what is in Your opinion the spiritual mission of the Romanian people?

00:45:23.568 --> 00:45:28.099
Shri Mataji: Oh, they are wonderful.

00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:30.822
Oh, they are very sensitive.

00:45:30.822 --> 00:45:38.512
I must say they are the best in the Eastern bloc.

00:45:38.531 --> 00:45:41.983
They are very spiritual.

00:45:41.983 --> 00:45:50.983
I just don’t know, we have now, I think, five thousand Sahaja Yogis

00:45:51.581 --> 00:45:58.510
and I have no words to… really I can’t praise them enough.

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:07.510
It’s true. And they have grown too much.

00:46:16.149 --> 00:46:27.047
Q: You said that lunacy can be cured in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:27.884 --> 00:46:37.566
What do You understand by lunacy: paranoia, schizophrenia, …?

00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:42.119
Shri Mataji: All kinds. All kinds. But not always.

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:47.294
You see, schizophrenia has been cured,

00:46:47.294 --> 00:46:50.624
lunatic personality has been cured,

00:46:50.624 --> 00:46:57.278
lunatic persons from the lunatic asylum.

00:46:57.278 --> 00:47:06.278
We have got three, four people from lunatic asylum in India who got cured.

00:47:07.235 --> 00:47:10.055
Yes, it’s possible. Even AIDS.

00:47:11.475 --> 00:47:17.933
But these AIDS people are extremely aggressive.

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:21.462
They think they are martyrs.

00:47:21.462 --> 00:47:29.689
So, with this martyrdom, you know, they think no end of themselves.

00:47:29.689 --> 00:47:34.197
They are very proud that…

00:47:34.197 --> 00:47:38.837
they think they are fighting a big cause.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:44.203
So we cured about six people in Australia,

00:47:44.203 --> 00:47:56.814
one was T.M. fellow, T.M., Transcendental Meditation, two, two of them…Transcendental…two of them.

00:47:56.821 --> 00:47:59.727
And they told Me that in the beginning

00:47:59.727 --> 00:48:06.500
in the T.M. you are not even supposed to talk to your wife.

00:48:08.666 --> 00:48:12.516
So they became homosexual.

00:48:12.516 --> 00:48:17.835
For years. Both of them.

00:48:17.835 --> 00:48:21.431
Then they got cured,

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:25.121
but they fell back on the same habits

00:48:25.128 --> 00:48:28.748
and after five years they died.

00:48:28.755 --> 00:48:36.358
Then there was one who got cured, he’s nine years now, he’s still there.

00:48:36.363 --> 00:48:45.363
And two were married, a couple who were Catholics, I think,

00:48:45.728 --> 00:48:51.229
so they got a fright.

00:48:51.229 --> 00:49:00.229
I think the priests must have told them to be frightened so they also ran away.

00:49:00.446 --> 00:49:03.799
I don’t know how they are.

00:49:03.799 --> 00:49:07.449
It’s very difficult people,

00:49:07.449 --> 00:49:20.305
it’s a world movement, you see, they think they’re very great soldiers marching towards death.

00:49:22.383 --> 00:49:29.193
It’s a psychological problem, very egoistical

00:49:29.193 --> 00:49:34.058
and they are not afraid of death they say.

00:49:34.058 --> 00:49:41.972
Their immune system is in trouble,

00:49:41.972 --> 00:49:47.448
which is curable through Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:53.453
It is the…here, sternum bone.

00:49:53.453 --> 00:50:00.548
Till the age of twelve years, we develop antibodies here

00:50:00.548 --> 00:50:05.761
and then the whole…they are distributed all over the body.

00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:15.959
So, whenever we are frightened, the sternum bone gives like a remote control, gives palpitations.

00:50:15.959 --> 00:50:24.446
So behind the sternum bone that guides it we call as the central heart.

00:50:24.446 --> 00:50:29.502
If you can cure this central heart

00:50:30.731 --> 00:50:43.741
then we can cure so many diseases, say like breast cancer and many others.

00:50:46.225 --> 00:51:22.824
Q: What do You think about a research study performed here in Bucharest on various patients to prove that Sahaja Yoga can cure and so to blast the medical world?

00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:29.147
Shri Mataji: Ideal. Ideal if you start. We already have a Center of Research in India,

00:51:29.147 --> 00:51:37.947
in a place called Vashi, close to Bombay. We have …

00:51:37.947 --> 00:51:46.947
But you can see, it would be good idea if you want.

00:51:48.945 --> 00:51:55.246
[inaudible]

00:51:56.911 --> 00:52:03.599
Q: Isn’t it dangerous to work on children? For instance there are many children sick of AIDS in Romania.

00:52:03.668 --> 00:52:11.705
Shri Mataji: No, that’s the best thing. Children, it’s harmless, absolutely harmless. Best for children!

00:52:11.705 --> 00:52:19.395
Because they’re so innocent you can work very fast.

00:52:21.579 --> 00:52:41.091
Q: He’s Doctor Damian Nicolae Sandu from Braila. He is a bit skeptical

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:51.022
and he said that “Can’t Sahaja Yoga degenerate into a sect and fanaticism?”

00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:55.403
Shri Mataji: You see, it depends on… some people who become fanatic, I agree,

00:52:55.403 --> 00:53:03.399
but they are corrected because they lose all vibrations.

00:53:03.459 --> 00:53:05.674
Very few.

00:53:08.498 --> 00:53:14.735
They are thrown out, automatically.

00:53:36.056 --> 00:53:40.015
The Rector: We can come to an end at our Conference and

00:53:40.015 --> 00:53:53.697
we thank Mrs. Shri Mataji Who’s presented us very short form Her new medical theory.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:09.096
I [inaudible] for me it is a bit shocking because it does not come in any way close to my paradigm.

00:54:09.096 --> 00:54:16.223
But this does not mean anything.

00:54:16.223 --> 00:54:25.602
We are open, and what I admire in Her is Her optimism.

00:54:25.685 --> 00:54:40.196
Nothing is worse for a doctor than pessimism and to give up in front of illness.

00:54:40.196 --> 00:54:49.196
So that I congratulate Her, especially

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:10.000
because She introduced this high note of optimism even for diseases that we consider nowadays incurable.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Thank you very much.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Another person from the University: Please, allow me, on behalf of the Senate of the University,

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:40.000
to give the Diploma of Doctor in Cognitive Sciences to Mrs. Nirmala Shrivastava

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Who made us a great honor to be here today among us.
