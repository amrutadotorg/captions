SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,660
CABELLA

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:11,659
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:33,390
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:48,529
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

6
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:52,680
you have achieved we have to see it.

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:12,479
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

8
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:23,840
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:34,606
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

10
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:37,877
It’s established.

11
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:43,297
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

12
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:53,817
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

13
00:01:53,817 --> 00:02:01,657
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

14
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:08,057
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

15
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:18,507
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

16
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:26,327
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

17
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:37,167
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

18
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:43,626
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

19
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:54,117
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

20
00:02:54,117 --> 00:03:07,567
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

21
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:21,346
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

22
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:23,817
also starts flowing with it.

23
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:33,957
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

24
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:44,317
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

25
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:47,207
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

26
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:54,527
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

27
00:03:54,527 --> 00:04:01,117
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

28
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:07,107
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

29
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:13,367
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

30
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:21,726
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

31
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:24,207
go to them.

32
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:36,207
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

33
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:40,527
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

34
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:48,937
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

35
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:59,237
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

36
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:05,387
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

37
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:15,857
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

38
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:25,916
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

39
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,617
No one can harm you.

40
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:35,857
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

41
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:45,957
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

42
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:54,027
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

43
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:58,476
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

44
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:02,237
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

45
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:14,457
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

46
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:20,737
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

47
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:29,407
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

48
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,887
He is a religious man.

49
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:36,667
He should also put stones on her.

50
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,967
But He was standing on truth.

51
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:47,476
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

52
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:49,397
that you stand on truth.

53
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:59,767
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

54
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:09,027
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

55
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,977
to the left.

56
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:22,376
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

57
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:27,416
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

58
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:32,717
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

59
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:39,907
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

60
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:44,816
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

61
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:50,907
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

62
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,786
way do that way.

63
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:59,777
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

64
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:10,607
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

65
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:16,107
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

66
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:28,006
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

67
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:32,006
religion even about Sahaj religion.

68
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:39,937
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

69
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,937
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

70
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:53,537
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

71
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:58,147
he is in that truth.

72
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:06,147
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

73
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:10,187
to all of you.

74
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:15,977
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

75
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:23,067
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

76
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:28,217
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

77
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:33,387
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:44,407
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

79
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:47,677
on truth or untruth.

80
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:54,007
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

81
00:09:54,007 --> 00:10:01,347
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

82
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:03,647
branches in the body.

83
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:10,637
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

84
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:14,477
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

85
00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:28,337
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

86
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,587
we have taken.

87
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,477
We have now become dharmic.

88
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:37,007
What is the root of dharma?

89
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:42,427
Why should we be dharmic?

90
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:43,847
What is the need to be dharmic?

91
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:49,307
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

92
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:55,377
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

93
00:10:55,377 --> 00:11:03,457
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

94
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:06,977
enjoyments of these people.

95
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:18,857
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

96
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:20,927
standing on truth.

97
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:27,277
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

98
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:31,107
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

99
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:44,377
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

100
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:46,327
even their language improves.

101
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:57,067
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

102
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:02,237
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

103
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:07,397
This consciousness has to disappear.

104
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:26,217
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

105
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,837
is truth.

106
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:35,487
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

107
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:39,507
As you know the pita of heart is here.

108
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:48,667
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

109
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:55,197
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

110
00:12:55,197 --> 00:13:03,487
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

111
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:09,457
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

112
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:20,757
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

113
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:24,347
love, the pure love.

114
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:33,087
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

115
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:41,547
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

116
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:55,787
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

117
00:13:55,787 --> 00:14:00,717
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

118
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:12,747
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

119
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:18,187
- that’s the personality you have to become.

120
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:26,967
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

121
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:33,857
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

122
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:37,227
person.

123
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:44,187
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

124
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,187
things.

125
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:56,387
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

126
00:14:56,387 --> 00:15:00,567
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

127
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:06,547
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

128
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:09,277
here you are talking like this.

129
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:18,157
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

130
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:25,207
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

131
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:34,507
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

132
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:44,657
to say things by which they become one, united.

133
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:52,277
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

134
00:15:52,277 --> 00:16:03,517
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

135
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:10,218
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

136
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:20,597
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

137
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:25,837
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

138
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:36,437
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

139
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:40,697
collective consciousness.

140
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:44,027
Now people talk of peace.

141
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:50,437
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

142
00:16:50,437 --> 00:17:01,736
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

143
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:13,317
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

144
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,317
fulfilling.

145
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:24,387
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

146
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:33,947
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

147
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:43,117
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

148
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:51,827
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

149
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:54,937
we can change this world.

150
00:17:54,937 --> 00:18:06,337
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

151
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:12,537
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

152
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:15,767
Why do you hate someone.

153
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:22,497
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

154
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:23,947
sake.

155
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:31,417
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

156
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:38,957
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

157
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:45,477
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

158
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:54,907
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

159
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:58,347
This doesn’t stop.

160
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,537
By dividing us what has happened?

161
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:06,517
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

162
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:12,417
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

163
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,687
this that.

164
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:18,277
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

165
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:22,167
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

166
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:31,807
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

167
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:34,087
country being divided.

168
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:43,187
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

169
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:54,217
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

170
00:19:54,217 --> 00:20:02,757
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

171
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:11,417
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

172
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:15,157
Why?

173
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:20,897
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

174
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:24,057
separate houses?

175
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,817
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

176
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:36,187
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

177
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,287
houses.

178
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:44,097
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

179
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:52,807
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

180
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:53,877
are catching.

181
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,957
Isn’t it?

182
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:59,187
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

183
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:05,617
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

184
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:06,617
understand.

185
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:14,157
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

186
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:17,847
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

187
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:26,767
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

188
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,767
to do.

189
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:35,687
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

190
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:44,317
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

191
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:50,897
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

192
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:58,687
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

193
00:21:58,687 --> 00:21:59,687
that.

194
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:05,377
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

195
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,867
So there is nothing like that.

196
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:13,297
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

197
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:16,637
who tries all kinds of tricks.

198
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:29,357
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

199
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:41,287
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

200
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:47,617
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

201
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:52,717
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

202
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:59,177
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

203
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,727
common disease with Indians.

204
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:07,587
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

205
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,447
separate bathrooms.

206
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:13,057
In a collective life there is no need.

207
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:20,067
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

208
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,527
just go there come back, finished.

209
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:27,987
I have no time for all that.

210
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:37,797
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

211
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:42,607
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

212
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:43,607
union?

213
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:45,557
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

214
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:55,827
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

215
00:23:55,827 --> 00:24:02,977
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

216
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:11,617
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

217
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,227
of Himalayas I should say.

218
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:22,277
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

219
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:27,397
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

220
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:38,827
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

221
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:40,647
of it.

222
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:45,207
So we have to be very, very careful.

223
00:24:45,207 --> 00:25:00,357
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

224
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:10,957
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

225
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:17,247
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

226
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:22,867
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

227
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:29,557
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

228
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:42,308
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

229
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:50,237
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

230
00:25:50,237 --> 00:26:04,557
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

231
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:07,277
huge earthquake.

232
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:17,547
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

233
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:24,307
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

234
00:26:24,307 --> 00:26:25,647
under protection.

235
00:26:25,647 --> 00:26:28,617
You are all the time protected.

236
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:34,727
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

237
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:38,447
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

238
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:43,327
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

239
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:50,167
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

240
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:53,397
is protecting you and helping you.

241
00:26:53,397 --> 00:27:00,586
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

242
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:06,027
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

243
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:13,967
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

244
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:20,347
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

245
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:25,837
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

246
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:29,097
All these topics will fall.

247
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:34,267
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

248
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,527
No question.

249
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:37,597
What do I like?

250
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:46,227
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

251
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:48,147
to be this way.

252
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:49,187
Who are you?

253
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:52,677
Ask yourself the question.

254
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:55,227
Who are you?

255
00:27:55,227 --> 00:28:05,227
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

256
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:12,497
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

257
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:17,947
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

258
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,047
This is what you have to reach.

259
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:26,007
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

260
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:35,437
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

261
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:37,297
You have to work it out.

262
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:44,827
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

263
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:48,627
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

264
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:52,667
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

265
00:28:52,667 --> 00:29:00,107
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

266
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:03,377
what about my country.

267
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:09,687
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

268
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:16,557
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

269
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:27,007
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

270
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:28,357
I, I.

271
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:37,336
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

272
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:41,407
for the cleaning of the cotton.

273
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:48,086
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

274
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:54,137
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

275
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:59,407
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

276
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:06,977
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

277
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:13,897
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

278
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:23,657
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

279
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:32,507
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

280
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:41,107
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

281
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:44,077
they plan something very bad.

282
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:46,836
They can do anything.

283
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:51,347
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

284
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:52,837
they don’t do it.

285
00:30:52,837 --> 00:30:56,947
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

286
00:30:56,947 --> 00:31:04,827
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

287
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:06,437
fuss about food.

288
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:13,167
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

289
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,417
- that we are like this, we are that.

290
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:23,967
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

291
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:28,147
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

292
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:33,227
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

293
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:36,977
I said ‘What?’

294
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,867
I couldn’t understand the question.

295
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:44,638
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

296
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:46,277
is there to be proud?

297
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:52,327
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

298
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,397
of.

299
00:31:53,397 --> 00:32:00,927
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

300
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:09,907
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

301
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:13,297
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

302
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:22,076
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

303
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:25,277
it, not at all conscious.

304
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:29,197
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

305
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,797
But it is so, what to do.

306
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:36,347
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

307
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:42,127
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

308
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:49,307
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

309
00:32:49,307 --> 00:32:58,997
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

310
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:08,836
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

311
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:09,836
gold’ - gold is gold.

312
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:13,157
Why will it be proud of that?

313
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:22,527
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

314
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:29,047
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

315
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:30,687
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

316
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:35,617
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

317
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:42,507
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

318
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:48,206
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

319
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:56,086
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

320
00:33:56,086 --> 00:34:03,206
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

321
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:04,757
left in me.

322
00:34:04,757 --> 00:34:11,137
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

323
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:17,807
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

324
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:28,676
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

325
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:38,987
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

326
00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:52,737
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

327
00:34:52,737 --> 00:35:00,987
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

328
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:04,547
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

329
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:14,537
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

330
00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:21,677
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

331
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:25,557
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

332
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:33,607
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

333
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:38,127
false, so how to make these two things meet.

334
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:47,287
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

335
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:48,287
primamvadeth.

336
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:55,847
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

337
00:35:55,847 --> 00:36:04,457
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

338
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:10,977
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

339
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:17,447
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

340
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:25,577
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

341
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:29,547
said to me that I have done something perfect.

342
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:37,237
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

343
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:43,367
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

344
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:48,127
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

345
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:50,327
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

346
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:54,037
All this is the play of ego.

347
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:59,097
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

348
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:02,327
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

349
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:09,567
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

350
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:17,757
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

351
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:22,198
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

352
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:26,927
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

353
00:37:26,927 --> 00:37:32,907
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

354
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:33,907
do?

355
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:39,717
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

356
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:45,517
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

357
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:50,637
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

358
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:53,537
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

359
00:37:53,537 --> 00:38:00,247
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

360
00:38:00,247 --> 00:38:05,497
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

361
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:10,477
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

362
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:17,136
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

363
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:23,047
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

364
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:28,307
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

365
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,757
all the knowledge.

366
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:36,247
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

367
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:45,847
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

368
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:54,467
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

369
00:38:54,467 --> 00:39:01,297
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

370
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,327
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

371
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,227
We have to think of the whole world.

372
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:10,278
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

373
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:14,868
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

374
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:18,917
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

375
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:24,457
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

376
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:27,247
So I am trying to do something for them.

377
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:30,127
You have problems in your countries.

378
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:33,107
You should find out what problems there are.

379
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:39,636
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

380
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:46,517
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

381
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:52,077
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

382
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:53,227
to do it.

383
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:58,057
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

384
00:39:58,057 --> 00:39:59,057
up.

385
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:04,636
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

386
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,727
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

387
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:12,637
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

388
00:40:12,637 --> 00:40:19,107
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

389
00:40:19,107 --> 00:40:25,477
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

390
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:27,587
You are powerful.

391
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:29,597
You have powers.

392
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:33,467
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

393
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:37,097
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

394
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:44,827
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

395
00:40:44,827 --> 00:40:51,626
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

396
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:58,707
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

397
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:02,597
that we are chosen.

398
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:09,717
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

399
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:14,877
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

400
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:19,827
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

401
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:26,207
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

402
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:31,297
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

403
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:43,497
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

404
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:47,987
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

405
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:54,667
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

406
00:41:54,667 --> 00:42:04,997
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

407
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:11,157
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

408
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:19,107
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

409
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:29,597
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

410
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:33,797
is jealousy.

411
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:40,487
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

412
00:42:40,487 --> 00:42:48,817
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

413
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:56,657
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

414
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:03,007
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

415
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:10,537
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

416
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:17,587
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

417
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:21,587
We should not.

418
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:28,567
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

419
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:36,247
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

420
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:42,017
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

421
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:47,277
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

422
00:43:47,277 --> 00:43:51,197
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

423
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:53,947
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

424
00:43:53,947 --> 00:43:59,547
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

425
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:05,077
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

426
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:12,607
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

427
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:19,977
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

428
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:20,977
bad.

429
00:44:20,977 --> 00:44:28,817
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

430
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:36,107
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

431
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:40,117
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

432
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:48,587
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

433
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:55,107
dominating others, without showing off.

434
00:44:55,107 --> 00:45:03,117
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

435
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:12,237
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

436
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:21,187
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

437
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:29,767
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

438
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:31,247
and get it.

439
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:41,117
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

440
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:46,157
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

441
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:47,947
Nothing!

442
00:45:47,947 --> 00:46:01,327
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

443
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:10,967
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

444
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:17,547
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

445
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:23,837
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

446
00:46:23,837 --> 00:46:32,227
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

447
00:46:32,227 --> 00:46:33,787
That is not the idea.

448
00:46:33,787 --> 00:46:41,797
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

449
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:58,497
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

450
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:07,467
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

451
00:47:07,467 --> 00:47:18,626
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

452
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,197
realm of God.

453
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:23,107
That is what you are here for.

454
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:26,007
May God bless you.
