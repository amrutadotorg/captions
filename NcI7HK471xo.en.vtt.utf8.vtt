00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Evening program, Avignon, France, 07-07-1990

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:09.205
Give her a chair

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:16.455
 

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.455
 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.400
Give her a chair

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.020
otherwise she won't be able to play harmonium.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:43.995
 

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:45.315
 

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:06.395
 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.640
Ah,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.380
[Hindi]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.920
[Hindi]

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.520
Can you keep it up there? Ah. On that.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.560
[Hindi]

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.140
[Hindi]

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.480
[Hindi]

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.060
[Hindi]

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.580
You can move that.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040
 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080
 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.780
Come on. Have a sit there.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.520
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.560
We would like to present you a "Bharood" [Marathi religious song]

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.860
by Sant Eknath

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.060
It's a song that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.880
in a style that

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.680
is designed

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.680
to teach people

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.800
what will happen to them if they don't behave in a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.700
in the correct way

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.220
In this particular song

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580
Sant Eknath is talking about

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.800
 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.340
what happens to people if they're not, if they trick people

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.220
badly

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:21.955
if they are rude to them, if they cheat them.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.515
Sant Eknath gives example in particular

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.540
of Duryodhana

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.965
who took Draupadi and humiliated her in his court.

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:33.460
 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.480
and it was eventually

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.765
his brother, the brother of Duryodhana

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:42.075
drag Draupadi into the court to be humiliated.

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:45.415
And was eventually punished by Bhishma

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:51.045
punished by Bhishma in a dual.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.380
In the same way, Ravana who kidnapped Shri Sita

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.780
was duly punished by Shri Rama.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900
And so on in many cases.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.700
In reality, there are only four

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.800
people, that Sant Eknath mentions

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.340
who are free from any kind of

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.060
problem in his regard.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.980
For example, Bhishma

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.380
and

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:24.285
Hanumana, those two are examples.

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.835
Sant Eknath concludes the song

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.585
inviting us to be

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:35.880
sweet with each other and not to abuse each other.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.760
Otherwise - cause if we do,

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:39.275
then our fate

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:42.285
is a very ugly one.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.600
Give me a microphone for tablas.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.340
 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.720
When standing, they will wait.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.360
Yes.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.980
 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.760
So, all of you can sit there like this only.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160
Patrick!

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.800
Yes.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.340
 

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:32.725
 

00:06:33.155 --> 00:06:34.155
 

00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:36.865
 

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:47.575
 

00:06:47.575 --> 00:06:50.925
 

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:53.725
 

00:06:54.365 --> 00:06:57.565
 

00:06:57.835 --> 00:06:59.035
 

00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:01.885
 

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:03.135
 

00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:04.975
 

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.245
 

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:09.495
 

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:15.745
 

00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:41.085
 

00:07:42.205 --> 00:07:45.555
 

00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:53.975
 

00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:55.805
 

00:07:57.385 --> 00:07:58.455
 

00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:37.225
 

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.305
 

00:08:41.135 --> 00:08:43.645
 

00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:45.145
 

00:08:46.205 --> 00:08:47.205
 

00:08:48.265 --> 00:08:49.825
 

00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:54.265
 

00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:57.385
 

00:08:58.415 --> 00:08:59.415
 

00:09:00.135 --> 00:09:01.945
 

00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:28.025
 

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:29.875
 

00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:36.925
 

00:09:38.415 --> 00:09:41.355
 

00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:43.605
 

00:09:46.865 --> 00:09:47.865
 

00:09:49.345 --> 00:09:50.345
 

00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:52.645
 

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:17.505
 

00:10:17.505 --> 00:10:20.085
 

00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:23.405
 

00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:25.965
 

00:10:26.915 --> 00:10:29.305
 

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:33.625
 

00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:36.655
 

00:10:37.405 --> 00:10:39.315
 

00:10:40.475 --> 00:10:42.555
 

00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:44.695
 

00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:46.885
 

00:10:48.765 --> 00:10:49.765
 

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:24.325
 

00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:27.075
 

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:29.195
 

00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:33.135
 

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:36.465
 

00:11:37.365 --> 00:11:38.835
 

00:11:40.085 --> 00:11:41.905
 

00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:46.345
 

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:48.185
 

00:11:49.355 --> 00:11:50.355
 

00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:24.805
We have another

00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:27.525
song for you. This time it's a

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:29.455
village's song, a folk's song

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.200
from Uttar Pradesh.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.155
The context of the song is

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.080
a group of villagers on a way to a festival at Prayag

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.020
in the month of Magha which is January or February.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.520
 

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:51.060
And Prayag is a place where the two holy rivers of India, Ganga and Yamuna, meet.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.340
So, in the first verse, the villagers are singing the praises of Prayag

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.740
where the rivers meet,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.820
and for this reason, it's a holy place,

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.440
a place of pilgrimage.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.600
In the second verse, they explain how Ganga comes from Haridwar

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.060
which is also a place of pilgrimage because Ganga has come down from the heaven in that place.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.160
So it has come from Haridwar,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.460
which is a popular place of pilgrimage,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.520
to Prayag which is also a place of pilgrimage.

00:14:51.915 --> 00:14:52.915
 

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:53.975
 

00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:54.975
 

00:14:57.525 --> 00:14:59.125
 

00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:04.325
 

00:15:04.715 --> 00:15:05.715
 

00:15:08.185 --> 00:15:11.225
 

00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:12.155
 

00:15:12.155 --> 00:15:13.155
 

00:15:14.055 --> 00:15:15.465
 

00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:21.655
 

00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:28.985
 

00:15:36.025 --> 00:15:37.855
 

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.740
 

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.880
Come here, on the same line. You go a little bit that side.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.020
 

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:35.555
 

00:17:20.475 --> 00:17:21.475
 

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:27.745
 

00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:30.165
 

00:17:32.145 --> 00:17:33.145
 

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:19.365
 

00:19:53.815 --> 00:19:54.815
 

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.840
 

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.780
Ok, very good.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.980
 

00:20:43.025 --> 00:20:44.025
 

00:20:47.555 --> 00:20:48.555
 

00:20:48.555 --> 00:20:49.555
 

00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:50.985
 

00:20:54.385 --> 00:20:55.385
 

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.420
Ah! This reminded me of my own marriage when I went to my

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.840
husband's house.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.620
They all used to sing like this only there.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.300
So, it's wonderful, the way they have sung it, absolutely with  complete pronunciation,

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.720
everything, it's wonderful.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.460
I was just enjoying it. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have enjoyed too.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.380
 

00:21:56.975 --> 00:21:57.975
 

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:00.185
 

00:22:01.975 --> 00:22:04.485
 

00:22:12.025 --> 00:22:12.975
 

00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:13.975
 

00:22:21.315 --> 00:22:22.845
 

00:22:23.165 --> 00:22:24.165
 

00:22:25.815 --> 00:22:26.815
 

00:22:31.105 --> 00:22:32.105
 

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.620
 

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.560
The group of students who are sitting in front of you, on the stage,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.500
have been learning classical music

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.160
at Garlate house near Milano, I hope you - all of you know

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.220
Garlate house.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.100
And they covered about seven ragas.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.180
Among these ragas, they learnt Marva rag

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.000
which is the favorite raga of Shri Mataji.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:13.880
And they will sing what we call the chutta khayal [composition] in ektaal [12 beats].

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.920
First, they will sing the aroha [ascending scale]

00:23:18.265 --> 00:23:20.445
and pakad [melodic theme] of raga Marva

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.200
and then sargam [singing notes].

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.780
Aroha is ascend

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.200
Aroha is, are the ascending notes of the raga

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.920
And Avaroha are the descending notes of the raga.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.760
And pakad are the group of notes typical of that raga,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.660
so that the raga can be recognized when those notes are sung.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.440
And they are singing the chutta khayal in ektaal.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.720
And before singing the chutta khayal,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.720
they will sing sargam.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.340
Sargam, they will sing also in double rhythm.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.620
And chutta khayal, they will sing with alap and taans [first and second part of the raga].

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.700
I hope all of you will like it and Shri Mataji will also like what they sing in the present.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.880
 

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:24.385
 

00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:26.235
 

00:24:27.135 --> 00:24:28.135
 

00:24:38.235 --> 00:24:39.845
 

00:24:44.175 --> 00:24:45.175
 

00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:56.785
 

00:25:31.615 --> 00:25:32.615
 

00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:38.855
 

00:25:44.775 --> 00:25:45.775
 

00:25:47.525 --> 00:25:48.525
 

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.315
 

00:25:52.395 --> 00:25:53.975

Is a prayer composed by Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.220
in raga Bhairavi.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.240
"Antara Mama Bikoshito Karo, antara tara hey"

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:27.860
The devotee is praying to the God that: "Let my inner being be enlightened."

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.920
"Nirmala karo, ujjwala karo, sundara karo hey."

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.000
Nirmala, you know: Shri Mataji's name is Nirmala, pure.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.380
Absolutely pure.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.760
And "Mangalo karo" "make it holy and make it beautiful".

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.240
So, this prayer is being sung

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.545
by the students who were studying semi-classical

00:35:54.545 --> 00:35:57.635

00:41:40.805 --> 00:41:41.805
 

00:42:06.195 --> 00:42:07.285
 

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520
 

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.460
In a bus and

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.440
we had a lot of discomfort

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.420
in the sense that we were not feeling free.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.920
But when we came into this wonderful land of Italy,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:45.020
we were feeling very, very free and we were also feeling very hungry.

00:42:45.225 --> 00:42:46.225
 

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.100
Maybe, it has to do something with the Nabhi, I'm sure.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.020
But then, in order to keep my "Sangeet Sarita" members happy,

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.400
I was trying to sing a raga which is known as Chandrakauns.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.160
It's a very, very dynamic raga.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.600
And close to that raga is another raga known as Malkauns.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.800
And there is a difference of only one note in these two ragas.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:21.440
And, as I was singing I was talking to Guruji and I was saying

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.900
that if we add this note of one raga into another,

00:43:25.905 --> 00:43:28.675
I think we will create a beautiful raga.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:33.200
And he immediately got up and he started singing

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.360
with that additional note and a new raga was born.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.420
Just, just in the bus, a new raga was born.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.560
And then,

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:50.880
we had to give a name and Guruji gave a very, very dynamic very sahaj name:

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.480
he called it "Chaitanya Ranjani" [vibrations; to be rejoiced]

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.940
which will entertain your Chaitanya.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.240
This is a raga which is going to be played for the first time.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:08.160
Even in India, my sister will bear me out that this has not been played before, anywhere.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.940
So, you can imagine what's a headache is done to this poor Babamama

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.960
who knew very little about music.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.900
He's gone so dynamic that he is creating ragas!

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.300
 

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:33.060
This will be played to you by one and only Guruji on the violin

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.340
and our young artist Nasir khan.

00:44:39.785 --> 00:44:40.785
 

00:44:43.235 --> 00:44:44.235
 

00:44:48.045 --> 00:44:49.175
 

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.080
 

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.240
Guido, could you please take down completely ...

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.580
as it is obstructing the view.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.220
It has to be removed completely.

00:45:11.195 --> 00:45:12.195
 

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.580
 

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.340
I was discussing this raga with my

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.380
other sister; where is she? I can't see.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.660
She must be sitting on side.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.580
So, she was saying as to: "How could you create this raga?"

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.820
 

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:59.040
And she herself replied: "It is because of your concentration in music."

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.020
"That,

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:07.140
that is because you put your heart and soul in something and you will achieve."

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.900
So, when you have to have creativity,

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.200
your attention is the most important equipment.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.140
So, you put your attention on something and you are bound to create

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.140
if your attention is fully on that subject.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.280
Out of the twelve brothers and sisters that we are,

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.360
my dear sister is a subtle artist and was blessed with this voice and the gift of music

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.700
and we used to have music every day in the house.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.040
I was a very playful boy, but in between, I used to go and listen to this music.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.360
And that has been registered with me and it is coming so helpful now

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.200
so that we can transfer this culture of India through this music

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.355
to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.080
It's a tremendous feeling.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.780
Now, I will first tell you as to what the two ragas are

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.800
and then I will tell you how they have been blended.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.740
So you will be able to appreciate the difference.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.980
 

00:47:24.845 --> 00:47:25.845
 

00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:27.745
 

00:47:28.065 --> 00:47:29.065
 

00:47:31.695 --> 00:47:34.745
 

00:47:34.745 --> 00:47:37.665
 

00:47:37.665 --> 00:47:38.665
 

00:47:39.755 --> 00:47:40.755
 

00:47:42.945 --> 00:47:43.945
 

00:47:46.805 --> 00:47:47.805
 

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.680
 

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:58.560
First, a very brief introduction of the members of the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita who are on the stage:

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.300
Sandesh Popatkar on the tabla.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.220
Then,

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.280
Then our Guruji mister Prabhakarji [Dhakde] on the violin.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:38.000
And, two years ago this young artist Nasir Khan was here, he was then the baby

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.600
of the team.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.080
He has lost that status of being a baby because he's become,

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.700
he is going to become a father very shortly.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.980
And- but his sitar has improved immensely

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.480
over the two years.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:10.220
And now I will ask Prabhakarji to first play the ragas as they are.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.060
The two ragas.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.980
Now, first, he will play the Chandrakauns.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.680
 

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.600
One minute, the tuning.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.260
 

00:49:28.185 --> 00:49:29.185
 

00:49:33.655 --> 00:49:36.645
 

00:49:36.645 --> 00:49:37.645
 

00:49:39.515 --> 00:49:40.515
 

00:49:44.945 --> 00:49:45.945
 

00:49:50.005 --> 00:49:51.005
 

00:50:13.835 --> 00:50:15.155
 

00:50:20.165 --> 00:50:21.665
 

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.240
 

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.580
Now, this is Chandrakauns he is playing.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.040
 

00:50:41.055 --> 00:50:42.055
 

00:50:44.185 --> 00:50:46.025
 

00:50:49.835 --> 00:50:52.545
 

00:50:57.615 --> 00:50:58.615
 

00:50:59.445 --> 00:51:00.445
 

00:51:04.345 --> 00:51:05.345
 

00:51:17.685 --> 00:51:18.685
 

00:51:20.025 --> 00:51:21.025
 

00:51:21.175 --> 00:51:23.885
 

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760
 

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.800
Now, this is the original raga, Chandrakauns.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.200
Pakad notation [unsure]

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.935
 

00:51:39.935 --> 00:51:42.905
 

00:51:43.815 --> 00:51:44.815
 

00:51:45.605 --> 00:51:47.425
 

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.540
 

00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.200
Acha [Hindi]. Now, I'll ask Nasir to play Malkauns.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.040
See the notation.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.540
 

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.420
The only difference of one note.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.420
 

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:27.160
Now, the new raga. Only the notations.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:28.820
 

00:52:30.455 --> 00:52:32.045
 

00:52:33.585 --> 00:52:34.585
 

00:52:34.605 --> 00:52:36.405
 

00:52:39.545 --> 00:52:40.595
 

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320
 

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:05.300
OK. Now, the "Chaitanya Ranjani" for your Chaitanya. Thank you.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.780
 

00:53:11.585 --> 00:53:12.535
 

00:53:12.535 --> 00:53:13.535
 

00:53:19.745 --> 00:53:20.745
 

00:53:24.285 --> 00:53:25.845
 

00:53:27.575 --> 00:53:28.845
 

00:53:34.755 --> 00:53:35.755
 

00:53:36.565 --> 00:53:37.565
 

00:54:02.145 --> 00:54:03.145
 

00:54:07.405 --> 00:54:08.405
 

00:54:13.245 --> 00:54:14.245
 

00:54:37.175 --> 00:54:38.175
 

00:54:41.085 --> 00:54:42.085
 

00:54:54.895 --> 00:54:56.345
 

00:54:57.255 --> 00:54:58.255
 

00:55:03.665 --> 00:55:04.665
 

00:55:08.475 --> 00:55:09.475
 

00:55:10.915 --> 00:55:12.005
 

00:55:13.305 --> 00:55:14.305
 

00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:19.625
 

00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:23.125
 

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:25.555
 

00:55:25.715 --> 00:55:26.895
 

00:55:31.045 --> 00:55:32.045
 

00:55:32.385 --> 00:55:33.385
 

00:55:33.525 --> 00:55:34.745
 

00:55:35.455 --> 00:55:36.585
 

00:55:38.705 --> 00:55:39.705
 

00:55:39.915 --> 00:55:41.295
 

00:55:45.945 --> 00:55:46.945
 

00:55:47.235 --> 00:55:48.315
 

00:55:49.035 --> 00:55:50.155
 

00:55:52.405 --> 00:55:53.405
 

00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:55.875
 

00:55:57.155 --> 00:55:58.155
 

00:55:58.225 --> 00:55:59.515
 

00:56:06.525 --> 00:56:07.785
 

00:56:19.615 --> 00:56:20.615
 

00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:24.705
 

00:56:29.045 --> 00:56:32.325
 

00:56:32.465 --> 00:56:33.725
 

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:36.525
 

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.860
Antonio, people here can come here in the front.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.600
 

00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:47.460
 

00:56:48.585 --> 00:56:51.575
 

00:56:51.575 --> 00:56:52.575
 

00:56:55.325 --> 00:56:56.475
 

00:56:57.445 --> 00:56:58.445
 

00:57:07.295 --> 00:57:09.505
 

00:57:27.105 --> 00:57:28.105
 

00:58:09.135 --> 00:58:10.675
 

00:58:16.405 --> 00:58:17.545
 

00:58:21.885 --> 00:58:22.885
 

00:58:26.025 --> 00:58:27.555
 

00:58:28.685 --> 00:58:29.685
 

00:58:30.385 --> 00:58:31.385
 

00:58:32.305 --> 00:58:33.585
 

00:58:33.975 --> 00:58:34.975
 

00:58:37.725 --> 00:58:39.385
 

00:58:39.845 --> 00:58:40.845
 

00:58:43.355 --> 00:58:44.435
 

00:58:45.485 --> 00:58:46.485
 

00:58:46.915 --> 00:58:47.915
 

00:58:49.245 --> 00:58:50.535
 

00:58:51.355 --> 00:58:52.455
 

00:58:55.485 --> 00:58:56.485
 

00:59:02.075 --> 00:59:03.075
 

00:59:16.105 --> 00:59:17.105
 

00:59:36.095 --> 00:59:37.095
 

00:59:38.385 --> 00:59:39.385
 

00:59:42.835 --> 00:59:43.875
 

00:59:45.105 --> 00:59:46.105
 

00:59:48.395 --> 00:59:49.395
 

00:59:49.795 --> 00:59:50.795
 

01:00:01.805 --> 01:00:02.805
 

01:00:05.605 --> 01:00:06.795
 

01:00:09.335 --> 01:00:10.855
 

01:00:13.505 --> 01:00:14.685
 

01:00:17.055 --> 01:00:18.055
 

01:00:20.205 --> 01:00:21.205
 

01:00:24.075 --> 01:00:25.735
 

01:00:29.855 --> 01:00:30.855
 

01:00:32.675 --> 01:00:33.675
 

01:00:35.985 --> 01:00:36.985
 

01:00:37.235 --> 01:00:38.235
 

01:00:38.715 --> 01:00:41.255
 

01:00:44.825 --> 01:00:45.825
 

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:47.935
 

01:00:48.265 --> 01:00:49.265
 

01:00:49.715 --> 01:00:50.715
 

01:00:51.145 --> 01:00:52.385
 

01:00:53.065 --> 01:00:54.155
 

01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:55.675
 

01:00:56.885 --> 01:00:58.385
 

01:01:00.535 --> 01:01:03.315
 

01:01:03.315 --> 01:01:04.885
 

01:01:08.995 --> 01:01:09.995

01:20:56.575 --> 01:20:57.575
 

01:20:57.925 --> 01:20:58.925
 

01:21:11.265 --> 01:21:12.265
 

01:21:13.245 --> 01:21:14.885
 

01:21:15.465 --> 01:21:16.465
 

01:21:18.155 --> 01:21:21.165
 

01:21:21.755 --> 01:21:22.755
 

01:21:25.175 --> 01:21:28.395
 

01:21:29.025 --> 01:21:30.025
 

01:21:30.165 --> 01:21:31.165
 

01:21:31.455 --> 01:21:32.455
 

01:21:33.475 --> 01:21:35.025
 

01:21:39.525 --> 01:21:40.525
 

01:21:41.415 --> 01:21:43.065
 

01:21:43.895 --> 01:21:44.895
 

01:21:44.915 --> 01:21:45.915
 

01:21:46.645 --> 01:21:47.645
 

01:21:48.175 --> 01:21:49.175
 

01:21:49.885 --> 01:21:50.885
 

01:22:03.295 --> 01:22:04.295
 

01:22:22.465 --> 01:22:23.465
 

01:22:28.585 --> 01:22:29.585
 

01:22:37.135 --> 01:22:38.135
 

01:22:40.665 --> 01:22:41.665
 

01:22:58.645 --> 01:22:59.645
 

01:23:01.865 --> 01:23:02.865
 

01:23:04.425 --> 01:23:05.425
 

01:23:05.615 --> 01:23:06.615
 

01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:10.375
 

01:23:15.435 --> 01:23:16.435
 

01:23:17.685 --> 01:23:18.685
 

01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:24.375
 

01:23:26.315 --> 01:23:27.315
 

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:29.795
 

01:23:30.275 --> 01:23:31.995
 

01:23:32.695 --> 01:23:33.695
 

01:23:36.515 --> 01:23:37.515

01:23:52.095 --> 01:23:53.095
 

01:23:53.205 --> 01:23:54.205
 

01:23:56.255 --> 01:23:57.255
 

01:23:58.455 --> 01:24:00.255

01:25:03.195 --> 01:25:04.195
 

01:25:06.385 --> 01:25:07.385
 

01:25:14.185 --> 01:25:15.185
 

01:25:19.935 --> 01:25:20.935
 

01:25:26.715 --> 01:25:27.715
 

01:25:40.005 --> 01:25:41.005
 

01:25:53.445 --> 01:25:54.955
 

01:25:56.935 --> 01:25:58.105
 

01:25:58.895 --> 01:25:59.895
 

01:25:59.945 --> 01:26:00.945
 

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.415
 

01:26:04.945 --> 01:26:05.945
 

01:26:06.035 --> 01:26:07.525
 

01:26:08.555 --> 01:26:09.505
 

01:26:09.505 --> 01:26:11.975
 

01:26:12.405 --> 01:26:15.525
 

01:26:15.525 --> 01:26:18.725
 

01:26:19.155 --> 01:26:22.445
 

01:26:22.445 --> 01:26:25.655
 

01:26:25.655 --> 01:26:28.995
 

01:26:29.955 --> 01:26:30.955
 

01:26:31.605 --> 01:26:34.725
 

01:26:34.985 --> 01:26:35.985
 

01:26:36.635 --> 01:26:37.635
 

01:26:38.115 --> 01:26:39.655
 

01:26:50.525 --> 01:26:51.525
 

01:27:01.315 --> 01:27:02.315
 

01:27:03.045 --> 01:27:04.045
 

01:27:23.865 --> 01:27:24.865
 

01:27:28.505 --> 01:27:29.505
 

01:27:37.765 --> 01:27:38.765
 

01:27:54.395 --> 01:27:55.395
 

01:28:04.295 --> 01:28:05.795
 

01:28:17.495 --> 01:28:18.675
 

01:28:19.115 --> 01:28:20.115
 

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:22.755
 

01:28:23.015 --> 01:28:24.015
 

01:28:46.545 --> 01:28:47.695
 

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:49.625
 

01:28:50.815 --> 01:28:51.815
 

01:28:53.575 --> 01:28:54.575
 

01:28:55.165 --> 01:28:56.165
 

01:28:57.755 --> 01:28:58.755
 

01:29:00.755 --> 01:29:01.755
 

01:29:03.955 --> 01:29:04.955
 

01:29:09.245 --> 01:29:10.245
 

01:29:10.495 --> 01:29:11.435
 

01:29:11.435 --> 01:29:12.435
 

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:24.775
 

01:29:25.595 --> 01:29:26.595
 

01:29:27.385 --> 01:29:28.385
 

01:29:30.165 --> 01:29:31.235
 

01:29:32.755 --> 01:29:33.755
 

01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:35.335
 

01:29:36.435 --> 01:29:37.435
 

01:29:41.565 --> 01:29:42.815
 

01:29:43.985 --> 01:29:44.985
 

01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:49.875
 

01:29:51.725 --> 01:29:52.705
 

01:29:52.705 --> 01:29:53.705
 

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:35.195
 

01:30:41.105 --> 01:30:42.105
 

01:30:42.975 --> 01:30:43.975
 

01:30:45.445 --> 01:30:46.445
 

01:30:55.735 --> 01:30:58.055
 

01:30:58.715 --> 01:30:59.755
 

01:31:00.095 --> 01:31:00.965
 

01:31:00.965 --> 01:31:03.355
 

01:31:19.595 --> 01:31:20.595
 

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.120
 

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:03.460
Shri Mataji has suggested

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.360
a new name for this raga.

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:10.320
Since this is a gift from the disciple to the guru,

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:15.800
and guru is synonymous of Purnima that is the full Moon,

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:19.960
Shri Mataji says that this raga should be called

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.820
"Chaitanya Purnima", that means-

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.280
I think this is the biggest award

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.035
a disciple can expect from a guru

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.940
that She has blessed this raga with a very wonderful name.

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.480
Jai Shri Mataji.

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:11.140
 

01:34:14.375 --> 01:34:15.375
 

01:34:45.145 --> 01:34:46.145
 

01:34:47.555 --> 01:34:48.555
 

01:35:08.945 --> 01:35:09.945
 

01:35:12.865 --> 01:35:13.865
 

01:35:26.025 --> 01:35:27.025
 

01:35:34.235 --> 01:35:35.575
 

01:35:37.295 --> 01:35:38.295
 

01:35:39.325 --> 01:35:40.325
 

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:41.735
 

01:35:42.735 --> 01:35:43.695
 

01:35:43.695 --> 01:35:44.695
 

01:35:52.985 --> 01:35:55.015
 

01:35:58.745 --> 01:35:59.875
 

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.725
 

01:36:11.245 --> 01:36:14.705
 

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:18.900
 

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.780
You are lucky because Shri Mataji is speaking about you.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.180
All of you.

01:36:33.545 --> 01:36:36.225
 

01:36:45.385 --> 01:36:46.665
 

01:36:50.985 --> 01:36:51.985
 

01:36:55.325 --> 01:36:56.325
 

01:36:58.255 --> 01:36:59.255
 

01:37:00.605 --> 01:37:01.605
 

01:37:02.145 --> 01:37:04.465
 

01:37:04.505 --> 01:37:05.785
 

01:37:06.295 --> 01:37:07.945
 

01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:11.585
 

01:37:11.695 --> 01:37:13.045
 

01:37:13.635 --> 01:37:16.595
 

01:37:16.595 --> 01:37:18.905
 

01:37:18.905 --> 01:37:21.845
 

01:37:21.845 --> 01:37:24.615
 

01:37:24.615 --> 01:37:25.615
 

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:30.345
 

01:37:42.635 --> 01:37:43.635
 

01:37:45.195 --> 01:37:46.195
 

01:37:46.585 --> 01:37:47.585
 

01:37:56.625 --> 01:37:58.045
 

01:38:00.015 --> 01:38:01.015
 

01:38:07.135 --> 01:38:08.135
 

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:10.205
 

01:38:15.565 --> 01:38:16.605
 

01:38:18.015 --> 01:38:19.015
 

01:38:19.505 --> 01:38:20.505
 

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:29.175
 

01:38:29.575 --> 01:38:30.575
 

01:38:31.175 --> 01:38:32.175
 

01:38:34.265 --> 01:38:35.265
 

01:38:36.925 --> 01:38:37.925
 

01:38:44.535 --> 01:38:45.535
 

01:38:47.145 --> 01:38:48.755
 

01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:53.260
 

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:00.200
Chers amis, [Dear friends,]

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.180
bonsoir. [good night.]

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.560
Thank you.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.560
[No sound.]

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.840
Because I wanted to drive in Rome, I wanted to drive, so I said:

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.860
"We will take the car."

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.860
So we took the car

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:34.640
and as you know that it's very difficult to find parking in Rome,

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.180
like in Paris, yes.

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.260
More difficult.

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:45.980
So, for about twenty minutes,

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.200
we went around, around and around

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.940
looking for a parking place.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.120
Twenty minutes later, I suddenly noticed

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.480
a small gap in front of the restaurant.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.380
I took my car and I went into this gap.

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.520
And in front,

01:41:15.595 --> 01:41:19.055
there was a poster of Shri Mataji smiling.

01:41:36.345 --> 01:41:37.345
 

01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:39.900
 

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:44.840
The smile on that poster was very knowing.

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:51.480
I'm very-

01:41:53.455 --> 01:41:56.915
I'm very touched and very moved

01:41:57.195 --> 01:41:58.875
that

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.560
we have been chosen as one of the musicians

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.660
to play in this

01:42:09.235 --> 01:42:11.215
elated evening.

01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:15.600
 

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.500
Indian classical music is based on ragas,

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.180
melodies which we call ragas,

01:42:27.185 --> 01:42:30.025
and ragas are emotions,

01:42:30.485 --> 01:42:33.945
ragas are mood, it's an emotion.

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:38.600
And different ragas have different emotions.

01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.720
And this evening, I chose to play a raga

01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:48.840
called Puriya, raga Puriya.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.840
[No sound.]

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.240
 

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.360
Tomorrow is, as you know, we are going to celebrate the Guru Purnima.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.100
And all these artists, whom you see here,

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.840
have become such great artists

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:41.240
because of their dedication - of course through the art- but through their gurus.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.860
Complete dedication.

01:43:43.255 --> 01:43:46.695
And this is the key of their success:

01:43:47.145 --> 01:43:50.465
complete dedication to the guru.

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.140
And to master any art,

01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:59.220
you have to have dedication and surrendering.

01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:05.280
And that's how these people have achieved such heights of perfection.

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.940
That they have followed their gurus

01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.480
out and out absolutely, completely surrendering.

01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:17.380
And that is why today I'm happy that we have so many artists here, especially

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.840
such a great artist

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.220
of such fame before you.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.540
But if you ask him, he 'll tell you that

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.900
he had to go through penance

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.560
to master this art.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:34.100
And his own father is his guru.

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:38.380
So what a difficult situation must be for the father or for the son.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.495
But as far as the art is concerned,

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.240
there is no compromise.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.760
In the same way, as fas as spirituality is concerned,

01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:49.080
there is no compromise.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.980
Maybe, your guru is your Mother, but still,

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.360
no compromise.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.300
So, may God bless you.

03:29:41.295 --> 03:29:42.295
 

03:29:44.405 --> 03:29:45.405

03:30:21.545 --> 03:30:22.805
 

03:30:24.745 --> 03:30:26.375
 

03:30:28.495 --> 03:30:29.495
 

03:30:38.565 --> 03:30:39.565
 

03:30:45.935 --> 03:30:46.935
 

03:30:57.945 --> 03:30:58.945
 

03:31:08.880 --> 03:31:09.880
 

03:33:25.440 --> 03:33:28.780
Thank you very much for appreciating him so much.

03:33:28.780 --> 03:33:30.875
Actually,

03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:32.080
 

03:33:32.980 --> 03:33:36.200
it is a tremendous speed, you see

03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:38.715
the speed with which and the balance.

03:33:38.715 --> 03:33:41.435
Balance and the speed.

03:33:41.440 --> 03:33:45.400
We are living in an age of, we are living in an age of a jet, you see,

03:33:45.500 --> 03:33:47.960
we're living in an age of speed

03:33:48.040 --> 03:33:52.300
and in that speed, we have to keep the balance and the rhythm.

03:33:52.780 --> 03:33:55.215
That's what you have to learn

03:33:55.220 --> 03:33:59.640
is to keep the balance and the rhythm and then you have to come to the first beat,

03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:01.800
that is the Spirit.

03:34:02.220 --> 03:34:07.040
So, how you are bound, may go anywhere with any speed,

03:34:07.820 --> 03:34:10.120
keep the speed, keep the balance

03:34:10.240 --> 03:34:13.020
and come back to the same

03:34:13.340 --> 03:34:17.800
first beat which is the Spirit,

03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:20.000
is the- that's how it works out.

03:34:22.180 --> 03:34:25.660
And the speed with which he is playing, I tell you, this is a

03:34:27.540 --> 03:34:30.660
very great, modern also, a kind of a blessing

03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:33.280
that there is a speed in the atmosphere.

03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:36.115
And everywhere there's speed and -

03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:39.520
but in that speed to have the balance is only possible

03:34:40.140 --> 03:34:40.960
when

03:34:41.445 --> 03:34:44.055
you practice what you call "riyaz"

03:34:44.055 --> 03:34:47.185
is quite deep and you do it with your

03:34:47.315 --> 03:34:49.815
whole attention and whole heart.

03:34:49.820 --> 03:34:50.840
Then only,

03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:54.120
otherwise it's not possible such a speed that he has.

03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:57.695
What a tremendous speed! [Hindi]

03:34:57.700 --> 03:35:00.380
 

03:35:00.820 --> 03:35:05.380
Speed [inaudible] - you see,  have you noticed the speed with which he was playing?

03:35:05.380 --> 03:35:07.380
And have you noticed the balance that he had?

03:35:07.385 --> 03:35:09.280
And how he was rhythmic?

03:35:09.395 --> 03:35:12.135
Rhythm, he never missed, you see, he's very  good

03:35:12.220 --> 03:35:15.340
as we call it the [inaudible]

03:35:15.640 --> 03:35:18.100
like.

03:35:18.260 --> 03:35:19.840
 

03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:22.400
So he is, tablavala is another -

03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:23.340
Tablavala is very sahaj Mother.

03:35:23.340 --> 03:35:24.120
Sahaj!

03:35:24.120 --> 03:35:25.800
And he is absolutely relaxed

03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:27.860
and he is playing so well. He's beautiful.

03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:33.100
And that is what kind of a tablavala you need for a music like this

03:35:33.100 --> 03:35:33.620
where

03:35:33.780 --> 03:35:37.100
he has to be most unassuming and he is supporting

03:35:37.100 --> 03:35:39.920
all the time the artist, should be the point.

03:35:40.615 --> 03:35:43.945
I'm very happy you all are enjoying it so much

03:35:43.985 --> 03:35:47.105
and that you are appreciative of it

03:35:47.185 --> 03:35:49.145
cause, after all, it's a -

03:35:49.145 --> 03:35:52.365
we have been brought up in this kind of [inaudible] style.

03:35:52.365 --> 03:35:56.560
In my family, from my childhood, I have been earing nothing but classical music

03:35:56.560 --> 03:35:59.120
and all my life.

03:35:59.120 --> 03:36:01.500
I've never known even one minute in my house

03:36:01.500 --> 03:36:03.380
then where the music is not there:

03:36:03.380 --> 03:36:06.140
somebody singing in this room or somebody singing in that room,

03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:08.940
whatever may be the situation, there is music on.

03:36:09.100 --> 03:36:13.740
So, for my ear it is tremendous but to my heart also.

03:36:13.740 --> 03:36:17.500
And the way he has played, I must thank him very much on your behalf.

03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:20.860
From his heart, he has played, from his heart.

03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:24.820
It's only to her presence that this can happen.

03:36:25.100 --> 03:36:26.820
You all know this also.

03:36:41.975 --> 03:36:43.225
 

03:36:43.935 --> 03:36:46.975
 

03:36:47.645 --> 03:36:49.615
 

03:37:51.985 --> 03:37:53.355
 

03:37:55.825 --> 03:37:56.825
 

03:37:59.695 --> 03:38:02.075
 

03:38:06.805 --> 03:38:07.805
 

03:38:08.685 --> 03:38:09.685
 

03:38:11.325 --> 03:38:12.325
 

03:38:23.655 --> 03:38:25.735
 

03:39:00.985 --> 03:39:01.985
 

03:39:12.685 --> 03:39:13.685
 

03:39:14.625 --> 03:39:15.625
 

03:39:17.305 --> 03:39:18.305
 

03:39:21.660 --> 03:39:26.900
"Avion" [plane] means "air" isn't it? "Wind" in French.

03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:30.060
"Avion" is wind.

03:39:30.060 --> 03:39:32.920
He says it is "guide" "avion" is "guide"

03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:34.920
No, "avion", "avion".

03:39:35.060 --> 03:39:35.840
"Avion"?

03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:36.940
Is what?

03:39:36.940 --> 03:39:38.060
"Avion" is airplane.

03:39:38.060 --> 03:39:42.180
Airplane. There's a lot of "avion" in the Avignon.

03:39:44.680 --> 03:39:46.560
 

03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:31.680
If you see, the sitar he has got

03:40:31.680 --> 03:40:33.660
a rakhi to it, you see?

03:40:33.815 --> 03:40:36.235
You all know what is rakhi is.

03:40:36.235 --> 03:40:38.985
So the sitar is his sister.

03:40:39.240 --> 03:40:43.440
And the sisterly love is the purity of love,

03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:45.320
absolute, pure love, you see.

03:40:45.320 --> 03:40:47.820
And the sister is the protector of the brother.

03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:51.880
So, this is how they tie rakhi to a sister, you see?

03:40:52.500 --> 03:40:54.540
I hope you have noticed it.

03:40:54.540 --> 03:40:56.540
[Hindi]

03:40:56.600 --> 03:40:59.320
 

03:40:59.745 --> 03:41:01.765
 

03:41:02.085 --> 03:41:03.195
 

03:41:03.615 --> 03:41:05.295
 

03:41:05.635 --> 03:41:07.535
 

03:41:07.945 --> 03:41:09.505
 

03:41:10.305 --> 03:41:11.305
 

03:41:21.775 --> 03:41:22.775
 

03:41:31.495 --> 03:41:32.495
 

03:41:33.855 --> 03:41:34.855
 

03:41:39.635 --> 03:41:40.635
 

03:41:42.975 --> 03:41:43.975
 

03:41:45.425 --> 03:41:46.425
 

03:41:49.465 --> 03:41:50.465
 

03:42:02.345 --> 03:42:03.345
 

03:42:04.175 --> 03:42:05.175
 

03:42:12.575 --> 03:42:14.035
 

03:42:16.555 --> 03:42:17.605
 

03:42:18.705 --> 03:42:19.705
 

03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:23.240
 

03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:35.720
There is a circus on

03:42:35.900 --> 03:42:39.760
and it's a nice contrast to see the difference between the two.

03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:50.940
 

03:42:56.980 --> 03:42:57.980
 

03:43:21.880 --> 03:43:24.575
This is the raga which is called as Durga

03:43:24.575 --> 03:43:26.955
as you must have heard it before also

03:43:27.020 --> 03:43:29.140
and it's quite a difficult raga and

03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:34.120
also it is only with the five notes it is played

03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:36.280
and there are very few ragas like that.

03:43:36.875 --> 03:43:40.335
And one of them is Gunakali raga.

03:43:40.615 --> 03:43:43.315
which is also played with the same style.

03:43:43.415 --> 03:43:45.465
And I was surprised that

03:43:45.465 --> 03:43:47.915
in certain countries,

03:43:47.920 --> 03:43:50.980
they only know one raga.

03:43:50.980 --> 03:43:55.600
Like Bhairava, it's a - it's the only raga they know in Iran.

03:43:55.700 --> 03:43:58.375
Whether it is morning, evening, afternoon,

03:43:58.375 --> 03:44:01.575
they sing just that one raga is Bhairava.

03:44:01.580 --> 03:44:04.780
And I was surprised, I heard Gunakali in Japan.

03:44:04.820 --> 03:44:05.380
Ah, ah.

03:44:05.380 --> 03:44:09.100
Japanse have only idea of Gunakali, I don't know how they got it.

03:44:09.440 --> 03:44:11.640
But only Gunakali nothing else.

03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:12.360
Absolutely.

03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:15.600
Absolutely. That's all. One raga they are masters.

03:44:15.760 --> 03:44:16.560
They are mastering that raga.

03:44:16.680 --> 03:44:19.320
One, but morning, evening, [Hindi]

03:44:19.320 --> 03:44:20.140
 

03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:24.740
And in a way, these ragas are morning ragas.  [Hindi]

03:44:25.700 --> 03:44:28.940
Bhairava especially is a raga

03:44:29.100 --> 03:44:32.600
all the time they sing without any discrimination.

03:44:34.860 --> 03:44:37.520
But this is the time for Durga really.

03:44:38.885 --> 03:44:40.535
Just before awakening,

03:44:41.160 --> 03:44:45.960
the mother is calling that: "Get up now and meditate."

03:44:50.580 --> 03:44:51.700
Ah!

03:44:52.180 --> 03:44:54.800
How beautiful it is, just see.

03:45:01.300 --> 03:45:02.300
 

03:45:41.055 --> 03:45:42.055
 

03:45:42.775 --> 03:45:43.775
 

03:45:55.065 --> 03:45:56.065
 

03:46:02.215 --> 03:46:03.215
 

03:46:39.645 --> 03:46:41.085
 

03:46:45.425 --> 03:46:46.425
 

03:46:50.695 --> 03:46:51.695
 

03:46:53.055 --> 03:46:54.055
 

03:47:09.695 --> 03:47:10.695
 

03:47:11.405 --> 03:47:12.405
 

03:47:13.585 --> 03:47:14.585
 

03:47:19.765 --> 03:47:20.765
 

03:47:50.375 --> 03:47:51.375
 

03:48:06.215 --> 03:48:07.215
 

03:48:09.095 --> 03:48:10.095
 

03:48:12.805 --> 03:48:13.805
 

03:48:14.125 --> 03:48:15.125
 

03:48:17.405 --> 03:48:18.405
 

03:48:25.855 --> 03:48:26.855
 

03:48:28.965 --> 03:48:29.965
 

03:48:54.585 --> 03:48:55.585
 

03:49:02.575 --> 03:49:03.575
 

03:49:03.615 --> 03:49:05.365
 

03:49:06.105 --> 03:49:08.555
 

03:49:18.515 --> 03:49:19.515
 

03:49:32.135 --> 03:49:33.135
 

03:49:45.625 --> 03:49:46.625
 

03:49:49.985 --> 03:49:50.985
 

03:50:00.225 --> 03:50:01.225
 

03:50:06.075 --> 03:50:07.075
 

03:50:07.285 --> 03:50:08.375
 

03:50:08.745 --> 03:50:09.945
 

03:50:11.175 --> 03:50:12.175
 

03:50:12.835 --> 03:50:13.835
 

03:50:32.485 --> 03:50:33.635
 

03:50:39.815 --> 03:50:40.815
 

03:50:48.305 --> 03:50:49.305
 

03:50:49.765 --> 03:50:50.765
 

03:51:07.715 --> 03:51:08.715
 

03:51:14.745 --> 03:51:15.745
 

03:51:40.465 --> 03:51:43.515
 

03:51:43.515 --> 03:51:46.965
 

03:51:47.615 --> 03:51:48.615
 

03:51:49.325 --> 03:51:52.215
 

03:51:52.215 --> 03:51:54.815
 

03:51:54.815 --> 03:51:57.815
 

03:51:57.815 --> 03:51:58.975
 

03:51:59.855 --> 03:52:00.855
 

03:52:01.185 --> 03:52:02.185
 

03:52:04.115 --> 03:52:07.505
 

03:52:07.665 --> 03:52:10.245
 

03:52:10.375 --> 03:52:13.085
 

03:52:13.085 --> 03:52:14.085
 

03:52:14.345 --> 03:52:15.475
 

03:52:15.955 --> 03:52:19.065
 

03:52:19.065 --> 03:52:20.065
 

03:52:20.245 --> 03:52:22.385
 

03:52:23.065 --> 03:52:24.065
 

03:52:59.895 --> 03:53:00.895
 

03:53:01.415 --> 03:53:02.415
 

03:53:02.855 --> 03:53:03.855
 

03:53:29.505 --> 03:53:30.505
 

03:53:34.495 --> 03:53:35.495
 

03:53:43.205 --> 03:53:44.205
 

03:53:54.755 --> 03:53:55.755
 

03:54:02.105 --> 03:54:03.105
 

03:54:09.595 --> 03:54:10.595
 

03:54:14.155 --> 03:54:15.155
 

03:54:16.255 --> 03:54:17.775
 

03:54:18.995 --> 03:54:19.995
 

03:54:21.165 --> 03:54:22.165
 

03:54:22.925 --> 03:54:23.925
 

03:54:28.745 --> 03:54:29.745
 

03:54:32.975 --> 03:54:34.155
 

03:54:35.435 --> 03:54:36.925
 

03:54:37.725 --> 03:54:39.085
 

03:54:39.975 --> 03:54:41.725
 

03:54:42.635 --> 03:54:43.635
 

03:54:44.425 --> 03:54:45.425
 

03:54:52.355 --> 03:54:53.355
 

03:54:55.345 --> 03:54:56.345
 

03:55:04.635 --> 03:55:05.805
 

03:55:06.945 --> 03:55:07.945
 

03:55:36.255 --> 03:55:37.255
 

03:55:37.605 --> 03:55:38.605
 

03:55:43.045 --> 03:55:44.045
 

03:56:05.345 --> 03:56:06.345
 

03:56:07.595 --> 03:56:08.595
 

03:56:12.125 --> 03:56:13.125
 

03:56:32.425 --> 03:56:33.425
 

03:56:34.125 --> 03:56:35.845
 

03:56:41.585 --> 03:56:42.585
 

03:56:42.705 --> 03:56:43.705
 

03:57:06.965 --> 03:57:08.135
 

03:57:09.805 --> 03:57:10.805
 

03:57:21.705 --> 03:57:22.705
 

03:57:28.775 --> 03:57:29.775
 

03:57:42.755 --> 03:57:43.755
 

03:57:45.795 --> 03:57:46.795
 

03:57:57.805 --> 03:57:58.805
 

03:58:01.115 --> 03:58:02.115
 

03:58:02.195 --> 03:58:03.195
 

03:58:14.145 --> 03:58:15.145
 

03:58:24.055 --> 03:58:25.055
 

03:58:25.905 --> 03:58:26.905
 

03:58:27.725 --> 03:58:28.675
 

03:58:28.675 --> 03:58:29.675
 

03:58:40.005 --> 03:58:41.005
 

03:58:45.835 --> 03:58:46.835
 

03:59:08.945 --> 03:59:09.945
 

03:59:26.545 --> 03:59:27.795
 

03:59:30.315 --> 03:59:31.315
 

03:59:39.235 --> 03:59:40.235
 

03:59:41.105 --> 03:59:42.105
 

03:59:47.880 --> 03:59:48.880
 

04:04:27.500 --> 04:04:28.820
 

04:25:43.500 --> 04:25:47.920
Now, their last raga is Bhairavi.

04:25:47.920 --> 04:25:49.920
It has to be played in the old

04:25:49.920 --> 04:25:51.920
traditional ways and

04:25:51.920 --> 04:25:56.760
it's a raga that is in praise of the power of,

04:25:59.260 --> 04:26:01.080
we can say,

04:26:01.480 --> 04:26:02.920
of the Spirit.

04:26:02.920 --> 04:26:08.960
Because it is a- it has such beautiful notes and

04:26:08.960 --> 04:26:10.960
[Hindi].

04:26:12.580 --> 04:26:17.100
Notes which are - it's a complete "sampurna"

04:26:17.100 --> 04:26:19.100
it's a complete "aga" it's a "Purnima". Hey?

04:26:19.100 --> 04:26:20.260
[Babamama in Hindi]

04:26:20.260 --> 04:26:23.700
All the twelves notes are in it. So, you see,

04:26:23.700 --> 04:26:29.120
it's such a complete raga and it has to be played in all due respect to it.

04:26:29.120 --> 04:26:31.120
And it is a ragani Shri Mataji.

04:26:31.120 --> 04:26:33.480
It's a ragani regarded as you see, because

04:26:33.600 --> 04:26:35.120
 

04:26:35.620 --> 04:26:40.040
Now, as you know that the heart chakra has got -

04:26:40.040 --> 04:26:43.300
heart chakra has got twelve petals.

04:26:44.440 --> 04:26:46.440
And the Durga resides on the heart chakra.

04:26:47.960 --> 04:26:53.420
Now, the Durga's qualities are that she is protective of her children.

04:26:54.300 --> 04:26:57.420
She's very gentle, very soft with her children.

04:26:57.980 --> 04:27:05.660
And she is extremely horrifying to the crooks, to the satanic people, to the negative people.

04:27:05.660 --> 04:27:09.180
So, in this raga, I think because the-

04:27:09.460 --> 04:27:11.360
there are - it's spaced out,

04:27:11.660 --> 04:27:15.360
the notes are spaced out.

04:27:15.360 --> 04:27:18.580
So, either you could play it slow or you could play it fast.

04:27:18.580 --> 04:27:19.900
Nothing in between.

04:27:20.100 --> 04:27:22.640
That's why it is on a Durga style, you see.

04:27:22.640 --> 04:27:25.300
Either she's extremely gentle

04:27:25.300 --> 04:27:27.600
or she is extremely horrifying.

04:27:28.320 --> 04:27:32.440
So, because she has a double function, is one is to look after her children

04:27:32.440 --> 04:27:37.640
and another is: protect her children from the devils.

04:27:37.640 --> 04:27:40.240
So she has to be very quick about it

04:27:40.240 --> 04:27:45.220
to fight them and to, in every way, to frighten them

04:27:45.540 --> 04:27:47.600
and to be alert about them.

04:27:48.180 --> 04:27:51.060
So, in the second part, you all became very alert I saw it.

04:27:51.140 --> 04:27:53.320
The first part, you were having a lullaby

04:27:53.460 --> 04:27:57.040
because it was the mother's love that was playing.

04:27:57.300 --> 04:27:58.920
But the second part, you became alert

04:27:58.920 --> 04:28:00.920
because she has to fight.

04:28:01.380 --> 04:28:06.260
Now, this is such a nice raga

04:28:06.260 --> 04:28:10.920
because it gives you a better sense of security

04:28:10.920 --> 04:28:12.180
within yourselves.

04:28:12.520 --> 04:28:14.920
Will give you a sense of security.

04:28:14.920 --> 04:28:19.240
And also as you know, medically that it's important to build up this chakra

04:28:19.720 --> 04:28:22.960
because that gives you antibodies created more

04:28:23.240 --> 04:28:26.400
so to fight all the diseases, to fight all the foreign things

04:28:26.400 --> 04:28:28.400
which try to attack us.

04:28:28.400 --> 04:28:31.420
So, this raga is so apt, absolutely apt

04:28:31.420 --> 04:28:37.420
for today's atmosphere and for today's need,

04:28:37.420 --> 04:28:41.680
that we have to have the security of the Mother and the protection of the Mother.

04:28:42.220 --> 04:28:45.400
And that all the evil forces must be finished from this world.

04:28:45.400 --> 04:28:48.720
And that's how this raga has a very great significance

04:28:48.800 --> 04:28:52.480
and I thank you very much for feeling this raga,

04:28:52.480 --> 04:28:53.340
see.

04:29:02.200 --> 04:29:05.860
This is the now last five minutes he would like to play,

04:29:05.860 --> 04:29:07.860
he asked the Bhairavi

04:29:09.520 --> 04:29:13.360
which is a complete raga as you can call, is the complete Purnima.

04:29:13.660 --> 04:29:17.420
All the - all the notes are there.

04:29:18.000 --> 04:29:23.480
And it is played in various ways, is in various styles and

04:29:24.060 --> 04:29:28.860
is used for so many expressions of

04:29:29.240 --> 04:29:31.660
your feelings and things.

04:29:32.300 --> 04:29:36.940
But in this also, there's a beautiful one of a song as you know

04:29:37.420 --> 04:29:39.420
Dayani Bhavani is the one

04:29:40.160 --> 04:29:43.520
which is a song about the Mother Goddess.

04:29:44.300 --> 04:29:48.860
And in this [inaudible] there's a little mixture in the-

04:29:49.140 --> 04:29:50.300
I don't know if it is an

04:29:50.300 --> 04:29:51.800
absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

04:29:51.800 --> 04:29:53.800
 

04:29:53.900 --> 04:29:55.840
[Hindi]

04:29:55.840 --> 04:29:58.880
It is to be played absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi.

04:29:58.880 --> 04:30:00.880
[Hindi]

04:30:01.740 --> 04:30:03.940
 

04:30:03.940 --> 04:30:05.940
 

04:30:10.880 --> 04:30:13.960
It should be played in absolute Shuddha Bhairavi.

04:30:13.960 --> 04:30:15.960
[Hindi]

04:30:15.960 --> 04:30:17.960
 

04:30:17.960 --> 04:30:19.960
 

04:30:19.960 --> 04:30:21.960
 

04:30:21.960 --> 04:30:23.960
 

04:30:28.300 --> 04:30:30.300
It is to be played absolutely in pure Bhairavi.

04:30:30.300 --> 04:30:31.740
This is the best way

04:30:31.840 --> 04:30:34.300
because Bhairavi is the name of the Goddess.

04:30:34.700 --> 04:30:35.980
So, that will be the-

04:30:35.980 --> 04:30:37.940
 

04:30:37.940 --> 04:30:40.300
[Hindi]

04:30:40.700 --> 04:30:45.080
So, this is the purity of it, purity of it creates that

04:30:45.880 --> 04:30:48.100
feeling and that-

04:30:49.380 --> 04:30:54.400
I mean it awakens that Deity so that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

04:30:55.460 --> 04:30:58.420
 

04:30:58.420 --> 04:31:00.420
 

04:31:00.420 --> 04:31:02.420
 

04:31:02.420 --> 04:31:04.420
 

04:31:08.320 --> 04:31:10.320
 

04:31:10.320 --> 04:31:12.320
 

04:31:15.260 --> 04:31:21.720
Ah! She, my sister is accepting that they may make some mistakes in the Shuddhata [unsure].

04:31:22.040 --> 04:31:24.040
 

04:31:24.040 --> 04:31:26.040
 

04:31:27.800 --> 04:31:29.800
 

04:31:32.520 --> 04:31:36.400
Which I detected, you see, I'm not such a musician as you are,

04:31:36.400 --> 04:31:40.300
but I did detect that there's a little bit [inaudible]

04:31:43.920 --> 04:31:45.920
 

04:31:45.920 --> 04:31:47.920
 

04:31:47.920 --> 04:31:49.920
 

04:31:49.920 --> 04:31:51.920
 

04:31:52.580 --> 04:31:54.580
 

04:31:54.580 --> 04:31:56.580
 

04:31:56.580 --> 04:31:58.580
 

04:31:58.580 --> 04:32:00.580
 

04:32:00.580 --> 04:32:02.100
 

04:32:02.140 --> 04:32:06.400
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, I mean, such a lot of freedom.

04:32:06.660 --> 04:32:08.920
Ah! You can do what you like with it but

04:32:08.920 --> 04:32:12.100
only thing that you have to keep to the ragas

04:32:12.200 --> 04:32:16.780
and you have to keep to the "swaras" [notes] and everything and

04:32:17.420 --> 04:32:21.660
it cannot just go crazy from one to another like that.

04:32:22.040 --> 04:32:25.080
So, it is like a big aeroplane which is going in the air

04:32:25.080 --> 04:32:29.400
with everything completely fixed properly, you see, so it can go anywhere.

04:32:29.940 --> 04:32:33.400
Unless and until you it's fixed by its own maryadas, it cannot go.

04:32:33.980 --> 04:32:37.120
So, that has to be there. So first, the ragas are built.

04:32:37.180 --> 04:32:40.000
And built in such a way that they are absolutely perfect.

04:32:40.040 --> 04:32:42.920
And then you can go wherever you feel like, nothing will happen.

04:32:44.020 --> 04:32:45.600
[Hindi]

04:32:47.520 --> 04:32:49.520
 

04:32:50.600 --> 04:32:52.600
 

04:32:52.600 --> 04:32:56.860
 

04:32:57.000 --> 04:33:01.940
 

04:33:01.940 --> 04:33:07.420
 

04:33:07.420 --> 04:33:12.660
 

04:33:12.660 --> 04:33:16.080
 

04:33:16.080 --> 04:33:18.080
 

04:33:18.080 --> 04:33:20.080
 

04:33:20.080 --> 04:33:24.180
 

04:33:24.180 --> 04:33:28.480
 

04:33:28.480 --> 04:33:33.400
 

04:33:33.400 --> 04:33:35.400
 

04:33:35.400 --> 04:33:37.400
 

04:33:37.400 --> 04:33:39.400
 

04:33:39.420 --> 04:33:41.480
Then it will become jazz Shri Mataji.

04:33:41.480 --> 04:33:43.480
Jazz. Or even worse than that, could be.

04:33:43.560 --> 04:33:48.020
 

04:33:48.260 --> 04:33:51.860
 

04:33:56.680 --> 04:33:58.680
Ah, ah.

04:33:58.680 --> 04:33:59.680
 

04:33:59.760 --> 04:34:03.500
First, he will play all the twelves notes which are moved in Bhairavi.

04:34:03.500 --> 04:34:06.620
And then you see how he keeps to them.

04:34:06.620 --> 04:34:10.060
He keeps to that mood that way.

04:34:10.060 --> 04:34:12.060
 

04:34:12.060 --> 04:34:14.060
 

04:34:14.060 --> 04:34:16.060
Woah, wah.

04:34:18.780 --> 04:34:22.460
It's the heart chakra. it's the heart chakra of Shiva.

04:34:27.420 --> 04:34:31.880
 

04:34:31.880 --> 04:34:33.880
 

04:34:33.880 --> 04:34:35.880
 

04:35:16.080 --> 04:35:18.080
 

04:35:19.580 --> 04:35:21.580
 

04:35:24.940 --> 04:35:26.240
 

04:35:34.820 --> 04:35:36.820
 

04:35:42.160 --> 04:35:44.160
 

04:36:14.860 --> 04:36:16.860
 

04:36:30.500 --> 04:36:32.500
 

04:36:32.500 --> 04:36:34.200
 

04:36:34.500 --> 04:36:36.500
Surrendering.

04:36:36.500 --> 04:36:38.500
 

04:36:41.560 --> 04:36:44.880
The surrendering, you see, as Islam means "surrender".

04:36:45.020 --> 04:36:48.400
Islam is the "surrender".

04:42:15.680 --> 04:42:20.680
 

04:42:26.460 --> 04:42:29.320
He's been calling [inaudible].

04:42:53.500 --> 04:42:55.840
Now, this is the call  [inaudible].

04:42:55.840 --> 04:42:57.840
 

04:42:57.840 --> 04:42:59.840
 

04:42:59.840 --> 04:43:01.840
 

04:43:01.840 --> 04:43:03.840
 

05:20:27.660 --> 05:20:30.060
What an enjoyment! What an enjoyment!

05:20:30.740 --> 05:20:32.740
Tremendous!

05:20:32.740 --> 05:20:35.400
 

05:21:23.320 --> 05:21:25.540
Please, be seated.

05:21:29.140 --> 05:21:32.400
I have to especially thank him for one thing

05:21:32.980 --> 05:21:36.640
that he has now prepared really for you,

05:21:36.940 --> 05:21:38.940
the Guru Purnima for you.

05:21:39.360 --> 05:21:41.460
He's worked it out really very well.

05:21:41.460 --> 05:21:44.140
I can see that, I can feel it.

05:21:44.800 --> 05:21:50.160
It has worked within ourselves that depth and that beauty.

05:21:50.700 --> 05:21:56.780
And now with music, you see, it's this excavation within ourselves, you see.

05:21:57.420 --> 05:21:59.800
Facing it within yourself.

05:21:59.840 --> 05:22:04.040
All these things with music become

05:22:04.040 --> 05:22:07.380
not only harmless but also so gentle,

05:22:07.380 --> 05:22:09.380
that you don't feel that it is happening.

05:22:09.380 --> 05:22:11.140
It just works.

05:22:11.320 --> 05:22:16.380
You see, the- like very gentle waves you see, it works within you and

05:22:16.800 --> 05:22:20.700
you start developing that personality which is very important

05:22:20.700 --> 05:22:22.700
for a function like Guru Purnima.

05:22:22.700 --> 05:22:29.160
And the beauty and the joy

05:22:29.160 --> 05:22:33.360
they all work it out so beautifully that you don't feel that it is all working,

05:22:33.360 --> 05:22:35.080
but I know it's really.

05:22:35.080 --> 05:22:41.240
But, supposing, if I say something as a Guru, maybe I may hurt you.

05:22:41.240 --> 05:22:47.820
You may feel upset and you also may feel facing yourself

05:22:47.940 --> 05:22:51.220
a little bit, sometimes reluctant maybe diffident.

05:22:51.840 --> 05:22:56.100
You might feel little sort of dejected or depressed.

05:22:56.620 --> 05:23:00.660
Or you may feel sometimes also if elevate you

05:23:00.720 --> 05:23:03.160
you might feel egoistical, you see.

05:23:03.160 --> 05:23:10.540
So the words could be, could not render service as properly as the notes can

05:23:10.540 --> 05:23:14.140
because the notes just penetrate within you

05:23:14.160 --> 05:23:19.380
and work it out so smoothly  that you don't feel it's working there.

05:23:19.380 --> 05:23:21.340
It's working no doubt.

05:23:21.340 --> 05:23:24.040
It's like mantras it works, like mantras only.

05:23:24.780 --> 05:23:30.220
And when it's enlightened notes, it has great effect.

05:23:30.960 --> 05:23:33.140
I haven't brought you photographs

05:23:33.140 --> 05:23:35.140
where, when you are playing before Me,

05:23:35.140 --> 05:23:37.140
you go into complete lights.

05:23:38.480 --> 05:23:40.480
I have got those photographs with Me.

05:23:40.480 --> 05:23:43.300
Of course, also we have got  the [inaudible]

05:23:43.640 --> 05:23:47.340
And we have got photographs, now, tomorrow we will be able to show you,

05:23:47.340 --> 05:23:50.580
where the lights change their forms,

05:23:50.580 --> 05:23:53.880
how through vibrations, how they change their forms, you see.

05:23:54.520 --> 05:23:57.680
And how the vibrations work it out, you see?

05:23:58.400 --> 05:24:03.240
But the, even the notes are used by vibrations as "vahanas" [vessel]

05:24:04.020 --> 05:24:06.360
The notes are used and the notes

05:24:06.360 --> 05:24:11.140
take the "vahanas" position

05:24:11.140 --> 05:24:12.820
and they penetrate.

05:24:12.820 --> 05:24:17.000
When there is somebody: you are singing before a Realized soul

05:24:17.000 --> 05:24:20.020
or an evolved personality,

05:24:20.020 --> 05:24:25.400
then the Chaitanya flows within you.

05:24:25.400 --> 05:24:29.200
But notes are very helpful, I've seen, the beautiful notes,

05:24:29.200 --> 05:24:30.720
and in harmony, you see.

05:24:30.860 --> 05:24:32.820
It's so much in harmony with you,

05:24:32.820 --> 05:24:34.820
that you don't feel the penetration.

05:24:35.540 --> 05:24:42.180
You don't feel the injection, you don't feel the going within you.

05:24:42.180 --> 05:24:44.320
Just it works and it just moves and

05:24:44.620 --> 05:24:47.360
I was seeing your brain also opening out quite a lot

05:24:47.620 --> 05:24:50.420
because the heart is so much connected with your brain now,

05:24:50.500 --> 05:24:52.020
you are integrated.

05:24:52.020 --> 05:24:55.040
So it's wonderful and you are all becoming thoughtless

05:24:55.040 --> 05:24:56.600
and beautiful.

05:24:56.700 --> 05:25:00.820
I think you all have enjoyed his things and we have to thank him very much

05:25:01.180 --> 05:25:04.540
because our Guru Purnima day that he agreed to come

05:25:04.540 --> 05:25:05.040
 

05:25:05.060 --> 05:25:08.540
and has done the job halfway for Me.

05:25:08.540 --> 05:25:14.680
I'm thankful to him that now, even if I say something, you won't feel hurt.

05:25:14.680 --> 05:25:16.680
 

05:25:16.680 --> 05:25:18.680
 

05:25:23.360 --> 05:25:25.360
 

05:25:25.360 --> 05:25:27.360
 

05:25:31.020 --> 05:25:33.880
It is nice to be a Mother.

05:25:33.880 --> 05:25:38.020
Mother is a very easy thing, it's to just to express your love and

05:25:38.180 --> 05:25:39.840
the children are nice.

05:25:39.920 --> 05:25:43.340
But for a Mother to be a Guru is the most difficult task.

05:25:43.340 --> 05:25:47.640
And that, if I have to do, a Mother to be a Guru,

05:25:47.640 --> 05:25:50.960
then I think this preparation is a very good idea because

05:25:50.960 --> 05:25:53.540
first of all, now, you are smoothed out

05:25:53.540 --> 05:25:55.900
and you are much better

05:25:56.000 --> 05:25:58.940
so it's all right, as a Guru I can tell you some things.

05:25:59.080 --> 05:26:03.600
Otherwise, for a Mother to be Guru is the worst thing that she can do

05:26:03.680 --> 05:26:08.540
and to act as a Guru but sometimes, you have to be corrected.

05:26:09.880 --> 05:26:15.080
But I think this one has created a beautiful atmosphere and I am very thankful to him

05:26:15.080 --> 05:26:17.080
for this preparation

05:26:17.080 --> 05:26:19.760
of your minds and your brains.

05:26:19.760 --> 05:26:25.200
We are very honoured and, as I said in the beginning, I'm extremely honoured.

05:26:25.940 --> 05:26:30.480
And, of course, it's very difficult to use words

05:26:30.480 --> 05:26:34.100
on how I feel at this moment.

05:26:34.100 --> 05:26:38.520
Because to be invited to play for Guru Purnima

05:26:38.520 --> 05:26:41.220
is a great blessing for us.

05:26:41.220 --> 05:26:45.540
And it's your blessing and it's a great honour and

05:26:45.540 --> 05:26:50.100
we would have been very disappointed if you had not invited us to play today.

05:26:50.340 --> 05:26:53.420
I was anxious that you should be invited actually.

05:26:53.420 --> 05:26:53.920
Thank you.

05:26:53.920 --> 05:26:56.460
That you should be here and you should do this

05:26:56.460 --> 05:27:00.360
because you see, if you have seen the mid-career that you do

05:27:00.460 --> 05:27:04.800
with that you were pulling the strings of their hearts, I could see it clearly

05:27:04.920 --> 05:27:05.880
the importance, you see.

05:27:06.900 --> 05:27:11.600
Some or other, I thought I can work through you better

05:27:11.600 --> 05:27:14.560
than through my own words directly.

05:27:15.520 --> 05:27:18.900
It's an indirect way of working out things like this

05:27:18.900 --> 05:27:21.400
and you have been very, very helpful,  cooperative.

05:27:21.400 --> 05:27:21.900
 

05:27:21.900 --> 05:27:24.300
I'm thankful to you for this wisdom.

05:27:24.300 --> 05:27:27.120
So, I don't know how to also

05:27:27.120 --> 05:27:29.320
say something about

05:27:29.320 --> 05:27:31.320
Indian music.

05:27:31.320 --> 05:27:33.340
But I can definitely say

05:27:33.340 --> 05:27:36.800
that the way you are appreciating Indian music

05:27:36.900 --> 05:27:38.900
is really very creditable.

05:27:38.900 --> 05:27:44.500
I just can't understand really how you people are so much appreciative of this music.

05:27:44.500 --> 05:27:46.500
I'm just- it's the Spirit

05:27:46.500 --> 05:27:48.500
or whatever you may say

05:27:48.500 --> 05:27:53.160
it's something remarkable and even the artists are so enamoured by that.

05:27:53.240 --> 05:27:54.240
To see such a -

05:27:54.240 --> 05:27:54.740
Absolutely.

05:27:54.860 --> 05:27:56.820
Absolutely. They're having rapport and all that.

05:27:56.820 --> 05:27:58.340
They are very much enamoured by you.

05:27:58.480 --> 05:27:59.080
Wonderful.

05:27:59.080 --> 05:28:05.260
And they are very thankful to you the way you are just following every note and every movement

05:28:05.260 --> 05:28:06.140
 

05:28:06.140 --> 05:28:10.060
with such intense concentration.

05:28:10.060 --> 05:28:12.060
 

05:28:12.060 --> 05:28:16.300
But it's your blessings Mataji, it's your blessing that this whole atmosphere

05:28:16.380 --> 05:28:16.920
Yes.

05:28:16.920 --> 05:28:18.700
worked out like this.  Otherwise...

05:28:18.700 --> 05:28:22.420
Really more for - I don't know whom to thank. You or their aim.

05:28:22.420 --> 05:28:26.200
But I think it is mutual thanking is needed

05:28:26.200 --> 05:28:28.500
because you were enjoying him and he was enjoying you.

05:28:28.500 --> 05:28:30.780
Otherwise, it would not have been possible.

05:28:30.780 --> 05:28:35.640
Without a proper audience, artist also doesn't get the encouragement to play so well.

05:28:35.640 --> 05:28:37.360
[Hindi]

05:28:37.360 --> 05:28:40.080
Audience has to have a rapport otherwise

05:28:40.220 --> 05:28:43.400
[Hindi]

05:28:43.800 --> 05:28:48.940
 

05:28:48.940 --> 05:28:50.940
 

05:28:50.940 --> 05:28:52.940
 

05:28:52.940 --> 05:28:55.560
You have not put anything for the Russians so far here?

05:28:55.560 --> 05:28:57.560
There are too many there, it seems.

05:28:57.560 --> 05:28:59.560
 

05:29:00.300 --> 05:29:03.040
Just simple thing like that.

05:29:03.040 --> 05:29:05.040
Moscow and then Kyiv.

05:29:05.040 --> 05:29:07.040
Moscow, Leningrad.

05:29:07.040 --> 05:29:09.040
Kyiv also.

05:29:09.040 --> 05:29:11.040
 

05:29:11.040 --> 05:29:11.940
 

05:29:12.140 --> 05:29:16.660
[Hindi]

05:29:16.660 --> 05:29:18.660
 

05:29:18.660 --> 05:29:20.660
 

05:29:21.700 --> 05:29:24.140
A little gift for him from you all.

05:29:24.140 --> 05:29:24.660
 

05:29:24.660 --> 05:29:26.660
 

05:29:26.660 --> 05:29:30.900
Only what I can tell him is to keep the music on.

05:29:30.900 --> 05:29:32.020
 

05:29:32.160 --> 05:29:34.160
[Hindi]

05:29:34.160 --> 05:29:34.660
 

05:29:34.660 --> 05:29:36.660
 

05:29:36.660 --> 05:29:38.660
 

05:29:38.660 --> 05:29:55.160
 

05:29:55.160 --> 05:29:57.160
 

05:29:57.160 --> 05:29:59.160
 

05:29:59.160 --> 05:30:01.160
 

05:30:01.160 --> 05:30:03.160
 

05:30:03.160 --> 05:30:05.160
 

05:30:05.160 --> 05:30:07.160
 

05:30:07.160 --> 05:30:09.160
 

05:30:10.000 --> 05:30:13.680
So, now for- what should I say?

05:30:13.680 --> 05:30:15.660
"Good morning" to you?

05:30:15.660 --> 05:30:16.820
 

05:30:16.820 --> 05:30:19.660
I think still that will be about -

05:30:19.660 --> 05:30:21.660
till twelve o'clock you can have rest.

05:30:21.660 --> 05:30:23.380
Then we'll see you. All right?

05:30:23.380 --> 05:30:25.160
May God bless you. Thank you

05:30:29.660 --> 05:30:31.660
 

05:30:31.660 --> 05:30:33.660
 

05:30:33.660 --> 05:30:35.660
 

05:30:35.660 --> 05:30:37.660
 

05:30:37.660 --> 05:30:42.020
 

05:30:42.020 --> 05:30:44.020
 

05:30:44.020 --> 05:30:46.020
 

05:30:46.020 --> 05:30:48.020
 

05:30:48.020 --> 05:30:50.540
