1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,600
One should know that you have to be responsible:

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,200
that’s a very, very important thing of life.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,360
I personally think, unless and until you feel that responsibility,

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,880
that heart into Sahaja Yoga, you will enjoy just my talk

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,440
as you would just enjoy anything else.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,600
Real enjoyment comes when your Spirit really blows out the vibrations.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,120
You are taking my vibrations, all right, you are feeling them, but what about yours?

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,000
Are you blowing your vibrations out or they are just eating your brain?

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,800
Simple questions is, are you blowing any vibrations outside?

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,440
We have some Sahaja Yogis when they just enter into a house

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,040
immediately everyone feels it. Everyone can feel it that somebody has come.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Immediately the whole thing cools down in no time. Somebody has come.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,360
There are some here also, not that there are none, but they are few people.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,240
You have to blow out vibrations otherwise you are just a liability to yourself.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,400
Why don’t you blow out vibrations? Because you don’t feel responsible.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,120
In your day-to-day life, morning till evening, you have to see

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,000
that you develop this instrument of responsibility within you,

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,280
otherwise the vibrations won’t flow because, the main reason is

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:32,680
that our nervous system comes to us through our Right Side.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,680
Our nervous system is built up by our Right Side.

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,400
All the elements within us have built [it] up. If the elements are weakened,

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,080
if the chakras which are made by these elements —

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,400
as you know all these chakras are made by elements —

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
if the pot is weak, nothing is going to work out.

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,680
You should be able to hold that water of love

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,680
or you can say the water of bliss

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,320
and should be able to pour it out to others.

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,480
Unless and until you are able to do that, Sahaja Yoga won’t spread.

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,960
The point is: in all this talking of Spirit and God,

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,080
one has to know [that] the vehicle has to be better.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,840
The vehicle is so very poor that it cannot carry:

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,360
otherwise you will emit vibrations like this. I know you can.

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Wherever you will stand you’ll attract people.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,200
People must gather round you! You will be amazed,

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
I went to Australia for how many months?

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,200
At the most a month or so, and I came back from there:

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,520
already seven centres have started

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,120
and every centre has got at least three hundred regular people coming!

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,400
It is not to feel guilty: I am not saying [for that],

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,200
but to awaken yourself, to arise to this point,

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,360
to be elated with understanding that you have to rise up to that point

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
and that you have to take up that position

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,080
because you are the warriors of Truth.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,560
You are the people who are seekers, you have been for ages,

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,960
and you have no business to be irresponsible and you have to do it.

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,400
It is my earnest desire that you understand what I am saying.
