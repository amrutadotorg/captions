00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
I bow to all the seekers of truth

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.500
at the very outset

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840
We have to know that

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.389
Truth is what it is

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.119
You cannot change it

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.180
You cannot describe it

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.750
Unfortunately at this human awareness, you cannot know it

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.630
Whatever. I am going to tell you today

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.510
Please do not accept it

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.379
Blindfolded

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.379
We have had lots of problems

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.049
With this blindfolded failed so far

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.840
so best is to

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.019
keep your mind open like scientist and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.210
Treat my talk as a hypothesis and if you find it

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.699
That what I am saying saying can be proved then you must accept it

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.259
Because it is for your benevolence

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.460
It is for the benevolence of your family

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.489
It is for the benevolence of your city

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.009
many Valence of Your country the Benevolence of the whole world

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.209
So what is the truth the truth is?

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.798
That you are not this body this mind

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.279
This intellect these emotions

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.409
This ego or your conditionings, but you are the pure spirit

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.209
The second truth is that we see such beautiful flowers here

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.390
And we take them for granted

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.718
If you think about it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960
It is a miracle

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.340
and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.450
If you ask the doctor who runs your heart?

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.959
He will say

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.898
It's an autonomous nervous system, but if you ask the doctor who is this auto? He won't be able to tell you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.309
science itself has its own limitation

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400
For example it is a-moral

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.510
secondly science cannot answer

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
many fundamental questions

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.449
For example, we don't know why are we on this Earth

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.919
We don't know why did we evolve to the human state and science cannot tell you why are we here

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.649
This question can be only answered

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.550
if

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.949
Your awareness is raised to a higher state

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.250
In the evolutionary process

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040
You have become human beings

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.480
But you don't know the absolute truth

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.750
That's why we have so many theories so many quarrels so many fights

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.379
amounting to war like atmosphere

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.619
But somehow if you know the absolute truth

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.339
then all of you will know the same, there cannot be any argument fights or

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.350
The question of war doesn't arise with such people

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.580
What is most important for us to know  [is]

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.510
that most of the world problems come from human beings and

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.629
all of the human problems

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.920
come from

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.660
the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.660
problems of these

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:24.139
centers, subtle centers of energy, which are within us. These subtle centers of energy

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.140
which are within us are responsible for our physical, emotional

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.740
also financial,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.340
above all,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.680
the spiritual problem

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.399
The sort of spiritual problem is very obvious nowadays

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.730
This is [a] special time

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.010
when it is said that

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.159
People will be seeking the truth

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.670
In the ancient books in India

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.029
Bhrigu muni has described exactly

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.929
when Sahaja Yoga will start and

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.780
How the people would be?

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.020
seeking the truth and

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.450
How their Kundalini will be awakened

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.809
and how they will achieve

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.810
the state of

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.300
self-knowledge

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.119
We have William Blake, a great poet from England about 100 Years back

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300
He said that at this time

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.040
Men of God will be born and they will get their divinity and

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.190
They'll make others also divine

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.739
We have Rabindranath Tagore in India who has also described

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.499
CS Lewis also has described, so many people have described about

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.100
Sahaj Yoga

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.129
That this is the special time

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.770
I call it the blossom time

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.409
Because there are so many beautiful flowers

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.040
about to become the fruits

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.869
But it is also called in the Koran as Qiyamah

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.530
Mohammed Sahib has said that at this time

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.950
your hands will speak and

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.780
they'll give witness against you --
 means in your hands you will feel your centers, and they will tell you what's wrong with you

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.889
Apart from that, Guru Nanaka has described

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.830
beautifully about this time how what will happen and how this

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.549
miracle of transformation of human beings will take place

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.439
In the Bible, we have the last judgment

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.710
whatever we read, we think by reading we'll achieve

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.476
higher life

00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:09.090
is a misconception

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.879
there's a poet called Kabira in India who said

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:22.709
[Sanskrit] -- by reading too much even the learned have become stupid

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.090
I couldn't understand how can

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.269
the people who have read too much can become stupid but now I meet so many of them

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:35.969
Nothing goes into their head

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.140
Because they have learned certain things that are going on.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.920
the other day I met the lead gentlemen

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.289
the head of the

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.000
New York Hare Rama Hare Krishna

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.780
He came to me

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:56.345
I said why are you wearing this dhoti in this country, it's such a cold country

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:58.349
What is the need to wear a dhoti here?

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:05.609
He said my guru has told me that this is the initiation [you] where the dhoti I said by wearing Dhoti

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.210
Are you going to go?

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.109
To something higher yes my guru taught

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.560
In our country everybody wears a nothing

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:20.848
And all the time they talk of Hare Ram, or higher education are they all going to go to heavens?

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.479
He said see you are talking against my guru who I can't bear it, so I'm not talking against your guru

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.959
But I am a mother I have to tell you the truth

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:34.619
This way you are bound now to this kind of a stupid

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:41.249
austerity in a place like New York where the temperature is below zero you are wearing a dhoti

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.029
I as a mother I don't want you to wear it. It's nonsense

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:48.479
That's all I am telling what is the need to wear the dhoti?

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.059
The dhoti is of no use

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:58.709
Because I have seen people dancing in Oxford street, and the whole dhoti Everything falls down because they don't know how to wear it

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.979
This is not the way

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.430
You feel spiritual

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:12.239
It's not outside -- it is inside within yourself

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:18.989
It has to happen within yourself it cannot happen outside by changing dresses

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.829
I said you are like hippies

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:26.969
Because you think by changing the dress you are going to achieve something he says but we don't drink we don't smoke

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.220
I said Sahaja Yogis also. Don't drink and don't smoke, but it's not compulsory for them

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.010
Automatically they have given up

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.279
So how it has happened it has happened like this

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.329
that

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:45.899
Supposing I am very obstinate like a Hare Rama Hare Krishna, supposing. They're holding on

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.510
to a snake and

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:56.159
You tell me that see there's a snake in your hand and darkness. [I] can't see so I will say no. There's no snake

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.959
this is a

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.699
rope

00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:07.409
The snake bites me. I'll go on holding on to that snake but supposing there is little light

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:11.129
Immediately, I'll see the snake moving. I'll throw it away

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:16.169
It's like this unless and until you have enlightenment

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.990
You cannot achieve

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.909
Self realization that is both are just the same enlightenment means

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.410
Self-Realization

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:36.180
Now they said about the bhakti means devotion, we pray to God you are praying to God there are many people who pray to

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.909
God also like that. I have seen I was born myself in a Christian family, and I was surprised they

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:47.578
Would just wear very materialistic people praying to God or God give me a son

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.099
Give me money. Give me this give me that as if the God is in their pocket

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.750
It goes on like this

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:05.729
You are not yet connected to the divine unless until you are connected to God. What are you asking? It is very?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.500
Down-To-Earth

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.830
understanding that if you do not have

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.909
Connection in your telephone, who are you telephoning?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.210
On the contrary your telephone

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.880
May get out of order

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.700
if not that

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.400
if not that

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.180
You will go mad

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.440
absolutely

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.419
Because like mad you are singing there like mad. They are moving about

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.270
This is sheer madness

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.820
Wasting a beautiful life

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.690
For which you have come to achieve your ascent

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.199
Of course let me go to religion

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.350
Nothing wrong with the religion as such

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.280
but wrong with our own understanding I

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.610
Feel Christ and Mohammed Sahib and all these great people never understood human beings

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.000
They were too great, too pure they had no human realization

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.030
Because Christ says in the fifth chapter Matthews

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.429
that if your one eye does something wrong, take it out

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.549
If another one does something wrong take it out

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.229
If your hand does something wrong, cut the hand

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.840
Another hand cut

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.469
I haven't met one

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.410
Christian who has taken out even one eye

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:37.200
If they had followed Christ there would have been people without eyes without hides all over

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.020
then he says that if they slap you on your

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.900
one cheek, you turn another cheek

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.890
I haven't seen anyone like that

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:57.929
Can imagine the Christians going round the whole world occupying all the places with the Bible in one hand and a revolver in that other

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.120
Where is the principle of Christ?

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.970
Who follows that?

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.130
Vatican does not follow

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.059
Churches do not follow. How can the people follow that?

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.020
Christ didn't know nobody wants to take out their eyes whatever it is

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:20.398
He got himself crucified, alright

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.999
He was too great for us

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:31.049
Then Mohammed Sahib must have thought that Christ has been so strict, too strict

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:34.708
With the men so let us do something for women also

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:41.039
Now horrible things he has written for women who go into immoral life

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:41.679
now imagine

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:44.339
What would happen to American ladies, I don't know

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:48.519
horrifying

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:55.469
Because they thought that if people become immoral, then they're lost --
 they're finished, they are good for nothing

00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:04.709
Then also Sharia he brought

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:05.290
Sharia as they call it, which was given to Jews by Moses

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:12.689
when he saw the decadent society of Jews when he came all the way with the ten commandments

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:15.740
he was surprised how decadent they were and he knew they cannot follow these commandments

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:21.779
so he wrote down all this Sharia which is in the Jeremiah

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:30.089
if you read, in the Bible itself in the Old Testament

00:14:31.929 --> 00:14:33.929
now

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:42.748
so one should understand that these great people gave the religion, but that one was very very difficult to follow

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:50.579
In that way we have to understand that

00:14:51.999 --> 00:14:57.539
These people expected us to be of a level which we are not

00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:03.119
The level is of a saint of an enlightened person

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:06.490
who

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.929
innately

00:15:07.929 --> 00:15:12.389
Is righteous, is religious, you don't have to tell anything and

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.999
He doesn't do anything wrong if by mistake he does something he repents for it

00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:21.389
so this

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:27.448
state we have to achieve first and that state I call as the state of self knowledge

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.890
so when this Kundalini rises

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.010
She passes through six centers now this also

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:42.140
Very important to understand that she passes through six centers and the seventh Center is the red one below

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.710
this seventh center looks after

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.840
pelvic plexus which is responsible for our

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.650
excretion

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.360
inclusive of sex

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.640
So sex has nothing to do with our ascent

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.010
actually

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.309
when your Kundalini ascending

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.930
you just

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:13.190
Stop your activity of the pelvic plexus, completely entirely you become like a child

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:20.299
You become like a child because here innocence is never lost whatever you may do

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:27.830
To destroy it it is there because it is of an eternal nature, it is eternal

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.330
Some clouds are there but as soon as the Kundalini rises

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.650
This innocence start manifesting and you are amazed

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:44.270
What happens to you firstly all these centers get enlightened

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:51.109
They get integrated and your health improves automatically

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.200
if I say

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:02.030
You need not believe, but I can tell you for doctors in India in Delhi University have got their

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:09.829
MD from [unclear] to MD in curing in curable diseases

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.530
because when she (Kundalini) rises

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.219
She enlightens all the centers

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.760
Fundamentally [we] are nothing but these centers

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:29.689
When these centers go into trouble, then only we get all kinds of diseases

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.660
Sometimes they are somatic

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.570
sometimes they are psychosomatic
