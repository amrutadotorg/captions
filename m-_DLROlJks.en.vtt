and it happened I really saw

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.090

how do you uh transfer just like this

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:30.000
I saw so many permutations of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.000
[Music]

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:41.040

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:46.200

were dancing tonight and we colors I'll

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:10.640
spread out their lighter the center I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.640
thought wrong

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.610
to mess with top

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.820
[Music]

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:27.600
so dark and alone laughs so now it's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.900
Halloween and they were also emitting

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.900
light

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.420
[Music]

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.739
done

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:55.940
first I'd open up myself then you were

00:02:48.739 --> 00:03:10.360
silent and then I think that tremendous

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:10.360
work so much I will miss Theresa vanes

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.970
happiness on fetched

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.320
[Music]

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.870
that

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.870
[Music]

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.870
20

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.030
savage that lesson

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:48.150
everything was fetched

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:51.880
[Music]

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.150
the Sahara is the blessing of the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.780
heavens I should say it has worked out

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.390
so well it's very difficult to break the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.820
sahasrara and when I really broke it I

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.090
didn't know that it would be that

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.400
successful first I thought is still

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.950
premature because there are many

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.290
daksha's are still on this street

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.169
selling their books and there are many

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.669
fanatics who are calling themselves by

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.700
the so-called religions they are

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:33.280
following not the real religion of the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:37.330
earth but gradually it has taken its

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.320
roots now let this truth take its root

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.160
within yourself through your system and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.860
once this truth becomes absolutely the

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.290
light that guides you the light that

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.060
nourishes you the light that enlightens

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:58.419
you and gives you a personality that has

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.120
the light then only you should know that

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.910
your sister arise completely enlightened

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.180
by your spirit your face should be such

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.490
that people should know that there's a

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.800
personality was standing before you

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:17.340
who is light this is how sahasrara is to

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.340
be looked after

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.139
please close your eyes

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.350
as it is kundalini has risen quite high

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.240
I feel it but it has to cross through

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.810
the last point which is the seventh

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:42.870
Center Collis Ostara to pierce through

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:45.450
the whole of is called as the Brahma is

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.380
the brahmarandra where you get your

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.130

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.120
eyes that's very important part of

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:07.290
sahaja yoga that you don't open your

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:09.210
eyes because if you open your eyes then

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.870
the Kundalini doesn't rise about our

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.180
