https://www.amruta.org/1976/03/30/gudi-padwa-delhi-1976/

00:07.460 --> 00:09.900
We cannot meditate

00:10.310 --> 00:14.390
we only can be in meditation

00:14.895 --> 00:18.110
When we say we are going to meditate

00:18.385 --> 00:20.110
it has no meaning

00:20.830 --> 00:24.410
We have to be in meditation

00:25.450 --> 00:30.255
Either you are inside the house or outside the house

00:30.580 --> 00:37.101
You cannot be inside the house and then say that: “Now I’m outside the house.”

00:37.465 --> 00:42.135
Or when you are outside the house you cannot say: “I’m inside the house.”

00:42.625 --> 00:44.105
In the same way

00:44.240 --> 00:49.631
you are moving in three dimensions of your life

00:49.870 --> 00:53.575
– of emotional and physical and mental being

00:54.355 --> 00:58.041
You are not inside yourself.

00:58.400 --> 01:07.985
But when you are inside that you are in thoughtless awareness.

01:08.365 --> 01:10.515
Then, not only that you are there

01:10.635 --> 01:12.551
but you are everywhere

01:12.740 --> 01:14.551
because that is the place

01:14.820 --> 01:19.201
that is the point where you are really in universal…

01:19.760 --> 01:23.900
From there you are in contact with the Principle

01:24.240 --> 01:31.991
with the Shakti, with the Power that permeates into every particle

01:32.200 --> 01:37.225
that is matter , into every thought that is emotion

01:37.525 --> 01:42.881
into every planning and thinking of the whole world.

01:43.440 --> 01:53.455
You permeate into all the elements that have created this beautiful Earth

01:53.560 --> 01:57.931
You permeate into earth

01:58.325 --> 02:02.131
you permeate into Akasha [sky, ether]

02:02.570 --> 02:04.341
into teja [light]

02:04.710 --> 02:08.351
into sound

02:09.260 --> 02:13.961
But your movement is very slow.

02:14.725 --> 02:18.395
Then you say: “I’m meditating,”

02:19.105 --> 02:29.315
that means you are moving in permeation with the Universal Being

02:30.085 --> 02:33.091
But you are not moving yourself

02:33.650 --> 02:37.531
you are just unloading yourself to be free

02:37.695 --> 02:43.821
from the weight of things that do not allow you to move

02:46.155 --> 02:54.911
When you are in meditation you must allow yourself to be in thoughtless awareness

02:55.515 --> 03:01.571
There, the Unconscious Itself, the Achetana itself will take charge of you

03:02.525 --> 03:06.991
You will start moving with the force of Achetana.

03:07.505 --> 03:10.060
The Unconscious is going to work it out.

03:10.230 --> 03:15.545
It is going to take you there, where It wants you to go

03:16.220 --> 03:19.611
You keep to thoughtless awareness all the time.

03:20.075 --> 03:24.240
Try to keep to thoughtless awareness as much as you can.

03:24.650 --> 03:26.650
When you are in thoughtless awareness

03:26.695 --> 03:30.495
you must know that you are in the Kingdom of God

03:30.845 --> 03:38.460
and His people , His arrangements, His consciousness

03:38.680 --> 03:41.631
is going to look after you.

03:42.795 --> 03:46.135
Even when you are giving vibrations to other people

03:46.395 --> 03:50.750
I have noticed that you are not in thoughtless awareness.

03:51.340 --> 03:54.480
If you give vibrations in thoughtless awareness

03:54.655 --> 03:57.321
you will not catch anything

03:57.640 --> 04:00.970
because all these entities that enter into you

04:01.370 --> 04:04.620
all these material problems that come into you

04:04.760 --> 04:12.731
come when you are in those three dimensions.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.050
Through Sahaja Yoga

04:16.195 --> 04:20.961
you have opened your gates of your own being.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.950
You have entered into your own kingdom

04:24.335 --> 04:27.540
but you do not keep there.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.540
You come out of it

04:29.565 --> 04:33.015
and again you go back and settle down – doesn’t matter

04:33.180 --> 04:37.181
You should not feel so disappointed about it, so frustrated.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.060
You know people have worked for thousands of years

04:40.060 --> 04:44.510
and they could not separate themselves from themselves

04:44.990 --> 04:48.971
Only you people, the Sahaja Yogis

04:49.310 --> 04:53.531
whom are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh himself

04:53.580 --> 04:55.501
are so powerful

04:55.860 --> 05:02.905
that they can give awakening and realisation to other people.

05:03.565 --> 05:06.910
Even if you are caught up, you have seen you have powers.

05:07.215 --> 05:10.265
Even if you feel that the vibrations are not coming

05:10.280 --> 05:12.135
you know you have powers.

05:12.205 --> 05:14.130
You can give realisations to others.

05:14.330 --> 05:17.530
In your presence people get realisation

05:18.135 --> 05:22.571
But you have to be that power completely.

05:23.805 --> 05:26.135
Supposing there’s something wrong with your car

05:26.615 --> 05:28.585
: But as long as it is moving

05:28.875 --> 05:29.725
it’s alright.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.345
You have to repair it.

05:31.500 --> 05:36.805
You have to repair all the time all our moods

05:36.885 --> 05:40.825
which we have caused ourselves by our foolishness

05:41.140 --> 05:44.525
by our lust, by our greed

05:44.835 --> 05:51.025
by so many false identifications we carried with ourselves.

05:51.440 --> 05:56.520
We must have a complete attention towards our weaknesses

05:56.620 --> 05:59.915
and not towards our achievements.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.595
If we know what are our weaknesses it’s better

06:02.605 --> 06:07.481
that we can really swim across better.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.685
Supposing, on a ship there is a hole

06:13.275 --> 06:16.725
and the water is coming in through that hole

06:17.070 --> 06:21.650
the attention of all the crew, of all the staff

06:21.920 --> 06:28.595
and the captain itself will be on that hole from where the water is coming in, and nowhere else.

06:28.710 --> 06:33.170
In the same way, you must be on the watch-out.

06:33.670 --> 06:38.740
There are so many pitfalls for a Sahaja Yogi – I have seen it.

06:39.260 --> 06:44.095
Of course, even the past is over

06:44.380 --> 06:46.791
even the past can be overcome.

06:47.070 --> 06:55.735
In the present also they have many shadows of the past working.

06:56.220 --> 07:00.260
For example, when you are sitting in a group

07:00.575 --> 07:04.550
you are involved with each other.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.640
Those who are involved with each other

07:07.830 --> 07:11.035
by any relationship whatsoever

07:11.605 --> 07:16.815
must know that this kind of involvement

07:16.855 --> 07:24.285
is not going to help them to attain their individual ascent.

07:24.565 --> 07:31.450
Everybody is ascending individually though you are collectively contacted with each other

07:31.475 --> 07:33.275
and in communication;

07:33.405 --> 07:36.275
but the ascendance is individual

07:36.435 --> 07:38.271
absolutely individual.

07:38.745 --> 07:43.505
So whether he is your son, brother, sister, wife, friend

07:43.805 --> 07:50.235
you must remember that you are not responsible for their ascendance.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.815
You cannot help them for their ascendance.

07:53.990 --> 07:59.865
Only Mother’s Grace and their own desire

08:00.220 --> 08:03.050
their own effort, to give up all that

08:03.050 --> 08:07.615
is three dimensional will help them.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.595
So whenever a thought comes like that

08:10.725 --> 08:20.165
you must know that you have not attained the thoughtless awareness in its full extent

08:20.585 --> 08:22.600
and that’s how you have problems

08:22.755 --> 08:25.220
which are three-dimensional.

08:25.645 --> 08:28.255
Sometimes, a Sahaja Yogi will find

08:28.280 --> 08:30.755
an emotion will come into his mind.

08:31.050 --> 08:34.740
It will be an emotion of dejection or frustration

08:34.865 --> 08:40.740
and he will be disgusted with himself or with others.

08:41.350 --> 08:43.210
Both things are just the same

08:43.440 --> 08:47.681
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis get very disgusted with others.

08:47.980 --> 08:51.355
There should be no disgust that is lasting.

08:51.690 --> 08:52.865
Of course, for a short time

08:52.880 --> 08:55.945
you might feel a disgust. It’s alright. It’s a passing phase

08:56.455 --> 08:59.621
Or you might feel disgusted with yourself –

08:59.900 --> 09:02.000
may be a passing phase.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.845
But if you go on hankering on to it

09:05.070 --> 09:08.325
or if you go on clinging to it

09:08.595 --> 09:12.395
that means you are conditioning yourself

09:13.000 --> 09:17.170
that means you are not in thoughtless awareness

09:17.360 --> 09:19.841
that means that you are in your past

09:19.945 --> 09:25.051
you are making your past a solid mass on your head.

09:25.775 --> 09:28.670
In the present everything is fleeting.

09:28.995 --> 09:35.505
Everything is fleeting that is not eternal

09:35.925 --> 09:38.511
In the present the eternal stays

09:38.610 --> 09:41.125
the rest all drops out

09:41.540 --> 09:45.081
It’s like a moving river which doesn’t stop anywhere

09:45.350 --> 09:48.351
But the moving river is eternal.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.930
The rest of the things are all changing.

09:51.170 --> 09:53.795
If you are on the Eternal Principle

09:54.305 --> 09:58.640
all that is not eternal changes

09:59.090 --> 10:00.640
and drops out

10:00.845 --> 10:06.060
dissolves and becomes nonexistent.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.580
We have to understand our own dignity

10:10.885 --> 10:14.891
our own essence.

10:15.200 --> 10:22.060
The first and foremost is that all the Sahaja Yogis are the chosen ones

10:22.715 --> 10:26.781
They are the people whom God has chosen

10:27.020 --> 10:31.791
In this city of Delhi there are thousands and thousands of people.

10:32.205 --> 10:38.555
All over the world there are so many people that we are suffering from overpopulation

10:39.135 --> 10:43.735
but in Sahaja Yoga there are very, very few people.

10:44.430 --> 10:49.190
And when you are chosen

10:49.200 --> 10:55.010
the first, you must also realise that you are the foundations.

10:55.365 --> 10:58.075
You are the stones that are to be laid down

10:58.210 --> 11:01.205
and have to be strong

11:02.015 --> 11:07.541
have to be forbearing

11:08.350 --> 11:13.795
and that’s why it is necessary that all of you who are now few

11:14.030 --> 11:17.655
who are the first lamps

11:17.820 --> 11:22.205
that are going to enlighten other lamps in the world

11:23.155 --> 11:29.780
you have to enjoy the strength of eternity

11:30.040 --> 11:33.611
the strength of Divine Love

11:33.805 --> 11:37.950
the strength of this Universal Being that you are.

11:38.305 --> 11:40.510
This is what meditation is.

11:40.820 --> 11:42.925
So when Sahaja Yogis ask me:

11:43.030 --> 11:44.735
“What should we do for meditation?”

11:44.780 --> 11:47.890
You be in thoughtless awareness that’s all

11:48.460 --> 11:49.841
Don’t do anything.

11:49.935 --> 11:57.325
At that time, not [only] that you are moving towards the goal

11:58.565 --> 12:01.675
or that the Unconscious is taking charge of you

12:01.925 --> 12:04.981
not only that, but also that you are emitting

12:05.090 --> 12:06.980
for the first time

12:08.145 --> 12:12.010
the Divine into the nature

12:12.900 --> 12:15.665
into your surroundings

12:16.060 --> 12:17.900
into other people

12:18.000 --> 12:23.605
who are universally connected to you

12:24.380 --> 12:29.761
Only thing is that we are used to one thing

12:30.345 --> 12:32.745
that is we must do something about it

12:32.960 --> 12:37.255
and so that’s why we start doing something

12:39.220 --> 12:43.791
Meditation is the most Sahaja method.
