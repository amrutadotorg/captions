00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:25.909
(...) The other day, at the Jungian place,
I was to talk

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.231
to Jung people with Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:33.528
Now Jung, I came to know only when he died,

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:38.065
because there was a little article about
him. I never studied psychology.

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.173
Of course, I tried to learn some vocabulary
to talk to them.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.206
Sometimes I thought, I may have to talk
to them also.

00:00:44.407 --> 00:00:46.631
But these Jungians, all very intellectuals

00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:48.957
and great people sitting before me,
you see.

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:54.756
About hundred of them, the President
of American Jungian society.

00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:57.364
I’d just gone through a book, just before
starting it,

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:01.924
and I saw some diagrams which really
puzzled me.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:05.833
The first conception they had - of course
it’s all mental conception of Jung.

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.670
I don’t blame him because he got
realisation

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.109
but he did not know how the stage was
created,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.146
was what the framework of the stage
and his movement

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:20.095
was still of a seeker to find out how
he got his realization.

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:23.510
And, all movements were linear. They
were not expanding

00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:27.220
from one point all over. So, it was not
so integrated.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.480
Now, the thing they showed was that
at the bottom of it

00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:33.535
was the unconscious, which is never going
to be conscious.

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:39.306
On top of that was the (conscious)
unconscious that can be conscious.

00:01:39.507 --> 00:01:43.794
Then, there was subconscious and on top
of that was the ego.

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:47.758
I mean what a mess of a thing it was
I tell you.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.462
I told them, see, now the word unconscious
itself is confusing.

00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:54.304
What do you mean by unconscious?

00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:59.151
Whatever you don’t feel on your central
nervous system is unconscious – alright.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:04.061
But, what does that mean? We don’t feel
the subconscious.

00:02:04.262 --> 00:02:07.810
Then, subconscious is also unconscious.

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.712
Whatever we don’t feel – for example,
there are certain sounds

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:15.033
of certain frequencies we don’t hear
at all.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:18.847
We hear whatever is tolerable to us
as human beings.

00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:23.027
That you all scientists know. We don’t
hear everything.

00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:27.380
So, all that is unconscious – means it’s
a mixed bag.

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:29.842
All sorts of things mixed up together.

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:35.937
But God is not a hodge podge person, you
see. He is a clear-cut gentleman.

00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:39.171
He knows what he is doing. He is
the greatest organiser.

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:43.978
And, how can he put you into a bag like
that – that the unconscious is below,

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.520
then on top of it is the unconscious that
is going to be conscious,

00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:51.086
on top of it is the subconscious, on top
of the consciousness,

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:53.438
on top of that the ego!

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.580
So you go down, carrying all this inside
you

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:01.702
and where do you go? And how do you go?

00:03:01.903 --> 00:03:07.609
So, the first mistake was that there are
layers one on top of another –

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.979
it’s not so. They are placed vertically.

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:18.395
The ego is on the right-hand side and
superego on the left-hand side.

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:23.224
The future on the right-hand side and
the past on the left-hand side.

00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:25.855
So, the subconscious on the left-hand side

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:28.372
and the supraconscious on the right-hand
side.

00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:33.519
And the central path is kept clear cut.
I mean, in any organisation,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.549
 say if you go to the airport, do you have
like this,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.354
that you have to pass through the walls
to go to the aeroplane?

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:45.097
If we human beings don’t commit such
horrible mistakes,

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:47.749
how can God commit such a mistake?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.032
So, it was absolutely wrong to think that
way.

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:54.226
So, the central path is in the centre,

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:58.817
while the right side is on the right side
and the left side on the left side.

00:03:59.018 --> 00:04:01.885
And you don’t have to go to
the subconscious at all.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:06.285
Because they justified all these people
who are trying to make them hypnosis

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:08.885
or they are trying to hypnotise them

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:12.968
or to give them a new type of a – sort
of an experience –

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.144
all that was unconscious, we should accept.

00:04:15.345 --> 00:04:19.029
Even some people if they start suddenly
jumping, they say – oh, it’s great.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.240
So, the sensations that you get from
the subconscious

00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:25.648
and the supraconscious were accepted
as something great.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.159
It was a confusion of your intellectuals
I should say. Complete.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.717
But it is not so.

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:36.627
Your path is straightforward. Absolutely
for Kundalini.

00:04:36.828 --> 00:04:42.183
Only thing, the One who has to raise it
had to come – that’s all.

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:45.159
But otherwise, it’s all very well,

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:49.847
and there is no need for you to get
into that horrible subconscious.

00:04:50.048 --> 00:04:52.240
When I told them, they were amazed.
They said – Mother, it is so simple.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.331
I said – it’s very simple. Your
unconscious is divided into four.

00:04:56.532 --> 00:04:59.144
One is the collective subconscious,

00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:02.353
one is the collective supraconscious,

00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:05.484
one is – you can say – the collective hell,

00:05:05.685 --> 00:05:13.093
and on top is the super collective
consciousness.

00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:16.359
So where do we have to go? We should
know our destination.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.854
Then we have to reach.
