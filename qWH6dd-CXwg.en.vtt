00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.858
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

00:00:14.358 --> 00:00:17.343
The – whatever is covering is in the Himalayas,

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:21.769
is what is nothing but the water from the sea only.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:27.271
It’s one of the circles, that water passes to the Himalayas,

00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:31.579
then comes back as rivers, again falls into the same sea.

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.652
They have to come to the sea.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:36.915
So it is everything ends up here.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:40.928
And then it is allowed – it goes through tapasya –

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:52.084
it allows the Sun to create that cloud by suffering the heat, heat of the Sun,

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:54.143
and becomes vapours,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.673
and then it goes as clouds and you get your rain.

00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:06.788
In the same way we have to be; we have to bear the heat of others,

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:08.608
the anger of others

00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:14.027
and create vapours – means the blessings, the vibrations for others.

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:19.943
It is with Me, same thing. When I see somebody who is sick and I treat him,

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:23.783
of course I have to bear a little bit, sometimes quite a lot,

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:28.386
then I absorb it and then they become vibrations.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.886
They just start flowing as vibrations.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.681
So this is what you have to learn from the sea,

00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:35.663
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:38.353
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:41.885
But don’t get attached to it, and let it become vapours,

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:48.165
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:53.573
As you all are here, all these vapours as vibrations should flow.

00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:57.610
This method you should try to understand by courage.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.990
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting just on the way:

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.338
“Mother, her feet are out of order, or something gone wrong. Please treat her.”

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:13.365
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat? Are you afraid to treat someone?

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.135
Then there’s another one who comes up to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:22.133
Why can’t you treat? You all can treat them, you can help them,

00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:27.103
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll treat them the better you will be.

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:31.823
You should venture, you should have that much courage to treat others.

00:02:31.903 --> 00:02:35.883
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:43.657
because that is what, like the sea, as you have seen, you become the vibrations.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.738
And when you treat others there are more vibrations.

00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:50.501
Why should God give you vibrations if you are not going to use it?

00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:52.181
Simple logic.

00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:58.122
Why should God give you light if you are not going to use it?

00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:03.679
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light under a measure.”

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:06.219
That’s what we are doing

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.373
when we are not using our hands, our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:16.463
we are not creating vibrations within ourselves.

00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:20.720
The same body that is yours can just become a bundle of vibrations,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.774
if you start using these vibrations.

00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:28.544
But if you don’t use these vibrations you’ll have problems,

00:03:28.624 --> 00:03:31.703
the problems, all the time, and you will not understand:

00:03:31.783 --> 00:03:34.183
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing this” –

00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:37.128
because you are not using your vibrations.

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:41.236
You have to use your vibrations in every way possible,

00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:47.143
wherever is possible, to help others to get all right, to get well.

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:52.343
You can at the most take a bandhan if you like,

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:54.692
if you think that it might hurt you or something,

00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:57.118
but at least use My photograph.

00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:00.928
And after the photograph you can just touch the person, there’s no harm.

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:07.326
After all, if you are afraid even of any troubles,

00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:10.495
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja yogi?

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.537
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s the use of making a ship?

00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:18.751
You have to be seaworthy.

00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:23.090
And that’s what you have to decide, that:

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.518
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:29.045
and for that we are going to absorb all the vibrations,

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.979
we are going to take up everything upon ourselves.”

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.223
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell Me ten times:

00:04:35.303 --> 00:04:39.883
“We went there, then this happened, then that happened, then this.”

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:44.463
But I never tell you anything, what happens to Me, how I came here,

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:46.663
what was there; nothing!

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:52.410
Because I know that all this is, whatever 
I am doing, is created into vibrations.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.160
In the same way have faith, that you are all just like the sea,

00:04:57.354 --> 00:05:01.123
like the Mahaguru, and that whatever you are doing

00:05:01.243 --> 00:05:03.732
is creating vibrations within you,

00:05:03.812 --> 00:05:06.346
by which you can save so many.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.460
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.742
that the more you give, the more you get.

00:05:14.842 --> 00:05:19.733
The more you use your vibrations, much more you’ll get it.

00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:25.408
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it has acted

00:05:25.528 --> 00:05:27.691
in the case of the sea, as I told you,

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:31.632
that the water goes to the Himalayas, comes back at rivers.

00:05:31.712 --> 00:05:39.143
In the same way manifold, manifold your vibrations will be growing,

00:05:39.243 --> 00:05:45.823
and I would say that you should always use our vibrations for helping others,

00:05:45.903 --> 00:05:50.400
for giving to many things, to the plant, to the anything.
