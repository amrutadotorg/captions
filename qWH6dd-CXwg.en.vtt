00:09.430 --> 00:12.858
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

00:14.358 --> 00:17.343
The – whatever is covering is in the Himalayas,

00:17.463 --> 00:21.769
is what is nothing but the water from the sea only.

00:21.889 --> 00:27.271
It’s one of the circles, that water passes to the Himalayas,

00:27.391 --> 00:31.579
then comes back as rivers, again falls into the same sea.

00:31.659 --> 00:33.652
They have to come to the sea.

00:33.732 --> 00:36.915
So it is everything ends up here.

00:37.362 --> 00:40.928
And then it is allowed – it goes through tapasya –

00:41.008 --> 00:52.084
it allows the Sun to create that cloud by suffering the heat, heat of the Sun,

00:52.164 --> 00:54.143
and becomes vapours,

00:54.670 --> 00:59.673
and then it goes as clouds and you get your rain.

00:59.753 --> 01:06.788
In the same way we have to be; we have to bear the heat of others,

01:06.868 --> 01:08.608
the anger of others

01:08.688 --> 01:14.027
and create vapours – means the blessings, the vibrations for others.

01:14.107 --> 01:19.943
It is with Me, same thing. When I see somebody who is sick and I treat him,

01:20.023 --> 01:23.783
of course I have to bear a little bit, sometimes quite a lot,

01:24.793 --> 01:28.386
then I absorb it and then they become vibrations.

01:28.466 --> 01:30.886
They just start flowing as vibrations.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.681
So this is what you have to learn from the sea,

01:33.801 --> 01:35.663
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

01:35.743 --> 01:38.353
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

01:38.433 --> 01:41.885
But don’t get attached to it, and let it become vapours,

01:42.006 --> 01:48.165
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

01:48.245 --> 01:53.573
As you all are here, all these vapours as vibrations should flow.

01:53.766 --> 01:57.610
This method you should try to understand by courage.

01:57.690 --> 02:01.990
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting just on the way:

02:02.070 --> 02:07.338
“Mother, her feet are out of order, or something gone wrong. Please treat her.”

02:08.085 --> 02:13.365
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat? Are you afraid to treat someone?

02:13.981 --> 02:17.135
Then there’s another one who comes up to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

02:17.215 --> 02:22.133
Why can’t you treat? You all can treat them, you can help them,

02:22.213 --> 02:27.103
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll treat them the better you will be.

02:27.367 --> 02:31.823
You should venture, you should have that much courage to treat others.

02:31.903 --> 02:35.883
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

02:36.463 --> 02:43.657
because that is what, like the sea, as you have seen, you become the vibrations.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.738
And when you treat others there are more vibrations.

02:46.818 --> 02:50.501
Why should God give you vibrations if you are not going to use it?

02:50.581 --> 02:52.181
Simple logic.

02:53.321 --> 02:58.122
Why should God give you light if you are not going to use it?

02:58.202 --> 03:03.679
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light under a measure.”

03:05.004 --> 03:06.219
That’s what we are doing

03:06.299 --> 03:13.373
when we are not using our hands, our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

03:13.453 --> 03:16.463
we are not creating vibrations within ourselves.

03:16.543 --> 03:20.720
The same body that is yours can just become a bundle of vibrations,

03:20.800 --> 03:23.774
if you start using these vibrations.

03:24.874 --> 03:28.544
But if you don’t use these vibrations you’ll have problems,

03:28.624 --> 03:31.703
the problems, all the time, and you will not understand:

03:31.783 --> 03:34.183
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing this” –

03:34.263 --> 03:37.128
because you are not using your vibrations.

03:37.208 --> 03:41.236
You have to use your vibrations in every way possible,

03:41.316 --> 03:47.143
wherever is possible, to help others to get all right, to get well.

03:50.098 --> 03:52.343
You can at the most take a bandhan if you like,

03:52.446 --> 03:54.692
if you think that it might hurt you or something,

03:54.812 --> 03:57.118
but at least use My photograph.

03:57.198 --> 04:00.928
And after the photograph you can just touch the person, there’s no harm.

04:01.008 --> 04:07.326
After all, if you are afraid even of any troubles,

04:07.473 --> 04:10.495
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja yogi?

04:12.269 --> 04:16.537
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s the use of making a ship?

04:16.643 --> 04:18.751
You have to be seaworthy.

04:20.764 --> 04:23.090
And that’s what you have to decide, that:

04:23.170 --> 04:25.518
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

04:25.598 --> 04:29.045
and for that we are going to absorb all the vibrations,

04:29.125 --> 04:31.979
we are going to take up everything upon ourselves.”

04:32.059 --> 04:35.223
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell Me ten times:

04:35.303 --> 04:39.883
“We went there, then this happened, then that happened, then this.”

04:39.963 --> 04:44.463
But I never tell you anything, what happens to Me, how I came here,

04:44.543 --> 04:46.663
what was there; nothing!

04:46.966 --> 04:52.410
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing, is created into vibrations.

04:52.490 --> 04:57.160
In the same way have faith, that you are all just like the sea,

04:57.354 --> 05:01.123
like the Mahaguru, and that whatever you are doing

05:01.243 --> 05:03.732
is creating vibrations within you,

05:03.812 --> 05:06.346
by which you can save so many.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.460
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

05:11.580 --> 05:14.742
that the more you give, the more you get.

05:14.842 --> 05:19.733
The more you use your vibrations, much more you’ll get it.

05:19.813 --> 05:25.408
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it has acted

05:25.528 --> 05:27.691
in the case of the sea, as I told you,

05:27.771 --> 05:31.632
that the water goes to the Himalayas, comes back at rivers.

05:31.712 --> 05:39.143
In the same way manifold, manifold your vibrations will be growing,

05:39.243 --> 05:45.823
and I would say that you should always use our vibrations for helping others,

05:45.903 --> 05:50.400
for giving to many things, to the plant, to the anything.
