1
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:08,650
As soon as you start any work in any place,

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,960
first of all they want Me to cure
people and to help them with curatives.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:21,010
Now if I pay attention more to that, then the
main work is to create doctors out of everyone.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,360
That is neglected.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,710
Then you become unpopular.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,800
They think, “Oh, She is not
sympathetic” and this and that.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,830
But now as we have, everybody
can cure now, everyone.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,060
I don’t cure anyone directly.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,830
But they don’t like it.

10
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,760
They want I should be there and their ego to
be pampered and all those things are there.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,557
Rather difficult.

12
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:41,050
It’s not, we are not running an election, you see,

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,990
like we should please others
sort of thing, is not there.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,730
But whatever is reality, if a person has
intelligence – pure intelligence – he can

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:58,930
see that this is something very different and
for that one has to understand that you cannot,

16
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:06,220
you cannot force on anyone that
“You get your Realization”.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,270
In the same way you cannot force
Me that I give you Realization,

18
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,520
because if it does not work, it does not work.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,720
It’s such a living force, you see.

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,660
And that upsets them very soon.

21
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:25,023
I feel that the way this industrial
revolution has come in the west,

22
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:27,940
people have lost their moorings, perhaps.

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,392
They are so confused.

24
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:32,980
With all these gurus coming
down here confusing them and

25
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,338
all kinds of new things coming,
they don’t know where to look.

26
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:41,799
But unless and until you get
your evolution completed,

27
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,570
unless and until you reach that absolute
state of understanding, the chaos will remain.

28
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,390
So one has to try to get to that.

29
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,638
But one must understand you can’t pay for it.

30
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,179
There is no effort.
