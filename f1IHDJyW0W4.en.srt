00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,960
Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure, July16th 1995

2
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:22,869
It is a very important Guru Puja today

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:32,350
because we have completed twenty-five 
years of Guru Puja.

4
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:41,605
(Hindi: "Please put the fan in the rotating 
manner".)

5
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:14,589
Also, it is extremely beautiful

6
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:27,217
to see so many Sahaja Yogis who are, 
really have become, very great.

7
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:38,011
It’s a question of understanding what 
Sahaja Yoga is.

8
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:43,034
It's a very unique discovery, I feel now,

9
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:53,037
that people who were seeking the Truth 
have found it

10
00:01:53,238 --> 00:02:03,787
and have now got it absolutely on their 
central nervous system.

11
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:09,012
Yes, in some places it’s difficult to 
explain

12
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,600
how it has happened, how it has worked out

13
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:17,400
and how, in these twenty-five years, we 
have been able

14
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:24,055
to achieve this expansion of Sahaja Yoga.

15
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:35,788
The main thing, I feel, is that you all 
should know

16
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:42,554
that as the tree grows, the roots have 
to grow much deeper

17
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:47,860
and they should spread also. If it doesn't 
happen,

18
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:53,839
the tree cannot be sustained only by Mother 
Earth.

19
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:01,681
So the roots are in your own life, in your 
own heart.

20
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,100
When we say we have become our own Guru,

21
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:15,211
we should really try to find out with our 
introspection:

22
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:20,061
Are we our Guru or not?

23
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,380
Because, before this your mind was on one 
side

24
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:37,426
and your heart was on another side

25
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:43,172
and your attention was in another 
dimension.

26
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:49,932
So these three things were creating 
confusion within you.

27
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:05,346
If you understand a human being, then you 
will be surprised to see

28
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:14,005
how these three things act separately in a 
human being. And sometimes they fight also.

29
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:18,354
First is your intellect and your mind.

30
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:25,346
Second is your heart, your feelings, your 
emotions.

31
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:41,755
And the third one is your attention.

32
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:49,432
In these modern times, this confusion is 
the worst

33
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:53,981
because all the time your attention is 
outside.

34
00:04:54,182 --> 00:05:01,022
It could be towards beautiful things, or 
beautiful women, or beautiful men or

35
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:07,651
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting 
your energy.

36
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:13,913
Such attention then is absolutely like 
a horse which is let loose.

37
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,176
You cannot control such an attention.

38
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:25,264
And this attention runs wild from one 
to another.

39
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,331
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very 
popular thing

40
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:33,793
to keep the attention moving all the time.

41
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:39,836
But this attention that has to be towards 
the Divine,

42
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:48,346
towards the Almighty, is just being 
frittered away.

43
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:55,338
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

44
00:05:57,012 --> 00:06:02,500
First is to find out about yourself: where 
does your attention go?

45
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:15,425
What makes you feel like looking after or 
concerned for attention?

46
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:20,429
You see, the attention comes from various 
problems,

47
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:30,997
and could be your upbringing where you are 
not controlled,

48
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:45,216
could be your education, could be your 
atmosphere in which you live

49
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:51,189
or could be your own ego or your 
conditioning.

50
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:57,828
(Hindi: "The water is maybe a bit too cold, 
that's why.

51
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:12,367
What is it, tea? Is it hot?

52
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:17,386
Pour it here, I'll drink it.

53
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,739
That's fine".)

54
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:41,646
So, this attention is being attacked

55
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:53,795
by all these outside energies or negative 
forces

56
00:07:54,125 --> 00:08:01,374
and it gets entangled - like a river 
flowing

57
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:10,746
straight into the ocean can get lost 
in a barren place.

58
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:20,650
In the same way this attention, which has 
to go towards the Divine,

59
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:24,949
gets frittered away and is vanished...

60
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:31,473
This weak attention cannot take you towards 
the Divine.

61
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:38,413
Ultimately you find that all this attention 
is being completely

62
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:46,147
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense 
that’s going on.

63
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:51,811
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born 
in these modern times,

64
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:57,163
and in these modern times, as you know, 
it's a very chaotic condition.

65
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:02,364
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know 
what is right and what is wrong.

66
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:07,942
And there are all kinds of attractions,

67
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:17,058
which can take away your attention and 
reduce the energy of your attention.

68
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:25,732
It is possible more for the people who are 
very right-sided.

69
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,691
Also the left-sided people can be very much 
affected.

70
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:35,499
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to 
a point and become extremely dry,

71
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:43,100
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their 
attention is in aggression,

72
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:49,388
while the people who are on the left side 
are indulging too much

73
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:56,987
into their own whims and their desires and 
their own temptations.

74
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:01,336
Both sides can fritter away your attention

75
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:08,304
which is the most important thing. It is 
the most valuable thing is your attention.

76
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:13,133
But the attention cannot be controlled by 
a person

77
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:21,045
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak 
heart.

78
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:26,021
Now supposing you take somebody who is 
a very intelligent person.

79
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:30,262
The intelligent person puts all his 
attention

80
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,569
in capturing the attention of others.

81
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,447
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of 
a paradox.

82
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:49,596
The person who himself is having such a lot 
of aggressiveness and all that,

83
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:53,966
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very 
nice with people

84
00:10:54,167 --> 00:11:02,701
just to keep good relations or, we can say, 
the good behavior

85
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:07,999
towards people so that they pay attention 
to that person.

86
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,149
This is a very subtle thing. They are not 
even aware about it,

87
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:20,287
that we do such a thing just to make others 
pay attention to us.

88
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:24,091
That is how we have seen that in these 
modern times

89
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:29,980
so many stupid things people do just 
to attract the attention of others.

90
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:38,961
Most of the fads that had come up in modern 
times

91
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:47,297
are just to make something stupid so that 
people should pay attention to them.

92
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:54,482
Of course, the Sahaja Yogis are not like 
that. But I am just pointing it out

93
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:57,762
how, in the modern times, you have to be 
very careful

94
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:04,474
that you should not try to attract 
the attention of others.

95
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:09,857
Instead of that, what you have to do is 
to pay attention to others

96
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:14,378
in a very subtle way, not with any 
expectation

97
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,525
that if you are paying attention to 
somebody,

98
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:21,925
that person should pay attention to you. 
It’s a very big struggle,

99
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:30,244
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people 
try to, say, become very popular

100
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:38,507
or become very outstanding, or something 
of a very great qualities,

101
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,235
to show off that they are something better 
than others.

102
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:48,912
A person who is really in connection with 
the Divine, is least bothered

103
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:54,098
about how people pay attention to that 
person,

104
00:12:54,299 --> 00:13:00,874
but automatically the attention of such 
a person is on others,

105
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:04,289
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

106
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,522
You cannot make out that the attention 
of such a person

107
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:14,721
is on you, but it works and it works 
beautifully.

108
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:20,323
We have to understand that we have now come 
to the realm of the Divinity.

109
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:25,420
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are 
divine people.

110
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:29,939
We are very powerful people, but if we 
fritter away

111
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,899
our attention, we become very, very weak 
people.

112
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,896
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja 
Yogis”, “we have done

113
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:46,173
so much of realisation of others” or 
“we have helped so many people.”

114
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:50,233
All this consciousness if it comes within 
you, then know

115
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:54,563
that you are still not fully developed 
Sahaja Yogis.

116
00:13:54,764 --> 00:14:00,660
There should be no consciousness of what 
you are doing or what you are committing.

117
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:08,932
There is no need to boast about it. There 
is no need to advertise it.

118
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:13,450
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen 
by everyone.

119
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:17,398
But even that desire is not needed

120
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,613
because you are doing just for 
the satisfaction of your Spirit.

121
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:28,560
So then, when we come to our heart:

122
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:32,296
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you 
know very well.

123
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:40,208
Now, when it is the heart, which has 
to work over your brain and which can work,

124
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:45,068
what becomes of you is nothing, but you 
become a source

125
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,626
of love and compassion. A source, I am 
saying.

126
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:54,496
You do not assert on others. You do not say 
that, “I’ve done so much for you

127
00:14:54,697 --> 00:15:03,860
and what are you doing to me? What is this 
that I should have so much expressed,

128
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:06,848
in so many ways, and here you are,

129
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:11,425
you are forgetting me and not doing 
anything for me?”

130
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:17,131
So the expectation of reward if it is 
there,

131
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:21,583
then you must know is your mind which is 
giving you these ideas

132
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:28,373
and is working it out that way that you 
just now put attention

133
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:32,306
to the amount of love the other person 
has given you

134
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:39,907
for whatever you have given to another 
person. It's very subtle.

135
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:49,071
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now 
yourself as just a source of love,

136
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:53,212
which is just flowing.

137
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:58,767
In that, you do not say that you have 
to have this or that,

138
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:06,358
or you have to achieve this goal, or you 
have to become that. It's finished now.

139
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:13,434
Once you have become the source, then how 
can you become something?

140
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:19,653
The thing is, those who are receiving from 
the source want to have

141
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:31,614
some sort of a reward or some sort of 
a recognition.

142
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:38,025
In this subtle way if you move, your mind 
is very clever.

143
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:43,152
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever, 
intelligent people.

144
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:50,978
But this mind... You have to be very 
careful because this mind can cheat you.

145
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:57,591
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja 
Yoga?

146
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:02,357
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

147
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:11,961
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then, 
you have to ask yourself that,

148
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:20,486
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

149
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:27,290
What do I want to achieve? Why I am 
in Sahaja Yoga?"

150
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:32,215
If you ask this question, you will see 
you’ll just dissolve,

151
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:37,697
you'll become thoughtless because there is 
no desire left now.

152
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,585
There is no ambition left, no competition.

153
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:47,033
All these qualities are of the brain, or we 
can say, of the intellect,

154
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:52,643
which makes you competitive, which makes 
you also jealous.

155
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:56,894
So jealousy is also a product of this 
competitiveness

156
00:17:57,095 --> 00:18:01,673
because when two persons are competing 
or many are competing

157
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:05,881
and one is selected, others become jealous.

158
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:11,884
I mean, instead of feeling happy, "All 
right. So, one of us has become something,

159
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:14,342
so we should be very happy that he has 
become."

160
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:19,953
On the contrary, the other people feel 
jealous, "Why has he become?

161
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:24,350
Who is he? What does he think of himself?" 
Then they go further.

162
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:29,204
Not you people, but on the whole, people 
go further with it

163
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:34,778
and what do they do is to harm another 
person.

164
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,927
In Sahaja Yoga, people are also sometimes 
very worried and frightened.

165
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:43,989
There is no need to be worried or 
frightened

166
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:51,328
because now you have become a Sahaja 
Yogi and a Guru. Nobody can touch you.

167
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:57,578
Anybody who tries to touch you will be 
subsided, somehow or other.

168
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:03,859
Of course, I don't do anything as such. 
But today only I heard that in Turkey

169
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,520
there were two newspapers who were after 
Sahaja Yoga, writing all nonsensical things.

170
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:17,649
So, the first one met with an accident and 
died. I didn't do that.

171
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,075
The second one had two people, editor 
and sub-editor,

172
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:28,982
were killed and somebody cut their throats. 
Of course, I didn't do that.

173
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:31,915
Some fundamentalist must have done, or 
somebody must have done.

174
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:37,189
Now, we don't have to worry as to who 
criticizes you, they say it about you

175
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,164
because you must know they are blind 
people.

176
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:46,310
They are absolutely blind, they are not 
matured as far as the wisdom is concerned.

177
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:50,326
For them to understand Sahaja Yoga is not 
possible.

178
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:53,884
They go up to a point and then they stop. 
They cannot go further

179
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:57,124
because this dissolution of your being,

180
00:19:57,325 --> 00:20:03,506
as I said, “the drop becomes the ocean”.

181
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:08,859
It's difficult, specially in the West, 
where there are so many ideas

182
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:17,034
of their own identifications and of their 
own personalities.

183
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:24,737
Now, it is quite, again, a paradox that we 
don’t want people

184
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:31,797
to dress up indecently or we don’t want 
people to behave indecently.

185
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:36,515
Decency is a very big part of Sahaja Yoga.

186
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:41,957
So one can ask that, "Mother, when you say 
you have to completely dissolve,

187
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,260
then why should we have this dignity?

188
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:48,878
Why should we worry about having 
the dignity?" It's quite all right.

189
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,289
This question is all right. The answer is 
like this:

190
00:20:52,490 --> 00:21:05,043
Supposing, you put a drop of some filth in 
the ocean, then the ocean can become dirty.

191
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:10,429
If you put some poison, then the whole 
ocean can become poisonous.

192
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:17,397
In the same way, whatever is not congenial 
to the ocean,

193
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:22,033
to this Divine power, should not be done.

194
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:28,569
Otherwise, you will spoil the whole of it. 
We have had experiences.

195
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,690
We have had Sahaja Yogis who were leaders 
also,

196
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:38,698
and they tried to be quite funny and 
the whole collectivity was spoilt.

197
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:45,073
One person who is not a good person can 
spoil the whole collectivity.

198
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:52,379
The one who is then a leader, on top 
of that, is even worse.

199
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,550
So, one has to understand that, when you 
are becoming a drop of the ocean,

200
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:04,423
this ocean is the pure ocean of love.

201
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:10,543
In that you should not do something that 
will create repulsion, frustration,

202
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:20,157
or even sometimes it can create a very 
grotesque image of the whole ocean.

203
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:25,102
That is why we have to be decent people, 
decorous people.

204
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:32,455
It is not that in any way we want you to be 
like a dandy people or anything,

205
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:38,014
but what it means that you must respect 
your body, respect yourself

206
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:42,386
and a respectable personality you should 
have.

207
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:45,599
Too much indulgence to that is not proper,

208
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,113
but it should be such that you should 
respect yourself.

209
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:53,770
It's very important. If you cannot respect 
yourself

210
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:59,978
you cannot respect at all the Divinity 
within you.

211
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:06,062
It's like a decoration of the Divinity that 
your whole behavior,

212
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:11,100
your whole attire has to be in such a way 
that people should know

213
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:14,106
that he is a decent man.

214
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:20,926
Indecent things have come out and have 
become now an everyday fashion.

215
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:24,842
And they go on coming one after another 
because of the entrepreneurs,

216
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:27,401
and we are playing into the hands 
of entrepreneurs.

217
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:30,623
But if you know what dress you have to wear

218
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:34,496
and what is good for you, once for all you 
have to decide.

219
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:38,030
Now the attention should not be also wasted

220
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:41,380
in that, "I will today, I'll wear this kind 
of a sari,

221
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:44,561
tomorrow I’ll wear that kind of a dress, 
third day…",

222
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:49,930
because that also spoils the attention. 
But if it is a decent thing,

223
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:53,690
it's perfectly alright, and that will 
really make you feel

224
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,395
dignified within yourself.

225
00:23:57,596 --> 00:24:00,378
In modern times, as the people are, I don't 
think

226
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:03,998
they have much respect for themselves.

227
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:08,133
You see very highly posted people, highly 
placed people

228
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:12,287
doing all kinds of nonsensical things like 
cheating,

229
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:23,044
like having relations with people who are 
of dishonorable position.

230
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,329
All this is happening. If you see 
in the newspaper, you are shocked

231
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,677
how these people at the helm of affairs 
could be like this.

232
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:35,768
Because they are still not matured enough 
to know where are they,

233
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:38,765
what is their position, how they have 
to be.

234
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:43,197
If you are matured enough then you will 
understand that, say, I’m a housewife,

235
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:48,373
I’m such a minister, I’m prime-minister, 
how I should be.

236
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:54,381
That all that achievement they have outside 
remains outside, doesn't go inside.

237
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:58,401
But for a Sahaja Yogi it should be absorbed 
within.

238
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:06,200
It has to be absorbed within so that 
the attention is not wasted too much.

239
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:13,481
The another part which one has to see is 
the heart.

240
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:22,817
Some people are saying, "Mother, if our 
heart is ruling the head,

241
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:28,092
then we become too much emotional, we get 
too much attached to people,

242
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:36,688
we get, you see, sort of individual 
friendships and things like that."

243
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:42,910
On this point, one has to know that why do 
you get attached to one person?

244
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:49,632
It’s not your heart. It’s not your heart. 
You get attached to a person

245
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:57,634
because you have some sort of a, we can 
say, a relationship, maybe.

246
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:01,882
Or maybe, you like the hair-dress of that 
person.

247
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:06,362
Maybe, you like the dress that person has.

248
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:11,878
Something outside quality is attracting you 
towards that person.

249
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,813
It is not something inner quality that is 
attracting.

250
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:21,540
For example, if you are attached to your 
children too much, you will spoil them.

251
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:26,630
They will not come up to your expectations. 
Anybody you get attached to,

252
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:33,281
you must verify, why are you attached 
to such a person, what is the reason?

253
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:38,894
Now, in Sahaja Yoga people are attached 
to each other very much, I know that.

254
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:44,587
But it is not for any external reason. 
Because somebody is rich,

255
00:26:44,788 --> 00:26:48,204
because somebody is famous, because 
somebody is doing

256
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:53,330
some sort of a extraordinary work. No.

257
00:26:53,531 --> 00:27:02,126
They are attached to that person because 
that person is a bundle of vibrations,

258
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:07,295
that it gives you tranquillity, it gives 
you joy and it gives you

259
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:15,065
a kind of an immense dissolution of your 
being.

260
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:19,350
So, that happens when you are very much 
there,

261
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:25,468
as I have told you the story of once this 
potter

262
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:34,474
was kneading the clay and his name was 
Gorakumhar,

263
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:37,971
and when Namadeva, who was a tailor,

264
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:44,246
but very well known poet, both of them 
were poets, he went and he saw

265
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:51,469
this potter was doing such a, I mean, it was 
not a very respectable work he was doing,

266
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:59,441
he was busy kneading the clay, he looked 
at him and what he says that,

267
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:08,473
"I have come here to see the Chaitanya, 
to see the formless.

268
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:15,725
But what I find that the formless has got 
into a form."

269
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:22,204
This only, I always say, is only possible 
between the two Saints of the same level.

270
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:26,757
That the way they appreciate, that the way 
they feel -

271
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:31,126
there are no words for what I want to say - 
but the way they feel

272
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:37,080
the oneness, the unity, which is a subtle 
one between each other.

273
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:43,954
Such a feeling if you have for each other, 
then know that you are

274
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:48,857
really now dissolved and you are in 
the ocean of joy.

275
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:54,760
But on the contrary, those who are sitting 
on the shores cannot feel that way.

276
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:59,802
They judge, they try to find out what’s 
wrong with that person, this is not so.

277
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:04,652
They can never appreciate another person. 
What they feel is that they have a right

278
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:10,789
to criticize, to find out faults with others 
and that they are something special.

279
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,083
And the other person also finds some faults 
with this person.

280
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:18,682
So it’s a fault-finding society I find 
sometimes. And you get fed up with it.

281
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:24,362
But when you see that the another person 
who is there,

282
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:33,629
the person who is another saint, you feel 
such rapport, such oneness,

283
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:40,116
such a spontaneous feeling for that person 
which is absolutely pure.

284
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:46,668
There’s no expectation, there’s no mental 
activity to find out

285
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:54,259
what’s wrong with that person. There’s no 
judgment about what he, the person is like,

286
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:04,559
but just oneness with that person you feel, 
and you feel that your quality of your love

287
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,423
has got a new shine, a new dimension.

288
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:15,160
So it comes to that, what we should 
appreciate within ourselves

289
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:21,891
is the purity of our love. When you are 
pure, the purity is there,

290
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:30,605
you do not get attached to anything, but 
in that detachment, you are enjoying.

291
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:36,836
In attachment you cannot enjoy because 
in that

292
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:45,559
you are bothered more about the superficial 
relationship with the other person.

293
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,127
Now, in a wider way, if you see Sahaja 
Yoga,

294
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:57,753
you are all very important people - 
extremely important -

295
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:04,758
because in the history of spirituality there 
were not so many saints sitting together.

296
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:09,051
Never can you see so many people from so 
many countries

297
00:31:09,252 --> 00:31:14,998
thinking about Divinity and morality.

298
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:21,701
It is impossible to get so many people 
together, on any point whatsoever,

299
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:28,349
who are feeling the oneness, the...

300
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:36,325
you can say, the most soothing feeling 
with each other.

301
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:42,737
Whether it is comfortable or not,

302
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:53,394
whether it is very much according to 
the norms of comfort,

303
00:31:53,595 --> 00:32:01,772
people who are saints are absolutely happy 
with other saints

304
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:07,972
and other saintly people. They rush 
to people who are saints.

305
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:11,549
Once it happened to Me when I was 
in Kolhapur

306
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,263
that they told Me, “There is a saint who 
talks about You.” “So where is he?”

307
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:20,325
They said, “He lives up there and it will 
take at least three hours

308
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:24,325
for You to climb up. He only lives there, 
he doesn't come out.”

309
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,204
I said, "All right, I would like to go and 
see him."

310
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:32,988
So, I was walking and it started raining.

311
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:36,204
So they said, "Mother, You never go 
to anybody like that,

312
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:42,731
why are You going to him?" I said, "No, 
just I want to go up and see him."

313
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:47,182
Now, this fellow, they said, had a control 
over rain,

314
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:54,674
but it was raining, raining, raining very 
heavily, and when I climbed up

315
00:32:54,875 --> 00:33:00,332
I saw him sitting down and going on like 
this with great anger.

316
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:05,775
So, I said, "Let us go and sit in his cave

317
00:33:05,976 --> 00:33:09,624
because this fellow is now not in a normal 
mood."

318
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:16,963
So, I went and sat in the cave there, and 
there he came. He couldn't walk

319
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:23,313
because his... they say that his legs 
became absolutely lame

320
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:28,097
because of the vibrations that were too 
much in him,

321
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:34,009
whatever it is, he couldn't walk. So, they 
brought him there, he sat down.

322
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:39,933
So, the first thing he asked Me, "Why 
did You not allow me to stop the rain?

323
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:46,252
It was raining so heavily, and when You 
were coming up,

324
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:51,598
I didn’t want You to get drenched the way 
now You are all full of water

325
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:59,128
and I didn’t want You to suffer like this 
because it’s not a good welcome to You.

326
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:05,760
So, did You do it just to control my ego, 
because I must have developed ego

327
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,671
because I can control rain, that's a fact?"

328
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:12,277
So I just smiled at him. I said, "See,

329
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:17,677
you are My son, isn't it? And you have 
bought a sari for Me.

330
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:20,872
But you are a sannyasi, so I can't take 
a sari from you

331
00:34:21,073 --> 00:34:23,119
because sannyasi dharma is different -

332
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,257
I'm a Gruhastha, I can't take a sari from 
you.

333
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:30,785
So, I deliberately got drenched so that you 
could give Me a sari."

334
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:36,609
The whole temper, the whole unnatural 
behavior, all dropped out.

335
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:41,181
He became extremely sweet. "Yes, yes," 
he said, "how do You know I bought a sari?"

336
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:44,162
"At least," I said, "in love you know 
everything."

337
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:50,002
And then he brought a sari for Me and he 
did Aarti and everything.

338
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:57,483
But, you see, all these things show that 
how the love masters everything so easily.

339
00:34:57,684 --> 00:35:05,401
Small, small things, if you are expert 
in expressing your love,

340
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:11,085
how it works out. There are so many 
incidents I can give you like this.

341
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:19,816
But the main thing we have to see within 
ourselves, "Do we really love each other?

342
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:28,189
Do we really have affection and compassion 
for others who are not even Sahaja Yogis?"

343
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,440
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis are also 
the blind people.

344
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:37,888
You should have compassion for them.

345
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:42,521
You should feel that these people are so 
unhappy

346
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:46,229
and they cannot come to Sahaja Yoga

347
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:51,862
and they cannot become Sahaja Yogis, 
and only in their ego they are satisfied.

348
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:55,507
So, you must have real compassion for them.

349
00:35:55,708 --> 00:36:01,491
If you have this compassion you might be 
told by people that,

350
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:06,123
"Why are you wasting your energy, you are 
doing this, you are doing that?"

351
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:12,072
The compassion is actually, unites all 
these things within ourselves.

352
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:16,905
That’s the uniting factor. First is your 
attention,

353
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:22,018
first,  which is very, very important, 
I think.

354
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:27,818
And the second one is your intellect, or 
you can say your mind,

355
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:35,463
and the third one is your heart. They all 
get somehow or other united together

356
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:39,129
once you have this capacity to have 
compassion.

357
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,415
You don't quarrel with Me or anyone, you 
don't have to think about it.

358
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:47,631
You just, you just feel absolutely at home 
when you are compassionate

359
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:52,396
and with this compassion, you are having 
relations with others.

360
00:36:52,597 --> 00:36:59,080
Now, this compassion is not studied out 
or worked out or maneuvered.

361
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:04,952
It is just there. It is there. In that 
compassion it forgives,

362
00:37:05,153 --> 00:37:07,680
it forgets all nonsensical things.

363
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:14,493
The forgiveness is only possible if you 
have this compassion within you.

364
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:17,900
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked 
me,

365
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:21,120
"Mother, how can we have love and 
compassion?"

366
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:26,580
I mean, this is a question which many have 
asked me.

367
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:33,143
Now, the simple thing is that if you 
develop your thoughtless awareness

368
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:37,320
in your meditation, in thoughtless 
awareness,

369
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:41,659
you watch anything in thoughtless 
awareness, any relationship you see it

370
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,781
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be 
amazed

371
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:50,454
how the gates of this compassion will 
open out.

372
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:54,327
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

373
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:58,804
but it doesn't go to one person or 
to another person,

374
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:04,142
but it is throwing lights on all the sides 
of your being.

375
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:13,467
Everybody is benefited, everybody has 
a divine feeling for you.

376
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:22,944
Because this compassion is not linear, 
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

377
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:26,589
and smoothes and soothes everything

378
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:32,654
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and 
that is painful.

379
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,213
This is what you have now.

380
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:38,417
You know, these things were done by saints 
long time back.

381
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:42,270
But then nobody liked them, and they 
crucified them - out of jealousy.

382
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:47,141
Because if somebody became a saint, then 
people felt very jealous of that person.

383
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:51,199
So they killed them or tortured them and 
troubled them.

384
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,327
The situation is not so bad now. Of course, 
there are some useless people.

385
00:38:56,528 --> 00:39:04,634
There are some people who are really 
monsters, I agree. Forget about them.

386
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:11,847
But on the whole, our attitude should be 
that these are blind people.

387
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:16,909
Now, looking at somebody who is, maybe, 
something wrong with that person,

388
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,087
may not be good-natured - may be anything. 
But in your heart

389
00:39:21,288 --> 00:39:27,101
you should not have any grudge, you should 
not have any complaints about them.

390
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:33,068
You can talk to that person about it. You 
can tell him in a way that will be absorbed,

391
00:39:33,269 --> 00:39:38,783
but you should not try to make an issue 
out of it

392
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:42,079
and try to, in any way, trouble or torture 
anyone.

393
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,782
("Can you put off this one?" Hindi: "Put 
off the fan".)

394
00:39:54,688 --> 00:39:59,470
You have seen already, in Sahaja Yoga, 
those people who came and were troublesome

395
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:05,331
and were not of any worth for us, just 
dropped out by themselves.

396
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:07,992
We didn't have to do much about it. They 
just dropped out

397
00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:14,763
and they have gone into some sort of 
a problematic life.

398
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:18,424
I, even now, receive letters from them 
saying that, “We have this problem,

399
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,789
we have that problem and how to solve 
this and solve that."

400
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,762
But it’s automatically happening because, 
after all,

401
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:31,675
there is a big choice going on and 
the Divine s trying to decide

402
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:37,288
who are capable of receiving the blessings 
of the Divine.

403
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:39,922
This is the only thing you have to achieve.

404
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:43,703
That’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga. 
Nothing else is important.

405
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:49,623
There are people who are very highly 
placed, tomorrow they go into dust.

406
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:54,637
There are people who are regarded as very 
great, famous people,

407
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:00,317
they go into dust. It's all the time is 
happening in your presence.

408
00:41:00,518 --> 00:41:05,648
Every day you read a newspaper and you 
find how they are behaving.

409
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:10,731
Like today, somebody told Me that in 
the newspaper there was there

410
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:18,600
that now one bishop is going to discotheque, 
can you imagine? He is going to a disco.

411
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:22,986
Now, what people must be thinking, they 
must be breaking their heads,

412
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:27,635
"Now what to do, this stupid fellow whom 
we call as the bishop and everything,

413
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:31,142
is now going to disco."

414
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:36,209
What they, I mean, all whatever he had 
respect,

415
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,327
maybe it is artificial, but it’s all lost, 
finished.

416
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:47,021
Because you see, as they are, they have 
no value of themselves.

417
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:52,022
They just live with their ego, "I am such 
a big man. I am this, that. I am a bishop."

418
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,967
They walk in a different way, they talk 
in a different way.

419
00:41:55,168 --> 00:41:57,823
And suddenly how they go down.

420
00:41:58,024 --> 00:42:00,103
Now, what was the need for this old Johnny

421
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:03,411
to go to the discotheque, I can’t 
understand?

422
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:10,166
So, because of this kind of life that he 
is leading, thinking no end of himself,

423
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:15,157
he could never see that, “One day I will 
go down like that.”

424
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,208
Another thing, which you should see 
in a very wider way,

425
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:23,420
that he had no feeling why people respected 
him.

426
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:28,549
He never knew why people had respect 
for him.

427
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:35,554
Or he was not conscious of it. At least 
he would have preserved that. He did not.

428
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:42,198
Why should he go to a place about which 
he has been always denouncing

429
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:47,781
and saying that these are bad places, one 
should not go there?

430
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:56,325
So, in your case, you have to be conscious 
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

431
00:42:56,526 --> 00:43:00,345
If you become the ocean doesn't mean that 
your consciousness has vanished,

432
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:05,837
but it has enlarged. You have got 
the consciousness of the ocean.

433
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:11,997
You are not the one who has become like 
a mesmerized person

434
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:17,224
or a person who has no connection with 
oneself.

435
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:22,783
On the contrary, you are connected with 
yourself much more than you were before.

436
00:43:22,984 --> 00:43:26,825
So, when you become the ocean you don't 
loose your personality,

437
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:30,925
but you expand your personality. You become 
a greater person.

438
00:43:31,126 --> 00:43:36,136
And this is happening in Sahaja Yoga. I am 
noticing many people are developing

439
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:42,301
that kind of a personality, and they are 
expressing it and manifesting it.

440
00:43:42,502 --> 00:43:45,295
It gives me great joy to see in My lifetime

441
00:43:45,496 --> 00:43:51,187
I could see such people who are doing this 
kind of thing.

442
00:43:51,568 --> 00:43:56,393
So, whenever you are doing something, 
whatever is your enterprise,

443
00:43:56,594 --> 00:44:01,409
whatever your lifestyle, whatever it is, 
that’s all outside.

444
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:08,913
One should not lose your attention, which 
is towards God Almighty.

445
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:13,433
If that is lost, you are lost. There is 
a very nice poem

446
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:20,946
Namadeva has written about that there 
was a boy who was flying a kite.

447
00:44:21,147 --> 00:44:25,554
And the kite was floating, and this boy was 
looking after the kite.

448
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:31,345
And while he was talking to everybody else, 
but his attention was on the kite.

449
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:37,914
Then it goes further. He says that a lady 
is having the little child

450
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:44,618
on her body, on the waist, and she is 
cleaning the house.

451
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:50,755
She is cleaning with a little broom. She 
has to move

452
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:54,633
from here to there and after that cleaning, 
she has to do other work also.

453
00:44:54,834 --> 00:45:00,138
But the child is here. So, her attention is 
on the child

454
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:03,699
that he should not fall down, something 
should not happen.

455
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,882
Though she is doing all kinds of work, 
everything,

456
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:13,206
her attention is on the child. In the same 
way, your attention should be

457
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:17,580
on your Divine power of Kundalini.

458
00:45:19,472 --> 00:45:23,147
There’s third one he’s described that there 
are many ladies

459
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:27,398
who are taking water from a river.

460
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,152
Sometimes they have three pitchers on their 
heads and walking.

461
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,534
And while they are walking, they are 
talking to each other,

462
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:37,323
they are telling stories about each other 
and anything,

463
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:42,317
but their attention was on the pitchers, 
which are on their head.

464
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:46,134
In the same way, whatever we are doing, 
our attention

465
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:50,063
should be on our Kundalini.

466
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:56,159
We should find out what are we doing. 
As it is we have the light.

467
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:02,294
But you must take light into every corner 
of your life,

468
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:11,337
every aspect of your thinking, every kind 
of an effort you make.

469
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:15,774
And you’ll be amazed, if you really watch 
your attention

470
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:19,104
you will really know what you are doing.

471
00:46:19,305 --> 00:46:22,263
It’s the attention to be watched so much

472
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:31,140
that ultimately you’ll be surprised that 
the attention is no more frittering away.

473
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:35,749
Without the attention you cannot work out 
Sahaja Yoga.

474
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:42,482
This is the main problem of Sahaja Yoga, 
is that your attention has to be

475
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:47,755
towards God Almighty. Otherwise, nothing 
can work out.

476
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:51,289
Your ascent cannot work out. Hah, if you 
have come to Sahaja Yoga

477
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:54,306
to make money, all right, you will make 
money and get out.

478
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:57,658
If you have come here to show off your 
knowledge and all that,

479
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:01,861
you will show it and get out. If you have 
come here to show

480
00:47:02,062 --> 00:47:08,029
your power and your authority, you stay 
there and get out.

481
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,844
Like that many people have gone out if you 
know.

482
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:17,727
And this is what is to be really taken 
care of: that you don’t try

483
00:47:17,928 --> 00:47:21,785
to use Sahaja Yoga for all these stupid 
things,

484
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:29,240
which are not permanent, which are not 
eternal. Sahaja Yoga is to be used just

485
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:37,775
for cleansing yourself, for becoming 
the ocean, the ocean of love.

486
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:45,199
Now, many people also feel that love is 
rather difficult,

487
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:52,623
because you can be harmed by others, or 
somebody can take advantage of you.

488
00:47:52,824 --> 00:48:00,334
The main thing about love is, if it is not 
a pure love, then it creates problems.

489
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:03,234
Supposing you trust somebody because 
of money,

490
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:05,804
trust somebody because of somebody… 
relationship

491
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:08,685
or anything, and you go on indulging 
into it,

492
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:15,281
ultimately you’ll find that you will be 
very disappointed. Very disappointed.

493
00:48:15,482 --> 00:48:23,885
But supposing you show your love, just 
with purity about that person...

494
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:33,985
It’s so subtle. It’s so innate within you, 
built in. It’s there.

495
00:48:34,186 --> 00:48:41,349
We have to just open out. Every human being 
is a bundle of love.

496
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:45,157
And when he is afraid of others - specially 
in the West,

497
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:47,334
there is so many ideas they have created

498
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:52,756
that you are afraid of this kind of love 
and that kind of love and

499
00:48:52,957 --> 00:48:56,638
you see the way the perversion and 
all nonsense is there.

500
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:03,889
But in pure love there is a kind of 
a beautiful light

501
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:11,533
which protects you, which guides you and 
which enlightens your life completely.

502
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:23,161
This light is just nourished and also, we 
can say, like the lamp has to have the oil,

503
00:49:23,362 --> 00:49:30,558
this is the one that is for our 
spirituality: the Love of a person.

504
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:35,472
You are embodiment of love, take it from 
Me, because you are a human being.

505
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:39,559
Even the animals are there who know what 
is love is.

506
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,868
You see… I know that if you love a tiger, 
the tiger will never harm.

507
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:49,744
If you love a snake, it will never harm.

508
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:56,220
If you try to love anybody who is very 
cruel and very bad,

509
00:49:56,421 --> 00:50:02,380
gradually he will calm down. He will harm 
you little bit, he will do this,

510
00:50:02,581 --> 00:50:07,241
he will see things and he might be mean 
with you, do all kinds of things.

511
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:11,581
But then, gradually you find your love 
works, and works, and works.

512
00:50:11,782 --> 00:50:17,400
And ultimately it is your love, which is 
important to that person.

513
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:23,547
Now, your love is really firstly 
appreciated

514
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:29,408
more by innocent people, like children. 
Children know what love is.

515
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:36,702
If the children see you, and they run away, 
that means something wrong with you.

516
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:41,384
I’ve seen people… like once we were 
in Japan

517
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:45,932
and there were two foreigners who were 
there, ladies, who were dressed up -

518
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,901
I don't know from which hair-dresser they 
had dressed up themselves

519
00:50:49,102 --> 00:50:55,714
and they were very much overly decorated - 
and they came with us, you see.

520
00:50:55,915 --> 00:51:03,978
We climbed up a place to see something 
and when we came down

521
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:09,697
there were some children standing there. 
They had gone before us. So they said,

522
00:51:09,898 --> 00:51:14,194
"Where are those witches?” I said, “Which?” 
“Which went with you?"

523
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:17,631
I said, "What do you mean?" "They came, 
you know, we were frightened,

524
00:51:17,832 --> 00:51:21,873
we ran away to our houses. Now we have 
come to tell you they are witches."

525
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:24,669
These small, small little Japanese 
children, you know,

526
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,503
"They are witches, you know, they are 
witches. Be afraid of them."

527
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:31,999
And they had decorated themselves so much, 
so much hair-dressed up.

528
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,958
They have tried to make such a beautiful 
show of themselves,

529
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,912
but the… for the children, they were 
witches and they ran away.

530
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:43,249
And when we came, they came running and 
telling us, “Don't be with them,

531
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,991
they're witches.”

532
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:51,019
So, the judgment of the innocent people 
is the best judgment.

533
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:55,482
If they are innocent, they are extremely 
well equipped

534
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:59,525
to judge a person - who has love and who 
does not have.

535
00:51:59,726 --> 00:52:04,210
And they are the best people because they 
will appreciate you the best.

536
00:52:04,411 --> 00:52:08,580
They will understand that these are people 
of some high quality.

537
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:15,728
But if they are not innocent, cunning, 
some people are extremely cunning -

538
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:19,622
that’s the intelligence part of it - they 
can never appreciate you.

539
00:52:19,823 --> 00:52:27,092
They'll appreciate something which is, 
something very, very abnormal,

540
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:33,452
which from divine part, divine angle,

541
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:42,817
is very, very abtuse and funny. But they 
will never appreciate you.

542
00:52:43,018 --> 00:52:46,016
Never, cannot. Up to a point they may, 
but may not.

543
00:52:46,217 --> 00:52:50,704
Doesn't matter. You have to appreciate 
yourself.

544
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:56,979
You have to know that you are not unkind 
to anyone, you are not judging others,

545
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:03,642
and that you are appreciating everything 
in that person -

546
00:53:03,843 --> 00:53:09,004
whatever is good in him as a human being. 
It works.

547
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:13,700
You have seen, this all has worked through 
My love and compassion.

548
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:19,006
But I’m not conscious that I’m giving you 
love or compassion or anything.

549
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:22,086
I’m not conscious even that I am giving you 
anything.

550
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:30,088
I’m not even conscious as to… I have 
created such a lot of beautiful people.

551
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:33,315
I am not conscious of that. It’s just 
happening.

552
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:36,879
Just like this tree is here, see, it is 
not conscious

553
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:42,902
as to what it is and what it looks like. 
It’s just is there.

554
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:48,693
In the same way, if it happens to you, 
I tell you, you become really

555
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:54,175
the source of such a joy for everyone.

556
00:53:54,376 --> 00:54:00,095
Now, what do we have to do for this world? 
What is needed to be done for this world?

557
00:54:00,296 --> 00:54:03,880
People talk of peace, this, that. There’s 
no need to do anything.

558
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:08,655
It just… you become a personality of that 
kind -

559
00:54:08,856 --> 00:54:14,652
you emit peace, you emit love, you emit joy 
to others.

560
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:18,771
Now, this power is within you because it is 
built-in, it's within you.

561
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:24,803
It is in a potential form in every person. 
Only thing, it has to be brought out.

562
00:54:25,004 --> 00:54:37,871
Now, with affection, you may not, but with 
love and feeling that is innate within you.

563
00:54:38,072 --> 00:54:42,831
Because there are no words for such subtle 
things that are within yourself.

564
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:46,135
Because so far people don’t know what are 
these things

565
00:54:46,336 --> 00:54:50,287
that make you feel oneness with others.

566
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:58,281
All this, all this can happen to you very 
easily, very easily,

567
00:54:58,482 --> 00:55:05,369
when you understand that you are not this 
mind, you are not this body,

568
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:11,299
you are not this attention - you are 
the Spirit.

569
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:17,198
Then you introspect, "Am I the Spirit? 
All right, if I am the Spirit,

570
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:20,856
what is… what am I doing?"

571
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:27,266
Once you become the Spirit, then you feel, 
"Why not others?"

572
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:31,773
Out of love and compassion. Not for 
becoming some leaders or anything.

573
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:36,198
Just out of love. "If I am that why not 
make others like that?"

574
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,266
And that is how Sahaja Yoga has spread 
so much,

575
00:55:39,467 --> 00:55:43,561
and we have such gems of people, such 
beautiful people

576
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:49,456
that I really never expected so much 
to happen in My lifetime.

577
00:55:49,657 --> 00:55:54,830
It has never happened with any saint, any 
incarnation, any prophet.

578
00:55:55,031 --> 00:55:59,456
So now, you people have become absolutely

579
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:04,364
‘Khalis’ means absolutely you have vacated 
yourself fully.

580
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:08,116
The story of Radha and Krishna is very 
beautiful

581
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:14,984
where Radha said that, "Why do You take 
this...

582
00:56:20,497 --> 00:56:22,644
[Hindi: "I don’t know the English word 
for Murli’"],

583
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:26,389
flute... to Your throat? Why do You take 
this?"

584
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:30,287
Because Murli is such a sweet thing, ‘na’, 
flute is not so sweet.

585
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:34,757
"But why do You take this flute to Your 
lips?"

586
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:39,916
After all… She, She must have been jealous, 
I think so.

587
00:56:40,602 --> 00:56:46,919
So, it's a story, just a story. So, He 
said, "Why not go and ask the flute?"

588
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,561
So, flute She went and asked, "Why 
Shri Krishna

589
00:56:50,762 --> 00:56:54,338
takes you to His lips all the time?"

590
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:58,340
So, he said, she said, "You know,

591
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:03,634
I have become completely hollow. There’s 
nothing in me.

592
00:57:03,835 --> 00:57:11,101
He puts me to His lips and people say 
that I am playing the tune.

593
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:17,127
It’s He who is playing the tune. Where 
am I? I’m not there.

594
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:22,409
I’m just enjoying the same tune, which is 
passing through me.

595
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:28,975
That is the expression." But then Radha 
told Shri Krishna,

596
00:57:29,176 --> 00:57:33,193
"Why don't You make (me) the same way 
as the flute?"

597
00:57:33,394 --> 00:57:38,764
So, this is what you have to be, the flute, 
means you have to be hollow within yourself.

598
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:45,856
All these little, little things, you know, 
which come into your life are not important.

599
00:57:46,057 --> 00:57:51,867
What is important is - have you become 
completely hollow?

600
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:55,853
This is where, I would say, introspection 
will help.

601
00:57:56,054 --> 00:58:01,099
The one who makes the flute is also within 
you.

602
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:08,651
So let there be a flute made out of you 
by yourself only.

603
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:15,296
This is the way you make yourself what you 
have to become.

604
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:20,267
In Gita Shri Krishna has said, "Atmaneva 
Atmane Shrushta",

605
00:58:20,468 --> 00:58:24,090
means the Spirit gets satisfied by itself.

606
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:27,934
Isn't it very difficult thing to 
understand -

607
00:58:28,135 --> 00:58:31,632
how can the Spirit be satisfied by itself?

608
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,806
But now you can understand what 
Shri Krishna has said

609
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:40,880
that your own Spirit becomes satisfied with 
itself.

610
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:44,229
Then it doesn't require any other 
satisfaction.

611
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,533
You seek the comfort of your Spirit, you 
seek the joy of your Spirit,

612
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,861
you seek the beauty of your Spirit.

613
00:58:52,062 --> 00:59:01,751
You don't even seek, but it is in itself 
is filled with that joy of the Spirit

614
00:59:01,952 --> 00:59:07,234
and it only can be satisfied by itself.

615
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:10,400
There are many people who say, "I am not 
satisfied, you see,

616
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:15,720
this I am not very much satisfied, it is 
not that I am satisfied."

617
00:59:16,144 --> 00:59:22,116
In the same way, the Spirit can say, 
"I am not satisfied."

618
00:59:22,317 --> 00:59:28,240
But the Spirit can be satisfied with Spirit 
only.

619
00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:33,760
It’s like the reflection in the mirror. 
When you look at the mirror you see there

620
00:59:34,057 --> 00:59:39,154
your own reflection. Now, if the mirror is 
not all right, I will say,

621
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:43,080
"I am not satisfied with what reflection 
we are getting out of this mirror."

622
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:45,879
So you’ll change the mirror, you’ll bring 
the better mirror,

623
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,914
you'll try to get a better picture 
of yourself. In the same way,

624
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:57,795
the Spirit which is reflected within you, 
wants to see its own image.

625
00:59:57,996 --> 01:00:03,468
And then what you do is to… you go on, 
somehow or other,

626
01:00:03,669 --> 01:00:11,065
changing, cleaning, making it all right 
through your meditation

627
01:00:11,266 --> 01:00:15,903
so that your Spirit is satisfied with 
the Spirit.

628
01:00:16,104 --> 01:00:20,112
Shri Krishna wrote Gita in such a ambiguous 
manner because He was very clever.

629
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:22,459
He knew human beings cannot take things 
straight,

630
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,640
so tell them this way, that way, that way,

631
01:00:24,841 --> 01:00:29,216
so that they’ll run around and then 
ultimately they will come to Truth.

632
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:34,330
But Truth is very simple. Truth is 
extremely simple.

633
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:38,076
You don't have to go here and there and 
you don't have to stand on your legs

634
01:00:38,277 --> 01:00:43,591
or feet all the time. You don't have 
to fight with anything.

635
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:50,525
You don't have to take to some sort of 
a ‘tapasya’, abstinence - nothing.

636
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:59,447
Only just you become like a flute. You 
become hollow.

637
01:00:59,648 --> 01:01:03,728
It’s not difficult. It’s not difficult 
at all for Sahaja Yogis

638
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:08,311
because already the Kundalini has made 
you hollow. It’s not difficult.

639
01:01:08,512 --> 01:01:15,211
But still, I find people deviate. Their 
attention goes here and there.

640
01:01:15,412 --> 01:01:18,401
So many people have told Me how their 
problems were solved

641
01:01:18,602 --> 01:01:22,457
without doing anything about it. I said, 
"What did you do?"

642
01:01:22,658 --> 01:01:27,672
"No, Mother, we just put it at Your lotus 
feet." I said, "Really?"

643
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:32,303
"Yes, that's all. Or we were just looking 
at the problem, what the problem is.

644
01:01:32,504 --> 01:01:37,449
We were standing outside and looking 
at the problem and the problem got solved."

645
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:41,255
Even the most difficult problems that you 
think, can be solved

646
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:49,072
very easily because you have powers. Your 
powers are great.

647
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:54,204
You are saints, but more than saints,

648
01:01:54,651 --> 01:02:00,787
much more than saints because you are born 
at such a volatile times.

649
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:06,753
Like supposing, you have a light in 
darkness, you are finding something,

650
01:02:06,954 --> 01:02:10,717
you bump into that and you bump into that.

651
01:02:10,918 --> 01:02:16,765
But supposing, this is a place full of gas,

652
01:02:17,146 --> 01:02:24,601
you bring one light, the whole thing becomes 
enlightened. Like that you have powers.

653
01:02:24,802 --> 01:02:33,373
But you must get out of this nonsense 
of "me", "my" and "mine".

654
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:38,553
I don't know how to say you get out - 
It’s not like a swimming pool,

655
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:42,287
that you jump into it and get out. It’s not 
like that.

656
01:02:42,488 --> 01:02:50,920
It is another kind of a very subtle 
understanding that our roots have to grow.

657
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:54,678
And for growing our roots, we have to go 
within ourselves

658
01:02:54,879 --> 01:03:03,123
and find out within ourselves what is 
the area we are occupying,

659
01:03:03,324 --> 01:03:10,961
in what areas in our lifestyle we are 
taking these roots inside.

660
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:17,564
Also, Shri Krishna has said that the tree 
of life has the roots in the brain

661
01:03:17,765 --> 01:03:21,300
and grows downward. It’s very interesting 
to understand

662
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:24,983
that the roots are growing in the brain.

663
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:33,311
That means, your own intellect is just 
covered with compassion,

664
01:03:33,512 --> 01:03:44,769
it’s just being absolutely one with 
compassion.

665
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,907
I had told you a story about a saint

666
01:03:48,108 --> 01:03:52,595
who was to take to… water for the Deity 
n Gujarat

667
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:59,852
and he walked one month to go there with 
a pitcher of water.

668
01:04:00,053 --> 01:04:07,940
And then at the… because it was a very 
high mountain on which this Deity was,

669
01:04:08,141 --> 01:04:13,660
and he reached at the foothill.

670
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:18,999
There he found a little donkey dying 
of thirst

671
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,679
so he poured all the water for that donkey.

672
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,449
So those who were with him, they asked, 
"What are you doing?

673
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:30,366
You brought it all the way, and why are 
you putting it for this donkey?"

674
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:31,535
He said, "You don't know?

675
01:04:31,736 --> 01:04:35,645
The God has come all the way down, just 
to meet me here.

676
01:04:35,846 --> 01:04:37,941
He doesn't want me to climb up."

677
01:04:38,142 --> 01:04:46,378
This kind of an absolutely simple 
understanding

678
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:54,345
of another's feelings and another's 
problems:

679
01:04:54,546 --> 01:04:58,812
you can solve them, you can sort them out.

680
01:04:59,013 --> 01:05:01,934
And the person will tell you that, "You 
sorted out my problem."

681
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:08,003
But you will not know how you have solved 
because this love is the power.

682
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:11,885
This love can see things. It is everything.

683
01:05:12,086 --> 01:05:15,931
It’s like a… you see a television, 
all right, it’s a television.

684
01:05:16,132 --> 01:05:18,555
If you see a telephone, it's a telephone.

685
01:05:18,756 --> 01:05:27,243
If you see anything you do with the power, 
it’s all is embodied inside this love.

686
01:05:27,444 --> 01:05:32,033
You need not have to telephone. I never 
telephone to anyone.

687
01:05:32,234 --> 01:05:35,704
Mostly I never telephone. I mean, if 
somebody forces Me then it’s all right.

688
01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:39,051
I never telephone. But not to save 
the bill,

689
01:05:39,252 --> 01:05:43,612
but I do not telephone because there is 
no need.

690
01:05:43,813 --> 01:05:47,925
The whole subtle of the ether is at your 
feet.

691
01:05:48,126 --> 01:05:54,576
Just you want to do something you can just 
do it, just with the vibrations.

692
01:05:54,777 --> 01:05:59,794
Now, many people say, "Mother, cure this 
person, cure that person." There’s no need.

693
01:05:59,995 --> 01:06:05,706
You all can cure, you are so many. You can 
cure anyone you want to,

694
01:06:05,907 --> 01:06:09,222
but you bring that person to Me. It’s not 
needed.

695
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:12,142
Just you can cure anybody you feel like.

696
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:18,551
You can solve all their problems yourself. 
One little Bandhan can solve it.

697
01:06:18,752 --> 01:06:22,319
But for that you should be the source 
of love.

698
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:31,148
Once you give a Bandhan, the… this powerful 
love takes over,

699
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:34,792
"All right, I'll do the job."

700
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:40,586
But for that you have to be the master 
of this beautiful thing.

701
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:45,644
Now, one thing is very different from other 
masteries.

702
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:49,400
In other masteries, you see people try 
to dominate

703
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:54,820
or to, try to use it for destroying others.

704
01:06:55,021 --> 01:07:03,835
But the mastery of love is that you know 
how to build

705
01:07:04,805 --> 01:07:13,366
a rapport with the Divine love. And this 
Divine love is not only powerful,

706
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:24,830
but it is such a efficient, I should say, 
such an alert instrument

707
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:28,127
which works out everything in such a manner

708
01:07:28,328 --> 01:07:33,091
that you are amazed how things have worked 
out.

709
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:36,946
And everybody has noticed it. I know you 
all know it.

710
01:07:37,147 --> 01:07:39,644
Not that you don't know, but you don't use.

711
01:07:39,845 --> 01:07:44,404
You have to be on the vibratory awareness 
and use that.

712
01:07:44,605 --> 01:07:48,519
Even giving yourself is a Bandhan itself 
clarifies you.

713
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:55,855
Imagine in your hand there is this great 
power of giving you this balance,

714
01:07:56,056 --> 01:08:00,261
this love, this affection and all 
the protection

715
01:08:00,462 --> 01:08:04,951
while you can give it to others also. You 
have become now

716
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:10,291
the part and parcel of the Divine power. 
You are now in the Kingdom of God.

717
01:08:10,492 --> 01:08:15,169
And whatever you want to do can be done 
by this divine power.

718
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:20,404
With all this telling you I still feel, 
sometimes, you are not confident.

719
01:08:20,605 --> 01:08:26,861
You get upset. You feel that, "How can 
this be?"

720
01:08:27,062 --> 01:08:30,722
You have no trust in yourself, you have no 
faith in yourself.

721
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:38,089
And also there are some people, sort of, 
who feel they are neglected,

722
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:42,152
or something should have happened to them.

723
01:08:42,353 --> 01:08:47,515
Once a lady started crying. So, I said, 
"Why is she crying?"

724
01:08:47,716 --> 01:08:52,720
She said, "Because Mother didn't smile 
at me." I didn’t smile at her?

725
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:58,345
But I never smiled at anyone. I don't know 
why she thinks like that.

726
01:08:58,546 --> 01:09:04,834
So, I asked her, "Why do you want Me 
to smile at you? What's wrong with you?

727
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:08,122
You are all right? Why should I smile 
at you?"

728
01:09:08,323 --> 01:09:11,124
So, you see, also this kind of a feeling

729
01:09:11,325 --> 01:09:14,472
that comes up sometimes that in Sahaja 
Yoga,

730
01:09:14,673 --> 01:09:19,649
Mother should all the time be only attached 
to you.

731
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,406
She cannot get attached, you know. 
It’s a helpless condition I have.

732
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:29,219
There are so many, you don't know, defects 
I have, which you have no idea.

733
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,295
I don't know how to count money.

734
01:09:31,496 --> 01:09:34,665
If I… give Me hundred rupees I’ll count it 
two hundred rupees.

735
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:37,211
You see, I don't know many things. I don't 
know banking;

736
01:09:37,412 --> 01:09:41,033
I don't know many things and one of them 
is I don't know

737
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:47,181
how to put attention to this person or 
to that person. Like politicians would do -

738
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:52,026
"You see, ah, you must look after this man, 
because he is very important." Nothing.

739
01:09:52,227 --> 01:09:57,807
To Me you are just part and parcel of Me, 
finished, nothing more than that.

740
01:09:58,008 --> 01:10:03,849
So, you see, everybody so should know that 
you are very close to My heart,

741
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:08,711
you are very much there, I am very proud 
of you. And something,

742
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:14,685
really it’s a miracle that has happened, 
that you people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

743
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:19,784
So on that point also, that how much Mother 
cares for me, what She does...

744
01:10:19,985 --> 01:10:22,582
Now supposing, I tell somebody, "All right, 
you don't sit here, sit there,"

745
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:26,264
they feel bad. Anything you do, they feel 
bad.

746
01:10:26,465 --> 01:10:32,152
This kind of a person has no sense of love. 
He doesn't understand Mother's love.

747
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:35,132
So, at the end of the whole thing I must 
tell you,

748
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:39,916
that when you are a guru, you are also 
a mother.

749
01:10:40,117 --> 01:10:46,087
You have to express yourself like a mother. 
She is kind, she is gentle, she forgives.

750
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:50,730
She also corrects whenever it’s necessary, 
but in her own sweet way she corrects

751
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:55,479
so the correction takes place - it's not 
that a rebellion starts.

752
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:02,260
So all that wisdom of a mother is within 
you, is already there, so please try to use.

753
01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:08,489
I am sure, it will all work out and as it 
is we are a very beautiful group of people

754
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:19,820
who are something out of the blue, who are 
so much in peace and in joy together.

755
01:11:20,021 --> 01:11:23,288
May God bless you all.

756
01:11:32,786 --> 01:11:37,172
So, today's Guru Puja will be... Of course, 
we can -

757
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:40,986
we can have a little of Ganesha's Atharva 
Sheersha,

758
01:11:41,187 --> 01:11:44,425
but Devi Puja will be much less.

759
01:11:44,626 --> 01:11:50,628
And for Guru Puja I would request 
the country leaders to come up.

760
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:55,539
Country leaders have to come up. So it is 
in a different way,

761
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:59,635
we can say that the main thing is 
the Guru Puja

762
01:11:59,836 --> 01:12:02,295
where the country leaders have to come up.

763
01:12:02,496 --> 01:12:08,565
The Devi Puja will be followed after that, 
which is very short.

764
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,523
(Hindi: "Please, change this tea.")
