13:41.040 --> 13:45.800
Today is a very great day I must say,

13:46.760 --> 13:53.680
to celebrate Sahasrara, the puja of Sahasrara.

13:55.800 --> 14:02.040
It’s a very unique thing that has happened,

14:02.920 --> 14:07.240
that your Sahasraras were opened out.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.240
There were some very few people in this whole world;

14:14.560 --> 14:19.760
there were some Sufis, there were some saints,

14:19.999 --> 14:23.360
some other people also in China and all.

14:23.680 --> 14:30.680
But very few, very few got their Sahasrara opened out.

14:31.400 --> 14:38.080
So whatever they said or written was never understood

14:38.320 --> 14:40.080
by the people.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.960
They actually tortured them, they crucified them

14:46.160 --> 14:49.040
and did all kinds of horrible things,

14:49.320 --> 14:56.080
because they couldn’t bear somebody getting this realization.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.720
So it’s a very great day

14:58.800 --> 15:05.560
because collectively this Sahasrara has been opened.

15:07.040 --> 15:11.280
Every one of you have got it.

15:11.520 --> 15:15.960
Also all over the world you have many people

15:15.960 --> 15:20.280
who have got their Sahasraras open.

15:21.560 --> 15:26.000
Of course we need many more, for them to understand

15:26.120 --> 15:33.280
what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrara.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.640
Some have grown very much

15:36.240 --> 15:39.200
after getting their realization, very much.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.240
They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well

15:44.440 --> 15:46.760
and they have developed their depth

15:46.960 --> 15:49.640
and their consciousness

15:49.840 --> 15:56.160
is really a great awareness of oneness with the Divine.

15:56.560 --> 16:01.800
To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.

16:02.600 --> 16:08.960
So far they were human beings at a lower level of existence,

16:09.720 --> 16:13.480
and they had all the problems of that level,

16:13.560 --> 16:17.999
is that jealousies, hatred-

16:19.080 --> 16:23.080
all kinds of problems that are today of fighting,

16:23.520 --> 16:25.800
of troubling others,

16:26.000 --> 16:30.480
destroying others and not loving others.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.520
All these problems existed because

16:33.800 --> 16:36.480
their Sahasrara was not opened.

16:38.120 --> 16:43.920
So our main problem is

16:44.120 --> 16:48.880
to open the Sahasrara of the people all over the world-

16:49.360 --> 16:53.920
which is very simple, which you can all do it,

16:54.240 --> 16:57.640
and it will work better if you do it collectively.

16:57.960 --> 17:03.120
If you are collective you can work it out very well.

17:03.800 --> 17:07.200
Like that in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come

17:07.680 --> 17:10.360
whose Sahasrara was completely opened,

17:10.840 --> 17:12.880
and they felt their depth.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.600
Firstly, you must feel your depth.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.600
If you don’t feel your depth

17:18.800 --> 17:22.360
and you are not one with your personality which is so deep,

17:22.560 --> 17:26.520
then you cannot enjoy the Self-Realization.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.960
First of all you should understand yourself.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.240
If you don't understand yourself,

17:32.440 --> 17:35.760
how can you understand other people?

17:36.160 --> 17:37.360
You cannot.

17:37.560 --> 17:42.040
So first this Sahasrara should be opened out fully.

17:42.320 --> 17:47.400
“Fully” means complete oneness with the Divine.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.360
That is not difficult.

17:52.040 --> 17:55.520
Only you have to meditate little bit

17:55.760 --> 17:57.800
and then it will work out.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.440
It has worked out in many people

17:59.640 --> 18:03.680
I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga

18:03.960 --> 18:07.880
who have achieved such a lot of collectivity

18:08.080 --> 18:13.160
and also the awareness of a realized soul.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.720
So what is the awareness of a realized soul?

18:18.120 --> 18:20.120
That is what we have to understand today

18:20.320 --> 18:23.560
it’s a very important day, as I said.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.760
The awareness is such that you should now know

18:29.080 --> 18:34.520
what is happening in this world, and how you can help it.

18:34.880 --> 18:39.480
How can you help people to get to this awareness?

18:39.680 --> 18:45.800
Unless you have this full, full knowledge about yourself,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.520
complete strength about yourself

18:48.760 --> 18:52.320
and the confidence, you cannot do it.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.480
Sahasrara Day is to be celebrated

18:55.680 --> 19:01.400
just to strengthen your bond with the Divine,

19:01.600 --> 19:07.680
so that your consciousness becomes absolutely enlightened,

19:07.880 --> 19:12.200
and you see the right point in everything.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.120
It has been in so many countries I have seen,

19:16.320 --> 19:21.360
people have taken to it very, very fast.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.560
Surprising, in Africa which is

19:24.760 --> 19:28.440
not supposed to be very developed country

19:28.640 --> 19:32.560
it's good because thousands have got realization.

19:32.760 --> 19:33.840
Those who are developed

19:33.960 --> 19:36.999
have gone beyond the point of ascent, I think.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.240
That must be the point, they have to come back

19:40.440 --> 19:45.120
from that developed state to this state from where they can rise.

19:45.320 --> 19:49.680
And so the people who have, though got realization

19:49.800 --> 19:52.720
are not ascending so fast as the people

19:52.999 --> 19:58.840
who are not yet so much advanced and modernized.

20:00.920 --> 20:04.640
Still it has worked, it has worked in so many people,

20:04.840 --> 20:08.999
and so many have got this ascent very well.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.760
But I would say that when you are meditating,

20:13.960 --> 20:20.760
also outside you should develop a state of witness.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.880
You should try to find out what is the matter,

20:25.080 --> 20:27.920
what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

20:28.120 --> 20:31.040
and how you can help it.

20:31.640 --> 20:32.960
Only with your vibrations

20:33.080 --> 20:36.240
you can correct so many things in your country,

20:36.440 --> 20:38.680
in your family, everywhere.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.640
And as you see now how Sahaja Yoga is growing,

20:41.840 --> 20:43.680
that there’s such a need

20:43.880 --> 20:48.760
and such a desire to get Self-Realization.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.600
But only thing, your approach should be full of love

20:52.800 --> 20:54.520
and full of understanding.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.600
They are coming from the darkness of ignorance

20:57.800 --> 21:04.520
and they have to go into the illumined nature of the Divine

21:04.720 --> 21:07.360
which is, can be very bright for them.

21:07.560 --> 21:14.000
So slowly, slowly if you develop this passionate kindness,

21:14.320 --> 21:15.720
love for them,

21:15.960 --> 21:20.600
I’m sure you can do much more to raise them.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.760
No use getting angry with them, because they are so ignorant,

21:24.960 --> 21:27.560
they don’t know what they are doing, you see.

21:27.760 --> 21:31.800
As Christ has said that “They don’t know what they are doing.”

21:31.999 --> 21:34.920
So what you have to do is to make them understand

21:35.120 --> 21:37.360
whatever they are doing,

21:37.560 --> 21:40.400
whatever they are understanding is still poor,

21:40.640 --> 21:45.040
it’s not so much yet expanded as it could have been

21:45.240 --> 21:47.480
if they were realized souls.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.280
Even after realization I find people have a problem.

21:52.480 --> 21:56.800
They still have the problem of the past life which is finished,

21:56.999 --> 22:00.320
it’s dead, but they still carry on with that

22:00.520 --> 22:04.640
and the consciousness, so much of illumination also

22:04.800 --> 22:06.999
doesn’t show what’s wrong with them.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.760
For example, take the case of ego.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.200
Ego is so developed.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.240
In the Western countries where they are so developed,

22:16.440 --> 22:18.280
ego has also developed,

22:18.480 --> 22:22.280
and they have to find out what’s wrong with them.

22:22.520 --> 22:28.120
This ego comes from certain consciousness

22:28.320 --> 22:30.999
that you have been something great,

22:31.200 --> 22:33.360
you are this, you are that,

22:33.560 --> 22:37.680
your parents have been great maybe, your property is great

22:37.880 --> 22:42.400
or maybe you are occupying very big position, or anything.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.999
It can come from anything,

22:44.200 --> 22:49.280
and this consciousness is against your awareness

22:49.480 --> 22:51.600
because it’s not true.

22:51.800 --> 22:57.000
You are not anything being molded by these outside things,

22:57.200 --> 23:04.880
but you are molded by your own awareness within yourself.

23:05.560 --> 23:07.999
This awareness has to grow.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.920
From where? – is to understand

23:11.080 --> 23:14.600
how do we get this ego, from what point.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.240
Yesterday I felt there were lots of people

23:17.440 --> 23:20.680
who were having a lot of right side on them.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.920
This right side is of no help.

23:23.120 --> 23:26.600
It will create problems for you, sickness for you,

23:26.800 --> 23:30.640
and also no use having right-sided Sahaja yogis.

23:30.840 --> 23:35.840
So the main thing is to understand the power of love.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.480
Power of love is the highest and the greatest,

23:39.680 --> 23:44.840
and if you can manage somehow or other to give up your anger,

23:45.040 --> 23:49.920
give up your greed and also your ego

23:50.120 --> 23:53.920
if you can do that, you can be in Sahasrara.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.999
Now just see the sport of ego.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.360
It stops your ascent further.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.999
At ego only people get lost,

24:03.200 --> 24:07.080
because at ego only they move to the left or to the right

24:07.280 --> 24:11.480
and they can go to the too much of right side,

24:11.880 --> 24:14.400
or can go up to the left side.

24:14.560 --> 24:19.520
They can go to any extreme of these two.

24:19.800 --> 24:23.400
So first of all we have to correct our ego.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.240
For this ego, what should we do?

24:26.440 --> 24:31.280
For this ego we should watch ourselves and laugh at ourselves.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.360
What ego do we have, of what?

24:34.560 --> 24:40.280
We are human beings, now have become divine.

24:40.480 --> 24:46.440
And with divine within us, with this light within us

24:46.640 --> 24:51.160
we have to understand that we are a part and parcel of the Divine,

24:51.360 --> 24:54.880
just a drop in the ocean of love.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.880
If you can reduce your ego,

24:58.080 --> 25:03.960
if you can bring it to the actual sense of your being,

25:04.160 --> 25:06.560
then it will work out better.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.920
I find it in the West, this ego is very strong – very, very strong.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.040
And whatever they do wrong they think is correct,

25:17.240 --> 25:20.200
because ego can support you in every way.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.480
While on the contrary those people who are developing,

25:23.640 --> 25:25.760
the countries who are not yet developed,

25:25.960 --> 25:30.760
there the people, problem is not of ego but of superego.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.680
That can be corrected.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.400
But ego is your own enemy created by you.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.440
So you have to fight it,

25:38.600 --> 25:42.080
and see for yourself from where it is coming.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.800
It might be country-wise, it might be family-wise,

25:46.000 --> 25:47.760
it can be from anywhere.

25:47.960 --> 25:51.080
So first of all we must watch out for the ego,

25:51.280 --> 25:55.880
if it is Sahasrara we have to enter into.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.440
When I was looking out for a collective happening

25:59.600 --> 26:01.040
of Sahasrara opening,

26:01.240 --> 26:06.040
I found it was the ego of people which was keeping Me down.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.640
I had to fight the ego of people.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.920
Because I am a woman of a very simple habits,

26:13.120 --> 26:16.560
no pride, nothing, so people used to suppress Me,

26:16.760 --> 26:19.040
say all kinds of things to Me.

26:19.240 --> 26:23.080
But I understood them because they had ego problem.

26:23.280 --> 26:27.360
And once this ego evolves and tries to dominate,

26:27.560 --> 26:29.880
we can have Hitlers in this country,

26:30.080 --> 26:34.000
we can have all these horrible people all over the world.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.920
So the first thing you should understand:

26:36.120 --> 26:40.840
those who have ego, we should not ever subdue to them.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.560
Of course you shouldn’t start fighting,

26:43.760 --> 26:46.960
but you have faith in yourself that you are people

26:47.160 --> 26:50.200
who have got Self-Realization.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.800
You are much more powerful than they are.

26:53.960 --> 26:58.520
My powers only work out when you are realized souls,

26:58.720 --> 27:01.760
you’ll be surprised. They work out many things

27:01.920 --> 27:04.960
which may not work out with people with ego.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.800
Like the other day I heard from Africa

27:07.999 --> 27:12.160
that people become invisible suddenly.

27:12.400 --> 27:17.160
There was coup d’état and the President is Sahaja yogi,

27:17.360 --> 27:20.200
he became invisible, nobody could find him.

27:20.640 --> 27:24.880
Because they are very much surrendered,

27:25.520 --> 27:32.320
they are so much surrendered that they get advantage of My powers.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.600
You all should use My powers also, of protection.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.800
This protection power is very, very strong,

27:39.999 --> 27:45.920
specially for people who are very much in Sahaja Yoga,

27:46.120 --> 27:47.360
who are very much there.

27:47.560 --> 27:52.480
So you must have first of all complete faith in yourself

27:52.680 --> 27:56.160
that you are Sahaja yogis – but not the ego.

27:56.360 --> 27:59.440
“Sahaja yogis” means you cannot have ego.

27:59.800 --> 28:04.160
This ego business has come from various sources, you know that,

28:04.360 --> 28:06.280
but it has to be cleansed out.

28:06.480 --> 28:10.920
Like when the river flows all kinds of dirt, filth flows into it,

28:11.120 --> 28:15.480
but when it meets the sea it becomes the sea.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.320
In the same way you have to become that.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.400
To become the sea, what you have to do

28:20.600 --> 28:23.080
is to forget all these tributaries

28:23.280 --> 28:24.840
which were coming into you,

28:25.040 --> 28:27.720
and all these wrong ideas which came to you.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.160
It can be from any source.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.600
I do not know how to name them because

28:32.800 --> 28:35.280
there’s a big list of these sources.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.400
People are mad sometimes with this ego.

28:38.600 --> 28:43.880
So main thing is how to watch and witness your ego-

28:44.080 --> 28:47.680
how it works, how it spoils your temperament,

28:47.880 --> 28:49.960
how it spoils your relationships,

28:50.200 --> 28:53.040
how it makes you stupid.

28:53.360 --> 28:57.120
Ego is, first thing it does is to make you very stupid,

28:57.320 --> 28:59.440
and you start behaving in such a manner

28:59.640 --> 29:00.999
that people start thinking that

29:01.200 --> 29:05.520
Oh, you are the great, stupidest person ever living.”

29:05.760 --> 29:07.560
But it is of no help

29:07.800 --> 29:10.920
because if they believe that you are a stupid person,

29:11.120 --> 29:12.400
what will happen?

29:12.560 --> 29:15.120
On the contrary if you have the wisdom,

29:15.320 --> 29:16.480
if you have that peace,

29:16.640 --> 29:19.720
if you have that special temperament

29:19.920 --> 29:23.520
of enjoying everything in life

29:23.720 --> 29:26.680
and also the collective temperament,

29:27.160 --> 29:29.600
it will work out. They will be impressed,

29:29.800 --> 29:35.520
because in that light they can see their own stupidity,

29:35.720 --> 29:38.400
own falsehood, everything,

29:38.600 --> 29:43.080
and they will realize that what they think is not true.

29:43.320 --> 29:46.560
“This gentleman is much deeper than me.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.560
What he has got, I haven’t got it.”

29:49.880 --> 29:52.320
This is the main thing for all of us.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.880
In Sahaja Yoga we have people who are leaders.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.840
That doesn’t mean they become really leaders,

30:00.080 --> 30:03.400
but that means that they have a greater depth.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.560
If they don’t have, they get out.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.720
If they have the depth then they are leaders,

30:08.920 --> 30:10.560
in the sense others see them

30:10.760 --> 30:16.360
and really enjoy, really enjoy their being there.

30:16.600 --> 30:21.040
So, in everything you can see for yourself,

30:21.240 --> 30:23.680
specially, I would say, for the leaders

30:23.920 --> 30:28.600
because people see them and they are the ideals for them.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.680
For Me, they say that “Mother is after all Mother,

30:31.880 --> 30:34.520
what can we achieve from Her?”

30:34.720 --> 30:37.120
But from the leaders they learn a lesson,

30:37.320 --> 30:43.320
and they understand that this is wrong and this is not proper.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.800
First of all you should be model, models of Sahaja Yoga.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.680
And that is what I have been always telling you

30:50.960 --> 30:53.480
that get rid of your ego.

30:53.680 --> 30:57.520
It’s the worst thing, because first of all it brings anger.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.840
You think you are something great

31:00.040 --> 31:01.880
and you can do this, you can do that

31:02.080 --> 31:04.440
because you are a Sahaja yogi- it´s not true.

31:04.720 --> 31:08.680
On the contrary you become extremely humble, extremely humble,

31:08.880 --> 31:10.600
and you do right things.

31:10.800 --> 31:15.600
You do not become any more, any more, arrogant

31:16.280 --> 31:19.520
and also full of anger.

31:19.720 --> 31:23.160
Anger departs from you completely, completely.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.840
It gives you a balance, it gives you wisdom

31:26.040 --> 31:30.920
by which you see what is your job, why are you on this earth,

31:31.080 --> 31:33.400
why this energy has come to you,

31:33.640 --> 31:36.120
why you are a divine personality.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.720
It’s a very, very great responsibility.

31:39.999 --> 31:43.080
You don’t have to look after yourself, no.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.960
The Divine will look after you, absolutely.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.440
It will protect you, it will look after you,

31:50.640 --> 31:53.200
it will do whatever is needed for you.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.160
But in case, in case you have this ego,

31:58.360 --> 32:02.360
you shut out yourself from the reality, from the truth,

32:02.560 --> 32:08.440
and you become very hot-tempered and arrogant personality.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.320
This has to go away.

32:10.520 --> 32:15.520
Sahaja yogis are saints- not saints but they are more than saints

32:15.840 --> 32:18.560
because they can express themselves better.

32:18.760 --> 32:22.240
They have powers in them which they can utilize,

32:22.440 --> 32:27.240
which they can show to other people that you are so powerful,

32:27.440 --> 32:33.640
that you can manage things much better than what you think.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.800
For example, say there’s a problem

32:37.000 --> 32:39.600
and the whole world is upset about it.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.200
Only thing if you know how to witness it, it will disappear,

32:44.480 --> 32:46.680
it will disappear in the whole world.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.520
It cannot remain there.

32:48.720 --> 32:52.880
So nowadays the world is full of turmoil as you see,

32:53.080 --> 32:55.800
full of nonsensical people coming up,

32:56.080 --> 33:02.760
full of quarrelsome people, dominating people are overpowering.

33:02.960 --> 33:07.120
At this time if you just see this in the witness state,

33:07.320 --> 33:08.720
this will disappear.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.400
Because very powerful you are, very powerful,

33:11.600 --> 33:13.360
but you must know first of all

33:13.560 --> 33:17.320
that you must have the equipment to use the power.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.320
If you have that equipment within you, you can do it.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.800
But with your ego you cannot.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.760
Ego is the greatest hurdle for your ascent.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.120
You see that ego is at a place

33:31.320 --> 33:37.000
where you have to just cross to go to Sahasrara.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.360
And to break Sahasrara is very easy otherwise,

33:40.600 --> 33:45.760
but if there is ego you are already lost in that ego.

33:45.960 --> 33:51.880
So against all this one has to understand that, watch yourself.

33:52.080 --> 33:56.680
Is he egoistical? What does it think about itself?

33:56.880 --> 34:00.880
Ego is very limited, it makes you limited,

34:01.080 --> 34:04.160
and you don’t see the purpose of your life.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.680
Why have you become a realized soul? You don’t understand.

34:07.880 --> 34:11.640
You just are involved in your own affairs,

34:11.840 --> 34:14.520
in your family, in your children,

34:14.640 --> 34:17.360
in your something like that, very low.

34:17.560 --> 34:24.320
But if you have - if you have - an egoless temperament

34:24.520 --> 34:28.400
then you are very effective, the whole power works.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.640
What I’ve seen, the power of Sahasrara is so great.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.400
In some people it has worked wonders,

34:35.680 --> 34:38.280
they have worked it well, greatly.

34:38.560 --> 34:43.320
But because of ego, so many people are still not of that level

34:43.520 --> 34:46.880
that we can say they are Sahaja yogis.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.080
Now as it is I am here to tell you about it.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.400
And in those days when these saints came in,

34:53.600 --> 34:56.360
nobody was there to guide them, to tell them anything.

34:56.560 --> 35:01.560
On the contrary they were so much destroyed by the surroundings,

35:01.760 --> 35:05.640
and people never understood why they don’t have any ego,

35:05.840 --> 35:07.680
why they are so humble,

35:07.880 --> 35:10.920
so they misused. But now you have powers.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.280
You must know how to use your powers.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.320
But that should not give you by any chance

35:15.560 --> 35:17.880
any ego that you have powers.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.240
On the contrary, you should be humble.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.280
You have power to be humble,

35:22.480 --> 35:25.160
and if you can be humble and understand

35:25.360 --> 35:28.240
that these people are not yet realized souls,

35:28.440 --> 35:30.000
they’re at a lower level.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.800
Still their ego is catching them and they’re at a lower level,

35:34.000 --> 35:35.360
they have to come up.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.600
When you understand that, then you will have not only pity

35:38.800 --> 35:40.999
but also understanding about them,

35:41.200 --> 35:44.960
and a kind of a help will come to you from the Divine

35:45.160 --> 35:47.160
that will solve your problems.

35:47.360 --> 35:52.040
I find most of you have problems of very low level sometimes.

35:52.240 --> 35:52.840
And then I am surprised,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.999
why are you bothered about these problems?

35:56.160 --> 35:57.680
You see, you are so powerful.

35:57.880 --> 36:01.600
So in Sahasrara you must know what powers are there.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.400
There are one thousand powers,

36:04.840 --> 36:09.440
one thousand powers within you which are being enlightened.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.160
If you can understand that,

36:11.360 --> 36:14.960
then you will understand that what’s the use of having ego,

36:15.160 --> 36:18.440
because you have such a lot of powers within you

36:18.640 --> 36:20.480
which you have not utilized.

36:20.680 --> 36:24.560
We should use, but with the, because of ego you cannot.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.440
With love you can.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.360
With love you can manage, and you can do a lot.

36:29.560 --> 36:34.040
So I would request all of you today to take a vow

36:34.240 --> 36:38.680
that “We’ll have no more chances for our egos.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.080
We’ll give it up.

36:40.280 --> 36:43.080
We’ll give up our ego.” Because there’s no sense

36:43.280 --> 36:45.400
that’s an obstruction between us.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.560
When the Sahasrara wants to work

36:47.680 --> 36:50.600
it cannot because of ego obstruction,

36:50.800 --> 36:53.560
so better not have ego of anything.

36:53.760 --> 36:55.240
You may be a good singer,

36:55.440 --> 36:58.360
you may be anything in life, may be some big man

36:58.560 --> 37:01.640
or anything what is so-called, has no meaning.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.040
What we need today are people who are egoless

37:05.240 --> 37:09.960
and who have powers completely flowing in them.

37:10.160 --> 37:14.040
With the opening of Sahasrara all these powers should flow.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.200
If the Sahasrara is fully opened,

37:16.440 --> 37:19.400
all these powers of love should flow.

37:19.600 --> 37:20.320
You’ll be amazed,

37:20.480 --> 37:23.160
I mean, wherever I go people just fall in love with Me.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.320
I don’t know why, I don’t do anything to them,

37:25.520 --> 37:28.040
but just they feel My love.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.800
That’s what it should be, that people should feel your love

37:31.999 --> 37:36.760
and they should know that you are a lovable person.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.920
This is the thing you are made as special people,

37:40.120 --> 37:43.960
very special for this whole world’s emancipation.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.920
That’s your job, and not otherwise just collecting money

37:48.120 --> 37:50.720
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

37:50.999 --> 37:54.040
You are for here very, very sensible job

37:54.240 --> 37:58.160
which is to raise the kundalini of people

37:58.360 --> 38:01.960
and make them aware of their greatness.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.320
Human beings are not created only to war and fight,

38:05.520 --> 38:09.240
not created here to play politics and do all dirty tricks.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.520
Here, they are not made here

38:12.720 --> 38:17.800
to lead a life which is very, I would say, filthy and dirty,

38:17.999 --> 38:20.480
but in this world we are here

38:20.680 --> 38:24.080
to do such a great job of God who has created us.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.240
So this is possible if you are aware

38:27.440 --> 38:31.040
that your Sahasraras are being opened out,

38:31.240 --> 38:36.200
and that in this Sahasrara resides the purity,

38:36.440 --> 38:40.400
not all these small little things about which you are worried.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.760
Some people try to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

38:43.960 --> 38:45.720
thinking that – oh, they can do better,

38:45.920 --> 38:49.440
they can have help of others - nothing of the kind.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.960
You can be helped by yourself, you don’t need any help.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.840
On the contrary you have to help others.

38:56.040 --> 39:00.880
There is no need to expect any help from anyone. .

39:01.080 --> 39:04.200
Look at Me, I am an ordinary housewife otherwise,

39:04.400 --> 39:07.160
but how it has worked all over the world.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.640
By what? By just the power of love.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.999
Only trouble is that I can use My power of love,

39:14.200 --> 39:17.200
but you don’t know how to use. That's the only problem.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.440
If you want to use your power of love,

39:19.640 --> 39:23.240
in meditation you can develop that power of love.

39:23.440 --> 39:28.840
With that you can capture people, with that you can understand.

39:29.040 --> 39:32.400
Their problems are that they are not Sahaja yogis,

39:32.600 --> 39:38.240
they are not the people who are having all the blessings

39:38.440 --> 39:40.240
or the connection with the Divine.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.880
Imagine, you are connected with Divine.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.520
And Divine is such a great thing

39:45.720 --> 39:47.800
which has created this whole universe,

39:47.999 --> 39:51.480
created you, and have done all the great jobs.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.560
So what are you?

39:52.760 --> 39:55.480
You are a part and parcel of that divine Power,

39:55.680 --> 40:00.240
so why not we use our divine Power fully within us

40:00.440 --> 40:03.600
with love and with understanding

40:03.800 --> 40:06.600
so that you develop this wisdom within you.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.160
This is what is to be told to yourself,

40:09.320 --> 40:11.240
that “We are realized souls.”

40:11.440 --> 40:16.800
This one is something, a personality special, very much special.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.360
In this world there were very few people who are realized souls,

40:20.560 --> 40:22.999
but now we have so many, I can see them.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.720
But still if it’s lacking in … some problems are there

40:27.920 --> 40:30.160
because of our ego.

40:30.360 --> 40:33.960
One should not have ego of anything. Everything is perishable,

40:34.160 --> 40:36.920
what is not perishable is divine love,

40:37.160 --> 40:40.640
what is not perishable is divine personality.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.280
All the time you see the saints and all that,

40:43.480 --> 40:46.480
though they are dead, people remember them.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.160
All their poetry is remembered.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.800
Though they could not do much of Sahasrara work,

40:51.999 --> 40:54.240
they couldn’t give realization to people,

40:54.440 --> 40:58.680
still because of their personality they are still respected.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.400
And people know that

41:00.560 --> 41:03.720
these people have been doing marvelous things,

41:03.920 --> 41:05.240
miraculous things.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.480
In the same way you can see your own miracles,

41:08.680 --> 41:12.120
and you can see for yourself what you are capable of,

41:12.320 --> 41:15.240
because now you are connected with the Divine.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.920
This is one fact you should know.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.760
Whenever there is danger, whenever there is problem

41:20.960 --> 41:23.320
you will say you’ll be saved.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.160
Many have been saved out of you, no doubt,

41:26.360 --> 41:30.880
but that is not sufficient. You are saved for what?

41:31.080 --> 41:34.320
What is the value of your life, why are you living?

41:34.520 --> 41:38.160
What is the matter, why God has saved you, given you all this?

41:38.360 --> 41:42.760
Because there’s so much to be done for this world.

41:42.960 --> 41:48.360
You are the, I should say soldiers of truth, soldier of goodness,

41:48.560 --> 41:53.480
and all that is to be done with great courage and understanding

41:53.680 --> 41:54.840
about yourself.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.840
So what you have to do is to have self-knowledge.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.800
You have to know about yourself.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.720
You must have self-knowledge, what you are.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.160
If that you don’t have,

42:04.320 --> 42:06.120
what’s the use of opening the Sahasrara?

42:06.320 --> 42:09.280
Self-knowledge is, doesn’t give you any pride, nothing,

42:09.480 --> 42:12.640
but gives you the duty what you have to do,

42:12.840 --> 42:14.800
what you have to work out.

42:14.999 --> 42:18.080
It’s not only just for you, that Sahaja Yoga,

42:18.280 --> 42:21.520
but you are for the whole world – please try to understand.

42:21.720 --> 42:25.360
Sometimes we think Sahaja Yoga is there for our betterment,

42:25.560 --> 42:28.320
for our good health, this, that. It’s not so.

42:28.520 --> 42:33.840
It is for the betterment of others.

42:34.040 --> 42:37.560
Your powers are there which you are not utilizing.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.920
You are still busy- I get letters saying that

42:40.120 --> 42:42.560
“this is wrong with us, this is wrong with that..”

42:42.760 --> 42:44.840
I mean, why can’t you correct yourself?

42:45.040 --> 42:47.999
If you can’t correct yourself, how can you correct others?

42:48.200 --> 42:49.440
That’s what it is.

42:49.640 --> 42:53.880
I would say, I can see

42:54.080 --> 42:58.680
that there’s an understanding going into your understanding

42:58.880 --> 43:03.480
that you are great and you’re not ordinary people.

43:03.880 --> 43:08.480
And this has to be practiced and to be used in a manner

43:08.680 --> 43:12.240
that will show that you are Sahaja yogis.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.000
You are no less than any, any Sufi or

43:15.240 --> 43:18.880
any realized soul or any saint, no less.

43:19.080 --> 43:22.600
But you have powers which they didn’t have,

43:22.800 --> 43:26.560
of which they were not conscious, while you have these powers.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.040
Try to understand what powers you have.

43:29.240 --> 43:30.760
But by understanding that,

43:30.960 --> 43:33.280
you should not have pride about it or in a way,

43:33.480 --> 43:36.840
but that’s your job, you have to do it. You are there,

43:37.040 --> 43:43.040
and you’ll enjoy it because it is not with ego, but egoless work.

43:43.240 --> 43:46.240
If you can manage that much, it will be very good.

43:46.440 --> 43:49.480
Now ego has come down very much, I must say, very much.

43:49.680 --> 43:53.960
I hear from people that ego has come down.

43:54.480 --> 43:57.360
But sometimes they are still quite funny

43:57.560 --> 43:59.480
and fighting, and this and that.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.920
But despite all that, I must say in this,

44:02.120 --> 44:06.040
whatever work has been done on these years,

44:06.240 --> 44:08.160
people have worked it out among themselves.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.320
So you have to watch yourself

44:11.520 --> 44:15.560
and see for yourself what ego you have,

44:15.800 --> 44:18.120
what, why should you be egoistical?

44:18.320 --> 44:21.200
Some of the people have ego of their country,

44:21.400 --> 44:24.000
some of the people – I mean it’s all mythical.

44:24.240 --> 44:27.960
It’s all mythical. What is there, you could have been born anywhere.

44:28.160 --> 44:31.600
So you are born in a particular country, you have that ego.

44:31.800 --> 44:35.160
And it is something, I must say, one has to be ashamed of;

44:35.360 --> 44:40.120
because your country whatever it is, is not doing very well,

44:40.320 --> 44:42.120
it’s not spiritually equipped,

44:42.320 --> 44:45.040
so why should you be so proud of your country?

44:45.240 --> 44:46.600
When you will work it out

44:46.840 --> 44:48.800
and they will become spiritually equipped,

44:48.999 --> 44:52.040
then of course you can have pride in your country,

44:52.240 --> 44:56.440
but I see not that happening. And so you have to work it out.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.560
And I am also happy to see

44:58.760 --> 45:01.960
that so much of Sahaja Yoga is now spread out everywhere.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.800
It’s spreading very fast.

45:03.999 --> 45:07.360
In countries where I never expected, it’s spreading out.

45:07.600 --> 45:11.320
So there are people everywhere in the world who want to have it.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.480
They want to have their realization,

45:13.640 --> 45:18.960
and they want to know what is beyond this human life.

45:19.160 --> 45:22.400
They don’t want to waste their life anymore as human beings;

45:22.600 --> 45:26.840
but as super-human beings I should call them, as Sahaja yogis.

45:27.040 --> 45:32.960
So our ego has to be seen, is to be watched in witness state,

45:33.160 --> 45:34.200
how it works

45:34.400 --> 45:39.600
and how it tries to dissuade us

45:39.760 --> 45:43.040
from the right path of movement.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.999
One has to be only careful on that point,

45:46.200 --> 45:50.880
because that’s the last center which has to be opened out.

45:51.160 --> 45:55.800
Once it is completely open, you are one with the Divine

45:56.240 --> 45:58.600
and your all problems will be solved,

45:58.800 --> 46:03.320
because these problems are so frivolous and has no meaning.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.200
They’ll go away in no time, as long

46:06.360 --> 46:09.800
as you work it out, your Sahasrara.

46:10.080 --> 46:13.760
It’s very nice that today is a very special day

46:13.960 --> 46:18.000
with all these three stars are coming together,

46:18.200 --> 46:21.080
and it’s special blessing.

46:23.360 --> 46:29.080
If your powers increase, all these people who are very bad,

46:29.280 --> 46:31.920
who are trying to capture the society

46:32.160 --> 46:34.640
with their political nonsense and all that,

46:34.840 --> 46:36.080
they all will disappear.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.040
They have no powers, they’ll all disappear.

46:39.240 --> 46:43.720
So, first of all your egoless nature will help,

46:43.920 --> 46:45.440
will help everyone.

46:45.600 --> 46:47.720
May God bless you all.
