00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.800
Today is a very great day I must say,

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:53.680
to celebrate Sahasrara, the puja of Sahasrara.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:02.040
It’s a very unique thing that has happened,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.240
that your Sahasraras were opened out.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.240
There were some very few people in this whole world;

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.760
there were some Sufis, there were some saints,

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:23.360
some other people also in China and all.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.680
But very few, very few got their Sahasrara opened out.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:38.080
So whatever they said or written was never understood

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.080
by the people.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.960
They actually tortured them, they crucified them

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.040
and did all kinds of horrible things,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:56.080
because they couldn’t bear somebody getting this realization.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.720
So it’s a very great day

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.560
because collectively this Sahasrara has been opened.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.280
Every one of you have got it.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.960
Also all over the world you have many people

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.280
who have got their Sahasraras open.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.000
Of course we need many more, for them to understand

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:33.280
what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrara.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.640
Some have grown very much

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.200
after getting their realization, very much.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.240
They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.760
and they have developed their depth

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.640
and their consciousness

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:56.160
is really a great awareness of oneness with the Divine.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.800
To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.960
So far they were human beings at a lower level of existence,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.480
and they had all the problems of that level,

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.999
is that jealousies, hatred-

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.080
all kinds of problems that are today of fighting,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.800
of troubling others,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.480
destroying others and not loving others.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.520
All these problems existed because

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.480
their Sahasrara was not opened.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:43.920
So our main problem is

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.880
to open the Sahasrara of the people all over the world-

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.920
which is very simple, which you can all do it,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.640
and it will work better if you do it collectively.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.120
If you are collective you can work it out very well.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.200
Like that in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.360
whose Sahasrara was completely opened,

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.880
and they felt their depth.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.600
Firstly, you must feel your depth.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.600
If you don’t feel your depth

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.360
and you are not one with your personality which is so deep,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.520
then you cannot enjoy the Self-Realization.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.960
First of all you should understand yourself.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.240
If you don't understand yourself,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.760
how can you understand other people?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.360
You cannot.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.040
So first this Sahasrara should be opened out fully.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.400
“Fully” means complete oneness with the Divine.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.360
That is not difficult.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.520
Only you have to meditate little bit

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.800
and then it will work out.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.440
It has worked out in many people

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.680
I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.880
who have achieved such a lot of collectivity

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.160
and also the awareness of a realized soul.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.720
So what is the awareness of a realized soul?

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.120
That is what we have to understand today

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.560
it’s a very important day, as I said.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.760
The awareness is such that you should now know

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.520
what is happening in this world, and how you can help it.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.480
How can you help people to get to this awareness?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:45.800
Unless you have this full, full knowledge about yourself,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.520
complete strength about yourself

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.320
and the confidence, you cannot do it.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.480
Sahasrara Day is to be celebrated

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.400
just to strengthen your bond with the Divine,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.680
so that your consciousness becomes absolutely enlightened,

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.200
and you see the right point in everything.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.120
It has been in so many countries I have seen,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.360
people have taken to it very, very fast.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.560
Surprising, in Africa which is

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.440
not supposed to be very developed country

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.560
it's good because thousands have got realization.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.840
Those who are developed

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.999
have gone beyond the point of ascent, I think.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.240
That must be the point, they have to come back

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.120
from that developed state to this state from where they can rise.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.680
And so the people who have, though got realization

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.720
are not ascending so fast as the people

00:19:52.999 --> 00:19:58.840
who are not yet so much advanced and modernized.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.640
Still it has worked, it has worked in so many people,

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.999
and so many have got this ascent very well.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.760
But I would say that when you are meditating,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:20.760
also outside you should develop a state of witness.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.880
You should try to find out what is the matter,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.920
what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.040
and how you can help it.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.960
Only with your vibrations

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.240
you can correct so many things in your country,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.680
in your family, everywhere.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.640
And as you see now how Sahaja Yoga is growing,

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.680
that there’s such a need

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.760
and such a desire to get Self-Realization.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.600
But only thing, your approach should be full of love

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.520
and full of understanding.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.600
They are coming from the darkness of ignorance

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:04.520
and they have to go into the illumined nature of the Divine

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.360
which is, can be very bright for them.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:14.000
So slowly, slowly if you develop this passionate kindness,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.720
love for them,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.600
I’m sure you can do much more to raise them.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.760
No use getting angry with them, because they are so ignorant,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.560
they don’t know what they are doing, you see.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.800
As Christ has said that “They don’t know what they are doing.”

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.920
So what you have to do is to make them understand

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.360
whatever they are doing,

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.400
whatever they are understanding is still poor,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.040
it’s not so much yet expanded as it could have been

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.480
if they were realized souls.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.280
Even after realization I find people have a problem.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.800
They still have the problem of the past life which is finished,

00:21:56.999 --> 00:22:00.320
it’s dead, but they still carry on with that

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.640
and the consciousness, so much of illumination also

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.999
doesn’t show what’s wrong with them.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.760
For example, take the case of ego.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.200
Ego is so developed.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.240
In the Western countries where they are so developed,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.280
ego has also developed,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.280
and they have to find out what’s wrong with them.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.120
This ego comes from certain consciousness

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.999
that you have been something great,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.360
you are this, you are that,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.680
your parents have been great maybe, your property is great

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.400
or maybe you are occupying very big position, or anything.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.999
It can come from anything,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.280
and this consciousness is against your awareness

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.600
because it’s not true.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.000
You are not anything being molded by these outside things,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:04.880
but you are molded by your own awareness within yourself.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.999
This awareness has to grow.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.920
From where? – is to understand

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.600
how do we get this ego, from what point.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.240
Yesterday I felt there were lots of people

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.680
who were having a lot of right side on them.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.920
This right side is of no help.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.600
It will create problems for you, sickness for you,

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.640
and also no use having right-sided Sahaja yogis.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.840
So the main thing is to understand the power of love.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.480
Power of love is the highest and the greatest,

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.840
and if you can manage somehow or other to give up your anger,

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.920
give up your greed and also your ego

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.920
if you can do that, you can be in Sahasrara.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.999
Now just see the sport of ego.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.360
It stops your ascent further.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.999
At ego only people get lost,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.080
because at ego only they move to the left or to the right

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.480
and they can go to the too much of right side,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.400
or can go up to the left side.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.520
They can go to any extreme of these two.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.400
So first of all we have to correct our ego.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.240
For this ego, what should we do?

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.280
For this ego we should watch ourselves and laugh at ourselves.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.360
What ego do we have, of what?

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.280
We are human beings, now have become divine.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:46.440
And with divine within us, with this light within us

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.160
we have to understand that we are a part and parcel of the Divine,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.880
just a drop in the ocean of love.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.880
If you can reduce your ego,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:03.960
if you can bring it to the actual sense of your being,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.560
then it will work out better.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.920
I find it in the West, this ego is very strong – very, very strong.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.040
And whatever they do wrong they think is correct,

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.200
because ego can support you in every way.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.480
While on the contrary those people who are developing,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.760
the countries who are not yet developed,

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.760
there the people, problem is not of ego but of superego.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.680
That can be corrected.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.400
But ego is your own enemy created by you.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.440
So you have to fight it,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.080
and see for yourself from where it is coming.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.800
It might be country-wise, it might be family-wise,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.760
it can be from anywhere.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.080
So first of all we must watch out for the ego,

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.880
if it is Sahasrara we have to enter into.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.440
When I was looking out for a collective happening

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.040
of Sahasrara opening,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.040
I found it was the ego of people which was keeping Me down.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.640
I had to fight the ego of people.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.920
Because I am a woman of a very simple habits,

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.560
no pride, nothing, so people used to suppress Me,

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.040
say all kinds of things to Me.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.080
But I understood them because they had ego problem.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.360
And once this ego evolves and tries to dominate,

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.880
we can have Hitlers in this country,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.000
we can have all these horrible people all over the world.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.920
So the first thing you should understand:

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.840
those who have ego, we should not ever subdue to them.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.560
Of course you shouldn’t start fighting,

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.960
but you have faith in yourself that you are people

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.200
who have got Self-Realization.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.800
You are much more powerful than they are.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.520
My powers only work out when you are realized souls,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.760
you’ll be surprised. They work out many things

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.960
which may not work out with people with ego.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.800
Like the other day I heard from Africa

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:12.160
that people become invisible suddenly.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.160
There was coup d’état and the President is Sahaja yogi,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.200
he became invisible, nobody could find him.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.880
Because they are very much surrendered,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:32.320
they are so much surrendered that they get advantage of My powers.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.600
You all should use My powers also, of protection.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.800
This protection power is very, very strong,

00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:45.920
specially for people who are very much in Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.360
who are very much there.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.480
So you must have first of all complete faith in yourself

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.160
that you are Sahaja yogis – but not the ego.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.440
“Sahaja yogis” means you cannot have ego.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.160
This ego business has come from various sources, you know that,

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.280
but it has to be cleansed out.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.920
Like when the river flows all kinds of dirt, filth flows into it,

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.480
but when it meets the sea it becomes the sea.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.320
In the same way you have to become that.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.400
To become the sea, what you have to do

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.080
is to forget all these tributaries

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.840
which were coming into you,

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.720
and all these wrong ideas which came to you.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.160
It can be from any source.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.600
I do not know how to name them because

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.280
there’s a big list of these sources.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.400
People are mad sometimes with this ego.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.880
So main thing is how to watch and witness your ego-

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.680
how it works, how it spoils your temperament,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.960
how it spoils your relationships,

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.040
how it makes you stupid.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.120
Ego is, first thing it does is to make you very stupid,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.440
and you start behaving in such a manner

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.999
that people start thinking that

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.520
Oh, you are the great, stupidest person ever living.”

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.560
But it is of no help

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.920
because if they believe that you are a stupid person,

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.400
what will happen?

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.120
On the contrary if you have the wisdom,

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.480
if you have that peace,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.720
if you have that special temperament

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.520
of enjoying everything in life

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.680
and also the collective temperament,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.600
it will work out. They will be impressed,

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:35.520
because in that light they can see their own stupidity,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.400
own falsehood, everything,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.080
and they will realize that what they think is not true.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.560
“This gentleman is much deeper than me.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.560
What he has got, I haven’t got it.”

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.320
This is the main thing for all of us.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.880
In Sahaja Yoga we have people who are leaders.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.840
That doesn’t mean they become really leaders,

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.400
but that means that they have a greater depth.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.560
If they don’t have, they get out.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.720
If they have the depth then they are leaders,

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.560
in the sense others see them

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:16.360
and really enjoy, really enjoy their being there.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.040
So, in everything you can see for yourself,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.680
specially, I would say, for the leaders

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.600
because people see them and they are the ideals for them.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.680
For Me, they say that “Mother is after all Mother,

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.520
what can we achieve from Her?”

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.120
But from the leaders they learn a lesson,

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:43.320
and they understand that this is wrong and this is not proper.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.800
First of all you should be model, models of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.680
And that is what I have been always telling you

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.480
that get rid of your ego.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.520
It’s the worst thing, because first of all it brings anger.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.840
You think you are something great

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.880
and you can do this, you can do that

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.440
because you are a Sahaja yogi- it´s not true.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.680
On the contrary you become extremely humble, extremely humble,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.600
and you do right things.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.600
You do not become any more, any more, arrogant

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.520
and also full of anger.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.160
Anger departs from you completely, completely.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.840
It gives you a balance, it gives you wisdom

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.920
by which you see what is your job, why are you on this earth,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.400
why this energy has come to you,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.120
why you are a divine personality.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.720
It’s a very, very great responsibility.

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:43.080
You don’t have to look after yourself, no.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.960
The Divine will look after you, absolutely.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.440
It will protect you, it will look after you,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.200
it will do whatever is needed for you.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:58.160
But in case, in case you have this ego,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.360
you shut out yourself from the reality, from the truth,

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:08.440
and you become very hot-tempered and arrogant personality.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.320
This has to go away.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.520
Sahaja yogis are saints- not saints but they are more than saints

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.560
because they can express themselves better.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.240
They have powers in them which they can utilize,

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.240
which they can show to other people that you are so powerful,

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:33.640
that you can manage things much better than what you think.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.800
For example, say there’s a problem

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.600
and the whole world is upset about it.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:44.200
Only thing if you know how to witness it, it will disappear,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.680
it will disappear in the whole world.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.520
It cannot remain there.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.880
So nowadays the world is full of turmoil as you see,

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.800
full of nonsensical people coming up,

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:02.760
full of quarrelsome people, dominating people are overpowering.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.120
At this time if you just see this in the witness state,

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.720
this will disappear.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.400
Because very powerful you are, very powerful,

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.360
but you must know first of all

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.320
that you must have the equipment to use the power.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.320
If you have that equipment within you, you can do it.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.800
But with your ego you cannot.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.760
Ego is the greatest hurdle for your ascent.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.120
You see that ego is at a place

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.000
where you have to just cross to go to Sahasrara.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.360
And to break Sahasrara is very easy otherwise,

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.760
but if there is ego you are already lost in that ego.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.880
So against all this one has to understand that, watch yourself.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.680
Is he egoistical? What does it think about itself?

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.880
Ego is very limited, it makes you limited,

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.160
and you don’t see the purpose of your life.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.680
Why have you become a realized soul? You don’t understand.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.640
You just are involved in your own affairs,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.520
in your family, in your children,

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.360
in your something like that, very low.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:24.320
But if you have - if you have - an egoless temperament

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.400
then you are very effective, the whole power works.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.640
What I’ve seen, the power of Sahasrara is so great.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.400
In some people it has worked wonders,

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.280
they have worked it well, greatly.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.320
But because of ego, so many people are still not of that level

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.880
that we can say they are Sahaja yogis.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.080
Now as it is I am here to tell you about it.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.400
And in those days when these saints came in,

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.360
nobody was there to guide them, to tell them anything.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.560
On the contrary they were so much destroyed by the surroundings,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.640
and people never understood why they don’t have any ego,

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.680
why they are so humble,

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.920
so they misused. But now you have powers.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.280
You must know how to use your powers.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.320
But that should not give you by any chance

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.880
any ego that you have powers.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.240
On the contrary, you should be humble.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.280
You have power to be humble,

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.160
and if you can be humble and understand

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.240
that these people are not yet realized souls,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.000
they’re at a lower level.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.800
Still their ego is catching them and they’re at a lower level,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.360
they have to come up.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.600
When you understand that, then you will have not only pity

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.999
but also understanding about them,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.960
and a kind of a help will come to you from the Divine

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.160
that will solve your problems.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.040
I find most of you have problems of very low level sometimes.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.840
And then I am surprised,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.999
why are you bothered about these problems?

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.680
You see, you are so powerful.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.600
So in Sahasrara you must know what powers are there.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.400
There are one thousand powers,

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:09.440
one thousand powers within you which are being enlightened.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.160
If you can understand that,

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.960
then you will understand that what’s the use of having ego,

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.440
because you have such a lot of powers within you

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.480
which you have not utilized.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.560
We should use, but with the, because of ego you cannot.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.440
With love you can.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.360
With love you can manage, and you can do a lot.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:34.040
So I would request all of you today to take a vow

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.680
that “We’ll have no more chances for our egos.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.080
We’ll give it up.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.080
We’ll give up our ego.” Because there’s no sense

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.400
that’s an obstruction between us.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.560
When the Sahasrara wants to work

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.600
it cannot because of ego obstruction,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.560
so better not have ego of anything.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.240
You may be a good singer,

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.360
you may be anything in life, may be some big man

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.640
or anything what is so-called, has no meaning.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.040
What we need today are people who are egoless

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.960
and who have powers completely flowing in them.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.040
With the opening of Sahasrara all these powers should flow.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.200
If the Sahasrara is fully opened,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.400
all these powers of love should flow.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.320
You’ll be amazed,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.160
I mean, wherever I go people just fall in love with Me.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.320
I don’t know why, I don’t do anything to them,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.040
but just they feel My love.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.800
That’s what it should be, that people should feel your love

00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:36.760
and they should know that you are a lovable person.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.920
This is the thing you are made as special people,

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.960
very special for this whole world’s emancipation.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.920
That’s your job, and not otherwise just collecting money

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.720
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:37:50.999 --> 00:37:54.040
You are for here very, very sensible job

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.160
which is to raise the kundalini of people

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.960
and make them aware of their greatness.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.320
Human beings are not created only to war and fight,

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.240
not created here to play politics and do all dirty tricks.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.520
Here, they are not made here

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.800
to lead a life which is very, I would say, filthy and dirty,

00:38:17.999 --> 00:38:20.480
but in this world we are here

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.080
to do such a great job of God who has created us.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.240
So this is possible if you are aware

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.040
that your Sahasraras are being opened out,

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.200
and that in this Sahasrara resides the purity,

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.400
not all these small little things about which you are worried.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.760
Some people try to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.720
thinking that – oh, they can do better,

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.440
they can have help of others - nothing of the kind.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.960
You can be helped by yourself, you don’t need any help.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.840
On the contrary you have to help others.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.880
There is no need to expect any help from anyone. .

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.200
Look at Me, I am an ordinary housewife otherwise,

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.160
but how it has worked all over the world.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.640
By what? By just the power of love.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.999
Only trouble is that I can use My power of love,

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.200
but you don’t know how to use. That's the only problem.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.440
If you want to use your power of love,

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.240
in meditation you can develop that power of love.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.840
With that you can capture people, with that you can understand.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.400
Their problems are that they are not Sahaja yogis,

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:38.240
they are not the people who are having all the blessings

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.240
or the connection with the Divine.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.880
Imagine, you are connected with Divine.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.520
And Divine is such a great thing

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.800
which has created this whole universe,

00:39:47.999 --> 00:39:51.480
created you, and have done all the great jobs.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.560
So what are you?

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.480
You are a part and parcel of that divine Power,

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.240
so why not we use our divine Power fully within us

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.600
with love and with understanding

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.600
so that you develop this wisdom within you.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.160
This is what is to be told to yourself,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.240
that “We are realized souls.”

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.800
This one is something, a personality special, very much special.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.360
In this world there were very few people who are realized souls,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.999
but now we have so many, I can see them.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.720
But still if it’s lacking in … some problems are there

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.160
because of our ego.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.960
One should not have ego of anything. Everything is perishable,

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.920
what is not perishable is divine love,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.640
what is not perishable is divine personality.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.280
All the time you see the saints and all that,

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.480
though they are dead, people remember them.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.160
All their poetry is remembered.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.800
Though they could not do much of Sahasrara work,

00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:54.240
they couldn’t give realization to people,

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.680
still because of their personality they are still respected.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.400
And people know that

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.720
these people have been doing marvelous things,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.240
miraculous things.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.480
In the same way you can see your own miracles,

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.120
and you can see for yourself what you are capable of,

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.240
because now you are connected with the Divine.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.920
This is one fact you should know.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.760
Whenever there is danger, whenever there is problem

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.320
you will say you’ll be saved.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.160
Many have been saved out of you, no doubt,

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.880
but that is not sufficient. You are saved for what?

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.320
What is the value of your life, why are you living?

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.160
What is the matter, why God has saved you, given you all this?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.760
Because there’s so much to be done for this world.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.360
You are the, I should say soldiers of truth, soldier of goodness,

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.480
and all that is to be done with great courage and understanding

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.840
about yourself.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.840
So what you have to do is to have self-knowledge.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.800
You have to know about yourself.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.720
You must have self-knowledge, what you are.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.160
If that you don’t have,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.120
what’s the use of opening the Sahasrara?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.280
Self-knowledge is, doesn’t give you any pride, nothing,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.640
but gives you the duty what you have to do,

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.800
what you have to work out.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:18.080
It’s not only just for you, that Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.520
but you are for the whole world – please try to understand.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.360
Sometimes we think Sahaja Yoga is there for our betterment,

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.320
for our good health, this, that. It’s not so.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.840
It is for the betterment of others.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.560
Your powers are there which you are not utilizing.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.920
You are still busy- I get letters saying that

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.560
“this is wrong with us, this is wrong with that..”

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.840
I mean, why can’t you correct yourself?

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.999
If you can’t correct yourself, how can you correct others?

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.440
That’s what it is.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.880
I would say, I can see

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.680
that there’s an understanding going into your understanding

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.480
that you are great and you’re not ordinary people.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.480
And this has to be practiced and to be used in a manner

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.240
that will show that you are Sahaja yogis.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.000
You are no less than any, any Sufi or

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.880
any realized soul or any saint, no less.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.600
But you have powers which they didn’t have,

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.560
of which they were not conscious, while you have these powers.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.040
Try to understand what powers you have.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.760
But by understanding that,

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.280
you should not have pride about it or in a way,

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.840
but that’s your job, you have to do it. You are there,

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.040
and you’ll enjoy it because it is not with ego, but egoless work.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.240
If you can manage that much, it will be very good.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.480
Now ego has come down very much, I must say, very much.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.960
I hear from people that ego has come down.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.360
But sometimes they are still quite funny

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.480
and fighting, and this and that.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.920
But despite all that, I must say in this,

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.040
whatever work has been done on these years,

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.160
people have worked it out among themselves.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.320
So you have to watch yourself

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.560
and see for yourself what ego you have,

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.120
what, why should you be egoistical?

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.200
Some of the people have ego of their country,

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.000
some of the people – I mean it’s all mythical.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.960
It’s all mythical. What is there, you could have been born anywhere.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.600
So you are born in a particular country, you have that ego.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.160
And it is something, I must say, one has to be ashamed of;

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.120
because your country whatever it is, is not doing very well,

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.120
it’s not spiritually equipped,

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.040
so why should you be so proud of your country?

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.600
When you will work it out

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.800
and they will become spiritually equipped,

00:44:48.999 --> 00:44:52.040
then of course you can have pride in your country,

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.440
but I see not that happening. And so you have to work it out.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.560
And I am also happy to see

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.960
that so much of Sahaja Yoga is now spread out everywhere.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.800
It’s spreading very fast.

00:45:03.999 --> 00:45:07.360
In countries where I never expected, it’s spreading out.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.320
So there are people everywhere in the world who want to have it.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.480
They want to have their realization,

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.960
and they want to know what is beyond this human life.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.400
They don’t want to waste their life anymore as human beings;

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.840
but as super-human beings I should call them, as Sahaja yogis.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:32.960
So our ego has to be seen, is to be watched in witness state,

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.200
how it works

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.600
and how it tries to dissuade us

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.040
from the right path of movement.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.999
One has to be only careful on that point,

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.880
because that’s the last center which has to be opened out.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.800
Once it is completely open, you are one with the Divine

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.600
and your all problems will be solved,

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.320
because these problems are so frivolous and has no meaning.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.200
They’ll go away in no time, as long

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.800
as you work it out, your Sahasrara.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.760
It’s very nice that today is a very special day

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.000
with all these three stars are coming together,

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.080
and it’s special blessing.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:29.080
If your powers increase, all these people who are very bad,

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.920
who are trying to capture the society

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.640
with their political nonsense and all that,

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.080
they all will disappear.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.040
They have no powers, they’ll all disappear.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.720
So, first of all your egoless nature will help,

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.440
will help everyone.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.720
May God bless you all.
