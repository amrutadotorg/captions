00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.230
Yesterday
you have seen how Durga used to protect all
the seekers, sadhakas, and how She killed

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.509
the people who have been troubling, torturing,
killing the seekers of truth. Her whole advent

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.440
was to protect them from all these evil forces.
In those days, that was the most important

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.739
work. So that's how the sadhakas came up to
these modern times, and now they are seekers

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.319
of truth or they have found the truth.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:24.319
All this different passage has taught the
sadhakas what is the use of their life. They

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.649
were frantically, first, trying to find the
truth, frantically, and they went into different

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:54.179
difficult places. They thought by going into
some lonely places they'll be able to settle

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.979
their mind in peace and they'll be able to
find the truth. Also they sacrificed many

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.429
things: their wealth, which was bothering
them; their families, they thought was standing

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.400
in the way of their search.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.400
All this
went on and there are still some people who
believe that by becoming an ascetic one can

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.930
find the truth. Buddha did the same. Mahavira
did the same. Their life was nothing but a

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.879
great tapasya. Their tapasyas are helping
us today in such a way that we now have got

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:09.749
such a blessing that our personalities, as
they are, can receive Self Realization for

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.959
which people struggled and struggled in such
a way that if you read that, how they were

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.379
suffering, you might be really amazed how
they went through all this suffering and all

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.430
this tapasya, just with the goal to get their
Self Realization.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.370
It is an ordeal even to read about them and
to know about them. And while they were seeking,

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:07.349
also, there were so many people who tried
to trouble them, who tried to torture them,

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:15.939
who tried to kill. And the people surrounding
them didn't know what they were doing. They

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.310
used to ridicule them, laugh at them, make
fun of them. With all this, what we learn

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.260
that we have got our Self Realization very
easily, without any torture, without any ordeal,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.220
without any sufferings, fasting, nothing.
It's not true. Because you are the same people

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.750
who have done all this before and that's why
you are here. It's your matter of right to

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.220
have your Self Realization. It's no way is
to say that “without anything we got it”.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.370
Because it is life after life you have been
seekers. Whatever path you followed, whatever

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.950
religion you followed, whatever faiths you
followed, it was a torture for you. And this

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.950
torture is today now fulfilled, that today
you are self-realized people.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.090
But in any way we see that human beings, if
they get something rather easily they don't

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:43.010
understand the value of how they got it. Now
to get this easily, actually you must know,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.150
is not just because you were nothing. You
were something great. You were great saints

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.520
went into Himalayas, you did all kinds of
ordeals and fasting and where so many of you

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.430
were killed and butchered in the name of God.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:19.430
So today, whatever you have got, whatever
Realization you have got, is not just something

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.870
you should think that "It's only Mother's
grace that we have got it." It's your own

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:39.010
great personality which has achieved it. Otherwise,
it would have been impossible for Me to give

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.630
you Realization. Whatever the work the deities
have done, they have brought you to this level

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:55.630
of human existence, protecting you. But now,
naturally, just this is the last step which

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.120
you have crossed and you have achieved this
Self Realization and so many of you have achieved

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.650
great heights.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.650
This power within us, the Kundalini, which
has connected you to this all-pervading

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:31.570
Power, has been struggling, has been guiding
you, has been all the time looking after you,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.740
protecting you so that you should achieve
your goal in this Kali Yuga. It was said that

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
only during Kali Yuga this will happen and
those people who are seeking God in the mountains

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:01.730
and in the valleys will find it, but they'll
be normal people, people who will have household

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:13.680
and living like normal people in the society.
They won't be some sort of sadhus or saints,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:21.990
but people who are married, who have children,
all such people who are leading a very normal

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:28.580
life will receive their Realization. It’s
already said, it’s already predicted by

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.440
Bhrugu Muni.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:37.440
So it's all been already said, I think all
been planned. But in this a credit goes, of

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.560
course, to you people, that you have recognized
what is the truth. As you know, there are

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:51.240
so many false people going about. They are
doing all kinds of tricks, they are trying

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:58.240
all kinds of methods to entice people. Despite
that, you have recognized Me. This recognition

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:07.790
is something very remarkable. And I am Myself
surprised how, like lost children finding

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:15.160
their mother, come back to her, in the same
way all of you are here.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:22.160
But in this we should not think that we have
got it easily, or we have got it without any

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:30.079
difficulties, because this can create a little
problem that we will not go further with the

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:37.990
same speed, with the same dedication as we
have been doing before. So whatever you think

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:45.209
is easy, was not easy at all. It is sahaja.
It is, one can say, spontaneous. But, now

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.620
it is for you really to understand that this
time is so important, we have to save the

00:09:54.610 --> 00:10:01.610
whole world, that you have to project yourself,
as I said last time, and to find out ways

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.279
and methods how you can do these things.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:12.699
In Russia, I must tell you, I had a very good
experience of a very highly developed soul

00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:18.910
who is a very well known scientist. He’s
one of the biggest scientists of Russia, and

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.410
he’s indulging also into spirituality.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.709
He told people that “I’m indulging into
spirituality, I would like to see Mother.”

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.939
I said, “All right, I would love to see
him.”

00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:36.939
So when he came, he looked at Me and he said,
“I know Mother, that You are the incarnation

00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:42.519
of God in these modern times.”

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:49.519
I was quite surprised for a scientist to say
that. But his eyes, so pure and so full of

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:57.899
devotion and humility. Then he says that “I
want to do something if You help me.”

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.850
I said, “What do you want to do?”

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:09.850
He said, “I cannot measure Your power, I
cannot.” He had an instrument by which he

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.350
could measure the power. “I can’t also
measure the power of Your photographs.”

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.069
He said, he told Me a number which I couldn’t
understand, was something – seven hundred

00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:24.800
raised to power, some sort of a billion into
billiardi, like that.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.170
I said, “Now what’s this number is? I
don’t know.”

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.110
So he told Me that “This is what Your photograph
is.”

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:37.529
So I said, “All right, now what do you want
Me to do?” I told him, “You can take this

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:39.980
photograph if you think it is so powerful.”

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.120
So he took the photograph with such respect
and this thing. At least four, five times

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.579
he bowed to Me. I said, “What do you want
to do about it?”

00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:55.100
He said that “I want to put it on a satellite.”
Now see the projection part – satellite.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.149
“Then what will you do?”

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:04.149
“And I’m going to put electromagnetic
force behind it so this will, the power that

00:12:05.369 --> 00:12:12.369
is in this one, will penetrate into things.
Because electromagnet can penetrate, with

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:18.639
that these vibrations will also penetrate.
So I will go onto the satellite and from there

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:25.639
I’ll project this and I’ll see the global
problems. Then wherever I’ll project this

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:38.959
the problems will be solved. I’ll try to
first of all make the land fertile with this.”

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:46.170
One photograph of Mine, can you imagine? See
his projection. I was amazed, you see. I said,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.610
“Look at this man. What he has been thinking
all the time.”

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.279
He said, “This is not difficult, it’s
not difficult.”

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:54.829
I said, “How?”

00:12:54.829 --> 00:13:01.829
So he showed Me with a spring, you know, something
was like a spring. He put it on water which

00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:08.869
I had vibrated and the spring started jumping.
And then he showed with his machine that the

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:14.160
whole thing was moving so fast, you see. “Mother,
just see the water that You have vibrated,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.449
how great it is.”

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:22.129
I said, “This is, I’ve never heard that
you can transform this power into something

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:24.829
which will work out on material thing.”

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:31.069
He said, “This power can work out in anything.
It is this power which has created everything,

00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:32.629
so it will work out in everything.”

00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:39.029
I was so surprised, and he said, “I’ve
been just waiting to meet You and this I’m

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:43.790
going to start. I’ve got a lot of work to
be done.” And he told his friend, “Now

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:50.569
let’s go, we have lot of work to be done.
I want to do all this in the lifetime of Mother.

00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:53.339
She should see what we have to do.”

00:13:53.339 --> 00:14:00.339
I was amazed from where this fellow has dropped
on this earth. Such an experience of a scientist.

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:19.179
In the West, no scientist will even look at
Me. Nobody will think that they can do something

00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:26.929
about these vibrations. But you see, he has
already developed a method by which he can

00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:33.360
measure the vibrations, you see. I don’t
know, I didn’t ask him any further questions

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:40.360
because I thought he’s too much in it and
let him do what he likes. And you see, I find

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:50.149
that in Russia, people are very highly placed
and they have many ideas, but spirituality

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:58.360
is the main thing, and morality.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.990
There was another gentleman I would say he
was hardly about thirty, thirty-two years

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:10.990
of age, very much sparkling. He came, I asked
him, “What do you want Me to do?”

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:18.220
He said, “No, You have done too much for
us, now we’ll do for You.”

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.189
“So what do you want to do?”

00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:26.579
He said, “I’m in charge here of spirituality.”
Can you imagine? We have no such government

00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:32.889
where there is a subject like spirituality
that somebody is in charge of spirituality.

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:33.769
This is Russia.

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:37.300
I said, “You are in charge of spirituality?”

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:44.300
“Yes, and I have to deal with students from
very young age to the college. And can You

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:53.050
tell me, Mother, at what age the children
are more receptive of spirituality?”

00:15:53.050 --> 00:16:00.050
I said “There is no hard and fast rule about
it. But as children, very small children because

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:07.550
they are so innocent, it works out.”

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:13.709
So he asked Me, “How do we put spirituality
into them?”

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:19.019
I said “You can raise their Kundalini, you
can tie them up and they will become really

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:23.929
people with such an attention that you will
be amazed at that.”

00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:29.279
He said “I’m gathering all the people
of all the faiths and I’m going to tell

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:35.920
them that it’s only Sahaja Yoga which is
the right path.” Can you imagine? Such a

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.709
wonderful person, hardly thirty-two years
of age, I mean one better than the other,

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:47.429
I thought. One really better than the other.
Then he asked Me the schemes, “What should

00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:54.429
we do for patriotism, what should we do for
this...” He was so much alert and he said,

00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:05.079
“Through spirituality, how can we improve
their lives? Of the students?” Now he’s

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:12.670
in charge of all the students of Russia and
he is also a member of the parliament. He

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:19.779
said, “There are other eight, nine members
who are also in the same committee and they

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:26.500
want spirituality to grow.”

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.529
I was amazed. I mean what a country is this
Russia? How could they have such people? Then

00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:38.529
the third one came. He was also member of
parliament, very dynamic. First he was right

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:47.159
hand man of Yeltsin but then he gave him up.
He said, “He’s not moral. I don’t want

00:17:47.159 --> 00:17:50.299
to have anything to do with a person who’s
not moral.”

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:52.360
“So now what are you doing?”

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:59.360
He said, “Now we are thinking of getting
elected by some, another party. Name is My

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.289
Motherland.”

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.590
I said, “Very good idea.”

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:10.090
“So in that we’ll not have fixed ideas
like it is a democracy or a, you can call

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:15.260
it, communism or this. But whatever suits
my motherland, that we’ll have.”

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:22.260
It’s a very practical, is a most practical
thing that whatever will be good for my motherland,

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.289
that we will have. Nothing else.

00:18:26.289 --> 00:18:33.210
I said, “Really this is very practical.”
And he may one day replace this Yeltsin and

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:37.340
all that. Very dynamic, very nice.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:43.880
Just now he was little bit depressed, because
he said, “They are stupid people over here,”

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.809
and this and that.

00:18:45.809 --> 00:18:52.070
But then he got very hopeful, I said, “We’ll
help you all out” and that. But such a truthful

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.570
man.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:59.570
And he said, “The basis of human life is
morality. If you have no morality, then all

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:08.610
the rest is nonsense.” He studied in England
and he said also in America for quite some

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:14.090
time, and the other fellow had studied. And
they said in America they got fed up absolutely

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.130
and, “We don’t want to go back there.”

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:24.130
So the wisdom of these people really was very
striking to Me. Now the another, third thing,

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:33.559
which I discovered is even much more deeper
than this. When I went to Ukraine, I saw some

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:44.830
very nice paintings done with a very aboriginal
sort of colors. So they said, “Mother, this

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:53.950
we had before the Christians came in.” They
showed Me a magazine in which there was a

00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:00.580
photograph of the Primordial Mother and they
called it Aditi, that’s Sanskrit. We too

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.380
also call it Aditi. Can you imagine?

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:10.380
Then they said, “This culture existed before
the Christian aggression came in.” And there

00:20:11.309 --> 00:20:18.309
was paintings of Mooladhara Chakra in different
ways and also of Agnya Chakra. And the way

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.639
they were talking about all this, even in
the magazine, I was really surprised.

00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:32.639
They said that “All this was published,
we have books on this, but because of the

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:44.500
church it was all said, “It’s all nonsense,
there’s nothing like Aditi.” But the best

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:51.500
part I saw was the picture of the Aditi and
there was a Kundalini in Her stomach. Or stomach

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.080
or lopa. And was shown going upward like that.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.490
I said, “Look at this culture these people
had.”

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:15.490
Then they said, “We had relations with India,
and they were Aryans and we were also Aryans

00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:19.190
and we used to meet them.”

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:24.840
So I thought, Macchindranath and all these
people had gone to the north of India, they

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:31.279
might have come to this Ukraine, and they
said that, I mean the whole thing was traced

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:37.799
to - Ukraine name came from Kuru and all kinds
of things were traced in Sanskrit.

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:44.799
All this I was amazed. What a culture they
had! In what culture they lived! It’s something,

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.110
you know, unbelievable. While in India there
are many people who don’t know what is Kundalini.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:56.230
If you tell them Kundalini, they think Kundalini
means horoscope. Especially in the North they

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:03.230
have no idea of Kundalini. But here are the
people who have really, have lived in a culture

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:10.909
for thousands of years, and they said this
was before Christ three thousand years. Can

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:12.950
you imagine? Before Christ, three thousand.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:19.950
And, so we too had civilizations in India,
like Harapa and all that of that time. But

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:27.100
they said India is the source of spirituality.
That magazine, I was amazed at it and the

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:34.840
way it was done. And the Mooladhara and the
Agnya Chakra and all that done so well. Maybe

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:41.820
they might have seen it. They might not have
got Realization but they talked about Realization

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:48.100
and also about achieving Self-hood. This was
so many years back.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.409
But then they said, “The Christian religion
came and they told us, ‘It’s all nonsense,

00:22:53.409 --> 00:22:58.250
have nothing to do with it.’” As they
told Me also in Greece that they had Athena

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:04.889
and Primordial Mother and all that. But they
said, “No Mother, nothing. Better stop it.”

00:23:04.889 --> 00:23:11.889
So it was all cancelled and nobody looked
at it. But can you imagine that so many years

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
back it existed in that Ukraine? Such a beautiful
culture of spirituality.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:26.510
First time I went to Ukraine we had people
there. There was a Chernobyl, you know that,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:33.950
was a big explosion and they were all - like
somebody had these fingers cut out or you

00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:39.779
can say, attached to each other. Somebody
had boils all over the body. Somebody’s

00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:44.990
nose was turned like that and horrible looking
like lepers they were, all of them, those

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:51.990
who came to the program. But then this time,
more than this were the people there in Ukraine,

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:59.309
I must tell you, much more than that. The
whole hall was full, the three tier was full,

00:23:59.309 --> 00:24:05.840
the passages were full and still the people
outside were standing. And they said, “We

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.100
were the ones who suffered from this and now
look at us we are completely cured.” You

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:17.799
won’t believe, I never touched anyone. I
was there only once, they came to My program

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:22.059
and they got cured.

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:27.759
So this sensitivity that they had. I used
to wonder why these Russians and Ukrainians

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:34.759
are so sensitive to spirituality. Then I realized
that these people who have got spirituality

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000
is ancient. From ancient times they were practising
this. And we had Macchindranath, Gorakhnath

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:51.190
- all these people. But nobody practiced Kundalini
awakening to this extent that it was in every

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:58.190
village they used to make the paintings about
Mooladhara, about this another Agnya Chakra

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:06.130
very clearly. And in the Agnya Chakra was
Ing and Ang of the Chinese, can you imagine?

00:25:08.519 --> 00:25:14.179
After discovering that, I really felt that
in the world there must be lots of people

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:21.179
like that. Now in Colombia I have seen also,
they have the same Kundalini and a Kumba and

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:26.990
everything. I think that’s even more than
that. Three, four thousand years back before

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:33.990
Christ. So what we find, that we had all this
knowledge in all these countries and is still,

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:47.070
that knowledge is still, working in the minds
of the people. They are very introspective

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:54.070
and also they know a lot about the sun. It
is this kind of sensitivity comes only when,

00:26:04.009 --> 00:26:11.009
basically in the roots of that country you
have exposure to spirituality. It’s a kind

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:18.630
of a miraculous revelation one could see there.
How they knew everything about Kundalini,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:29.110
about the Primordial Mother, about this happening,
about spirituality and what happens to a person

00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:33.750
when he becomes a realized soul.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:40.750
The speciality I saw about them, they’re
extremely humble people. To them I am really,

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:49.139
I don’t know, how they bow to Me and it’s,
sometimes I just can’t imagine how these

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:54.210
people have such sense of spirituality and
such peace.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:27:01.210
When they had this coup, I asked them, “Aren’t
you worried? This coup is here and I don’t

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.590
know what will happen to your country. Aren’t
you worried?”

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:10.850
They said, “Mother why should we worry?
After all we are in the Kingdom of God. We

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:17.850
are not living in Russia, we are living in
the Kingdom of God. So why should we worry?”

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:26.669
And meeting such nice people there, such sensitive
people to spirituality. They have thrown away

00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:33.070
practically all the false gurus, all the false
gurus. And for Me they showed such respect

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:37.779
and such care. They had this conference only
for Me.

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:44.779
So now why I’m telling you all this, that
now you all have got Realization. You have

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:51.870
now felt your Spirit and you have entered
into the Kingdom of God, no doubt. But now

00:27:55.899 --> 00:28:02.899
you must understand that this power that you
have, what it does to you. What it creates

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:14.080
in you. The most important thing is by this
power you become thoughtlessly aware. That

00:28:21.899 --> 00:28:28.899
is you come in the present. To achieve the
present is an impossible task. So you, once

00:28:35.419 --> 00:28:41.889
you are in thoughtless awareness what happens
that no thoughts bombard your mind. Wherever

00:28:41.889 --> 00:28:48.659
you may be, you may be in America, you may
be in any place. You are not bombarded by

00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:50.049
thoughts.

00:28:50.049 --> 00:28:57.049
So, what does that mean? Into very simple
language we can say, it means that you do

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:07.220
not reflect. You do not have a reflecting
mind. Now this is the basic problem of Sahaja

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:17.190
Yogis of today, which one should try to conquer.
That you do not reflect. That’s the only

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:26.600
way you can achieve your steadiness. For example
I have seen people, for nothing at all they’ll

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:37.470
just start laughing, nothing at all. They
see somebody, immediately they react – “This

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:46.059
was nice but not so good.” They start giving
their opinions, especially in the West, about

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:54.190
everything. Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable
and start telling what is best and what is

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:03.860
not the best, what is not good. And once they
start saying something like that, mind becomes

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:12.000
reflective. If the mind is not reflective,
then you are thoughtless awareness. Watch

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000
anything, just you watch. Just witness. You
should not reflect. If you are using your

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:25.279
mental power, then this power subsides.

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:32.279
This is a very common defect with people because,
I think, you people are more intelligent,

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:39.039
you think. Maybe, I think, you are well educated,
might be. I don’t know, whatever you think.

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:46.039
But this reflecting mind is a very dangerous
thing for spirituality. You’ll never grow.

00:30:46.769 --> 00:30:53.769
And then with the reflecting mind, you have
different emotions with something you reflect

00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:00.820
on somebody. Now if it’s your son or daughter
or something, you get identified. Identification

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:10.190
with some is artificial. It’s not in reality.
But because this mind reflects, it identifies.

00:31:13.179 --> 00:31:18.830
Now many identifications you have dropped
out. For example your bias about religion,

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:25.830
about races, about maybe nationalities, you
have dropped out. But still I would say, the

00:31:27.499 --> 00:31:33.620
reflecting mind still acts and this is the
greatest hurdle for the progress of Sahaja

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.820
Yogis of today.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:41.820
I’ve been thinking, “Why is it the reflecting
mind is so active in Sahaja Yogis of today?”

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:51.539
If you could stop reflecting, immediately
you establish yourself in the ocean of peace.

00:31:55.519 --> 00:32:02.519
You watch something, just watch. There’s
no ripple of thought in your mind. Then you

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:11.669
become extremely creative. You become extremely
dynamic, you become extremely compassionate.

00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:18.029
You have no fear. Some people think, “If
you are compassionate you see this man might

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:25.029
lynch me”. You have no fear. All virtues
that you have to enjoy you can only enjoy

00:32:25.809 --> 00:32:32.809
when you do not reflect. That means that you
leave everything to the Divine. You are not

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:42.600
in charge. You don’t see that you have to
be reflecting on something.

00:32:43.139 --> 00:32:50.139
This is the greatest power you have got, is
not to reflect, not to look at somebody with

00:32:52.379 --> 00:32:57.749
that kind of thing. I have seen this is still
there lingering. Perhaps I never told you

00:32:57.749 --> 00:33:04.749
about it, maybe one of the reasons. I don’t
say that it’s only your fault but maybe

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:12.610
Mine, because I couldn’t find what was exactly
wrong, that is the reflection that you have

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.129
about others.

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:25.129
Now I told you, have introspection. For introspection
also it can be reflection, but that at least

00:33:29.399 --> 00:33:36.019
gives you idea as to where you are. But with
that psychologically you can become extremely

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:43.019
depressed. You can condemn yourself. Then
you may not understand yourself as a personality

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:50.730
that you are and you’ll go on, sort of,
losing your vibrations, losing your power.

00:33:54.259 --> 00:33:58.720
Because you are not control of yourself.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:05.720
So introspection, also, if it brings about
depression and demeaning of your personality,

00:34:06.929 --> 00:34:13.690
best is not to introspect also. Because all
these mental activities, I have seen, create

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:20.690
problems. But in a state where you are thoughtlessly
aware, introspection comes to you automatically.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:31.720
You see it automatically. You understand it
automatically. You do not think about it,

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:39.220
it just comes to you. The whole picture comes
to you and you are at peace with yourself.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:49.940
You are never in turmoil, never in trouble.
Then you don’t get angry. Then you do not

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:57.119
argue, then you do not discuss, but you become
as if dropped in to the ocean of awareness

00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:08.589
and you don’t have to worry as to solve
something. When you are reflecting, then you

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:15.670
find that this power works.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:22.430
Now it becomes very contradictory to say that
you have to project and you don’t have to

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:29.430
reflect. Now when we reflect we absorb. When
we reflect on something, we absorb that thing.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:38.260
And mostly our attention goes to the defects
of others, “This person is no good, that

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:43.520
is not good, this is, her hair is not all
right, the sari’s not all right.” This,

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:50.520
that and all nonsense. So what are we doing,
we are absorbing all the bad things also.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:58.690
Now when you start admiration of something.
Then what happens that you may not get the

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:08.790
good things but at least you are on a better
line. But still, the admiration in thoughtless

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:17.050
awareness is really very deep. I saw this
in the eyes of this great scientist. Absolutely

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:24.819
he was just one with Me, and his eyes were
like an ocean of peace. He was just looking

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:35.420
at Me, and for quite some time and then he
came to his thoughts and he told Me that “This

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.980
is what we can do with Your photograph.”

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:47.980
So the depth in you will only come when you
do not reflect. But it’s very common with

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:53.530
human beings, specially in the West, “this
carpet is no good, that is no good, this smell

00:36:53.530 --> 00:37:00.530
is coming, that is there,” always trying
to judge others, judge other things. This

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:09.280
is important? What is so important? If you
are sitting in the garden of heavens what

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:15.770
does it matter where you are sitting, what
you are doing?

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:22.770
This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves
of thoughts in our mind. I have already, once,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:31.740
described it by drawing. How the energy that
falls on the right side goes to the left side

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:41.050
and the falls on the left goes to the right.
Crosses over because of two types of cells

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:48.440
we have. Then out of this energy that goes
to the right, the energy that goes to the

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:55.440
left it is sucked in partly into the sympathetic.
Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:06.609
That is the way it goes on reflecting. Now
if you can suck in all that energy and put

00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:13.609
it on our sympathetic, then all our energies
will be thousand fold much more. We’ll not

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:21.160
be tired, we’ll not be unhappy, we’ll
be able to stand lots of nonsense. But we’ll

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.660
not call it a nonsense, we’ll not think
it’s a bad thing, so it has no effect on

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.670
us.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:37.670
This quality we have to develop. I would say
with this, today’s special celebration of

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:46.190
Navaratri. Like yesterday you saw the Durga’s
nine forms also. In that is one is Kushmanda.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:57.210
As this was told that you absorb all the filth
within yourself, in your stomach. But Devi

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:06.380
does that, not you. What a Devi can do, you
should not do. That’s Her job, that She’s

00:39:08.559 --> 00:39:15.559
supposed to do these things, not you. What
you have to do is to only be in silence so

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:24.520
that you absorb whatever will increase that
silence, will increase your depth. Devi will

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:31.790
look after all the other, rest of the things.
She will look after the, all the filth, all

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:38.790
the anger, all the temper, all the everything
that’s going on in this world. She will

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:46.130
absorb all that, but what you have to do is
to just enjoy everything that is pure.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:54.319
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond
your mind. With your mind you can never enjoy.

00:39:54.319 --> 00:40:01.319
It’s like a big load. It will not act, it
will not help. Enjoyment comes when you are

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:08.920
in complete silence, in a rippleless lake.
The reflection of all the joy that is created

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:17.900
on the shores of that lake are completely
reflected, they are not deflected. If there

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:24.710
were ripples it would have been a different
image altogether and would have been something

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:29.530
nowhere near the image of reality.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:36.530
So one must have a mind which is kept lower
than reality. In the reality actually it is

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:48.329
nothing but peace and joy. Now a mother’s
desire is always that children should have

00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:55.329
nothing but peace and joy, no sufferings,
no starvation, no ordeals, nothing. They must

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:05.190
just enjoy. Now those days are gone. But even
to enjoy this, even to live in that complete

00:41:10.119 --> 00:41:17.119
peaceful state you have to be non-reflecting.
Now you watch yourself, you’ll be amazed

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:31.890
how much reflecting you are. When Devi is
doing all the job for you. When Paramchaitanya,

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:39.270
I don’t know how many things It is doing,
is trying to fill up the whole atmosphere

00:41:42.049 --> 00:41:49.049
with It’s activity. What is your activity,
should be to stop your mental activity.

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:56.329
You’ll be amazed in that state only, you
will grow. With that growth only you will

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:04.150
become like this scientist. How the contradiction
now is that when you have your depth you can

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:12.990
project your depth, not your mind. Sometimes
when I say “project,” people think it

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:19.930
is a projection of the mind. No. you have
to project that depth, that reality that is

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:26.930
within you. For that you don’t have to think,
you don’t have to plan, it will just work.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:33.980
But you’ll be the instrument for that projection.
It is nothing subtle. It is very simple to

00:42:35.079 --> 00:42:42.079
understand. Like I’m talking on this instrument,
all right? Now if this instrument is absolutely

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:53.490
all right, there’s no problem in it, it
will be peaceful. But if this is full of ideas

00:42:55.049 --> 00:43:02.049
and thoughts like our brain is, whatever I’m
saying will not be the same that will be broadcasted.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:13.720
In the same way, when our mind is full of
turmoil and arguments and what you can say,

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:21.170
comments, or we can also say the reflection,
then what happens is that this mind gets into

00:43:22.809 --> 00:43:29.809
like a whirlpool of disturbances and it cannot
project itself fully because it is disturbed.

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:47.690
It is not a normal thing. So now you’ll
understand there is no contradiction.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:54.690
You can only project yourself when you are
absolutely peaceful. And this is what we have

00:43:54.700 --> 00:44:01.700
to learn. This is Navaratri’s great days
are here and that you should know that it

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:10.829
starts, actually, in the western world from
the 21st, in the equinox, after the equinox,

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:19.960
in September. There are two Navaratri’s
we have, you see, one starts now and one starts

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:27.680
after the second equinox. Now in this equinox,
Mother Mary’s birthday is there, equinox.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:37.640
And that’s why people celebrate Her birthday.
They don’t know why She was born on equinox.

00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:44.809
For the balance. Then, you see, because nothing
was explained about the lives of these great

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:54.720
incarnations, people use them the way they
like. Because they have seen miracles with

00:44:54.720 --> 00:45:01.720
them, so they do not try to understand why
this equinox is there and why this is celebrated.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:12.740
Now I was told in Iran, this is the time they
have the new year. That means the Muslims

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:20.790
observe this as a new year, so when Navaratri
starts is the new year. That means it’s

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:28.520
the twelfth month for them and so many things
are suggestive of that, that why should it

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:36.000
be twelve months. Why should the Goddess be
born at twelve o’clock. All this has a special

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.000
meaning and which you can find out. But only
possible when you are not reflecting. This

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:51.470
is what is the state in which you are really
in connection with the all-pervading Power.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:59.030
Otherwise you are not there, you are not one
with that state. To be one with that state

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:06.510
you have to be absolutely silent within yourself.
For the Goddess, She is silent. There’s

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:14.049
a fight on, She’s silent, because She’s
so confident.

00:46:14.049 --> 00:46:21.049
She knows about Her powers. She knows Maheshasura
or any asura cannot trouble Her, cannot touch

00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:29.680
Her. She knows what are their powers are and
She knows all Her powers. So She doesn’t

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:36.680
have to be disturbed by anything. She’s
not disturbed because She’s really the personification

00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:44.609
of this peace state, where She’s so powerful.
She doesn’t have to know about Her powers.

00:46:45.609 --> 00:46:52.609
She doesn’t have to ask the powers to exert,
they just work, automatically. This is the

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:59.809
state in which, you will be amazed, so many
things happen, unknowingly, without your doing

00:47:02.339 --> 00:47:09.339
anything. And that is what we call as coincidences,
but actually it is not coincidence. It is

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:17.119
the state in which we are in a thoughtless
awareness, and then the Paramachaitanya is

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:27.990
related to us. Absolutely related. We are
there. And that works out everything for us.

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:35.160
So in Sahaja Yoga, this time, as you know
about the Goddess, what She has done, so much

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:42.160
work for years together. Now you all have
become realized souls and you must understand

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:50.390
that complete confidence in yourself, complete
understanding about yourself, never to have

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:59.140
any fear, never to have any thoughts which
can bombard your mind. At that state you are

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.770
the most powerful person.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:10.770
I hope, for this Navaratri, you will realize
what work the Goddess has done for you, how

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:20.680
much She's worked hard, how much She's fought,
She’s been fighting with these horrible

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:29.190
devils and rakshasas. And, sometimes I feel
now, these devils are within us, they're not

00:48:33.789 --> 00:48:40.789
outside, and that comes to us because we reflect
too much on things.

00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:48.920
If you talk to any one of the western people
you're amazed, as if all the media they have

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:55.130
on their heads. They know about each and every
person, what he did, what was this, what was

00:48:55.130 --> 00:49:02.130
that. But he's not worried. He doesn't think
how he can improve it, how you can work it

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:07.549
out.

00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:14.549
At this state of thoughtless awareness you
encompass the whole universe, and at that

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:23.500
state, this power works wherever the problem
may be. So we have to understand our value,

00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:33.579
that we have this power within ourself, and
this is to be respected and to give credit

00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:40.299
to the Goddess because She's done so much
work for us that She should not feel that

00:49:40.299 --> 00:49:47.299
it's now they got Realization just for a song
and they are not bothered, they don't know

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.109
how to develop it.

00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:57.109
She will not be in any way hurt but Her work,
what She has done, we have to see, we have

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:08.720
to understand and we have to have a feeling
that somehow, as we now have got enlightenment,

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:19.190
we should try to be people as complete instruments
of that power. That's only possible when you

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:28.920
don't have your own ideas, your own interference.
Complete instrument, just like as I said,

00:50:29.849 --> 00:50:36.849
this instrument has to be perfectly all right,
otherwise it cannot work.

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:41.140
Thank you very much. May God bless you!
