WEBVTT

02:35.291 --> 02:36.671
It's a great day

02:37.951 --> 02:39.751
for Me to come to Italy

02:40.651 --> 02:41.971
to celebrate

02:43.031 --> 02:44.191
Ganesh Puja

02:56.441 --> 02:57.441
The nature

02:57.691 --> 02:59.223
which we see around

02:59.541 --> 03:01.971
is the blessing of the Ganesha only

03:01.971 --> 03:05.563
because He is the one who prays to the Mother Earth

03:06.101 --> 03:06.991
that

03:06.991 --> 03:09.951
she should grant her blessings upon

03:09.951 --> 03:10.951
human beings

03:28.371 --> 03:29.621
It is He

03:30.331 --> 03:31.871
who moulds

03:33.061 --> 03:35.581
all the elements of the nature

03:43.991 --> 03:46.811
and moulds them to create life.

03:51.221 --> 03:55.111
As you call them, these are all carbohydrates.

04:00.601 --> 04:04.661
Now the carbohydrates have got carbon and hydrogen.

04:10.611 --> 04:12.601
Carbon is coming

04:13.341 --> 04:14.801
from Shri Ganesh

04:15.361 --> 04:17.631
and hydrogen is coming from Mahakali.

04:24.591 --> 04:27.641
And that is how this universe is created

04:28.261 --> 04:31.181
in this beautiful way all around us.

04:38.881 --> 04:39.881
Now,

04:40.081 --> 04:45.501
these carbohydrates need oxygen which is given to us by the Sun,

04:45.801 --> 04:46.971
by the right side.

04:58.581 --> 05:01.001
Thus, you know that in the night

05:01.441 --> 05:04.371
these trees emit hydrogen

05:04.866 --> 05:09.146
and in the day time they generate oxygen.

05:20.406 --> 05:24.146
This is all the trick of Shri Ganesha who is sitting in between

05:30.201 --> 05:32.521
Now it is He who becomes the Sun.

05:36.721 --> 05:39.341
He ascents from the

05:40.351 --> 05:42.231
deep down seat

05:43.101 --> 05:44.601
below the Kundalini,

05:45.171 --> 05:47.641
rises on the left hand side of Mahakali,

05:48.611 --> 05:51.681
goes up and settles in the Surya,

05:52.931 --> 05:54.201
that is the Agnya.

06:09.801 --> 06:13.511
So, Mahakali which is the Primordial Energy

06:15.231 --> 06:18.231
is absolutely transcended by Him.

06:27.331 --> 06:29.561
As the child of Mahakali

06:29.931 --> 06:33.061
He is absolutely dedicated and devoted to Her.

06:40.351 --> 06:44.561
And that is how He is the master of the Mahakali power,Lord of.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.221
That means He is the Lord of subconscious mind.

06:57.171 --> 07:00.041
He is the Lord of all the 'jadas'.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.241
Jada,

07:02.941 --> 07:04.471
that is, you can say the dead.

07:05.471 --> 07:08.411
Not the dead but 'jada' is the one

07:08.411 --> 07:11.841
matter which has not - matter and the dead.

07:16.471 --> 07:18.231
You must understand the word 'jada'.

07:18.231 --> 07:23.546
Very important. Jada means all that is the matter which is not moving,

07:29.146 --> 07:31.946
without life.

07:34.806 --> 07:37.186
So He can transcend

07:37.801 --> 07:38.801
this

07:39.401 --> 07:40.661
great power

07:41.981 --> 07:44.481
and become the lord of that power

07:44.831 --> 07:45.831
by one

07:46.786 --> 07:49.566
very small little wisdom He has.

08:08.746 --> 08:11.246
Now that small little wisdom is

08:11.731 --> 08:12.731
surrender.

08:18.621 --> 08:24.071
And the surrender is to be understood in it's proper sense.

08:29.151 --> 08:30.191
Surrender

08:30.561 --> 08:32.971
is signifying,

08:33.686 --> 08:36.846
no giving up anything.

08:44.126 --> 08:48.486
Because whenever you try to give up or take up you are using your ego.

08:59.246 --> 09:00.526
But surrendering means

09:00.531 --> 09:02.271
giving up the ego itself.

09:09.501 --> 09:12.711
So, all the ideas of giving up something

09:12.711 --> 09:15.411
or taking in something, disappear.

09:25.471 --> 09:28.381
Keep your eyes open because you see I'm talking about

09:28.381 --> 09:31.141
the subconscious  and I don't want you to keep your eyes close, that's a sign

09:31.146 --> 09:32.926
of going into subconscious.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.386
This has to be recorded in your conscious mind.

09:51.171 --> 09:52.891
Now when we surrender,

09:56.231 --> 09:59.371
we have to see how Ritambara Pragnya,

09:59.371 --> 10:00.711
which is the power

10:01.591 --> 10:04.701
of Mahalakshmi, the essence of Mahalakshmi,

10:04.701 --> 10:05.951
how She helps you.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.931
Like situations we should accept

10:27.841 --> 10:30.741
Say, this morning, it was Amavasya,

10:31.551 --> 10:34.751
it's the day when if you worship

10:35.811 --> 10:39.791
Shri Ganesha, it's very deep.So, I wanted to have

10:40.151 --> 10:44.201
from the end of Amavasya to start the puja.

10:58.921 --> 11:01.511
Now, that's why the water finished;

11:01.511 --> 11:02.721
it would not start

11:03.366 --> 11:04.706
I could not take my bath.

11:12.986 --> 11:19.346
Because I have said- if I had said that we'll have puja at lunch time, many would have felt, "Oh God, now no lunch".

11:33.041 --> 11:35.971
But that was the right time to start the puja,

11:35.971 --> 11:37.171
so there was no water

11:37.966 --> 11:39.966
and I had to wait for the water.

11:48.186 --> 11:50.626
And a simple thing like that happened

11:51.266 --> 11:53.586
but it achieved

11:54.641 --> 11:56.731
the right time.

12:09.421 --> 12:11.581
Now when you start

12:11.581 --> 12:13.661
accepting situations,

12:15.261 --> 12:18.261
then you realize that all the situations

12:18.261 --> 12:19.571
are created

12:20.821 --> 12:24.911
not by anything else but Ritambara Pragnya Herself.

12:42.031 --> 12:46.201
But ego is such a thing, that it wants to do the way it likes.

12:58.171 --> 13:03.901
So people start doing things against the plans of the Divine.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.591
And all the time they are in friction

13:12.926 --> 13:15.226
and in trouble, going against.

13:24.186 --> 13:28.006
And thus, they have to take a double speed to fight.

13:33.461 --> 13:37.991
But going against the Divine, we are going against our ascent.

13:44.321 --> 13:47.611
These egos develop as a result

13:47.921 --> 13:50.731
of our upbringing, atmosphere

13:51.561 --> 13:54.191
and as a natural idea to assert.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.401
These as our conditioning and our upbringing

14:00.751 --> 14:05.321
and also as a natural idea we have to assert others.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.266
Natural idea

14:38.626 --> 14:41.146
No assertion, assertion means pressing others,

14:41.611 --> 14:44.031
dominating others.

14:46.491 --> 14:49.461
Now this domination part come to us

14:49.721 --> 14:53.021
from the matter because the matter dominates the Spirit.

15:03.211 --> 15:06.121
It dominates us through giving us comfort,

15:06.281 --> 15:08.741
false notions, false ideas.

15:17.301 --> 15:19.711
It dominates through our desires

15:23.501 --> 15:25.651
It dominates through lust and greed.

15:33.371 --> 15:36.151
Also it dominates us

15:37.041 --> 15:38.421
through a very

15:38.811 --> 15:40.171
subtle way

15:40.561 --> 15:43.601
by possessing us through bhoots as we call them.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.291
And this is what

15:59.691 --> 16:00.691
we see how

16:01.131 --> 16:02.941
Shri Ganesha ascended

16:03.801 --> 16:08.271
as Christ to show us how we have to ascend

16:08.611 --> 16:11.561
out of all this mire of matter.

16:28.131 --> 16:33.761
As He is ascending we catch hold of this feet and we also ascend with Him.

16:42.691 --> 16:45.151
Though He is a child, He is very powerful

16:45.151 --> 16:47.941
and he can take us to that level

16:48.051 --> 16:50.991
where the Spirit resides.

17:00.031 --> 17:03.321
Now the first thing that we have to know is about sex.

17:10.571 --> 17:14.591
In the west, sex has become an obsession with people

17:17.486 --> 17:20.206
as if it's a religion.

17:22.686 --> 17:26.806
And if they cannot be sexually active

17:26.986 --> 17:30.601
or if they are not having any sex activities,

17:30.981 --> 17:32.731
they think they are all wasted.

17:33.371 --> 17:36.471
They are good for nothing.

17:42.231 --> 17:48.221
The whole atmosphere is built up like that through your medias, through your televisions

17:48.221 --> 17:51.051
All kinds of things are put in to your head to feel

17:51.051 --> 17:53.766
that your inferior if you are not dealing with sex.

18:13.666 --> 18:16.311
And when we get attached to

18:17.401 --> 18:22.771
this kind of a stupid idea that our life is only meant for sex enjoyment,

18:23.906 --> 18:28.006
we start descending downward instead of descending upward.

18:36.146 --> 18:38.366
What is that? Lizard

18:38.881 --> 18:41.371
I don't like them very much

18:42.431 --> 18:43.431
Alright, doesn't matter

18:44.171 --> 18:46.871
It's a very different type of a lizard than an Indian

18:47.461 --> 18:48.471
Better looking

18:50.291 --> 18:51.291
Yogi : Smaller

18:56.081 --> 18:57.121
Ah, she's green.

18:58.646 --> 19:02.546
You don't get green. Alright so

19:13.966 --> 19:15.806
So, to descend down

19:16.511 --> 19:18.061
is very easy,

19:18.811 --> 19:20.681
to fall is the easiest.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.431
And when

19:22.941 --> 19:25.931
the idea of sex all the time hover our mind,

19:26.681 --> 19:29.361
our attention gets so much filled with it,

19:29.361 --> 19:31.931
that even with our eyes, with our thoughts,

19:31.931 --> 19:35.571
with our mind, our head, everything it is nothing but

19:35.926 --> 19:38.426
just this filth in our head.

20:03.346 --> 20:05.566
So, for the young people, when they get married

20:05.941 --> 20:10.321
the best thing is, they should realize the importance of sex

20:10.791 --> 20:13.941
is not so great.

20:27.281 --> 20:28.711
And they should start

20:29.071 --> 20:32.141
understanding that it is not a sin

20:32.141 --> 20:33.901
but it is not also everything.

20:41.401 --> 20:43.981
Then also women must know that

20:43.981 --> 20:47.071
they are on this earth to give

20:47.781 --> 20:51.051
place for the Realized souls to be born.

21:00.401 --> 21:03.781
And in the name of Ganesha, they should have innocent children.

21:08.231 --> 21:13.611
But when these Realized sould are born in the west, they do not keep their pure form

21:13.611 --> 21:16.541
because the parents are in a funny shape.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.761
And though the Ganesha has done all the best

21:31.761 --> 21:35.031
that is possible to get the best children

21:35.221 --> 21:37.971
in the womb of the Realized mothers,

21:38.361 --> 21:41.611
they get really absolutely affected.

21:56.541 --> 21:59.601
And we start hurting them by our

21:59.601 --> 22:02.901
ill behaviour, by our wrong ideas.

22:13.581 --> 22:19.111
So when you are pregnant, one should read Ganesha's stotram,

22:19.111 --> 22:22.041
must do puja of Ganesha and try to remain pure

22:22.041 --> 22:23.901
as far as sex is concerned.

22:38.641 --> 22:41.091
Moreover, we start thinking about

22:41.091 --> 22:42.866
something that is so spontaneous.

22:52.326 --> 22:55.681
What is there to think about it? Just an Indian won't understand this

22:55.681 --> 23:00.151
they won't understand in the village what is there to think about sex, it's so spontaneous.

23:00.151 --> 23:02.206
It's like thinking about going to the bathroom.

23:17.586 --> 23:23.226
It's a joyless pursuit and imaginary ideas

23:31.111 --> 23:34.141
So one has to be very very alert,

23:34.371 --> 23:37.071
that we are now saints, we are Yogis

23:37.071 --> 23:40.171
and we are not going to waste our energy

23:40.171 --> 23:41.431
in this kind of a joyless pursuit.

23:54.921 --> 23:56.171
What is it there?

24:01.001 --> 24:02.001
What's it?

24:02.631 --> 24:04.101
It's a beetle, Ah

24:05.361 --> 24:07.371
can't be afraid of beetles.

24:10.566 --> 24:12.206
Alright, now

24:13.286 --> 24:19.226
when we understand our life as so important,

24:19.566 --> 24:21.726
for the imancipation of humanity,

24:22.811 --> 24:25.031
for giving light to others,

24:25.891 --> 24:31.251
for saving the whole world from the disaster, it is awaiting

24:31.911 --> 24:33.131
and we realize that.

24:47.061 --> 24:50.361
How can we waste?

24:50.531 --> 24:56.061
How can we waste our energy, our attention into such a

24:56.061 --> 24:57.361
spontaneous thing like that?

25:06.911 --> 25:09.151
Specially for old people

25:10.121 --> 25:13.001
there is no need to think about it anymore, forget it,

25:13.001 --> 25:15.171
you are very happy that you are alright there.

25:15.621 --> 25:19.061
Now, just devote your time to something great.

25:30.961 --> 25:33.101
Actually, I miss nothing, whatsoever.

25:40.641 --> 25:42.071
The spiritual joy

25:42.391 --> 25:44.401
is so much greater

25:44.711 --> 25:47.971
and it's so eternal that we should not seek all this.

25:47.971 --> 25:52.011
On the contrary, whenever such thoughts come in we should sublimate it.

26:08.831 --> 26:12.291
You will see once you start doing that, your

26:12.401 --> 26:15.191
your sensitivity, your perception

26:15.886 --> 26:18.546
joy will be thousand fold.

26:32.566 --> 26:33.146
And gradually

26:33.151 --> 26:34.801
you will get over it

26:41.201 --> 26:42.891
because it is such a

26:44.681 --> 26:46.221
temporary pleasure,

26:46.681 --> 26:48.811
that's why people run after it.

26:48.811 --> 26:51.651
If it was something of eternal nature, one would not

26:51.761 --> 26:52.761
again go to it.

27:03.371 --> 27:08.501
But it is in human nature, it is natural, so

27:08.501 --> 27:14.471
it is being sanctified and one can have it till you are young.

27:14.471 --> 27:17.901
But then gradually, you must make your pure

27:18.541 --> 27:21.431
existence so purified

27:21.431 --> 27:23.981
that they should not enter into your mind at all.

27:44.861 --> 27:51.691
So when you catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesha, which are very tiny sweet little things,

27:52.181 --> 27:54.901
you should know that you should be yourself little lightweight,

27:54.901 --> 27:58.831
otherwise, if you are having all these problems upon yourself,

27:59.301 --> 28:01.811
He wouldn't like and He might just  again

28:01.921 --> 28:02.931
throw you down.

28:18.306 --> 28:23.641
And that your attention should be purified by attention towards Shri Ganesh

28:32.001 --> 28:34.801
Only people who are

28:34.801 --> 28:37.571
this kind really also enjoy sex,

28:37.571 --> 28:40.561
otherwise they cannot because they have so many perversions in their heads,

28:40.566 --> 28:42.906
I don't know what are they upto.

28:57.006 --> 28:58.026
And that is why

28:58.271 --> 28:59.541
they rise above,

29:00.591 --> 29:04.441
that is why they get fed up with it

29:04.591 --> 29:05.711
after sometime.

29:15.321 --> 29:20.791
And they mature properly in their own age, otherwise you will find even

29:20.791 --> 29:22.201
eighty years old people

29:23.011 --> 29:25.881
shaking their hand on their sticks you see,

29:26.091 --> 29:28.471
still looking at young girls,

29:28.471 --> 29:29.661
it's something I cannot understand.

29:44.091 --> 29:45.971
And they look so stupid,

29:46.741 --> 29:48.351
they look so stupid.

29:48.706 --> 29:49.866
Everybody laughs at them.

29:54.906 --> 29:56.906
And young people make fun of them.

29:59.861 --> 30:03.101
But they feel as if they have become

30:03.101 --> 30:05.961
something like a hero or

30:05.961 --> 30:08.111
in that old age suddenly.

30:15.791 --> 30:17.851
Like they showed once a

30:19.181 --> 30:20.181
film

30:20.871 --> 30:24.331
of all the very, very old eighty, eighty above,

30:25.031 --> 30:28.181
actors and actresses coming to do shake dance

30:28.511 --> 30:31.221
in a party. To do shake dance

30:31.866 --> 30:33.906
in a party.

30:43.921 --> 30:46.351
And from the limousine, they got down

30:46.351 --> 30:47.911
since then they were shaking.

30:53.521 --> 30:59.711
And when they came and tried to show they were very much in love and all that, looking

30:59.711 --> 31:04.371
so stupid that those who watched them were laughing and were rolling with laughter.

31:19.471 --> 31:21.871
It is so ridiculously clownish,

31:22.751 --> 31:25.301
but they said we are honest.

31:39.691 --> 31:42.081
So even if you do these things

31:42.526 --> 31:48.406
openly or with secrecy or whichever way you do it, it's stupid.

31:57.246 --> 31:58.506
And that is how,

31:59.011 --> 32:02.271
when you are not matured of your age

32:03.131 --> 32:06.031
you are not respected by your children,respected by

32:06.031 --> 32:10.321
anybody who is younger. He thinks you are stupid because you are not matured enough.

32:21.281 --> 32:24.161
Now when the fruits are

32:24.631 --> 32:26.321
in the flower form,

32:26.881 --> 32:31.051
that time all the fertilization takes place.

32:32.101 --> 32:35.321
Then at the fruit time they grow as fruits and not as flowers anymore.

32:48.821 --> 32:51.641
Flowers become fruits

32:53.361 --> 32:56.321
At the time of flower stage, there is fertilization,

32:56.321 --> 32:59.731
but not at the time of fruit, you see. Fruit trys to grow

33:00.066 --> 33:03.226
Fertilization is where they

33:29.846 --> 33:30.626
So this is what,

33:30.631 --> 33:33.601
that maturity is very important

33:33.606 --> 33:38.386
to reach, that is only possible if you really catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesh.

33:51.386 --> 33:55.351
So you remain innocent even in your old age.

34:02.001 --> 34:04.871
With all this understanding,

34:05.541 --> 34:08.371
Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

34:09.191 --> 34:10.791
by which we mature.

34:17.361 --> 34:18.361
So that thing is there

34:19.111 --> 34:20.611
in the room, I think I have got that thing

34:21.111 --> 34:23.361
decoration.

34:25.631 --> 34:26.731
Now the people

34:28.111 --> 34:31.051
who are indulging into lust

34:31.711 --> 34:32.731
have to

34:33.231 --> 34:37.371
see that they mature in their understanding.

34:47.931 --> 34:50.921
Then the people who are too much possessive

34:52.041 --> 34:56.981
of their things, of their possessions, of their

34:57.866 --> 35:07.666
children must also understand that Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

35:08.086 --> 35:09.126
to understand,

35:10.151 --> 35:12.681
that this is not yours.

35:33.366 --> 35:38.646
So what is carbon is nothing but a burnt wood, that is

35:38.786 --> 35:40.506
everything is burnt away.

35:52.026 --> 35:53.226
The wisdom that you get

35:53.461 --> 35:59.741
is that everything that you see as your own is not yours.

35:59.941 --> 36:06.401
Everything you have to leave here and go away. You can't take even this paper with you.

36:22.091 --> 36:24.381
So why are we attached to them,

36:24.891 --> 36:30.651
let us use it for its own purpose for expressing our joy.

36:40.401 --> 36:42.391
Now, I'll give you a very

36:43.901 --> 36:45.271
beautiful example.

36:48.851 --> 36:52.071
See now how Ritambara Pragnya works.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.991
See, this necklace that you see

36:58.991 --> 37:00.806
was made in Italy

37:07.326 --> 37:09.186
by some realized soul.

37:11.981 --> 37:12.981
Then,

37:13.781 --> 37:15.361
this necklace,

37:16.261 --> 37:19.411
I don't know how it went to India.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.011
Now,

37:27.791 --> 37:30.871
the Australians wanted to give me

37:31.171 --> 37:32.171
a

37:32.561 --> 37:33.921
Mangal sutra of

37:34.451 --> 37:36.541
diamond like this, the other one I have.

37:44.471 --> 37:47.541
And they had collected ten thousand rupees,

37:47.601 --> 37:50.861
but even half of this size we could not buy

37:50.861 --> 37:53.991
because there was only one shop open on a sunday.

37:54.251 --> 37:55.621
situation

38:07.761 --> 38:10.761
So I looked around and I found

38:10.761 --> 38:13.791
a very nice gold Mangal sutra

38:13.791 --> 38:18.721
made out of coral because Australia is Ganesha's land.

38:35.471 --> 38:38.491
I felt tremendous vibrations around,

38:38.491 --> 38:40.221
so I went on the back

38:41.751 --> 38:44.691
because they said, "it is very cheap". So, I said, " alright"

38:44.891 --> 38:47.221
And there this was placed

38:47.221 --> 38:49.331
and these earrings there.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.741
So, we bought all these,

38:52.421 --> 38:54.811
plus the Mangal sutra,

38:54.811 --> 38:57.781
plus one more piece which I have in coral

38:57.781 --> 38:58.781
in the same amount.

39:20.641 --> 39:23.731
It's not yet finished,

39:23.821 --> 39:26.391
then it was misplaced

39:26.811 --> 39:29.231
in Australia,it went into my box

39:29.231 --> 39:32.101
which was to come to London.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.666
So, I couldn't bring it to London

39:55.306 --> 39:56.946
Now, Thelma came

39:57.801 --> 39:59.251
from Australia

39:59.681 --> 40:01.881
and she brought it with her

40:01.881 --> 40:04.911
and it is now in Italy

40:04.911 --> 40:05.911
by the artist

40:06.331 --> 40:09.111
whose spirit could be seeing this

40:09.701 --> 40:12.651
to gratify him, not only that,

40:12.651 --> 40:16.111
but also that it is the day of Shri Ganesh

40:16.306 --> 40:17.686
from Australia.

40:41.626 --> 40:43.266
Yes, from Australia,

40:43.301 --> 40:46.261
this is sent as your brothers,

40:46.261 --> 40:49.381
the thing they bought made in Italy,

40:49.386 --> 40:52.906
on the day of Shri Ganesh. Can you have more combinations?

41:21.986 --> 41:23.326
Your brothers and sisters

41:23.441 --> 41:26.301
from Ganesha's place, you see, the Ganas

41:26.761 --> 41:28.421
have sent it to

41:28.821 --> 41:29.931
Devas here

41:30.801 --> 41:33.941
for the celebration, you are the Devas and they are the Ganas.

41:51.941 --> 41:52.941
And these are ten,

41:54.641 --> 41:57.051
ten, eleven and twelve.

41:57.621 --> 42:00.341
So this represents the heart,

42:02.591 --> 42:04.821
the dharma, ten

42:05.191 --> 42:06.191
and all

42:06.246 --> 42:08.506
put together is the heart.

42:13.846 --> 42:16.106
The whole of Europe

42:24.741 --> 42:28.131
and in addition to these two is the twelve, it's the heart : England.

42:36.591 --> 42:39.291
All are represented here

42:43.291 --> 42:46.281
Now you should be able to read through

42:46.961 --> 42:49.971
the beautiful working of

42:49.971 --> 42:52.131
Ritambara Pragnya which is very subtle.

42:52.541 --> 42:55.151
And then you'll start enjoying the little, little things

42:55.151 --> 42:58.001
it plays to make you very happy

42:58.331 --> 43:02.491
and to give you what some artist must have done it long time back,

43:03.591 --> 43:05.411
which his desire was

43:05.801 --> 43:06.801
to fulfill.

43:31.721 --> 43:34.631
No, this is also we should say,

43:34.631 --> 43:36.086
is the work of Shri Ganesha.

43:42.386 --> 43:47.526
He resides as Omkara in the Ritambara Pragnya.

43:52.666 --> 43:58.931
He resides on the electromagnetic forces as the vibrations in the matter,

44:05.691 --> 44:06.691
in every atom.

44:10.846 --> 44:16.826
He resides in every ripple of our emotions which gives us joy.

44:31.606 --> 44:34.766
And he resides

44:36.051 --> 44:39.211
as a beautiful decoration of the Kundalini because

44:39.211 --> 44:42.131
she has the red and gold colour just like my sari.

44:53.426 --> 44:55.706
So, as the colour of Kundalini he resides.

45:00.366 --> 45:01.446
But at Sahastrara,

45:03.071 --> 45:05.601
he becomes the joy.

45:10.691 --> 45:13.671
At Muladhara as the fragrance,

45:18.481 --> 45:21.421
and every memory of mine

45:21.421 --> 45:24.811
should give you fragrance because he is the Lord of memory.

45:34.181 --> 45:37.041
So, this is how he manages everything

45:37.041 --> 45:38.511
so beautifully.

45:44.521 --> 45:46.431
He is such a innocent

45:48.731 --> 45:51.171
person who plays around

45:51.411 --> 45:52.411
his beauty

45:52.706 --> 45:54.086
to make us happy.

46:05.406 --> 46:07.221
Our children should also make us very happy

46:07.226 --> 46:09.606
if we have brought them up properly.

46:16.966 --> 46:18.486
But if we have been

46:18.491 --> 46:21.181
all the time busy with lust and greed,

46:21.546 --> 46:23.346
the children cannot be good children.

46:35.586 --> 46:36.706
They cannot represent

46:37.011 --> 46:39.161
Ganesha tatwa as it should be.

46:47.431 --> 46:49.741
So, today is a great day

46:49.741 --> 46:52.581
that we are establishing Shri Ganesha

46:52.581 --> 46:53.851
in Italy.

47:03.261 --> 47:05.511
We did this in Switzerland

47:06.246 --> 47:07.246
and now in Italy.

47:12.546 --> 47:14.246
This should give you

47:14.411 --> 47:15.821
the power of innocence,

47:16.271 --> 47:19.231
the power of purity,

47:19.231 --> 47:20.231
the power of wisdom.

47:30.561 --> 47:33.711
It should give you the art of playfulness of joy.

47:46.121 --> 47:53.051
And that special quality of turning everything into something

47:53.241 --> 47:54.241
fragrant.

48:01.981 --> 48:03.911
May God bless you all.
