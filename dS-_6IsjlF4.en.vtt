00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:36.671
It's a great day

00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:39.751
for Me to come to Italy

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.971
to celebrate

00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:44.191
Ganesh Puja

00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:57.441
The nature

00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:59.223
which we see around

00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.971
is the blessing of the Ganesha only

00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:05.563
because He is the one who prays to the Mother Earth

00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:06.991
that

00:03:06.991 --> 00:03:09.951
she should grant her blessings upon

00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:10.951
human beings

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:29.621
It is He

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:31.871
who moulds

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:35.581
all the elements of the nature

00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.811
and moulds them to create life.

00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:55.111
As you call them, these are all carbohydrates.

00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:04.661
Now the carbohydrates have got carbon and hydrogen.

00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:12.601
Carbon is coming

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:14.801
from Shri Ganesh

00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:17.631
and hydrogen is coming from Mahakali.

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.641
And that is how this universe is created

00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:31.181
in this beautiful way all around us.

00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:39.881
Now,

00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:45.501
these carbohydrates need oxygen which is given to us by the Sun,

00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:46.971
by the right side.

00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:01.001
Thus, you know that in the night

00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:04.371
these trees emit hydrogen

00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:09.146
and in the day time they generate oxygen.

00:05:20.406 --> 00:05:24.146
This is all the trick of Shri Ganesha who is sitting in between

00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:32.521
Now it is He who becomes the Sun.

00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:39.341
He ascents from the

00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:42.231
deep down seat

00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:44.601
below the Kundalini,

00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:47.641
rises on the left hand side of Mahakali,

00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:51.681
goes up and settles in the Surya,

00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:54.201
that is the Agnya.

00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.511
So, Mahakali which is the Primordial Energy

00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:18.231
is absolutely transcended by Him.

00:06:27.331 --> 00:06:29.561
As the child of Mahakali

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.061
He is absolutely dedicated and devoted to Her.

00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:44.561
And that is how He is the master of the Mahakali power,Lord of.

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:53.221
That means He is the Lord of subconscious mind.

00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:00.041
He is the Lord of all the 'jadas'.

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:02.241
Jada,

00:07:02.941 --> 00:07:04.471
that is, you can say the dead.

00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:08.411
Not the dead but 'jada' is the one

00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:11.841
matter which has not - matter and the dead.

00:07:16.471 --> 00:07:18.231
You must understand the word 'jada'.

00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:23.546
Very important. Jada means all that is the matter which is not moving,

00:07:29.146 --> 00:07:31.946
without life.

00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:37.186
So He can transcend

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:38.801
this

00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:40.661
great power

00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:44.481
and become the lord of that power

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.831
by one

00:07:46.786 --> 00:07:49.566
very small little wisdom He has.

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:11.246
Now that small little wisdom is

00:08:11.731 --> 00:08:12.731
surrender.

00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:24.071
And the surrender is to be understood in it's proper sense.

00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:30.191
Surrender

00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:32.971
is signifying,

00:08:33.686 --> 00:08:36.846
no giving up anything.

00:08:44.126 --> 00:08:48.486
Because whenever you try to give up or take up you are using your ego.

00:08:59.246 --> 00:09:00.526
But surrendering means

00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:02.271
giving up the ego itself.

00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:12.711
So, all the ideas of giving up something

00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:15.411
or taking in something, disappear.

00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.381
Keep your eyes open because you see I'm talking about

00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.141
the subconscious  and I don't want you to keep your eyes close, that's a sign

00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:32.926
of going into subconscious.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:46.386
This has to be recorded in your conscious mind.

00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:52.891
Now when we surrender,

00:09:56.231 --> 00:09:59.371
we have to see how Ritambara Pragnya,

00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:00.711
which is the power

00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:04.701
of Mahalakshmi, the essence of Mahalakshmi,

00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:05.951
how She helps you.

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:21.931
Like situations we should accept

00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:30.741
Say, this morning, it was Amavasya,

00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:34.751
it's the day when if you worship

00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:39.791
Shri Ganesha, it's very deep.So, I wanted to have

00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:44.201
from the end of Amavasya to start the puja.

00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:01.511
Now, that's why the water finished;

00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:02.721
it would not start

00:11:03.366 --> 00:11:04.706
I could not take my bath.

00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:19.346
Because I have said- if I had said that we'll have puja at lunch time, many would have felt, "Oh God, now no lunch".

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:35.971
But that was the right time to start the puja,

00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:37.171
so there was no water

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:39.966
and I had to wait for the water.

00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:50.626
And a simple thing like that happened

00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:53.586
but it achieved

00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:56.731
the right time.

00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:11.581
Now when you start

00:12:11.581 --> 00:12:13.661
accepting situations,

00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:18.261
then you realize that all the situations

00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:19.571
are created

00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:24.911
not by anything else but Ritambara Pragnya Herself.

00:12:42.031 --> 00:12:46.201
But ego is such a thing, that it wants to do the way it likes.

00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:03.901
So people start doing things against the plans of the Divine.

00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:12.591
And all the time they are in friction

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:15.226
and in trouble, going against.

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:28.006
And thus, they have to take a double speed to fight.

00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:37.991
But going against the Divine, we are going against our ascent.

00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:47.611
These egos develop as a result

00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:50.731
of our upbringing, atmosphere

00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:54.191
and as a natural idea to assert.

00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:00.401
These as our conditioning and our upbringing

00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:05.321
and also as a natural idea we have to assert others.

00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:31.266
Natural idea

00:14:38.626 --> 00:14:41.146
No assertion, assertion means pressing others,

00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:44.031
dominating others.

00:14:46.491 --> 00:14:49.461
Now this domination part come to us

00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:53.021
from the matter because the matter dominates the Spirit.

00:15:03.211 --> 00:15:06.121
It dominates us through giving us comfort,

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.741
false notions, false ideas.

00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:19.711
It dominates through our desires

00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:25.651
It dominates through lust and greed.

00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:36.151
Also it dominates us

00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:38.421
through a very

00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:40.171
subtle way

00:15:40.561 --> 00:15:43.601
by possessing us through bhoots as we call them.

00:15:57.541 --> 00:15:59.291
And this is what

00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:00.691
we see how

00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:02.941
Shri Ganesha ascended

00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:08.271
as Christ to show us how we have to ascend

00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:11.561
out of all this mire of matter.

00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:33.761
As He is ascending we catch hold of this feet and we also ascend with Him.

00:16:42.691 --> 00:16:45.151
Though He is a child, He is very powerful

00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:47.941
and he can take us to that level

00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:50.991
where the Spirit resides.

00:17:00.031 --> 00:17:03.321
Now the first thing that we have to know is about sex.

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:14.591
In the west, sex has become an obsession with people

00:17:17.486 --> 00:17:20.206
as if it's a religion.

00:17:22.686 --> 00:17:26.806
And if they cannot be sexually active

00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:30.601
or if they are not having any sex activities,

00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:32.731
they think they are all wasted.

00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:36.471
They are good for nothing.

00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:48.221
The whole atmosphere is built up like that through your medias, through your televisions

00:17:48.221 --> 00:17:51.051
All kinds of things are put in to your head to feel

00:17:51.051 --> 00:17:53.766
that your inferior if you are not dealing with sex.

00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:16.311
And when we get attached to

00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:22.771
this kind of a stupid idea that our life is only meant for sex enjoyment,

00:18:23.906 --> 00:18:28.006
we start descending downward instead of descending upward.

00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:38.366
What is that? Lizard

00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.371
I don't like them very much

00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:43.431
Alright, doesn't matter

00:18:44.171 --> 00:18:46.871
It's a very different type of a lizard than an Indian

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:48.471
Better looking

00:18:50.291 --> 00:18:51.291
Yogi : Smaller

00:18:56.081 --> 00:18:57.121
Ah, she's green.

00:18:58.646 --> 00:19:02.546
You don't get green. Alright so

00:19:13.966 --> 00:19:15.806
So, to descend down

00:19:16.511 --> 00:19:18.061
is very easy,

00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:20.681
to fall is the easiest.

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.431
And when

00:19:22.941 --> 00:19:25.931
the idea of sex all the time hover our mind,

00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:29.361
our attention gets so much filled with it,

00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:31.931
that even with our eyes, with our thoughts,

00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:35.571
with our mind, our head, everything it is nothing but

00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:38.426
just this filth in our head.

00:20:03.346 --> 00:20:05.566
So, for the young people, when they get married

00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:10.321
the best thing is, they should realize the importance of sex

00:20:10.791 --> 00:20:13.941
is not so great.

00:20:27.281 --> 00:20:28.711
And they should start

00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:32.141
understanding that it is not a sin

00:20:32.141 --> 00:20:33.901
but it is not also everything.

00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:43.981
Then also women must know that

00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:47.071
they are on this earth to give

00:20:47.781 --> 00:20:51.051
place for the Realized souls to be born.

00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:03.781
And in the name of Ganesha, they should have innocent children.

00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:13.611
But when these Realized sould are born in the west, they do not keep their pure form

00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:16.541
because the parents are in a funny shape.

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:31.761
And though the Ganesha has done all the best

00:21:31.761 --> 00:21:35.031
that is possible to get the best children

00:21:35.221 --> 00:21:37.971
in the womb of the Realized mothers,

00:21:38.361 --> 00:21:41.611
they get really absolutely affected.

00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:59.601
And we start hurting them by our

00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:02.901
ill behaviour, by our wrong ideas.

00:22:13.581 --> 00:22:19.111
So when you are pregnant, one should read Ganesha's stotram,

00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:22.041
must do puja of Ganesha and try to remain pure

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:23.901
as far as sex is concerned.

00:22:38.641 --> 00:22:41.091
Moreover, we start thinking about

00:22:41.091 --> 00:22:42.866
something that is so spontaneous.

00:22:52.326 --> 00:22:55.681
What is there to think about it? Just an Indian won't understand this

00:22:55.681 --> 00:23:00.151
they won't understand in the village what is there to think about sex, it's so spontaneous.

00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:02.206
It's like thinking about going to the bathroom.

00:23:17.586 --> 00:23:23.226
It's a joyless pursuit and imaginary ideas

00:23:31.111 --> 00:23:34.141
So one has to be very very alert,

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:37.071
that we are now saints, we are Yogis

00:23:37.071 --> 00:23:40.171
and we are not going to waste our energy

00:23:40.171 --> 00:23:41.431
in this kind of a joyless pursuit.

00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:56.171
What is it there?

00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:02.001
What's it?

00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:04.101
It's a beetle, Ah

00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:07.371
can't be afraid of beetles.

00:24:10.566 --> 00:24:12.206
Alright, now

00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:19.226
when we understand our life as so important,

00:24:19.566 --> 00:24:21.726
for the imancipation of humanity,

00:24:22.811 --> 00:24:25.031
for giving light to others,

00:24:25.891 --> 00:24:31.251
for saving the whole world from the disaster, it is awaiting

00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:33.131
and we realize that.

00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:50.361
How can we waste?

00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:56.061
How can we waste our energy, our attention into such a

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:57.361
spontaneous thing like that?

00:25:06.911 --> 00:25:09.151
Specially for old people

00:25:10.121 --> 00:25:13.001
there is no need to think about it anymore, forget it,

00:25:13.001 --> 00:25:15.171
you are very happy that you are alright there.

00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:19.061
Now, just devote your time to something great.

00:25:30.961 --> 00:25:33.101
Actually, I miss nothing, whatsoever.

00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:42.071
The spiritual joy

00:25:42.391 --> 00:25:44.401
is so much greater

00:25:44.711 --> 00:25:47.971
and it's so eternal that we should not seek all this.

00:25:47.971 --> 00:25:52.011
On the contrary, whenever such thoughts come in we should sublimate it.

00:26:08.831 --> 00:26:12.291
You will see once you start doing that, your

00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:15.191
your sensitivity, your perception

00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:18.546
joy will be thousand fold.

00:26:32.566 --> 00:26:33.146
And gradually

00:26:33.151 --> 00:26:34.801
you will get over it

00:26:41.201 --> 00:26:42.891
because it is such a

00:26:44.681 --> 00:26:46.221
temporary pleasure,

00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:48.811
that's why people run after it.

00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:51.651
If it was something of eternal nature, one would not

00:26:51.761 --> 00:26:52.761
again go to it.

00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:08.501
But it is in human nature, it is natural, so

00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:14.471
it is being sanctified and one can have it till you are young.

00:27:14.471 --> 00:27:17.901
But then gradually, you must make your pure

00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:21.431
existence so purified

00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:23.981
that they should not enter into your mind at all.

00:27:44.861 --> 00:27:51.691
So when you catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesha, which are very tiny sweet little things,

00:27:52.181 --> 00:27:54.901
you should know that you should be yourself little lightweight,

00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:58.831
otherwise, if you are having all these problems upon yourself,

00:27:59.301 --> 00:28:01.811
He wouldn't like and He might just  again

00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:02.931
throw you down.

00:28:18.306 --> 00:28:23.641
And that your attention should be purified by attention towards Shri Ganesh

00:28:32.001 --> 00:28:34.801
Only people who are

00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:37.571
this kind really also enjoy sex,

00:28:37.571 --> 00:28:40.561
otherwise they cannot because they have so many perversions in their heads,

00:28:40.566 --> 00:28:42.906
I don't know what are they upto.

00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:58.026
And that is why

00:28:58.271 --> 00:28:59.541
they rise above,

00:29:00.591 --> 00:29:04.441
that is why they get fed up with it

00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:05.711
after sometime.

00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:20.791
And they mature properly in their own age, otherwise you will find even

00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:22.201
eighty years old people

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:25.881
shaking their hand on their sticks you see,

00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:28.471
still looking at young girls,

00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:29.661
it's something I cannot understand.

00:29:44.091 --> 00:29:45.971
And they look so stupid,

00:29:46.741 --> 00:29:48.351
they look so stupid.

00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:49.866
Everybody laughs at them.

00:29:54.906 --> 00:29:56.906
And young people make fun of them.

00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:03.101
But they feel as if they have become

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:05.961
something like a hero or

00:30:05.961 --> 00:30:08.111
in that old age suddenly.

00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:17.851
Like they showed once a

00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:20.181
film

00:30:20.871 --> 00:30:24.331
of all the very, very old eighty, eighty above,

00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:28.181
actors and actresses coming to do shake dance

00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:31.221
in a party. To do shake dance

00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:33.906
in a party.

00:30:43.921 --> 00:30:46.351
And from the limousine, they got down

00:30:46.351 --> 00:30:47.911
since then they were shaking.

00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:59.711
And when they came and tried to show they were very much in love and all that, looking

00:30:59.711 --> 00:31:04.371
so stupid that those who watched them were laughing and were rolling with laughter.

00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:21.871
It is so ridiculously clownish,

00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:25.301
but they said we are honest.

00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:42.081
So even if you do these things

00:31:42.526 --> 00:31:48.406
openly or with secrecy or whichever way you do it, it's stupid.

00:31:57.246 --> 00:31:58.506
And that is how,

00:31:59.011 --> 00:32:02.271
when you are not matured of your age

00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:06.031
you are not respected by your children,respected by

00:32:06.031 --> 00:32:10.321
anybody who is younger. He thinks you are stupid because you are not matured enough.

00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:24.161
Now when the fruits are

00:32:24.631 --> 00:32:26.321
in the flower form,

00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:31.051
that time all the fertilization takes place.

00:32:32.101 --> 00:32:35.321
Then at the fruit time they grow as fruits and not as flowers anymore.

00:32:48.821 --> 00:32:51.641
Flowers become fruits

00:32:53.361 --> 00:32:56.321
At the time of flower stage, there is fertilization,

00:32:56.321 --> 00:32:59.731
but not at the time of fruit, you see. Fruit trys to grow

00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:03.226
Fertilization is where they

00:33:29.846 --> 00:33:30.626
So this is what,

00:33:30.631 --> 00:33:33.601
that maturity is very important

00:33:33.606 --> 00:33:38.386
to reach, that is only possible if you really catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesh.

00:33:51.386 --> 00:33:55.351
So you remain innocent even in your old age.

00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:04.871
With all this understanding,

00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:08.371
Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

00:34:09.191 --> 00:34:10.791
by which we mature.

00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:18.361
So that thing is there

00:34:19.111 --> 00:34:20.611
in the room, I think I have got that thing

00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:23.361
decoration.

00:34:25.631 --> 00:34:26.731
Now the people

00:34:28.111 --> 00:34:31.051
who are indulging into lust

00:34:31.711 --> 00:34:32.731
have to

00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:37.371
see that they mature in their understanding.

00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:50.921
Then the people who are too much possessive

00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:56.981
of their things, of their possessions, of their

00:34:57.866 --> 00:35:07.666
children must also understand that Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

00:35:08.086 --> 00:35:09.126
to understand,

00:35:10.151 --> 00:35:12.681
that this is not yours.

00:35:33.366 --> 00:35:38.646
So what is carbon is nothing but a burnt wood, that is

00:35:38.786 --> 00:35:40.506
everything is burnt away.

00:35:52.026 --> 00:35:53.226
The wisdom that you get

00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:59.741
is that everything that you see as your own is not yours.

00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:06.401
Everything you have to leave here and go away. You can't take even this paper with you.

00:36:22.091 --> 00:36:24.381
So why are we attached to them,

00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:30.651
let us use it for its own purpose for expressing our joy.

00:36:40.401 --> 00:36:42.391
Now, I'll give you a very

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:45.271
beautiful example.

00:36:48.851 --> 00:36:52.071
See now how Ritambara Pragnya works.

00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.991
See, this necklace that you see

00:36:58.991 --> 00:37:00.806
was made in Italy

00:37:07.326 --> 00:37:09.186
by some realized soul.

00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:12.981
Then,

00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:15.361
this necklace,

00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:19.411
I don't know how it went to India.

00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:27.011
Now,

00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:30.871
the Australians wanted to give me

00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:32.171
a

00:37:32.561 --> 00:37:33.921
Mangal sutra of

00:37:34.451 --> 00:37:36.541
diamond like this, the other one I have.

00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:47.541
And they had collected ten thousand rupees,

00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:50.861
but even half of this size we could not buy

00:37:50.861 --> 00:37:53.991
because there was only one shop open on a sunday.

00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:55.621
situation

00:38:07.761 --> 00:38:10.761
So I looked around and I found

00:38:10.761 --> 00:38:13.791
a very nice gold Mangal sutra

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:18.721
made out of coral because Australia is Ganesha's land.

00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:38.491
I felt tremendous vibrations around,

00:38:38.491 --> 00:38:40.221
so I went on the back

00:38:41.751 --> 00:38:44.691
because they said, "it is very cheap". So, I said, " alright"

00:38:44.891 --> 00:38:47.221
And there this was placed

00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:49.331
and these earrings there.

00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:51.741
So, we bought all these,

00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:54.811
plus the Mangal sutra,

00:38:54.811 --> 00:38:57.781
plus one more piece which I have in coral

00:38:57.781 --> 00:38:58.781
in the same amount.

00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:23.731
It's not yet finished,

00:39:23.821 --> 00:39:26.391
then it was misplaced

00:39:26.811 --> 00:39:29.231
in Australia,it went into my box

00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:32.101
which was to come to London.

00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:47.666
So, I couldn't bring it to London

00:39:55.306 --> 00:39:56.946
Now, Thelma came

00:39:57.801 --> 00:39:59.251
from Australia

00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:01.881
and she brought it with her

00:40:01.881 --> 00:40:04.911
and it is now in Italy

00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:05.911
by the artist

00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:09.111
whose spirit could be seeing this

00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:12.651
to gratify him, not only that,

00:40:12.651 --> 00:40:16.111
but also that it is the day of Shri Ganesh

00:40:16.306 --> 00:40:17.686
from Australia.

00:40:41.626 --> 00:40:43.266
Yes, from Australia,

00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:46.261
this is sent as your brothers,

00:40:46.261 --> 00:40:49.381
the thing they bought made in Italy,

00:40:49.386 --> 00:40:52.906
on the day of Shri Ganesh. Can you have more combinations?

00:41:21.986 --> 00:41:23.326
Your brothers and sisters

00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:26.301
from Ganesha's place, you see, the Ganas

00:41:26.761 --> 00:41:28.421
have sent it to

00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:29.931
Devas here

00:41:30.801 --> 00:41:33.941
for the celebration, you are the Devas and they are the Ganas.

00:41:51.941 --> 00:41:52.941
And these are ten,

00:41:54.641 --> 00:41:57.051
ten, eleven and twelve.

00:41:57.621 --> 00:42:00.341
So this represents the heart,

00:42:02.591 --> 00:42:04.821
the dharma, ten

00:42:05.191 --> 00:42:06.191
and all

00:42:06.246 --> 00:42:08.506
put together is the heart.

00:42:13.846 --> 00:42:16.106
The whole of Europe

00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:28.131
and in addition to these two is the twelve, it's the heart : England.

00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:39.291
All are represented here

00:42:43.291 --> 00:42:46.281
Now you should be able to read through

00:42:46.961 --> 00:42:49.971
the beautiful working of

00:42:49.971 --> 00:42:52.131
Ritambara Pragnya which is very subtle.

00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:55.151
And then you'll start enjoying the little, little things

00:42:55.151 --> 00:42:58.001
it plays to make you very happy

00:42:58.331 --> 00:43:02.491
and to give you what some artist must have done it long time back,

00:43:03.591 --> 00:43:05.411
which his desire was

00:43:05.801 --> 00:43:06.801
to fulfill.

00:43:31.721 --> 00:43:34.631
No, this is also we should say,

00:43:34.631 --> 00:43:36.086
is the work of Shri Ganesha.

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:47.526
He resides as Omkara in the Ritambara Pragnya.

00:43:52.666 --> 00:43:58.931
He resides on the electromagnetic forces as the vibrations in the matter,

00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:06.691
in every atom.

00:44:10.846 --> 00:44:16.826
He resides in every ripple of our emotions which gives us joy.

00:44:31.606 --> 00:44:34.766
And he resides

00:44:36.051 --> 00:44:39.211
as a beautiful decoration of the Kundalini because

00:44:39.211 --> 00:44:42.131
she has the red and gold colour just like my sari.

00:44:53.426 --> 00:44:55.706
So, as the colour of Kundalini he resides.

00:45:00.366 --> 00:45:01.446
But at Sahastrara,

00:45:03.071 --> 00:45:05.601
he becomes the joy.

00:45:10.691 --> 00:45:13.671
At Muladhara as the fragrance,

00:45:18.481 --> 00:45:21.421
and every memory of mine

00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:24.811
should give you fragrance because he is the Lord of memory.

00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:37.041
So, this is how he manages everything

00:45:37.041 --> 00:45:38.511
so beautifully.

00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:46.431
He is such a innocent

00:45:48.731 --> 00:45:51.171
person who plays around

00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:52.411
his beauty

00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:54.086
to make us happy.

00:46:05.406 --> 00:46:07.221
Our children should also make us very happy

00:46:07.226 --> 00:46:09.606
if we have brought them up properly.

00:46:16.966 --> 00:46:18.486
But if we have been

00:46:18.491 --> 00:46:21.181
all the time busy with lust and greed,

00:46:21.546 --> 00:46:23.346
the children cannot be good children.

00:46:35.586 --> 00:46:36.706
They cannot represent

00:46:37.011 --> 00:46:39.161
Ganesha tatwa as it should be.

00:46:47.431 --> 00:46:49.741
So, today is a great day

00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:52.581
that we are establishing Shri Ganesha

00:46:52.581 --> 00:46:53.851
in Italy.

00:47:03.261 --> 00:47:05.511
We did this in Switzerland

00:47:06.246 --> 00:47:07.246
and now in Italy.

00:47:12.546 --> 00:47:14.246
This should give you

00:47:14.411 --> 00:47:15.821
the power of innocence,

00:47:16.271 --> 00:47:19.231
the power of purity,

00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:20.231
the power of wisdom.

00:47:30.561 --> 00:47:33.711
It should give you the art of playfulness of joy.

00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:53.051
And that special quality of turning everything into something

00:47:53.241 --> 00:47:54.241
fragrant.

00:48:01.981 --> 00:48:03.911
May God bless you all.
