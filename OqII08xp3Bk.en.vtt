00:01.360 --> 00:08.029
Today, I met a gentleman who told me – who
is an Indian, that as far as Indians are concerned

00:08.029 --> 00:09.290
they have come here to make money.

00:09.290 --> 00:10.290
Not to know God.

00:10.290 --> 00:18.160
So they are not interested in you.  And the
other people here, they won’t listen to

00:18.160 --> 00:19.160
you.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.460
They will come to your program and go away.

00:22.460 --> 00:23.760
I said- why?

00:23.760 --> 00:30.120
Because you can’t pin them down without
you get some money out of them.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.040
(Shri Mataji laughs in astonishment).

00:33.040 --> 00:36.410
I said, “how much are they going to pay
me?” He said, “Whatever you like” You

00:36.410 --> 00:37.910
must understand their psychology.

00:37.910 --> 00:40.950
If you do not take any money from them, they
won’t be bothered.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.579
You see, he told me an American psychology
which was really very shocking.

00:42.579 --> 00:47.020
He said, they talk like this- “I have paid
for this."

00:47.020 --> 00:51.320
If they have paid for it, they will go though
it whatever it is.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.510
Otherwise they will not go through it.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.910
And it was too much for me.

00:56.910 --> 00:59.110
I said- “I can’t believe it."

00:59.110 --> 01:00.300
How can that be?

01:00.300 --> 01:02.210
There are true seekers in this world.

01:02.210 --> 01:09.299
Those who are truthful seekers will understand
that you can not pay for what you have already

01:09.299 --> 01:10.850
within yourself.

01:10.850 --> 01:19.159
And this is what one has to realize that God
has built you up in such a fashion that everything

01:19.159 --> 01:20.440
is within you.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.870
You have got your spirit in your heart.

01:23.870 --> 01:30.500
As I told you before and then you have got
that vital force within you * or that divine

01:30.500 --> 01:32.320
force within you called as Kundalini.

01:32.320 --> 01:39.160
The true desire * This is the true desire.

01:39.160 --> 01:44.930
The rest of them as I told you are not true
desires as they do not give you satisfaction.

01:44.930 --> 01:50.640
So this is the true desire within you which
has to work it out and when it works out,

01:50.640 --> 01:52.790
you become yourself.

01:52.790 --> 01:58.300
Means you know what powers you have, and you
can manifest your own power.

01:58.300 --> 02:03.310
It seems very fantastic to hear that we have
all these powers within us that we can cure

02:03.310 --> 02:05.799
ourselves, we can cure others.

02:05.799 --> 02:13.330
We can cure our mental problems and we can
cure others’ mental problems.

02:13.330 --> 02:20.340
We can solve many problems of money and other
nonsensical things about which we are worried.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.440
Our priorities change.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.940
We become transformed and we become collectively
conscious.

02:24.940 --> 02:30.180
So we can treat others and we can know about
ourselves.

02:30.180 --> 02:36.530
Seems to be very fantastic but as I told you
that you are made into this beautiful body

02:36.530 --> 02:41.840
with great care and love in such a beautiful
way.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.650
I’ll show you that.

02:43.650 --> 02:46.819
Now all these centers exist within you.

02:46.819 --> 02:50.590
You need not take me for granted but they
exist.

02:50.590 --> 02:55.730
And when the kundalini rises, she passes through
all these various centers and enlightens them

02:55.730 --> 02:56.730
and nourishes them.

02:56.730 --> 03:04.220
It’s a fact that this knowledge was known
to Indians, great seers of Indians, thousands

03:04.220 --> 03:05.709
of years back.

03:05.709 --> 03:09.030
But we had three types of practices in India.

03:09.030 --> 03:14.599
The first one was where people were in devotion
to God.

03:14.599 --> 03:20.100
They wanted help from God and they thought
that by praying to God, by (meditating*Unclear)

03:20.100 --> 03:24.540
themselves to God they will be able to achieve
the advent of God.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.590
So they were praying for the advent of God,
that was one sided.

03:27.590 --> 03:30.310
Left sided people as we can call it.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.310
Who worship.

03:31.310 --> 03:37.110
The right sided people are the people who
thought that it is better to excite and awaken

03:37.110 --> 03:45.840
the different elements by which we can be
benefited.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.790
And that’s how they tried to do “yagnas”(hawan).

03:48.790 --> 03:56.140
“yagnas” means a kind of a ritual by which
you can excite or by which you can use the

03:56.140 --> 03:57.180
power of the elements.

03:57.180 --> 04:04.069
And that’s how they did lot of rituals by
which they tried to overpower and they had

04:04.069 --> 04:15.170
(unclear*) quite a lot of development long
time back about…They say that in India we

04:15.170 --> 04:20.749
had aeroplanes, pilot lessons aeroplanes where
it was about eight thousand years back.

04:20.749 --> 04:26.240
So, whether you believe it or not but they
tried to do it through this method of exciting

04:26.240 --> 04:37.529
or knowing the subtle side of the elements
and how to use it for their own purposes.

04:37.529 --> 04:44.610
And the third side (Unclear*) was where people
tried to find out, Sorry! …(Unclear*) they

04:44.610 --> 04:48.030
tried to find out why we are here?

04:48.030 --> 04:50.569
Why God has created us?

04:50.569 --> 04:51.969
What does he want us to do?

04:51.969 --> 04:55.349
Why should we live on this world like this?

04:55.349 --> 04:57.990
Because they realized that this is not the
ultimate.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.229
We have not found absolute.

05:00.229 --> 05:01.680
And such people meditated.

05:01.680 --> 05:07.080
Through their meditative approach they reached
certain heights.

05:07.080 --> 05:12.779
They found out certain secrets about ourselves
and they described all these chakras that

05:12.779 --> 05:14.759
I am describing to you fourteen thousand years
back.

05:14.759 --> 05:16.180
It’s nothing new , the tact(*Unclear).

05:16.180 --> 05:26.580
Only thing, I am giving it a modern connection!
That all these subtle centers are within us

05:26.580 --> 05:28.580
and they manifest outside   .

05:28.580 --> 05:35.160
All the known plexuses and ductless gland.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.860
For example the (*Unclear) the Nabhi Chakra.

05:39.860 --> 05:42.060
This one manifests the (*Edited.

05:42.060 --> 05:47.330
Part of the speech missing) We have the pelvic
plexus and then we have the aortic plexus,

05:47.330 --> 05:51.639
then solar plexus, then cardiac plexus and
here we have the cervical plexus.

05:51.639 --> 05:58.479
And here at optic chiasma, we have got a very
subtle center, which we call as agya chakra.

05:58.479 --> 06:02.949
Which controls the pituitary and the pineal
and is placed on the optic chiasma.

06:02.949 --> 06:04.050
In the cross of that.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.839
So this is the center.

06:05.839 --> 06:14.410
And the limbic area which doctors know about,
is the one which is enclosed by the ego and

06:14.410 --> 06:16.099
super ego of human beings.

06:16.099 --> 06:18.009
That’s how we have all the picture.

06:18.009 --> 06:19.860
This is the tree of life.

06:19.860 --> 06:23.849
Now, the tree of life is ready, only thing-
it is to be nourished.

06:23.849 --> 06:27.550
And for that nourishment, that kundalini is
placed there.

06:27.550 --> 06:28.899
I am sorry, you can’t see?

06:28.899 --> 06:31.059
(Shri Mataji makes a physical move to the
side).

06:31.059 --> 06:37.529
And this kundalini is nothing else but is
the Aquarius within you.

06:37.529 --> 06:41.659
That’s why it is called as the age of the
Aquarius.

06:41.659 --> 06:45.559
Many people don’t know, why is it called
as the age of the Aquarius?

06:45.559 --> 06:51.050
Aquarius means the water carrier and this
is the one that is the water carrier within

06:51.050 --> 06:52.050
us.

06:52.050 --> 06:58.599
The sacrum, the sacred bone in which this
power is there and this power is your Mother.

06:58.599 --> 07:04.051
And when she nourishes you, you solve all
these problems that I told you.

07:04.051 --> 07:10.190
You solve your spiritual problem and ultimately
you become one with your spirit.

07:10.190 --> 07:15.449
It is a very simple thing because nature does
everything in a very simple way.

07:15.449 --> 07:19.959
As I told you yesterday, if you have to sprout
a seed- you just put it in the mother earth.

07:19.959 --> 07:21.849
What do you do?

07:21.849 --> 07:22.849
Nothing else.

07:22.849 --> 07:23.979
Mother earth has got the capacity.

07:23.979 --> 07:27.849
In the same way, when this has to rise, it
has to rise spontaneously.

07:27.849 --> 07:39.369
Now the idea, you must clean yourself, you
must do this and that…is not necessary.

07:39.369 --> 07:43.309
Say when you are sitting in your car, you
have to get out of it to correct it.

07:43.309 --> 07:50.709
So first, get out of it, not only that but
you get the light to see what’s wrong with

07:50.709 --> 07:51.709
you.

07:51.709 --> 07:56.520
In that light, you understand what’s wrong
with you, you correct yourself so Nobody has

07:56.520 --> 07:57.520
to tell you.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.649
You correct yourself.

07:58.649 --> 08:01.179
And by correcting yourself, what do you get?

08:01.179 --> 08:07.610
You get an absolute being within yourself
which is the spirit.

08:07.610 --> 08:11.649
So now, the time has come for you to get integration.

08:11.649 --> 08:18.339
The complete synthesis of all the religions
has to come to (*UNCLEAR) but its not a mental

08:18.339 --> 08:19.800
projection, again I would say.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.729
It’s not a mental projection, I should say
that all the religions are one.

08:23.729 --> 08:25.460
Nobody is going to understand that.

08:25.460 --> 08:26.460
It’s nonsense.

08:26.460 --> 08:31.319
Because people say, how if all religions are
the same, why are they fighting with each

08:31.319 --> 08:32.319
other?

08:32.319 --> 08:34.550
They are having wars, they had wars, they
are having wars, they’ll have wars.

08:34.550 --> 08:40.209
So how is it possible that all these religions
are coming from one tree.

08:40.209 --> 08:42.610
They are flowers of one tree.

08:42.610 --> 08:44.240
How can that be?

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
That has to be seen.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.269
If it is so or not?

08:47.269 --> 08:55.740
When it happens, you automatically realize
that all of them belong to the same tree of

08:55.740 --> 08:56.740
life.

08:56.740 --> 09:01.060
And these different destinations that you
see are not actually the destination but are

09:01.060 --> 09:05.779
the milestones in our life time by which we
rise.

09:05.779 --> 09:09.750
Now many people have a habit that they stuck
on to one chakra.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.449
For example, those who are hindus, will just
believe in “Krishna” and nobody else.

09:13.449 --> 09:15.720
Krishna is just here (Shri Mataji pointing
towards the Vishudhi Chakra on her neck) he

09:15.720 --> 09:17.480
came six thousand years back.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
He is here.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.740
Then some will believe only in Rama.

09:19.740 --> 09:20.740
Rama is just here.

09:20.740 --> 09:22.180
(Shree Mataji pointing towards her heart chakra
to show Shri Rama’s place).

09:22.180 --> 09:26.140
Or some will believe only in Christ, Christ
is here (Shree Mataji pointing on her forehead,

09:26.140 --> 09:27.410
where her Kumkum is) Now Christ is just here.

09:27.410 --> 09:29.100
He is the Gate, Alright! But he is not the
destination.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.480
So what is the destination?

09:30.480 --> 09:31.500
Is the Limbic Area.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.670
You have to enter into the kingdom of God,
he said it.

09:35.670 --> 09:36.670
He always talked of the future.

09:36.670 --> 09:41.300
He said you have to enter into the kingdom
of God, Holy Ghost has to come.

09:41.300 --> 09:49.870
He said that you are to get somebody who will
counsel you, you will redeem you, who will

09:49.870 --> 09:51.120
comfort you.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.170
And that is the Holy Ghost.

09:52.170 --> 09:57.561
Off Couse he did not say that it’s a lady,
because he thought that if I say it’s a

09:57.561 --> 10:01.519
Mother, they will be all towards his Mother,
attack her.

10:01.519 --> 10:03.000
And he didn’t want to do that.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.290
To loose all the drama of crucifixion.

10:05.290 --> 10:10.310
So he didn’t say that it was my mother who
is one of the powers of God but he just kept

10:10.310 --> 10:13.329
quiet about it.

10:13.329 --> 10:19.529
But you…As I said this afternoon that it
is impossible to understand how people rationalize

10:19.529 --> 10:23.360
that there is a Holy Ghost, there is a Father
and there is a Son.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.639
And No Mother.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.439
It’s an impossible.

10:26.439 --> 10:32.120
And you can understand it clearly that there
has to be a Mother, who has to come up and

10:32.120 --> 10:33.120
nourish.

10:33.120 --> 10:39.209
Now you, (*Editted/skipped portion) who opposed
Freud said it very clearly that it is the

10:39.209 --> 10:42.250
Mother who is going to nourish us.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.170
He even took the name of Kundalini.

10:44.170 --> 10:45.680
He studied upto that point.

10:45.680 --> 10:52.160
But the mistake was when he tried to talk
about it, his knowledge was that of a person

10:52.160 --> 10:53.930
who jumped on the stage.

10:53.930 --> 10:56.750
Suddenly! And he is trying to know over the
stage.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.720
So it can be mistaken also.

10:59.720 --> 11:05.290
And he got quite confused because he said
that to get to the unconscious you have to

11:05.290 --> 11:06.290
pass the subconscious.

11:06.290 --> 11:11.180
And the other day I explained to you that
there are four areas of unconscious.

11:11.180 --> 11:14.250
Means from four areas we do not get any messages.

11:14.250 --> 11:18.250
We are unconscious of it because we don’t
feel it on the central nervous system.

11:18.250 --> 11:23.140
Now these four areas I have told you before
and I’ll repeat them again.

11:23.140 --> 11:27.370
On the left hand side, as you see of the person.

11:27.370 --> 11:29.060
(Shri Mataji explaining on the chakra chart
various aspects) On this side means facing,

11:29.060 --> 11:31.060
we should see the left side where the hand
is like this.

11:31.060 --> 11:40.290
Is the blue line as you see is called as the
Ida Channel which gives the manifestation.

11:40.290 --> 11:44.680
In the gross of the left sympathetic nervous
system which looks after our emotions.

11:44.680 --> 11:50.800
And beyond that is the subconscious and the
collective subconscious.

11:50.800 --> 11:56.439
On the right hand side, when we think of the
future too much, plan for the future too much

11:56.439 --> 12:02.199
then we enter into the area called supra conscious
and collective supra conscious.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.540
Now down below as you see, there is hell.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.709
The collective hell.

12:05.709 --> 12:09.519
We live in hell and we have collective hell
also.

12:09.519 --> 12:12.769
Above, on top your head, is the super consciousness.

12:12.769 --> 12:13.990
Which is unconscious.

12:13.990 --> 12:19.170
Just now, you do not feel it on your central
nervous system so it is unconscious.

12:19.170 --> 12:24.699
To make it conscious what we have to do is
to, bring into your consciousness on to your

12:24.699 --> 12:29.420
central nervous system the existence of your
spirit.

12:29.420 --> 12:32.730
Once that comes in your consciousness.

12:32.730 --> 12:33.730
In your attention.

12:33.730 --> 12:36.029
Then you start feeling the all pervading power.

12:36.029 --> 12:39.629
The subtle power, which does all the living
thing.

12:39.629 --> 12:42.850
Like creating the flowers, like creating fruits
out of the flowers.

12:42.850 --> 12:46.600
Every sort of a living work is done by that
all pervading power.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.910
Now for that, what can you pay?

12:50.910 --> 12:52.010
What can you pay?

12:52.010 --> 12:53.029
That’s one thing.

12:53.029 --> 12:56.290
One should understand that you can’t pay
for all this thing.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.339
This is your own.

12:57.339 --> 12:58.570
It is within you.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.649
I am paid for it already.

13:01.649 --> 13:02.850
You can think like that.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.029
And it is within you.

13:04.029 --> 13:05.029
The whole power is within you.

13:05.029 --> 13:06.600
You have to just get to it.

13:06.600 --> 13:11.630
Now, I do not want to criticize any religious
bodies as such but they are doing all the

13:11.630 --> 13:12.630
upside down things.

13:12.630 --> 13:13.790
You can see for yourself.

13:13.790 --> 13:17.170
You’ll be amazed in London, people are selling
the churches.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.089
And they are having their pubs.

13:19.089 --> 13:22.629
I mean after (*Editted/skipped portion) something
of the same kind.

13:22.629 --> 13:23.830
So what is the reason.

13:23.830 --> 13:25.190
Now, what is the reason?

13:25.190 --> 13:27.699
Not only that but in Indian temples same thing
happening.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.999
In mosques also same thing happening.

13:29.999 --> 13:33.399
In all the other religions the same thing
is happening.

13:33.399 --> 13:34.910
Jews are having the same problem.

13:34.910 --> 13:38.570
Unless and Until you are a fanatic, nobody
is bothered about you.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.790
But fanaticism is a disease.

13:40.790 --> 13:43.699
Because they believe in one center.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.089
One part of it.

13:45.089 --> 13:49.290
I’ll give you an example, I met a gentleman
who came from Iran about ten years back to

13:49.290 --> 13:50.579
see me.

13:50.579 --> 13:54.709
He was a doctor and he was suffering from
stomach problem.

13:54.709 --> 13:55.750
Stomach cancer.

13:55.750 --> 14:02.370
Somebody told him in India that I may be able
to help him so he came down.

14:02.370 --> 14:05.850
He came to London to see me.

14:05.850 --> 14:09.330
When he came to London, he asked me, “Mother,
can you cure me?’’.

14:09.330 --> 14:11.800
I said, “I can, but have a disease."

14:11.800 --> 14:13.040
He said, “What disease”?

14:13.040 --> 14:14.910
I said, “You are a fanatic."

14:14.910 --> 14:15.910
He said “No."

14:15.910 --> 14:19.420
I said, do you believe that only Mohammed
saa’b is the one for you?

14:19.420 --> 14:22.499
He said, yes off course; I do not believe
in anybody else.

14:22.499 --> 14:29.870
I believe..(Shree Mataji asked someone if
they are recording or not) Any problem?

14:29.870 --> 14:53.540
(As someone tries to fix the mic/wires, Shree
Mataji says I don’t understand these things…laughter.

14:53.540 --> 14:57.870
I don’t understand these connections.

14:57.870 --> 15:07.069
I am absolutely ignorant about these things.)

15:07.069 --> 15:11.939
So I told him, Let’s see now, if you believe
it’s only Mohammed Saa’b I can not cure

15:11.939 --> 15:12.939
you.

15:12.939 --> 15:14.790
Clear you of your problems.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.819
So he said, then what do you want me to say?

15:16.819 --> 15:21.110
I said, you have to say that Mohammed Saa’b
was one of the incarnations of the primordial

15:21.110 --> 15:25.940
masters and there are many others who came
on this earth.

15:25.940 --> 15:32.990
For example- Abraham, Moses, some people in
India like Raja Janaka, Nanaka, all of them

15:32.990 --> 15:34.800
were the incarnation of the same.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.820
He said “This I can not say."

15:36.820 --> 15:38.559
I said, “Alright then! Go Ahead.

15:38.559 --> 15:39.769
I can not cure you either."

15:39.769 --> 15:43.319
If you are obstinate about it you go ahead.

15:43.319 --> 15:47.160
If you believe in only one person, like Mohammed
Saa’b who is angry with you.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.300
Take it from me.

15:48.300 --> 15:51.160
Because he can not understand this kind of
a stupidity.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.410
He never did that.

15:52.410 --> 15:56.480
What he said was, all of them were prophets
and they have come on this earth and only

15:56.480 --> 16:02.459
he said that “I am the seal!” Seal does
not mean that I have sealed them.

16:02.459 --> 16:07.050
Means I am one of the samples of that.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.019
I am one of the symbols of that.

16:10.019 --> 16:11.220
And that’s what he said.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.800
And they said he is the seal now, nobody can
come.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.360
How can it be?

16:15.360 --> 16:19.610
When he himself has talked about resurrection
time, that when the resurrection time will

16:19.610 --> 16:21.360
come your hands will speak.

16:21.360 --> 16:26.690
And there is “Assess” he called the kundalini
as “Assess” and that resides in the triangular

16:26.690 --> 16:27.690
bone.

16:27.690 --> 16:31.639
All these things he says, he talks of the
resurrection day all these things he talk

16:31.639 --> 16:37.480
and how can you say that Mohammed Saa’b
didn’t talk of all these things.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.619
He did very well.

16:38.619 --> 16:40.540
But people don’t want to have that.

16:40.540 --> 16:42.200
They don’t want to listen to it.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.970
They don’t want to understand it because
they want to use it for their own purposes.

16:45.970 --> 16:51.749
When they want to use it for their own purposes
they have their own concept of Mohammed Saa’b,

16:51.749 --> 16:58.220
about Christ, about Krishna, about Rama, about
everyone they have their own concept.

16:58.220 --> 17:00.139
And they want to live with that concept.

17:00.139 --> 17:02.000
They do not want to get out of it.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.640
Because its beyond them.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.240
It is beyond them to get out of those concepts.

17:07.240 --> 17:11.130
Because they are bound by their ego.

17:11.130 --> 17:15.069
Ego, is one of the greatest myths we are carrying
with ourselves.

17:15.069 --> 17:17.260
And it make you absolutely stupid.

17:17.260 --> 17:19.720
Is the most stupid thing that is Ego.

17:19.720 --> 17:25.539
Ego is the thing which tells you that we do
this, we do that, we don’t do anything what

17:25.539 --> 17:27.320
so ever.  What do we do?

17:27.320 --> 17:29.120
Supposing, a tree is dead.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.390
You make it into a bench.

17:30.390 --> 17:33.010
Alright! Or a chair, or anything.

17:33.010 --> 17:37.340
Can you make a flower into a fruit?

17:37.340 --> 17:38.350
Even one?

17:38.350 --> 17:39.870
You can not.

17:39.870 --> 17:42.390
So what do you do?

17:42.390 --> 17:46.940
Its only stones, and dead wood you play with.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.580
What living work you have done?

17:48.580 --> 17:49.580
Nothing.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.750
Nothong! Then what do you do?

17:51.750 --> 17:56.799
Except for making a chair for yourself or
some sort of a comfort by which you become

17:56.799 --> 17:58.929
absolutely a lethargic person.

17:58.929 --> 18:01.409
If you make a chair, you can not sit on the
ground.

18:01.409 --> 18:03.899
If you make a bed, you can not sleep on the
ground.

18:03.899 --> 18:05.950
You become a slave of this matter.

18:05.950 --> 18:10.740
Graudually you start becoming a greater slave
and greater slave and ultimately you think,

18:10.740 --> 18:12.490
Oh..you are the lord of the matter.

18:12.490 --> 18:13.669
But the matter is ruling you.

18:13.669 --> 18:17.669
Suppose the electricity goes away, what will
happen to us?

18:17.669 --> 18:19.190
Supposing we don’t get any petrol.

18:19.190 --> 18:23.179
Suddenly, everybody will be (*UNCLEAR WORD)
one day, electricity went off in New York,

18:23.179 --> 18:24.230
then what happened?

18:24.230 --> 18:31.000
So much we are dependent on the matter now
and not our spirit.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.940
And that is the trouble with us that we have
to depend on our spirit and on that great

18:36.940 --> 18:38.860
power of God who has created us.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.870
Who is the one who has done all this living
work.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.010
And who is going to do greater living work.

18:44.010 --> 18:48.029
We have to depend on that greater force of
life.

18:48.029 --> 18:49.860
That higher force of life.

18:49.860 --> 18:56.250
And we have to say that, Oh Lord!, Please
give us that we deserve.

18:56.250 --> 19:00.809
And you will be amazed, how anxious he is
to give you that great thing.

19:00.809 --> 19:06.460
To give you that (*BENEDICTION) that is your
right to have it.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.750
Sahaja means that.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.960
Sahaja means it is born with you.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.179
It’s your birth right to get realized.

19:12.179 --> 19:14.090
It’s your (TIME;19:21) birth right.

19:14.090 --> 19:15.330
You have to have it.

19:15.330 --> 19:17.039
But how many want to be realized.

19:17.039 --> 19:23.740
They want to belong to some group they belong
to this group or that group.

19:23.740 --> 19:26.690
I don’t know what people get by clubbing
themselves like this.

19:26.690 --> 19:29.420
Which is artificial clubbing, you know.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.010
I have to go in England, all kinds of clubs.

19:32.010 --> 19:35.240
I am sometimes surprised, how they have clubs
about.

19:35.240 --> 19:40.150
Like the people who hold their forks in the
left hand and the knives on the right hand

19:40.150 --> 19:43.820
are one and those who hold the other way round
are another club.

19:43.820 --> 19:45.590
IT’s stupid.

19:45.590 --> 19:48.620
And such a wastage of time.

19:48.620 --> 19:55.030
They have conferences, meetings of a group....People
are coming all the way from Australia, from

19:55.030 --> 20:03.980
Japan, this that….and what do you come out
of there(*UNCLEAR) what is there to club?

20:03.980 --> 20:11.299
And this clubbing shows in every walk of life
that we try to club under the name of something

20:11.299 --> 20:14.330
nonsensical or something that is hatred.

20:14.330 --> 20:17.840
When we hate others, then we club together.

20:17.840 --> 20:21.961
Like we have to hate this type of people or
that type of people.

20:21.961 --> 20:26.090
This type of people are bad, that type of
people are bad, and we have to aggress these

20:26.090 --> 20:28.870
type of people or we have to protect ourselves
from these people.

20:28.870 --> 20:30.990
It’s all is hatred.

20:30.990 --> 20:32.399
A kind of a fear.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.399
All the time working.

20:33.399 --> 20:39.510
While God has created you all beautifully
to (*) off course there is variety.

20:39.510 --> 20:41.529
Variety has to be there.

20:41.529 --> 20:43.480
Without variety, you would look so horrid.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.779
I mean, imagine everybody looking just the
same.

20:45.779 --> 20:48.649
You would not know who is a lady or a gentleman?

20:48.649 --> 20:50.610
It happens these days, very common.

20:50.610 --> 20:55.799
My experience has been terrific this time
(Laughter) In programs, I call some gentleman

20:55.799 --> 20:59.020
as a lady and he gets angry and he says No,
Mother I am a man.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.370
I said, I am sorry, see, I couldn’t make
out.

21:01.370 --> 21:02.370
You see.

21:02.370 --> 21:03.370
The way you are walking.

21:03.370 --> 21:05.260
The way you are dressed I just thought that
you must be a lady.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.460
What can I do?

21:06.460 --> 21:07.830
(*Editted/skipped) just human beings.

21:07.830 --> 21:15.210
He has made us men and women and children
and everything to create the mood of variety.

21:15.210 --> 21:22.789
And that mood of variety that gives us a special
absolute as human beings.

21:22.789 --> 21:26.140
Animals do not have so much variety.

21:26.140 --> 21:28.630
Only the human beings have so much variety.

21:28.630 --> 21:32.860
And the craziness also that we have is our
specialty.

21:32.860 --> 21:36.279
Like animals will never create an atom bomb
to kill themselves.

21:36.279 --> 21:38.760
I mean, Thank God they can’t.

21:38.760 --> 21:45.240
But we human beings can do such absurd thing
as to make a bomb just to kill ourselves or

21:45.240 --> 21:47.900
to kill others who are our kith and kin.

21:47.900 --> 21:54.330
So this is what it is that we have now reached
a very precarious stage where everyone knows,

21:54.330 --> 21:56.990
God knows what is going to happen.

21:56.990 --> 22:02.399
Everybody is frightened and this time we have
to know that as soon as we are transformed

22:02.399 --> 22:06.320
we are looked after by that Divine power.

22:06.320 --> 22:15.409
Krishna has said, “Yoga-Kshema vyamaham”
when yoga takes place, I look after your well

22:15.409 --> 22:16.409
being.

22:16.409 --> 22:17.409
Kshema is well being.

22:17.409 --> 22:19.480
So first yoga has to take place.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.529
It is not before yoga.

22:21.529 --> 22:25.284
Many people think “Oh we believe in God,
Oh! We used to go to the Church, we used to

22:25.284 --> 22:30.640
go to the temple, we always would worship
Krishna, everything.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.860
And we never got any benefit.

22:33.860 --> 22:36.809
So one should ask- were you connected?

22:36.809 --> 22:38.850
If you are not connected with God.

22:38.850 --> 22:48.399
If you are not one with God how will you get
anything that is your due?

22:48.399 --> 22:50.450
So first thing is yoga.

22:50.450 --> 22:54.269
Is to become one with the Divine.

22:54.269 --> 22:57.260
Establish the connection and that’s the
most important thing.

22:57.260 --> 23:01.720
Many people ask me- what about “Hath Yoga?”
In Hatha Yoga there are “Ashtangas” there

23:01.720 --> 23:02.720
are eight folds.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.020
Out of which the main thing is “Ishwar-Pranidhan”.

23:06.020 --> 23:16.039
Ishwar Pranidhana is that you establish yourself
in such a way that God is establish within

23:16.039 --> 23:17.039
you.

23:17.039 --> 23:23.130
Means- First is self realization! Then you
know and it is logical.

23:23.130 --> 23:29.730
That once you know your kundalini has started
moving and you will know which center is catching

23:29.730 --> 23:35.179
and what kind of an exercise you have to do,
what kind of “Dharana” means meditation

23:35.179 --> 23:36.179
you have to do.

23:36.179 --> 23:39.940
What mantras you have to say and unless and
until the kundalini is moving how will you

23:39.940 --> 23:44.899
know which chakra it is catching?

23:44.899 --> 23:50.190
And that is why, it is essential that first
kundalini should be awakened.

23:50.190 --> 23:57.250
Once the kundalini is awakened you start feeling
her movement, you start feeling your chakras,

23:57.250 --> 24:00.250
you start understanding all the blocks you
have.

24:00.250 --> 24:03.529
You start understanding what problems others
have.

24:03.529 --> 24:08.700
If you know how to cure them, if you know
how to put them right you can make the kundalini

24:08.700 --> 24:14.470
rise straight and then once it comes out and
then you establish it.

24:14.470 --> 24:16.620
You have to establish it.

24:16.620 --> 24:25.480
Once its establish then only you will feel
that you are absolutely there.

24:25.480 --> 24:29.100
So the first power you get is of thoughtless
awareness.

24:29.100 --> 24:36.539
Which is called in Sanskrit as “Nirvichar-Samadhi”
It used to take ages in those days to establish

24:36.539 --> 24:37.539
even “Nirvichar Samadhi”.

24:37.539 --> 24:40.419
But I must be something the way I am doing
it so fast.

24:40.419 --> 24:42.000
It’s like a jet.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.100
The kundalini rises just like a jet.

24:44.100 --> 24:47.899
So there must be something about me but I
am not going to tell you anything about myself.

24:47.899 --> 24:51.850
It’s better that you know yourself first
and then you ask about me.

24:51.850 --> 24:56.440
It’s much safer for you and much safer for
you also.

24:56.440 --> 25:02.500
So when the kundalini rises, she comes up
through this center of Agya and when it crosses

25:02.500 --> 25:05.559
through that time we become thoughtlessly
aware.

25:05.559 --> 25:07.059
Then your attention is stationed.

25:07.059 --> 25:10.419
There is no thought in between.

25:10.419 --> 25:11.669
Like a thought rises and falls off.

25:11.669 --> 25:13.160
Another thought rises and falls off.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.770
(Shri Mataji uses her hand to express it as
a wave going up and coming down for thought

25:15.770 --> 25:16.770
process).

25:16.770 --> 25:19.240
You can see the rising of the thought but
falling you don’t see.

25:19.240 --> 25:23.559
In between these two thoughts there is a space
and that is the space which is the present.

25:23.559 --> 25:30.779
When the kundalini rises, what she does - she
makes this thought weak or elongated.  By

25:30.779 --> 25:35.450
that there is a space, that increases and
you stationed yourself in the present.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.059
You become thoughtlessly aware.

25:37.059 --> 25:39.230
Again, I say- you are aware.

25:39.230 --> 25:42.230
But you are thoughtless and you can watch
your thoughts.

25:42.230 --> 25:45.590
If you want to, you can create your thoughts
if you want to.

25:45.590 --> 25:49.130
That’s the first stage of kundalini awakening.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.460
But when she crosses up here (Shri Puts her
hand onto her Sahastrara) and she comes out

25:51.460 --> 25:58.000
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your
head then I should say that you have got your

25:58.000 --> 26:01.941
self -realization in the sense now, an egg
has become a bird.

26:01.941 --> 26:06.780
But still, there are many things of the egg
which are sticking on.

26:06.780 --> 26:11.970
AS every bird has to through away the shell
properly to come out or the Mother has to

26:11.970 --> 26:14.110
work hard to through it away.

26:14.110 --> 26:18.590
And once that is taken away then complete
cleansing has to take place till the bird

26:18.590 --> 26:19.899
is ready to fly.

26:19.899 --> 26:28.299
Then the bird is afraid still to fly and it
spreads its wings here and there but it doesn’t

26:28.299 --> 26:29.299
fly.

26:29.299 --> 26:33.559
So the Mother bird hides herself and calls
the little ones.

26:33.559 --> 26:39.799
After sometime, the birds spreads the wings,
goes up, flies upto a point.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.820
It thinks it is falling down, falls.

26:41.820 --> 26:48.460
Again it rises, again it falls ultimately
it achieves that state where it starts flying

26:48.460 --> 26:50.480
very well straight forward.

26:50.480 --> 26:56.610
When that is achieved, that state we call
as “Doubtless Awareness” called as “Nirvikalpa

26:56.610 --> 27:02.350
Samadhi” But in the olden times these were
divide into two -two.

27:02.350 --> 27:06.510
First was “Svichar Samadhi then second was
“Nirvichar Samadhi”.

27:06.510 --> 27:10.910
Means first the Samadhi means the enlightened
mind.

27:10.910 --> 27:16.139
So first the enlightened mind with the thoughts
in then the second one was the thoughtless

27:16.139 --> 27:17.500
enlightened mind.

27:17.500 --> 27:25.750
Third one was as it should be only “Nirvichar
Samadhi” but it was not so it should be

27:25.750 --> 27:31.230
“Nirvikalapa Samadhi” means doubtless
awareness they would have and enlightened

27:31.230 --> 27:34.889
mind still with doubts.

27:34.889 --> 27:41.179
And then the fourth one they used to say as
enlightened mind which has no doubts of any

27:41.179 --> 27:42.179
kinds.

27:42.179 --> 27:46.019
Which is beyond (*UNCLEAR) but with all these
four stages you get different powers within

27:46.019 --> 27:52.809
yourself by which you start manisfesting the
power of raising the kundalini also.

27:52.809 --> 28:00.679
Now, this is the thing one has to understand
that, some people move slowly.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.389
Some people move just like a jet.

28:04.389 --> 28:09.210
Some people move slowly and steadily and establish
themselves.

28:09.210 --> 28:13.090
Some people move like a jet and establish
themselves.

28:13.090 --> 28:15.960
Some people move like a jet can fall down.

28:15.960 --> 28:23.130
Some people move slowly and steadily and go
on falling up and down, up and down, up and

28:23.130 --> 28:24.130
down.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.200
The reason is you have many problems.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.809
Which you face after realization.

28:27.809 --> 28:30.740
One of them is your health.

28:30.740 --> 28:38.210
If you have physical problem that shows immediately
you start seeing the physical problem within

28:38.210 --> 28:39.210
yourself.

28:39.210 --> 28:49.460
You start curing yourself and once the physical
problem is handled then you want your emotional

28:49.460 --> 28:50.780
problems should be handeled.

28:50.780 --> 28:53.429
So you come to the emotional problem.

28:53.429 --> 28:55.899
You start solving your emotional problems.

28:55.899 --> 29:01.390
Then you go to the higher thing where your
intellectual problems where the doubts start

29:01.390 --> 29:02.809
coming in.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.909
and that is the intellectual problem you start
solving.

29:05.909 --> 29:08.320
Once you solve your intellectual problems
like this.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.720
Like we had (*UNCLEAR..

29:09.720 --> 29:12.190
Some name) first time he got his realization.

29:12.190 --> 29:16.100
He is an intellectual very well read man,
he knows all about it.

29:16.100 --> 29:19.450
Today that lady asked me about some (Edited
or skipped) which I never read.

29:19.450 --> 29:22.170
See I don’t read books, I don’t have time
to read book you see.

29:22.170 --> 29:23.240
I am reading human beings only.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.500
And she asked me for that book and I said
I don’t read that book and they told me

29:27.500 --> 29:29.160
its about doom’s day (UNCLEAR) stop.

29:29.160 --> 29:32.429
Because you have read all about it.

29:32.429 --> 29:34.970
I am talking about the resurrection days.

29:34.970 --> 29:42.460
So, now when he got his realization he said-
“Mother, you told us that you have got telecommunication

29:42.460 --> 29:45.490
and you can feel the other people.

29:45.490 --> 29:48.070
I haven’t had any information from my father.

29:48.070 --> 29:52.630
I want to know how he is?” I said, Alright!
Put your hands towards your father and just

29:52.630 --> 29:53.630
think of him.

29:53.630 --> 29:56.090
And then he said there is a piercing pain
here.

29:56.090 --> 29:59.903
(Shri Mataji showing the palm of her right
hand right below the vishudhi finger and the

29:59.903 --> 30:03.700
soft area below the fingers and around the
Sahastrara of the palm) I said see, these

30:03.700 --> 30:04.700
are the centers of your father.

30:04.700 --> 30:10.519
And this finger (Vishudhi) if it is so piercing
then he must be down with bad bronchitis.

30:10.519 --> 30:12.480
So he said, Really?

30:12.480 --> 30:13.480
I said yes.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.769
I said, Alright! You telephone to your father
and find out.

30:15.769 --> 30:20.679
He telephoned, his mother came on the phone
and she said exactly the same sentence.

30:20.679 --> 30:24.779
“Your father is down with very bad bronchitis."

30:24.779 --> 30:26.780
So, he was amazed.

30:26.780 --> 30:31.840
Andbut then he was convinced and that’s
how he saw gradually it works.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.840
It’s fantastic.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.840
But it does happen.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.450
So the doubt starting disappearing.

30:36.450 --> 30:41.539
So then he rose to the position of doubtless
awareness.

30:41.539 --> 30:44.830
But it is not a mental activity.

30:44.830 --> 30:47.090
It is a growth within you.

30:47.090 --> 30:52.240
When that growth takes place then you have
a great power that you can give realization

30:52.240 --> 30:53.419
to others.

30:53.419 --> 30:58.490
With the movement of your hand, you can give
realization.

30:58.490 --> 31:02.679
You can see what’s happening to others on
your fingertips.

31:02.679 --> 31:06.409
And you feel completely blissful.

31:06.409 --> 31:07.700
Absolutely at ease.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.500
At that point of peace where nothing can disturb
you.

31:10.500 --> 31:15.600
You are in your fortress.  You are just sitting
there and watching the whole world like a

31:15.600 --> 31:16.789
drama.

31:16.789 --> 31:18.730
It’s a big joke.

31:18.730 --> 31:23.840
It’s a big…you witness the whole thing
as just some sort of a play going on.

31:23.840 --> 31:29.440
And that is the state which comes to you which
establishes itself and you become that.

31:29.440 --> 31:34.010
Then you are no more (*UNCLEAR) or upset with
anything.

31:34.010 --> 31:36.360
As it is you are blessed.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.690
Physically, mentally, emotionally, materially
in every way.

31:38.690 --> 31:39.779
But you don’t become Mr.

31:39.779 --> 31:42.389
Ford because that’s a headache.

31:42.389 --> 31:46.510
Satisfy and your problems of material wellbeing
are solved.

31:46.510 --> 31:53.100
Here we have somebody, who is sitting there,
who had material problems (*UNCLEAR) problems

31:53.100 --> 31:56.549
and he came from India and was very upset.

31:56.549 --> 32:01.259
He happens to meet me, he knew me very well
otherwise as my husband was Chairman of Shipping

32:01.259 --> 32:02.259
Corporation.

32:02.259 --> 32:05.470
He (*) he didn’t know that I was also this.

32:05.470 --> 32:07.349
See you have a double life.

32:07.349 --> 32:11.580
So he just met me and I told him that you
have a problem with financial things.

32:11.580 --> 32:12.969
He said, yes, how do you know?

32:12.969 --> 32:17.370
I said, I know because your center is catching
on the right hand side and if Nabhi center

32:17.370 --> 32:24.159
is catching on the right hand side and left
side definitely you must have material problems.

32:24.159 --> 32:25.290
He said, that’s true.

32:25.290 --> 32:26.500
I said alright.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.669
I gave him realization.

32:28.669 --> 32:34.750
I  just checked his Nabhi Chakra and you
will be amazed to know that he started doing

32:34.750 --> 32:35.750
very well.

32:35.750 --> 32:36.750
Now he is a happy man.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.029
He is a satisfied man.

32:38.029 --> 32:39.171
He has got his family here.

32:39.171 --> 32:41.330
He is a very happy person.

32:41.330 --> 32:42.629
It works out.

32:42.629 --> 32:47.780
So this works out in many ways and that’s
how you start understanding it is in doubtless

32:47.780 --> 32:48.780
awareness.

32:48.780 --> 32:55.600
For this in “Hatha Yoga” of “Patanjali”
is called as “Ritambhara Pragya”.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.360
Ritam- bhara-Pragya.

32:57.360 --> 33:05.750
Ritambhara Pragya means the knowledge of that
power of Mother Earth which fills it up with

33:05.750 --> 33:07.470
all the seasons.

33:07.470 --> 33:12.320
You’ll be amazed how you will be helped.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.750
You will be so much surprised, how things
work out.

33:14.750 --> 33:17.279
You don’t have to worry about anything.

33:17.279 --> 33:22.950
Everything works out so smoothly that you
are, as if there is a red carpet for you and

33:22.950 --> 33:25.060
you are going on a magical carpet somewhere.

33:25.060 --> 33:27.649
All kinds of problems get solved.

33:27.649 --> 33:32.740
And you are amazed as you are on top of all
these things and you can help others also.

33:32.740 --> 33:38.009
The person who is a Sahaja yogi of a high
value if he enters in a house it becomes auspicious.

33:38.009 --> 33:41.570
The person get all the blessings of the auspiciousness.

33:41.570 --> 33:47.629
I have seen people who have reported to me
that such and such person came to our house

33:47.629 --> 33:53.260
and since that day Mother, my wife got cured,
my son got cured, everything became so much

33:53.260 --> 33:54.260
better.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.260
We are much better people.

33:55.260 --> 34:02.549
We had lost all the money in the business
but we are doing very well now.

34:02.549 --> 34:03.889
So many people write to me.

34:03.889 --> 34:09.860
Recently I received a letter, there is a lady
who is a widow and somebody wrote to me, a

34:09.860 --> 34:11.820
wife of a gentleman called MR.

34:11.820 --> 34:19.740
Dalvi that Mother, your daughter such and
such has cured my husband of his cancer.

34:19.740 --> 34:25.400
He was about to die, he had galloping cancer
and now I am a lucky woman to have my husband

34:25.400 --> 34:26.860
back at home.

34:26.860 --> 34:27.880
So these things happen.

34:27.880 --> 34:31.890
So many such things can happen because you
are a powerful thing.

34:31.890 --> 34:35.710
You must have, just have the power to feel
yourself.

34:35.710 --> 34:36.710
That’s all.

34:36.710 --> 34:38.420
If it works, it works.

34:38.420 --> 34:43.550
If it does not work I can not help it but
gradually it can be helped.

34:43.550 --> 34:45.430
That’s why you have to come to the center.

34:45.430 --> 34:47.950
Because it’s a collective work.

34:47.950 --> 34:51.010
Now the time has come for us to work it out
collectively.

34:51.010 --> 34:52.750
You cannot just sit at home.

34:52.750 --> 34:55.350
Oh! I have got Mother’s photograph, everything
is alright.

34:55.350 --> 34:56.350
No.

34:56.350 --> 34:57.350
you all have to meet together.

34:57.350 --> 34:58.910
Understand each other’s difficulty.

34:58.910 --> 35:00.700
It works much better.

35:00.700 --> 35:06.540
Supposing one person has a strong say, Nabhi
Chakra another one has got a Heart Chakra

35:06.540 --> 35:11.450
so when they meet, they supply the energy
which is needed by integration.

35:11.450 --> 35:12.590
And that is what has to happen.

35:12.590 --> 35:15.980
At the last center, you have all the seven
centers placed here (Shri Mataji pointing

35:15.980 --> 35:17.840
towards her head to show the chakras.) all
the seven centers.

35:17.840 --> 35:22.690
(TIME: 35:16) and when the kundalini rises
in that area (Sahastrara) then all the integration

35:22.690 --> 35:25.450
of these seven centers takes place.

35:25.450 --> 35:28.600
That’s how become an integrated personality.

35:28.600 --> 35:32.690
Whatever you do, you do it sincerely.

35:32.690 --> 35:37.550
You do not have a mind somewhere, you don’t
want to do it but you have to do it because

35:37.550 --> 35:38.760
rationally it is good.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.040
It will fetch more money.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.860
Nothing of the kind you do it because it is
absolute.

35:43.860 --> 35:47.980
Because you think that is the thing you have
to do.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.840
And that’s how you get the courage.

35:49.840 --> 35:55.020
To stand up against all non-sense that talks
of disintegration.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.140
Talks of hatred.

35:56.140 --> 36:05.590
Talks of wars and you become such a powerful
personality that all those who come in contact

36:05.590 --> 36:08.320
with you also have that peace within themselves.

36:08.320 --> 36:11.720
They feel that peace and they also rise to
that.

36:11.720 --> 36:16.770
We have to have so many people like that on
this earth to change this world.

36:16.770 --> 36:20.400
And I am sure one day will come where it will
work out.

36:20.400 --> 36:29.350
Television is discovered only for Sahaja Yoga
because on television if they allowed me to

36:29.350 --> 36:33.180
ask you to put your hands towards me, I could
have given you realization then.

36:33.180 --> 36:39.000
Possibly! So this, what you call…a camera.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.820
Is also for Sahaja Yoga.

36:40.820 --> 36:42.610
There are many photographs of mine which you
will see, is amazing.

36:42.610 --> 36:47.350
See I was sitting in a school.

36:47.350 --> 36:53.030
In a village school, just an ordinary school.

36:53.030 --> 36:57.820
Outside, in a very small little school and
talking to people.

36:57.820 --> 37:01.150
Suddenly the rays of light started coming
on me.

37:01.150 --> 37:05.330
Off course, I told them (Editted/missing*)
a great saint had lived.

37:05.330 --> 37:07.840
Seven times, the light came on me.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.030
I knew that.

37:09.030 --> 37:11.610
Nobody knew that there was light coming on
me but then I put my hand like that and said

37:11.610 --> 37:13.240
“Bas! (means enough/stop in hindi) that’s
all.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.840
I laughed and said, No “bas! That’s it”.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.890
Alright! And at that time it stopped.

37:19.890 --> 37:22.090
But some lady was taking photographs.

37:22.090 --> 37:25.130
She took seven photographs of all those seven
poses.

37:25.130 --> 37:26.130
One of them is here.

37:26.130 --> 37:28.650
That one is not here where I stopped it also.

37:28.650 --> 37:31.780
It’s a very nice photograph of mine.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.550
So this camera is doing so much justice to
Sahaja Yoga.

37:33.550 --> 37:37.440
It is catching all that you cannot see.

37:37.440 --> 37:42.260
And that is why, I would say that all modern
science is for this communication.  To the

37:42.260 --> 37:47.560
whole world the message that you all have
to become the spirit.

37:47.560 --> 37:52.110
That is the achievement that we have to have.

37:52.110 --> 37:55.530
Otherwise all the rest of it is absolutely
useless.

37:55.530 --> 37:57.410
Absolutely useless.

37:57.410 --> 38:02.330
And when today that Indian gentleman told
me that Indians will never for God because

38:02.330 --> 38:06.320
they are only interested in money when they
come here and rest of them won’t come to

38:06.320 --> 38:09.700
you because you have to ask them to pay some
money for you.

38:09.700 --> 38:14.620
I was really very much disappointed and I
said, is this the level of human beings?

38:14.620 --> 38:15.890
I don’t think it is so.

38:15.890 --> 38:19.710
Hope so, it is not so that people just don’t
care for money.

38:19.710 --> 38:20.780
Money is nothing.

38:20.780 --> 38:21.780
What is it?

38:21.780 --> 38:23.950
It is just the dust of the feet of the Lord.

38:23.950 --> 38:24.950
It is nothing.

38:24.950 --> 38:25.950
It is nothing important.

38:25.950 --> 38:28.950
But by telling all these things it does not
work out.

38:28.950 --> 38:33.590
Once you get your realization automatically
you will become so detached about money.

38:33.590 --> 38:35.150
Though living in the same.

38:35.150 --> 38:40.320
I live now, like a….because I am married
to a man who is in a big position.

38:40.320 --> 38:44.610
I live according to what he has rewards me
to live in that position.

38:44.610 --> 38:46.290
But from inside, I am absolutely detached.

38:46.290 --> 38:49.330
In the same way, it will happen to you.

38:49.330 --> 38:53.760
You won’t be involved with (it*UNCLEAR)
only thing- the matter has one value that

38:53.760 --> 38:55.200
you can give it to others.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.490
That you can express your love for others.

38:57.490 --> 38:58.850
Today I was shopping.

38:58.850 --> 39:03.390
Buying presents for friends, and things for
sahaja yogis where the children are.

39:03.390 --> 39:05.410
What to give them.

39:05.410 --> 39:09.540
That’s a big attraction for me that we should
buy some present for them.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.470
And this is the thing one has to achieve.

39:11.470 --> 39:17.050
There is nothing else out of this matter that
you can except for this joy of (*UNCLEAR)

39:17.050 --> 39:18.050
that you give somethings.

39:18.050 --> 39:22.830
In the same way, people give to God also like
they will give a flower.

39:22.830 --> 39:24.800
Flower is the best thing you can give.

39:24.800 --> 39:29.040
But when you started talking off money I don’t
know what to do.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.110
I feel like vomiting.

39:30.110 --> 39:35.370
My stomach goes into funny condition I just
don’t know how to tell you that it is an

39:35.370 --> 39:40.260
insult to think in the term of human beings
of God.

39:40.260 --> 39:42.520
God doesn’t understand money at all.

39:42.520 --> 39:47.430
Not at all! So please try to understand that
even if you are not paying money, doesn’t

39:47.430 --> 39:48.430
matter.

39:48.430 --> 39:50.040
It’s your right to have your realization.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.640
This is the greatest wealth you have.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.710
Today you have your realization or yesterday
you must have had.

39:55.710 --> 39:58.570
You must see to it, persue it, be serious
about it.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.240
We should not be shallow people.

40:00.240 --> 40:06.540
We should not be shallow at all that today
you receive your realization and tomorrow

40:06.540 --> 40:08.561
you forget about it and you do nothing about
it.

40:08.561 --> 40:10.210
it will worse thing.

40:10.210 --> 40:14.510
Because when the seed is sprouted it has to
become the tree otherwise it is absolutely

40:14.510 --> 40:15.510
ruined.

40:15.510 --> 40:21.390
It is important that when you get your realization,
you look after yourself.  Go deeper into

40:21.390 --> 40:22.390
it.

40:22.390 --> 40:23.740
you can meet here we have a center.

40:23.740 --> 40:26.150
I am leaving some people here for you to talk
to.

40:26.150 --> 40:29.290
Who are very senior people they’ll tell
all about Sahaja Yoga.

40:29.290 --> 40:30.910
About yourself, about your problems.

40:30.910 --> 40:32.370
May God Bless you.

40:32.370 --> 40:36.960
As Gavin has told you today that I have to
go today because tomorrow they have fixed

40:36.960 --> 40:39.850
a program at 7 o’clock in the morning in
Los Angeles.

40:39.850 --> 40:41.960
So  I am sorry, I have to leave today.

40:41.960 --> 40:46.930
I hope you will be able to achieve what I
have told you.

40:46.930 --> 40:52.980
I will just go in for a little program of
self realization.

40:52.980 --> 40:57.710
Offcourse I don’t (*UNCLEAR) if fit works
out.

40:57.710 --> 40:59.490
Nothing like it.

40:59.490 --> 41:03.350
if it doesn’t work out, nobody should be
disappointed about it.

41:03.350 --> 41:09.060
And one should be contented that it will happen
if not today, it will happen tomorrow.

41:09.060 --> 41:10.860
Yesterday so many people felt it.

41:10.860 --> 41:12.820
and also today you should feel it.

41:12.820 --> 41:29.570
Now, if you have any questions, you should
ask them now.

41:29.570 --> 41:34.490
What’s the time Nick?

41:34.490 --> 41:38.680
You just put your hands towards me like this
and close your eyes.

41:38.680 --> 41:43.910
Just put your hands, both the hands like this
(palms open) and close your eyes.

41:43.910 --> 41:46.780
Put your hands on your lap so that you are
comfortable.

41:46.780 --> 41:48.440
First thing is you have to be comfortable.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.240
Put both the feet (*UNC:EAR) parallel.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.240
Away.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.140
Little bit away from each other.

41:53.140 --> 41:57.850
Because there are problems on the left sometimes,
there are problems of the right and if they

41:57.850 --> 42:01.260
are little away its easy to handle.

42:01.260 --> 42:08.300
Now the left side, left hand- as I told you
is the hand by which you desire.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.300
Is the hand of desire.

42:09.300 --> 42:11.200
It is the hand of desire, expressing the power
of desire.

42:11.200 --> 42:16.150
So keep the left hand straight towards me
like this that the desire is to become one

42:16.150 --> 42:17.150
with the divine.

42:17.150 --> 42:22.680
Now the right hand, you have to use it to
raise your kundalini.

42:22.680 --> 42:31.210
First of all, you have to put your right hand
on your heart.

42:31.210 --> 42:32.450
Close your eyes.

42:32.450 --> 42:34.110
Please close your eyes.

42:34.110 --> 42:44.310
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
don’t feel guilty.

42:44.310 --> 42:46.790
Please don’t feel guilty.

42:46.790 --> 42:48.370
You are in the present.

42:48.370 --> 42:49.610
Forget the past.

42:49.610 --> 42:50.610
Forget the past.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.300
You are in the present.

42:52.300 --> 42:55.890
Just now you forget what you have done, what
wrong you have committed.

42:55.890 --> 43:06.040
Forget it! and now you have to say with full
confidence within yourself you can ask a question

43:06.040 --> 43:07.270
to me.

43:07.270 --> 43:13.620
Addressing me as Mother if you like, or as
Shri Mataji.

43:13.620 --> 43:16.690
-Mother, am I the spirit?

43:16.690 --> 43:20.360
Ask the question thrice.

43:20.360 --> 43:38.640
If you are an indian ask the question- “kya
main atma hoon?

43:38.640 --> 43:47.770
Maa kya main atma hoon?’’ Sincerely.

43:47.770 --> 43:54.570
Now put this right hand, keep the left hand
as it is.

43:54.570 --> 43:55.600
Don’t open your eyes.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.050
Put the right hand on the stomach on left
hand side.

43:59.050 --> 44:02.970
This is the center of the primordial master.

44:02.970 --> 44:06.570
And your principle of mastery has to be awakened.

44:06.570 --> 44:16.410
We call it as “Guru Tattwa” now, put your
hand there and press it hard.

44:16.410 --> 44:25.010
At this point- you have to assert because
if you are the spirit, you are your own master.

44:25.010 --> 44:26.570
So please say-

44:26.570 --> 44:29.220
-Mother, I am my own master.

44:29.220 --> 44:31.450
Say it ten times.

44:31.450 --> 44:36.470
With full confidence.  Don’t feel guilty
while saying that.

44:36.470 --> 44:37.470
You are.

44:37.470 --> 44:38.470
You are the spirit.

44:38.470 --> 44:39.470
Sprit is quite intact.

44:39.470 --> 44:41.930
(it * UNCLEAR) its never ruined.

44:41.930 --> 44:46.760
it never does any harm its there, all intact.

44:46.760 --> 44:50.900
Just say- Mother, I am my own guru.

44:50.900 --> 45:00.590
I am my own master.

45:00.590 --> 45:05.970
Please say it ten times.

45:05.970 --> 45:13.990
Because this center has got ten petals.

45:13.990 --> 45:19.580
Now raise the right hand on heart again.

45:19.580 --> 45:21.640
Press it a little bit.

45:21.640 --> 45:28.350
At this point, you have to assert now twelve
times.

45:28.350 --> 45:39.110
Saying that Mother- I am (*UNCLEAR) , I am
the spirit.

45:39.110 --> 45:40.110
Which you are.

45:40.110 --> 45:41.110
No doubt.

45:41.110 --> 45:49.870
You have to just asset it.

45:49.870 --> 46:07.750
Now, raise this hand higher, at the base of
your neck on the left hand side.

46:07.750 --> 46:08.750
On the shoulder.

46:08.750 --> 46:09.750
Don’t open your eyes please.

46:09.750 --> 46:13.980
At this point, you have to say- Mother- I
am not guilty.

46:13.980 --> 46:17.950
Please say it sixteen times.

46:17.950 --> 46:21.930
Push it on the shoulder.

46:21.930 --> 46:28.710
Raise it higher, push it on the shoulder.

46:28.710 --> 46:37.980
And hold it tight at the base of your neck.

46:37.980 --> 47:09.610
Mother, I am not guilty.

47:09.610 --> 47:21.770
Now raise your right hand higher onto the
forehead.

47:21.770 --> 47:25.090
Put your palm across your forehead, across.

47:25.090 --> 47:32.520
At this point- you have to say- Mother, I
forgive everyone.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.760
Really say that.

47:34.760 --> 47:42.870
Without questioning, please say- Mother I
forgive everyone.

47:42.870 --> 48:28.210
Now only you can say without feeling guilty
that, if I have done anything wrong, please

48:28.210 --> 48:29.650
Oh Lord! Forgive me.

48:29.650 --> 48:33.980
Anything wrong if I have done knowingly or
unknowingly please forgive me.

48:33.980 --> 48:36.930
For this you have to put back your hand on
the backside of your head.

48:36.930 --> 48:39.960
Please say that but don’t feel guilty.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.550
Please don’t feel guilty.

48:42.550 --> 48:56.780
Without feeling guilty you have to say -if
I have done anything wrong, Oh Lord! Please

48:56.780 --> 49:01.610
forgive me.

49:01.610 --> 49:12.280
Now put right hand on top of your head.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.280
And try to press it.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
and move it clockwise a little bit.

49:14.280 --> 49:19.080
On top of your head, where you had soft bone
in your childhood.

49:19.080 --> 49:25.420
Press it hard.

49:25.420 --> 49:27.600
At this point I cannot cross your freedom.

49:27.600 --> 49:32.140
So you have to say that you want your realization.

49:32.140 --> 49:34.760
You just say- Mother I want my realization.

49:34.760 --> 49:40.680
Please give me my realization.

49:40.680 --> 49:48.790
Say it seven times.

49:48.790 --> 50:11.110
Now raise your hand and see if there is cool
breeze coming out.

50:11.110 --> 50:23.270
You can change over and see on top of your
head, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

50:23.270 --> 50:26.940
Put your right hand towards me as you have
put the left hand.

50:26.940 --> 50:30.080
Right hand towards me now and put your left
hand up and see.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.080
It’s there.

50:31.080 --> 50:32.080
(Mother smiling) see it’s there.

50:32.080 --> 50:33.080
Change over.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.080
You can change over.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.080
Put your right.

50:35.080 --> 51:12.570
(Shri Mataji blows air into the mic a few
times) now again you can change hand and you

51:12.570 --> 51:48.660
can see it is there.

51:48.660 --> 52:32.430
(Shri Mataji takes some water from the cup
near her and rub it on her Sahastrara and

52:32.430 --> 52:34.490
a little bit at the back on right nabhi) after
a break of few moments….

52:34.490 --> 52:45.400
Now, you open your eyes, I will teach you
how to raise your own kundalini.

52:45.400 --> 52:52.190
Can you hold it for me?

52:52.190 --> 53:05.920
(Shri Mataji asks someone to hold the mic)
this hand, the left hand you have to put it

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
in front of you just like this before the
kundalini.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.380
Just like this.

53:08.380 --> 53:11.910
You can do it at home also.

53:11.910 --> 53:15.250
This is your own hand and your own kundalini.

53:15.250 --> 53:16.810
This is the hand.

53:16.810 --> 53:21.690
Now the right hand, you have to move it up,
forward, down, backwards.

53:21.690 --> 53:24.400
Like this in a clockwise manner.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.670
Now let’s start, moving it.

53:26.670 --> 53:30.750
one hand is moving up and another is going
round like this manner.

53:30.750 --> 53:31.720
Take it up.
