00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.029
Today, I met a gentleman who told me – who
is an Indian, that as far as Indians are concerned

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.290
they have come here to make money.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.290
Not to know God.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.160
So they are not interested in you.  And the
other people here, they won’t listen to

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160
you.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.460
They will come to your program and go away.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.760
I said- why?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.120
Because you can’t pin them down without
you get some money out of them.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.040
(Shri Mataji laughs in astonishment).

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.410
I said, “how much are they going to pay
me?” He said, “Whatever you like” You

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.910
must understand their psychology.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.950
If you do not take any money from them, they
won’t be bothered.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.579
You see, he told me an American psychology
which was really very shocking.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.020
He said, they talk like this- “I have paid
for this."

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.320
If they have paid for it, they will go though
it whatever it is.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.510
Otherwise they will not go through it.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.910
And it was too much for me.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.110
I said- “I can’t believe it."

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.300
How can that be?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.210
There are true seekers in this world.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.299
Those who are truthful seekers will understand
that you can not pay for what you have already

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.850
within yourself.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:19.159
And this is what one has to realize that God
has built you up in such a fashion that everything

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.440
is within you.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.870
You have got your spirit in your heart.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.500
As I told you before and then you have got
that vital force within you * or that divine

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.320
force within you called as Kundalini.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.160
The true desire * This is the true desire.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.930
The rest of them as I told you are not true
desires as they do not give you satisfaction.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.640
So this is the true desire within you which
has to work it out and when it works out,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.790
you become yourself.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.300
Means you know what powers you have, and you
can manifest your own power.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.310
It seems very fantastic to hear that we have
all these powers within us that we can cure

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.799
ourselves, we can cure others.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.330
We can cure our mental problems and we can
cure others’ mental problems.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.340
We can solve many problems of money and other
nonsensical things about which we are worried.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.440
Our priorities change.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.940
We become transformed and we become collectively
conscious.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.180
So we can treat others and we can know about
ourselves.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.530
Seems to be very fantastic but as I told you
that you are made into this beautiful body

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.840
with great care and love in such a beautiful
way.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.650
I’ll show you that.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.819
Now all these centers exist within you.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.590
You need not take me for granted but they
exist.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.730
And when the kundalini rises, she passes through
all these various centers and enlightens them

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.730
and nourishes them.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.220
It’s a fact that this knowledge was known
to Indians, great seers of Indians, thousands

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.709
of years back.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.030
But we had three types of practices in India.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.599
The first one was where people were in devotion
to God.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.100
They wanted help from God and they thought
that by praying to God, by (meditating*Unclear)

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.540
themselves to God they will be able to achieve
the advent of God.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.590
So they were praying for the advent of God,
that was one sided.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.310
Left sided people as we can call it.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.310
Who worship.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.110
The right sided people are the people who
thought that it is better to excite and awaken

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:45.840
the different elements by which we can be
benefited.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.790
And that’s how they tried to do “yagnas”(hawan).

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:56.140
“yagnas” means a kind of a ritual by which
you can excite or by which you can use the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.180
power of the elements.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.069
And that’s how they did lot of rituals by
which they tried to overpower and they had

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:15.170
(unclear*) quite a lot of development long
time back about…They say that in India we

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.749
had aeroplanes, pilot lessons aeroplanes where
it was about eight thousand years back.

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:26.240
So, whether you believe it or not but they
tried to do it through this method of exciting

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:37.529
or knowing the subtle side of the elements
and how to use it for their own purposes.

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:44.610
And the third side (Unclear*) was where people
tried to find out, Sorry! …(Unclear*) they

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.030
tried to find out why we are here?

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.569
Why God has created us?

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:51.969
What does he want us to do?

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.349
Why should we live on this world like this?

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.990
Because they realized that this is not the
ultimate.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.229
We have not found absolute.

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.680
And such people meditated.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.080
Through their meditative approach they reached
certain heights.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.779
They found out certain secrets about ourselves
and they described all these chakras that

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.759
I am describing to you fourteen thousand years
back.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.180
It’s nothing new , the tact(*Unclear).

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:26.580
Only thing, I am giving it a modern connection!
That all these subtle centers are within us

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.580
and they manifest outside   .

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.160
All the known plexuses and ductless gland.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.860
For example the (*Unclear) the Nabhi Chakra.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.060
This one manifests the (*Edited.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.330
Part of the speech missing) We have the pelvic
plexus and then we have the aortic plexus,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.639
then solar plexus, then cardiac plexus and
here we have the cervical plexus.

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:58.479
And here at optic chiasma, we have got a very
subtle center, which we call as agya chakra.

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.949
Which controls the pituitary and the pineal
and is placed on the optic chiasma.

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.050
In the cross of that.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.839
So this is the center.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:14.410
And the limbic area which doctors know about,
is the one which is enclosed by the ego and

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.099
super ego of human beings.

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.009
That’s how we have all the picture.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:19.860
This is the tree of life.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.849
Now, the tree of life is ready, only thing-
it is to be nourished.

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.550
And for that nourishment, that kundalini is
placed there.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.899
I am sorry, you can’t see?

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:31.059
(Shri Mataji makes a physical move to the
side).

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:37.529
And this kundalini is nothing else but is
the Aquarius within you.

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.659
That’s why it is called as the age of the
Aquarius.

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.559
Many people don’t know, why is it called
as the age of the Aquarius?

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:51.050
Aquarius means the water carrier and this
is the one that is the water carrier within

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.050
us.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.599
The sacrum, the sacred bone in which this
power is there and this power is your Mother.

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:04.051
And when she nourishes you, you solve all
these problems that I told you.

00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:10.190
You solve your spiritual problem and ultimately
you become one with your spirit.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.449
It is a very simple thing because nature does
everything in a very simple way.

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.959
As I told you yesterday, if you have to sprout
a seed- you just put it in the mother earth.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.849
What do you do?

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:22.849
Nothing else.

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:23.979
Mother earth has got the capacity.

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.849
In the same way, when this has to rise, it
has to rise spontaneously.

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:39.369
Now the idea, you must clean yourself, you
must do this and that…is not necessary.

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:43.309
Say when you are sitting in your car, you
have to get out of it to correct it.

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:50.709
So first, get out of it, not only that but
you get the light to see what’s wrong with

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:51.709
you.

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:56.520
In that light, you understand what’s wrong
with you, you correct yourself so Nobody has

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520
to tell you.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.649
You correct yourself.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:01.179
And by correcting yourself, what do you get?

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:07.610
You get an absolute being within yourself
which is the spirit.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.649
So now, the time has come for you to get integration.

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:18.339
The complete synthesis of all the religions
has to come to (*UNCLEAR) but its not a mental

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:19.800
projection, again I would say.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.729
It’s not a mental projection, I should say
that all the religions are one.

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:25.460
Nobody is going to understand that.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.460
It’s nonsense.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.319
Because people say, how if all religions are
the same, why are they fighting with each

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:32.319
other?

00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:34.550
They are having wars, they had wars, they
are having wars, they’ll have wars.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:40.209
So how is it possible that all these religions
are coming from one tree.

00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:42.610
They are flowers of one tree.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.240
How can that be?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.240
That has to be seen.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.269
If it is so or not?

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:55.740
When it happens, you automatically realize
that all of them belong to the same tree of

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.740
life.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.060
And these different destinations that you
see are not actually the destination but are

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.779
the milestones in our life time by which we
rise.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.750
Now many people have a habit that they stuck
on to one chakra.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.449
For example, those who are hindus, will just
believe in “Krishna” and nobody else.

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:15.720
Krishna is just here (Shri Mataji pointing
towards the Vishudhi Chakra on her neck) he

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.480
came six thousand years back.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480
He is here.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.740
Then some will believe only in Rama.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.740
Rama is just here.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.180
(Shree Mataji pointing towards her heart chakra
to show Shri Rama’s place).

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.140
Or some will believe only in Christ, Christ
is here (Shree Mataji pointing on her forehead,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.410
where her Kumkum is) Now Christ is just here.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.100
He is the Gate, Alright! But he is not the
destination.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.480
So what is the destination?

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.500
Is the Limbic Area.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.670
You have to enter into the kingdom of God,
he said it.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.670
He always talked of the future.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.300
He said you have to enter into the kingdom
of God, Holy Ghost has to come.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:49.870
He said that you are to get somebody who will
counsel you, you will redeem you, who will

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.120
comfort you.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.170
And that is the Holy Ghost.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.561
Off Couse he did not say that it’s a lady,
because he thought that if I say it’s a

00:09:57.561 --> 00:10:01.519
Mother, they will be all towards his Mother,
attack her.

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:03.000
And he didn’t want to do that.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.290
To loose all the drama of crucifixion.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:10.310
So he didn’t say that it was my mother who
is one of the powers of God but he just kept

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.329
quiet about it.

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:19.529
But you…As I said this afternoon that it
is impossible to understand how people rationalize

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.360
that there is a Holy Ghost, there is a Father
and there is a Son.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.639
And No Mother.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.439
It’s an impossible.

00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:32.120
And you can understand it clearly that there
has to be a Mother, who has to come up and

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120
nourish.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.209
Now you, (*Editted/skipped portion) who opposed
Freud said it very clearly that it is the

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:42.250
Mother who is going to nourish us.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.170
He even took the name of Kundalini.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.680
He studied upto that point.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:52.160
But the mistake was when he tried to talk
about it, his knowledge was that of a person

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.930
who jumped on the stage.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.750
Suddenly! And he is trying to know over the
stage.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.720
So it can be mistaken also.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.290
And he got quite confused because he said
that to get to the unconscious you have to

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.290
pass the subconscious.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.180
And the other day I explained to you that
there are four areas of unconscious.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.250
Means from four areas we do not get any messages.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.250
We are unconscious of it because we don’t
feel it on the central nervous system.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.140
Now these four areas I have told you before
and I’ll repeat them again.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.370
On the left hand side, as you see of the person.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.060
(Shri Mataji explaining on the chakra chart
various aspects) On this side means facing,

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.060
we should see the left side where the hand
is like this.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:40.290
Is the blue line as you see is called as the
Ida Channel which gives the manifestation.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.680
In the gross of the left sympathetic nervous
system which looks after our emotions.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.800
And beyond that is the subconscious and the
collective subconscious.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.439
On the right hand side, when we think of the
future too much, plan for the future too much

00:11:56.439 --> 00:12:02.199
then we enter into the area called supra conscious
and collective supra conscious.

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:04.540
Now down below as you see, there is hell.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.709
The collective hell.

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:09.519
We live in hell and we have collective hell
also.

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:12.769
Above, on top your head, is the super consciousness.

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:13.990
Which is unconscious.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:19.170
Just now, you do not feel it on your central
nervous system so it is unconscious.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.699
To make it conscious what we have to do is
to, bring into your consciousness on to your

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:29.420
central nervous system the existence of your
spirit.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.730
Once that comes in your consciousness.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.730
In your attention.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.029
Then you start feeling the all pervading power.

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:39.629
The subtle power, which does all the living
thing.

00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:42.850
Like creating the flowers, like creating fruits
out of the flowers.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.600
Every sort of a living work is done by that
all pervading power.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.910
Now for that, what can you pay?

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.010
What can you pay?

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:53.029
That’s one thing.

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:56.290
One should understand that you can’t pay
for all this thing.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.339
This is your own.

00:12:57.339 --> 00:12:58.570
It is within you.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.649
I am paid for it already.

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:02.850
You can think like that.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.029
And it is within you.

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:05.029
The whole power is within you.

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.600
You have to just get to it.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.630
Now, I do not want to criticize any religious
bodies as such but they are doing all the

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.630
upside down things.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.790
You can see for yourself.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.170
You’ll be amazed in London, people are selling
the churches.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.089
And they are having their pubs.

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:22.629
I mean after (*Editted/skipped portion) something
of the same kind.

00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:23.830
So what is the reason.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.190
Now, what is the reason?

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.699
Not only that but in Indian temples same thing
happening.

00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:29.999
In mosques also same thing happening.

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:33.399
In all the other religions the same thing
is happening.

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:34.910
Jews are having the same problem.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.570
Unless and Until you are a fanatic, nobody
is bothered about you.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.790
But fanaticism is a disease.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.699
Because they believe in one center.

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:45.089
One part of it.

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:49.290
I’ll give you an example, I met a gentleman
who came from Iran about ten years back to

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.579
see me.

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:54.709
He was a doctor and he was suffering from
stomach problem.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:55.750
Stomach cancer.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:02.370
Somebody told him in India that I may be able
to help him so he came down.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.850
He came to London to see me.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.330
When he came to London, he asked me, “Mother,
can you cure me?’’.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.800
I said, “I can, but have a disease."

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.040
He said, “What disease”?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.910
I said, “You are a fanatic."

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.910
He said “No."

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.420
I said, do you believe that only Mohammed
saa’b is the one for you?

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.499
He said, yes off course; I do not believe
in anybody else.

00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:29.870
I believe..(Shree Mataji asked someone if
they are recording or not) Any problem?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:53.540
(As someone tries to fix the mic/wires, Shree
Mataji says I don’t understand these things…laughter.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.870
I don’t understand these connections.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:07.069
I am absolutely ignorant about these things.)

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:11.939
So I told him, Let’s see now, if you believe
it’s only Mohammed Saa’b I can not cure

00:15:11.939 --> 00:15:12.939
you.

00:15:12.939 --> 00:15:14.790
Clear you of your problems.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.819
So he said, then what do you want me to say?

00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:21.110
I said, you have to say that Mohammed Saa’b
was one of the incarnations of the primordial

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.940
masters and there are many others who came
on this earth.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:32.990
For example- Abraham, Moses, some people in
India like Raja Janaka, Nanaka, all of them

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.800
were the incarnation of the same.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.820
He said “This I can not say."

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.559
I said, “Alright then! Go Ahead.

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:39.769
I can not cure you either."

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:43.319
If you are obstinate about it you go ahead.

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:47.160
If you believe in only one person, like Mohammed
Saa’b who is angry with you.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.300
Take it from me.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.160
Because he can not understand this kind of
a stupidity.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.410
He never did that.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.480
What he said was, all of them were prophets
and they have come on this earth and only

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.459
he said that “I am the seal!” Seal does
not mean that I have sealed them.

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:07.050
Means I am one of the samples of that.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.019
I am one of the symbols of that.

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:11.220
And that’s what he said.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.800
And they said he is the seal now, nobody can
come.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.360
How can it be?

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.610
When he himself has talked about resurrection
time, that when the resurrection time will

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.360
come your hands will speak.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.690
And there is “Assess” he called the kundalini
as “Assess” and that resides in the triangular

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.690
bone.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.639
All these things he says, he talks of the
resurrection day all these things he talk

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:37.480
and how can you say that Mohammed Saa’b
didn’t talk of all these things.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.619
He did very well.

00:16:38.619 --> 00:16:40.540
But people don’t want to have that.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.200
They don’t want to listen to it.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.970
They don’t want to understand it because
they want to use it for their own purposes.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:51.749
When they want to use it for their own purposes
they have their own concept of Mohammed Saa’b,

00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:58.220
about Christ, about Krishna, about Rama, about
everyone they have their own concept.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.139
And they want to live with that concept.

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:02.000
They do not want to get out of it.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.640
Because its beyond them.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.240
It is beyond them to get out of those concepts.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.130
Because they are bound by their ego.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.069
Ego, is one of the greatest myths we are carrying
with ourselves.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.260
And it make you absolutely stupid.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.720
Is the most stupid thing that is Ego.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:25.539
Ego is the thing which tells you that we do
this, we do that, we don’t do anything what

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:27.320
so ever.  What do we do?

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.120
Supposing, a tree is dead.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.390
You make it into a bench.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.010
Alright! Or a chair, or anything.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.340
Can you make a flower into a fruit?

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.350
Even one?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.870
You can not.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.390
So what do you do?

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.940
Its only stones, and dead wood you play with.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.580
What living work you have done?

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.580
Nothing.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.750
Nothong! Then what do you do?

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.799
Except for making a chair for yourself or
some sort of a comfort by which you become

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:58.929
absolutely a lethargic person.

00:17:58.929 --> 00:18:01.409
If you make a chair, you can not sit on the
ground.

00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:03.899
If you make a bed, you can not sleep on the
ground.

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:05.950
You become a slave of this matter.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.740
Graudually you start becoming a greater slave
and greater slave and ultimately you think,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.490
Oh..you are the lord of the matter.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.669
But the matter is ruling you.

00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:17.669
Suppose the electricity goes away, what will
happen to us?

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:19.190
Supposing we don’t get any petrol.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.179
Suddenly, everybody will be (*UNCLEAR WORD)
one day, electricity went off in New York,

00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:24.230
then what happened?

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:31.000
So much we are dependent on the matter now
and not our spirit.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.940
And that is the trouble with us that we have
to depend on our spirit and on that great

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.860
power of God who has created us.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.870
Who is the one who has done all this living
work.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.010
And who is going to do greater living work.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.029
We have to depend on that greater force of
life.

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:49.860
That higher force of life.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:56.250
And we have to say that, Oh Lord!, Please
give us that we deserve.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.809
And you will be amazed, how anxious he is
to give you that great thing.

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:06.460
To give you that (*BENEDICTION) that is your
right to have it.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.750
Sahaja means that.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.960
Sahaja means it is born with you.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.179
It’s your birth right to get realized.

00:19:12.179 --> 00:19:14.090
It’s your (TIME;19:21) birth right.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.330
You have to have it.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.039
But how many want to be realized.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:23.740
They want to belong to some group they belong
to this group or that group.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.690
I don’t know what people get by clubbing
themselves like this.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.420
Which is artificial clubbing, you know.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.010
I have to go in England, all kinds of clubs.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.240
I am sometimes surprised, how they have clubs
about.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.150
Like the people who hold their forks in the
left hand and the knives on the right hand

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.820
are one and those who hold the other way round
are another club.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.590
IT’s stupid.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.620
And such a wastage of time.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:55.030
They have conferences, meetings of a group....People
are coming all the way from Australia, from

00:19:55.030 --> 00:20:03.980
Japan, this that….and what do you come out
of there(*UNCLEAR) what is there to club?

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:11.299
And this clubbing shows in every walk of life
that we try to club under the name of something

00:20:11.299 --> 00:20:14.330
nonsensical or something that is hatred.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.840
When we hate others, then we club together.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.961
Like we have to hate this type of people or
that type of people.

00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:26.090
This type of people are bad, that type of
people are bad, and we have to aggress these

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.870
type of people or we have to protect ourselves
from these people.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.990
It’s all is hatred.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.399
A kind of a fear.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.399
All the time working.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:39.510
While God has created you all beautifully
to (*) off course there is variety.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.529
Variety has to be there.

00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:43.480
Without variety, you would look so horrid.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.779
I mean, imagine everybody looking just the
same.

00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:48.649
You would not know who is a lady or a gentleman?

00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:50.610
It happens these days, very common.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.799
My experience has been terrific this time
(Laughter) In programs, I call some gentleman

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:59.020
as a lady and he gets angry and he says No,
Mother I am a man.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.370
I said, I am sorry, see, I couldn’t make
out.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.370
You see.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.370
The way you are walking.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.260
The way you are dressed I just thought that
you must be a lady.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.460
What can I do?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.830
(*Editted/skipped) just human beings.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:15.210
He has made us men and women and children
and everything to create the mood of variety.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:22.789
And that mood of variety that gives us a special
absolute as human beings.

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:26.140
Animals do not have so much variety.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.630
Only the human beings have so much variety.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.860
And the craziness also that we have is our
specialty.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.279
Like animals will never create an atom bomb
to kill themselves.

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:38.760
I mean, Thank God they can’t.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:45.240
But we human beings can do such absurd thing
as to make a bomb just to kill ourselves or

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.900
to kill others who are our kith and kin.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:54.330
So this is what it is that we have now reached
a very precarious stage where everyone knows,

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.990
God knows what is going to happen.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:02.399
Everybody is frightened and this time we have
to know that as soon as we are transformed

00:22:02.399 --> 00:22:06.320
we are looked after by that Divine power.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:15.409
Krishna has said, “Yoga-Kshema vyamaham”
when yoga takes place, I look after your well

00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:16.409
being.

00:22:16.409 --> 00:22:17.409
Kshema is well being.

00:22:17.409 --> 00:22:19.480
So first yoga has to take place.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.529
It is not before yoga.

00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:25.284
Many people think “Oh we believe in God,
Oh! We used to go to the Church, we used to

00:22:25.284 --> 00:22:30.640
go to the temple, we always would worship
Krishna, everything.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.860
And we never got any benefit.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.809
So one should ask- were you connected?

00:22:36.809 --> 00:22:38.850
If you are not connected with God.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:48.399
If you are not one with God how will you get
anything that is your due?

00:22:48.399 --> 00:22:50.450
So first thing is yoga.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:54.269
Is to become one with the Divine.

00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:57.260
Establish the connection and that’s the
most important thing.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.720
Many people ask me- what about “Hath Yoga?”
In Hatha Yoga there are “Ashtangas” there

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.720
are eight folds.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.020
Out of which the main thing is “Ishwar-Pranidhan”.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:16.039
Ishwar Pranidhana is that you establish yourself
in such a way that God is establish within

00:23:16.039 --> 00:23:17.039
you.

00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:23.130
Means- First is self realization! Then you
know and it is logical.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:29.730
That once you know your kundalini has started
moving and you will know which center is catching

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:35.179
and what kind of an exercise you have to do,
what kind of “Dharana” means meditation

00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:36.179
you have to do.

00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:39.940
What mantras you have to say and unless and
until the kundalini is moving how will you

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.899
know which chakra it is catching?

00:23:44.899 --> 00:23:50.190
And that is why, it is essential that first
kundalini should be awakened.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:57.250
Once the kundalini is awakened you start feeling
her movement, you start feeling your chakras,

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.250
you start understanding all the blocks you
have.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.529
You start understanding what problems others
have.

00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:08.700
If you know how to cure them, if you know
how to put them right you can make the kundalini

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:14.470
rise straight and then once it comes out and
then you establish it.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.620
You have to establish it.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:25.480
Once its establish then only you will feel
that you are absolutely there.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.100
So the first power you get is of thoughtless
awareness.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:36.539
Which is called in Sanskrit as “Nirvichar-Samadhi”
It used to take ages in those days to establish

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:37.539
even “Nirvichar Samadhi”.

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:40.419
But I must be something the way I am doing
it so fast.

00:24:40.419 --> 00:24:42.000
It’s like a jet.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.100
The kundalini rises just like a jet.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.899
So there must be something about me but I
am not going to tell you anything about myself.

00:24:47.899 --> 00:24:51.850
It’s better that you know yourself first
and then you ask about me.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:56.440
It’s much safer for you and much safer for
you also.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:02.500
So when the kundalini rises, she comes up
through this center of Agya and when it crosses

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.559
through that time we become thoughtlessly
aware.

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:07.059
Then your attention is stationed.

00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:10.419
There is no thought in between.

00:25:10.419 --> 00:25:11.669
Like a thought rises and falls off.

00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:13.160
Another thought rises and falls off.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.770
(Shri Mataji uses her hand to express it as
a wave going up and coming down for thought

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.770
process).

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.240
You can see the rising of the thought but
falling you don’t see.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.559
In between these two thoughts there is a space
and that is the space which is the present.

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:30.779
When the kundalini rises, what she does - she
makes this thought weak or elongated.  By

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:35.450
that there is a space, that increases and
you stationed yourself in the present.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.059
You become thoughtlessly aware.

00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:39.230
Again, I say- you are aware.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.230
But you are thoughtless and you can watch
your thoughts.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.590
If you want to, you can create your thoughts
if you want to.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.130
That’s the first stage of kundalini awakening.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.460
But when she crosses up here (Shri Puts her
hand onto her Sahastrara) and she comes out

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:58.000
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your
head then I should say that you have got your

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.941
self -realization in the sense now, an egg
has become a bird.

00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:06.780
But still, there are many things of the egg
which are sticking on.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.970
AS every bird has to through away the shell
properly to come out or the Mother has to

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.110
work hard to through it away.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:18.590
And once that is taken away then complete
cleansing has to take place till the bird

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.899
is ready to fly.

00:26:19.899 --> 00:26:28.299
Then the bird is afraid still to fly and it
spreads its wings here and there but it doesn’t

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:29.299
fly.

00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:33.559
So the Mother bird hides herself and calls
the little ones.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:39.799
After sometime, the birds spreads the wings,
goes up, flies upto a point.

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:41.820
It thinks it is falling down, falls.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:48.460
Again it rises, again it falls ultimately
it achieves that state where it starts flying

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.480
very well straight forward.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:56.610
When that is achieved, that state we call
as “Doubtless Awareness” called as “Nirvikalpa

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:02.350
Samadhi” But in the olden times these were
divide into two -two.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:06.510
First was “Svichar Samadhi then second was
“Nirvichar Samadhi”.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.910
Means first the Samadhi means the enlightened
mind.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:16.139
So first the enlightened mind with the thoughts
in then the second one was the thoughtless

00:27:16.139 --> 00:27:17.500
enlightened mind.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:25.750
Third one was as it should be only “Nirvichar
Samadhi” but it was not so it should be

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:31.230
“Nirvikalapa Samadhi” means doubtless
awareness they would have and enlightened

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.889
mind still with doubts.

00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:41.179
And then the fourth one they used to say as
enlightened mind which has no doubts of any

00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:42.179
kinds.

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:46.019
Which is beyond (*UNCLEAR) but with all these
four stages you get different powers within

00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:52.809
yourself by which you start manisfesting the
power of raising the kundalini also.

00:27:52.809 --> 00:28:00.679
Now, this is the thing one has to understand
that, some people move slowly.

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:04.389
Some people move just like a jet.

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:09.210
Some people move slowly and steadily and establish
themselves.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.090
Some people move like a jet and establish
themselves.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.960
Some people move like a jet can fall down.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:23.130
Some people move slowly and steadily and go
on falling up and down, up and down, up and

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.130
down.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.200
The reason is you have many problems.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.809
Which you face after realization.

00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:30.740
One of them is your health.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:38.210
If you have physical problem that shows immediately
you start seeing the physical problem within

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.210
yourself.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:49.460
You start curing yourself and once the physical
problem is handled then you want your emotional

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.780
problems should be handeled.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.429
So you come to the emotional problem.

00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:55.899
You start solving your emotional problems.

00:28:55.899 --> 00:29:01.390
Then you go to the higher thing where your
intellectual problems where the doubts start

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.809
coming in.

00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:05.909
and that is the intellectual problem you start
solving.

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:08.320
Once you solve your intellectual problems
like this.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.720
Like we had (*UNCLEAR..

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.190
Some name) first time he got his realization.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:16.100
He is an intellectual very well read man,
he knows all about it.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.450
Today that lady asked me about some (Edited
or skipped) which I never read.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.170
See I don’t read books, I don’t have time
to read book you see.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.240
I am reading human beings only.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.500
And she asked me for that book and I said
I don’t read that book and they told me

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.160
its about doom’s day (UNCLEAR) stop.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.429
Because you have read all about it.

00:29:32.429 --> 00:29:34.970
I am talking about the resurrection days.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:42.460
So, now when he got his realization he said-
“Mother, you told us that you have got telecommunication

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.490
and you can feel the other people.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.070
I haven’t had any information from my father.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.630
I want to know how he is?” I said, Alright!
Put your hands towards your father and just

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.630
think of him.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.090
And then he said there is a piercing pain
here.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.903
(Shri Mataji showing the palm of her right
hand right below the vishudhi finger and the

00:29:59.903 --> 00:30:03.700
soft area below the fingers and around the
Sahastrara of the palm) I said see, these

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.700
are the centers of your father.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:10.519
And this finger (Vishudhi) if it is so piercing
then he must be down with bad bronchitis.

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:12.480
So he said, Really?

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480
I said yes.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.769
I said, Alright! You telephone to your father
and find out.

00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:20.679
He telephoned, his mother came on the phone
and she said exactly the same sentence.

00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:24.779
“Your father is down with very bad bronchitis."

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:26.780
So, he was amazed.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.840
Andbut then he was convinced and that’s
how he saw gradually it works.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840
It’s fantastic.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.840
But it does happen.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.450
So the doubt starting disappearing.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:41.539
So then he rose to the position of doubtless
awareness.

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:44.830
But it is not a mental activity.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.090
It is a growth within you.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:52.240
When that growth takes place then you have
a great power that you can give realization

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.419
to others.

00:30:53.419 --> 00:30:58.490
With the movement of your hand, you can give
realization.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.679
You can see what’s happening to others on
your fingertips.

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:06.409
And you feel completely blissful.

00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:07.700
Absolutely at ease.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.500
At that point of peace where nothing can disturb
you.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.600
You are in your fortress.  You are just sitting
there and watching the whole world like a

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.789
drama.

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:18.730
It’s a big joke.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.840
It’s a big…you witness the whole thing
as just some sort of a play going on.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:29.440
And that is the state which comes to you which
establishes itself and you become that.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.010
Then you are no more (*UNCLEAR) or upset with
anything.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.360
As it is you are blessed.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.690
Physically, mentally, emotionally, materially
in every way.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.779
But you don’t become Mr.

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:42.389
Ford because that’s a headache.

00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:46.510
Satisfy and your problems of material wellbeing
are solved.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:53.100
Here we have somebody, who is sitting there,
who had material problems (*UNCLEAR) problems

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.549
and he came from India and was very upset.

00:31:56.549 --> 00:32:01.259
He happens to meet me, he knew me very well
otherwise as my husband was Chairman of Shipping

00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:02.259
Corporation.

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:05.470
He (*) he didn’t know that I was also this.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.349
See you have a double life.

00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:11.580
So he just met me and I told him that you
have a problem with financial things.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.969
He said, yes, how do you know?

00:32:12.969 --> 00:32:17.370
I said, I know because your center is catching
on the right hand side and if Nabhi center

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:24.159
is catching on the right hand side and left
side definitely you must have material problems.

00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:25.290
He said, that’s true.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:26.500
I said alright.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.669
I gave him realization.

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:34.750
I  just checked his Nabhi Chakra and you
will be amazed to know that he started doing

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.750
very well.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.750
Now he is a happy man.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.029
He is a satisfied man.

00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:39.171
He has got his family here.

00:32:39.171 --> 00:32:41.330
He is a very happy person.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.629
It works out.

00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:47.780
So this works out in many ways and that’s
how you start understanding it is in doubtless

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.780
awareness.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:55.600
For this in “Hatha Yoga” of “Patanjali”
is called as “Ritambhara Pragya”.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.360
Ritam- bhara-Pragya.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:05.750
Ritambhara Pragya means the knowledge of that
power of Mother Earth which fills it up with

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.470
all the seasons.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:12.320
You’ll be amazed how you will be helped.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.750
You will be so much surprised, how things
work out.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.279
You don’t have to worry about anything.

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:22.950
Everything works out so smoothly that you
are, as if there is a red carpet for you and

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.060
you are going on a magical carpet somewhere.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.649
All kinds of problems get solved.

00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:32.740
And you are amazed as you are on top of all
these things and you can help others also.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:38.009
The person who is a Sahaja yogi of a high
value if he enters in a house it becomes auspicious.

00:33:38.009 --> 00:33:41.570
The person get all the blessings of the auspiciousness.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:47.629
I have seen people who have reported to me
that such and such person came to our house

00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:53.260
and since that day Mother, my wife got cured,
my son got cured, everything became so much

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.260
better.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.260
We are much better people.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:02.549
We had lost all the money in the business
but we are doing very well now.

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:03.889
So many people write to me.

00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:09.860
Recently I received a letter, there is a lady
who is a widow and somebody wrote to me, a

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.820
wife of a gentleman called MR.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:19.740
Dalvi that Mother, your daughter such and
such has cured my husband of his cancer.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.400
He was about to die, he had galloping cancer
and now I am a lucky woman to have my husband

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.860
back at home.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.880
So these things happen.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.890
So many such things can happen because you
are a powerful thing.

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:35.710
You must have, just have the power to feel
yourself.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:36.710
That’s all.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.420
If it works, it works.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:43.550
If it does not work I can not help it but
gradually it can be helped.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.430
That’s why you have to come to the center.

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:47.950
Because it’s a collective work.

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:51.010
Now the time has come for us to work it out
collectively.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.750
You cannot just sit at home.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.350
Oh! I have got Mother’s photograph, everything
is alright.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.350
No.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.350
you all have to meet together.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.910
Understand each other’s difficulty.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.700
It works much better.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:06.540
Supposing one person has a strong say, Nabhi
Chakra another one has got a Heart Chakra

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.450
so when they meet, they supply the energy
which is needed by integration.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:12.590
And that is what has to happen.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.980
At the last center, you have all the seven
centers placed here (Shri Mataji pointing

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.840
towards her head to show the chakras.) all
the seven centers.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.690
(TIME: 35:16) and when the kundalini rises
in that area (Sahastrara) then all the integration

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:25.450
of these seven centers takes place.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.600
That’s how become an integrated personality.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.690
Whatever you do, you do it sincerely.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:37.550
You do not have a mind somewhere, you don’t
want to do it but you have to do it because

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.760
rationally it is good.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.040
It will fetch more money.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.860
Nothing of the kind you do it because it is
absolute.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:47.980
Because you think that is the thing you have
to do.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.840
And that’s how you get the courage.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:55.020
To stand up against all non-sense that talks
of disintegration.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.140
Talks of hatred.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:05.590
Talks of wars and you become such a powerful
personality that all those who come in contact

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.320
with you also have that peace within themselves.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.720
They feel that peace and they also rise to
that.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:16.770
We have to have so many people like that on
this earth to change this world.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.400
And I am sure one day will come where it will
work out.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:29.350
Television is discovered only for Sahaja Yoga
because on television if they allowed me to

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:33.180
ask you to put your hands towards me, I could
have given you realization then.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:39.000
Possibly! So this, what you call…a camera.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.820
Is also for Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.610
There are many photographs of mine which you
will see, is amazing.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:47.350
See I was sitting in a school.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:53.030
In a village school, just an ordinary school.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.820
Outside, in a very small little school and
talking to people.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:01.150
Suddenly the rays of light started coming
on me.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.330
Off course, I told them (Editted/missing*)
a great saint had lived.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.840
Seven times, the light came on me.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.030
I knew that.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.610
Nobody knew that there was light coming on
me but then I put my hand like that and said

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.240
“Bas! (means enough/stop in hindi) that’s
all.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.840
I laughed and said, No “bas! That’s it”.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.890
Alright! And at that time it stopped.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.090
But some lady was taking photographs.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.130
She took seven photographs of all those seven
poses.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:26.130
One of them is here.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.650
That one is not here where I stopped it also.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.780
It’s a very nice photograph of mine.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.550
So this camera is doing so much justice to
Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.440
It is catching all that you cannot see.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.260
And that is why, I would say that all modern
science is for this communication.  To the

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:47.560
whole world the message that you all have
to become the spirit.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.110
That is the achievement that we have to have.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:55.530
Otherwise all the rest of it is absolutely
useless.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.410
Absolutely useless.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.330
And when today that Indian gentleman told
me that Indians will never for God because

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:06.320
they are only interested in money when they
come here and rest of them won’t come to

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.700
you because you have to ask them to pay some
money for you.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.620
I was really very much disappointed and I
said, is this the level of human beings?

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.890
I don’t think it is so.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:19.710
Hope so, it is not so that people just don’t
care for money.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:20.780
Money is nothing.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.780
What is it?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.950
It is just the dust of the feet of the Lord.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:24.950
It is nothing.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:25.950
It is nothing important.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.950
But by telling all these things it does not
work out.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:33.590
Once you get your realization automatically
you will become so detached about money.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.150
Though living in the same.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:40.320
I live now, like a….because I am married
to a man who is in a big position.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.610
I live according to what he has rewards me
to live in that position.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.290
But from inside, I am absolutely detached.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.330
In the same way, it will happen to you.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:53.760
You won’t be involved with (it*UNCLEAR)
only thing- the matter has one value that

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.200
you can give it to others.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.490
That you can express your love for others.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:58.850
Today I was shopping.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:03.390
Buying presents for friends, and things for
sahaja yogis where the children are.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.410
What to give them.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.540
That’s a big attraction for me that we should
buy some present for them.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.470
And this is the thing one has to achieve.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:17.050
There is nothing else out of this matter that
you can except for this joy of (*UNCLEAR)

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.050
that you give somethings.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:22.830
In the same way, people give to God also like
they will give a flower.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.800
Flower is the best thing you can give.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.040
But when you started talking off money I don’t
know what to do.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.110
I feel like vomiting.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:35.370
My stomach goes into funny condition I just
don’t know how to tell you that it is an

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:40.260
insult to think in the term of human beings
of God.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.520
God doesn’t understand money at all.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.430
Not at all! So please try to understand that
even if you are not paying money, doesn’t

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.430
matter.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.040
It’s your right to have your realization.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.640
This is the greatest wealth you have.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.710
Today you have your realization or yesterday
you must have had.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.570
You must see to it, persue it, be serious
about it.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.240
We should not be shallow people.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:06.540
We should not be shallow at all that today
you receive your realization and tomorrow

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.561
you forget about it and you do nothing about
it.

00:40:08.561 --> 00:40:10.210
it will worse thing.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.510
Because when the seed is sprouted it has to
become the tree otherwise it is absolutely

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.510
ruined.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:21.390
It is important that when you get your realization,
you look after yourself.  Go deeper into

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.390
it.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.740
you can meet here we have a center.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.150
I am leaving some people here for you to talk
to.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.290
Who are very senior people they’ll tell
all about Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.910
About yourself, about your problems.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.370
May God Bless you.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.960
As Gavin has told you today that I have to
go today because tomorrow they have fixed

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.850
a program at 7 o’clock in the morning in
Los Angeles.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.960
So  I am sorry, I have to leave today.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:46.930
I hope you will be able to achieve what I
have told you.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:52.980
I will just go in for a little program of
self realization.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.710
Offcourse I don’t (*UNCLEAR) if fit works
out.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.490
Nothing like it.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:03.350
if it doesn’t work out, nobody should be
disappointed about it.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:09.060
And one should be contented that it will happen
if not today, it will happen tomorrow.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.860
Yesterday so many people felt it.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.820
and also today you should feel it.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:29.570
Now, if you have any questions, you should
ask them now.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:34.490
What’s the time Nick?

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:38.680
You just put your hands towards me like this
and close your eyes.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:43.910
Just put your hands, both the hands like this
(palms open) and close your eyes.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.780
Put your hands on your lap so that you are
comfortable.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.440
First thing is you have to be comfortable.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.240
Put both the feet (*UNC:EAR) parallel.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240
Away.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.140
Little bit away from each other.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.850
Because there are problems on the left sometimes,
there are problems of the right and if they

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:01.260
are little away its easy to handle.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:08.300
Now the left side, left hand- as I told you
is the hand by which you desire.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.300
Is the hand of desire.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.200
It is the hand of desire, expressing the power
of desire.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.150
So keep the left hand straight towards me
like this that the desire is to become one

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.150
with the divine.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:22.680
Now the right hand, you have to use it to
raise your kundalini.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:31.210
First of all, you have to put your right hand
on your heart.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.450
Close your eyes.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.110
Please close your eyes.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:44.310
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
don’t feel guilty.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.790
Please don’t feel guilty.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.370
You are in the present.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:49.610
Forget the past.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.610
Forget the past.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.300
You are in the present.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.890
Just now you forget what you have done, what
wrong you have committed.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:43:06.040
Forget it! and now you have to say with full
confidence within yourself you can ask a question

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.270
to me.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:13.620
Addressing me as Mother if you like, or as
Shri Mataji.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.690
-Mother, am I the spirit?

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.360
Ask the question thrice.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:38.640
If you are an indian ask the question- “kya
main atma hoon?

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:47.770
Maa kya main atma hoon?’’ Sincerely.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:54.570
Now put this right hand, keep the left hand
as it is.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.600
Don’t open your eyes.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.050
Put the right hand on the stomach on left
hand side.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:02.970
This is the center of the primordial master.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:06.570
And your principle of mastery has to be awakened.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:16.410
We call it as “Guru Tattwa” now, put your
hand there and press it hard.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:25.010
At this point- you have to assert because
if you are the spirit, you are your own master.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.570
So please say-

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.220
-Mother, I am my own master.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.450
Say it ten times.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:36.470
With full confidence.  Don’t feel guilty
while saying that.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.470
You are.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.470
You are the spirit.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.470
Sprit is quite intact.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.930
(it * UNCLEAR) its never ruined.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:46.760
it never does any harm its there, all intact.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.900
Just say- Mother, I am my own guru.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:45:00.590
I am my own master.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:05.970
Please say it ten times.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:13.990
Because this center has got ten petals.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:19.580
Now raise the right hand on heart again.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.640
Press it a little bit.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:28.350
At this point, you have to assert now twelve
times.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:39.110
Saying that Mother- I am (*UNCLEAR) , I am
the spirit.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:40.110
Which you are.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.110
No doubt.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:49.870
You have to just asset it.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:46:07.750
Now, raise this hand higher, at the base of
your neck on the left hand side.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:08.750
On the shoulder.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:09.750
Don’t open your eyes please.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:13.980
At this point, you have to say- Mother- I
am not guilty.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.950
Please say it sixteen times.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.930
Push it on the shoulder.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:28.710
Raise it higher, push it on the shoulder.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:37.980
And hold it tight at the base of your neck.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:47:09.610
Mother, I am not guilty.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:21.770
Now raise your right hand higher onto the
forehead.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.090
Put your palm across your forehead, across.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:32.520
At this point- you have to say- Mother, I
forgive everyone.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.760
Really say that.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:42.870
Without questioning, please say- Mother I
forgive everyone.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:48:28.210
Now only you can say without feeling guilty
that, if I have done anything wrong, please

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.650
Oh Lord! Forgive me.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:33.980
Anything wrong if I have done knowingly or
unknowingly please forgive me.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.930
For this you have to put back your hand on
the backside of your head.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.960
Please say that but don’t feel guilty.

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.550
Please don’t feel guilty.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:56.780
Without feeling guilty you have to say -if
I have done anything wrong, Oh Lord! Please

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:01.610
forgive me.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:12.280
Now put right hand on top of your head.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.280
And try to press it.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.280
and move it clockwise a little bit.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:19.080
On top of your head, where you had soft bone
in your childhood.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:25.420
Press it hard.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.600
At this point I cannot cross your freedom.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.140
So you have to say that you want your realization.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.760
You just say- Mother I want my realization.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:40.680
Please give me my realization.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:48.790
Say it seven times.

00:49:48.790 --> 00:50:11.110
Now raise your hand and see if there is cool
breeze coming out.

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:23.270
You can change over and see on top of your
head, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.940
Put your right hand towards me as you have
put the left hand.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.080
Right hand towards me now and put your left
hand up and see.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080
It’s there.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.080
(Mother smiling) see it’s there.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.080
Change over.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.080
You can change over.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.080
Put your right.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:51:12.570
(Shri Mataji blows air into the mic a few
times) now again you can change hand and you

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:48.660
can see it is there.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:52:32.430
(Shri Mataji takes some water from the cup
near her and rub it on her Sahastrara and

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:34.490
a little bit at the back on right nabhi) after
a break of few moments….

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:45.400
Now, you open your eyes, I will teach you
how to raise your own kundalini.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:52.190
Can you hold it for me?

00:52:52.190 --> 00:53:05.920
(Shri Mataji asks someone to hold the mic)
this hand, the left hand you have to put it

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.920
in front of you just like this before the
kundalini.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.380
Just like this.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:11.910
You can do it at home also.

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:15.250
This is your own hand and your own kundalini.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.810
This is the hand.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:21.690
Now the right hand, you have to move it up,
forward, down, backwards.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:24.400
Like this in a clockwise manner.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.670
Now let’s start, moving it.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:30.750
one hand is moving up and another is going
round like this manner.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:31.720
Take it up.
