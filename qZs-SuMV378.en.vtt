00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Based on and inspired by the teachings
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, this series

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.574
aims to explore the evolutionary relationship
between two interconnected domains

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.844
expressing human awareness
at the gross and subtle levels.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.115
It endeavors to elucidate this complex interplay
between the current scientific understanding

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.919
of human neuroanatomy; the autonomic
nervous system in particular,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.923
and the so-called subtle system as described
in the traditional literature on yoga.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.961
Ultimately, the series tries to bring its viewers
along this exploratory journey

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.500
to experience these relationships through meditation
as taught by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.400
Today, we are diving into
the fascinating intersection

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.440
of neuroscience and spirituality,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.040
exploring how the human nervous system,
the autonomic nervous system,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.360
and the brain's unique organization
relate to our spiritual experiences.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.080
Join us as we unravel the
mysteries of consciousness,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.240
evolution's role in shaping the brain,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.920
and the profound insights from ancient texts
like the Bhagavad Gita.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.160
Did you ever wonder how
our brains perceive spirituality?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.880
Or how ancient texts might align
with modern neuroscience?

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.600
Get ready for a mind-expanding conversation
that will challenge your understanding

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.520
of the human experience.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.320
Let's start to uncover these and more
intriguing questions with Dr. Ashish Pradhan.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.960
Dr. Pradhan is a distinguished medical leader
who has led cutting-edge work

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.080
in neurology and cardiovascular medicine.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.680
And his career is a testament
to strategic leadership

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.440
and a deep commitment to patient-centric care.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.160
With a distinguished career spanning pivotal roles

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.880
in drug development at multiple
global pharma R&amp;D organizations,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.080
Dr. Pradhan has pioneered
groundbreaking initiatives

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.280
that redefine patient care and medical strategy.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.080
And throughout his career,
Dr. Pradhan has led

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.720
even greater innovative initiatives

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.680
that bridge scientific advancements
with holistic patient care,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.880
earning him accolades for his pragmatic approach
and global impact.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.960
And in addition to this professional excellence,
he is a longstanding meditation practitioner,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.880
coach, and mentor.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.880
Ashish was introduced to Sahaja Yoga
as a meditation practice

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.680
at a very young age in Mumbai, India.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.640
And having experienced its profound benefits,
both personally and professionally,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
Ashish has been a passionate advocate
as well as an instructor

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.200
of the Sahaja meditation technique.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.400
Over the past decades, he has led seminars
and workshops for introducing this meditation

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.480
in multiple countries.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.360
And the experiences he has gleaned
through these years of global interactivity

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.320
have allowed him time to reflect
on how best to introduce this meditation

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.240
to culturally-diverse audiences
through the unifying language

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.280
of modern science.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.360
Welcome, Dr. Ashish, and it's such a pleasure
to have you join us.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.600
Thank you, Monikaji.
Thanks for having me.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.280
Let's start by talking to our audiences
a little bit about your meditation journey

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.480
and the founder of this meditation.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.040
Sahaja was established
by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.960
as Sahaja Yoga in India.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.480
It's also recognized as Sahaja Yoga Meditation
or Sahaja Meditation around the world

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.960
in 1970 in India.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.960
And it is a very simple,
straightforward meditation technique

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:08.160
which, at its very core relies
or is defined by the awakening

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.800
of a dormant energy that
lies within each one of us

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.000
in the sacrum bone.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.760
And as we go into this series,
we will talk a lot about

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.280
how the whole anatomical features
relate to spirituality.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.040
But the awakening of this energy
and its ascent through the energy centers

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:37.840
that lie above it, and its ultimate manifestation
through the seventh energy center by piercing it,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.000
so-called in spiritual terms,
is what meditation is truly about.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.200
But in fact, beyond that,
it's what is called a yogic state.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.960
So, this was something
that Shri Mataji started in 1970.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.880
It is now practiced in over
110-120 countries around the world.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.800
At a very young age, my father took
to this form of meditation practice,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.360
and that's how I took to it as well.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.000
And I was pretty young,
about ten years old.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.280
And thereafter, I have been a regular practitioner
of this form of meditation.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.880
So, Dr. Pradhan, before we embark on exploring
the spiritual aspects of being human,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.280
why is it crucial to first understand
the complexities of our nervous system?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.120
And how does this understanding
lay a foundation for our spiritual journey?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.200
Excellent questions.
So, the journey begins

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.400
with what it means to be human.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.680
So, when we say we are human beings,
that is, we are Homo sapiens,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.800
we are defined by a set of
biological characteristics,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.880
a set of genomic characteristics,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.400
the way the genetic code
defines us as humans.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.960
So, for example, as everybody knows now
in the twenty-first century,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.400
we have 46 chromosomes within us.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.680
So, those are both autosomes
as well as sex chromosomes.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.680
And that is what makes us human.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.560
The human genome project
unraveled the entire genetic sequence.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.640
Meaning, the chemistry of it could be written out.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.560
And if you read that, it can also be seen
as just a set of alphabets

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.800
of about six billion base pairs
of how the genetic code is written.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.280
But that could be done for every living organism
that exists on the planet.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.520
So, we have a particular genetic code
that is unique to us.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.680
Does that make us human?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.120
So, what makes us human is not the common chemistry
that binds us;

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.920
it's the same as in jellyfish,
it's the same as in fish,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.200
it's the same as in mammals,
in vertebrates, in reptiles.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.520
Every living organism has a genetic code.
Does that make them human?

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.440
Well, what makes us human
is a very unique capacity

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.480
that, so far at least, we
believe is very unique to us

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.160
as a species.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:26.160
And that is the ability to differentiate
between what is self and non-self.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.280
And that defines us as a human being.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.120
It intersects science,
philosophy, and religion.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.640
It is at this crucial intersection
where we begin to define ourselves as humans.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.120
And therefore, at the very outset,
as we begin this journey,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:52.800
it is imperative that we realize,
that we recognize, what it means to be human.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.960
And within that construct
of what it means to be human

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:06.960
is this, somewhere within us,
almost a hard-wired system

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:14.960
that allows us to be able to differentiate
between us as me, for example, I,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.200
the sense of I-ness versus non-I-ness.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.600
Every human being says, "This is my body,
this is my person, this is me."

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.040
So, who is this "me"?
What gives a human being the awareness

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.680
to say, "This is I," versus somebody else?

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.160
Do elephants do it? Do lions do it?
Do tigers do it? Do salmon fish do it?

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.560
Does a condor flying in the air do it?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.640
We, so far, do not know,
but it is assumed, based on a number of experiments

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.400
that have been conducted,
that the closest it comes to

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.280
are the great apes, the orangutans,
the chimpanzees,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.040
who can have this understanding
between self and non-self.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:12.720
And that, in essence, is the critical starting point
to understand human spirituality and its origins.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.440
So, Dr. Pradhan, evolution
has sculpted our brains over the millennia,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.200
something that you were already
just touching upon.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.640
Could you paint a vivid picture
of this evolutionary journey,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.000
highlighting any fascinating adaptations
that have shaped our brain structure and function

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.800
into the marvel that it is today?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.800
I am going to expand on that question,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.760
take a little bit of time to explain.
It is a critical question.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.920
So, let us start off
at the very beginning.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.560
So, life as we know originated
as single-cellular organisms in water.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.920
As the planet was formed
after the Big Bang,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.440
it started cooling, the gases cooled down,
the crust was formed, the oceans were formed,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.960
the elements came together,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.680
and as the planet cooled
down, at some point in time,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.480
this unique chemistry came together
of carbon-based elements

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.440
and formed what we call life.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.800
So, it started off as unicellular organisms
that, over billions of years, matured,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.760
grew first into plankton,
then small fish, then bigger fish.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.240
Gradually, they came up on land,
became amphibians;

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.360
then we had one of them: reptiles.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.960
Mammals are a subgroup of vertebrates characterised by a spine

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.280
that is, one with the vertebral column: mammals,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.960
and then, of course, us, as part
of the mammalian species.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.840
If we take a look at some
of the most primitive life forms,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.680
what they exactly are is a single cell
or a multicellular organism

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.520
that indulges in the most basic of functions.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:07.120
It eats, it consumes nutrients,
it somehow survives, it reproduces,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.400
and comes to an end
at some point in time,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.320
and the cycle repeats itself.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.400
So, if you look at the
structure of these organisms,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.880
what we see are rudiments

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.160
of what we call the nervous system.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.360
The nervous system is a system

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:36.240
that allows electrophysiological
currents to be generated.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.960
If you think of what a nervous system is,
think of it as electric currents

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.440
that are generated.
These are voltage changes that happen

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.680
across cell membranes.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.400
So, like, if you take a
voltmeter and put it across,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.160
you can see the changes
that happen across a membrane,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.320
and it is called a transmembrane potential.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.240
So, why is this important?
It seems to go a little deeper

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.800
into the question you are
asking, but this is important,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.120
because life, literally, is electricity.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.600
Life, literally, is defined by the presence
of an electric charge.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.960
So, for example, (and I will get back
to the question you are answering),

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.640
but this is again important.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.520
For example, when life comes to an end,
even particularly in human beings,

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.760
we say it is not just when the heart stops,
but it is when the brain stops.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.400
It is called brain death.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.440
So, when that electrical activity that exists,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.480
not just within the heart
that causes the heart to pump,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.360
but also the brain waves,
they come to an end.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.800
And the reason these brain
waves are actually formed

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.240
is because of the movement of
sodium and potassium

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.840
across membranes.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.760
So, back to what we're discussing.
If you look at the most primitive forms of life,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.840
they do not have
a well-developed nervous system.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:08.160
They just seem to have these minor,
sort of, threads of electrical impulses

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.320
that are just like a small network
that keeps on popping up.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.200
And that is how we say the cell is alive.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.360
Fast forward, what we see,
if you take a look at the phylogenetic nature,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.960
if you go from fish to reptile
to basic mammal to, say, man.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.800
For example, you take a fish,
you take a serpent,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:39.360
you take a mouse, and then a human brain,
what we find is that the basic requirements

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:47.760
for maintaining vegetative functions -
breathing, locomotion - that is, movement,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.560
food or nutrition or that acquisition,
digestion, excretion, and reproduction,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.280
basic functions of life -
these are present,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.760
or started growing as evolution progressed.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:10.400
We do not know why that happened —
whether it was Darwinism, evolutionary pressures,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.360
natural selection, descent through modification,
everything that Darwin wrote

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.920
and has since been discussed and debated —
all of that somehow came together.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.000
But the nervous system started evolving.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.840
It started becoming more and more sophisticated
in terms of being able to respond

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.480
to changes in the environment.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.880
If you are a small fish,
all you are worried about is not being gobbled up

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.600
by a bigger fish.
If you are a bigger fish,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.080
all you are worried about is not being
gobbled up by an even bigger fish.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:53.040
Therefore,
imagine being a fish in an aquatic environment:

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.160
you need sensory organs,
you need to detect movement.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.840
We must be able to perceive sound and other waves

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.480
so gradually we need eyes

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:14.000
or what we call visual organs
to be able to see if a larger organism

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.840
is moving towards you.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.920
It is hypothesized that, somehow,
these evolutionary pressures,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.240
these survival needs, started creating
and putting pressure in a way

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.400
that what we call today 'the nervous system'
started evolving.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:39.280
Fast forward a few billion years,
and what we now find in the human brain

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:45.760
is a highly evolved system
which has two basic strata.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.960
The first strata is in
the paleocortex—the old brain —

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.960
which takes care
of the vegetative functions,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.520
the fear or the fight response,

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.520
the basic kind of response;
and above that

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.880
is what we are going to be
talking about the most, probably,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.520
which is the cerebral cortex.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.920
It is the cerebral cortex
which is the most magnificent

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.160
creation of evolution

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.960
from a neurological perspective,
and that is critical to know,

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:24.240
and, hopefully, that allows us,
as we move forward in our discussion today,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.480
as the basis of where we go.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.680
I would like to ask, doctor,
that in the Bhagavad Gita

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:36.080
there is a striking metaphor of a tree
growing upside down with the roots in the brain.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.960
Now, could you delve into
the depths of this metaphor

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.800
through the lens of neuroscience,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.880
illuminating its profound implications
for our understanding of the mind?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.280
The Lord Shri Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita,
in the fifteenth chapter,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.480
describes a tree
which is upside down,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:05.200
and the stanza that describes it says
there exists a tree with its roots in the brain,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:11.760
and its branches that grow downward,
and its leaves are like the Vedas,

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.600
and the one who knows or
has knowledge of this tree

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.040
is a master of the Vedas.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.400
Now, the Vedas, as you know, are considered
probably the most ancient scriptures

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.360
that delve into philosophy
but, most importantly, spirituality.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.800
So, what does this mean?
How does this apply?

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:39.280
Probably a more succinct explanation
of the nervous system does not exist

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.880
in as few words as has been described
in the Bhagavad Gita.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.240
How does this correlate?

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.720
The brain, which exists up here,
is called the central nervous system,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.280
the brain and the spinal cord.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.640
It is made up of literally
billions and billions

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.040
of its functional unit,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.440
its basic functional unit called the neurons.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.400
The neurons have a cell body,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.920
and they have a long tail
which is called an axon,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.320
and these axons, they come
down and they pass through,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.040
constituting our spinal cord as well;

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.480
then they come out

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.840
of the vertebral column as
well as from parts of the brain,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.640
called the cranial nerves
or the spinal nerves,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.480
and they innervate the entire human body.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.240
So, literally, if you think about it
in metaphorical terms, you have a tree;

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.680
the animation will make this very clear.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.800
The tree which has its roots in the brain,
the branches as they get out,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.680
and they circulate and they
are spread across the body,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.040
and they innervate even the smallest sort

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.680
of the final tips of our fingers
and every part of our body,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:09.760
and that is what is referred to by Shri Krishna
in the Bhagavad Gita as the leaves;

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.320
and why it is important
for us to understand,

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.480
when it is said that the knowledge of this
is the knowledge of the Vedas,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:33.680
is that because this anatomical infrastructure
provides the substrate through which we can gain

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:43.040
a realization or an understanding of reality
that goes beyond the interpretation

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:50.040
of either our mind or of our conditionings,
and that is true knowledge; it is true 'Vida.'

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.880
'Vida' means knowledge, as the founder
of Sahaja has always said,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:05.200
and the knowledge of this tree
is only gained through self-awareness.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.840
That energy that is present within us,
when that energy is awakened,

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.760
we realize the true nature of this tree,
its branches, that is, the nerves,

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.160
and the so-called leaves.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.320
So, as the founder of Sahaja,
Shri Mataji, has expressed,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.120
and She said to me also, a number of times,
in the privileged conversation that we had,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.360
that Sahaj, essentially, is a function
of our nervous system.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:38.800
Human spirituality is not predicated,
is not dependent on our cardiovascular system,

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.880
our digestive system, our endocrine system. No.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.240
Human spirituality and its experience
is a function of our nervous system,

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.800
and that is exactly where Shri Krishna was going
when He explained that in that very short stanza

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.560
in the Bhagavad Gita.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.360
This is so interesting,
and I am sure so many of us

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.920
have not had a chance to get to that kind

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.400
of interpretation, and thanks so much
for explaining that to us.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.280
Could you shed light on the intriguing connections
between our physical nervous system

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.960
and the abstract notion of
a spiritual subtle system,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.520
and how might our neural processes

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.640
relate to a deeper spiritual experience?

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:28.000
So, let's start off with the gross anatomy
and the physiology of the nervous system,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.920
a quick primer, and then we will move towards
the subtler aspect of it

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.880
and how they correlate.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.120
So, as we discussed in the previous question,
the human nervous system comprises

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.000
the central nervous system, that's the brain,
the spinal cord and then you have

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.440
the peripheral nervous system as well,
which are these nerves,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.640
and a part of that is
the autonomic nervous system.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.840
So, a lot of what we will discuss moving forward,
and in the subsequent episodes,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.840
will relate to this critical function,
which is the autonomic nervous system.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.560
So, let's take a moment to sort of understand
what is what.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.840
The brain and the spinal cord,
which is the central nervous system,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.640
relates to both, as we discussed earlier,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:23.280
vegetative functions as well
as our volitional functions:

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.267
thinking, creativity, planning, etc.

00:22:26.267 --> 00:22:32.240
All are functions of this beautiful thing
we call the cerebral cortex.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:39.360
Besides that, we have locomotion,
that is, movement, and I am sitting here right now,

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.040
I know where my joints are,
I know where my legs are,

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.960
my eyes are looking and perceiving reality
as we see around us.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.120
A critical part of understanding this,
and I am going to take a couple of minutes

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.400
to explain this because this is important.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:04.000
Reality, as a human being perceives it—
and this is absolutely fascinating—

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.120
reality, as every human perceives it,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:16.240
is an interpretation of the brain.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:24.240
It takes a while for this to sink in,
because the brain itself is completely covered

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.120
within the cranium.
It does not interact with the outside world.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.480
The eyes receive impulses through the environment.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.720
The ears get sound waves, and they create impulses—
again, electrical impulses.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.760
Both from the eyes and the ears,
as well as from the environment around,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.200
sensory receptors that exist within the skin
and the rest of the body

00:23:51.200 --> 00:24:00.880
are all brought up into the brain,
and it is the brain that interprets those signals.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:07.200
For example, I am looking at a camera
as this is being recorded.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:12.800
My eyes are seeing it, I am hearing myself,
I am speaking in the English language.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:20.320
There are literally millions of processes
that are going on in this place right now.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.120
Because I was born in an era
and grew up in an era

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.040
where I know that this
machine that I am looking at,

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.280
and looking at you,

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.240
is called a camera.
I know the word for it.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.960
I know what it does.
I know it is a recording device.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:42.160
It will record an image.
It will record my voice.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.560
But imagine if I came from an era,
just a few hundred years ago,

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.080
when I did not know what a camera was.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.000
My eyes would still be able to see it,
but not recognize it.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.560
So, with the same exact object,
based on my prior understanding of it,

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.920
my reality changes.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.920
So, it is still a camera.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.640
It will still do exactly
what it is designed to do.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:19.040
But because I don't have an understanding of it,
my reality of it changes, of how I see it.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.000
I am speaking in English; if somebody doesn't
understand English, they will say,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
"What is he talking about?"

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.600
If somebody speaks in a
language that I don't understand

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.840
and says the exact same things I am saying,

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.120
I don't understand it because
I don't have knowledge

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.360
of the language that that person is speaking in.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.480
And this is very important.
This is very, very important to understand

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.480
before we get into spirituality.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.040
Because reality, again, is
what we perceive it to be.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.200
And there is a ton of literature about spirituality
that says that the world we see around us

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.600
is really an illusion.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.120
Now, of course, the literalist,
and from the scientific point of view,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.680
that is nonsense.
Black is black, white is white,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.240
red is red, blue is blue, green is green. Why?

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:13.920
Because the eye can perceive the wavelengths
of visible light based on the spectrum.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.800
So, whether you know green is green or not,
you may not know the word,

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.400
but ten people, unless they have visual impairment,
are going to see green as green and red as red.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.640
So, within that framework, reality is the same.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:34.960
But where it changes, where it starts becoming
somewhat different, is when we talk about things

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.760
just as I gave an example of the camera.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.760
All of this is important. Why?

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.320
Because that just tells us,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.880
I took some time to explain it.
So, my apologies if this was a bit long-winded.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.400
But it is important to realize
because reality, as a human being perceives it,

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.040
depends on his or her prior conditionings

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.880
and their understanding and
their background knowledge.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.480
If I were to be shown a picture
that hangs in the Louvre

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.320
of a lady with a very mysterious smile,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.200
considered to be the most
famous painting in the world,

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.720
perhaps I would recognize it as the Mona Lisa.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.640
But imagine somebody who has
never heard of Mona Lisa,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.480
who has never heard of Da Vinci,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:26.560
sees that painting and may not recognize it,
because he or she might appreciate the beauty.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.000
This is not to take away from
the aesthetic sense of the individual,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.560
but he may not recognize it as the Mona Lisa,
the perhaps most famous painting in the world.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.400
All of this is important. Why?
Because the world we inhabit,

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:50.240
from the time we are born to the time we die,
depends on how our brain has been programmed.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.960
Now, let's move to the essence of your question.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:03.280
Spirituality is not dependent on, or seeks to elevate
an individual above, their conditionings,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.720
above their state of knowledge,
above whatever their educational status

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.120
may have taught them or not.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.160
Whatever their socio-economic conditionings
may have brought upon them.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.760
Whatever their cultural upbringing
may have induced upon them.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:30.160
We are all products of our culture, our societies,
our beliefs, our educational status,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:38.640
our economic status.
Spiritual reality is completely above it all.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.000
So, to come back to that example,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.680
why is spirituality different,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.400
or how is it correlated?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:55.120
There exists within us a subtle system
that is very different and is universal.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.520
Just as the human brain and the spinal cord

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.880
and the nerves and the peripheral
nervous system is universal,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.720
the subtle system, so-called,
which is the spiritual system,

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.080
is very different,

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:13.040
and it has some anatomical correlates
with the gross nervous system.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.480
So, like we have the autonomic nervous system,
which has a sympathetic component

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.520
and a parasympathetic component,
likewise, we have within us a subtle system

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:30.800
that has the so-called energy channels,
energy centers, and a way in which a human being,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.720
any human being on the
planet, can experience reality

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:42.640
completely agnostic of their
cultural, philosophical,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:49.520
spiritual, educational, linguistic background.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.120
It is definitely interesting to understand
how spirituality expands an individual

00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:01.200
in different ways that you have explained,
and I am sure, along the course of this series,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.800
we will get to hear more from you

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.600
about that subtle system
that you were talking about.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.400
If you could paint us a picture
of the human nervous system,

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:15.520
revealing its intricate functions
and the fascinating structure,

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.280
and as we zoom out, how does
the autonomic nervous system

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.720
fit into this grand neural tapestry,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.680
orchestrating our bodies' responses
beyond conscious control?

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.040
So, the autonomic nervous
system, so-called autonomic,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.800
has its own volitional system.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.000
How does this happen?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.040
If I start exercising,
my heart rate will go up.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.440
Why? Because my muscles will need more oxygen;
oxygen is carried by blood;

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.000
blood needs to be pumped out at a much faster pace
and much greater force.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.400
So, the adrenaline
will start being pumped out,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.720
and it will constrict my blood vessels,
and it will also increase the contractile force

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.720
of my heart, which will increase
the pressure within the system,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.040
and voila, I get more oxygen
because I get more blood.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.320
Likewise breathing, likewise digestion;
we don't control these processes.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.040
When I eat something, I don't
have to tell my stomach

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.320
to go ahead and digest it.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.400
I don't have to tell my intestines
to go on moving the food forward.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:31.200
All of these are beyond our conscious control.
We don't have to think about it.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.600
That is the autonomic nervous system.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:41.680
The autonomic nervous system arises
from two parts in the human body.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.680
The first is in the brain,
and the other one,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.680
is in the sacrum, which is at the bottom

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.680
of the vertebral column, as
you can see in the animation.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.960
It is called the craniosacral outflow.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.760
The sympathetic nervous system,
which complements

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.920
the autonomic nervous system,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.040
also originates in the brain.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.840
Remember the original thing
that Shri Krishna spoke about,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.840
or that's in the Bhagavad Gita.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:21.120
That also starts from the brain,
and it also emerges from the spinal cord.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.560
So, the autonomic nervous
system has two components:

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.840
the parasympathetic and the sympathetic.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:34.240
These two systems function
complementary to each other.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.720
They do not antagonize each other,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.920
but they complement each other.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:47.360
For example, the sympathetic nervous system
will increase the heart rate.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.880
It will help in those kinds of actions.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.560
The parasympathetic, on the other hand,
will slow down the heart rate,

00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:00.160
and it will increase, for example, the flow
of the peristalsis, or promote peristalsis,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.480
which is the movement of food
in the gastrointestinal tract.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.880
So, the parasympathetic and the sympathetic

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.920
nervous systems function
as complements to each other.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.120
How does it all work?
In the brain, as we said, we have these

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.800
very small nerve bodies called neurons.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.920
The nerves start from there, through the axons.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.400
They come out of the brain
in the form of cranial nerves,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.160
and then they also come out from the spinal cord.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.240
These nerves branch out,

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.640
literally branch out,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.800
and they enter the various organs,
the entire organ system.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.560
So, our eyes, our
ears, our lungs, our heart,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.040
stomach, duodenum, pancreas, you name it,

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:56.240
the reproductive organs, kidneys.
All of them are innervated.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.200
Think of a tree with its branches going out,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.320
and these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny,
tiny thread-like structures.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.480
The expression
in medicine is innervation.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.200
They penetrate into these organs.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:24.800
And that is how the autonomic nervous system
controls these functions:

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.920
the heart rate, respiration,
gastrointestinal system,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.920
our endocrine system, by these
nerves that are penetrated.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.080
So, that is your hardware.
If you think in terms of hardware and software,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.560
that is the anatomical hardware.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.320
These nerves that penetrate these organs,

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.800
and based on whether they
are parasympathetic nerves

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:55.920
or whether they are sympathetic nerves,
have different neurotransmitters,

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.320
chemicals that drive the function

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.160
of those organs.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.840
So, that in essence is your
autonomic nervous system.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.280
The word is important because, again,
it is outside of volitional control,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.720
and that is a good thing because otherwise,
it would be impossible to survive

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.320
on a minute-to-minute basis.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.720
Now, a couple of quick points.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.360
What is the main function of
the autonomic nervous system?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.840
The autonomic nervous system's primary function
is to maintain milieu intérieur.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.280
It is a kind of a French expression.
What does that mean?

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:40.480
It ensures that the internal environment
in which the organism exists

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.920
is maintained in a state of balance.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.280
That word is critical; that function is vital.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.720
So, if I exercise, to go back
to the original example,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.480
my heart rate can go up,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.040
but at some point, it does need to be brought down.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.240
Because if it just keeps on
going and going and going,

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.040
at one point, my heart will fail.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:09.040
So, that's why if there is acceleration,
there has to be deceleration.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.000
If there is forward movement,
that forward movement, at some moment, has to stop,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
and it has to slow down.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Let's think in terms of, for example,
when we eat food and we have peristaltic movement,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.680
so the food goes down,
stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, etc.,

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:30.720
and then it goes into the large intestine.
All of this is maintained in this absolutely,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:37.912
impossibly complex but
completely integrated system.

00:36:37.912 --> 00:36:43.840
The two components of the autonomic nervous system
constantly talk to each other.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.240
They don't function in their own cycles,
and that's also very important

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.560
from a spiritual point of view.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:58.320
So, maintaining that internal balance
and addressing the requirements of the organism,

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:05.040
as things move along, as the environment
around that individual changes, is very important.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.800
In common parlance, if you do Google searches
or you look at YouTube videos,

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.400
the autonomic nervous system, they say,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.120
it's something that helps
you with flight or fight.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.600
If I go, if I am walking,
if I am walking in a jungle,

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.320
I see a tiger, my brain recognizes this is danger,
I need to start running,

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:26.080
my heart rate will go up because, immediately,
I need to start running, the body knows it,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.320
off I go. That's flight.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.600
But if there is a smaller danger
that I can maybe fight it,

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.240
same thing, flight or fight responses.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:40.880
But throughout our evolution,
through measures that we really do not understand,

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:48.000
through mechanisms that are yet to be elucidated,
this system developed within organisms,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.200
and it is present in mammals,
but it is most developed in human beings.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.360
And it is very, very, very important to know it
because the subtle system that we shall discuss

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:10.000
in the next episodes is the microcosm;
the subtle system is the microcosm

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.360
that reflects the macrocosm that, at a gross level,
is the autonomic nervous system.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.920
Thank you so much for
this very detailed explanation,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.920
and this also covers the next question

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.640
that I had for you, which was
how do the parasympathetic

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.920
and sympathetic branches
distinguish from each other,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.880
and how they interact with each other

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.960
to maintain the body's balance
and essential functions, etc.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:42.400
This brings me to the last question for today,
and the question is about the nerves.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.560
So, nerves are like the body's electrical wiring,
or at least so we heard.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.440
But how exactly do they transmit messages,

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.040
and why are they crucial for
our senses and movements?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.160
So, if you could take us
into that electrifying world

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.640
of nerves, and also at the same time,

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.600
talk to us about how our nervous system,
the autonomic nervous system, and the nerves

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.800
intertwine with the concept
of the human spiritual subtle system?

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.840
So, nerves are

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.200
like the electrical wiring.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:26.560
They are cells, and the way they function
is through impulse generation and conduction.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.040
Impulse means an electrical impulse.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.600
If you think of this, my hand,
as a membrane of the cell membrane.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.960
You have sodium and potassium.
These are two positively charged ions

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.080
that go across the cell membrane,
and when they go across the cell membrane —

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.920
so, potassium
going out, sodium coming in —

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.360
they create a change in the electrical charge

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:57.520
across the surface.
So, nerve impulse or propagation is

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.520
the traveling of this impulse along a line.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:07.840
Let's say this is the beginning of the nerve,
this is the end; the impulse is generated here,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.320
and down it goes.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.840
So, that's exactly how the
electrical charge travels.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.880
Of course, in an electrical wire,
it's different.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.400
It's actually an electrical charge,

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.000
which is very different,
from a movement of potassium and sodium ions

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.440
across membranes.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:39.680
This somehow creates awareness.
We don't know exactly how it creates it,

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.400
but we are aware, as we are aware.
It's a state that is

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:50.960
different from when we are asleep.
So, this state of awareness is important.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.120
We don't know exactly how it is created

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.880
within the brain, but that
electrical impulse generation

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.360
is what, literally, as we said before
when we answered one of the first questions,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.600
is what life is about.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:14.720
The way it functions is that
when the electrical impulse arrives at a point,

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.840
it causes the release of certain chemicals;
they are neurotransmitters.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.040
So, they could be acetylcholine,
they could be dopamine,

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:29.440
they could be serotonin in the brain
and in the rest of the organs.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.720
It could also be adrenaline.
These are neurotransmitters that then

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.800
are transferred across synapses.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:48.320
Synapses are a very, very important part
of the nervous system, particularly in the brain.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.800
So, what is a synapse? Let's take a look at it.
That also helps to answer your question.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:58.400
The nerve comes up at one end, ends there,
and then the other one begins,

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.800
and there is a little bit of a gap.
It's called the synaptic cleft.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.360
The nerve impulse comes,
releases the neurotransmitter,

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.200
it activates the other part,
and the impulse is propagated.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.200
Synapses are important. Why?
Because when we will see,

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.920
when we will take a deeper
look at the brain itself,

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.800
neurons form connections with each other.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:31.120
And these connections are critical
for the functioning of the brain.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.240
And it is hypothesized, because
nobody has nearly understood it,

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.400
because we have billions
of neurons, billions.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.360
Each one of them interlaced
and connected with other neurons.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.680
It's a collective;
it's a network.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:59.680
Because billions times ten becomes trillions,
it is said that what makes us human,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.080
at the end of the day, is
our synaptic connectivity.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.400
It is the richness of our cortex that makes it so.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.720
And that is why these nerves are so important,
because,

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.520
if you think about it
in terms of a calculus function,

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.280
like an integral.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:27.440
It's an integral function of all of these
trillions of synapses, all firing together,

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:33.920
this network that exists within us,
that constitutes consciousness.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:40.560
That's the hypothesis.
And it is what essentially distinguishes us

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.760
from other species on the planet.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:54.720
So, the nerves function
as individual components of a vastly complex,

00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:02.560
interlaced, integrated network
that ultimately not only creates life,

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.720
but makes us human.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.800
This is really interesting, and this is very useful
information, Dr. Ashish.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.720
I can't thank you enough
for this very insightful discussion today.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.360
We hope to connect with
you in our next episode

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.400
on yet another topic for a deeper understanding

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.000
of our audiences.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.240
And we would now like to take our audience
to experience the state of meditation

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.960
with a video from the founder of this meditation.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.360
And it will be easy for you to follow along.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.560
We wish you all the very best
on this meditative journey.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.880
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Dr. Ashish.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.160
Thank you, Monikaji.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:50.080
Shri Mataji: Not much is written, except that we can say
it is written, "I will appear before you

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:56.080
like tongues of flames."
These are the centers, the chakras.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:01.760
And it is also said that there is a tree of life.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:08.400
Like Shri Krishna has described in Gita
that the tree of life is upside down.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.520
The roots are in the brain,
and the branches go down in all directions.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.400
Keep your eyes closed.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.280
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.280
All the time the left hand is towards Me.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:45.600
Now, here you have to say in your heart,
with all sincerity, Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.240
Ask the question three times
in your heart.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.350
This is a very fundamental question.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:17.600
Now bring the right hand
on to the left hand side of your stomach,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.520
in the upper part.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.880
Here press it.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:31.360
Now this is the center of your mastery,
your guidance, your guru Tattva, as they say.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.760
So ask a question,
Mother, am I my own master?

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.080
This is the question to be asked
three times.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:43.911
Mother, am I my own master?

00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:03.840
Now bring your right hand down below
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:11.520
Now this is the center from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.320
all the pure work is done.

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.440
So to ask six times,
because this center has got six petals,

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:25.120
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:28.320
Six times you just ask.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.551
As a result of this asking
the Kundalini starts getting awakened.

00:47:44.431 --> 00:47:49.200
Now to help the Kundalini to rise
you have to cooperate with Her.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.360
So please put your right hand
on the left hand side

00:47:53.360 --> 00:48:02.560
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it on the stomach.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.240
Now here you have to say
with full confidence,

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:14.960
to help the Kundalini to rise,
Mother, I am my own master.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.200
This you have to say ten times.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.240
These are the ten commandments
which you have to say,

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.975
that Mother, I am my own master.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:07.760
Now, ten times with full confidence.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:17.840
Now please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:24.720
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.120
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.520
This is the truth, you are the Spirit.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:34.960
But you have to say with full confidence,
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.716
This you have to say twelve times.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:14.320
Now one has to know
that God Almighty is the ocean of love.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.200
But above all He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.040
So He forgives.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.680
Whatever wrong you do He forgives.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:31.360
So don't feel guilty
and put your right hand across

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:39.840
on the left hand side in the corner
which is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:44.000
Now here you have to say
again with full confidence,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.760
sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.040
Please say it, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.480
Sixteen times.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.843
I am not guilty at all.

00:50:57.843 --> 00:51:05.979
Please say it.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:45.520
Now raise your hand across on your forehead
and it's a very important center.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:56.320
Here you have to say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.560
Please say it from your heart.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.640
How many times is not the point.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:05.040
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.720
Now some would say
that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:14.640
But it's a myth
that we do not forgive or we forgive.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.520
We do not do anything
in both the cases.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.520
But if we don't forgive
then we play into wrong hands.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:28.508
So please say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:43.120
Now please take your hand on the back agnya,
the same center, on the back side of your head

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:48.160
and allow your head to rest on it
and push it back a little bit.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:55.520
Now here you have to say
for your satisfaction,

00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:02.000
because you always feel guilty,
that, O Divine, if I have done anything wrong,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.310
please forgive me.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:19.520
Please forgive me, from your heart.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:26.080
Stretch your hand fully
and put your center of your palm

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:34.880
on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.080
Press it hard.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.600
Press hard your scalp.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:45.840
Now you have to move it seven times
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.120
Mother, please give us My Self-realization,
because I cannot force on you.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.840
So you have to ask for it.

00:53:53.840 --> 00:54:02.400
Seven times press it hard
and move it seven times very hard.

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.694
Slowly saying that.
