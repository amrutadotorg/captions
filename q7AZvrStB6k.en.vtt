00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.040

Mahakali Trigunatmika

Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namah!

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.280
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.600
Shri Kalki Sakshat

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.040

Om Twameva Sakshat

Shri Kalki Sakshat

Jagan-mata Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai!

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.840
Beautiful place.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.640
What a beautiful place, ha? Beautiful place,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.240
under the sky.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.840
You all have a ride, is it?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.480
Nice shady place also.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.960
Hello, yes, You are playing? Did you go on the river?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.680
How can you all be sitting there, it's so muddy!

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.960
Come down Michael

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.720
Aah!

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.680
Is that a nest?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.359
No, that's a dead branch, Mother. Just a dead branch hanging down.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.280
Looks a little bit like mistletoe.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.560
Yogi: There is quite a lot of mistletoe on the trees all around here.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.760
This is the eucalyptus, you see.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.920
Hmmm!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.160
These are Gum nuts? Yes, there are the flowers and then they become nuts.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.160
The one we saw... these are the same?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.000
Yogi: The same flowers that you saw in, where was it Adelaide.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.360
The ones which are like Ganesha's flowers?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.720
Yogi Yes, yes, yes, Mother.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.640
With the four petals? Yogi: Yes, but it had a much bigger base.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.840
Let Me see. Yogi: Much fatter base.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.079
Yogi: They're all different shapes and sizes but the one we saw had-

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.440
definitely had four sections on it.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.480
No, these are those different thing which has eyes sort of thing.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.200
Is that the one?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.120
Yogi: That was a banksia nut, actually, Mother, I think

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.200
He? Y:That was a banksia nut the one that you got little naps made.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.320
That was in Perth.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.359
Which may be had got four little slices in

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.320
Yes, yes, that was another one.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.600
That was just like Ganesha.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.960
Yogi: Western Australia is famous for that flower.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.200
Great!

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.280
Yogi: In fact in the spring time after the rains

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.280
Yogi: Western Australia is just a blaze of wild flowers.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.200
It's famous all over the world for that.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.440
These are six, you see..ha... six.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.320
Yes, these are six.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.640
So, these are more Swadisthana I should say.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.000
The fragrance is different from what we get in our eucalyptus.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.120
Yogi: It's a whole, it's a whole range of fragrances.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.280
Many, there is lemon scented and peppermint and

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.560
I think the one which is that, is Indian.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.200
Can you get a leaf out of that? Let's see have a look.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.359
Yogi: I think they are bringing You a selection of leaves, Mother.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.640
Many eucalyptus here.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.680
Children are very happy

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.800
They're so full of joy, children, just look.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.039
Yogi: They've all been down in the mud, in the river.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.120
Come along. He?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.680
Look at them, look at the children.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.760
How they feel one good nature immediately.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.920
Thank you. This too has six.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.360
They are so rich, I tell you.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.960
Yogi: They make a lot of eucalyptus oil from these.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.440
Yeah. But I feel our eucalyptus is very strong, Indian way.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.840
It's smelling not so strong.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.599
It's more the chlorophyll than eucalyptus oil in it.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.200
Yogi: Some of these varieties are not so strong.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.000
Yogi: It's the same I think that one, Mother, it is not a strong one.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.080
Yogi: There are no lemon scented ones around at all?

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.239
This this one yeah, this is..

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.880
This is a willow. This is a weeping willow I think.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.200
Yogini: No, it's not weeping type of gum but has no scent at all.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.120
Yogini: The lemon scented one looks similar to that but

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.280
has beautiful smell of lemon about, (...)

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.560
Oh, this doesn't have.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.159
But it has, not that it does not - but very faint.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.560
I think on the whole India has got great quality of...

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.720
Yogi: Perfume, trees, flowers.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.360
...flower, everything, you see even chandan is grown there

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.760
and once I talked to a lady

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.400
a Japanese lady, I said I enjoy Japanese garden.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.320
She said, "But it doesn't have the perfume that You have in India."

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.079
Yes that's true.  Hm. We have trees with these Parijatakas and all.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.880
Why don't you bring next time when you come that Parijataka?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.760
Is a good idea

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.000
Very small flower, you must have seen, with a red stem.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.760
Parijataka. This time I'll show you, if it is there.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.560
We have so many scented flowers in our country.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.720
One of them is this of course.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.199
But we have another one which we call as Mogra -

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.040
It comes during summer. You can bring all these.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.680
Yogi: From India?

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.720
Yogi: Yes, they should grow here too.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.200
Yes, there's another one called Bakula. Bakula is a -

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.920
it looks like more like a wood like thing,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.800
a little, little flower is there.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.880
but it's a huge big tree and the whole place gets filled up with them

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.960
We have so many like that.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.319
If they allow you to bring - do they?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.040
Yogi: Well they don't but we could,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.560
if we use it discriminately, I think, it would be alright.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.880
We just hide it away in our bags.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.480
I mean they are not, there's no danger with them. It's just that

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.959
some people bring some dangerous seeds in and

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.080
they become pests or become a source of infection.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.280
Yogi: This is the type of trees, Mother, that are used for timber.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.560
Yogi: Very, very straight.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.880
But this is a very light, light wood, very light wood.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.120
Yogi: No, no itâ€™s a hardwood actually. Is it?

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.880
(...) Yogi: Heavy, heavy, wet hard wood.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.480
Alright, in India you don't get that hard one.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.840
Yogi: In fact it's so hard that it won't take a nail easily.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.200
Hmm, that's great!

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.160
This is another variety. What we get is just a waste, you see.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.880
Yogi: Mother would you like a coke or something?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.560
I'll have little chana first,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.640
then I'll drink a little water. Yogi: Coke?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.720
Yesterday was a good day.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.440
Yogi: You missed the great program. Hmm. Amazing.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.840
Did you hear about it? What happened?

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.839
Yogi:Yes Mother, we've been questioning people all morning about it,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.800
the events of the last few days.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.680
Tremendous! Yogi: Tremendous Mother!

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:11.400
We have got rid of the evil effect of Mr. Terence

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.360
and he's out for ever and ever.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.960
And I have to tell all of you who are leaders -

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.960
I was telling yesterday - now we have to take very mild ways.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.800
Specially the leaders have to be extremely mild.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.920
They should not be strict, they should not get angry,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.960
they should not shout.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.400
But a very patronizing way should be,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.720
because that's the way they can appeal to people.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.320
All the time getting angry or disciplining is not a good thing

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.920
and judging others as what he did and then he started on jumping.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.040
First he started judging others, correcting others then

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.080
on firmer grounds and firmer grounds

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.720
and also I think he did not allow

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.880
it to spread to other places because he wanted to control.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.720
See this is the main thing for that.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.640
Yogi: Yes, he wanted it in one place.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.280
Yogini: It's apple juice for you personally.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.760
Yogi: Even that was partly the reason why

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.720
the ashram at Morunga failed, Mother because

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.360
he basically didn't want it to be.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.239
Yes he has had a very influence on everyone, very bad influence.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.360
He had an influence, but of a very bad nature

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.280
and egoistical people

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.439
were charmed by this thing some time

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.760
and they don't try to get it off.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.040
But one must learn a lesson now,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.200
that all kinds of egos must be dropped.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.120
Now he's dropped out of Sahaja Yoga, he and his wife permanent,

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.360
they have nothing to do, nothing to do.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.560
The amount of damage he's done to Sahaja yoga, you can't imagine.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.760
So many people came in the party,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:06.680
I mean in the hall up to the, up to the dais and told Me

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.360
that because of Warren they left Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
Yogi: Because of Terence.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.719
I mean because of Terence. I still combine you with him.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.439
You see he was so much identified and

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.960
he just used My name and his name (...)

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.000
Yogi: Yes, he did, Mother.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.520
A very nasty fellow.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.240
Very rotten person, rotten to the core in the way he behaved.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.560
Did they tell you?

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.079
Very shameful to behave like that.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.360
And I too telephoned to his father-in-law

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.959
and the father-in-law told Me they are very ashamed of themselves

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.160
and this that. I said this is a permanent feature now.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.120
You do what you like and then just to say sorry. Nothing doing,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.560
now we are not going to have any more of that.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.720
And she's a liar. She's told him lots of stories, she made a big

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.440
thing out of him as if he was something special.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.880
She was a - not at all.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.520
In India she's not regarded as even a sahaja yogini.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.000
So many people don't think her to be a sahaja yogini.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.040
She was out of Sahaja yoga for five years for misbehaving!

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.600
And she thinks no end of herself.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.760
This dream and all those business you should all

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.880
forget these nonsensical things that she told you.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.200
That this is a dream we are having and dream they came and told Me..

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.439
Cary I'm rather worried because you have been

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.840
with that horrible fellow - better beat him with shoes every day.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.640
Can you go and do it now, nicely?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.320
Horrible fellow!

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.079
Actually I never thought him anything good much,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.040
but Mr. Warren was rather anxious that he should be pulled in within

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.080
and then I said that Warren is your leader.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.839
He said you should also take the name of Terence.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.200
I never thought him to be something good.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.960
But it was a nice thing that he came down

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.960
and everybody could see him he was exposed

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.800
and that's how he got into his problem.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.960
Yogi: That's just the idea Mother, that's why Hmm.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.560
I wanted him to go away. So everybody

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.880
could see it, not just Sydney ashram or Melbourne or something.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.160
Very ego-oriented.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:19.959
Has done nothing for Sahaja yoga, nothing so far.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.599
So many marriages he's broken,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.800
so many people he's talked to so rudely, isn't it?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.640
And some of them are not willing to come back

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.440
because of this.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.760
He said horrible things you know.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.960
Maybe your wife also, maybe one of them, I don't know.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.120
Just find out.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.680
Christine told Me that it is he who created a problem for her.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:20.880
Phil and Christine took to that ego behavior.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.679
Yogi: Christine mainly.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.800
He? Yogi: Christine mainly huh?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.400
Not only Christine.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.760
Yesterday Michelle's mother - Michelle's mother is here?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.080
She said that

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.440
her husband is not willing to come to Sahaja Yoga anymore

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.040
- she is there.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.520
She told Me the same thing. So many of them.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.040
He is very dangerous. He's got married by that.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.280
(...) he's got a good father-in-law whom he can lynch very well.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.960
Come along.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.960
But then I had to declare.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.360
But one lady who was there, who was a reporter,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.360
she reacted very strongly and we have to now deal with that

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.600
on Monday or Tuesday perhaps, Tuesday morning.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.320
She's coming to see Me.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.159
It's terrible!

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.040
Better now - much better.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.760
Hmm! That's it, that is him.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.160
Give him bandhan - useless fellow.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.760
I think best is to give yourself a bandhan

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.120
so that he doesn't attack you -

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.640
Some sort of a cancer I think.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.560
Yogi: Like the false gurus Mother,

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.800
it won't be easy to get them out of the brain.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.760
You should beat them with shoes.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.480
You have to put Me in your brain, first of all,

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.240
just put Me in your brain.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.360
Just say: "Mother, You are in my brain", that's all.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.080
That's the mantra.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.280
Mother,  Seven times.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.120
Just say that seven times.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.679
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.320
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.800
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.240
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.960
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.399
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.760
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.840
Hmm! Nirvichara.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.200
You've better eyes.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.280
Ha! It is working  Yogi: Yes everything has gone peaceful

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.600
Good?

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.680
So now Warren is coming with Me and who else is coming?

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.720
Yogi: Mathew's going and.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.000
Yogi: Mathew and Albert.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.720
Albert is going.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.800
So,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.520
and we are going to fix up for our next trip to India.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.440
I may not be able to come next year, I don't know

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.840
whatever is the situation because

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.480
I'm going to be rather busy building up ashrams for you

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.240
to have in India.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.880
So I don't know what will be the situation next year.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.159
But in any case you all are coming

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.320
and we are thinking of making it one month and one month.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.720
So, some people who want to come in this month

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.840
can come in first month and others in second month.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.280
And

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.960
that will reduce pressure because we'll be having more people now.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:04.040
And these trips also may come to an end, after some time.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.360
Because it's, you know it's very difficult

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.159
to manage the whole stuff with so many people going

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.640
and I think you are very much uncomfortable also.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.640
Now, huh?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.320
Yogi: What... touring with You, Mother?

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.879
We've talked about it a number of times and said that most of us

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.320
have felt that the most enjoyable part of the tour

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.879
apart from, of course, the beautiful climax in Delhi,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.600
was round Maharashtra and, You know,

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.560
we all seem to recall affectionately that

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.200
the buses and the dust and the moving

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.440
but we did miss that, Mother, when we got to Delhi.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.560
There was a great joy in meeting those people

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.600
and sharing the programs.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.360
I can take you to a dense forest this time if you want but

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.720
the thing is in one month we'll have to do Maharashtra.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.840
Three weeks it will be Maharashtra and one week will be lapping,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.240
overlapping each other- like that you know - about what - oh no,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.639
four weeks will be in Maharashtra, one week in Delhi overlapping

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.560
for about 2-3 days, if you want to get married or all sort of things.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.160
So, we can have about 3 days overlapping.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.280
Yogi: So, it will be 4 weeks tour and 1 week overlapping.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.160
Now 1 week overlap,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.760
we can't have so many people in Delhi, you see, double group.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.520
Yogi: No, seems impossible.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.840
Impossible. So what we can do: you can have a group of people

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.960
will go from here for one week in Delhi

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.200
and the others will be coming for another week in Delhi.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.800
But in between you can have 3 days,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.720
3 days which could be overlap.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.280
Only 3 days could be easier.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.760
Yogi: Maybe 1 group could stay in the temple or something like that.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.959
One group can stay in the temple for 2 nights, it's alright.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.360
Yogi: Also those that had to go home early

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.560
could always leave from Bombay again and go back.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.000
If they could only stay for 1 month. Yes, yes.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.800
Yogi: So they don't have to come to Delhi for the extra week.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.600
Yes, those who want to come to Delhi can come otherwise they need not

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.720
because Delhi will be mostly you will be staying with other people

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.320
and not with there with sahaja yogis also

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.159
Isn't it? That's a good idea

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.640
because you enjoyed it very much

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.879
Yogi: That was the best part of Delhi, Mother.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.080
After Your program that was the...

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.520
That was a thing you all enjoyed.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.240
So we'll have 100 people for the first week

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.840
and 100 people, first month and hundred for the next.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.560
Because this time it was 140 together was too much.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.840
So we'll have two.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.360
Yogi: Sahaja yoga's leaders of the world will start battling,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.520
Mother, I imagine any time now for their quota.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.879
Yogi: The only problem with all this, Mother, is

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.159
You're going to have to be in two places at once.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.760
Yeah! that I'll have to.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.640
Two months I can give for all this -

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.000
always been two months there, so we can manage with two months.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.360
But then we'll not have many programs in Bombay.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.720
And the 15 days or 15 and 3, 17 days, 18 days, I'll be in Delhi.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.720
So we can have 18 days program in Delhi.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.720
In Bombay, we can have about 3 days here and a 3 days here.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.160
That we have to adjust.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.680
Any other suggestions you have?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.120
Yogi: People could start working on the assumption that

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.720
they'll be going about what time - about Christmas time? Yes.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.120
Yogi: Before christmas Mother? Before christmas.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.480
Yogi: Just before christmas?

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.040
Easy to arrange like that.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.800
So that it will be January and February

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.560
and we are again back in March.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.719
Is she crying? Which one?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.320
Yogi: That's the other one.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.120
Yogi: Has anyone got any suggestions or anything that... Yah,

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.919
Mother is just asking any ideas that they want to

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.959
put up about the trip in India?

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.800
Don't be shy.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.800
Y: Could we make a visit to a silk mill to see how sarees are woven?

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.280
Y: Can we have a visit to a silk mill to see how sarees are woven?

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.880
For that you have to go to  Banares

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.520
to see the sarees woven.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.840
That's done in Banares, most of these silk sarees.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.520
You don't find them in Delhi or anything but ..

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.200
Yogi: One in Dhulia, we saw some in Dhulia we saw sarees being woven

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.240
Yogi: but they were cheaper ones. Yes, cheaper sarees

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:09.080
but for these special intricate ones, you see, which are whole silk,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.320
mostly you can find cotton ones being made here but not silk.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.840
But this fellow who gave you dhotis

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.159
you can go to his place and see.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.879
Yogi: If we can bring the trunk? Can you bring it over, Mother can give those things out now?[UNCLEAR]

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.760
Yogi: Get a couple of people to help you.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.640
What about the presents that Tumal has sent for you?

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.399
Yogi: They haven't arrived, 25th they'll arrive.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.959
Very sad!

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.600
Yogi: Did You see them all, Mother? Mother: Huh You saw them?

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.320
Oh, nice things!

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.960
We brought it with such love for you, just what a shame!

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.240
Really.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.200
So what about your ordering for the

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.879
juice we were saying? Juice machine or something?

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.840
Yogi: Ah, somebody is looking into it more carefully.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.360
Mr. Pai was the only one who did it in Bombay.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.040
I want somebody else who knows a little bit more about it.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:28.120
They cost about from about 1500 up to about 3000.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.439
3000 for a bigger one, which has capacity to roll about

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.679
four or five stalks at once. That's a better one.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.000
But I want to wait now until we get Queensland open because

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.720
the cane does not begin until the North coast of New South Wales.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.640
So only when we get Brisbane open should we start that project.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.920
That's a very good idea. Yogi: There's no cane down in this area.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.840
That will be, maybe a next year project now.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.080
Mother, should we start up Brisbane ourselves in the next few months

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.040
Yes, yes you should start. Is alright.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.440
Yogi: I was wondering [UNCLEAR] Albert, is he here, he might like to....?

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.760
Oh, you get lot of people from other cults coming.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.520
That would be the problem and maybe you might feel it rather

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.920
embarrassing. But take it slowly and tell them that

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.159
"see now, you have to give up your gurus. We have no quarrel nothing

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.919
but we can't work out with your gurus, so please give up."

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.800
Yogi: We could say, start gently up there and do it too

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.280
Yeah! Yogi: ...slowly..

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.720
Yogi: Have the dhoties been torn up in the two pieces?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.080
Yogi: No they haven't Yogi: We could do that.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.800
Yes. So how are we going to distribute it?

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.320
Yogi: I think they will just have to be very common sensical about it

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.560
because there are not enough for everybody.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.800
If you had told Me I would have

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.399
asked him to put some more. But how many did not get the dhoties?

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.480
Yogi: All the men that didn't get dhoties put your hands up.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.320
The ones that did not get the dhoties.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.720
Just put your hand up. Oh! it's not many, very few.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.840
Must be some of them who are cooking - just find out from them.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.120
Yogi: The three men who are cooking, they were in India, they would have had theirs

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.800
They must have had, alright.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.160
So now how many did not get? Please raise your hands.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.639
Ah, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. eight.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.280
So we have to have four dhoties.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.320
So for two persons, these are for two persons.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.600
Yogi: Come on and get them, quickly.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.400
I think they are even better, so let's give these first.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.040
They are better quality, these are better quality.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.480
For two persons, this is for two persons.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.640
Yogi: We tear it in half. Yes, exactly.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.760
Yogi: Is that two, is that two or one? Yes, two, these are two.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.320
These are all two, these are two either.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.279
These are two definitely, now so you two can share

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.360
and you two can share.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:39.319
So you need four - we have four. Now this one two can share there

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:44.560
and two can share here. Alright, let us give these first of all.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.400
Now two more - again you come back, I think, let's have it.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.239
Now one each. You two have, too, alright?

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.639
You haven't got it too? Alright.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.720
Give it back, give Me that, give it back. Other one, the other one.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.480
See. Alright!

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.359
Now you have these two

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.120
because, you see just you had. You have got two?

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.320
Alright, you have two now, let's see.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.960
We'll find out one for him. So now how many?

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.919
One - now take out one.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.680
Yogi: Has anyone who got one, lost it or [UNCLEAR]

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.920
Alright, now what I'm saying we have to give two each

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.400
in any case so you take this one.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.279
Alright, now you do one thing with - take out these - one

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:38.920
How many they are? These are also two each - two, three, four,

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.040
five.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.439
So it's, alright, now I don't know,

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.640
let Me see what's written in there, if they are two or one.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.359
What's written here?

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.560
I think it is - it is for two. Yes.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.040
So now, two of you should again come.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.200
Now he's got two so you, you come along and this set -

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.200
you should have one of that and one of that, alright?

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.200
May God bless you!

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.720
Now you come along again - you have one of that, it's two again.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:42.160
Now who else? Come along, you people come along also.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.759
One each, one of this and one of that. One more group here.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.160
Mother, would it be a good idea

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.920
if we all wore dhoties to the puja tomorrow?

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.040
Good idea, very very good idea, you wash them.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.879
Have we, have I given to all of you two each now? He hasn't got.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.920
Yes you have got. Now so

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.240
Yogi: You need another one? See, he didn't follow.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.480
Just tell him what it is. See these are to be divided into four

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.720
and one each you have to take.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.240
Yogi: Everyone should have a different one, so you take two,

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.680
one of each.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:23.600
You never got one... Alright, give it to them

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.960
Yogi: A real paddle steamer!

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.880
Y: I don't see him. Oh look Mother, coming up the river!

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.080
Y: It's a paddle steamer Mother, it's...

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.360

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.200
Same thing.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.400

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.320
Yogi: How many did not get these shawls? Quite a few

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.800
How many? No, not the ladies - gents.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.759
Not the ladies - gents. Yogi: How many men did not get the shawl?

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.279
Yogi: One - keep your hands up so we can count.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.560
Yogi: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Yogi: Let the little girls come first. [UNCLEAR] this first of all.

All of them will have the first you see. Y:Mother itâ€™s my first saree

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.640
Y:Thank you Mother, it's my first saree.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.560

Alright, come along. I think you come along, come along.

Alright, so we'll give these - not these - not that.

Come along. For the ladies.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.760
Is good, you can wrap your children also - both of them are married.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.480
Hmm! Two

This is just a blouse - you have a saree?

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.520
Now, I think, you better give her because she has a saree

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.680
- you can give her.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.319
Yogi: Joyan has a saree Mother - she's got lots of sarees.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.720
First [UNCLEAR]

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.560
Joyan can have this. Yogi: She's got lots.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.600
Joyan you can have a blouse piece.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.880
You can have blouse piece, alright.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.479
Now, this is for a little girl.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.680
Is there any little girl here? Come along.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.280
It's good, so she can make her a

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.560
petticoat of this color - good idea.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.960
Ah!

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.399
Now what is that?

That's [UNCLEAR]

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.880
That's a puja cloth. Yogi: Yeah, that was used for puja.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.520
Yogi: This was bought for puja but not used

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.960
This to be kept.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.680
Yogi: It was not used.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.600
What is it?

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.080
Y: I think Mother that's- I was just trying to work out which ...

Yes, there are small children. How many there are?

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.920
They're quite a lot.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.440
Yogis: Lots everywhere. 20 Mother. Annh?

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.840
20.................

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.640
Yogi: Loaves and fishes, Mother. Hmm.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.040
This one is - now one is left out.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.640
So, who's the gentleman who hasn't got it?

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.680
Yogi: Michael, did you get one?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.919
Yogi: Where is he?

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.560
Yogi: Did Michael get one?

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.400
Where is he? Does he want one? Yogi: He'll be back. I'll give it to him later Mother.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.600
This one I think you should keep for puja.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.360
This one for Michael.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.160
Oh! you must wash it, it's not clean. You have to wash them.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.759
Tonight you have to go and wash them for tomorrow

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.680
or you can wear the inside one may be clean

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.560
- just see the inside ones, may be clean.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.320
These are all clean ones, these are very clean - these you can use.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.880
You see, you better use these first - these are all clean ones.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.360
These are very clean.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.520
Yogi: I said they should wear the dhoties tomorrow, Mother.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.080
I should have said puja on monday

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.280
They'll all be turning up to the public program in their dhoties.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.640
It'll be very interesting.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.840
Ian has got his dhoti? Yogi: I think so.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.359
You got Ian? Your dhoti have you got?

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.759
Yogi: Yes Mother, I have got [UNCLEAR]

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.520
What's the problem?

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.000
Yogi: Ian says it's getting him into it that's the problem. Why?

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.800
Yogi: Make it a clear instruction, Mother then it's done

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.640
It's a - you don't know how to wear it - should I show you?

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:08.319
Now any man, come along. Tear off a dhoti - half.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.800
Yogi: Is there, has anybody got a pair of scissors or a sharp knife?

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.760
You see, you have to wear something short inside

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.240
- you see you can't just wear

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.240
the dhoti or you can wear a short pant will do.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.960
First let Me show how the dhoti is

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.280
Let Me do - it's, it's straightforward you can just tear it off, Yogi: stand up

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.480
Come along, let him come, I'll show you.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.520
Now, come here.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.279
Now,

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.360
hold it in double

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.560
here - make it a double around. Complete. Double it that side

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.760
Yogis: [UNCLEAR] tuck it in ........

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.279
[UNCLEAR] now

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.240
Yogi: You just

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.960
Just stand, yes do it like that, alright.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:40.359
Now, now can you see that clearly.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.839
Now stand facing that side.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.080
Now here at this point you've to pull out two things like that

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.640
like this, alright, for a knot.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:58.520
Now you have to keep a big knot like this alright

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.960
and to make it a strong knot you have to change over

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.720
and now give it a knot -

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.440
so that the knot never opens out easily.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.520
This kind of a knot is called as (.....). Imagine.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:25.600
[UNCLEAR]

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.680
Now it will not open, Alright.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.160
So, then what you have to do

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.759
you should take one side just like that.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.279
Now, if you want to wear like Shri Krishna

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.759
or if you want to wear like - depends on -

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.520
put it the whole thing out like that, come along

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.720
like this. Now turn around.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:59.799
Now, you have to push this one here. Just push one side here.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.960
One is done like this, alright

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.879
and the another side, this side is picked up

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.319
as this - this is Shri Krishna's style.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.200
Alright. And now take it in your hand like that

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.600
and you have to push the whole thing in there.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.200
So the whole thing is tucked in and you have a nice dress.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.560
Pull here and the sides like that

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.879
See this is [UNCLEAR] Now you push this [UNCLEAR]

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:32.600
[UNCLEAR]

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.640
Now, take it out

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.080
now on this side you should

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.920
the whole thing I've pushed it in, alright

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:54.240
and just push it a little bit on the sides so you don't show your legs.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.879
Yogi: That side?

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.160
You follow that?

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.560
Alright, that's too much.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.640
Did I do it very fast?

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.960
[UNCLEAR] now stand up

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.680
[UNCLEAR]

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:22.280
Some people take it too much inside with some too little. Whatever style you like

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.680
Okay tie it up.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.439
Alright, beautiful now, you have to take

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.319
careful to let it wait so when you sit down

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.759
you'll be comfortable - now sit down and see if it is comfortable.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.960
Yes, you must have something to wear

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.120
[UNCLEAR]

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.600
You sit down.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.920
Annh?

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.400
Yes, you can cross, everything. It's very comfortable.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.080
Yogi: Fix it, Mother. Just tuck one in, ah.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.280
It's the left hand-side has to be balanced.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.960
Now, can you make a small again

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.640
Now take the other one in a different way.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.280
Now the flair is made here,

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.080
the whole thing is made Yogi: The front first Yes.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.480
Starts from here.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.520
This has to go inside, you see, that's the main point.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.040
Yogi: This this loose end goes inside like that

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.920
it goes inside like that and now

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.200
you need to come [UNCLEAR]

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.759
[UNCLEAR]

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.240
pull it out there.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.120
Yes, that it is

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.560
and this is to be tucked in here, you see Yogi: Yes.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.800
Just an end of it, you see, this end.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.480
This end - yes, tuck it in here.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.280
and you can pull it a little bit

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.000
if you want through or very thin you can pull it [UNCLEAR]

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.520
Yogi: Tuck it in otherwise it would be there

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.880
Haan, see. Yogi: Thank You!

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.360
It's good. Yogi: I'll leave it on till Monday then.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.560
This is a very, ah, mobile state.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.320
You see, you can use it for bathing,

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:11.120
you can use it for a towel rail, you can use it for a curtain.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.200
You got [UNCLEAR]

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.040
Annh?

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.600
Yogi: Is the Sea puja also for rain?

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.439
Yes, of course, that's for rain only.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.360
We did for rain the Sea puja one.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.799
Now what about you people?

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.440
Yogini: Lunch is ready now.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.120
It's perfect.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.480
Yogi: Are You [UNCLEAR]? Hmm.

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.360
It's perfect. Try it.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.880
Yogi: Mother [UNCLEAR]

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.279
Put it in the[UNCLEAR]

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.040
They must have given you

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:01.120
I told them to give you that porridge in Delhi.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:13.240
What are they called as - cuckoo? ["Cucalla"]

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.320
So many birds!

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.560
Yogi: Can Stephen please come up.

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.920
You remember the[UNCLEAR] [FRUIT OR FOOD?]

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.760
who said that first time I've seen a ..... bird.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.520
Yogi: They found that most of the ornamental work for gardens,

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.600
Yogi: if not all of it, is done in concrete. In cement. Yeah!

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.600
Yogi: and they are not so very keen on working in cement

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.360
they prefer to work in plaster.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.120
No, plaster won't stay outside.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.040
in the garden, you have to use cement.

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.160
Is a very difficult work to do it with cement.

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:58.720
Now you must come in Sydney which there are

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.600
so many places done with cement - such beautiful pieces

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.800
- if you can just make the replicas of those.

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.560
First you have to buy some of these - just make a replica.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.240
Yogi: Mother...These are garden ornaments.. Are they? Mother: Yes, yes.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.880
Yogi: Mother, you were mentioning that

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.920
we could have some replica of your face

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.040
Somebody was going to do that then what happened?

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.240
Yogi: Robin is the expert

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.840
Yogi: I got everything here, Mother.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.240
Then why not do it, tonight?

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.080
Try. It is a good idea.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.320
Tonight you can try.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.960
Yogi: Can I just ask one more question, Mother, concerning the John and the plastering

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.080
Yogi: job and the plastering that is

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.840
Yogi: they're all wondering whether

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.400
perhaps it might be better to go into

00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:03.120
Y:plastering for inside things like cornices and inside moldings and

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.720
Yogi: model work for interior. Yeah.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.720
Yogi: Perhaps, from what You were saying Mother they

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.680
Yogi: could do both?

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.319
Interior is easier

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.799
interior work is easier.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.399
Here I saw in Sydney beautiful

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.839
I showed him beautiful roses and things. Yogi: at the centre

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.120
There are two types of things they do -

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:38.200
one which is a plain cornice

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.200
so what they do

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.080
is a plain cornice, you see

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.560
so they will do one thing like

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.320
they'll make a thing cut like that.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.400
in wood or sharpen it and then put it along the

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.280
they put the whole thing and just

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.440
take it out so the whole thing comes out of a (.....)

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.799
And they sometimes mix it with cement

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.080
so it takes time to set

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.680
or if you can mix it with salt also it takes time to set

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.880
because here you see, it sets very fast, yes.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.080
Doesn't take much time to set.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:27.200
So what they do they put a triangular thing first on the walls

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:31.960
and just take another sharp one which chops.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.080
He knows, hmm!

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.799
And for the roses and all I've seen beautiful things here

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.080
but as he had done is to make a Georgian style.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.560
We have used Georgian style in Our house

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.520
because it's a Georgian house.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.839
So, if you want I can send you the book.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:01.440
You can get it also here, I'm sure, on Georgian style of these plasterwork

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.960
Yogi: you can get it here.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.720
You had given Me the book

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.799
on Georgian style of house - you remember?

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.480
Yeah, yeah! Ah! you must see the

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.000
house - part of it has come how I have done it.

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.680
Come along, you'll be interested. Oh!

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:27.000
Only the ground floor, the ground floor has come up.

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:31.680
My bedroom and the entrance can see it here

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.279
This is the entrance I think

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.400
and you enter here

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.960
[UNCLEAR]

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:58.080
These are the pictures - entrance you see. This is a big hall.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.480
But we have done it more now.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.320
Yogi: Can everybody have a look at these, Mother? Yes, by all means.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.320
Now,

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.520
that's only one reception - the ground floor.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.720
Then we have one down below, we have one upstairs

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.320
and now this is leading to My bedroom - this one is.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.319
Have you seen the staircase? Show him the staircase.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.960
Yogi: That looks bit of the staircase there Mother.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.960
Yes, part of it but there is something showing very clearly

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.760
also staircase.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.520
Yogi: Where is this? This is from India.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.200
Yogi: Yes, gilded.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.080
Yogi: That's very beautiful! Mother: All right?

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.360
Yogi: That was done in India, was it, Mother? That, that part.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.920
This I would tell you

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.319
that this is the door through which We enter in, alright?

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.560
and this is a sort of a partition I've built in

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.400
which gives it an inside you see is a sort of a passage that side

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.319
and this is the thing for sitting down here which extends to that

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.399
at the same one, it's the extension of the same. Yogi: Yes.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.880
Yogi: That [UNCLEAR] is here

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.160
Yogi: This is a (....)

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.000
One they have taken in the daytime one in the night -

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.279
- so you see there are two types. (....)

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.200
But still this is the informal one. The formal one is even better

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.200
at upstairs, yeah.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.120
Yeah, is it, does it, now see this one is the

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.760
entrance to your Mother's bedroom -

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.560
in the daytime.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.040
This is a, this is actually

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.319
eh, what you call this black wood is ebony

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.080
this I've got it from India also.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.560
Then this is the one which is going down also.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.680
You see the passage going down to the kitchen?

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.880
And there's a dining room that side.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.520
Now, this is the again in the night - I think daytime.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.880
Now this is part of My bedroom, just a corner of My bedroom.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.800
Yogi: Yes. This is the corner of My bedroom Yogi: It's very beautiful

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.960
it's just a corner. I mean it's a very large bedroom -

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.839
it has a sitting place and all that and a batheing room.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.279
but just partly they have done it.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.040
Yogi: Is C.P. happy now, Mother with everything. Huun? Very.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.959
We're, you see, what you sent was all lost

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.000
because they couldn't make anything out of it.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.040
so again we had to re-do it and there were so many laws and regulations

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.080
but there's so many laws you can't imagine.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.720
That house is a Georgian house, listed house, 250 year old house

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.520
you can't do anything about it you can't

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.360
but despite that it has come out well.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.800
Actually he's amazed despite all the laws

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.800
I've been able to do something to that house.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.360
Y:Imagine what a lot of bother at not being able to do anything outside

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.840
No, inside also, inside also.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.759
We had to use only Georgian style things

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.920
they are very particularly they are - this is a 250 year old house.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.240
That's all, we did not know the laws.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.360
Yogi: The heavy blue one

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.720
Heavy blue one is beautiful. Yogi: and was it a blue one?

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.200
Yeah. Yogi: And a colourful one for children

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.960
has lots of flowers on it.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.200
Yogi: pink, pink flowers on it.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.560
They saw that very beautiful!

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.680
And you know how much it is? The flower one is forty-seven

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.440
rupees a meter can you imagine? Yogi: And the other one was sixty.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.240
All hand done.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.560
Yogi: I mean that's a quarter of price Mother: fifty-seven,

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.240
the other is fifty-seven.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.840
Yogi: Peter 's just saying you pay 300 rupees here, a meter.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.839
Still you can't get it.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.160
That work I don't know - can you get that work?

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.960
Yogi: It's imported from India here.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.480
That this one is the best among all of them.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.200
You see there are types and types

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.480
they were even 20 rupees available but We bought the best.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.600
And they did not charge you any customs or anything

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.880
when you brought these things with you?

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.919
Have you all seen it?

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.200
It's in the night that's why it is looking goldenish, you see.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.600
But if you see in the daytime it, I don't know why it looks bluish.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.040
Yogi: Depends what light is on.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.240
They should have had a standard lighting system

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.920
Standard lighting he must have done, he's very good way.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.560
But I think, you know, maybe, My influence.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.720
Yogi: What's that Mother? Must be My influence I think

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.040
in the house - vibrations wise

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.680
See this is pink, you see the same color as that.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.800
Yogi: Yet it's come out different but you see I've touched all these.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.080
What we should do is to have all the corners done and

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:07.560
put them together like that, alright. Yogi:That will make a panorama

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.920
This has come out alright - the colour,

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.759
this is also good colour the same colour. Yogi: Yes.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.040
Yogi: Yes see the colour of the chairs is correct.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.880
Actually that This is darker that's not so dark it's lighter

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.600
Yogi: but more reddish, you see more reddish also

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.400
but you like this. Yogi: Yes.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.480
Yogi: That was actually fabricated. Mother: It's a, We worked it out, yes.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.480
I've put a little gold on top here, you see

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:49.960
but this honeycomb is very good pattern also we must say -

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.600
pattern is very good, rare

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.280
but these look so nice on that - annh little, little things.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.560
Haan.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.800
Annh? Yogi: There isn't actually a hall there, is there,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.800
it just gives the effect of a hall.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.120
Hall. See it's a partial...

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.800
actually we should not make a hall completely separated.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.960
There is no need. We do it and by that we kill the effect

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.360
because hall looks so small and congested.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.720
This hall used to look very congested before.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.840
Now just because I've put a partition instead of the hall.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.319
And now we've done one more thing I must tell you here

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:39.320
is we have lifted this up a little from inside, from that side

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.879
and made a platform brought it Yogi: [UNCLEAR] Yes.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.080
brought it at the level of this. Yogi: I see

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.760
This is it is in one level.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:53.240
Y: Yes. And that side is lifted so that there is a platform on which

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.759
Yogi: A plinth, like a plinth base Yes,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.760
quite a big one.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.400
It is in one line you see now. Yogi: Yes, yes, yes.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.920
is in one line. It was like this, it is in one line.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.320
Yogi: Yes it would give it a better line. Then

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.359
Yogi: Did Laurent ever finish Your kitchen Mother Ha, ha, yes.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:24.800
You see, you see these are these are 250 year old tiles here

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.360
there it works and all the story of Christ and Bible.

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:37.080
This is the story of Bible and the another one is the

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:39.960
story of Christ, the one here.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.160
It doesn't show here but this (one is here?)

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.720
another one is here this

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.960
it doesn't show.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.160
Yogi: Mother, was the staircase satisfactory

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:02.839
- the one that came from India did that

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.720
Oh! that's the one here. Yogi: Hmm, nice

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.120
Yogi: You are pleased with it?

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.559
You, you have not seen all this?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.359
You have seen it.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.440
It has Yogi: I've seen

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.160
Yogi: prior to being gilded and after it's been gilded.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.920
Is he what? C.P. was like

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:25.920
lot of [UNCLEAR] found [UNCLEAR] try to convince him.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:33.799
These carpets are built-in carpets I must say - these are not real.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.160
Yogi: Not Indian?

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:39.439
The top one has got Indian.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.200
Yogi: These chandeliers look lovely there, Mother.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.479
Do they?

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.600
Showing the color though - it's pink color

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.200
the pink it was.  (....)

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.440
Where is the baby of Christine?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.280
Yogi: Diane's baby.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.919
No the other baby Yogi: No Christine No, not

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.080
Ehh!

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.280
Diane's baby with the other one whose got a (....)

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.880
Yogi: Oh, right, Sally's. Sally's

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.240
Sally's baby.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.400
You sit here.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.120
Yogi: He's sitting over there with his father. Bring him over forth

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.960
Are they getting better?

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.600
Suddenly it goes off. In two monthsâ€™ time they will suffer.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.480
Annh? Suddenly it goes Yogi: When he's tired, Mother.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.000
Yogi: When the muscles are fatigued.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.400
Come here, how are you?

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.480
Hmm! Iske bachche ki kaisi kaisi

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.120
isse se dil kitta kya ho jayega, dil ghabra gaya.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.599
Iske jo munh mein aata woh bolti thi, ki Mataji ka [UNCLEAR]

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.200
main bahut buri huun Sahajyogini huun mujhe bahut Mataji [UNCLEAR]

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.679
aur main jo keh rahin huun [UNCLEAR] (long 4 minute break in tape then restarts)

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.880
Nothing is happening, there is nothing to cry.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:45.640
Yes, no, there's nothing to cry it's all fun yes, yes. (....)

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.200
Which like soups and things.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.960
Yogini: One month old Yes, you should start.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:53.599
Little bit soup is alright. Yogi: strained, Mother: Nothing wrong in doing it.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.760
Strained, absolutely strained - just water.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.160
But little soup and things like will be good for them.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.759
Yogi: In barley water soup, barley soup and In

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.240
barley, little bit, barley water is very good.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:09.200
Barley water or you can start with juices if you like

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.799
and then go to soups and then to

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.640
- I mean the system must get used to that, you see.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.000
Gradually you must bring 'round children to food

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.400
not suddenly the heavy food.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.880
Y: Adrian six months he hasn't had anything [UNCLEAR]

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.720
Y: because we got the message You said that it was six months

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.480
that they should have food for the first time.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.360
Food is different I mean this is Yogi: This is a clear liquid

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.880
Yogini: You know that's that's the way we

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.960
Food means solid food

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.200
solid food you see what you can give them rice

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.920
and dal cooked together make it very

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.400
because if you train up the system properly. Yogini: Yes.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:52.560
First you start with juices then come to soups

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:58.240
and then come to solid food in the sense that it is semi-solid.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.280
You can cook rice and dal together make a khichdi - she knows that

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.560
to make it. Thin it out and give it to the child

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.280
that you can do but not this dal - moong dal

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.680
moong dal and rice you can cook together and start with that

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.240
after six months. Food means when there are solid parts.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.040
But juices and soups you must start.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.280
Yogini: Yes. Important. Yogi: and water.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.680
And water you should start immediately.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.920
After a month you should start water, boiled water you must start.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.280
But I saw your child getting a

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:41.080
isn't it your child was having water alright.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.040
Yes. Yes, what is her age? Yogini: she's ten months

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.240
Yogi: Ten, ten months. Yogini: He's ten months.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.320
Ten months I saw - but when you started? Yogi: At what age?

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.040
You had they had water.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.920
That's good. So they had water.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.440
Now what else you wanted to know?

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.640
Yogini: The baby's waking at night, Mother

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.559
Y: what do we do to get them out of doing waking up at night time?

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.280
You see there are because they're wet in the night that's why

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.720
they get up, isn't it, or for no rhyme and reason?

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.040
Yogini: Yes, no rhyme and reason.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.719
Alright, so what you have to do is to massage their body with oil

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.680
and massage their head with oil

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.880
put lot of oil in their heads, you see

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.800
and then put some powder and clean it up, you see.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.440
Give them a massage in the night, they'll sleep very well.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.680
They won't get up.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.879
In the night you should give them a massage in case

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.519
they are restless in the night or something like that

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.360
before sleeping.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.520
You give them their last meal, say about what time you

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.520
give them last. 8 o'clock or 6 o'clock?

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:05.160
Yogini: It depends on their age

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.320
Yogini: Gabriel and Luke have their dinner at about 6 o'clock

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.760
Yogini: Adrian has... he goes to bed at

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.920
Yogini: his last meal at about 7.30 - 8.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.040
Alright, so what you do 6 o' clock

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.920
you give him one feed, alright and

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.559
eh 9 o'clock another one - you can give like that.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.640
One one more in the 9 o'  so they won't be hungry

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:32.200
but in between you can do the massage for the body.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.680
Say about 7 o'clock you can do the massage.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.679
Alright. Yogini: Yes, Mother.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.840
So, 7.30 then he goes to bed.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.240
9 o'clock in his sleep he must have

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.040
in his sleep and then in the morning he'll get up at about 5

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.400
that's all.

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.800
It's very simple 5 or 6.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.519
But I think you people don't massage the body so much of them - dry.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.000
We have to massage it twice in the beginning.

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.519
Twice - one in the night, one in the daytime.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.440
Alright, now what else?

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.040
Yogi: When do they stop breast-feeding, Mother?

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.200
Ten months. Gradually they should take to bottle.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.240
Ten months they can stop ten, twelve, you see.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.519
In India they used to stop after three years nobody bothered.

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.960
But it's better to stop it by ten, eleven or eleven months or so.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.880
Yogi: If they don't get the mother's milk

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.320
Yogi: say they have to cut it short

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.920
Of course, of course you should take to bottle

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.559
no harm in giving bottle milk.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.280
Do it properly but you see if you do not give the nipple

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.000
in the mouth of the child of the bottle

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.760
from the very beginning or say about one or two months

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.240
or three months at the most they won't take to it easily.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.519
So best is to give one, one feed after three months.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.280
Start giving them one feed.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.879
When the child is sleeping you give one feed.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.800
then the child is used to the nipple, you see. You have to

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.080
understand the child has to get used to everything.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.000
Yogini: Yes. Then they easily move but otherwise you suddenly

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.519
Yogini: Yes, yes Mother, they were started at six months

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.840
Yogini: but then they just don't want to eat the food that's given

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.080
Yogini: them some of the other babies that have been eating

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.599
solid food for a while. Because the food is not tasty

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.680
Yogini: It's not tasty. Annh!

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.120
You must make it tastier you see, you must put proper salt

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:23.400
Salt must be properly put and little tasty it must be made

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.960
you see, a little bit of butter, little bit.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.280
You see, you must make it tasty otherwise the food is not tasty

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:36.240
they don't like it. The tongue, just like us.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.040
Yogi: You tell her Mother in Sydney they must have salt

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.599
Yogi: in their food and they must...

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.320
Annh, this is a very funny idea not to have salt.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.400
You all, do you all suffer from high blood pressure?

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.840
Yogi:[UNCLEAR] You see, without salt

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.719
you cannot do your respiration - ask any doctor.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.920
If there is no sodium, sodium chloride in your blood

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.120
see your respiration will go down.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.120
These things are essential for life but not too much of everything.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.519
Salt is needed with food.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.800
I mean these are all funny ideas that are coming up

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:18.400
but the worse thing is that you are so naÃ¯ve just like children.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.160
I mean if anybody tells that don't take salt we'll just be

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.440
saying oh! you, you must be coming from lunatic asylum.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.759
But if you are suffering from high blood pressure,

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.720
if there's a problem of that or something then you skip.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.200
Salt is very important for teeth for everything.

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.280
To feel relaxed is the best way to reduce the blood pressure.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.160
What else is? Yogi: There's also a belief that if you give children

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.760
Yogi: sweet food as a small baby and child that it will grow up and

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.000
Yogi: have blood sugar problems.

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.720
Yogi: So they give very sour, sweet, sour lemon, sour food

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.880
I told that, you see how blood sugar comes in

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.720
because of diabetes isn't it, not because of sugar.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.280
It comes only because of diabetes

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.120
and diabetes comes because of thinking too much.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.080
If you make your child agitated all the time

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.920
you want him to think and do this very well in the school at the age

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.800
of five years if you want him to do 'O' level

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.280
then what would happen?

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.200
You see she want to
01:25:24:10 01:25:27:21make the child, do competition, what is left over by you then.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.800
Take it easy. Let the child study as well as grow normally.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.840
Yogi: Is it wise to for the baby to sleep in the

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.800
same bed as the parents and up to what age, Mother?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.160
To very small six age. Not every time it's not proper.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:48.559
I don't think it's good all the time but little bit while

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.520
and then the child must sleep in all [UNCLEAR] in his bed.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.120
Always sleeping in his bed is the best

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.320
but in the same room not in some other room.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.960
But then you should take the baby to with you

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.280
when you are nursing or anything for a while

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.639
that's all but mostly the child should be in the bed.

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.800
It's not with the parents if he's sleeping

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.880
between the two parents to be crushed

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.400
Yogi: And then until what age should young

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.360
children be kept in the same bedroom?

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.840
I think even now My children sleep with Me, so what can I do?

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.120
I think We are different type of people.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.440
We don't undress ourselves when we sleep.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.960
That's the problem with you.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.320
I hope Sahaja yogis are not sleeping like that.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.720
Please don't sleep without clothes - bhoots will enter into you.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.520
Must wear your clothes and then sleep.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.760
I'm telling you don't sleep without clothes.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:45.120
Bhoots, that's the best way the bhoots enter you.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.160
What is the need I don't understand.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.080
Yogini: Mother this umm

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.679
Y: some of the babies have been experiencing a lot of pain while

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.440
Y: they're cutting their teeth for their teeth are coming through

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.040
Yes, a very old medicine called Steveman's powder

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.400
Steveman's powder, write it down.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.400
Get some ivory rings, are very good for children.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.440
Ivory rings. Y: Teething rings. Ivory rings you get them in India.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.760
You get here plastic ones we get ivory ones.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.680
You get some of these rings - are very good for children.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.920
Yogi: Albert you gonna get those?

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.320
Yogi: Ivory rings, rings, teething rings.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.400
Yogini: Mother, another question.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.040
Yogini: What do you think about dummies for the babies?

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.440
Dummies? Yogini: Yes, you know dummies are

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:45.160
Yogini: the litle rubber thing shape like a nipple to an extent and

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.759
You see, they might develop that teeth are

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.200
coming out if you give too much of that.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.839
Yogini: Yes, if you give too much but a little bit of

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.920
maybe to settle the baby down to sleep

01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:01.080
It's alright, little bit is alright, but try to keep it away.

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.320
You see, best is to give vishudhdhi treatment

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.040
and not have it otherwise the teeth will be running parallel

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.960
Y: Yes Mother. and you'll have lot of problem setting them back.

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.599
Yogi: Yes. Haan! But it's true - little bit you can give that.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.000
They are called as dummies, are they? Y: Dummies they call, yes.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.720
Yogini: dummy nipples Mother: Han, alright, there's no harm.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.920
Yogi: They want to know about toilet training, Mother.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.880
What is that? Yogi: How to stop the baby from

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.880
Yogi: wetting the nappies and using the pot, basically?

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.160
For that at the age of only two months or three months

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.559
you must start touching the bottom of the baby to your pot

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.880
you see, keep a little pot like that and try to say, make some sound

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.559
like that and all that the child starts seeing it and

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.680
he gets used to the touch, you see, of the thing

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:59.360
Then he he knows that's an impulse, you see, in him

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.640
that acts as a message and you can do it.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.760
It's very simple. Y: Very early then. Very early you must start it

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.640
very early Yogini: We don't do that.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.400
That's it because you have these dry drips, that's why.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.360
Yogi: Mr. Freud said we shouldn't do it, Mother. Why?

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:18.480
Yogi: It'll give you a complex. Mother: What?

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.840
What is the complex?

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.200
Yogi: No, that's right. Complex?

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.280
We all Indians do it. We don't have any complexes I think [UNCLEAR]

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.520
The one who has given you real complex is Mr. Freud himself.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.040
What complex can be, kya hoga? I can't understand.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.360
Beyond My imagination. Yogi: Whole this nonsense about

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.200
Yogi: how you were toilet trained and if you,

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.320
Yogi: It explains why you behave in a certain way when you're

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.880
Yogi: grown up and according to how you sat on the potty and

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:58.960
Yogi: It's true, Mother.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.560
We don't even know about these things

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.640
How could [UNCLEAR] nonsense, ha, ha ha.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.760
Yogini: Another question, Mother. Mother: That's why you people

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.320
are very addicted to bathrooms also, we are not.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.360
You see, we are there hardly for 5-10 minutes,

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.480
have a bath get out of it, you see.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.800
The addiction comes from that kind of a thing.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.160
You're very bathroom cultured, that's why.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.639
Yogi: All this graffiti business is Graffiti?

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.200
Yogi: Graffiti - writing on the walls

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.440
Yogi:  all that stuff it's all coming from that.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.800
Writing on the walls?

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.480
The best thing if you are constipated take a newspaper -

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.400
simple thing and horrid news

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.240
that's how I've seen some people have treated them.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.080
They say, "We get constipated".

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.200
I said read a newspaper in the morning.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:19.519
That's the place you should read newspaper actually, nowhere else.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.840
That it is worth, nothing else you know.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.360
I would do that.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.680
Mean I don't get any chance or anything I would say that better

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.840
read it in, newspaper in the bathroom - that's the place it's

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.280
because such filth in there.

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:52.280
No, no, no he's, I tell you he must be a sweeper in his last life.

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.080
Must be something wrong with this Freud, I think

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.800
must have been a sweeper.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.280
Yogi: 12 years ago in England, Mother, there was a man

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.679
Yogi: called Dr. Alex Comfort who's basically a

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:05.080
Yogi: descendant of Freudian psychology who's said that

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.759
Yogi: you should have contraceptives available in the market place

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.720
for children to buy as from the age of twelve.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.720
Yogi: So that's now far we've gone. For what?

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.160
Yogi: Contraception..... Oh, Oh, I see, what fun we have!

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.280
Oh, Oh! This is another joke.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:24.560
I thought must be for constipation some

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.240
Yogi: Maybe that

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.559
Yogi: that's instead of the new

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.120
But where we are boys don't even understand these things.

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.280
Yogi: They do here, Mother, in the West.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.480
In the West maybe, here they are overgrown.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.040
You don't allow them to be natural

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.920
putting all these ideas into the head.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.519
Twelve year boy - Yogi: Hmm.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.920
always their nonsense

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:09.240
Yogini: Mother, some more questions. Hmmm.

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:13.720
Yogini: What should mothers do about constipation in the babies?

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.360
You see, they should not have constipation themselves.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.600
Yogini: Well they do, when they're on the formula mixtures.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:22.280
Yes so we, we have so many ways of removing in India

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.519
like we take that ajwain ka churan and all that all the time when

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:31.480
the little black grapes, dried ones, raisins - black raisins,

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:36.960
yes, fruits with a, with orange juice - orange juice is very good

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.800
and also milk, boiled milk in the night. Hmmm, very good.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.720
Yogini: That's another thing Mother when

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.080
Yogini: when they weaned from the mother's breast

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:49.599
Yogini: are they weaned onto cow's milk

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:51.880
To what? Yogini: Cow's milk do we

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.440
Yogi: From breast to cow's milk or from breast to formula mixture?

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.080
I mean, we give cow's milk.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.960
Because this formula nowadays I don't know what they do that.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.840
Yogi: It makes black stools it's

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.800
If you get cow's milk better is to remove the cream

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.760
put the water in it and boil it.

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.960
Remove the cream and that's the best for the children.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.719
But boil it together not separately.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:23.880
Always boil the milk and the water together, never separately.

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.480
Yogi: So all these mothers on formula should transfer to cow's milk.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.160
Yogi: All these mothers who are feeding their babies on formula

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.440
Yogi: on this mixture, on this powdered stuff

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.720
Yogi: should change to cow's milk?

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.640
Yes, I mean if the children can digest cow's milk nothing like that

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.440
if they can digest. But you must know

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.680
what is the amount of water you should put

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.000
Yogi: Proportion because that's more natural to take to cow's milk.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.720
Yogi: Well you're supposed to be feeding them off the breast, if you cannot feed them off the breast

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.640
No, but what we do then, you see, for some time you

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.200
can take formula because might be it is better

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.879
according to the age group

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.640
but say after ten months you can take to cow's milk alright.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.680
But little bit one feed you should start

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.160
by the time they are about three months

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:17.880
before they are conscious, must start one feed.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.480
Is she giving one feed at least to the baby or not?

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:25.680
No, not yet. No, no, not her. I'm saying

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.800
hmmm Barbara

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.360
Barbara, is she giving one feed to the baby?

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.400
Yogini: No, Mother, only breast milk, Mother: only breast milk?

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.680
You should start now all right, otherwise again he'll be very angry

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.280
with the bottle. Y: he is, Mother

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.879
I tried with the bottle before he doesn't like it. See?

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.240
So, must, better start earlier always

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.160
- one feed you must start earlier.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.599
Say one month you can start because children

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.880
here are very adamant type you see.

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.440
What other things?

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.160
Yogini: Medication for children. Yogini: Mother,

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.040
Yogini: a lot of Panadol given to the babies

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.320
Panadol? For what? Yogini: Yes Mother

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:11.960
Yogini: For temperatures or irritability. Teething

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.520
Yogini: when the baby is crying or upset.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:17.080
I don't think Panadol is a very good thing

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.599
- horrible. Yogi: No, it contains

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:21.280
It's not a very good thing, you see, just Yogi: It contains Aspirin

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.040
- Paracetamol

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.639
It can make the child very bad later on

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.640
see, after the effect. Y: Liver - it could cause liver problems.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.480
Oh, really? it's not good you see

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.320
say a child is irritable or anything, you see,

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.920
you should find out what is exactly the trouble is,

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.480
is it due to the stomach trouble or anything?

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.480
Then according to that you should give but there are natural

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.520
things that you should give to the baby and not unnatural.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.560
Say a child has got a diarrhoea, alright,

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.760
a simple method is to boil this fennel

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.400
Yogi: Fennel, fennel fennel.  - fennel, fennel seeds

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:58.680
and mint together, boil it. Keep it ready

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.520
and give that with little sugar or candy sugar

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.760
and give that to the child twice, thrice.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.160
Simple things like that I can give you so many medicines.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.000
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.840
Very simple. You should see why the child is sick.

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.160
Panadol is something like a sleeping pill only.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:17.920
Yogini: Yes, it is.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.240
That's very bad at that age.

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.800
Yogini: Another question, Mother.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.880
Yogi: What about gripe water, Mother - do we use that?

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.120
For the baby is alright but what about the mother?

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.320
Mother has to take it out now, what else.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.080
Wind - what you can get here.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.800
You must be having some medicines for wind,

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:48.160
Yogi: Just the usual ones, Mother. Antacids or something (unclear)

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.200
Yogi: It's fairly innocuous, isn't it?

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.759
Yogi: It - do they boil the alcohol off it?

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.120
What is that?

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:04.000
Y: It originally has some small volume of alcohol. 4%, 4%.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.400
What is it? Yogis: 4% alcohol In what?

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.240
Yogis: In gripe water. Gripe

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.680
No we don't give gripe water to the children at all.

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.280
We give this ajwain water and to the mother.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.320
There's another way is to

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.080
ajwain is the only thing I know very well because -

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.559
I'll find out for you there's something else that you can have.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.640
Y: Should the mothers have a diet avoiding wind producing foods.

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:37.320
Ha of course, they should not eat rice at all.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.640
They should not eat rice, they should

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.480
not eat anything that is grown under the earth.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:48.599
Potato also they should not - anything like that.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:53.720
Rice, potatoes all these things must be avoided. Yogini: Yes Mother

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.120
You don't know these?

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.519
Y: No, we've never [UNCLEAR]

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.960
Rice, rice is never given to a woman who's got a baby

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.360
Till about ten months she must avoid taking rice.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:18.320
Yogi: So, any wind producing food should be avoided by the mother.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.520
Haan! Everything that comes from the Mother Earth

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.720
in the sense from the down below Mother Earth gives and also milk -

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.560
milk gives wind very much.

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.640
Milk gives - but milk boiled in an iron pot

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.280
you see, made out of steel

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.320
but not this stainless one, the other one, doesn't give.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.679
Yogini: No Milk boiled in an ordinary steel, cast iron pan doesn't give wind

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:51.400
Yogi: a steel pot, cast iron doesn't give wind. We have a cast iron

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.599
So you should boil that milk

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:02.240
with water whatever it is together in an iron pot.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.960
So, milk should not be taken like that by mothers directly at all.

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.040
If she has to take milk then take it with

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.960
some sort of a porridge or some at the most.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.519
She has to take milk, no doubt, so she should take it with the

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.320
porridge or these crispies or something like.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.480
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.080
Yogi: What about nappies, Mother?

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.840
Some of the nappies make their legs go out

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.840
Yogi: at 45 degrees. Oh! that's horrible thing that

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.600
you make the children wear, I'm really against it.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:35.080
It's very handy but it's very bad.

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.040
Poor, this girl has suffered so much

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.759
even now she has problems you see.

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.360
A plastic stuff - but we don't use plastic stuff, you see.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.880
We use cotton ones - nice cotton ones

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:54.400
and we put little, what you call absorbent cotton.

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.640
Yogi: I think we call them flannelette napkins here Mother.

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.400
Hmmm. And then we remove the cotton if the

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.840
napkin is also wet, we remove the napkin - it can be washed.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.480
You see, we can have about 12 or say 24

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.320
kept like that - it's very simple how to make it, I'll show you

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:18.680
[alright?] This is the say is the nappy

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:23.160
so you get a soft cloth - some sort of a malmal or something

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.040
- in India you get such a lot of them - readymade

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:29.760
Now what you do is to make it like that, alright.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.080
Yogini: Yes. Now it's done.

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:36.840
not a thing like this for a little baby

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.880
but you can have a soft towel you can get

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.440
Yogini: We get, we get soft towelling

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.120
Yogini: many of us do it that way

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.639
Alright, and then you must wash them.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:51.960
Hardly it takes any time for you to wash - say in

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:55.000
a day you take about - in the beginning they are

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.440
small and you need more numbers

01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.600
later on you don't need them but you don't have all

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.200
these problems of the plastic for the baby

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.160
and the child is allowed to breathe, his body grows well

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:10.320
otherwise they have the back side is so pushed in funny figures and

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.880
they also have what you call the legs going like that.

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.120
Yogi: Hip, hip joints go

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.240
It's very bad, it's very strong and should be avoided.

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.400
Yogini: You mean the disposables or do you mean

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:23.520
The disposable are not good thing

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:25.520
only if you are going out somewhere, you see

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.480
this kind of a cloth is the best.

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:32.160
This is a soft one but this is very good, still

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.360
for a little, newly born is thick for us.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.600
You see, we don't do all this, we don't seam it.

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.040
Not to seam it at all. It hard, you see

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.920
just take, open it out just like that - just we don't seam it.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.160
and now put it out like that - it's too big

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:53.280
for a big child is alright. Now, that's all.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.599
You can even if you want you can put like this for a big boy

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.240
here a little fold but normally for a little baby it's alright.
