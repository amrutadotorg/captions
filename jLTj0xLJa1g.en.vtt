00:07.150 --> 00:10.873
It was really a wonderful idea

00:11.074 --> 00:17.211
to put My attention to all these fields
of life, which are very important

00:17.412 --> 00:25.892
and, as it is, I have attention on the all
of them, and I care for all that.

00:26.092 --> 00:31.652
But I would say now you all people
put in your attention to it,

00:31.852 --> 00:37.091
because it is you who can do
something about it.

00:37.172 --> 00:39.872
You can start with the nature,
as they said, is this:

00:39.953 --> 00:42.571
we have to be kind to the nature.

00:42.652 --> 00:45.624
We are having such problems - people
are cutting out trees,

00:45.825 --> 00:49.972
doing all these kinds of things, without
even thinking

00:50.172 --> 00:55.268
that this is for the progeny will become
a desert.

00:55.469 --> 01:02.689
So in the same way for everything,
for your fruits and agriculture,

01:02.890 --> 01:08.491
vibrations can really change. We had
in our garden, you won't believe,

01:08.692 --> 01:14.282
a peony flower just like this, even bigger
then this, very bigger.

01:14.483 --> 01:22.559
We have never seen such a flower.
We had also the tulips so big as that.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.412
I haven't seen such tulips in My lifetime.

01:25.612 --> 01:28.652
With vibrations you can improve everywhere.

01:28.892 --> 01:35.136
Say you go and see some politician,
let's say, or some political party,

01:35.337 --> 01:39.492
then you use your hands and give them
bandhans all the time.

01:39.692 --> 01:42.621
You can sit on the table across

01:42.822 --> 01:47.181
and under the table you go on giving
them bandhan.

01:48.869 --> 01:54.252
You have powers, but if you don’t use
your powers, then it is useless –

01:54.453 --> 01:57.637
if you just go on thinking about building
up yourself

01:57.838 --> 02:01.533
and looking after yourself - now those days
are gone.

02:01.614 --> 02:04.800
Now you have to look after other things,
and I was very much happy

02:04.881 --> 02:09.010
with all the things that they have shown
and all My attention is already there.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.391
But if you people also put your attention…

02:11.592 --> 02:16.293
As you know I have already purchased
seven big, big lands,

02:16.494 --> 02:19.772
about fifty to sixty acres of lands
in Maharashtra

02:19.972 --> 02:23.251
for different projects and these projects
have started.

02:23.452 --> 02:26.993
Now in Delhi also we have a very huge,
big plan

02:27.194 --> 02:31.292
to put the women who are destitutes.

02:31.492 --> 02:34.811
First, on the social level we have to do
something, I thought.

02:35.012 --> 02:38.735
So it’s all done, now we have started a
school, we have started a academy again –

02:38.936 --> 02:41.231
we are going to have another academy.

02:41.432 --> 02:46.989
And also teaching young people with
vocational knowledge and all that.

02:47.190 --> 02:52.491
India has, that way, is not so progressed
as you people are in these things.

02:52.692 --> 02:56.290
But there’s one thing very great about
India is that –

02:56.491 --> 03:03.778
because of our culture maybe, because
of our Indian style of life of respect,

03:03.979 --> 03:10.189
people have become very well equipped for
the software; you see, this kind of thing.

03:10.390 --> 03:14.771
They are very intelligent in software,
because their attention penetrates.

03:14.972 --> 03:18.051
So if you also penetrate your attention,

03:18.252 --> 03:21.384
I mean, you can achieve the same.
You are higher than them.

03:21.585 --> 03:24.625
But because they have been brought up
in that culture,

03:24.826 --> 03:32.084
they are very intelligent, but their
attention is not spread out, no.

03:32.285 --> 03:36.473
It is not. It is just on one point and they
penetrate very well.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.612
And they are doing so well now that
a day will come

03:39.812 --> 03:42.851
when India will become one of the most
prosperous country.

03:43.052 --> 03:45.350
So this is what has to happen,

03:45.551 --> 03:49.032
that, firstly, the our culture has to be
brought round

03:49.233 --> 03:54.211
to such a state that the children get
all the positive ideas

03:54.412 --> 03:58.812
and a good character and proper building:
with love, affection.

03:59.013 --> 04:01.455
But not to spoil them. Not to spoil them.

04:01.656 --> 04:05.288
They should be brought up in such
a manner, that they develop

04:05.489 --> 04:12.613
a proper view of the whole thing and also
they have penetration of their attention.

04:12.814 --> 04:17.481
But if you go on changing your attention
all the time, the inside is finished,

04:17.682 --> 04:23.371
I mean, because you see attention gets –
what you call it - broken.

04:23.572 --> 04:27.411
So this penetration of attention has to be
seen.

04:27.612 --> 04:35.132
Is, say, for example, you look at some
tree: then just watch it with love.

04:35.332 --> 04:38.031
See what the tree is talking to you,
what is she saying?

04:38.232 --> 04:42.292
You’re just looking at a mountain -
then just talk to the mountain,

04:42.492 --> 04:44.994
and see what the mountain is saying to you.

04:45.195 --> 04:50.937
Put your attention in, completely on one
thing and see for yourself,

04:51.138 --> 04:54.892
that will help you a lot. But if you have
an attention

04:55.092 --> 04:58.772
which is all the time watching this,
watching that, this, that -

04:58.972 --> 05:04.072
and criticising is another way you miss out
on attention.

05:04.273 --> 05:08.492
Lots of attention goes to this. Thirdly:
could be the,

05:08.692 --> 05:11.722
as I said, is self-importance; is the worst
thing.

05:11.923 --> 05:14.371
In that, then, you do not think anything
is important,

05:14.452 --> 05:21.215
you just go on looking after your self-
importance. There's so many ways,

05:21.416 --> 05:28.302
but the best way is to learn how to handle
your own attention,

05:28.503 --> 05:32.651
and how to handle other people.
That’s very important.

05:32.852 --> 05:37.052
How you deal with people is very important
for a sahaja yogi.

05:37.252 --> 05:42.052
You see, if you deal in a proper way,
in a decent manner,

05:42.252 --> 05:47.612
in a way that’s congenial, that’s
appreciative,

05:47.812 --> 05:51.876
then you will find so many friends, and
they will try to find out

05:52.077 --> 05:56.972
how are you like this, how are you so
peaceful, how are you so kind,

05:57.172 --> 05:59.857
why are you not agitated like others are.

06:00.058 --> 06:03.579
So in your own lifestyle you can establish
it.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.331
But when you are dealing with others,
what I am saying,

06:06.412 --> 06:10.507
that the social relations with others
is very important.

06:10.708 --> 06:13.299
Now, at what level you should start
I can’t say.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.117
Depends on your temperament and aptitude.

06:17.318 --> 06:20.852
But whichever of these areas that you think
is important,

06:21.052 --> 06:24.371
you can just try to find out what is
the solution,

06:24.572 --> 06:30.091
how can you help it here, how can you
work it out. All of you can do it.

06:30.292 --> 06:37.131
It is not that you have to develop a kind
of a party to fight anything.

06:37.332 --> 06:42.867
But to have your own attention, you will
know the solutions of many problems.

06:43.068 --> 06:47.475
Many problems can be solved if you
find out the solution.

06:47.676 --> 06:51.328
But a solution you can find with your
concentration of mind.

06:51.529 --> 06:56.052
That is very important. And if you can
really do that,

06:56.252 --> 07:01.529
all these problems that you face today,
in those different fields of life,

07:01.730 --> 07:05.183
can be easily solved. It’s not so
difficult.

07:05.384 --> 07:09.856
Family life as you said can be solved,
depending on the wife

07:10.057 --> 07:16.403
and depending on the husband and their
relationship. Is very simple it is.

07:17.071 --> 07:19.791
But somehow or other our background is
such, I think,

07:19.992 --> 07:25.572
that we don’t understand simple things.
We only understand complicated things.

07:25.772 --> 07:31.851
In a simple way, if you deal with people
at different levels

07:32.052 --> 07:38.165
in these different aspects of life,
you’ll be amazed

07:38.366 --> 07:44.368
you will be very much popular, people will
want to know what sort of a thing it is.

07:44.569 --> 07:47.368
I’ll tell you one gentleman. His name was
Mr. Dhumal.

07:47.569 --> 07:49.485
He is no more. They know him.

07:49.686 --> 07:52.697
He was in the village, he was used to –
he was looking after

07:52.898 --> 08:00.132
his fields and things, he was like
a farmer.

08:00.332 --> 08:03.492
And somehow he got realization in Poona.

08:03.693 --> 08:07.345
After getting realization in Poona he went
to his own place

08:07.546 --> 08:09.900
and he started Sahaja Yoga there.

08:10.101 --> 08:14.955
And he started giving them realization,
this and that.

08:15.156 --> 08:21.053
And it was surprising, because he never
came, as such, to Me,

08:21.254 --> 08:26.642
or he never came to Poona - and suddenly
he developed that, you see,

08:26.843 --> 08:29.773
mind of concentration.

08:29.974 --> 08:34.331
And the people told Me, “Mother, he’s got
so many sahaja yogis”.

08:34.531 --> 08:38.970
He has developed it with such
understanding,

08:39.171 --> 08:41.246
and when I went there, I was surprised

08:41.447 --> 08:45.083
that we had more sahaja yogis there
than we had in Poona!

08:45.284 --> 08:48.508
When in Poona there were sahaja yogis
who were doing the work,

08:48.709 --> 08:52.831
but this one single fellow had changed
the whole idea

08:53.032 --> 08:57.215
of people in Ahmadnagar and Rahuri.

08:57.416 --> 09:02.959
Very surprising it was, that I mean, he was
just a simple man and a farmer type,

09:03.175 --> 09:08.567
and then he started using vibrations
for his activities and things.

09:08.768 --> 09:11.307
And it was so remarkable,

09:11.508 --> 09:15.375
that actually he was, as I said, not very
educated and all that,

09:15.576 --> 09:18.107
but we always went and stayed in his house,

09:18.308 --> 09:21.424
and we were really enamoured by the way

09:21.625 --> 09:24.851
he tried to express his spirituality
to others.

09:25.052 --> 09:27.889
In the same way all of you can do it.
