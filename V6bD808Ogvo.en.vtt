00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.020
You see when you meditate;

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:14.413
how do you meditate on different chakras?

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:20.343
Say you have to meditate on Mooladhara,

00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:25.111
now you pay attention towards Mooladhara

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:34.618
and take the name of Shri Ganesha. Say the mantra.

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:39.227
You know there are four petals; so every…

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:43.400
– that mantra should be every time should be four times should be said.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.412
Four into four you can say. Pay attention there.

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:54.977
Now physically also say we have a Nabhi Chakra

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:57.787
so many of you catch at Nabhi.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:01.394
If you have a liver problem,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.996
you can rub a little sugar on your Nabhi, will be a good idea.

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:14.535
Or if you have the left hand side problem of Nabhi

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.199
if you rub a little oil or ghee or something it will be a good idea.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.285
And then concentrate on that. Try to put attention on to that

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:26.645
specially the chakras which are not all right.

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:31.536
You just pay attention to it and meditate on them.

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:34.653
Pay attention to it is the main point.

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:38.560
If you pay attention with the mantras saying,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.072
that’s how you can meditate on every chakra.

00:01:42.192 --> 00:01:47.147
And if two people can do it, is a better idea.

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:51.719
Is, you see, in your back, on your back;

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:57.610
if you show the spinal chord, you can see what chakras are bulging out.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.862
Other person can tell you these are the portions which are bulging out.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:06.231
So you go on saying the mantras of that chakra paying attention

00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:09.770
and the other person can tell you whether it is all right or not.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.027
For every chakra there is a mantra, which you know.

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:19.279
Apart from mantra, you must know what things should be used

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:24.458
which element should be used for which chakra.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:30.601
For example, for using say, Mooladhara chakra,

00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:34.183
best way to clear out Mooladhara chakra is sit on the ground.

00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:38.353
It’s the best way. I’ve told you how to do the exercise

00:02:38.473 --> 00:02:41.256
to be able to sit on the ground straight,

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:46.099
it’s very good idea of asking the mother earth

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.770
to clear out your Mooladhara.

00:02:50.857 --> 00:02:55.895
For say example, if you have to clear out say your Nabhi,

00:02:56.015 --> 00:03:02.211
for Nabhi is made out of the water element

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:07.819
and that’s why you have to ask the water element to help you.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.624
And for Nabhi water element is the best.

00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:14.102
If you can use the water element to clear your Nabhi,

00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:16.530
it will be a very good idea.

00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:22.201
Like that, every chakra is made from some element as it is.

00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:28.134
Swadisthana is made of earth and water;

00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:31.713
so the sea is the best for Swadhistana.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:35.073
If you could go to the sea and work out on Swadhisthana,

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:36.668
will be the best for you.

00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:41.803
In the ocean or you can use salt and water for Swadhisthana;

00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:43.606
will be very good.

00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:51.922
Then we can say that for the heart chakra, heart chakra is,

00:03:52.042 --> 00:03:59.333
has to do with the, what you call, the akash.

00:04:01.803 --> 00:04:07.568
Firmament, with the firmament, this heart chakra is with the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.884
– ah, no not firmament, akash? Akash “ne”, [no in Hindi].

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:20.491
It’s made out of air [Hindi mika he?] Air is called vayu, vayu is air.

00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:24.760
Air or you call it air as an element you call the word air?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.551
Or firmament? Firmament is ether, in English isn’t it?

00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:35.160
So air, you can say air, air element is for the heart chakra.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:41.411
So for that, I have told you how to do, I mean, breathing.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:46.083
Breathing is the best way of hold your breath before the photograph.

00:04:46.344 --> 00:04:50.849
Or you can take the breath in, deep breathing

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.125
and releasing it for a longer period.

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.136
Cleaning it, all these exercises are there.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:05:02.084
Then you see the mantra is of raksha, is the protection,

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:06.876
to ask for the protection is all with the air. All right?

00:05:06.996 --> 00:05:13.882
Then we come to this one is here is the

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.104
akash, must be firmament.

00:05:49.352 --> 00:05:52.506
What is a firmament in English?

00:05:53.776 --> 00:05:57.175
Ether? Firmament is ether? All right,

00:05:57.295 --> 00:06:00.485
so this is the firmament, you see,

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:03.040
I read one translation but I was not sure.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.080
This is the akash, is the sky. This is the sky, here, all right?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.781
This is made out of the sky firmament

00:06:12.901 --> 00:06:16.020
and this is made out of the light. (Agya)

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:27.280
Firmament is sky, is it? So this is sky;

00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:31.155
that’s why it is Virata this thing.

00:06:32.878 --> 00:06:36.604
And this is your light.

00:06:36.724 --> 00:06:39.253
So for Agnya chakra you have to use the light,

00:06:39.373 --> 00:06:41.298
for this you have to use the sky.

00:06:41.418 --> 00:06:44.456
If your hands put up like this if you say “Allah hu Akbar”

00:06:44.576 --> 00:06:48.149
put both the hands towards the sky. See like that.

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:50.233
There are so many ways of using the sky,

00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:52.233
watching the sky, looking at the sky.

00:06:52.353 --> 00:06:57.763
And for this the sun and the light is to be used.

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:02.522
Now supposing you are suffering from say left side problem,

00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:05.478
is sort of you’re possessed or something,

00:07:05.598 --> 00:07:07.631
then you can use the sun you see

00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:09.924
because the sun will give you balance.

00:07:10.044 --> 00:07:12.598
But if you have the right side problems,

00:07:12.718 --> 00:07:14.990
like ego and all that you should use the moon,

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.957
put the left hand towards the moon.

00:07:17.078 --> 00:07:19.216
But always people do the other way round

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:21.678
say these dramatic melodramatic people you see,

00:07:21.798 --> 00:07:24.499
all of them will go to the lunar side in them,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.769
they like the moonlight.

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:29.545
And those who are egoistical will go in the sun

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:31.292
and burn themselves off.

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:34.535
So other way round it should be.

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:39.507
Like that if you use, you can work it out. All right?

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.359
You yourself can manage it.

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.119
So these are different centers,

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:47.768
which must be cleansed and meditated onto

00:07:47.888 --> 00:07:51.312
and or to be dissolved into their own.

00:07:51.432 --> 00:07:55.744
I mean if you dissolve them into their own element,

00:07:55.864 --> 00:08:01.936
then you get more strength you see into that particular body.
