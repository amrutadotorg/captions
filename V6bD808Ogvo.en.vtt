00:07.460 --> 00:09.020
You see when you meditate;

00:09.143 --> 00:14.413
how do you meditate on different chakras?

00:16.024 --> 00:20.343
Say you have to meditate on Mooladhara,

00:21.383 --> 00:25.111
now you pay attention towards Mooladhara

00:29.967 --> 00:34.618
and take the name of Shri Ganesha. Say the mantra.

00:35.714 --> 00:39.227
You know there are four petals; so every…

00:39.347 --> 00:43.400
– that mantra should be every time should be four times should be said.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.412
Four into four you can say. Pay attention there.

00:50.126 --> 00:54.977
Now physically also say we have a Nabhi Chakra

00:55.097 --> 00:57.787
so many of you catch at Nabhi.

00:58.985 --> 01:01.394
If you have a liver problem,

01:02.410 --> 01:08.996
you can rub a little sugar on your Nabhi, will be a good idea.

01:09.725 --> 01:14.535
Or if you have the left hand side problem of Nabhi

01:14.820 --> 01:20.199
if you rub a little oil or ghee or something it will be a good idea.

01:20.319 --> 01:24.285
And then concentrate on that. Try to put attention on to that

01:24.405 --> 01:26.645
specially the chakras which are not all right.

01:26.765 --> 01:31.536
You just pay attention to it and meditate on them.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.653
Pay attention to it is the main point.

01:34.773 --> 01:38.560
If you pay attention with the mantras saying,

01:38.680 --> 01:42.072
that’s how you can meditate on every chakra.

01:42.192 --> 01:47.147
And if two people can do it, is a better idea.

01:47.268 --> 01:51.719
Is, you see, in your back, on your back;

01:51.839 --> 01:57.610
if you show the spinal chord, you can see what chakras are bulging out.

01:57.730 --> 02:01.862
Other person can tell you these are the portions which are bulging out.

02:01.982 --> 02:06.231
So you go on saying the mantras of that chakra paying attention

02:06.351 --> 02:09.770
and the other person can tell you whether it is all right or not.

02:09.890 --> 02:14.027
For every chakra there is a mantra, which you know.

02:14.147 --> 02:19.279
Apart from mantra, you must know what things should be used

02:19.399 --> 02:24.458
which element should be used for which chakra.

02:25.712 --> 02:30.601
For example, for using say, Mooladhara chakra,

02:30.722 --> 02:34.183
best way to clear out Mooladhara chakra is sit on the ground.

02:34.303 --> 02:38.353
It’s the best way. I’ve told you how to do the exercise

02:38.473 --> 02:41.256
to be able to sit on the ground straight,

02:41.376 --> 02:46.099
it’s very good idea of asking the mother earth

02:46.219 --> 02:48.770
to clear out your Mooladhara.

02:50.857 --> 02:55.895
For say example, if you have to clear out say your Nabhi,

02:56.015 --> 03:02.211
for Nabhi is made out of the water element

03:02.331 --> 03:07.819
and that’s why you have to ask the water element to help you.

03:07.939 --> 03:10.624
And for Nabhi water element is the best.

03:10.744 --> 03:14.102
If you can use the water element to clear your Nabhi,

03:14.222 --> 03:16.530
it will be a very good idea.

03:16.911 --> 03:22.201
Like that, every chakra is made from some element as it is.

03:22.321 --> 03:28.134
Swadisthana is made of earth and water;

03:28.325 --> 03:31.713
so the sea is the best for Swadhistana.

03:31.834 --> 03:35.073
If you could go to the sea and work out on Swadhisthana,

03:35.193 --> 03:36.668
will be the best for you.

03:36.788 --> 03:41.803
In the ocean or you can use salt and water for Swadhisthana;

03:41.923 --> 03:43.606
will be very good.

03:45.574 --> 03:51.922
Then we can say that for the heart chakra, heart chakra is,

03:52.042 --> 03:59.333
has to do with the, what you call, the akash.

04:01.803 --> 04:07.568
Firmament, with the firmament, this heart chakra is with the

04:08.250 --> 04:11.884
– ah, no not firmament, akash? Akash “ne”, [no in Hindi].

04:12.004 --> 04:20.491
It’s made out of air [Hindi mika he?] Air is called vayu, vayu is air.

04:20.611 --> 04:24.760
Air or you call it air as an element you call the word air?

04:24.880 --> 04:29.551
Or firmament? Firmament is ether, in English isn’t it?

04:29.671 --> 04:35.160
So air, you can say air, air element is for the heart chakra.

04:35.692 --> 04:41.411
So for that, I have told you how to do, I mean, breathing.

04:41.531 --> 04:46.083
Breathing is the best way of hold your breath before the photograph.

04:46.344 --> 04:50.849
Or you can take the breath in, deep breathing

04:50.969 --> 04:54.125
and releasing it for a longer period.

04:54.245 --> 04:57.136
Cleaning it, all these exercises are there.

04:57.256 --> 05:02.084
Then you see the mantra is of raksha, is the protection,

05:02.204 --> 05:06.876
to ask for the protection is all with the air. All right?

05:06.996 --> 05:13.882
Then we come to this one is here is the

05:46.630 --> 05:49.104
akash, must be firmament.

05:49.352 --> 05:52.506
What is a firmament in English?

05:53.776 --> 05:57.175
Ether? Firmament is ether? All right,

05:57.295 --> 06:00.485
so this is the firmament, you see,

06:00.605 --> 06:03.040
I read one translation but I was not sure.

06:03.160 --> 06:09.080
This is the akash, is the sky. This is the sky, here, all right?

06:09.200 --> 06:12.781
This is made out of the sky firmament

06:12.901 --> 06:16.020
and this is made out of the light. (Agya)

06:19.250 --> 06:27.280
Firmament is sky, is it? So this is sky;

06:28.192 --> 06:31.155
that’s why it is Virata this thing.

06:32.878 --> 06:36.604
And this is your light.

06:36.724 --> 06:39.253
So for Agnya chakra you have to use the light,

06:39.373 --> 06:41.298
for this you have to use the sky.

06:41.418 --> 06:44.456
If your hands put up like this if you say “Allah hu Akbar”

06:44.576 --> 06:48.149
put both the hands towards the sky. See like that.

06:48.269 --> 06:50.233
There are so many ways of using the sky,

06:50.353 --> 06:52.233
watching the sky, looking at the sky.

06:52.353 --> 06:57.763
And for this the sun and the light is to be used.

06:58.977 --> 07:02.522
Now supposing you are suffering from say left side problem,

07:02.642 --> 07:05.478
is sort of you’re possessed or something,

07:05.598 --> 07:07.631
then you can use the sun you see

07:07.751 --> 07:09.924
because the sun will give you balance.

07:10.044 --> 07:12.598
But if you have the right side problems,

07:12.718 --> 07:14.990
like ego and all that you should use the moon,

07:15.110 --> 07:16.957
put the left hand towards the moon.

07:17.078 --> 07:19.216
But always people do the other way round

07:19.336 --> 07:21.678
say these dramatic melodramatic people you see,

07:21.798 --> 07:24.499
all of them will go to the lunar side in them,

07:24.620 --> 07:26.769
they like the moonlight.

07:26.889 --> 07:29.545
And those who are egoistical will go in the sun

07:29.665 --> 07:31.292
and burn themselves off.

07:32.348 --> 07:34.535
So other way round it should be.

07:34.655 --> 07:39.507
Like that if you use, you can work it out. All right?

07:40.380 --> 07:42.359
You yourself can manage it.

07:42.479 --> 07:44.119
So these are different centers,

07:44.239 --> 07:47.768
which must be cleansed and meditated onto

07:47.888 --> 07:51.312
and or to be dissolved into their own.

07:51.432 --> 07:55.744
I mean if you dissolve them into their own element,

07:55.864 --> 08:01.936
then you get more strength you see into that particular body.
