Mahakali Puja Talk, Paris, France, 1993-0711

00:16.469 --> 00:24.823
Today we have decided to have the puja of the Devi.

00:27.546 --> 00:33.260
This time we are not talking about Adi Shakti,

00:33.460 --> 00:43.543
about Kundalini or about Saraswati, Mahalakshmi.

00:43.781 --> 00:49.653
We are talking about the Mahakali.

00:52.247 --> 01:01.931
That’s the Goddess which is the first one,

01:02.132 --> 01:05.662
which comes first

01:05.863 --> 01:15.481
and establishes Shri Ganesha,

01:15.682 --> 01:19.953
in the form of Gauri.

01:23.679 --> 01:37.093
She’s the complete form of Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

01:37.986 --> 01:45.704
Out of Her only these energies emit.

01:47.228 --> 01:58.727
So She’s the one who is the power of desire of God.

01:59.969 --> 02:05.774
Within us also She creates desires.

02:09.103 --> 02:21.340
These desires within us start emitting outside

02:21.540 --> 02:31.063
and we develop a kind of a reaction to all our desires.

02:35.860 --> 02:38.993
The first and foremost desire, as you know very much,

02:39.193 --> 02:44.311
the most primitive, is to feed yourself.

02:48.952 --> 02:56.057
And this is given to us by the Goddess.

02:56.257 --> 03:00.949
She gives us the desire to feed ourselves.

03:01.149 --> 03:05.363
Now if we don’t feed ourselves, then we cannot survive.

03:05.563 --> 03:15.456
We have to have food. It is very
important that we should feed ourselves

03:15.656 --> 03:20.018
sufficiently enough to exist on this Earth.

03:20.218 --> 03:23.213
And also we have seen that

03:23.413 --> 03:34.120
when this kind of desire grows very much more than normal,

03:34.321 --> 03:43.674
then you become slaves of this desire

03:43.874 --> 03:49.363
and any amount of food cannot satisfy you.

03:49.563 --> 03:54.508
All the time you think of nothing else but food.

03:56.039 --> 03:59.285
I have told you many a times that the French

03:59.485 --> 04:02.375
are very particular as to what they should eat.

04:02.584 --> 04:05.990
You see, they take at least forty-five minutes on a dinner table

04:06.190 --> 04:10.967
to decide what they will eat.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.975
Ultimately, it’s just the same. I mean, I don’t understand

04:15.175 --> 04:21.124
how can you need forty-five minutes to decide what you want to eat?

04:21.324 --> 04:28.073
But this desire starts acting through your ego.

04:28.273 --> 04:40.049
So it satisfies you. And also those
people who are manufacturing food

04:40.249 --> 04:43.721
or who are supplying food in hotels and all that

04:43.921 --> 04:48.012
know how to satisfy your desires.

04:48.212 --> 04:50.559
So they bring it in a way, show it round

04:50.759 --> 04:54.848
and then place it before you, so that you approve of it

04:55.048 --> 04:59.239
and when you approve of it then they serve.

04:59.439 --> 05:05.432
They know how to befool you and you
feel quite happy, "Oh, it’s very good.“

05:07.135 --> 05:10.716
Even the wine is given for testing first of all

05:10.916 --> 05:13.161
and, whether you like it or not, you have to say it’s very good

05:13.361 --> 05:18.902
and you better show that you like it.

05:19.102 --> 05:26.654
So this desire gets completely controlled by your ego

05:26.854 --> 05:33.381
and when it becomes a kind of a collective desire

05:33.581 --> 05:38.919
and a collective ego expression,

05:39.119 --> 05:43.403
then we become like gluttons, you see.

05:43.603 --> 05:46.543
I would say sophisticated.

05:46.743 --> 05:51.284
They’re sophisticated, but we are gluttons.

05:51.485 --> 05:55.238
Now with that, other things also people want to have,

05:55.438 --> 06:02.952
like proper sort of a table lying and linen, this, that.

06:03.460 --> 06:08.620
Of course, if ego is not there,

06:08.820 --> 06:17.593
then people would like to see to please others by feeding them.

06:18.499 --> 06:22.049
This desire reacts.

06:22.249 --> 06:26.299
And then the new desire comes in

06:26.499 --> 06:29.776
through the blessings of the Mahakali

06:29.976 --> 06:36.424
that you like to see others eating the food.

06:36.624 --> 06:39.974
You enjoy when others eat the food cooked by you,

06:40.174 --> 06:43.420
served by you, given by you.

06:43.620 --> 06:49.244
Just want to watch. That gives you satisfaction.

06:49.444 --> 06:54.119
But food, to any extent you may go, you will never be satisfied.

06:54.319 --> 06:58.436
Today you will ask for this, tomorrow for that, this, that.

06:58.636 --> 07:02.217
Now, in the Western life today, it has become very important

07:02.417 --> 07:05.983
to ask a child every day, "What will you have?"

07:06.183 --> 07:09.386
In olden days the food was cooked for all the family.

07:09.586 --> 07:12.222
Everybody would eat the same food.

07:12.422 --> 07:15.737
But now you must ask the child, "What will you have?"

07:15.937 --> 07:18.190
Then the child has to say, "I’ll have this."

07:18.390 --> 07:23.042
Now, supposing you don’t have that
in your fridge, you are finished.

07:23.242 --> 07:27.510
Early in the morning there will be no shop open, nothing.

07:27.710 --> 07:30.344
How will you please that boy in his ego

07:30.545 --> 07:33.100
because he wants a particular thing?

07:33.300 --> 07:38.345
So gradually we build up even the ego of our children.

07:38.545 --> 07:42.845
We have to say, "This is cooked, this is nice and you eat this."

07:43.045 --> 07:46.782
Is the duty of parents not to allow children

07:46.982 --> 07:52.197
to grow their ego by what they want.

07:52.397 --> 07:55.158
You should know what they have to have.

07:55.358 --> 07:58.959
Then it starts growing and growing and growing

07:59.159 --> 08:07.263
till they become quite grown up, but very primitive.

08:07.463 --> 08:11.542
So, actually, the blessing of the Devi on this point is that

08:11.742 --> 08:18.461
She gives you a desire that you should serve others.

08:19.296 --> 08:23.854
Also you then get concerned about people who are starving,

08:24.054 --> 08:28.382
want to find out why they are starving.

08:28.654 --> 08:32.353
The another extreme of this could be that some people think

08:32.553 --> 08:40.613
we should not eat so much, a kind of a sacrificing nonsense.

08:40.813 --> 08:45.004
Whatever one has to eat, one should eat.

08:45.204 --> 08:47.721
Then they say, "Why should we eat so much, Mother?

08:47.921 --> 08:50.994
After all, there are people who are starving."

08:51.194 --> 08:54.189
By your eating less or more,

08:54.389 --> 08:57.150
you cannot save those who are starving, can you?

08:57.350 --> 09:00.522
So there’s no wisdom in this kind of austerity.

09:00.722 --> 09:06.100
And when the people enter into this kind of austerity,

09:06.300 --> 09:10.088
then they have sufferings and troubles

09:10.288 --> 09:14.689
and such people become extremely, I should say, ascetic

09:14.889 --> 09:18.455
and hot-tempered and you should never go near to a person

09:18.655 --> 09:21.493
who is of that kind without a barge pole.

09:21.694 --> 09:25.048
God knows when he will jump on you.

09:25.248 --> 09:27.456
So a person who is hungry is

09:27.657 --> 09:30.866
as bad as a person who is overfed.

09:31.067 --> 09:35.230
I think hungry is worse.

09:35.522 --> 09:39.366
Now if you look at yourself, the second desire

09:39.567 --> 09:48.474
that comes to you is that everyone should love you.

09:49.820 --> 09:58.584
This comes because that makes you good person.

09:58.784 --> 10:01.998
You know that everybody likes goodness.

10:02.198 --> 10:06.412
So people try to be good to others, nice to others,

10:06.612 --> 10:09.237
say a hundred times thank you,

10:09.437 --> 10:12.432
do all kinds of things to please others.

10:12.632 --> 10:19.185
By pleasing others, they think others will like us very much.

10:19.385 --> 10:24.599
But then it develops again out of bounds

10:24.799 --> 10:28.778
and then all the time you try to please others

10:28.978 --> 10:32.429
so that you become absolutely slavish.

10:32.630 --> 10:36.420
You become so artificial that people can make out

10:36.621 --> 10:39.047
that it’s nothing natural with this gentleman.

10:39.247 --> 10:42.445
He’s just trying to please us.

10:42.645 --> 10:47.929
Now, with that, the pleasing behind

10:48.129 --> 10:53.542
is some sort of an advantage out of it.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.678
If you please another one with a detached mind,

10:58.878 --> 11:03.232
not expecting anything, that should be done for you

11:03.432 --> 11:06.407
or that could be achieved through that pleasing.

11:06.607 --> 11:09.142
It’s very pure pleasing and it’s very good.

11:09.342 --> 11:11.830
That makes you really righteous and good.

11:12.030 --> 11:15.025
But supposing you try to please others

11:15.225 --> 11:19.221
only just to take advantage of that person,

11:19.421 --> 11:25.787
then you develop hypocrisy, hypocrisy of the worst type.

11:29.958 --> 11:32.414
And you get lost.

11:32.614 --> 11:35.078
People mock at you, laugh at you. They’re never pleased.

11:35.278 --> 11:39.303
They know that you are a hypocrite and you’re doing it

11:39.504 --> 11:43.656
for some sort of an advantage or an exploitation.

11:43.856 --> 11:49.483
You are not doing it because you
want to be good really, to be nice.

11:49.684 --> 11:54.024
A person who is good, automatically pleases others.

11:54.224 --> 11:57.266
But he doesn’t try to please.

11:57.466 --> 12:02.390
He’s just – his nature is such, his temperament is such

12:02.590 --> 12:06.119
that he just pleases people.

12:06.319 --> 12:11.416
This, when taken over again by Mister Ego,

12:11.616 --> 12:16.181
then really you can’t beat it. Then they become diplomats.

12:16.382 --> 12:22.249
You see, could be politicians, all
these doomed classes, they become

12:22.449 --> 12:24.616
and they cannot get out of it.

12:24.816 --> 12:28.538
They get so much used to it, that they cannot get out of it.

12:28.738 --> 12:35.069
Now what does the Devi do? She brings the truth before them.

12:35.269 --> 12:37.905
She shows that what you have been doing

12:38.105 --> 12:42.116
for a particular exploitation doesn’t work out.

12:42.316 --> 12:46.187
After a point it does. She exposes them.

12:46.387 --> 12:50.625
The exposure starts and with that exposure, they’re surprised,

12:50.825 --> 12:57.175
"How am I exposed? How am I caught, how people know?"

12:58.402 --> 13:03.264
This is the job of the power of Mahakali.

13:03.464 --> 13:08.607
She exposes all that is wrong, all that is falsehood,

13:08.807 --> 13:12.513
that is untruth, She exposes.

13:12.713 --> 13:19.405
Then the third desire people have is to possess material things,

13:19.605 --> 13:25.343
from which materialism has come.
But there’s no end to it.

13:25.543 --> 13:28.726
End can never come because

13:28.926 --> 13:32.749
they have no satisfaction in getting one thing.

13:32.949 --> 13:35.154
Supposing today I want to have this carpet.

13:35.354 --> 13:38.795
All right, I’ll get this one. Then I want to have another one.

13:38.995 --> 13:42.160
Then I want to have another one. Then I want to have a car

13:42.361 --> 13:44.411
and then I want to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane.

13:44.612 --> 13:49.345
I don’t know what I want to have then.
So it goes on and on and on and on

13:49.546 --> 13:53.604
until you reach a time where people start thinking,

13:53.804 --> 13:55.804
"What’s the matter with him?"

13:56.005 --> 13:59.979
And you cannot enjoy anything that you get.

14:00.179 --> 14:02.734
This is also a human failing

14:02.934 --> 14:07.390
and this human failing creates economics, you know that.

14:07.590 --> 14:13.971
Economics is created because wants, in general, are not satiable.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.927
They are not satiable.

14:17.127 --> 14:19.122
So what happens? We go on from jumping from one

14:19.322 --> 14:22.295
to another to another to another and another.

14:22.495 --> 14:28.725
So then you become slaves of entrepreneurs

14:28.925 --> 14:35.158
so much so, that you lose your individuality completely.

14:35.358 --> 14:42.476
For example, an entrepreneur produces
a funny kind of a dress, one year.

14:42.676 --> 14:46.781
So everybody wants to wear the same

14:46.981 --> 14:50.421
without thinking if it is necessary or not.

14:50.621 --> 14:55.509
Then he brings in another form.

14:55.709 --> 15:00.243
Next year everything is given up, buy the another one.

15:00.443 --> 15:07.652
Third year another one. So pile of all these clothes are there

15:07.852 --> 15:11.816
and nicely the manufacturer has become a great man of designs,

15:12.016 --> 15:15.400
his very good designs, how to befool human beings.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.978
He has become a rich man and you have become poor

15:18.178 --> 15:25.463
with all this kind of clothes which has no meaning for you anymore.

15:25.663 --> 15:30.764
About the same thing, about everything, something is fashionable.

15:31.819 --> 15:34.885
That means you have no individuality.

15:35.085 --> 15:37.198
We talk of individuality,

15:37.398 --> 15:41.049
but we want to do things which everybody’s doing.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.078
I mean, you know that all kinds of absurd things people have done

15:44.278 --> 15:47.461
in the name of fashion

15:47.661 --> 15:51.172
and specially people who are traditionally bound,

15:51.372 --> 15:55.088
who have had no traditions like Americans, I would say.

15:55.288 --> 15:59.634
They go on changing after every six months.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.784
Every year you go, you find a new type of people there,

16:03.984 --> 16:06.784
new type of clothes.

16:06.984 --> 16:09.964
It’s very surprising how they change so fast

16:10.164 --> 16:14.523
without even thinking whether this will suit me or not.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.554
Somebody says wear tight clothes, they’ll go with tight clothes.

16:17.754 --> 16:22.390
Then they develop varicose veins, so they wear with the holes.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.644
Then they develop some other problem,

16:25.845 --> 16:28.001
then they wear another kind.

16:28.202 --> 16:32.767
Nobody wants to think, "Why should I change my dress?"

16:32.967 --> 16:37.591
Like, say, in India we wear saris, finished.

16:37.791 --> 16:42.451
Nothing there. No problem with the tailor, nothing doing.

16:42.651 --> 16:45.041
Whatever sari we like, we’ll buy.

16:45.241 --> 16:49.166
And a sari came called as mini sari in India,

16:49.366 --> 16:52.254
which was up to here maybe, I don’t know, not six inches,

16:52.454 --> 16:55.115
but at least up to the knee.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.959
It came for about, I think, eight, seven days in Bombay

16:59.159 --> 17:03.955
and went back. People said, "Get lost. We don’t want it."

17:05.546 --> 17:12.291
So this headache of all the time getting into a fashion

17:12.491 --> 17:19.011
like horse without any sense in the head

17:19.211 --> 17:23.828
has to be understood properly.

17:25.005 --> 17:27.517
Why people do it? Because they have no brains.

17:27.717 --> 17:31.275
They’re brainless people.

17:31.475 --> 17:36.861
They’re not intelligent to see that we are befooled every year.

17:37.061 --> 17:42.393
But, for Sahaja Yogis, the Mahakali power works

17:42.593 --> 17:50.705
and She teaches them that "All right,
this dress suits you. Have this one."

17:50.905 --> 17:53.166
And it’s the best for you.

17:53.366 --> 17:57.315
Once for all, your lifelong problem is solved.

17:57.515 --> 18:02.109
With this kind of blouse, I started wearing from the very beginning perhaps

18:02.309 --> 18:07.801
and I’ve been wearing it and now I find everybody wears the same style.

18:09.184 --> 18:12.266
Why to waste your energy in changing every day this blouse

18:12.466 --> 18:17.298
starting from here to here, to here and going back again like this? You see.

18:17.498 --> 18:22.825
It’s such a waste of energy, such a waste of cloth.

18:23.025 --> 18:25.996
And we make ourselves so cheap running with the race

18:26.196 --> 18:29.903
of reducing the sleeves, reducing this, reducing that,

18:30.103 --> 18:33.118
all increasing.

18:34.306 --> 18:43.588
Is all a desire to impress people that we are very up to date.

18:44.283 --> 18:47.809
Who wants to know?

18:48.009 --> 18:53.518
Who wants to find out that you are up to date or not?

18:54.167 --> 19:00.225
And we have no courage to keep to
our own dress that we have purchased.

19:00.425 --> 19:03.022
Why to waste so much money? We don’t even think.

19:03.222 --> 19:08.475
Go on changing, changing, changing for nothing at all.

19:08.675 --> 19:12.222
So this is desire is there to impress others

19:12.422 --> 19:16.211
with our outside things.

19:16.711 --> 19:22.364
So many thing like dress there are, which we try to impress.

19:23.794 --> 19:27.973
Now, hairstyle.

19:29.450 --> 19:32.860
I read an article. They said that

19:33.060 --> 19:38.430
these hairstyles are responsible for many divorces.

19:38.630 --> 19:41.388
I was wondering, "How can it be hairstyles

19:41.589 --> 19:44.391
responsible for divorces?"

19:44.592 --> 19:47.650
Because they had made a survey.

19:47.850 --> 19:52.869
A man had liked a hairstyle of his fiancée

19:53.069 --> 19:58.311
and then she changed her hairstyle, so he divorced her.

19:59.546 --> 20:02.181
And the other way round.

20:02.381 --> 20:05.275
When it is so cheap way of disposing of

20:05.475 --> 20:10.256
such a deep relationship of husband and wife.

20:17.395 --> 20:21.082
Now certain facts start.

20:21.282 --> 20:28.457
I also saw one documentary about a lady

20:28.657 --> 20:34.172
who’d said that it was in one of the advertisements,

20:34.373 --> 20:36.800
something, sort of a thing appeared that your legs should be

20:37.000 --> 20:42.469
of this shape and what you should do.

20:42.669 --> 20:45.716
So poor thing spent so much time, energy,

20:45.917 --> 20:47.786
ran up and down to make the legs.

20:47.987 --> 20:51.039
I mean what is the importance of these legs, except for walking?

20:51.239 --> 20:54.281
So she went to make the shape like that.

20:54.481 --> 20:59.375
She used to measure it, would be always something missing here and there.

20:59.575 --> 21:03.196
Then many people joined. They had a class for it.

21:03.396 --> 21:07.826
And a group joined to make legs like that.

21:08.026 --> 21:14.503
And, ultimately, they found out that that leg was made out of wood.

21:15.821 --> 21:18.910
And they spent so much money, so much energy

21:19.110 --> 21:23.321
to make legs like that. For what?

21:23.797 --> 21:27.269
What is the purpose?

21:27.469 --> 21:31.449
If anybody says, "You run like this," they start running.

21:31.649 --> 21:37.517
They say, "Jump like this," they start jumping. But why?

21:38.283 --> 21:40.864
Have we gone all nuts in our heads

21:41.064 --> 21:45.989
that we should accept whatever one says, we start doing that.

21:46.189 --> 21:49.442
What is the purpose?

21:49.643 --> 21:53.185
So this kind of stupidity comes in our heads

21:53.385 --> 21:55.685
when we start using our ego.

21:55.885 --> 22:01.354
With the ego a person becomes absolutely stupid.

22:01.906 --> 22:12.538
Because he’ll say, "What’s wrong? What’s wrong if I,

22:12.739 --> 22:19.192
if I have just a little hair here? What’s wrong?

22:19.392 --> 22:29.833
If I just try to wear a very short dress here, what’s wrong?"

22:30.333 --> 22:34.664
The wrong is why are you wearing?

22:34.864 --> 22:39.870
Why don’t you ask a question? Why are you wearing?

22:40.070 --> 22:44.433
If you ask a question to yourself, "Why do I have this kind of hairstyle?"

22:44.633 --> 22:48.671
"Why do I do like this?"

22:49.101 --> 22:53.284
It is really difficult to tell people to do right things,

22:53.484 --> 22:57.893
but wrong things people take to like that.

22:58.093 --> 23:03.454
For example, I told everyone that you put oil, if not every day,

23:03.655 --> 23:08.034
just before bath, a lot of oil in your hair and wash.

23:08.234 --> 23:12.512
Now I find many people getting bald.

23:13.129 --> 23:17.851
But they didn’t put the oil. What can I do about it?

23:18.051 --> 23:23.546
But such a simple thing they won’t have.

23:24.155 --> 23:27.150
Such a simple thing they would not believe,

23:27.350 --> 23:30.270
that you need something for your nourishment.

23:30.470 --> 23:33.567
But they will do something which is absurd,

23:33.767 --> 23:40.901
nonsensical without even thinking, "What is going to harm us."

23:41.893 --> 23:45.349
Here the Mahakali, what does She do?

23:45.549 --> 23:48.677
She punishes you.

23:48.877 --> 23:53.748
Your body is punished. If you wear very tight clothes,

23:53.948 --> 23:57.123
you develop problems of your legs.

23:57.323 --> 24:04.271
If you wear holey pants, then you get cramps.

24:04.471 --> 24:09.097
Anything you do abnormal, you have to pay for it.

24:09.297 --> 24:11.792
First you have to pay for doing it

24:11.992 --> 24:16.953
and then you have to pay for it physically.

24:17.414 --> 24:23.229
So many things can be avoided if we just had a simple life,

24:23.429 --> 24:26.002
decide once for all that

24:26.202 --> 24:31.740
"I will have this kind of dress for this lifetime, finished."

24:33.490 --> 24:38.275
Every day to change, itself, is a headache.

24:38.475 --> 24:43.084
But that satisfied the ego, not your Self.

24:44.053 --> 24:51.282
So the Mahalaxmi Principle in us raises higher and higher.

24:51.482 --> 24:55.966
Despite that, we are pulled down.

24:56.818 --> 25:02.411
Then this Mahakali, She comes forward

25:02.611 --> 25:07.083
and shows what wrong we have done,

25:07.283 --> 25:14.751
how we have gone wrong,
how we have missed the point.

25:16.189 --> 25:23.746
Instead of thinking what is wrong,
She teaches you, "It is wrong."

25:25.488 --> 25:28.540
Then another thing She does, which is a very beautiful thing She does,

25:28.740 --> 25:35.524
I think sometimes, that She creates an illusion

25:35.724 --> 25:41.365
to test your intelligence, to test your sensibility.

25:41.565 --> 25:45.841
She creates an illusion. Branti rupena samstita.

25:46.041 --> 25:50.829
She makes a branti in your head. Illusion.

25:51.029 --> 25:53.978
So you become illusive

25:54.178 --> 25:58.774
or others become illusive or a situation becomes illusive.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.930
And you are lost in it.

26:02.130 --> 26:09.094
Then you really understand that it’s wrong thing I have done.

26:09.294 --> 26:13.622
It’s a very nice story about Narada.

26:13.822 --> 26:19.732
Narada was under an impression about himself

26:19.932 --> 26:25.016
and ultimately he became ego-oriented and he started saying,

26:25.217 --> 26:28.994
"Oh, look at me. I am never enticed by any woman.

26:29.194 --> 26:33.494
Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid. I am never enticed.

26:33.694 --> 26:38.610
I am the highest of highest, Brahmachari."

26:38.810 --> 26:46.424
So Vishnu sent two gandharvas to entice him.

26:46.624 --> 26:49.440
So they met him in a forest and told him,

26:49.640 --> 26:52.666
"Oh, Narada, you are such a handsome man,

26:52.866 --> 26:56.667
such a beautiful man and all your beauty’s wasted.

26:56.867 --> 26:59.222
You must test your beauty. You must see how beautiful you are.

26:59.422 --> 27:02.425
You’re so handsome."

27:02.625 --> 27:05.324
He said, "Really?" "Yes. There’s a very simple way of testing you."

27:05.524 --> 27:10.417
"It’s how?" They said, "There’s a

27:10.617 --> 27:14.378
wedding coming up of a very beautiful woman.

27:14.578 --> 27:23.920
She is the princess of the beauty city, is called Roop Nagar,

27:24.120 --> 27:28.819
and you should go there and see how she will appreciate you.

27:29.019 --> 27:35.850
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he went there.

27:36.050 --> 27:40.030
And he was sitting and lots of people were coming,

27:40.230 --> 27:43.097
big big maharajas, rajas, all of them were sitting

27:43.298 --> 27:47.975
and he was thinking, "Oh, I’m the
best among all of them. Who are these?

27:48.175 --> 27:51.370
The princess will just garland me, no doubt about it."

27:51.570 --> 27:57.456
And these two were putting that illusion in his head, branti.

27:57.656 --> 28:01.374
With the Agnya, you get branti.

28:01.574 --> 28:06.788
This princess came round. She
looked at him and she laughed aloud.

28:06.988 --> 28:10.883
She couldn’t control herself and she moved on giggling.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.414
He couldn’t understand why she laughed at him.

28:13.614 --> 28:18.000
She didn’t garland him or nothing but she just laughed.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.702
So he couldn’t understand, "I’m such a handsome man," this thing.

28:21.902 --> 28:25.225
So these two gandharvas told him, "Oh, it doesn’t matter.

28:25.425 --> 28:28.936
You see, she doesn’t understand. She’ll come back," this, that.

28:29.136 --> 28:32.420
Then they went out and near a lake and he sat down

28:32.620 --> 28:37.186
to wash his face and looked at in the water his reflection.

28:37.386 --> 28:41.840
He looked like a monkey.

28:42.777 --> 28:45.148
He looked at these two and he cursed them.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.386
He said, "I look like a monkey."

28:47.587 --> 28:51.067
Said, "To us, you look like very handsome."

28:51.267 --> 28:55.528
"But I really look like a monkey."

28:55.728 --> 29:02.422
So this branti, this illusion was created in his mind by his ego.

29:02.622 --> 29:05.751
But this power, itself, Mahakali’s power,

29:05.951 --> 29:13.209
She puts this ego right by creating illusion, branti.

29:15.725 --> 29:22.347
And this is responsible for many illusions we run after.

29:22.547 --> 29:28.602
It’s a mirage, running after it, running after it.

29:29.362 --> 29:34.068
Once we are satisfied within ourselves,

29:34.268 --> 29:40.307
then we don’t run after mirages.

29:40.854 --> 29:43.056
This illusion, if it would not be created,

29:43.256 --> 29:48.971
people would be so egoistical that whole world will be finished.

29:49.905 --> 29:55.791
So this is the great work of Mahakali Power within us,

29:55.991 --> 29:59.573
that She creates illusions.

29:59.773 --> 30:02.487
Many people talk of maya. "This is Mother, maya.

30:02.687 --> 30:06.151
This is maya. That is maya."

30:06.351 --> 30:09.302
Is the work of Mahakali.

30:09.502 --> 30:12.830
She wants to test you.

30:13.135 --> 30:21.023
She wants to test you. But in Sahaja Yoga it’s not such a strong one.

30:21.223 --> 30:24.258
For example, you know Abraham had a son.

30:24.458 --> 30:28.867
One son he had after a long time.

30:29.067 --> 30:33.596
And God asked him that he should sacrifice his son.

30:33.796 --> 30:36.413
His wife said also was feeling terrible that

30:36.614 --> 30:40.089
he has to sacrifice his son.

30:40.290 --> 30:46.254
So he went down to the place where the child was to be sacrificed.

30:46.454 --> 30:50.259
He made a fire, everything and was about to put the child

30:50.459 --> 30:55.813
on that pyre of fire when the voice came.

30:56.013 --> 30:59.972
This is Mahakali,

31:00.172 --> 31:04.946
that you don’t have to sacrifice your child.

31:05.469 --> 31:08.949
We have many such stories in Indian mythology also

31:09.149 --> 31:12.934
where they were tested.

31:13.134 --> 31:20.126
So to test Sahaja Yogis also, this Mahakali helps you.

31:21.682 --> 31:26.130
There was a gentleman who was very egoistical,

31:26.330 --> 31:28.771
so I told him to come to Delhi

31:28.971 --> 31:32.300
because I didn’t know how to do it here.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.667
He came to Delhi and he told everybody, "See,

31:34.867 --> 31:38.277
Mother told me to come here just to cure Her."

31:38.477 --> 31:43.257
I said, "All right." He came. I said, "What’s wrong with Me?"

31:43.457 --> 31:46.335
He said, "Mother, Your Nabhi is very bad." I said, "Really?

31:46.535 --> 31:49.585
Acha, you put a bandhan to yourself and now see for yourself."

31:49.785 --> 31:52.115
"Oh my God, you see, what’s happening to me here?"

31:52.315 --> 31:56.246
I said, "That’s My Nabhi."

31:56.446 --> 32:00.168
So this is how the illusion corrects you.

32:00.368 --> 32:04.353
If there is no illusion, you would not ever be corrected directly.

32:04.553 --> 32:09.649
Supposing I say, "Don’t do this." You may not like.

32:09.849 --> 32:15.233
Of yourse, mostly you like, but sometimes you don’t.

32:15.433 --> 32:20.201
And then the illusion works and then you realize,

32:20.401 --> 32:26.093
"Where was I and where am I now? I should not have done this.

32:26.293 --> 32:29.601
How is it I have landed into this problem?

32:29.801 --> 32:34.177
What has made me so stupid?"

32:34.377 --> 32:39.158
So this is something which She does.

32:39.924 --> 32:45.314
Another is She’s the one who relaxes you completely.

32:45.514 --> 32:51.765
When you are tired and fed up, when you don’t know what to do,

32:51.965 --> 32:57.578
then She makes you sleep. She’s the one who gives you sleep.

32:57.778 --> 33:00.398
All day’s work you do,

33:00.598 --> 33:05.959
ultimately the Mahakali power acts on you as sleep.

33:06.159 --> 33:10.732
She makes you sleep, sleep like a child.

33:10.932 --> 33:15.636
You know, at that time, all that wrong we have done to ourselves

33:15.836 --> 33:19.444
and to others are forgiven.

33:19.644 --> 33:22.333
In Her lap we sleep nicely,

33:22.534 --> 33:28.631
quietly and all our problems are solved.

33:29.852 --> 33:38.434
In those dreams, when you are, She brings forth solutions to you.

33:38.634 --> 33:41.741
I know so many people told Me, "Mother, you came in my dream

33:41.941 --> 33:45.850
and told me that this is the medicine you should take.

33:46.050 --> 33:49.249
You came in my dream and You told me that

33:49.449 --> 33:54.344
this particular type of life will suit you."

33:54.544 --> 33:58.571
They see Me clearly coming, but there it is not whole of Me,

33:58.771 --> 34:02.663
but I think the Mahakali Power acts.

34:02.863 --> 34:08.686
Into very deep sleep you are, it is called, at the Sushupti.

34:08.886 --> 34:13.374
There She appears. One lady came to me and she said,

34:13.574 --> 34:16.558
"Mother, You came in the dream and you said that

34:16.759 --> 34:20.371
I’m here in Bombay. Nobody told me."

34:20.571 --> 34:22.953
So so many things happen like this.

34:23.153 --> 34:28.914
In the dream She guides you and tells you.

34:29.114 --> 34:31.578
Now what happens sometimes,

34:31.778 --> 34:34.865
people tell Me that I had such and such dream,

34:35.065 --> 34:37.979
which is all falsehood, I know.

34:38.179 --> 34:41.510
They never dreamt like that. They never saw like this.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.920
But, just to impress Me, they tell Me that,

34:44.120 --> 34:47.938
"Oh, I had a dream," this, that.

34:48.138 --> 34:52.599
I just show complete ignorance. I ask, "Must be?"

34:53.651 --> 34:57.873
Then they are put into again branti, means illusion.

34:58.073 --> 35:03.252
Gradually, they realize that

35:03.452 --> 35:07.960
it was wrong to tell lies to Mother.

35:08.655 --> 35:12.541
So the correction part takes place,

35:12.741 --> 35:16.767
but the greatest thing that She does

35:16.967 --> 35:24.920
is to give you the sense of chastity and security.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.725
When the children are born, they have sense of chastity,

35:28.925 --> 35:33.696
shame, decency, decorous behaviour.

35:33.896 --> 35:36.829
But gradually, when they start others misbehaving,

35:37.029 --> 35:43.208
they start misbehaving. To them, decency becomes a bondage.

35:43.953 --> 35:47.371
But, naturally, She’s there to tell you that

35:47.571 --> 35:52.527
"This is indecent. You shouldn’t do it. This is wrong.

35:52.727 --> 35:56.078
This is not the proper thing to do."

35:56.278 --> 35:59.102
But gradually, you grow up and mature,

35:59.302 --> 36:03.380
then you go, "What’s wrong?"

36:04.134 --> 36:10.168
You start disrespecting your chastity

36:10.368 --> 36:18.034
and you start becoming like immature, stupid people.

36:18.234 --> 36:25.399
All this, if is understood through meditation,

36:25.599 --> 36:29.235
the Mahakali helps you a lot.

36:29.435 --> 36:36.724
In meditation, She helps you a lot,
because She’s the one who creates

36:36.924 --> 36:41.349
the proper passage for Kundalini to rise.

36:41.549 --> 36:45.366
Mahakali is the same as the Kundalini

36:45.566 --> 36:51.350
because She is the residual energy of Mahakali Power,

36:51.550 --> 36:56.529
full of it there. But the function is different.

36:56.729 --> 37:00.951
The function of Mahakali is to protect you,

37:01.151 --> 37:05.222
is to guide you, to give you wisdom.

37:05.422 --> 37:09.190
And the function of the Kundalini is to cleanse you,

37:09.390 --> 37:13.050
to clear it out, not to play about with you,

37:13.250 --> 37:18.763
to forgive you and help you to grow properly.

37:18.963 --> 37:22.419
Now in your life, as Sahaja Yogis, you will see

37:22.619 --> 37:26.586
how Mahakali helps you in every way.

37:26.786 --> 37:30.399
It is so interesting to watch Her work,

37:30.599 --> 37:37.320
how She brings forth all kinds of satisfactions to you.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.031
The greed goes away. The temptations go away.

37:41.231 --> 37:45.019
The temper goes away. All these things disappear.

37:45.220 --> 37:49.515
The most helpful thing She does,

37:49.715 --> 37:54.505
that you get rid of your bad habits. Absolutely.

37:54.705 --> 37:59.216
Automatically, in the light of Mahakali’s power,

37:59.416 --> 38:06.666
you just do not want anything destructive to be practised.

38:06.866 --> 38:13.052
If you have been practising anything
destructive, you try to get rid of it.

38:13.252 --> 38:15.982
Just you stop it. "I don’t want to have it."

38:16.182 --> 38:18.865
I never tell you, "Don’t do this. Don’t do that."

38:19.065 --> 38:21.871
It’s the Mahakali power within you which is awakened,

38:22.071 --> 38:26.059
does all these things. And She has made you so beautiful,

38:26.259 --> 38:33.327
so angelic. She has, by Her corrections and by Her illusions,

38:33.527 --> 38:35.749
She has made you like this.

38:35.949 --> 38:44.708
So you don’t get so much attached to money, to greed, to lust,

38:44.908 --> 38:51.504
all these things which are responsible for putting you down.

38:51.704 --> 38:55.965
Also possessiveness for children, possessiveness for husband,

38:56.165 --> 38:58.785
possessiveness of matter.

38:58.985 --> 39:03.509
You just start understanding that the joy is in sharing.

39:03.709 --> 39:09.064
You want to share everything with others and that sharing starts

39:09.264 --> 39:15.538
when these Mahakali Powers start giving you blessings

39:15.738 --> 39:21.054
of joy, of sharing,

39:21.254 --> 39:29.037
of being collective, of being pure.

39:29.237 --> 39:35.326
These blessings come to you from the Mahalakshmi Power, Mahakali Power.

39:35.527 --> 39:38.951
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali power.

39:39.151 --> 39:41.807
May God bless you.
