1
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:22,891
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:33,284
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

3
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:45,106
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

4
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,770
and the wind was blowing from all sides

5
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:57,330
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

6
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:05,511
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

7
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:12,746
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

8
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:20,666
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

9
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:25,039
that He must have felt.

10
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:30,411
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

11
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:36,619
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

12
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,749
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

13
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,962
When our attention is on our Spirit,

14
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:59,704
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

15
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:08,006
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

16
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:14,089
complaining about comforts,

17
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:20,161
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

18
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:31,128
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

19
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:41,332
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

20
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:48,964
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

21
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:55,827
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

22
00:08:56,028 --> 00:09:01,032
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

23
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:05,622
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

24
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:08,013
and that goes to My credit, I think,

25
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:16,073
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

26
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:22,172
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

27
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:31,245
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

28
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,936
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

29
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:44,949
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

30
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:49,855
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

31
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:55,853
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

32
00:09:56,054 --> 00:10:02,457
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

33
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:08,429
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

34
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,222
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

35
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:16,884
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

36
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:22,624
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

37
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:28,323
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

38
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:31,928
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

39
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:38,763
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

40
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:43,040
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

41
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:49,407
as we say, is the light,

42
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:57,320
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

43
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:05,112
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

44
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:13,388
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

45
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:22,031
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

46
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:28,760
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

47
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:35,277
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

48
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:42,336
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

49
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:47,212
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

50
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:52,467
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

51
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:59,612
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

52
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:04,282
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

53
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:08,412
can be born in a manger,

54
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:13,036
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

55
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:21,448
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

56
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:28,677
we should make ourselves miserable

57
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:35,685
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

58
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:40,472
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

59
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:45,273
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

60
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:53,899
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

61
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,112
That's the main point.

62
00:12:56,313 --> 00:13:02,042
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

63
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:05,045
then He gives you hundred times more.

64
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:09,209
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

65
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,862
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

66
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:16,891
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

67
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:21,232
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

68
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:27,016
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

69
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:34,746
no material well-being, as we call it.

70
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:44,140
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

71
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:51,227
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

72
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:56,912
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

73
00:13:57,113 --> 00:14:01,433
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

74
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,229
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

75
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:15,357
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

76
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:23,138
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

77
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:27,602
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

78
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:35,175
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

79
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:38,606
and in that evaluation

80
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:46,694
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

81
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:53,464
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

82
00:14:53,665 --> 00:15:00,662
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

83
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:06,009
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

84
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,077
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

85
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,518
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

86
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:19,045
because they are not your relations.

87
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:22,695
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

88
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:29,650
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

89
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:36,163
just give them up on this point.

90
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,332
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

91
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,864
that we must forgive.

92
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:50,228
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

93
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:54,321
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

94
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:58,882
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

95
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:04,518
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

96
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:11,060
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

97
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:20,228
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

98
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:30,274
His life has been a story of spirituality,

99
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:35,904
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

100
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:41,148
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

101
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:47,482
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

102
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:53,891
as it’s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

103
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:58,063
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

104
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,923
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

105
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,428
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

106
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:10,861
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

107
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:15,225
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

108
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:19,530
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

109
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:28,516
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

110
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:31,971
He has proved it beyond doubt.

111
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:37,284
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

112
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:42,991
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

113
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:53,826
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

114
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,424
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

115
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,571
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

116
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:03,523
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

117
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:06,634
There have been so many events in this
short time.

118
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,710
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

119
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:14,288
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
