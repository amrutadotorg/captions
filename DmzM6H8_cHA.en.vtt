00:00.047 --> 00:06.234
Birthday Puja
March 21, 1996
New Delhi, India

07:35.494 --> 07:41.158
Today, I'm going to talk about the mind.

07:41.494 --> 07:45.449
People don't know what is this mind is.

07:45.650 --> 07:49.496
It is very easy to understand for Sahaja Yogis

07:49.697 --> 07:55.809
that we are the ones who react,

07:56.010 --> 08:01.674
react to everything that is outside.

08:02.877 --> 08:08.535
The reason is we have two horrible tendencies,

08:08.736 --> 08:12.066
one which is an ego,

08:12.267 --> 08:17.324
and another tendency is that

08:17.525 --> 08:23.472
we are being trained that way,

08:23.673 --> 08:27.808
or we can call it the superego or the conditionings.

08:28.009 --> 08:31.980
So, both the things, our ego and conditionings,

08:32.181 --> 08:35.730
are all the time acting outside.

08:35.931 --> 08:39.359
This reaction, which is built-in within us,

08:39.560 --> 08:44.406
is just like bubbles in the ocean.

08:44.607 --> 08:50.070
And these bubbles keep us away from reality.

08:50.271 --> 08:52.453
These bubbles are of thoughts,

08:52.654 --> 08:56.555
and they just blast you all the time in your head,

08:56.756 --> 08:59.391
and you don't know why they are coming.

08:59.592 --> 09:04.032
When you depend on this artificial mind of yours

09:04.233 --> 09:06.470
then you have no discretion

09:06.671 --> 09:11.064
as to understand what is good and what is bad.

09:11.265 --> 09:17.009
This mind is the one where all kinds of evil things start,

09:17.210 --> 09:22.782
all kinds of quarrels, fights and possessiveness,

09:22.983 --> 09:25.899
lastly the war also comes there.

09:26.100 --> 09:32.391
It is in this mind only, which is nothing but a myth,

09:32.592 --> 09:38.079
all these concrete, destructive ideas,

09:38.280 --> 09:41.876
somehow or other come up,

09:42.077 --> 09:45.962
and then they start growing and growing.

09:46.163 --> 09:50.228
Then you find people whom you can impress also,

09:50.429 --> 09:55.408
put ideas into their heads - by reading,

09:55.609 --> 09:58.971
they learn, or by their lectures, or by mesmerism,

09:59.172 --> 10:01.284
whatever kinds of things they can do.

10:01.485 --> 10:04.268
They put your mind into such a frame

10:04.469 --> 10:09.338
that you accept these destructive ideas,

10:09.539 --> 10:14.244
for yourself individually, or maybe for the collective.

10:14.445 --> 10:17.260
So this mind is just a myth

10:17.461 --> 10:21.385
and we are working through this mind.

10:21.586 --> 10:25.252
We are all the time satisfying ourselves by saying,

10:25.453 --> 10:29.861
“Oh, that's my mind, my mind wants it.”

10:30.062 --> 10:37.166
You see, like one Indian Sahaja Yogi went to America,

10:37.390 --> 10:40.603
and he told Me that, “Americans are maneuvering.”

10:40.804 --> 10:44.072
Maneuver means they are mad after their mind.

10:44.273 --> 10:46.273
I said, “What do you mean?” He said,

10:46.474 --> 10:50.953
“I gave money to my wife to buy one bush shirt for me.

10:51.154 --> 10:53.906
She went and bought some skirts.

10:54.107 --> 10:57.453
And she has many skirts, but she bought some skirts.

10:57.654 --> 11:00.367
So I asked her, 'Why did you buy the skirts?'

11:00.568 --> 11:03.226
So she said, 'My mind said that,

11:03.427 --> 11:06.656
"you should buy the skirts", so I bought skirts’.”

11:06.857 --> 11:10.659
So, this is what it is, that the mind

11:10.860 --> 11:13.573
can take you to all kinds of wrong things

11:13.774 --> 11:17.190
because it has no connection with reality, firstly,

11:17.391 --> 11:23.784
and secondly it is a mythical thing,

11:23.985 --> 11:27.143
absolutely mythical.

11:27.344 --> 11:30.035
You see, people think that whatever they have created,

11:30.236 --> 11:35.394
it is out of their mind. Is a wrong idea, absolutely wrong idea.

11:35.595 --> 11:39.333
All great scientists, say - Einstein has said that,

11:39.534 --> 11:46.013
“I was tired trying to find out the Theory of Relativity,

11:46.214 --> 11:49.346
very tired.” He had some concept,

11:49.547 --> 11:52.362
like all scientists take up some sort of a concept,

11:52.563 --> 11:55.346
and they tried to build up their research on that,

11:55.547 --> 12:00.323
“And then I thought, it’s a wrong concept that I have taken up.

12:00.524 --> 12:03.323
Suddenly”, he said, “I went into the garden,

12:03.524 --> 12:08.245
I said let’s try and play with the soap bubbles.”

12:08.446 --> 12:11.362
He was playing with the soap bubbles like a small child,

12:11.563 --> 12:16.714
“and suddenly, from somewhere unknown”, he says,

12:16.915 --> 12:22.167
the Theory of Relativity dawned upon him.

12:22.368 --> 12:24.368
Many scientists have said that -

12:24.569 --> 12:28.376
that they don't know from where they get this idea.

12:28.577 --> 12:33.149
From where did they get it? It has a special study now

12:33.350 --> 12:35.350
people are doing to find out

12:35.551 --> 12:38.413
how these scientists got these things.

12:38.614 --> 12:41.155
And in a very Sahaj manner,

12:41.356 --> 12:44.460
even the way penicillin was discovered,

12:44.661 --> 12:47.608
or anything was discovered by these people,

12:47.809 --> 12:52.241
was not through the probing or manipulation of the mind,

12:52.442 --> 12:56.608
but through some unknown force it came into their mind,

12:56.809 --> 12:59.398
and that's what they thought, that

12:59.599 --> 13:02.382
this was from their mind, some, some.

13:02.583 --> 13:05.085
But most of them realized, even Newton realized

13:05.286 --> 13:08.093
that, “It is coming from something,

13:08.294 --> 13:10.749
some source which I am not aware of.”

13:10.950 --> 13:16.171
As Sahaja Yogis you know it is the Source of the Divine Power,

13:16.372 --> 13:20.335
which is all-pervading, the Paramchaitanya.

13:20.536 --> 13:23.874
You know, because you can feel it, you know it is there.

13:24.075 --> 13:28.101
But, even when you know, you must know you have to go

13:28.302 --> 13:32.601
beyond your mind into thoughtless awareness, minimum.

13:32.802 --> 13:35.109
Always I tell you, “Meditate, meditate”,

13:35.310 --> 13:38.281
because you should be in thoughtless awareness,

13:38.482 --> 13:41.281
where you do not react.

13:41.482 --> 13:43.734
So, what happens, you become a witness,

13:43.935 --> 13:47.577
you become the witness of the whole drama, of the whole scene,

13:47.778 --> 13:52.429
and you are absolutely at ease with yourself, no problem.

13:52.630 --> 13:56.140
And what you are doing that you become an instrument

13:56.341 --> 13:59.507
of this Paramachaitanya, of this all-pervading power.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.062
You are just watching, you are a witness,

14:02.263 --> 14:04.828
and as watching everything,

14:05.029 --> 14:11.156
you realize that whatever you watch cannot react on you.

14:11.357 --> 14:13.883
But you know what it is,

14:14.084 --> 14:17.789
and this is what is the state in which you understand

14:17.990 --> 14:21.242
the reality of the whole situation.

14:21.443 --> 14:25.644
I've told you many a times that,
if you are standing in the water

14:25.845 --> 14:33.643
you are afraid that the waves will - might kill you.

14:33.844 --> 14:37.323
But supposing you get into a boat,

14:37.524 --> 14:45.655
then you can watch those waves as something beautiful, maybe.

14:45.856 --> 14:49.194
If you learn how to swim, you can jump

14:49.395 --> 14:53.225
and bring back people who are getting drowned.

14:53.426 --> 14:59.257
This is exactly what happens when you are

14:59.458 --> 15:05.257
in that state that you can give Realizations to others.

15:05.458 --> 15:10.226
You can put them in connection with the Divine Power.

15:10.427 --> 15:16.312
But first of all you must know how to become

15:16.513 --> 15:19.500
thoughtlessly aware. Some people say,

15:19.701 --> 15:23.820
“Mother, for a second only we become, for two seconds we become”,

15:24.021 --> 15:28.919
because, you see, in our mind,
even if you come to Sahaja Yog,

15:29.120 --> 15:32.202
you have so many conditionings to begin with.

15:32.403 --> 15:35.468
First of all, if you are born an Indian

15:35.669 --> 15:38.335
then you are identified with India.

15:38.536 --> 15:41.991
If you are born in England, you are identified with England.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.568
One thing I've noticed about Sahaja Yogis,

15:44.769 --> 15:49.310
once they get out of this nonsense of this mind,

15:49.511 --> 15:51.511
first thing they start criticizing

15:51.712 --> 15:57.589
the way they have been living in atmosphere,

15:57.790 --> 16:00.080
for example they’ll say, “Ah, this is Indian,

16:00.281 --> 16:04.588
now, this is what the Indians are.” Then you'll say, “This is”,

16:04.789 --> 16:08.190
if they are British, they'll say, “These are the British, you see.”

16:08.391 --> 16:10.870
They will be the best to criticize.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.800
Even others cannot criticize as they criticize,

16:14.001 --> 16:18.203
for example, Europeans will criticize Europeans, saying that,

16:18.404 --> 16:22.835
“Ah – Europeans, all right, I know Europeans very well”, like that.

16:23.036 --> 16:27.663
The mind itself, you see, starts seeing, then,

16:27.864 --> 16:32.781
what you can say, that mind itself sees that it's a myth.

16:32.982 --> 16:36.062
And then the cheating that takes place all the time,

16:36.263 --> 16:41.117
that the intelligence that cheats itself, stops.

16:41.318 --> 16:48.172
You start seeing the thing in a proper, full manner,

16:48.373 --> 16:50.992
because you don't react.

16:51.193 --> 16:58.505
To react is a sign of a person who is very conditioned.

16:58.870 --> 17:01.025
You can be conditioned by many other things, like

17:01.226 --> 17:03.226
you are born in a particular religion.

17:03.427 --> 17:06.416
Now, as you know, what has religion to do nowadays

17:06.617 --> 17:11.213
with human beings? There's no real religion anywhere,

17:11.414 --> 17:14.385
it has become like a money-orientation,

17:14.586 --> 17:18.260
or you can say, power orientation.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.580
That's why they are all fighting among themselves,

17:20.781 --> 17:25.166
and you know for definite that no religion is exclusive.

17:25.367 --> 17:29.744
But they fight. The reason is, the mind is conditioned

17:29.945 --> 17:32.447
that, 'you must fight for your religion'.

17:32.648 --> 17:35.408
Now, they have no religion within;

17:35.609 --> 17:39.353
there's no religion that is working out in their lives.

17:39.554 --> 17:45.431
They might be the most corrupt, most immoral people,

17:45.632 --> 17:49.876
but they belong to a particular religion, like a club.

17:50.077 --> 17:55.548
And then they start, you see, identifying themselves as something,

17:55.749 --> 17:58.189
and they have a right to do these things,

17:58.390 --> 18:02.337
because they belong to a particular religion or to cult,

18:02.538 --> 18:04.538
and this and that.

18:04.913 --> 18:09.610
Now, there are people who can really use this mind,

18:09.811 --> 18:11.818
though it is artificial.

18:12.019 --> 18:15.102
In modern times, we are using so many artificial things

18:15.303 --> 18:20.141
and this artificiality can creep into everything, like plastic.

18:20.342 --> 18:23.977
So, this mind can penetrate into anything

18:24.178 --> 18:26.649
and it penetrates into the minds of people.

18:26.850 --> 18:31.938
That's how Hitler managed all the young people of Germany.

18:32.139 --> 18:37.571
All these people who have been able to destroy.

18:37.772 --> 18:45.457
The reasoning which is logical, not through the mind.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.301
If it is through the mind it's no logic.

18:49.502 --> 18:56.791
It is just a reasoning that we can see clearly stupidity.

18:57.721 --> 19:04.122
Because this mind, which is just a bubble, as I told you,

19:04.323 --> 19:09.560
and is so limited, that it cannot comprehend

19:09.761 --> 19:15.589
the beauty, the glory, the expanse of reality.

19:16.464 --> 19:21.326
This mind is just a collection of all the garbage, we should say,

19:21.527 --> 19:25.084
which we have to, somehow or other, deny

19:25.285 --> 19:29.873
and tell ourselves that, “I have to go beyond my mind.

19:30.074 --> 19:35.777
So-called mind of mine has done no good for me.

19:40.043 --> 19:47.880
And this mind of mine, which has been all the time controlling me,

19:48.081 --> 19:51.641
is just like the watch we have made and it is controlling us,

19:51.842 --> 19:56.115
or like the computer that controls us.”

19:56.881 --> 19:59.461
So we have to be careful

19:59.662 --> 20:02.297
that we are the ones who have created this mind,

20:02.498 --> 20:06.810
and this mind has no business to control us.

20:07.357 --> 20:10.304
Many people try to control the mind.

20:10.505 --> 20:14.390
There's a way of doing it that, “I’ll control my mind now.”

20:14.591 --> 20:18.210
Now, try to understand, how will you control the mind?

20:18.411 --> 20:20.694
Only through mind.

20:20.895 --> 20:23.561
Either by ego or by your conditioning.

20:23.762 --> 20:27.350
You have no means of controlling your mind,

20:27.551 --> 20:31.288
because it is the mind which you have created,

20:31.489 --> 20:36.617
and that is just existing there, which you cannot control,

20:36.818 --> 20:40.864
though you might think, 'I can control.'

20:42.388 --> 20:48.210
You have to go beyond this mind.
And to go beyond this mind

20:48.411 --> 20:53.757
the most helpful thing is Kundalini awakening.

20:53.958 --> 20:56.859
Because She passes through your limbic area,

20:57.060 --> 21:01.570
pierces through your fontanel bone area

21:01.771 --> 21:09.476
and just takes you away, out into the realm of reality

21:09.677 --> 21:18.140
and the Yoga takes place between your brain, I should say,

21:18.341 --> 21:22.320
your heart, with this All-pervading Power.

21:22.521 --> 21:26.718
She's the one which connects, She's the one who does it.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.679
Many people are doing Sahaja Yog, I know that,

21:29.880 --> 21:35.093
but it's difficult for them, sometimes to get to meditation,

21:35.294 --> 21:39.148
to establish this thoughtless awareness,

21:39.349 --> 21:43.632
which is an extremely important state

21:43.833 --> 21:46.718
which you all should achieve.

21:46.919 --> 21:50.741
So many Sahaja Yogis are there, and I'm happy to know that

21:50.942 --> 21:52.942
they are getting deeper and deeper,

21:53.143 --> 21:57.411
but as long as they are in the turmoil of their mind

21:57.612 --> 22:00.145
they cannot progress.

22:00.346 --> 22:07.645
Whatever is created out of their mind has no reality in it,

22:07.846 --> 22:15.622
is very limited, and is also, sometimes very repulsive,

22:15.823 --> 22:17.823
because with this mind people start thinking,

22:18.024 --> 22:20.024
“I am such and such”, you know.

22:20.225 --> 22:23.075
Now you become, supposing, I don't know what, position,

22:23.276 --> 22:27.341
but supposing you become the Governor,

22:27.542 --> 22:29.542
then you think you can do what you like,

22:29.743 --> 22:31.446
because you have become the Governor.

22:31.647 --> 22:34.571
This mind doesn't know that you have become the Governor,

22:34.772 --> 22:37.227
you are not the Governor.

22:37.428 --> 22:39.428
This governorship is ruling you,

22:39.629 --> 22:42.725
not that you are ruling the governorship.

22:42.926 --> 22:46.178
Once these ideas come into your head,

22:46.379 --> 22:50.295
you start behaving in a manner in which you should not behave.

22:50.496 --> 22:53.600
Even among Sahaja Yogis there are leaders.

22:53.801 --> 22:57.030
Leaders also start sometimes thinking, 'Ah, I'm a leader'.

22:57.231 --> 22:59.231
It's a myth, absolute myth,

22:59.432 --> 23:01.794
leadership in Sahaja Yoga is an absolute myth,

23:01.995 --> 23:05.552
which you should know. But once they know they are leaders, see,

23:05.753 --> 23:15.007
they become, sort of absolutely mindful

23:15.208 --> 23:17.851
and full of thoughts.

23:18.052 --> 23:25.637
Thoughts how to dominate, how to control.

23:25.838 --> 23:29.856
When they start controlling others, then you must know that

23:30.057 --> 23:33.653
it is the mind which is telling them to control.

23:33.854 --> 23:37.481
Why to control anyone? If you are a real Sahaja Yogi,

23:37.682 --> 23:40.660
there is no need to control.

23:40.861 --> 23:43.941
There is no need to maneuver, to manipulate.

23:44.142 --> 23:48.871
Now, once your attention goes beyond the mind,

23:49.072 --> 23:54.910
only the Sahaj Yogis will understand this point very clearly,

23:55.111 --> 23:59.762
when this mind goes beyond the thoughts

23:59.963 --> 24:06.306
then the manipulation of the attention is very important.

24:06.877 --> 24:09.582
Then whatever you manipulate,

24:09.783 --> 24:15.259
means you take this attention to this or to that or to that.

24:15.627 --> 24:19.114
You’ll be surprised how dynamic you become,

24:19.315 --> 24:25.213
how effective you become, and how knowledgeable you become.

24:25.604 --> 24:27.864
Because, once

24:28.065 --> 24:32.653
you can take this attention to anything you want,

24:32.854 --> 24:36.733
immediately there is light on that issue, on that person,

24:36.934 --> 24:39.233
on that problem,

24:39.434 --> 24:45.616
and you see how it works out, how it helps.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.817
In Sahaja Yoga you have said, “Mother,

24:48.018 --> 24:51.395
there have been lots of miracles with Your Attention”,

24:51.596 --> 24:53.965
or something like that. I agree,

24:54.166 --> 24:58.582
but your attention also is quite capable of doing things

24:58.783 --> 25:01.066
which normal people can't do,

25:01.267 --> 25:04.175
because now your attention is purified, firstly,

25:04.376 --> 25:09.769
and secondly it is manipulated with the Divine Power,

25:09.970 --> 25:15.438
and is manifesting its powers.

25:16.368 --> 25:19.886
But, before that I have seen people who come to Sahaja Yog,

25:20.087 --> 25:23.230
they send me letters of crying, 'Mother, this is happening,

25:23.431 --> 25:28.207
that is happening, my father is sick and my leg is paining,

25:28.408 --> 25:30.746
my hands are paining', all kinds of things,

25:30.947 --> 25:33.436
not only at the physical level, but also on mental level,

25:33.637 --> 25:35.637
and all sorts of things, they go on.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.051
They sometimes write to Me such long letters,

25:38.252 --> 25:40.371
I don't know how to write it back.

25:40.572 --> 25:44.402
There's nothing to write so much.

25:44.603 --> 25:48.816
But they do, because at that stage they are still reacting,

25:49.017 --> 25:51.622
and they don't know what to do. They go to such a limit,

25:51.823 --> 25:54.231
that they think that Sahaja Yoga is like a contract.

25:54.432 --> 25:57.325
'Now I've come to Sahaja Yog, I must get this.

25:57.526 --> 25:59.526
This must happen. Only they come to Sahaja Yog,

25:59.727 --> 26:02.737
then they think it's a contract, and they must get this,

26:02.938 --> 26:04.938
and they must get that help.

26:05.139 --> 26:11.165
All this kind of behavior is not that of a Sahaja Yogi.

26:11.374 --> 26:15.376
Sahaj Yogi, in Sanskrit, is a very good word, Datasta.

26:15.577 --> 26:18.235
Is a very good word, which I'll try to explain,

26:18.436 --> 26:24.813
but cannot be really translated.

26:25.014 --> 26:30.118
Datasta means the one who is standing on the shore,

26:30.319 --> 26:34.016
on the shore and watching.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.649
That is the state in which you have to be.

26:37.850 --> 26:43.646
But, as a result, you do not become a person who is not effective.

26:44.100 --> 26:47.063
You become extremely effective.

26:47.264 --> 26:49.712
If such people are there,

26:49.913 --> 26:53.525
you won't believe so many things can happen.

26:53.726 --> 26:56.384
Wars can stop,

26:56.585 --> 26:59.454
peace can spread,

26:59.655 --> 27:03.774
people who are evil will be exposed.

27:03.975 --> 27:10.446
Now, because it's such an en-masse working out of Sahaja Yog,

27:10.647 --> 27:14.923
Sahaja Yogis should not, in any way,

27:15.124 --> 27:18.782
find themselves in conflict with each other.

27:18.983 --> 27:22.399
Still, I find sometimes. And I'm amazed,

27:22.600 --> 27:25.946
how people criticize other Sahaja Yogis, or other leaders,

27:26.147 --> 27:29.009
while they themselves have problems.

27:29.210 --> 27:33.384
The reason is that once you start going beyond the mind,

27:33.585 --> 27:37.243
you automatically become introspective.

27:37.444 --> 27:39.493
And you start seeing, 'What's wrong with me,

27:39.694 --> 27:42.587
this mind of mine, now?'

27:42.788 --> 27:44.788
So, better stand before the mirror,

27:44.989 --> 27:48.186
or can even close your eyes and say, “Now, Mr. Mind,

27:48.387 --> 27:50.881
what are you doing?

27:51.082 --> 27:53.082
What are you up to?”

27:53.283 --> 27:56.756
You face yourself, you stand out from yourself,

27:56.957 --> 28:03.097
and see for yourself and ask the mind, “What are you up to?"

28:03.379 --> 28:07.741
That's the way, once you are out of it you can control it.

28:07.942 --> 28:10.249
I'm happy you are celebrating My Birthday.

28:10.450 --> 28:13.608
Now I'm supposed to be quite old, though I don't think like that,

28:13.809 --> 28:15.809
because I don't think.

28:16.010 --> 28:21.028
One has to be beyond, beyond the mind.

28:21.229 --> 28:23.653
To think about yourself all the time

28:23.854 --> 28:27.231
or to think about things

28:27.432 --> 28:30.254
which do not concern you sometimes, you know.

28:30.455 --> 28:33.934
And just try to put your mind into a turmoil,

28:34.135 --> 28:38.838
It is very dangerous these days.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.510
To stop your thought, first of all,

28:41.711 --> 28:44.979
I think in Sahaja Yoga you should stop reading anything.

28:45.180 --> 28:48.713
Because if you start reading, then what happens again,

28:48.914 --> 28:51.690
you start collecting thoughts from that book.

28:51.891 --> 28:53.891
I've seen many people

28:54.092 --> 28:56.946
whose mind is nothing but the books from others,

28:57.147 --> 29:00.462
or the words of others, or quotation of others.

29:00.663 --> 29:02.900
They are nowhere. You cannot find them.

29:03.101 --> 29:07.580
They are all lost people, “He says so and that one say so."

29:07.781 --> 29:09.781
When I was writing this book,

29:09.998 --> 29:13.078
which you know that I have written down, they were saying,

29:13.279 --> 29:19.351
“Mother, but Plato said like this, and Rousseau said like that.”

29:19.552 --> 29:21.976
I said, “Let them say whatever they wanted to,

29:22.177 --> 29:25.393
I'll say what I know. Why should I refer to them.

29:25.594 --> 29:27.596
I don't have to go to the libraries and read

29:27.797 --> 29:32.259
what Rousseau said, what Plato said, what - nothing.”

29:32.460 --> 29:36.048
What I know, whatever I have witnessed in My life,

29:36.249 --> 29:38.978
I should write it.

29:39.179 --> 29:43.056
Clearly, without thinking about what others have to say,

29:43.257 --> 29:45.712
what others have described.

29:45.913 --> 29:49.790
And also another, this mind has another big, big problem,

29:49.991 --> 29:55.118
that whatever is written down in black and white becomes Bible.

29:55.319 --> 30:00.563
Then, whatever is done before

30:00.764 --> 30:05.719
is something great. Like, now there is no Christ,

30:05.920 --> 30:11.211
there is no Mohammed Sahib, and there is no Abraham.

30:11.412 --> 30:15.164
There's no Krishna, there's no Ram today.

30:15.365 --> 30:19.547
But they will think of what Rama said, what Krishna said,

30:19.748 --> 30:23.336
then in Gita, this He said, in Gita He has not said a word

30:23.537 --> 30:28.216
about Kundalini, so why Mother is talking about Kundalini?

30:28.639 --> 30:31.719
He might have said – can't say – who wrote Gita?

30:31.920 --> 30:35.781
Never Sri Krishna. Christ never wrote Bible.

30:35.982 --> 30:38.813
Koran was not written by Mohammed Sahib.

30:39.014 --> 30:43.717
So, what they have said – why should you worry about that?

30:44.030 --> 30:48.063
Instead of that, you take the experience that everybody has said.

30:48.264 --> 30:51.282
That, “You are to be born again”, everybody has said.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.852
That, “You have to go beyond the mind”, also everyone has said.

30:55.053 --> 30:58.641
Why not do that and then see for yourself?

30:58.842 --> 31:00.860
But people like, and they're identified.

31:01.061 --> 31:03.665
Now, if they are Christians, who are coming to Sahaj Yoga,

31:03.866 --> 31:08.392
still they are happy if it is Christ, very identified,

31:08.593 --> 31:12.525
if they are Hindus should be Krishna, or Rama maybe.

31:12.726 --> 31:16.205
If they are Muslims, it should be Mohammed Sahib, Fatima or someone.

31:16.406 --> 31:19.205
Otherwise, they can't get out of it, this is very difficult.

31:19.406 --> 31:23.626
Their mind is such that is so much made, from childhood,

31:23.827 --> 31:25.278
you are told, “You are a Muslim, you are a Muslim,

31:25.479 --> 31:28.432
you are a Christian, you are a Christian”, so they believe it.

31:28.633 --> 31:31.251
Supposing you are born in some other religion

31:31.452 --> 31:34.876
then what would have happened?

31:35.077 --> 31:37.173
You would have believed something different,

31:37.374 --> 31:41.712
but this mind has been injected with the ideas

31:41.913 --> 31:43.913
which has gone into your head

31:44.114 --> 31:50.319
and that's how you are so much without any freedom.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.671
You are tied down with these conditionings.

31:53.872 --> 31:58.382
And that's what I find among Sahaja Yogis also,

31:58.583 --> 32:03.007
a very big conditioning that

32:03.208 --> 32:10.948
such and such thing is good or bad, they decide.

32:11.149 --> 32:15.909
You see for yourself. For example, if I talk on Guru Nanak,

32:16.110 --> 32:18.722
then the Sikhs will be very happy,

32:18.923 --> 32:22.331
but I talk on Christ, they won't be happy.

32:22.532 --> 32:25.526
I talked on Christ in Poona, so they said,

32:25.727 --> 32:28.331
“She's trying to convert everybody to Christianity”,

32:28.532 --> 32:32.706
and when I was talking about Shri Krishna in London,

32:32.907 --> 32:37.034
they said, “She's making everybody a Hindu.”

32:37.235 --> 32:41.682
So this identification that we have

32:41.883 --> 32:47.187
is coming to us when so intensely, from,

32:47.388 --> 32:50.143
we should say, it's like from the birth.

32:50.344 --> 32:54.081
All these ideas still are there and we are not free.

32:54.282 --> 32:57.917
That doesn't mean that you should not have faith in all of these people.

32:58.118 --> 33:02.112
They were all great, we have great respect for them and understanding.

33:02.313 --> 33:08.620
But first you be free, you be free to know them.

33:08.821 --> 33:11.979
Your mind should be free. It should not be the injections

33:12.180 --> 33:16.034
that are put into your heads, that you cannot see the point.

33:16.235 --> 33:18.384
That's why they don't enjoy also, I've seen,

33:18.585 --> 33:22.697
partly they enjoy, partly they don't.

33:22.898 --> 33:25.049
So, to become a free person,

33:25.250 --> 33:29.572
because Sahaj Yoga is to give you complete freedom,

33:29.773 --> 33:33.892
and also complete sense of freedom,

33:34.093 --> 33:36.822
so you respect the freedom of others,

33:37.023 --> 33:40.338
on the whole you understand what freedom is.

33:40.539 --> 33:47.273
If that doesn't work out, then I would
say that Sahaja Yoga is of no use,

33:47.474 --> 33:50.546
because it should work out in such a manner that

33:50.747 --> 33:56.593
you should get rid of all these conditionings you have had.

33:56.794 --> 34:02.234
Now, take the second enemy of ours – is Mr. Ego,

34:02.435 --> 34:04.435
which is another headache,

34:04.636 --> 34:08.748
and which works very fast in many countries

34:08.949 --> 34:13.240
where already ego has been bloated.

34:13.441 --> 34:16.327
See these balloons.

34:16.528 --> 34:18.733
If they were bloated, all right,

34:18.934 --> 34:22.960
it’s very easy to again make them big,

34:23.161 --> 34:26.278
but if they were never done that, then it's difficult,

34:26.479 --> 34:29.075
you have to pull it out, you have to put it to the pumps,

34:29.276 --> 34:31.747
otherwise it won't be bloated.

34:31.948 --> 34:36.364
Now, this ego comes to us from different, different angles,

34:36.565 --> 34:39.677
and it - actually, you'll be surprised,

34:39.878 --> 34:42.724
from the deformity of our chakras.

34:42.925 --> 34:47.607
For some people, money is very important.

34:47.808 --> 34:49.808
We must get money, somehow or other.

34:50.009 --> 34:52.386
If I don't get money, what's the use of being in Sahaja Yoga?

34:52.587 --> 34:55.214
Money is very important.

34:55.415 --> 34:58.862
We are living in a money-oriented world, no doubt.

34:59.063 --> 35:02.487
But I have told you that what's the use of having money

35:02.688 --> 35:06.126
that makes you a fool, which takes you –

35:06.327 --> 35:11.423
now, see the countries which are very much money- oriented,

35:11.624 --> 35:14.001
who are supposed to be very rich,

35:14.202 --> 35:17.712
all the Scandinavian countries and Switzerland,

35:17.913 --> 35:21.098
whatever may be have, they might have done to get that money,

35:21.299 --> 35:24.161
doesn't matter, but they are people with money.

35:24.362 --> 35:27.265
People are committing suicide, young people are committing suicide,

35:27.466 --> 35:30.804
there's a competition going on, they're very unhappy. Why?

35:31.005 --> 35:34.515
That means money cannot bring happiness.

35:34.716 --> 35:39.171
Money, money, money, money, if that goes into your head also,

35:39.372 --> 35:42.507
then you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

35:42.708 --> 35:49.093
But the money is there just for you to use it

35:49.294 --> 35:53.098
to express your love.

35:53.380 --> 35:59.890
Now, you go to the shop.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.624
Then you see something, "Aaaah!

36:02.825 --> 36:09.801
This is very nice to be given to such and such person."

36:10.263 --> 36:13.429
You think like that. It's a very sweet feeling you get there.

36:13.630 --> 36:17.696
Ah - you can give this to this one, eh? He needs it very much.

36:17.897 --> 36:22.180
When your mind becomes the other way round,

36:22.381 --> 36:24.664
I mean, when it is thoughtlessly aware,

36:24.865 --> 36:30.258
then you will buy something that is joy giving,

36:30.459 --> 36:35.078
something artistic, something beautiful,

36:35.279 --> 36:40.294
something useful to that person.

36:40.990 --> 36:48.344
It will be a kind of a mind that will be extremely full of generosity,

36:48.545 --> 36:51.125
enjoying its generosity.

36:51.326 --> 36:55.180
And all the time it will guide you

36:55.381 --> 37:03.061
to the projection of your attention to things

37:03.262 --> 37:08.613
by which you can give happiness to others.

37:09.270 --> 37:14.001
Small, small things, not necessarily expensive things.

37:14.202 --> 37:18.040
If you have money better spend money in buying things

37:18.241 --> 37:25.618
that you can give to others, that you can express your love,

37:25.819 --> 37:30.115
your gratitude, your Shraddha.

37:30.647 --> 37:37.891
It is very remarkable how people give money to these sadhus and babas

37:38.092 --> 37:40.092
in thousands and thousands and crores of it.

37:41.756 --> 37:45.719
Because, I think in them it has come that

37:45.920 --> 37:48.373
to satisfy their Shraddha

37:48.574 --> 37:51.578
they must give it, and so they give.

37:51.779 --> 37:56.101
And they have amassed and amassed so much money,

37:56.302 --> 38:00.458
they have no sense of it. They don't understand the value of that.

38:00.659 --> 38:03.216
To them it is nothing but money.

38:03.417 --> 38:09.505
So, in the modern times I think the worst thing of ego is money.

38:09.706 --> 38:11.972
I have seen people who are very rich,

38:12.173 --> 38:16.097
supposed to be great business walahs and something like that,

38:16.298 --> 38:18.420
they must meet Me separately,

38:18.621 --> 38:23.574
“We must come, Mother, and see You.”

38:24.582 --> 38:28.483
But they're useless people, absolutely useless.

38:28.684 --> 38:31.644
So they'll come and tell Me, “You know, I’m having a loss in this,

38:31.845 --> 38:33.845
I'm having a loss in that,

38:34.092 --> 38:38.435
can you help us in this way or that way?”

38:38.720 --> 38:41.394
I just don't say anything to them, but they have said,

38:41.595 --> 38:43.696
“Mother we have recovered because of Your blessings.” Maybe.

38:46.322 --> 38:48.738
But it’s stupid.

38:48.939 --> 38:54.504
Like Lao-Tse described that you are going through the Yangtse river,

38:54.705 --> 38:59.356
it's beautiful. On the sides you see beautiful scenes,

38:59.557 --> 39:04.489
but you better be on the boat and reach the ocean.

39:04.690 --> 39:07.528
In the same way, supposing we have to catch a plane,

39:07.729 --> 39:09.755
and we see something very nice on the road

39:09.956 --> 39:14.802
and get down there, how can we catch the plane?

39:15.003 --> 39:20.177
So these side-effects of this mind are these,

39:20.378 --> 39:24.927
that we divert our attention to wrong things

39:25.128 --> 39:28.615
and waste our energy into it. Ultimately we are not happy,

39:28.816 --> 39:33.599
as you know that the - in general - wants are not satiable.

39:33.800 --> 39:41.771
It’s the love that you give and the love that you receive,

39:41.972 --> 39:46.052
which is not a love which is entangled into anything

39:46.253 --> 39:49.060
with any purpose, with any idea,

39:49.261 --> 39:54.193
but just to feel that love,

39:54.394 --> 40:01.709
pure love within yourself and within others.

40:01.910 --> 40:05.990
Is the greatest gift of the Divine.

40:06.191 --> 40:10.021
All other things are useless, you'll find it.

40:10.222 --> 40:13.005
You find it every day. Today you want to have a car,

40:13.206 --> 40:15.392
all right, have it. Then you want to have a house, have it,

40:15.593 --> 40:17.593
but you are not bothered about the car,

40:17.794 --> 40:19.794
now you want to have a house. Now you get the house,

40:19.995 --> 40:21.995
then you are not satisfied.

40:22.196 --> 40:26.750
Then you want to have something else and something else.

40:27.259 --> 40:32.417
So then, which is that 'want' which is satisfying?

40:32.618 --> 40:38.737
It’s this pure love, genuine love
that you feel for the others,

40:38.938 --> 40:42.750
and others feel for you.

40:43.547 --> 40:47.323
We have others, lots of conditionings of ego.

40:47.524 --> 40:52.612
In our country specially, this Indian country, India - so-called. ”

40:52.813 --> 40:57.050
You see, to dominate the wife is one of the greatest ego.

40:57.251 --> 41:01.277
I have seen people, how they tortured women,

41:01.478 --> 41:05.347
their wives and the children of others,

41:05.548 --> 41:09.868
just because they think, “I am a man."

41:10.923 --> 41:13.063
What do you get? You don't get any joy,

41:13.264 --> 41:15.347
you can never be joyous.

41:15.548 --> 41:20.777
If you try to dominate another person you can never be joyous.

41:20.978 --> 41:25.793
Never be joyous. It's only through loving and affection

41:25.994 --> 41:30.395
and care that you can feel the joy,

41:30.596 --> 41:34.442
because joy has these symptoms,

41:34.643 --> 41:39.083
joy is not domination, or demanding, or asking.

41:39.284 --> 41:42.935
These are not the signs of a person who is joyous.

41:43.136 --> 41:49.748
The joyous person is that who just enjoys the caring,

41:49.949 --> 41:57.472
the loving, the gentle relationship.

41:57.901 --> 42:01.284
And this is another point where I think

42:01.486 --> 42:04.332
Indian men specially, especially in the North,

42:04.533 --> 42:07.395
because of, they say Muslim influence, whatever it is,

42:07.596 --> 42:13.153
in the North the men are extremely dominating to their wives.

42:13.354 --> 42:15.583
And they insult the wife also very much.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.466
So now the women here have become extremely dominating also,

42:19.667 --> 42:21.755
naturally action has a reaction.

42:21.956 --> 42:25.458
This reaction itself is a wrong idea,

42:25.659 --> 42:29.153
and this reaction should be just dissolved

42:29.354 --> 42:36.564
into the feeling of pure love, the Ocean of Compassion.

42:37.057 --> 42:39.497
For example, I see on the streets of Delhi,

42:39.698 --> 42:42.481
so many people begging, small children are there,

42:42.682 --> 42:50.090
and all that. And now the feeling that I get is not of

42:50.291 --> 42:52.621
scolding them or getting angry with them.

42:52.822 --> 42:55.379
Maybe they are cheating, maybe anything they're after.

42:55.580 --> 42:57.580
Everybody's cheating you, and those who have lots of money

42:57.837 --> 42:59.837
are cheating you, so what is there

43:00.038 --> 43:02.038
if these poor people are cheating, doesn't matter.

43:02.239 --> 43:05.571
But the compassion is built-in within Me like this that,

43:05.772 --> 43:11.766
“Let Me somehow get a plot of land somewhere,

43:11.967 --> 43:17.407
let Me organize some sort of a place

43:17.608 --> 43:22.641
where all these people who are orphans can be put there,

43:22.842 --> 43:28.459
and given all the...

43:31.373 --> 43:38.383
all the help. And maybe from this pond of misery and poverty

43:38.584 --> 43:41.805
you might get lots of lotuses coming out.

43:42.006 --> 43:45.094
But the feeling has to be collective.

43:45.295 --> 43:49.821
I feel that way, that we'll solve the problem of Delhi,

43:50.022 --> 43:53.169
but that doesn't mean that, like other social workers,

43:53.370 --> 43:56.763
like I have been connected with some social workers

43:56.964 --> 43:58.964
and I was amazed that it was nothing but

43:59.165 --> 44:01.214
a ego-pampering business.

44:01.415 --> 44:03.730
It has nothing to do with social workers.

44:03.931 --> 44:12.566
Haphazard and nothing deep in their attention

44:12.767 --> 44:14.767
to look after these people.

44:14.968 --> 44:19.626
So with the great feeling of love and compassion we can do it,

44:19.827 --> 44:23.009
we all can do it, and can work it out.

44:23.210 --> 44:29.431
One of My desires is this. If it is a desire of you all,

44:29.632 --> 44:32.165
it will work out. It's very important

44:32.366 --> 44:37.407
that they are also human beings and we have to look after them.

44:37.608 --> 44:39.608
But for that, one should not think that,

44:39.809 --> 44:44.217
“I will be the treasurer or I'll be the president, and I'll be this.”

44:44.418 --> 44:48.076
All this clergy-ship should go away

44:48.277 --> 44:52.920
from the mind itself, otherwise you are not free.

44:53.121 --> 44:57.818
You are not free, you know, like there's a nice joke about it,

44:58.019 --> 45:03.396
that – one - somebody went to see the minister

45:03.597 --> 45:09.279
and the private secretary was there, attending to the people.

45:09.480 --> 45:12.717
And he was getting very angry with them and all that,

45:12.918 --> 45:15.889
so some villagers said to him, “Who are you?”

45:16.090 --> 45:22.670
He said, “Don't you know, I'm P.A.?” “Ah, P.A.”

45:22.871 --> 45:27.631
That means you are drunk, all right, we have nothing to say.

45:27.832 --> 45:33.389
So, a person with ego behaves like a person who has ego,

45:33.590 --> 45:38.991
is a person like a - you can say, a drunkard,

45:39.192 --> 45:42.679
or sometimes like a lunatic also, really like a lunatic.

45:42.880 --> 45:45.749
Sometimes you have to meet them with a bargepole, I told you.

45:45.950 --> 45:49.124
Some of these people who have got awards for peace,

45:49.325 --> 45:51.827
we have to talk to them with a bargepole,

45:52.028 --> 45:55.132
because they might just jump on you, just like a cat,

45:55.333 --> 45:57.655
or could be like a leopard,

45:57.856 --> 45:59.856
you don't know how they are built up.

46:00.057 --> 46:02.528
I don’t know how they got these awards for peace, but they have.

46:02.729 --> 46:05.317
So, the peace is within ourselves

46:05.518 --> 46:09.114
and this peace has to be retained

46:09.315 --> 46:13.091
and introspected and seen.

46:13.292 --> 46:16.982
Are we peaceful or we are reacting?

46:17.183 --> 46:20.732
If we are reacting, then we are not peaceful.

46:20.933 --> 46:24.566
But people will say, 'Yes, yes, I am very peaceful, but I have to react'.

46:24.767 --> 46:30.480
Then you are not peaceful. Just face yourself,

46:30.681 --> 46:33.074
straightforward and see for yourself

46:33.275 --> 46:39.691
that if you are peaceful then this peace will spread all over,

46:39.892 --> 46:43.183
it will help others. It give them physical, mental,

46:43.384 --> 46:46.355
emotional and spiritual peace.

46:46.556 --> 46:49.441
So, you people have a great responsibility

46:49.642 --> 46:53.168
of coming to Sahaja Yoga. It is not just a certificate,

46:53.369 --> 46:57.658
or My badge, that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

46:58.025 --> 47:01.160
I would like also women to see to this point,

47:01.361 --> 47:03.848
because what I have seen about women is that

47:04.056 --> 47:06.056
they are mostly worried about their children,

47:06.257 --> 47:08.931
about their husbands, jobs and things like that.

47:09.132 --> 47:11.603
But they are not worried about others,

47:11.804 --> 47:14.462
about people who are around them,

47:14.663 --> 47:18.790
so they have to also take to Sahaja style of life,

47:18.991 --> 47:23.228
in which they expand their love,

47:23.429 --> 47:27.384
expand their attention to other people,

47:27.585 --> 47:31.236
and see how they can please others.

47:31.437 --> 47:33.970
This situation is –

47:34.171 --> 47:38.344
used to be non-existent in the western countries.

47:38.545 --> 47:42.375
I think they never knew that you should please somebody

47:42.576 --> 47:45.734
for no reward, or for no purpose.

47:45.935 --> 47:48.507
If you give any present to somebody, they'll say,

47:48.708 --> 47:50.708
'Oh. What do you want?'.

47:50.909 --> 47:54.013
'Do you want coffee, or', immediately.

47:54.214 --> 47:56.404
To them they cannot understand that

47:56.605 --> 48:00.756
somebody wants to express one's love, no, they can't.

48:00.957 --> 48:04.264
So, this – now mind has changed, because Sahaja Yogis are there

48:04.465 --> 48:06.465
and they are different people,

48:06.666 --> 48:10.153
but what I have seen before was so remarkable,

48:10.354 --> 48:13.202
that they thought it was a weakness that they are giving

48:13.403 --> 48:16.483
those presents because they feel they're weak.

48:16.684 --> 48:20.663
All these ideas have changing in the West,

48:20.864 --> 48:25.686
and also we should not adopt their stupid ideas that

48:25.887 --> 48:30.288
we can control people by giving them things

48:30.489 --> 48:36.851
or by giving them some sort of promises.

48:37.052 --> 48:40.919
We have, actually, to control ourselves

48:41.120 --> 48:47.132
and that control can come if you do
not allow your mind to control you.

48:47.340 --> 48:50.827
That control is the complete freedom.

48:51.028 --> 48:57.100
For example now, take an aeroplane which is perfectly built,

48:57.301 --> 49:02.569
which is absolutely all right. Then only it can fly.

49:02.770 --> 49:07.491
In the same way, if you are a perfect Sahaja Yogi

49:07.692 --> 49:12.764
then you will have no problems in dealing with any problem,

49:12.965 --> 49:19.217
with any circumstances, with any person whatsoever.

49:19.418 --> 49:22.079
There are many Sahaja Yogis in the West I’ve seen, they’ve said,

49:22.280 --> 49:24.920
“Mother, we don’t want to take any active work

49:25.121 --> 49:27.256
because we’ll develop our ego."

49:27.457 --> 49:29.615
They think their balloon is already bloated out

49:29.816 --> 49:32.404
and if they do some work their ego will go up,

49:32.605 --> 49:36.927
so they say, “We don’t want to do.” It’s not so.

49:37.128 --> 49:40.263
Is their love. You’re working for Love.

49:40.464 --> 49:44.052
Such an Ocean of Love is within you.

49:44.253 --> 49:47.396
How can you do without that?

49:47.597 --> 49:51.427
And this has to work out at every level,

49:51.628 --> 49:57.685
whether it is your family, whether it is your city,

49:57.886 --> 50:03.498
whether it is your country or the whole world.

50:03.699 --> 50:08.076
This is the new generation we have to create of people

50:08.277 --> 50:11.279
who believe in Love which is Truth.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.451
Which is Truth. Without Love you cannot have Truth,

50:15.652 --> 50:18.412
because when you love somebody you know everything

50:18.613 --> 50:20.701
about that person. In the same way,

50:20.902 --> 50:24.060
when you love your country you know everything about that country.

50:24.261 --> 50:26.261
But first you must love.

50:26.462 --> 50:28.462
Why people are now having problems?

50:28.663 --> 50:31.032
Because they don’t love their country.

50:31.233 --> 50:34.798
If you love your country you will know what is the essence

50:34.999 --> 50:38.806
of your country, what is the problems of your country,

50:39.007 --> 50:43.657
what it is going through. And that intense feeling of oneness

50:43.858 --> 50:45.858
itself will work out,

50:46.059 --> 50:48.967
because after all you are connected to the Divine.

50:49.168 --> 50:54.115
But with intensity you should feel for all these things

50:54.316 --> 50:56.316
that are really so destructive

50:56.517 --> 51:00.477
and troublesome in these modern times.

51:00.798 --> 51:04.456
I again want to thank you for celebrating this birthday

51:04.657 --> 51:09.175
and for all the sweetness you have showered upon Me.

51:09.376 --> 51:13.191
You are just like these beautiful flowers for Me,

51:13.392 --> 51:18.918
which are anxious all the time to make you happy,

51:19.119 --> 51:21.762
to please you.

51:21.963 --> 51:24.715
Just like that I find you before Me,

51:24.924 --> 51:27.840
beautiful flowers, fragrant with divinity.

51:28.041 --> 51:33.955
I hope you all will understand your own value and work it out.

51:34.156 --> 51:36.156
May God bless you.
