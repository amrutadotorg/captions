Birthday Puja
March 21, 1996
New Delhi, India

00:07:35.494 --> 00:07:41.158
Today, I'm going to talk about the mind.

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:45.449
People don't know what is this mind is.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.496
It is very easy to understand for Sahaja Yogis

00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:55.809
that we are the ones who react,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:01.674
react to everything that is outside.

00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:08.535
The reason is we have two horrible tendencies,

00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:12.066
one which is an ego,

00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:17.324
and another tendency is that

00:08:17.525 --> 00:08:23.472
we are being trained that way,

00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:27.808
or we can call it the superego or the conditionings.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:31.980
So, both the things, our ego and conditionings,

00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:35.730
are all the time acting outside.

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:39.359
This reaction, which is built-in within us,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.406
is just like bubbles in the ocean.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:50.070
And these bubbles keep us away from reality.

00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:52.453
These bubbles are of thoughts,

00:08:52.654 --> 00:08:56.555
and they just blast you all the time in your head,

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:59.391
and you don't know why they are coming.

00:08:59.592 --> 00:09:04.032
When you depend on this artificial mind of yours

00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:06.470
then you have no discretion

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:11.064
as to understand what is good and what is bad.

00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:17.009
This mind is the one where all kinds of evil things start,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:22.782
all kinds of quarrels, fights and possessiveness,

00:09:22.983 --> 00:09:25.899
lastly the war also comes there.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:32.391
It is in this mind only, which is nothing but a myth,

00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:38.079
all these concrete, destructive ideas,

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.876
somehow or other come up,

00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:45.962
and then they start growing and growing.

00:09:46.163 --> 00:09:50.228
Then you find people whom you can impress also,

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:55.408
put ideas into their heads - by reading,

00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:58.971
they learn, or by their lectures, or by mesmerism,

00:09:59.172 --> 00:10:01.284
whatever kinds of things they can do.

00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:04.268
They put your mind into such a frame

00:10:04.469 --> 00:10:09.338
that you accept these destructive ideas,

00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:14.244
for yourself individually, or maybe for the collective.

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:17.260
So this mind is just a myth

00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:21.385
and we are working through this mind.

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:25.252
We are all the time satisfying ourselves by saying,

00:10:25.453 --> 00:10:29.861
“Oh, that's my mind, my mind wants it.”

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:37.166
You see, like one Indian Sahaja Yogi went to America,

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.603
and he told Me that, “Americans are maneuvering.”

00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:44.072
Maneuver means they are mad after their mind.

00:10:44.273 --> 00:10:46.273
I said, “What do you mean?” He said,

00:10:46.474 --> 00:10:50.953
“I gave money to my wife to buy one bush shirt for me.

00:10:51.154 --> 00:10:53.906
She went and bought some skirts.

00:10:54.107 --> 00:10:57.453
And she has many skirts, but she bought some skirts.

00:10:57.654 --> 00:11:00.367
So I asked her, 'Why did you buy the skirts?'

00:11:00.568 --> 00:11:03.226
So she said, 'My mind said that,

00:11:03.427 --> 00:11:06.656
"you should buy the skirts", so I bought skirts’.”

00:11:06.857 --> 00:11:10.659
So, this is what it is, that the mind

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.573
can take you to all kinds of wrong things

00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:17.190
because it has no connection with reality, firstly,

00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:23.784
and secondly it is a mythical thing,

00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:27.143
absolutely mythical.

00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:30.035
You see, people think that whatever they have created,

00:11:30.236 --> 00:11:35.394
it is out of their mind. Is a wrong idea, absolutely wrong idea.

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:39.333
All great scientists, say - Einstein has said that,

00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:46.013
“I was tired trying to find out the Theory of Relativity,

00:11:46.214 --> 00:11:49.346
very tired.” He had some concept,

00:11:49.547 --> 00:11:52.362
like all scientists take up some sort of a concept,

00:11:52.563 --> 00:11:55.346
and they tried to build up their research on that,

00:11:55.547 --> 00:12:00.323
“And then I thought, it’s a wrong concept that I have taken up.

00:12:00.524 --> 00:12:03.323
Suddenly”, he said, “I went into the garden,

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:08.245
I said let’s try and play with the soap bubbles.”

00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:11.362
He was playing with the soap bubbles like a small child,

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:16.714
“and suddenly, from somewhere unknown”, he says,

00:12:16.915 --> 00:12:22.167
the Theory of Relativity dawned upon him.

00:12:22.368 --> 00:12:24.368
Many scientists have said that -

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:28.376
that they don't know from where they get this idea.

00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:33.149
From where did they get it? It has a special study now

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.350
people are doing to find out

00:12:35.551 --> 00:12:38.413
how these scientists got these things.

00:12:38.614 --> 00:12:41.155
And in a very Sahaj manner,

00:12:41.356 --> 00:12:44.460
even the way penicillin was discovered,

00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:47.608
or anything was discovered by these people,

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:52.241
was not through the probing or manipulation of the mind,

00:12:52.442 --> 00:12:56.608
but through some unknown force it came into their mind,

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:59.398
and that's what they thought, that

00:12:59.599 --> 00:13:02.382
this was from their mind, some, some.

00:13:02.583 --> 00:13:05.085
But most of them realized, even Newton realized

00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:08.093
that, “It is coming from something,

00:13:08.294 --> 00:13:10.749
some source which I am not aware of.”

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:16.171
As Sahaja Yogis you know it is the Source of the Divine Power,

00:13:16.372 --> 00:13:20.335
which is all-pervading, the Paramchaitanya.

00:13:20.536 --> 00:13:23.874
You know, because you can feel it, you know it is there.

00:13:24.075 --> 00:13:28.101
But, even when you know, you must know you have to go

00:13:28.302 --> 00:13:32.601
beyond your mind into thoughtless awareness, minimum.

00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:35.109
Always I tell you, “Meditate, meditate”,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.281
because you should be in thoughtless awareness,

00:13:38.482 --> 00:13:41.281
where you do not react.

00:13:41.482 --> 00:13:43.734
So, what happens, you become a witness,

00:13:43.935 --> 00:13:47.577
you become the witness of the whole drama, of the whole scene,

00:13:47.778 --> 00:13:52.429
and you are absolutely at ease with yourself, no problem.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.140
And what you are doing that you become an instrument

00:13:56.341 --> 00:13:59.507
of this Paramachaitanya, of this all-pervading power.

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:02.062
You are just watching, you are a witness,

00:14:02.263 --> 00:14:04.828
and as watching everything,

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:11.156
you realize that whatever you watch cannot react on you.

00:14:11.357 --> 00:14:13.883
But you know what it is,

00:14:14.084 --> 00:14:17.789
and this is what is the state in which you understand

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.242
the reality of the whole situation.

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:25.644
I've told you many a times that,
if you are standing in the water

00:14:25.845 --> 00:14:33.643
you are afraid that the waves will - might kill you.

00:14:33.844 --> 00:14:37.323
But supposing you get into a boat,

00:14:37.524 --> 00:14:45.655
then you can watch those waves as something beautiful, maybe.

00:14:45.856 --> 00:14:49.194
If you learn how to swim, you can jump

00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:53.225
and bring back people who are getting drowned.

00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:59.257
This is exactly what happens when you are

00:14:59.458 --> 00:15:05.257
in that state that you can give Realizations to others.

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:10.226
You can put them in connection with the Divine Power.

00:15:10.427 --> 00:15:16.312
But first of all you must know how to become

00:15:16.513 --> 00:15:19.500
thoughtlessly aware. Some people say,

00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:23.820
“Mother, for a second only we become, for two seconds we become”,

00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:28.919
because, you see, in our mind,
even if you come to Sahaja Yog,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.202
you have so many conditionings to begin with.

00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:35.468
First of all, if you are born an Indian

00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:38.335
then you are identified with India.

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:41.991
If you are born in England, you are identified with England.

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.568
One thing I've noticed about Sahaja Yogis,

00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:49.310
once they get out of this nonsense of this mind,

00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:51.511
first thing they start criticizing

00:15:51.712 --> 00:15:57.589
the way they have been living in atmosphere,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.080
for example they’ll say, “Ah, this is Indian,

00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:04.588
now, this is what the Indians are.” Then you'll say, “This is”,

00:16:04.789 --> 00:16:08.190
if they are British, they'll say, “These are the British, you see.”

00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:10.870
They will be the best to criticize.

00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:13.800
Even others cannot criticize as they criticize,

00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:18.203
for example, Europeans will criticize Europeans, saying that,

00:16:18.404 --> 00:16:22.835
“Ah – Europeans, all right, I know Europeans very well”, like that.

00:16:23.036 --> 00:16:27.663
The mind itself, you see, starts seeing, then,

00:16:27.864 --> 00:16:32.781
what you can say, that mind itself sees that it's a myth.

00:16:32.982 --> 00:16:36.062
And then the cheating that takes place all the time,

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:41.117
that the intelligence that cheats itself, stops.

00:16:41.318 --> 00:16:48.172
You start seeing the thing in a proper, full manner,

00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:50.992
because you don't react.

00:16:51.193 --> 00:16:58.505
To react is a sign of a person who is very conditioned.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.025
You can be conditioned by many other things, like

00:17:01.226 --> 00:17:03.226
you are born in a particular religion.

00:17:03.427 --> 00:17:06.416
Now, as you know, what has religion to do nowadays

00:17:06.617 --> 00:17:11.213
with human beings? There's no real religion anywhere,

00:17:11.414 --> 00:17:14.385
it has become like a money-orientation,

00:17:14.586 --> 00:17:18.260
or you can say, power orientation.

00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:20.580
That's why they are all fighting among themselves,

00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:25.166
and you know for definite that no religion is exclusive.

00:17:25.367 --> 00:17:29.744
But they fight. The reason is, the mind is conditioned

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:32.447
that, 'you must fight for your religion'.

00:17:32.648 --> 00:17:35.408
Now, they have no religion within;

00:17:35.609 --> 00:17:39.353
there's no religion that is working out in their lives.

00:17:39.554 --> 00:17:45.431
They might be the most corrupt, most immoral people,

00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:49.876
but they belong to a particular religion, like a club.

00:17:50.077 --> 00:17:55.548
And then they start, you see, identifying themselves as something,

00:17:55.749 --> 00:17:58.189
and they have a right to do these things,

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:02.337
because they belong to a particular religion or to cult,

00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:04.538
and this and that.

00:18:04.913 --> 00:18:09.610
Now, there are people who can really use this mind,

00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:11.818
though it is artificial.

00:18:12.019 --> 00:18:15.102
In modern times, we are using so many artificial things

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:20.141
and this artificiality can creep into everything, like plastic.

00:18:20.342 --> 00:18:23.977
So, this mind can penetrate into anything

00:18:24.178 --> 00:18:26.649
and it penetrates into the minds of people.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:31.938
That's how Hitler managed all the young people of Germany.

00:18:32.139 --> 00:18:37.571
All these people who have been able to destroy.

00:18:37.772 --> 00:18:45.457
The reasoning which is logical, not through the mind.

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:49.301
If it is through the mind it's no logic.

00:18:49.502 --> 00:18:56.791
It is just a reasoning that we can see clearly stupidity.

00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:04.122
Because this mind, which is just a bubble, as I told you,

00:19:04.323 --> 00:19:09.560
and is so limited, that it cannot comprehend

00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:15.589
the beauty, the glory, the expanse of reality.

00:19:16.464 --> 00:19:21.326
This mind is just a collection of all the garbage, we should say,

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:25.084
which we have to, somehow or other, deny

00:19:25.285 --> 00:19:29.873
and tell ourselves that, “I have to go beyond my mind.

00:19:30.074 --> 00:19:35.777
So-called mind of mine has done no good for me.

00:19:40.043 --> 00:19:47.880
And this mind of mine, which has been all the time controlling me,

00:19:48.081 --> 00:19:51.641
is just like the watch we have made and it is controlling us,

00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:56.115
or like the computer that controls us.”

00:19:56.881 --> 00:19:59.461
So we have to be careful

00:19:59.662 --> 00:20:02.297
that we are the ones who have created this mind,

00:20:02.498 --> 00:20:06.810
and this mind has no business to control us.

00:20:07.357 --> 00:20:10.304
Many people try to control the mind.

00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:14.390
There's a way of doing it that, “I’ll control my mind now.”

00:20:14.591 --> 00:20:18.210
Now, try to understand, how will you control the mind?

00:20:18.411 --> 00:20:20.694
Only through mind.

00:20:20.895 --> 00:20:23.561
Either by ego or by your conditioning.

00:20:23.762 --> 00:20:27.350
You have no means of controlling your mind,

00:20:27.551 --> 00:20:31.288
because it is the mind which you have created,

00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:36.617
and that is just existing there, which you cannot control,

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:40.864
though you might think, 'I can control.'

00:20:42.388 --> 00:20:48.210
You have to go beyond this mind.
And to go beyond this mind

00:20:48.411 --> 00:20:53.757
the most helpful thing is Kundalini awakening.

00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.859
Because She passes through your limbic area,

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.570
pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:21:01.771 --> 00:21:09.476
and just takes you away, out into the realm of reality

00:21:09.677 --> 00:21:18.140
and the Yoga takes place between your brain, I should say,

00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:22.320
your heart, with this All-pervading Power.

00:21:22.521 --> 00:21:26.718
She's the one which connects, She's the one who does it.

00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:29.679
Many people are doing Sahaja Yog, I know that,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.093
but it's difficult for them, sometimes to get to meditation,

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:39.148
to establish this thoughtless awareness,

00:21:39.349 --> 00:21:43.632
which is an extremely important state

00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:46.718
which you all should achieve.

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:50.741
So many Sahaja Yogis are there, and I'm happy to know that

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.942
they are getting deeper and deeper,

00:21:53.143 --> 00:21:57.411
but as long as they are in the turmoil of their mind

00:21:57.612 --> 00:22:00.145
they cannot progress.

00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:07.645
Whatever is created out of their mind has no reality in it,

00:22:07.846 --> 00:22:15.622
is very limited, and is also, sometimes very repulsive,

00:22:15.823 --> 00:22:17.823
because with this mind people start thinking,

00:22:18.024 --> 00:22:20.024
“I am such and such”, you know.

00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:23.075
Now you become, supposing, I don't know what, position,

00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:27.341
but supposing you become the Governor,

00:22:27.542 --> 00:22:29.542
then you think you can do what you like,

00:22:29.743 --> 00:22:31.446
because you have become the Governor.

00:22:31.647 --> 00:22:34.571
This mind doesn't know that you have become the Governor,

00:22:34.772 --> 00:22:37.227
you are not the Governor.

00:22:37.428 --> 00:22:39.428
This governorship is ruling you,

00:22:39.629 --> 00:22:42.725
not that you are ruling the governorship.

00:22:42.926 --> 00:22:46.178
Once these ideas come into your head,

00:22:46.379 --> 00:22:50.295
you start behaving in a manner in which you should not behave.

00:22:50.496 --> 00:22:53.600
Even among Sahaja Yogis there are leaders.

00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:57.030
Leaders also start sometimes thinking, 'Ah, I'm a leader'.

00:22:57.231 --> 00:22:59.231
It's a myth, absolute myth,

00:22:59.432 --> 00:23:01.794
leadership in Sahaja Yoga is an absolute myth,

00:23:01.995 --> 00:23:05.552
which you should know. But once they know they are leaders, see,

00:23:05.753 --> 00:23:15.007
they become, sort of absolutely mindful

00:23:15.208 --> 00:23:17.851
and full of thoughts.

00:23:18.052 --> 00:23:25.637
Thoughts how to dominate, how to control.

00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:29.856
When they start controlling others, then you must know that

00:23:30.057 --> 00:23:33.653
it is the mind which is telling them to control.

00:23:33.854 --> 00:23:37.481
Why to control anyone? If you are a real Sahaja Yogi,

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:40.660
there is no need to control.

00:23:40.861 --> 00:23:43.941
There is no need to maneuver, to manipulate.

00:23:44.142 --> 00:23:48.871
Now, once your attention goes beyond the mind,

00:23:49.072 --> 00:23:54.910
only the Sahaj Yogis will understand this point very clearly,

00:23:55.111 --> 00:23:59.762
when this mind goes beyond the thoughts

00:23:59.963 --> 00:24:06.306
then the manipulation of the attention is very important.

00:24:06.877 --> 00:24:09.582
Then whatever you manipulate,

00:24:09.783 --> 00:24:15.259
means you take this attention to this or to that or to that.

00:24:15.627 --> 00:24:19.114
You’ll be surprised how dynamic you become,

00:24:19.315 --> 00:24:25.213
how effective you become, and how knowledgeable you become.

00:24:25.604 --> 00:24:27.864
Because, once

00:24:28.065 --> 00:24:32.653
you can take this attention to anything you want,

00:24:32.854 --> 00:24:36.733
immediately there is light on that issue, on that person,

00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:39.233
on that problem,

00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:45.616
and you see how it works out, how it helps.

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:47.817
In Sahaja Yoga you have said, “Mother,

00:24:48.018 --> 00:24:51.395
there have been lots of miracles with Your Attention”,

00:24:51.596 --> 00:24:53.965
or something like that. I agree,

00:24:54.166 --> 00:24:58.582
but your attention also is quite capable of doing things

00:24:58.783 --> 00:25:01.066
which normal people can't do,

00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:04.175
because now your attention is purified, firstly,

00:25:04.376 --> 00:25:09.769
and secondly it is manipulated with the Divine Power,

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:15.438
and is manifesting its powers.

00:25:16.368 --> 00:25:19.886
But, before that I have seen people who come to Sahaja Yog,

00:25:20.087 --> 00:25:23.230
they send me letters of crying, 'Mother, this is happening,

00:25:23.431 --> 00:25:28.207
that is happening, my father is sick and my leg is paining,

00:25:28.408 --> 00:25:30.746
my hands are paining', all kinds of things,

00:25:30.947 --> 00:25:33.436
not only at the physical level, but also on mental level,

00:25:33.637 --> 00:25:35.637
and all sorts of things, they go on.

00:25:35.838 --> 00:25:38.051
They sometimes write to Me such long letters,

00:25:38.252 --> 00:25:40.371
I don't know how to write it back.

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:44.402
There's nothing to write so much.

00:25:44.603 --> 00:25:48.816
But they do, because at that stage they are still reacting,

00:25:49.017 --> 00:25:51.622
and they don't know what to do. They go to such a limit,

00:25:51.823 --> 00:25:54.231
that they think that Sahaja Yoga is like a contract.

00:25:54.432 --> 00:25:57.325
'Now I've come to Sahaja Yog, I must get this.

00:25:57.526 --> 00:25:59.526
This must happen. Only they come to Sahaja Yog,

00:25:59.727 --> 00:26:02.737
then they think it's a contract, and they must get this,

00:26:02.938 --> 00:26:04.938
and they must get that help.

00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:11.165
All this kind of behavior is not that of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:26:11.374 --> 00:26:15.376
Sahaj Yogi, in Sanskrit, is a very good word, Datasta.

00:26:15.577 --> 00:26:18.235
Is a very good word, which I'll try to explain,

00:26:18.436 --> 00:26:24.813
but cannot be really translated.

00:26:25.014 --> 00:26:30.118
Datasta means the one who is standing on the shore,

00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:34.016
on the shore and watching.

00:26:34.217 --> 00:26:37.649
That is the state in which you have to be.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:43.646
But, as a result, you do not become a person who is not effective.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.063
You become extremely effective.

00:26:47.264 --> 00:26:49.712
If such people are there,

00:26:49.913 --> 00:26:53.525
you won't believe so many things can happen.

00:26:53.726 --> 00:26:56.384
Wars can stop,

00:26:56.585 --> 00:26:59.454
peace can spread,

00:26:59.655 --> 00:27:03.774
people who are evil will be exposed.

00:27:03.975 --> 00:27:10.446
Now, because it's such an en-masse working out of Sahaja Yog,

00:27:10.647 --> 00:27:14.923
Sahaja Yogis should not, in any way,

00:27:15.124 --> 00:27:18.782
find themselves in conflict with each other.

00:27:18.983 --> 00:27:22.399
Still, I find sometimes. And I'm amazed,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.946
how people criticize other Sahaja Yogis, or other leaders,

00:27:26.147 --> 00:27:29.009
while they themselves have problems.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:33.384
The reason is that once you start going beyond the mind,

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:37.243
you automatically become introspective.

00:27:37.444 --> 00:27:39.493
And you start seeing, 'What's wrong with me,

00:27:39.694 --> 00:27:42.587
this mind of mine, now?'

00:27:42.788 --> 00:27:44.788
So, better stand before the mirror,

00:27:44.989 --> 00:27:48.186
or can even close your eyes and say, “Now, Mr. Mind,

00:27:48.387 --> 00:27:50.881
what are you doing?

00:27:51.082 --> 00:27:53.082
What are you up to?”

00:27:53.283 --> 00:27:56.756
You face yourself, you stand out from yourself,

00:27:56.957 --> 00:28:03.097
and see for yourself and ask the mind, “What are you up to?"

00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:07.741
That's the way, once you are out of it you can control it.

00:28:07.942 --> 00:28:10.249
I'm happy you are celebrating My Birthday.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.608
Now I'm supposed to be quite old, though I don't think like that,

00:28:13.809 --> 00:28:15.809
because I don't think.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:21.028
One has to be beyond, beyond the mind.

00:28:21.229 --> 00:28:23.653
To think about yourself all the time

00:28:23.854 --> 00:28:27.231
or to think about things

00:28:27.432 --> 00:28:30.254
which do not concern you sometimes, you know.

00:28:30.455 --> 00:28:33.934
And just try to put your mind into a turmoil,

00:28:34.135 --> 00:28:38.838
It is very dangerous these days.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.510
To stop your thought, first of all,

00:28:41.711 --> 00:28:44.979
I think in Sahaja Yoga you should stop reading anything.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.713
Because if you start reading, then what happens again,

00:28:48.914 --> 00:28:51.690
you start collecting thoughts from that book.

00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:53.891
I've seen many people

00:28:54.092 --> 00:28:56.946
whose mind is nothing but the books from others,

00:28:57.147 --> 00:29:00.462
or the words of others, or quotation of others.

00:29:00.663 --> 00:29:02.900
They are nowhere. You cannot find them.

00:29:03.101 --> 00:29:07.580
They are all lost people, “He says so and that one say so."

00:29:07.781 --> 00:29:09.781
When I was writing this book,

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:13.078
which you know that I have written down, they were saying,

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:19.351
“Mother, but Plato said like this, and Rousseau said like that.”

00:29:19.552 --> 00:29:21.976
I said, “Let them say whatever they wanted to,

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:25.393
I'll say what I know. Why should I refer to them.

00:29:25.594 --> 00:29:27.596
I don't have to go to the libraries and read

00:29:27.797 --> 00:29:32.259
what Rousseau said, what Plato said, what - nothing.”

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.048
What I know, whatever I have witnessed in My life,

00:29:36.249 --> 00:29:38.978
I should write it.

00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:43.056
Clearly, without thinking about what others have to say,

00:29:43.257 --> 00:29:45.712
what others have described.

00:29:45.913 --> 00:29:49.790
And also another, this mind has another big, big problem,

00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:55.118
that whatever is written down in black and white becomes Bible.

00:29:55.319 --> 00:30:00.563
Then, whatever is done before

00:30:00.764 --> 00:30:05.719
is something great. Like, now there is no Christ,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.211
there is no Mohammed Sahib, and there is no Abraham.

00:30:11.412 --> 00:30:15.164
There's no Krishna, there's no Ram today.

00:30:15.365 --> 00:30:19.547
But they will think of what Rama said, what Krishna said,

00:30:19.748 --> 00:30:23.336
then in Gita, this He said, in Gita He has not said a word

00:30:23.537 --> 00:30:28.216
about Kundalini, so why Mother is talking about Kundalini?

00:30:28.639 --> 00:30:31.719
He might have said – can't say – who wrote Gita?

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.781
Never Sri Krishna. Christ never wrote Bible.

00:30:35.982 --> 00:30:38.813
Koran was not written by Mohammed Sahib.

00:30:39.014 --> 00:30:43.717
So, what they have said – why should you worry about that?

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:48.063
Instead of that, you take the experience that everybody has said.

00:30:48.264 --> 00:30:51.282
That, “You are to be born again”, everybody has said.

00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:54.852
That, “You have to go beyond the mind”, also everyone has said.

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:58.641
Why not do that and then see for yourself?

00:30:58.842 --> 00:31:00.860
But people like, and they're identified.

00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:03.665
Now, if they are Christians, who are coming to Sahaj Yoga,

00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:08.392
still they are happy if it is Christ, very identified,

00:31:08.593 --> 00:31:12.525
if they are Hindus should be Krishna, or Rama maybe.

00:31:12.726 --> 00:31:16.205
If they are Muslims, it should be Mohammed Sahib, Fatima or someone.

00:31:16.406 --> 00:31:19.205
Otherwise, they can't get out of it, this is very difficult.

00:31:19.406 --> 00:31:23.626
Their mind is such that is so much made, from childhood,

00:31:23.827 --> 00:31:25.278
you are told, “You are a Muslim, you are a Muslim,

00:31:25.479 --> 00:31:28.432
you are a Christian, you are a Christian”, so they believe it.

00:31:28.633 --> 00:31:31.251
Supposing you are born in some other religion

00:31:31.452 --> 00:31:34.876
then what would have happened?

00:31:35.077 --> 00:31:37.173
You would have believed something different,

00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:41.712
but this mind has been injected with the ideas

00:31:41.913 --> 00:31:43.913
which has gone into your head

00:31:44.114 --> 00:31:50.319
and that's how you are so much without any freedom.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.671
You are tied down with these conditionings.

00:31:53.872 --> 00:31:58.382
And that's what I find among Sahaja Yogis also,

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:03.007
a very big conditioning that

00:32:03.208 --> 00:32:10.948
such and such thing is good or bad, they decide.

00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:15.909
You see for yourself. For example, if I talk on Guru Nanak,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.722
then the Sikhs will be very happy,

00:32:18.923 --> 00:32:22.331
but I talk on Christ, they won't be happy.

00:32:22.532 --> 00:32:25.526
I talked on Christ in Poona, so they said,

00:32:25.727 --> 00:32:28.331
“She's trying to convert everybody to Christianity”,

00:32:28.532 --> 00:32:32.706
and when I was talking about Shri Krishna in London,

00:32:32.907 --> 00:32:37.034
they said, “She's making everybody a Hindu.”

00:32:37.235 --> 00:32:41.682
So this identification that we have

00:32:41.883 --> 00:32:47.187
is coming to us when so intensely, from,

00:32:47.388 --> 00:32:50.143
we should say, it's like from the birth.

00:32:50.344 --> 00:32:54.081
All these ideas still are there and we are not free.

00:32:54.282 --> 00:32:57.917
That doesn't mean that you should not have faith in all of these people.

00:32:58.118 --> 00:33:02.112
They were all great, we have great respect for them and understanding.

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:08.620
But first you be free, you be free to know them.

00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:11.979
Your mind should be free. It should not be the injections

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.034
that are put into your heads, that you cannot see the point.

00:33:16.235 --> 00:33:18.384
That's why they don't enjoy also, I've seen,

00:33:18.585 --> 00:33:22.697
partly they enjoy, partly they don't.

00:33:22.898 --> 00:33:25.049
So, to become a free person,

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.572
because Sahaj Yoga is to give you complete freedom,

00:33:29.773 --> 00:33:33.892
and also complete sense of freedom,

00:33:34.093 --> 00:33:36.822
so you respect the freedom of others,

00:33:37.023 --> 00:33:40.338
on the whole you understand what freedom is.

00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:47.273
If that doesn't work out, then I would
say that Sahaja Yoga is of no use,

00:33:47.474 --> 00:33:50.546
because it should work out in such a manner that

00:33:50.747 --> 00:33:56.593
you should get rid of all these conditionings you have had.

00:33:56.794 --> 00:34:02.234
Now, take the second enemy of ours – is Mr. Ego,

00:34:02.435 --> 00:34:04.435
which is another headache,

00:34:04.636 --> 00:34:08.748
and which works very fast in many countries

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:13.240
where already ego has been bloated.

00:34:13.441 --> 00:34:16.327
See these balloons.

00:34:16.528 --> 00:34:18.733
If they were bloated, all right,

00:34:18.934 --> 00:34:22.960
it’s very easy to again make them big,

00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:26.278
but if they were never done that, then it's difficult,

00:34:26.479 --> 00:34:29.075
you have to pull it out, you have to put it to the pumps,

00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:31.747
otherwise it won't be bloated.

00:34:31.948 --> 00:34:36.364
Now, this ego comes to us from different, different angles,

00:34:36.565 --> 00:34:39.677
and it - actually, you'll be surprised,

00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:42.724
from the deformity of our chakras.

00:34:42.925 --> 00:34:47.607
For some people, money is very important.

00:34:47.808 --> 00:34:49.808
We must get money, somehow or other.

00:34:50.009 --> 00:34:52.386
If I don't get money, what's the use of being in Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:52.587 --> 00:34:55.214
Money is very important.

00:34:55.415 --> 00:34:58.862
We are living in a money-oriented world, no doubt.

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:02.487
But I have told you that what's the use of having money

00:35:02.688 --> 00:35:06.126
that makes you a fool, which takes you –

00:35:06.327 --> 00:35:11.423
now, see the countries which are very much money- oriented,

00:35:11.624 --> 00:35:14.001
who are supposed to be very rich,

00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:17.712
all the Scandinavian countries and Switzerland,

00:35:17.913 --> 00:35:21.098
whatever may be have, they might have done to get that money,

00:35:21.299 --> 00:35:24.161
doesn't matter, but they are people with money.

00:35:24.362 --> 00:35:27.265
People are committing suicide, young people are committing suicide,

00:35:27.466 --> 00:35:30.804
there's a competition going on, they're very unhappy. Why?

00:35:31.005 --> 00:35:34.515
That means money cannot bring happiness.

00:35:34.716 --> 00:35:39.171
Money, money, money, money, if that goes into your head also,

00:35:39.372 --> 00:35:42.507
then you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:35:42.708 --> 00:35:49.093
But the money is there just for you to use it

00:35:49.294 --> 00:35:53.098
to express your love.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:59.890
Now, you go to the shop.

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.624
Then you see something, "Aaaah!

00:36:02.825 --> 00:36:09.801
This is very nice to be given to such and such person."

00:36:10.263 --> 00:36:13.429
You think like that. It's a very sweet feeling you get there.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:17.696
Ah - you can give this to this one, eh? He needs it very much.

00:36:17.897 --> 00:36:22.180
When your mind becomes the other way round,

00:36:22.381 --> 00:36:24.664
I mean, when it is thoughtlessly aware,

00:36:24.865 --> 00:36:30.258
then you will buy something that is joy giving,

00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:35.078
something artistic, something beautiful,

00:36:35.279 --> 00:36:40.294
something useful to that person.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:48.344
It will be a kind of a mind that will be extremely full of generosity,

00:36:48.545 --> 00:36:51.125
enjoying its generosity.

00:36:51.326 --> 00:36:55.180
And all the time it will guide you

00:36:55.381 --> 00:37:03.061
to the projection of your attention to things

00:37:03.262 --> 00:37:08.613
by which you can give happiness to others.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:14.001
Small, small things, not necessarily expensive things.

00:37:14.202 --> 00:37:18.040
If you have money better spend money in buying things

00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:25.618
that you can give to others, that you can express your love,

00:37:25.819 --> 00:37:30.115
your gratitude, your Shraddha.

00:37:30.647 --> 00:37:37.891
It is very remarkable how people give money to these sadhus and babas

00:37:38.092 --> 00:37:40.092
in thousands and thousands and crores of it.

00:37:41.756 --> 00:37:45.719
Because, I think in them it has come that

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.373
to satisfy their Shraddha

00:37:48.574 --> 00:37:51.578
they must give it, and so they give.

00:37:51.779 --> 00:37:56.101
And they have amassed and amassed so much money,

00:37:56.302 --> 00:38:00.458
they have no sense of it. They don't understand the value of that.

00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:03.216
To them it is nothing but money.

00:38:03.417 --> 00:38:09.505
So, in the modern times I think the worst thing of ego is money.

00:38:09.706 --> 00:38:11.972
I have seen people who are very rich,

00:38:12.173 --> 00:38:16.097
supposed to be great business walahs and something like that,

00:38:16.298 --> 00:38:18.420
they must meet Me separately,

00:38:18.621 --> 00:38:23.574
“We must come, Mother, and see You.”

00:38:24.582 --> 00:38:28.483
But they're useless people, absolutely useless.

00:38:28.684 --> 00:38:31.644
So they'll come and tell Me, “You know, I’m having a loss in this,

00:38:31.845 --> 00:38:33.845
I'm having a loss in that,

00:38:34.092 --> 00:38:38.435
can you help us in this way or that way?”

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.394
I just don't say anything to them, but they have said,

00:38:41.595 --> 00:38:43.696
“Mother we have recovered because of Your blessings.” Maybe.

00:38:46.322 --> 00:38:48.738
But it’s stupid.

00:38:48.939 --> 00:38:54.504
Like Lao-Tse described that you are going through the Yangtse river,

00:38:54.705 --> 00:38:59.356
it's beautiful. On the sides you see beautiful scenes,

00:38:59.557 --> 00:39:04.489
but you better be on the boat and reach the ocean.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.528
In the same way, supposing we have to catch a plane,

00:39:07.729 --> 00:39:09.755
and we see something very nice on the road

00:39:09.956 --> 00:39:14.802
and get down there, how can we catch the plane?

00:39:15.003 --> 00:39:20.177
So these side-effects of this mind are these,

00:39:20.378 --> 00:39:24.927
that we divert our attention to wrong things

00:39:25.128 --> 00:39:28.615
and waste our energy into it. Ultimately we are not happy,

00:39:28.816 --> 00:39:33.599
as you know that the - in general - wants are not satiable.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:41.771
It’s the love that you give and the love that you receive,

00:39:41.972 --> 00:39:46.052
which is not a love which is entangled into anything

00:39:46.253 --> 00:39:49.060
with any purpose, with any idea,

00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:54.193
but just to feel that love,

00:39:54.394 --> 00:40:01.709
pure love within yourself and within others.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.990
Is the greatest gift of the Divine.

00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:10.021
All other things are useless, you'll find it.

00:40:10.222 --> 00:40:13.005
You find it every day. Today you want to have a car,

00:40:13.206 --> 00:40:15.392
all right, have it. Then you want to have a house, have it,

00:40:15.593 --> 00:40:17.593
but you are not bothered about the car,

00:40:17.794 --> 00:40:19.794
now you want to have a house. Now you get the house,

00:40:19.995 --> 00:40:21.995
then you are not satisfied.

00:40:22.196 --> 00:40:26.750
Then you want to have something else and something else.

00:40:27.259 --> 00:40:32.417
So then, which is that 'want' which is satisfying?

00:40:32.618 --> 00:40:38.737
It’s this pure love, genuine love
that you feel for the others,

00:40:38.938 --> 00:40:42.750
and others feel for you.

00:40:43.547 --> 00:40:47.323
We have others, lots of conditionings of ego.

00:40:47.524 --> 00:40:52.612
In our country specially, this Indian country, India - so-called. ”

00:40:52.813 --> 00:40:57.050
You see, to dominate the wife is one of the greatest ego.

00:40:57.251 --> 00:41:01.277
I have seen people, how they tortured women,

00:41:01.478 --> 00:41:05.347
their wives and the children of others,

00:41:05.548 --> 00:41:09.868
just because they think, “I am a man."

00:41:10.923 --> 00:41:13.063
What do you get? You don't get any joy,

00:41:13.264 --> 00:41:15.347
you can never be joyous.

00:41:15.548 --> 00:41:20.777
If you try to dominate another person you can never be joyous.

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:25.793
Never be joyous. It's only through loving and affection

00:41:25.994 --> 00:41:30.395
and care that you can feel the joy,

00:41:30.596 --> 00:41:34.442
because joy has these symptoms,

00:41:34.643 --> 00:41:39.083
joy is not domination, or demanding, or asking.

00:41:39.284 --> 00:41:42.935
These are not the signs of a person who is joyous.

00:41:43.136 --> 00:41:49.748
The joyous person is that who just enjoys the caring,

00:41:49.949 --> 00:41:57.472
the loving, the gentle relationship.

00:41:57.901 --> 00:42:01.284
And this is another point where I think

00:42:01.486 --> 00:42:04.332
Indian men specially, especially in the North,

00:42:04.533 --> 00:42:07.395
because of, they say Muslim influence, whatever it is,

00:42:07.596 --> 00:42:13.153
in the North the men are extremely dominating to their wives.

00:42:13.354 --> 00:42:15.583
And they insult the wife also very much.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.466
So now the women here have become extremely dominating also,

00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:21.755
naturally action has a reaction.

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:25.458
This reaction itself is a wrong idea,

00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:29.153
and this reaction should be just dissolved

00:42:29.354 --> 00:42:36.564
into the feeling of pure love, the Ocean of Compassion.

00:42:37.057 --> 00:42:39.497
For example, I see on the streets of Delhi,

00:42:39.698 --> 00:42:42.481
so many people begging, small children are there,

00:42:42.682 --> 00:42:50.090
and all that. And now the feeling that I get is not of

00:42:50.291 --> 00:42:52.621
scolding them or getting angry with them.

00:42:52.822 --> 00:42:55.379
Maybe they are cheating, maybe anything they're after.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.580
Everybody's cheating you, and those who have lots of money

00:42:57.837 --> 00:42:59.837
are cheating you, so what is there

00:43:00.038 --> 00:43:02.038
if these poor people are cheating, doesn't matter.

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:05.571
But the compassion is built-in within Me like this that,

00:43:05.772 --> 00:43:11.766
“Let Me somehow get a plot of land somewhere,

00:43:11.967 --> 00:43:17.407
let Me organize some sort of a place

00:43:17.608 --> 00:43:22.641
where all these people who are orphans can be put there,

00:43:22.842 --> 00:43:28.459
and given all the...

00:43:31.373 --> 00:43:38.383
all the help. And maybe from this pond of misery and poverty

00:43:38.584 --> 00:43:41.805
you might get lots of lotuses coming out.

00:43:42.006 --> 00:43:45.094
But the feeling has to be collective.

00:43:45.295 --> 00:43:49.821
I feel that way, that we'll solve the problem of Delhi,

00:43:50.022 --> 00:43:53.169
but that doesn't mean that, like other social workers,

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:56.763
like I have been connected with some social workers

00:43:56.964 --> 00:43:58.964
and I was amazed that it was nothing but

00:43:59.165 --> 00:44:01.214
a ego-pampering business.

00:44:01.415 --> 00:44:03.730
It has nothing to do with social workers.

00:44:03.931 --> 00:44:12.566
Haphazard and nothing deep in their attention

00:44:12.767 --> 00:44:14.767
to look after these people.

00:44:14.968 --> 00:44:19.626
So with the great feeling of love and compassion we can do it,

00:44:19.827 --> 00:44:23.009
we all can do it, and can work it out.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:29.431
One of My desires is this. If it is a desire of you all,

00:44:29.632 --> 00:44:32.165
it will work out. It's very important

00:44:32.366 --> 00:44:37.407
that they are also human beings and we have to look after them.

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:39.608
But for that, one should not think that,

00:44:39.809 --> 00:44:44.217
“I will be the treasurer or I'll be the president, and I'll be this.”

00:44:44.418 --> 00:44:48.076
All this clergy-ship should go away

00:44:48.277 --> 00:44:52.920
from the mind itself, otherwise you are not free.

00:44:53.121 --> 00:44:57.818
You are not free, you know, like there's a nice joke about it,

00:44:58.019 --> 00:45:03.396
that – one - somebody went to see the minister

00:45:03.597 --> 00:45:09.279
and the private secretary was there, attending to the people.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.717
And he was getting very angry with them and all that,

00:45:12.918 --> 00:45:15.889
so some villagers said to him, “Who are you?”

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:22.670
He said, “Don't you know, I'm P.A.?” “Ah, P.A.”

00:45:22.871 --> 00:45:27.631
That means you are drunk, all right, we have nothing to say.

00:45:27.832 --> 00:45:33.389
So, a person with ego behaves like a person who has ego,

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:38.991
is a person like a - you can say, a drunkard,

00:45:39.192 --> 00:45:42.679
or sometimes like a lunatic also, really like a lunatic.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.749
Sometimes you have to meet them with a bargepole, I told you.

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:49.124
Some of these people who have got awards for peace,

00:45:49.325 --> 00:45:51.827
we have to talk to them with a bargepole,

00:45:52.028 --> 00:45:55.132
because they might just jump on you, just like a cat,

00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:57.655
or could be like a leopard,

00:45:57.856 --> 00:45:59.856
you don't know how they are built up.

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:02.528
I don’t know how they got these awards for peace, but they have.

00:46:02.729 --> 00:46:05.317
So, the peace is within ourselves

00:46:05.518 --> 00:46:09.114
and this peace has to be retained

00:46:09.315 --> 00:46:13.091
and introspected and seen.

00:46:13.292 --> 00:46:16.982
Are we peaceful or we are reacting?

00:46:17.183 --> 00:46:20.732
If we are reacting, then we are not peaceful.

00:46:20.933 --> 00:46:24.566
But people will say, 'Yes, yes, I am very peaceful, but I have to react'.

00:46:24.767 --> 00:46:30.480
Then you are not peaceful. Just face yourself,

00:46:30.681 --> 00:46:33.074
straightforward and see for yourself

00:46:33.275 --> 00:46:39.691
that if you are peaceful then this peace will spread all over,

00:46:39.892 --> 00:46:43.183
it will help others. It give them physical, mental,

00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:46.355
emotional and spiritual peace.

00:46:46.556 --> 00:46:49.441
So, you people have a great responsibility

00:46:49.642 --> 00:46:53.168
of coming to Sahaja Yoga. It is not just a certificate,

00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:57.658
or My badge, that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:46:58.025 --> 00:47:01.160
I would like also women to see to this point,

00:47:01.361 --> 00:47:03.848
because what I have seen about women is that

00:47:04.056 --> 00:47:06.056
they are mostly worried about their children,

00:47:06.257 --> 00:47:08.931
about their husbands, jobs and things like that.

00:47:09.132 --> 00:47:11.603
But they are not worried about others,

00:47:11.804 --> 00:47:14.462
about people who are around them,

00:47:14.663 --> 00:47:18.790
so they have to also take to Sahaja style of life,

00:47:18.991 --> 00:47:23.228
in which they expand their love,

00:47:23.429 --> 00:47:27.384
expand their attention to other people,

00:47:27.585 --> 00:47:31.236
and see how they can please others.

00:47:31.437 --> 00:47:33.970
This situation is –

00:47:34.171 --> 00:47:38.344
used to be non-existent in the western countries.

00:47:38.545 --> 00:47:42.375
I think they never knew that you should please somebody

00:47:42.576 --> 00:47:45.734
for no reward, or for no purpose.

00:47:45.935 --> 00:47:48.507
If you give any present to somebody, they'll say,

00:47:48.708 --> 00:47:50.708
'Oh. What do you want?'.

00:47:50.909 --> 00:47:54.013
'Do you want coffee, or', immediately.

00:47:54.214 --> 00:47:56.404
To them they cannot understand that

00:47:56.605 --> 00:48:00.756
somebody wants to express one's love, no, they can't.

00:48:00.957 --> 00:48:04.264
So, this – now mind has changed, because Sahaja Yogis are there

00:48:04.465 --> 00:48:06.465
and they are different people,

00:48:06.666 --> 00:48:10.153
but what I have seen before was so remarkable,

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:13.202
that they thought it was a weakness that they are giving

00:48:13.403 --> 00:48:16.483
those presents because they feel they're weak.

00:48:16.684 --> 00:48:20.663
All these ideas have changing in the West,

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:25.686
and also we should not adopt their stupid ideas that

00:48:25.887 --> 00:48:30.288
we can control people by giving them things

00:48:30.489 --> 00:48:36.851
or by giving them some sort of promises.

00:48:37.052 --> 00:48:40.919
We have, actually, to control ourselves

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:47.132
and that control can come if you do
not allow your mind to control you.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.827
That control is the complete freedom.

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:57.100
For example now, take an aeroplane which is perfectly built,

00:48:57.301 --> 00:49:02.569
which is absolutely all right. Then only it can fly.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:07.491
In the same way, if you are a perfect Sahaja Yogi

00:49:07.692 --> 00:49:12.764
then you will have no problems in dealing with any problem,

00:49:12.965 --> 00:49:19.217
with any circumstances, with any person whatsoever.

00:49:19.418 --> 00:49:22.079
There are many Sahaja Yogis in the West I’ve seen, they’ve said,

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.920
“Mother, we don’t want to take any active work

00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:27.256
because we’ll develop our ego."

00:49:27.457 --> 00:49:29.615
They think their balloon is already bloated out

00:49:29.816 --> 00:49:32.404
and if they do some work their ego will go up,

00:49:32.605 --> 00:49:36.927
so they say, “We don’t want to do.” It’s not so.

00:49:37.128 --> 00:49:40.263
Is their love. You’re working for Love.

00:49:40.464 --> 00:49:44.052
Such an Ocean of Love is within you.

00:49:44.253 --> 00:49:47.396
How can you do without that?

00:49:47.597 --> 00:49:51.427
And this has to work out at every level,

00:49:51.628 --> 00:49:57.685
whether it is your family, whether it is your city,

00:49:57.886 --> 00:50:03.498
whether it is your country or the whole world.

00:50:03.699 --> 00:50:08.076
This is the new generation we have to create of people

00:50:08.277 --> 00:50:11.279
who believe in Love which is Truth.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.451
Which is Truth. Without Love you cannot have Truth,

00:50:15.652 --> 00:50:18.412
because when you love somebody you know everything

00:50:18.613 --> 00:50:20.701
about that person. In the same way,

00:50:20.902 --> 00:50:24.060
when you love your country you know everything about that country.

00:50:24.261 --> 00:50:26.261
But first you must love.

00:50:26.462 --> 00:50:28.462
Why people are now having problems?

00:50:28.663 --> 00:50:31.032
Because they don’t love their country.

00:50:31.233 --> 00:50:34.798
If you love your country you will know what is the essence

00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:38.806
of your country, what is the problems of your country,

00:50:39.007 --> 00:50:43.657
what it is going through. And that intense feeling of oneness

00:50:43.858 --> 00:50:45.858
itself will work out,

00:50:46.059 --> 00:50:48.967
because after all you are connected to the Divine.

00:50:49.168 --> 00:50:54.115
But with intensity you should feel for all these things

00:50:54.316 --> 00:50:56.316
that are really so destructive

00:50:56.517 --> 00:51:00.477
and troublesome in these modern times.

00:51:00.798 --> 00:51:04.456
I again want to thank you for celebrating this birthday

00:51:04.657 --> 00:51:09.175
and for all the sweetness you have showered upon Me.

00:51:09.376 --> 00:51:13.191
You are just like these beautiful flowers for Me,

00:51:13.392 --> 00:51:18.918
which are anxious all the time to make you happy,

00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:21.762
to please you.

00:51:21.963 --> 00:51:24.715
Just like that I find you before Me,

00:51:24.924 --> 00:51:27.840
beautiful flowers, fragrant with divinity.

00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:33.955
I hope you all will understand your own value and work it out.

00:51:34.156 --> 00:51:36.156
May God bless you.
