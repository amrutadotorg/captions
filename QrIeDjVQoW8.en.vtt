WEBVTT

19:41.681 --> 19:49.511
Today, we have to know something about the connection

19:49.712 --> 19:54.370
of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth.

19:54.571 --> 19:56.370
It is very important,

19:56.571 --> 20:01.680
that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

20:02.579 --> 20:04.534
She has been very kind to all of you,

20:04.735 --> 20:07.331
She has been sucking your vibrations.

20:07.532 --> 20:10.211
She has been, otherwise also,

20:10.412 --> 20:15.531
She has given you everything that you see around.

20:15.732 --> 20:23.054
So today, we have to understand the connection,

20:23.255 --> 20:28.577
and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves.

20:28.778 --> 20:32.421
I have told you before also that

20:32.622 --> 20:36.023
Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils

20:36.224 --> 20:43.005
is placed within a triangular bone.

20:43.341 --> 20:49.999
Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara,

20:50.200 --> 20:57.421
and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.476
Or in the puja, it is represented as the Kumbha.

21:02.677 --> 21:05.677
I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not? Have you?

21:05.878 --> 21:10.403
Yes. The Kumbha is it here.

21:18.124 --> 21:24.532
So far, in the movement of our consciousness,

21:24.733 --> 21:34.156
we have been trying to understand the God Almighty

21:34.357 --> 21:41.219
and all other five elements that we call as important.

21:51.309 --> 21:55.568
And also,

21:55.769 --> 21:59.521
the consciousness has been moving

21:59.722 --> 22:06.138
towards the understanding of

22:06.339 --> 22:11.948
all the other four elements but the Mother Earth.

22:13.753 --> 22:17.193
That had to be such, because unless and until

22:17.394 --> 22:22.927
the understanding of all these four other elements

22:23.128 --> 22:26.458
are brought to a certain degree,

22:26.659 --> 22:29.364
the Mother Earth cannot express itself.

22:29.565 --> 22:33.919
Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up,

22:34.120 --> 22:36.903
you cannot raise the Kundalini,

22:37.104 --> 22:39.895
you cannot give Self-Realization.

22:40.096 --> 22:44.309
You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done.

22:44.510 --> 22:48.918
That’s why we had yagyas,

22:49.119 --> 22:54.527
all other methods of exciting the four elements.

22:54.728 --> 22:57.550
They worshipped the water

22:57.751 --> 23:04.579
and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light.

23:07.284 --> 23:10.602
And that’s how they came up to the time of Christ

23:10.803 --> 23:16.013
where light was worshipped.

23:18.030 --> 23:23.665
But today when we are in this modern Sahaja Yoga,

23:23.866 --> 23:26.978
we are actually at the level of the Mother Earth,

23:27.179 --> 23:29.767
because this is the age of the Aquarius.

23:29.968 --> 23:34.634
And Aquarius is the same as the Kumbha—

23:34.835 --> 23:37.509
is the Mother Earth.

23:37.710 --> 23:42.678
So we are at the level of the Mother Earth.

23:43.843 --> 23:48.970
You can also see in the consciousness of human beings;

23:49.171 --> 23:53.189
I’m saying not only men, but women also and men.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.619
The consciousness is moving more towards

23:56.820 --> 24:02.221
the feminine expression of life.

24:02.422 --> 24:04.869
But as stupid as human beings are,

24:05.070 --> 24:09.127
the feminists also have been very stupid,

24:09.328 --> 24:14.060
that they are fighting on the level of rationality,

24:14.261 --> 24:18.896
of economics, of politics—all useless things.

24:19.097 --> 24:22.013
Equality on all these things if they are to be sought,

24:22.214 --> 24:26.271
you become men, you just become like men.

24:26.472 --> 24:29.078
If you are argumentative, if you are rational,

24:29.279 --> 24:33.398
if you talk like man, it’s a masculine development.

24:33.599 --> 24:36.719
But the Mothers development, the feminine development,

24:36.920 --> 24:42.008
is not equality in the way the men have been stupid.

24:42.209 --> 24:44.930
No use competing with men in their stupidity,

24:45.131 --> 24:47.897
the amount of stupidity has been created already for us

24:48.098 --> 24:50.499
quite sufficiently.

24:50.700 --> 24:54.390
The whole world is today, is expressing that nonsense

24:54.591 --> 24:59.523
that they have—the competition, the aggression, the oppression.

24:59.724 --> 25:02.921
So the other side of the woman, which was called as the

25:03.122 --> 25:08.451
dominated one, the dark side, the oppressed and all that

25:08.652 --> 25:11.081
has to express itself in a different way.

25:11.282 --> 25:15.425
The whole mode, the style, has to change.

25:15.626 --> 25:18.292
See now, in Christianity one should understand;

25:18.493 --> 25:21.315
why Christianity, even Judaism, any religion,

25:21.516 --> 25:24.807
even Hinduism and all that

25:25.008 --> 25:27.758
but its more in Christianity, surprisingly

25:27.959 --> 25:34.133
they just had no place for Mary.

25:34.334 --> 25:40.274
And Muslims even crowned it by completely canceling Fatima.

25:40.475 --> 25:46.172
And on top of that,

25:46.373 --> 25:50.656
you will see that among Christians, I think that ordination,

25:50.857 --> 25:54.439
or what you call that, is not given to the lady to women,

25:54.640 --> 25:59.718
while Christ was not born of a man.

26:01.468 --> 26:04.884
But that does not in any way mean that you compete men

26:05.085 --> 26:10.449
in their foolish enterprises by which they have practically

26:10.650 --> 26:14.254
brought this world to such a ruinous state.

26:14.455 --> 26:20.481
So today we have to understand that it is the time for

26:20.682 --> 26:24.337
the motherly qualities to develop. Even a man,

26:24.538 --> 26:27.931
when he becomes motherly only, becomes a great man.

26:28.132 --> 26:35.017
Like Christ, when he had compassion, he was called as a saint.

26:35.218 --> 26:39.665
So the quality of a woman as a Mother—

26:39.866 --> 26:43.251
Goddess is always as a Mother—

26:43.452 --> 26:47.565
and She is the power most important to ignite Sahaja Yoga.

26:47.766 --> 26:50.659
Now how She ignites, I’ll tell you.

26:50.860 --> 26:54.268
I’ll give an analogy, but analogy should not be carried too far—

26:54.469 --> 26:58.870
as wise Sahaja Yogis you should not carry it too far.

26:59.071 --> 27:02.214
Say there is a zero, it has no meaning.

27:02.415 --> 27:05.941
In the same way God Almighty has no meaning,

27:06.142 --> 27:10.941
till you put some sort of one or two before it.

27:11.142 --> 27:13.988
It’s a zero. It has an existence

27:14.189 --> 27:18.488
but it has no capacity or a power to express itself.

27:18.689 --> 27:20.082
So it’s a zero.

27:20.283 --> 27:24.770
Like that we should say the masculine growth is a zero.

27:24.971 --> 27:27.520
Another analogy I will give you to understand it.

27:27.721 --> 27:32.958
That if you see

27:33.159 --> 27:39.161
very high power wires, going over your heads,

27:39.362 --> 27:42.961
they are absolutely harmless, there’s no trouble.

27:43.162 --> 27:47.022
In Delhi there was a suggestion that there is a very big plot of

27:47.223 --> 27:52.312
available where there are high power wires are going

27:52.513 --> 27:56.656
and we can have it for free. I asked "What is the problem?"

27:56.857 --> 28:00.374
They said only, if earth gets connected with that

28:00.575 --> 28:03.999
then you will have problem.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.589
So till these-this high power thing, whatever it is—

28:07.790 --> 28:12.269
is not connected with the earth, it has no meaning at all.

28:12.470 --> 28:17.762
But earth is very different from this dynamic power

28:17.963 --> 28:23.512
that is flowing through those wires, which are zero,

28:23.713 --> 28:26.994
which mean nothing.

28:27.861 --> 28:31.058
In the same way, in a woman,

28:31.259 --> 28:36.774
the womb of a woman is the Kundalini.

28:37.220 --> 28:40.832
Now what is a womb? Now, if that is the Kundalini,

28:41.033 --> 28:43.457
that expresses the Kundalini in the gross;

28:43.658 --> 28:47.871
that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb.

28:48.072 --> 28:51.379
Now what does a womb do?

28:51.580 --> 28:56.199
It receives the sperm,

28:56.400 --> 29:00.417
which is just a frivolous act of man

29:00.618 --> 29:03.901
or you can say just an aggression,

29:04.102 --> 29:07.870
and she then nourishes -

29:08.071 --> 29:12.409
looks after it, corrects it

29:12.610 --> 29:16.956
and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way

29:17.157 --> 29:21.409
but in a very compassionate and a sensible way,

29:21.610 --> 29:27.828
till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up.

29:29.110 --> 29:33.409
So the idea of womb is that the expression has to be

29:33.610 --> 29:38.847
in such a manner that it does not dominate.

29:39.048 --> 29:43.019
It does not dominate the embryo.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.660
If it dominates, how can it grow?

29:45.861 --> 29:49.668
So it nourishes it and makes it grow.

29:49.869 --> 29:52.363
This is what today’s Sahaja Yoga is.

29:52.564 --> 29:55.644
That now the Mother Earth is the one,

29:55.845 --> 30:01.035
who is symbolized within you as the Mooladhara,

30:01.236 --> 30:04.949
as symbolized as the AdiShakti here-

30:05.150 --> 30:08.754
is sitting down before you to nourish you,

30:08.955 --> 30:11.926
to make you grow into new personalities—

30:12.127 --> 30:15.759
into mature personalities.

30:17.080 --> 30:21.181
This concept we must understand.

30:21.775 --> 30:24.543
So the women of the West must understand

30:24.744 --> 30:27.287
that the nonsensical ideas they have taken from men

30:27.488 --> 30:32.732
must be completely discarded. They have to become women first.

30:32.933 --> 30:36.521
Those women who just are talking like men,

30:36.722 --> 30:40.498
can never help in Sahaja Yoga.

30:40.699 --> 30:45.920
They have to be like this Mother Earth who allows you

30:46.121 --> 30:48.373
to do what you like with Her.

30:48.574 --> 30:51.210
I mean you human beings have been so stupid

30:51.411 --> 30:54.140
to exploit Her to the maximum,

30:54.341 --> 30:59.732
not onlyt hat but also She

30:59.933 --> 31:02.889
bears lot of nonsense upon Herself.

31:03.090 --> 31:07.569
But then a time reaches where She becomes explosive,

31:07.770 --> 31:12.827
then She starts consuming people inside Herself.

31:13.028 --> 31:16.007
And when She is consuming people

31:16.208 --> 31:20.265
then you see the earthquakes and droughts and this and that,

31:20.466 --> 31:25.320
all these things start coming in and people get engulfed

31:25.521 --> 31:30.195
into these problems

31:30.396 --> 31:34.981
which they blame Mother Earth for that.

31:41.266 --> 31:44.198
The problems that human beings have created

31:44.399 --> 31:49.206
out of aggressive nature—even aggression towards the Mother Earth,

31:49.407 --> 31:54.034
they have to pay dividend for that. And they are paying.

31:54.235 --> 31:58.229
Now, to stop this kind of a movement of aggressiveness

31:58.430 --> 32:01.073
which brings all kinds of disturbances,

32:01.274 --> 32:05.206
one has to recede back and should develop

32:05.407 --> 32:10.120
the sense of totality, of compassion.

32:10.321 --> 32:14.722
Unless and until, you understand totality,

32:14.923 --> 32:17.050
the total, the complete, the whole—

32:17.251 --> 32:22.378
that’s the womb that’s your Mother.

32:22.579 --> 32:25.573
As long as you try to be individualistic

32:25.774 --> 32:30.268
you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

32:30.469 --> 32:34.776
You have to become one with the whole.

32:34.977 --> 32:38.522
Now we have to face ourselves for that, very important it is.

32:38.723 --> 32:42.202
Specially in the west, I would say we have to face ourselves

32:42.403 --> 32:45.390
very clearly—what are we up to?

32:45.591 --> 32:49.520
That’s a very important thing.

32:51.583 --> 32:56.520
First of all let us see where is our attention.

32:57.208 --> 33:02.468
Ask a question. We are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yogis

33:02.669 --> 33:07.132
within our fold

33:07.333 --> 33:12.390
and I am sometimes surprised that even now,

33:12.591 --> 33:16.778
the attention can be very funny.

33:18.638 --> 33:21.898
Like, simple thing, like we can have attention

33:22.099 --> 33:25.755
on material things:

33:27.115 --> 33:32.250
"this is mine-this is yours;

33:32.451 --> 33:35.492
that I should have my privacy." Then you are gone into

33:35.693 --> 33:39.398
the another realm of aggressiveness.

33:39.599 --> 33:41.718
If you try to have your own privacy,

33:41.919 --> 33:49.426
then you are depriving others of their privacy.

33:49.965 --> 33:53.337
It was all right when you were not Sahaja Yogis,

33:53.538 --> 33:55.884
to have your privacy, because you had to grow

33:56.085 --> 34:00.415
in your privacy at that time. But after Sahaja Yoga

34:00.616 --> 34:07.556
you have to become one with everyone else—

34:07.757 --> 34:10.892
that is very important. Before Sahaja Yoga

34:11.093 --> 34:16.775
you were different and after Sahaja Yoga you are different.

34:16.976 --> 34:21.916
The whole concept must change after Sahaja Yoga.

34:22.117 --> 34:25.049
That now you have become one with the whole

34:25.250 --> 34:28.354
and to feel that you are one with the whole,

34:28.555 --> 34:33.768
you should try to give up all your individualistic attitudes.

34:33.969 --> 34:40.987
That’s very common now to hear "Yes, I like this, I like that."

34:42.515 --> 34:46.120
It’s very common: "I like it." Very common.

34:46.321 --> 34:51.617
But doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to say such a thing.

34:52.688 --> 34:57.729
You see, how can I say that I like some thing?

34:57.930 --> 35:03.245
Think of a mother who has to bear the child,

35:03.446 --> 35:08.479
has to give birth to a child, has to look after the child,

35:08.680 --> 35:12.854
the needs of the child, protect the child,

35:13.055 --> 35:15.260
train the child. How can she say:

35:15.461 --> 35:19.765
"I like this" and "I like that"! Where is the time?

35:20.235 --> 35:23.354
To think what you like and what you don’t like,

35:23.555 --> 35:28.901
"I like this food, I like that food". Where is the time?

35:29.102 --> 35:32.401
Where is the energy left for that? Where is the attention?

35:32.602 --> 35:39.120
The attention is on the upbringing of the child.

35:39.321 --> 35:44.901
Now in the same way a Sahaja Yogi must know that

35:45.102 --> 35:50.174
the child within him is born—

35:50.375 --> 35:52.737
the Spirit.

35:52.938 --> 35:56.565
Spirit is the child

35:56.766 --> 35:59.385
which has been born within him,

35:59.586 --> 36:04.541
now he has to nourish, through the Kundalini.

36:04.742 --> 36:08.838
He has to water it, he has to look after it.

36:09.039 --> 36:12.541
It has to make it grow. Now where is the time

36:12.742 --> 36:15.830
for other nonsensical things? You have a child in hand.

36:16.031 --> 36:21.174
You are all mothers looking after your child—that’s your Spirit.

36:21.375 --> 36:25.166
So where do you have time for all these things?

36:25.367 --> 36:27.135
What attention should be:

36:27.336 --> 36:30.518
"What can I do to make this child happy,

36:30.719 --> 36:34.737
to make this child grow, to make this child

36:34.938 --> 36:37.589
completely manifest my self."

36:37.790 --> 36:41.128
The mother replaces herself

36:41.329 --> 36:45.073
as soon as the child becomes a mature child.

36:45.274 --> 36:47.628
So now in you, the Motherhood

36:47.829 --> 36:51.816
must take over than the Fatherhood.

36:52.017 --> 36:55.175
Motherhood towards yourself. The attitude should be

36:55.376 --> 36:58.011
like a Mother towards the child.

36:58.212 --> 37:00.675
How her attention is towards the child?

37:00.876 --> 37:05.714
You can see in every day-to-day life how we behave.

37:05.915 --> 37:10.441
I have seen people very much interested even now, in food.

37:10.642 --> 37:13.152
I mean, where is the time? Where is the attention?

37:13.353 --> 37:16.090
How can you be so much worried about your food?

37:16.291 --> 37:19.160
Worried about your sleep. Worried about your health;

37:19.361 --> 37:23.394
worried about this-that? I mean, here you are to worry about your child

37:23.595 --> 37:25.925
which you have got now within.

37:26.126 --> 37:29.672
And that’s why the child is neglected and sometimes you find

37:29.697 --> 37:34.712
the child becomes sick or sometimes goes into a coma

37:34.913 --> 37:38.501
or may die away also.

37:38.702 --> 37:42.712
So the situation is very different now for Sahaja Yogis:

37:42.913 --> 37:46.970
"how to treat themselves?"

37:47.171 --> 37:50.111
Those who are running after still food

37:50.312 --> 37:53.322
and all these nonsensical things. I mean have seen Sahaja Yogis,

37:53.523 --> 37:58.069
all their attention is on food all the time.

37:58.812 --> 38:01.330
How dedication can come in a person

38:01.531 --> 38:06.890
who is so much dedicated to food habits?

38:07.531 --> 38:11.822
Like, we have seen,

38:12.023 --> 38:15.431
you might have also seen—some of you—Ajanta caves were built.

38:15.632 --> 38:19.220
In ten generations they built Ajanta caves,

38:19.421 --> 38:23.626
ten generations! And

38:23.827 --> 38:28.235
they built it in a place where there was not even water available—

38:28.436 --> 38:31.243
to begin with.

38:31.444 --> 38:34.337
And day in and day out thousands of people,

38:34.538 --> 38:38.876
without getting any payment, without getting anything, built it.

38:39.077 --> 38:40.978
No food—no question!

38:41.179 --> 38:44.134
They used to eat some fruits somewhere here, there,

38:44.335 --> 38:49.077
but their dedication gave them power to do it.

38:50.515 --> 38:53.189
But this dedication can only be developed

38:53.390 --> 38:59.061
if you realize that you have to Mother your child.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.459
Now if the mother is ugly, the child will be ugly too.

39:06.660 --> 39:10.576
Because it is the mother who is expressed in the child.

39:10.777 --> 39:12.896
She doesn’t dominate the child all right,

39:13.097 --> 39:18.901
but she definitely can corrupt the image of the child.

39:20.105 --> 39:25.740
And that’s what exactly happens when we, the Sahaja Yogis,

39:25.941 --> 39:28.943
are not bothered as to look after our Spirit

39:29.144 --> 39:33.768
and our spiritual growth. Even now, you will be surprised,

39:33.969 --> 39:37.557
fifty percent people write letters to Me:

39:37.758 --> 39:40.635
"Mother I am still possessed,

39:40.836 --> 39:44.033
I have worked with lemons and chilies,

39:44.234 --> 39:47.447
I am coming to you for this and that."

39:47.648 --> 39:51.468
It is a very low-grade business. I think even after so many years

39:51.493 --> 39:54.781
if you are possessed, then I think you should beat yourself

39:54.806 --> 39:56.810
every day hundred and eight times.

39:57.011 --> 40:03.138
It’s a very low grade behavior, I personally think,

40:03.339 --> 40:07.053
that after your Mother has worked so hard with you;

40:07.078 --> 40:10.940
you are still just the same, coming back with the

40:10.965 --> 40:16.784
horrible idea of bringing

40:16.809 --> 40:21.097
all kinds of problems to your Mother.

40:22.676 --> 40:27.413
That means you have not looking after your child.

40:27.614 --> 40:30.686
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s not a child

40:30.887 --> 40:34.061
which is an individual child you have to look after.

40:34.262 --> 40:38.999
This is, one should understand. This is where we miss very much,

40:39.200 --> 40:42.202
especially by the intellectuals.

40:42.403 --> 40:46.374
They think it is their own child which should be all right,

40:46.575 --> 40:50.598
doesn’t matter about others’ children. Or, doesn’t matter

40:50.623 --> 40:54.775
if you have connection with others or not. It’s very common.

40:54.976 --> 40:56.766
Because, in the rationality gives them that sense,

40:56.967 --> 40:59.821
"Oh my spirits are all right, my vibrations are all right,

41:00.022 --> 41:02.654
so it is all right if I do not go to puja

41:02.855 --> 41:05.217
or if I do not go to any collective thing

41:05.418 --> 41:08.297
or if I do not support in any collective work

41:08.322 --> 41:12.318
or if I do not take any responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

41:12.519 --> 41:16.959
Because once you become collective you take responsibilities.

41:17.160 --> 41:21.545
So you are over satisfied with yourself that is good,

41:21.746 --> 41:25.725
that I need not take up any responsibility.

41:25.926 --> 41:29.100
All the Sahaja Yogis are bad, or some of them are bad.

41:29.301 --> 41:34.577
I have nothing to do with them and this is that and that and that.

41:34.778 --> 41:40.957
But in Sahaja Yoga as it is, the Motherhood is universal.

41:42.028 --> 41:50.029
Because if you are the nose, say then somebody is the eye;

41:50.230 --> 41:56.362
if you are the ears, somebody is the lips.

41:57.043 --> 42:01.944
So, it is essential for you to understand

42:02.145 --> 42:08.686
that anybody who is a Sahaja Yogi is in trouble,

42:08.887 --> 42:13.030
you are in trouble. Is threat to your growth;

42:13.231 --> 42:16.747
it is a threat to your growth, because it is the Whole that is growing.

42:16.772 --> 42:19.423
Of course, those who are absolutely useless

42:19.624 --> 42:24.353
will be thrown away, gradually. That’s what Mother does.

42:24.554 --> 42:30.330
They can be thrown away absolutely,

42:30.531 --> 42:33.400
so much far away that they will never return.

42:33.601 --> 42:36.228
But you don’t have to worry about such people,

42:36.429 --> 42:40.314
they will be thrown away. They will be given some chances,

42:40.515 --> 42:46.173
some more credits will be given, some graces will be given,

42:46.374 --> 42:49.103
but ultimately they will be thrown away. So you don’t have to worry.

42:49.304 --> 42:51.712
But you must worry about the Whole.

42:51.913 --> 42:55.884
And you have to take up the responsibility.

42:56.085 --> 43:00.282
Those who do not take up the responsibility

43:00.483 --> 43:05.868
are not the people who are yet matured their child—

43:06.069 --> 43:08.688
that’s the Spirit.

43:08.889 --> 43:12.024
Every type of responsibility that you can take,

43:12.225 --> 43:15.508
think of what responsibilities you can take.

43:15.709 --> 43:18.469
That is why most of us have bad Vishuddhis,

43:18.670 --> 43:21.375
because we do not take the responsibilities,

43:21.576 --> 43:24.422
and whatever responsibility we do take

43:24.623 --> 43:28.906
we have to be much, much, much more responsible

43:29.107 --> 43:34.536
than ordinary government servants are.

43:36.821 --> 43:41.089
Sometimes we hear from one ear and throw it away from the same—

43:41.290 --> 43:45.407
don’t even allow it to come into the head.

43:48.704 --> 43:55.417
So, one has to understand that the child is your responsibility,

43:55.618 --> 43:57.730
you have to look after the child.

43:57.931 --> 44:03.313
And the Whole is also your responsibility.

44:04.564 --> 44:10.465
Now, how to establish the connection between your Spirit,

44:10.666 --> 44:15.348
or keep the connection on between the Spirit and the womb,

44:15.549 --> 44:19.172
or the Kundalini,

44:19.373 --> 44:22.039
is the biggest problem that we all face:

44:22.240 --> 44:25.031
that our connections are very loose

44:25.232 --> 44:32.357
and that’s why this Kundalini cannot look after the Spirit.

44:32.693 --> 44:36.515
I wonder if you have noticed one thing in Sahaja Yoga,

44:36.716 --> 44:42.356
that you can maneuver the Kundalini, but not the Spirit.

44:44.451 --> 44:47.331
You can raise your hand; the Kundalini will move.

44:47.532 --> 44:49.487
You can maneuver it.

44:49.688 --> 44:53.253
You can give it a bandhan, it will go around and round and round.

44:53.454 --> 44:56.956
But what about the Spirit?

44:57.157 --> 44:59.479
You cannot maneuver it.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.481
There is only one mantra to awaken the Spirit,

45:02.682 --> 45:06.895
in the sense that to please him you have to say you are the Spirit.

45:07.096 --> 45:10.238
But you cannot maneuver it. You have to bring in Kundalini

45:10.439 --> 45:14.129
to look after it, you have to take Kundalini there,

45:14.330 --> 45:19.684
to the heart, so that this child

45:19.885 --> 45:23.684
which is the little offspring just now

45:23.885 --> 45:30.494
has to be carefully developed and matured.

45:32.934 --> 45:37.336
So on both the sides, of men or women,

45:37.537 --> 45:43.367
we have to understand, that if you are a man,

45:43.568 --> 45:48.555
and if you are dominating man, it’s all right.

45:48.756 --> 45:51.110
But if you are a woman and if you are dominating,

45:51.311 --> 45:54.298
then it’s a difficult thing for Sahaja Yoga to cure you,

45:54.499 --> 45:56.986
because you have lost your quality of being a woman.

45:57.187 --> 46:00.017
At least you have to be a woman to begin with.

46:00.218 --> 46:02.860
If you are not even a woman, then what can you do with

46:03.061 --> 46:07.998
this third persons who are neither man nor woman?

46:08.600 --> 46:11.771
Now the men, when they are dominating, they have to understand,

46:11.972 --> 46:15.443
that they have to be compassionate.

46:15.644 --> 46:19.732
They have to be kind,

46:19.933 --> 46:25.943
they have to be considerate, but never subservient,

46:26.144 --> 46:29.999
never subservient. This is one should understand,

46:30.200 --> 46:33.382
that you should not be subservient.

46:33.583 --> 46:36.515
Now the women, what they have to be;

46:36.716 --> 46:41.328
is to be great, large, receptive;

46:41.529 --> 46:44.367
receiving

46:44.568 --> 46:47.739
and nourishing all that.

46:49.224 --> 46:52.694
Now the way husbands are told sometimes in this West—

46:52.895 --> 46:56.027
I am shocked.

46:57.098 --> 47:00.397
Wife says this to Mr. X, "X you haven’t done this,

47:00.598 --> 47:02.772
X you haven’t done that. How have you put this?

47:02.973 --> 47:06.881
Do this, do that, do that." It’s not woman’s way of doing it,

47:07.082 --> 47:11.408
it’s absolutely wrong that to do it.

47:11.609 --> 47:14.997
To tell him to do something.

47:15.198 --> 47:18.786
You are becoming a manly, and then we lose completely

47:18.987 --> 47:27.329
that power of giving that nourishment of a woman’s love,

47:27.530 --> 47:30.196
which is the power of a woman,

47:30.397 --> 47:34.126
which women don’t understand. I’ll tell you a simple example;

47:34.327 --> 47:38.141
My own grand daughter. She wants to be an air hostess all the time, she wants.

47:38.342 --> 47:40.719
She says, "You must have also thought of being an air hostess."

47:40.920 --> 47:43.172
I said, "Why? What is so great about air hostess?"

47:43.373 --> 47:48.841
She says, “That’s the only time you can give food to someone.”

47:50.389 --> 47:56.071
You see a natural instinct of a Mother that let me see them eat, you see.

47:56.272 --> 48:01.178
They don’t eat themselves, they want others to eat.

48:02.327 --> 48:06.064
But this is not in the conception of the western women, I tell you.

48:06.265 --> 48:08.002
They can’t understand this.

48:08.203 --> 48:11.197
"Why? I have done this, so why not he does this, this."

48:11.398 --> 48:14.924
It’s your privilege to do these things properly,

48:15.125 --> 48:16.518
in a proper way.

48:16.719 --> 48:19.666
But supposing somebody is a very good mechanic,

48:19.867 --> 48:22.924
the woman will also become a mechanic, "I’ll do the mechanical things".

48:23.125 --> 48:25.119
She is not there for doing mechanical work.

48:25.320 --> 48:31.257
She is there for the mechanics of the emotions.

48:32.343 --> 48:34.712
On the contrary she just does the other way round.

48:34.913 --> 48:36.775
Like a man comes home; she goes on ordering,

48:36.976 --> 48:39.884
"You have to put that right, why did you spoil my carpet?

48:40.085 --> 48:44.298
Why did you do this? Clean it up, get that thing, do that."

48:44.499 --> 48:49.649
All his mechanics of emotions are finished.

48:49.850 --> 48:52.505
Once his mechanics of emotions are finished,

48:52.706 --> 48:56.180
he is useless and you are useless as it is.

48:56.381 --> 49:01.349
And men also should not do their jobs. Let them do their own jobs.

49:01.936 --> 49:06.665
I think this is one of the biggest problems of the West today.

49:06.866 --> 49:12.993
That men are neither men, and women are not women.

49:13.194 --> 49:16.134
I find the quality so horrid,

49:16.335 --> 49:19.759
that I don’t know how to deal with the mixtures.

49:19.960 --> 49:24.454
You must understand this very simple thing in life

49:24.655 --> 49:27.759
that if you are a hybrid stuff,

49:27.960 --> 49:31.454
you can’t have the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

49:31.655 --> 49:34.618
If you mix it up, it’s a very funny thing, isn’t it?

49:34.819 --> 49:38.466
So a woman must try to be a woman

49:38.667 --> 49:40.989
and a man must try to be a man.

49:41.190 --> 49:47.933
Now see, what is the situation, of a man,

49:48.134 --> 49:56.909
as a masculine effect on the development of consciousness?

49:57.110 --> 50:01.042
So, as the manliness was expressed

50:01.243 --> 50:04.985
we have developed science.

50:05.798 --> 50:09.245
We have developed all this knowledge,

50:09.446 --> 50:13.097
all these things which are outside.

50:13.298 --> 50:16.277
Now everything is ready.

50:16.478 --> 50:19.070
Now the woman has to come up.

50:19.271 --> 50:22.054
I mean, I am saying in the very abstract way; don’t think of woman,

50:22.255 --> 50:24.327
but you can say the feminine.

50:24.528 --> 50:28.405
The feminine nature has to rise now.

50:28.629 --> 50:32.748
Now everything is ready, it has to just spark.

50:33.326 --> 50:37.585
All the chakras are ready, now awaken the Kundalini.

50:37.786 --> 50:43.233
Kundalini is as important as the other chakras are.

50:43.442 --> 50:46.514
So now awaken the Kundalini. Now Kundalini’s behavior

50:46.715 --> 50:49.225
and mode of action is very different

50:49.426 --> 50:54.230
from the mode of action of the chakras.

50:57.577 --> 51:01.132
If the Kundalini becomes the chakras and the chakras become the Kundalini,

51:01.333 --> 51:06.227
how will you manage Sahaja Yoga? But we must assume

51:06.428 --> 51:11.528
our own nature in all dignity and in all pride;

51:11.714 --> 51:15.615
not to feel any way low down. Because a man sits on a horse,

51:15.816 --> 51:19.060
the woman wants to sit on a horse.

51:19.261 --> 51:22.537
What is the need for a woman to sit on a horse,

51:22.738 --> 51:25.428
I can’t understand. Here all the women are sitting on a horse.

51:25.629 --> 51:27.842
They’ll become like horses.

51:28.043 --> 51:32.631
Already I think half of your royal family looks like horses,

51:32.832 --> 51:35.576
don’t they?

51:35.777 --> 51:39.068
I think so. Their faces look like horses.

51:39.269 --> 51:42.729
See, so there is no need for women to do

51:42.754 --> 51:46.146
all the things that man have already done. Say, for example,

51:46.347 --> 51:50.646
there’s one personality of masculine personality that has to come

51:50.847 --> 51:54.263
and do a certain job. Now you’ve done it.

51:54.464 --> 51:57.027
All right now the another personality has to do this job.

51:57.228 --> 52:01.168
Now see the situation of the Divine also.

52:02.182 --> 52:05.045
Now the whole complication comes in that

52:05.070 --> 52:07.963
once a kind of a thing has been done,

52:08.164 --> 52:12.119
the another one that comes wants to do the same.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.439
Do you follow My point?

52:14.640 --> 52:19.507
So the whole energy is completely wasted.

52:20.458 --> 52:22.839
The whole preparation has been made

52:22.864 --> 52:25.577
for this Aquarius age to come in

52:25.954 --> 52:28.421
to bring in the Kundalini upward

52:28.446 --> 52:30.647
and to make the whole work out

52:30.848 --> 52:33.467
in such way that the left and right meet

52:33.668 --> 52:39.850
and you all become ignited enlightened

52:40.051 --> 52:47.186
It was a question of our being sharing the whole job

52:47.387 --> 52:49.202
in a proper understanding

52:49.403 --> 52:51.390
Now see how Mother Earth Herself was created,

52:51.591 --> 52:54.078
it is also a very simple thing

52:54.279 --> 53:02.530
First, the movement of the energy started flowing.

53:02.731 --> 53:05.796
Now this is a combined energy all right?

53:05.997 --> 53:10.405
Then the combined energy went round and round and round like that.

53:10.606 --> 53:15.389
And when it consolidated there was a-this big bang.

53:15.590 --> 53:19.006
When big bang took place—now this is the manly work,

53:19.207 --> 53:21.553
I should say in a way; manly style,

53:21.754 --> 53:25.116
because still the Mother earth is not produced—

53:25.317 --> 53:30.577
so then these little fragments again went round and round.

53:30.778 --> 53:32.874
With the momentum, they became roundish.

53:33.075 --> 53:36.218
Out of them the Mother Earth was selected for one job.

53:36.419 --> 53:39.015
Not to do anything - you keep quiet now.

53:39.216 --> 53:46.991
Alright. On the Mother Earth out of the water came the life—

53:47.192 --> 53:49.929
the carbon came in.

53:50.130 --> 53:54.249
Everybody helped there and a human being was created.

53:54.450 --> 53:57.526
Then the men went round, to improve their societies

53:57.727 --> 54:00.182
and whatever they have done to it, whatever was possible

54:00.383 --> 54:03.071
with their ego is done, finished now.

54:03.272 --> 54:08.556
Now they have done their job, you see. Now they are on dole,

54:08.757 --> 54:11.009
you can say.

54:11.210 --> 54:16.056
Now the womb, or we can say the Kundalini

54:16.257 --> 54:18.892
which has been waiting all these years, was resting,

54:19.093 --> 54:21.525
waiting for that time, isn’t it? So we call it:

54:21.726 --> 54:23.877
"the blossom time has now come".

54:24.078 --> 54:30.049
At that time the Kundalini has to rise and ignite,

54:30.250 --> 54:34.602
in such a way that the completion of the whole work takes place—

54:34.803 --> 54:38.857
it is simple. Do you understand now?

54:39.491 --> 54:43.892
So there’s no competition between men or women,

54:44.093 --> 54:47.884
but the style of work is different.

54:48.085 --> 54:52.376
If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution

54:52.577 --> 54:54.876
will take place and not turn out a rebellion.

54:55.077 --> 54:58.110
Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is.

54:58.311 --> 55:01.727
It is such a headache, that you create something,

55:01.928 --> 55:04.569
allow them to grow, and the another party comes

55:04.770 --> 55:08.850
which has to complete the job starts rebelling.

55:09.051 --> 55:13.011
So the revolution has to take place and this revolution is only possible

55:13.212 --> 55:19.899
when we understand that what part is left out now to be done.

55:22.224 --> 55:25.312
Are you getting Me all right?

55:25.513 --> 55:29.460
So that part is now Realization,

55:29.661 --> 55:32.983
our awakening of the Kundalini.

55:33.184 --> 55:38.452
For that your feminine qualities are going to help you,

55:38.653 --> 55:41.006
not your masculine qualities.

55:41.207 --> 55:44.686
So aggressiveness must be given up by men.

55:44.887 --> 55:47.139
Also, because they are Sahaja Yogis now,

55:47.340 --> 55:50.311
they have to take feminine qualities. Not of fighting.

55:50.512 --> 55:53.202
If women fight they are not women.

55:53.403 --> 55:56.507
You see, women are told that

55:56.708 --> 56:03.359
"you are useless, you are good for nothing",

56:03.560 --> 56:08.007
so now they are trying to show, ‘no’, we are also all right.

56:08.208 --> 56:13.114
If you have eaten one crow we will eat three."

56:15.074 --> 56:26.418
Now, this understanding and the wise perception would be such that

56:26.619 --> 56:29.645
"what do we have to do now to change the mode

56:29.846 --> 56:32.176
and the style of our lives?"

56:32.377 --> 56:34.879
What’s wrong here?

56:35.080 --> 56:37.270
A turning point has come.

56:37.471 --> 56:44.426
Now the evolution is not rebellion, at all by any chance.

56:44.627 --> 56:48.223
It’s a wrong idea people have. It’s not rebellion,

56:48.424 --> 56:50.756
that you hit me and I hit you—go on hitting each other,

56:50.957 --> 56:53.639
like a pendulum you move; you see the movement of a pendulum.

56:53.840 --> 56:57.412
It’s not like a boom, this thing—that today you are born as a Muslim,

56:57.613 --> 57:00.153
tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Jew,

57:00.354 --> 57:02.528
then you are born as a Hindu, then you are born as—

57:02.729 --> 57:06.841
it’s not pendulum. It is spiral movement.

57:07.042 --> 57:11.700
So every time you achieve an evolution

57:11.901 --> 57:13.888
you are at a higher level than before.

57:14.089 --> 57:17.966
So the movement is spiral—see My point?

57:18.167 --> 57:25.247
Now to achieve the higher position in our whole being

57:25.448 --> 57:27.403
what should we do?

57:27.604 --> 57:31.294
Is to understand that from this point to that point we have to rise—

57:31.495 --> 57:39.371
we have to rise in a way that we move in such a way

57:39.572 --> 57:47.779
that it is not in a pendulum way but in a spiral way.

57:48.163 --> 57:55.142
And to move spirally, you have to use another kind of force.

57:55.343 --> 57:59.962
Whatever you have used so far has to be endowed

58:00.163 --> 58:01.957
with another kind of force

58:02.158 --> 58:04.965
and that’s the feminine qualities of women.

58:05.166 --> 58:08.551
But where are the feminine women?

58:08.752 --> 58:12.707
They dress up like women, they will try to be feminine

58:12.908 --> 58:17.176
and all that. That’s not the way. From inside, from the heart.

58:17.377 --> 58:23.043
A feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life—

58:23.244 --> 58:26.629
He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot,

58:26.830 --> 58:30.520
because he is aggressive. How can he forgive?

58:30.721 --> 58:34.543
Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill.

58:34.744 --> 58:42.197
Right royal fashion, go, all right? if you are so, all right. Done.

58:42.654 --> 58:45.664
He forgave to such an extent to show that

58:45.865 --> 58:50.547
He is now giving a turn to the spiral

58:50.748 --> 58:55.680
and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings.

58:55.881 --> 58:58.868
But that doesn’t mean that you start walking like women

58:59.069 --> 59:03.819
or developing waistlines.

59:06.319 --> 59:09.384
Because that’s another stupidity.

59:09.585 --> 59:12.884
But to be Motherly.

59:13.085 --> 59:17.040
Not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly.

59:17.241 --> 59:20.845
That kindness, that gentleness

59:21.046 --> 59:24.915
should be in your behavior towards each other.

59:25.116 --> 59:29.431
Of course this force also corrects, sometimes also gets angry also.

59:29.632 --> 59:32.197
Mother also has to get angry sometimes,

59:32.398 --> 59:35.955
especially with people who never get all right with their behavior,

59:36.156 --> 59:38.494
She has to be shouting, punishing,

59:38.695 --> 59:42.978
and sometimes She also destroys; it’s all right.

59:43.179 --> 59:48.054
But that is sometimes, not all the time.

59:49.007 --> 59:54.423
So just now one has to accept that to be like the Mother Earth

59:54.624 --> 59:57.939
we have to be forbearing—Dhara.

59:58.140 --> 01:00:03.166
Daharaitey sadara. She is the sustenance of everything.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:08.322
She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in; see, talk about it.

01:00:08.523 --> 01:00:11.088
And now for the first time after Realization,

01:00:11.289 --> 01:00:15.908
you can give Her back what you have got it, from Her.

01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:18.352
You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, y

01:00:18.553 --> 01:00:23.365
ou can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower

01:00:23.593 --> 01:00:26.658
into a more beautiful flower.

01:00:26.859 --> 01:00:29.244
Now whatever you have got from the Mother Earth

01:00:29.445 --> 01:00:34.424
you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened within you now.

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:35.625
So you return Her back everything that you got from Her

01:00:37.918 --> 01:00:42.483
and give it to others. Generosity, the greatness of heart,

01:00:42.684 --> 01:00:49.663
nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love.

01:00:49.864 --> 01:00:54.124
And for the mother, to save her child, she’ll starve herself,

01:00:54.325 --> 01:00:57.960
she’ll do everything to save her child,

01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:01.944
complete dedication she has for her child.

01:01:02.145 --> 01:01:05.531
That’s a real mother—I mean the kind of mothers you see these days,

01:01:05.732 --> 01:01:08.475
neither they are mothers nor women. But what I am saying,

01:01:08.676 --> 01:01:14.707
that’s the real image of a mother, and you have a image before you.

01:01:16.787 --> 01:01:20.044
So, this is what one has to develop now,

01:01:20.245 --> 01:01:23.028
whether you are men or women as Sahaja Yogis

01:01:23.229 --> 01:01:27.208
you must develop a new consciousness of affection,

01:01:27.409 --> 01:01:30.333
love and compassion.

01:01:30.534 --> 01:01:35.138
Getting angry, getting into a temper, shouting at people,

01:01:35.339 --> 01:01:39.794
screaming at people—is not going to help you much.

01:01:39.995 --> 01:01:42.583
If you have to help the whole, the growth of the whole,

01:01:42.784 --> 01:01:47.091
try to make yourself a milder person—

01:01:47.292 --> 01:01:50.364
be angry with yourself that you are losing tempers

01:01:50.565 --> 01:01:55.044
and you are so unkind to others.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:59.935
All the problems have come out of the over-growth of the masculinity—

01:02:00.136 --> 01:02:02.498
over-growth. It reaches a certain point, you see,

01:02:02.699 --> 01:02:08.003
it’s reached such a wretched point now, that it has to come down.

01:02:11.277 --> 01:02:15.703
But also femininity, at a lower level, without Realization

01:02:15.904 --> 01:02:20.476
could be very, very small hearted, chicken hearted,

01:02:20.677 --> 01:02:25.302
could be all the time worried about her own child.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:29.257
That’s what one has to change—

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:34.320
is to have love and affection for every Sahaja Yogi,

01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:37.995
for every person. When it comes to fighting others

01:02:38.196 --> 01:02:42.597
you are all one but among yourselves you can look after each other,

01:02:42.798 --> 01:02:46.191
tell them—say for example, something is paining in my nose here,

01:02:46.392 --> 01:02:48.949
I will just try to rub it in the same way.

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:54.355
But I won’t try to cut my nose will I? Or bang my nose, I won’t?

01:02:54.556 --> 01:02:59.500
So the feeling that the other is myself; be kind and gentle—

01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:03.031
try to improve and help in that manner.

01:03:03.232 --> 01:03:05.797
I hope you have understood the whole thing.

01:03:05.998 --> 01:03:09.686
In a nutshell is that: we have to change the whole mode—

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:14.788
a radical change has to come in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

01:03:14.989 --> 01:03:20.270
Now, if there is any question you ask Me, before we start the puja.

01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:27.480
Now the problem of divorce and all that, you can see this respect.

01:03:38.588 --> 01:03:43.845
Left Nabhi problem, we can talk to.

01:04:11.344 --> 01:04:14.645
What is it?

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.259
See.

01:04:23.837 --> 01:04:28.949
This problem comes in where you are not the whole.

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:30.949
All right?

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:35.097
Now supposing, as I told you, if you are the whole,

01:04:35.298 --> 01:04:39.048
then who is the other?

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:43.323
Then you will, even if you have to hurt. Say, for example,

01:04:43.524 --> 01:04:47.511
if there is blood coming out of my thumb,

01:04:47.712 --> 01:04:51.917
I press it hard to stop the blood. It will hurt the thumb, thing.

01:04:52.118 --> 01:04:55.119
But the discrimination must be used, that I'm loosing my blood

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.618
which is precious, much more precious than this finger

01:04:57.819 --> 01:05:01.037
it will hurt.

01:05:02.561 --> 01:05:04.594
But that discretion must be achieved, you see.

01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:06.688
In Sahaja Yoga, you're all free to develop

01:05:06.889 --> 01:05:08.860
your sense of discretion.

01:05:09.061 --> 01:05:10.949
And once you develop your sense of discretion,

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:13.504
gradually you will know what to do. In the beginning you will hurt,

01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:16.145
no doubt, because you are used to that.

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:18.762
I've seen people here, just barking at each other,

01:05:18.963 --> 01:05:21.957
as soon as they see each other they start barking.

01:05:22.158 --> 01:05:24.348
You go anywhere in the whole country you go anywhere,

01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:26.567
they start barking for nothing at all. I was surprised.

01:05:26.768 --> 01:05:27.989
In a school, I went there,

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.434
there also everybody is barking at each other, you know.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:33.239
Whether they are drunk or not drunk, makes no difference-

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.082
is the same state. But after Realization, you do say.

01:05:38.283 --> 01:05:42.926
Because you feel concerned, you're worried.

01:05:43.127 --> 01:05:47.965
But you say in such a way that you achieve the result.

01:05:48.166 --> 01:05:51.004
See My point is-that is the criteria:

01:05:51.205 --> 01:05:55.064
that you should achieve the results.

01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:58.309
But, supposing a man has come for the first time, and tell him

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:01.043
that "you are a bhoot",

01:06:01.244 --> 01:06:05.371
then naturally he will be hurt;

01:06:05.572 --> 01:06:09.072
very common.

01:06:10.994 --> 01:06:14.387
First day, somebody walks in and you say "you are a bhoot".

01:06:14.588 --> 01:06:16.421
I mean, thank God if he doesn't understand the meaning

01:06:16.622 --> 01:06:20.957
of the word bhoot -then it's all right.

01:06:24.925 --> 01:06:30.052
But first you think of being gentle, nice,

01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:35.310
embalming, sweet. Let's see, find out ways and methods;

01:06:35.511 --> 01:06:38.412
there's a very good way-in the evening, to write down

01:06:38.613 --> 01:06:42.980
"how many sweet things I've said today."

01:06:48.058 --> 01:06:50.365
Not like this, sweet things we say,

01:06:50.566 --> 01:06:53.685
"You're looking beautiful" all that.

01:06:53.886 --> 01:06:58.917
Not the superficial ones. That may pamper the ego.

01:06:59.253 --> 01:07:02.224
But they're so sweet you know, things are.

01:07:02.425 --> 01:07:08.771
Let's say

01:07:08.972 --> 01:07:11.591
there are some very good words,

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:16.143
you can say, like-"Are you warm enough?"

01:07:16.847 --> 01:07:20.841
-very sweet way of asking a question. Then, it's very simple;

01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:22.801
but you can say like that.

01:07:23.002 --> 01:07:26.496
Just-it's very difficult for people to say that even, I've seen.

01:07:26.697 --> 01:07:30.043
Looking after others comforts. Somebody is sitting, he wants water.

01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:33.987
Awkwardly sitting. You just go rush and given him water.

01:07:34.188 --> 01:07:39.847
Oh that's too much to expect. That, Oh God you gave water,

01:07:40.048 --> 01:07:44.050
"I'm not his servant"-immediately the question comes into the head.

01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:48.214
Little bit trying to do something here and there.

01:07:48.415 --> 01:07:53.097
Or sometimes thinking-going in the market,

01:07:53.298 --> 01:07:56.831
you find something. "Oh let me take it for him".

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:59.164
Children do. I've seen children all the time;

01:07:59.365 --> 01:08:06.240
they think of their friends-what they can buy for others.

01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:10.481
"This is good for my friend, this is good for..."

01:08:10.682 --> 01:08:12.317
She's very fond of things, she "likes. . ."

01:08:12.518 --> 01:08:14.864
All these little-little things, you know.

01:08:15.065 --> 01:08:16.997
Sometimes even a small thing

01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:18.599
like; early in the morning you get up,

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.334
you find the another person is sleeping on one side,

01:08:21.535 --> 01:08:26.162
his blanket on the third side and his pillow in the fourth side.

01:08:26.363 --> 01:08:28.121
So you just put his head on the pillow

01:08:28.322 --> 01:08:32.613
and cover him with the blanket. That's mother's job.

01:08:35.956 --> 01:08:40.909
Not out of fear, but out of sheer love.

01:08:42.883 --> 01:08:45.674
Like even if it is cold and buttons are open,

01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:50.088
you can button up a person you like. Little-little things you know.

01:08:50.289 --> 01:08:52.901
Women have very little-sweet things which they do,

01:08:53.102 --> 01:08:59.016
which makes men very happy. But women have lost now, that sense.

01:09:03.496 --> 01:09:05.660
Not the fighting, but thinking of

01:09:05.861 --> 01:09:08.168
what sweet things you can do for him.

01:09:08.369 --> 01:09:12.501
And also, sometimes teasing is all right.

01:09:14.103 --> 01:09:17.472
Sometimes tickling is all right.

01:09:17.673 --> 01:09:23.964
But a kind of a sweet you see rapport between each other;

01:09:24.165 --> 01:09:29.938
even the feeling, that we can do that. It's a master's job.

01:09:30.642 --> 01:09:33.600
Is a master's job. The one who is a master can do it,

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.947
those who are not, will not be able to.

01:09:36.148 --> 01:09:39.688
They'll again come back to hurt. Ultimately, they'll land up

01:09:39.713 --> 01:09:42.772
with hurting or biting or coming to blows.

01:09:42.797 --> 01:09:45.745
But those who are masters will be so beautifully doing

01:09:45.946 --> 01:09:51.815
the whole job that you see a kind of a very sweet relationship-

01:09:52.016 --> 01:09:54.701
it's called Madhurya. Without any lust,

01:09:54.726 --> 01:09:58.637
without any money-business, anything. Such sweet relationships.

01:09:58.838 --> 01:10:03.142
And the joy would be bubbling.

01:10:04.291 --> 01:10:07.020
All these perversions, all these things will drop off.

01:10:07.221 --> 01:10:11.721
But a very sweet relationship-

01:10:16.799 --> 01:10:22.666
all right? Even saying that, you are feeling happy.
