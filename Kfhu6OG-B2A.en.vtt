00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:10.603
So when we talk of communications first of all the
greatest thing

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:14.995
is the communication between human beings

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:20.222
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:25.747
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:28.790
which is not true.

00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:35.507
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:42.122
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:46.382
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:54.055
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

00:00:54.588 --> 00:01:00.321
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:08.241
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:12.322
that trick one has to learn:

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:21.112
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:25.141
This is one of His special qualities,

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:31.831
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:36.035
in a very sweet manner, and

00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:45.520
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.508
Now there are many tricks

00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:56.314
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:00.274
First of all you must always show

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:05.484
that you are less intelligent than another person.

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:12.906
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:17.208
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know.

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:24.345
I'm no good for a scientist." So they feel "ahhhh, very good."

00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:37.308
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:43.644
No, I just have learned a little bit, but not much."

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.455
Musician feels very happy.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.455
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:58.610
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

00:03:01.122 --> 00:03:08.830
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:13.474
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:20.440
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

00:03:22.508 --> 00:03:30.005
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:36.041
but I would like to hear" this is first.

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:42.041
The first quality of communication is to be
extremely humble about yourself.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:46.122
The other person should not know who you are.

00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.700
And there's a lot of fun in it.

00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:59.762
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:04.041
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:09.165
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:14.175
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:17.889
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was just a

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.306
useless, small, little place meant 
for very ordinary officers because

00:04:22.392 --> 00:04:27.601
they had not allotted us any house or
anything so, temporarily, we were there.

00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:32.077
She said "what? What is your husband doing?" I said "He's
some government servant."

00:04:32.157 --> 00:04:41.220
I didn't tell her [his position]! He came down, 
so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

00:04:41.342 --> 00:04:44.175
She said "do you know him?" 
I said "He's My husband".

00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:48.255
She was shocked, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:52.174
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:54.747
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

00:04:54.828 --> 00:05:01.601
She had started looking down upon Me,
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:13.122
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.515
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:21.640
"Oh Mother
has given me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.772
This boastfullness is of no use.

00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:28.974
"I haven't got any powers you see. 
I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:32.555
But if you want I can try."

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:44.815
So play down as much as you can.

00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:48.041
Practice this at home.

00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:51.122
First practice and then do it.

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:59.297
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:04.194
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

00:06:04.275 --> 00:06:08.464
there's one is very important thing. He says 
"krodho'bhijaayate sammohah" (Gita 2:61)].

00:06:08.545 --> 00:06:13.174
You see among all the worst things that we have -

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:18.122
according to Him we have six enemies.

00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:24.740
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'.

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:28.421
He said - it starts with Krodha, means anger.

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:37.408
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:40.728
There's no need for a master to get angry

00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:43.481
because he can play about.

00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:47.074
He can make you dance like this.

00:06:47.155 --> 00:06:50.914
What is the need to lose your temper?

00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:56.208
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.041
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:05.455
and something starts barking,

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:11.668
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:18.281
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:26.174
He has started with Krodha, that: with the Krodha all problems start.

00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:29.340
from one to another to another to another.

00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:33.621
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

00:07:37.435 --> 00:07:45.007
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver - Vishnu -

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:47.793
but is expressed through Vishuddhi.

00:07:47.874 --> 00:07:51.525
The face becomes red, eyes become red.

00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:57.192
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

00:07:57.273 --> 00:08:02.359
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.625
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:11.525
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:17.321
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:21.579
Many people I have seen people say "Mother 
you know this lady is such a hot tempered women,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.177
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:30.445
But if you tell her she says, "No no, 
I don't do that way. No, no I'm very good."

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:37.169
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:40.798
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:45.660
do you get into tempers or not?

00:08:46.105 --> 00:08:51.101
Are you loosing your temper?
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

00:08:51.182 --> 00:08:54.182
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

00:08:54.273 --> 00:08:59.417
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:04.851
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

00:09:04.932 --> 00:09:13.258
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:15.439
There is no need to take to temper.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.039
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

00:09:19.152 --> 00:09:20.953
Why are you doing that way?"

00:09:21.034 --> 00:09:24.168
Now if you do something, you know, 
maybe something I might say which

00:09:24.249 --> 00:09:31.528
I would not like, so I don't want to say."
Like that - at the most!

00:09:31.608 --> 00:09:35.441
Up to that point is alright; that you should
say that, "I dislike it",

00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:38.701
but not to go further with it.

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:45.726
If you just stop at a point,

00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:52.152
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:55.692
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

00:09:55.773 --> 00:09:59.392
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:03.459
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.945
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

00:10:08.026 --> 00:10:12.926
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:18.368
you feel very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have said this."

00:10:18.852 --> 00:10:24.988
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

00:10:25.273 --> 00:10:29.091
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

00:10:29.206 --> 00:10:34.326
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:38.820
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

00:10:39.199 --> 00:10:45.391
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:51.569
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.273
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:58.179
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

00:11:01.719 --> 00:11:06.020
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

00:11:06.873 --> 00:11:12.459
you'll never feel guilty.
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.120
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:19.075
Next time you won't do it.
