WEBVTT

00:40.100 --> 00:44.960
I’ll try to cover most of the points that
you have asked but I must say that I was very

00:44.960 --> 00:52.219
happy to hear most of the questions because
that shows that your enquiry is getting subtler

00:52.219 --> 00:58.950
and subtler; that you already know about the
gross side of chakras and now you want to

00:58.950 --> 01:10.409
know the subtler forms.
Now the first question which should be taken

01:10.409 --> 01:18.030
up first, is the one, “How the chakras come
into human beings? What time? What stage of

01:18.030 --> 01:29.210
life?” because that should be the first
question. This question is something like

01:29.210 --> 01:35.400
if we ask, “What time a primule comes into
the being of a seed?” is something like

01:35.400 --> 01:43.219
that. That a human being when he dies – as
I have told you before he does not die fully

01:43.219 --> 01:54.250
– only a part of him dies which is mostly
the earth element and the rest of the elements

01:54.250 --> 02:11.230
remain there. The rest of the body disappears
and we can’t see it because it is not a

02:11.230 --> 02:26.489
complete human form. It goes on decreasing
in size and the Kundalini leaves the body

02:26.489 --> 02:41.620
and stays outside, outside the body. And the
Atma, what we call the Spirit, also leaves

02:41.620 --> 02:51.290
the body, and stays outside the body, which
is the remaining body.

02:51.290 --> 03:00.799
The constitution of this new body is different
from our constitution. We can say a light

03:00.799 --> 03:11.540
that is extinguished has all the body except
for the light. But the light goes out of that

03:11.540 --> 03:22.209
body now. In the same way, in a human being
who dies, the Spirit and the Kundalini leave

03:22.209 --> 03:33.739
the body, but they are around that body. And
it’s a great procedure that follows which

03:33.739 --> 03:45.010
is fantastic. It’s unbelievable how the
body disappears, into different elements also.

03:45.010 --> 03:54.819
But first of all let us see; when such bodies
which remain like that, they go into what

03:54.819 --> 04:04.299
you call the Pretalok. There they become seeds
or they become smaller and smaller and smaller.

04:04.299 --> 04:21.840
Till one body forms an ova and what you know
as a sperm. In one body it is formed. I don’t

04:21.840 --> 04:29.490
know if you have seen the division of chromosomes
how it takes place? It’s a complete division.

04:29.490 --> 04:36.129
If the chromosome is like that, it’s a complete
vertical division and a complete separation

04:36.129 --> 04:53.819
takes place. That is why marriages and selection
of partners, all these have a great place.

04:53.819 --> 05:02.610
For ordinary bodies it does not matter for
the Divine; they take place in such a manner

05:02.610 --> 05:17.460
that there can be at random connections established.
For example an ova of one may combine with

05:17.460 --> 05:25.370
the sperm of another. It happens at a very
lower stage of evolution; among human beings

05:25.370 --> 05:36.689
also it happens like that. For some people
who are just not very evolved, we can say.

05:36.689 --> 05:49.110
But mostly the ova rejects the sperms. It
only except that sperm which is meant to be

05:49.110 --> 05:56.780
accepted. Now it is such a minute work. It
is so fantastic that it is unbelievable. We

05:56.780 --> 06:03.020
have no idea as to how God works out in those.
It’s absolutely tremendous that even the

06:03.020 --> 06:16.800
ova, rejects, goes on rejecting the sperm
that is not the second part of itself! And

06:16.800 --> 06:21.939
that’s how so many sperms are wasted and
so many ova’s are wasted.

06:21.939 --> 06:30.270
So you can imagine that there is a tremendous
machinery, which is working out this. Specially

06:30.270 --> 06:38.050
people who are realised if, when they are
reborn, all the forces of the Divine combine

06:38.050 --> 06:47.680
to see that these, this ova is placed with
a person who is ultimately going to meet the

06:47.680 --> 06:58.039
person who has the proper sperm, so that there
is no problem as far as the meeting is concerned.

06:58.039 --> 07:01.150
And the Divine takes all the care of these
great souls.

07:01.150 --> 07:16.599
The
work of the Divine is very, very fantastic
and it is beyond human conception to understand

07:16.599 --> 07:24.770
how the awareness of God can look after all
the minute small things of the world.

07:24.770 --> 07:30.789
You cannot do even a small thing like attaching
this to this one unless and until you pay

07:30.789 --> 07:38.400
some human attention. So you can imagine the
attention of God who embeds so many seeds

07:38.400 --> 07:45.300
in this Mother Earth and gives you such huge,
big trees. I mean, you have taken them for

07:45.300 --> 07:52.729
granted, but if you watch you will see this
Fantastic, Dynamic Force behind it also, which

07:52.729 --> 08:00.710
thinks it, which does it so perfectly. But
we think that it is all automatic and that’s

08:00.710 --> 08:06.629
how we can bear it, and that’s how we can
bear Sahaj yoga also, thinking that it is

08:06.629 --> 08:13.580
all automatic.
The second question is, “When did the chakras

08:13.580 --> 08:19.520
that are in the body [get] embedded?” They
exist in the body and they go on existing.

08:19.520 --> 08:28.210
Of course they get corrected every time the
body takes birth and goes into a new seeking.

08:28.210 --> 08:37.750
And the Kundalini also, every birth you are
born, is watching you as to what you are doing,

08:37.750 --> 08:45.839
how your chakras are developing, how it is
working out. And through the method of balancing

08:45.839 --> 08:55.279
you or [your] parasympathetic system or you
can call universal unconscious, the chakras

08:55.279 --> 09:07.220
are brought to its proper shape and to its
proper condition by evolution.

09:07.220 --> 09:14.680
A man makes mistakes he makes searches, he
searches from one place to another. For example,

09:14.680 --> 09:22.560
he may start his search in money, then he
starts his search in power then he starts

09:22.560 --> 09:28.730
his search in love, I mean the carnal love,
or he may start his search some emotional

09:28.730 --> 09:38.870
expressions, then in art and all those things:
ultimately he finds that the search has not

09:38.870 --> 09:46.300
been alright because he has not been able
to achieve any state of joyous existence.

09:46.300 --> 09:50.589
And with his search these chakras go on evolving
and understanding.

09:50.589 --> 10:03.339
Now we have to know that these chakras are
absolutely living entities. Because when a

10:03.339 --> 10:15.290
person is supposed to be dead, that time,
all the Deities are not in the working state.

10:15.290 --> 10:27.209
But the living man has the chakras, which
has got the Deities, which work out the different

10:27.209 --> 10:37.759
functions of the chakras and it’s a very,
very subtle working and these can be called

10:37.759 --> 10:48.860
as the reflecting mirrors at different levels
of our awareness where the Deities, which

10:48.860 --> 10:57.070
are placed in the Primordial Being, the Viraata,
are reflected and they, once awakened, start

10:57.070 --> 11:09.620
working out the plans of the Divine.
In some of the human beings, when they are

11:09.620 --> 11:24.730
searching, these chakras find that the person
or the subject is going to the extremes of

11:24.730 --> 11:36.079
things and this comes because a human being
has got freedom to choose. And in his freedom

11:36.079 --> 11:44.610
he goes to the extremes, and by going to the
extremes the chakras get damaged. Going to

11:44.610 --> 12:01.720
the extremes is what we call is ‘sin’.
To be in the centre, to lead a moderate, simple

12:01.720 --> 12:15.910
balanced life and stick to the values of our
sustenance is the best life, but if you start

12:15.910 --> 12:24.649
going to the extremes then the sin starts.
And the sin…in the Bible it is written that,

12:24.649 --> 12:33.269
“The wages of sin is death.” So the death
occurs. Now the death actually, you know,

12:33.269 --> 12:41.029
doesn’t take place but what happens is that
the part of the chakra gets damaged. It can

12:41.029 --> 12:46.009
be a physical hankering, it can be mental,
it can be emotional, it can be spiritual,

12:46.009 --> 12:58.910
it can be anything. If you go on working out
an imbalanced solution then these chakras

12:58.910 --> 13:11.810
get spoilt at different points. That’s how
your chakras get spoilt.

13:11.810 --> 13:27.860
The chakras are, according to our awareness,
in different states. For example for a doctor

13:27.860 --> 13:37.120
or for all of us, we know that we have plexuses
in our body, we know we have different plexuses.

13:37.120 --> 13:44.899
Like you can say pelvic plexus, we have got
solar plexus, we’ve got aortic plexus, we

13:44.899 --> 13:53.129
have got cardiac plexus, we have got cervical
plexus, we have got optic chiasma, we’ve

13:53.129 --> 14:01.569
got limbic area to act, or we can say pituitary
and pineal bodies at optic chiasma, and then

14:01.569 --> 14:06.019
we have got limbic area where we have got
certain points which are active. This every

14:06.019 --> 14:11.829
doctor knows because they have even tested
the limbic area of some monkeys and they found

14:11.829 --> 14:20.319
that if you excite the limbic area of the
monkeys, with electricity, they feel very

14:20.319 --> 14:27.490
joyous.
So all these chakras, in the body of a human

14:27.490 --> 14:34.480
being, are only felt as gross expressions,
which we call as ‘plexuses’ in the parasympathetic

14:34.480 --> 14:41.399
and sympathetic channels. They are all connected
as I have told you, that the sympathetic comes

14:41.399 --> 14:45.440
from both the sides and creates the central
channel, and that is the parasympathetic.

14:45.440 --> 14:50.699
So it depends on the balance of both these
sympathetics that the parasympathetic works

14:50.699 --> 14:59.279
out well. When the balance breaks up any balance
can upset both of them, and when it is completely

14:59.279 --> 15:05.980
broken then they become on their own, and
that is how it is the complete so-called,

15:05.980 --> 15:11.259
‘liberation’ of man from Gods grace.
Once he’s completely liberated from that

15:11.259 --> 15:20.839
thing he starts falling into the state of,
as you call them rakshasas. He goes to hell,

15:20.839 --> 15:29.670
he goes to the other kind of awareness where
there is no feeling, no consciousness of conscience.

15:29.670 --> 15:36.620
He doesn’t think twice. He can kill a hundred
people without even feeling bad about it.

15:36.620 --> 15:46.170
He loses all his emotional side and also he
loses all his wisdom. What remains in him

15:46.170 --> 15:55.209
is his own ambitions and his own desires or
his ??. And he goes on without feeling any

15:55.209 --> 16:04.029
compunction or any binding from the Divine
or his own dharma.

16:04.029 --> 16:14.569
So these chakras are very important for us
because, first of all, they give us the balance

16:14.569 --> 16:26.160
for our everyday existence. They give us…
(break in recording)…God, and we can think

16:26.160 --> 16:31.949
of subtle things and abstract things. This
all comes through the help of the chakras.

16:31.949 --> 16:40.970
If you ask Me if the animals have the chakras
– they have. But they don’t have all of

16:40.970 --> 16:45.120
them separated, sometimes they are confused
chakras and all the chakras are not separated

16:45.120 --> 16:58.170
from each other and they are not all opened
out because their evolutionary process is

16:58.170 --> 17:08.520
not yet complete. But some animals I have
seen have got an awakened Kundalini and they

17:08.520 --> 17:31.570
are realised animals I have seen it. So it
is possible, even for animals, to be very

17:31.570 --> 17:37.320
[much more] dharmic than men are. And sometimes
it’s surprising how they can discriminate

17:37.320 --> 17:45.190
better than human beings can. Apart from that
animals are kept under the bondage of God

17:45.190 --> 17:52.500
and whatever their sustenance is done by them;
they don’t have to think about it. For example

17:52.500 --> 17:59.680
a dog is a dog, a cat is a cat, and a tiger
is a tiger. It’s only the human beings can

17:59.680 --> 18:07.060
be a dog, can be a scorpion, can be a snake
and can be a saint. So it’s only a possibility

18:07.060 --> 18:12.740
in the human being that you can find all the
animals existing side by side, and can be

18:12.740 --> 18:17.010
any time [that] these animals can come out
and you may be surprised at yourself the way

18:17.010 --> 18:24.830
they suddenly jump out and start barking at
you! So that is what human beings are because

18:24.830 --> 18:30.160
whatever has been in our past is within us;
whatever animals we have been is within us,

18:30.160 --> 18:37.150
so all that is there. But whatever we are
going to be also is there. And whatever we

18:37.150 --> 18:42.620
are going to achieve is also there.
For human beings the future, past, present

18:42.620 --> 18:48.630
exists, but for God it does not. So for Him
to plan and to organise and arrange is a very

18:48.630 --> 18:54.060
easy stuff because if you do not have such
demarcating things you just organise things

18:54.060 --> 19:02.860
much better. And His methods are because of
His own, I should say awareness, status, almightiness,

19:02.860 --> 19:10.380
I can say or it’s just His nature that He’s
like that, that He can manage things very

19:10.380 --> 19:15.240
well. And you cannot explain them with one
event after another event, how He has managed

19:15.240 --> 19:24.630
and how it has happened. He does it just because
He is capable of doing that. He need not do

19:24.630 --> 19:30.170
it, all that, with understanding or thinking
about it as human beings do because he does

19:30.170 --> 19:35.770
not have to think either because He is that.
He is the power and He does everything. He

19:35.770 --> 19:40.500
is the consciousness, so he does everything
without putting any effort into it. And is

19:40.500 --> 19:45.080
a very different state, which perhaps you
can understand, as Sahaja Yogis, that, just

19:45.080 --> 19:50.200
you move your hands and you find the Kundalini
moving the other side! And you may say, “Why

19:50.200 --> 19:53.700
is it moving?” after all, you must think
about it. You are realised so you can do it

19:53.700 --> 19:58.470
but not a person who is not realised; if he
put’s hand like that a hundred times nothing

19:58.470 --> 20:02.420
is going to work out. Only you can raise the
Kundalini. The reason is: your awareness is

20:02.420 --> 20:07.830
different and his awareness is the different;
your powers are different and his powers are

20:07.830 --> 20:14.500
different. So, in the same way God who is
All Powerful, for Him even [by] moving His

20:14.500 --> 20:19.440
finger He can move the whole Universe, after
all He is God. And that’s why for human

20:19.440 --> 20:23.230
beings it is said that you better have faith
in God because that’s the best way you can

20:23.230 --> 20:26.370
solve your problem.
If you go on thinking about Him you’ll all

20:26.370 --> 20:30.740
go crazy! So we have to go to a point where
we can understand Him otherwise we will all

20:30.740 --> 20:36.310
go crazy understanding Him (laughing) and
we all will become mad thinking, “What all

20:36.310 --> 20:43.510
these things! It’s beyond us, it is too
much!”

20:43.510 --> 20:49.970
But because in Sahaja Yoga now your awareness
has come really to such subtler forms, one

20:49.970 --> 21:00.350
can understand so many things and can understand
the subtler ways of God’s doing and also

21:00.350 --> 21:09.210
understand what is possible for you through
subtle methods. We can talk on subtler things

21:09.210 --> 21:14.180
but talking this to anybody who is not a Sahaja
Yogi would be something madness! They wouldn’t

21:14.180 --> 21:20.080
understand a word that I’m saying. It’s
only meant for the people who are Sahaja Yogis.

21:20.080 --> 21:26.990
So we came to a point where I said that, “In
the gross they are expressed as plexuses in

21:26.990 --> 21:33.710
the human being.” Now this is known as the
gross way. Now the subtle form you have seen,

21:33.710 --> 21:38.690
the sukshma as they call it – the subtle
form. The subtle form exists in the human

21:38.690 --> 21:44.250
being, which you can see – you have seen
it – the subtle form as energy when it starts

21:44.250 --> 21:51.760
pulsating, you have seen the pulsation. But
this subtle form is in two forms you can say,

21:51.760 --> 21:56.960
one is a sukshma and [the other is] ati sukshma
(very subtle). Because in the sukshma you

21:56.960 --> 22:21.660
can see and a person who is a realised soul,
if you are a realised soul then you see even

22:21.660 --> 22:28.550
the chakras, in the sense you can feel the
chakras on your fingers.

22:28.550 --> 22:35.710
A unrealised soul can see the pulsation of
the Kundalini and the different chakras with

22:35.710 --> 22:43.430
his own eyes, he can, if he watches it clearly
he can see the different chakras clearly.

22:43.430 --> 22:48.680
And you as Sahaja Yogis can feel them on your
fingers and also can feel them within yourself

22:48.680 --> 23:02.440
in the collective consciousness. There is,
you
can say, in the second stage of sukshma, there

23:02.440 --> 23:08.130
are three stages as you can say: sukshma (सूक्ष्म),
sukshmatara (सूक्ष्मतर – subtler)

23:08.130 --> 23:10.110
and sukshmatam (सूक्ष्मतम
– very subtle, subtlest). These three things

23:10.110 --> 23:20.770
you can see. The first stage you see is on
your fingers is the sukshmatara you can say,

23:20.770 --> 23:26.500
but with the eyes [what] you see is a sukshma
and if your fingers or on your chakras when

23:26.500 --> 23:35.690
you feel it is, you can say, sukshmatam. So
you see them in three forms.

23:35.690 --> 23:42.930
If some of the people do not feel it on the
fingers [they] can feel it on the chakras

23:42.930 --> 23:53.210
also. So you can feel it in three ways but
there’s a fourth way where you can say it

23:53.210 --> 23:58.050
is in the karana, karana state, that’s a
higher state where a realised soul can feel

23:58.050 --> 24:04.330
it, who is born as a realised soul can feel
it. And in that state they just know like

24:04.330 --> 24:10.690
a computer. They don’t bother as to which
is the one, and they don’t put hands or

24:10.690 --> 24:15.250
anything, they just feel it, it is so. As
you have seen in my granddaughter’s case,

24:15.250 --> 24:18.720
you see she just knows what is what. Just
see, you ask her, she’ll immediately say,

24:18.720 --> 24:23.060
“This is this, this is this,” like that.
It comes plain to them absolutely, “This

24:23.060 --> 24:29.590
is this.” Now you may say that how do they
know? But this procedure becomes such a compact

24:29.590 --> 24:34.830
thing, I mean it just happens to you, like
[if] you pin prick me here and immediately

24:34.830 --> 24:40.050
the hand goes back. The whole reflex action
is so quick that we can say there’s no procedure

24:40.050 --> 24:45.110
as such but it’s just a reflex action. In
the same way it acts as a reflex action; so

24:45.110 --> 24:49.040
that you don’t have to worry about the purpose
of it.

24:49.040 --> 24:55.730
That is state where we say the karana state
is reached. And the mahakarana state. Now

24:55.730 --> 25:00.600
this is the third stage is it? And even in
the karana stage there are three stages into

25:00.600 --> 25:06.990
which one feels it. Now that is, I would say
that, I need not explain because that’s

25:06.990 --> 25:20.880
beyond you people but if you are born realised
you will understand that imbalance in a personality

25:20.880 --> 25:25.890
of the three gunas is immediately perceived
by a born realised person, immediately perceived!

25:25.890 --> 25:31.600
He can see through, you see. That’s the
wisdom he has gained in his previous lives

25:31.600 --> 25:35.370
and previous births and immediately they can
see the imbalance that comes in. And whatever

25:35.370 --> 25:40.890
they say is so wise and they understand because
they can see the imbalance of these three

25:40.890 --> 25:47.210
gunas. And according to their own gunas, whichever
are [more] prevalent in them; these three

25:47.210 --> 25:55.870
stages exist in them the way they say.
For example some people are more tamogunis:

25:55.870 --> 26:01.570
means the ones who are very emotional type
people, among them some are very emotional.

26:01.570 --> 26:07.740
So they see a person through the emotions,
the way they feel in themselves. They call

26:07.740 --> 26:14.800
it a feeling. “I had a feeling for such
a person. I felt that way.” That is the

26:14.800 --> 26:19.910
word they use.
But supposing the person is a rajoguni, he

26:19.910 --> 26:28.310
has been working on the rajoguna like praying
to Surya and doing Gayatri [mantras] and praying

26:28.310 --> 26:35.370
to all the heavenly bodies and also the five
elements, like that. If he has been doing

26:35.370 --> 26:41.720
yagyas and all those things he’s a rajoguni.
Such people see them as lights, as electrical

26:41.720 --> 26:52.600
forms; so they see them as colours and things.
So one sees it as an emotional thing another

26:52.600 --> 27:03.530
sees it as a colour or you can say as any
form. They see them as forms, as colours,

27:03.530 --> 27:12.340
lights. They see as electrical currents and
some them as a different flowers.

27:12.340 --> 27:26.170
Now they are feelings and also they are these
rajoguni expressions, which you can see with

27:26.170 --> 27:33.900
your eye [like] The Creation itself.
But they are also feelings. So those who can

27:33.900 --> 27:41.000
see feelings more, a person who has been very
loving and has dealt in this side of life,

27:41.000 --> 27:46.640
who has been a bhakti man, a dedicated man,
who has been praying to God and crying for

27:46.640 --> 27:55.900
Him and asking for His help and weeping before
Him with all his heart. Such a man will feel

27:55.900 --> 28:04.590
a person more and a person who is a more dedicated
to forms and things will see them in a different

28:04.590 --> 28:10.010
way as forms, so then they see them in colours
because they’re also colours. They’re

28:10.010 --> 28:15.900
also colours and they’re also sounds.
So the sound is also one of the elements,

28:15.900 --> 28:22.580
so they can see a sound. And they also see
them when their Kundalini moves, you see,

28:22.580 --> 28:32.030
they see the sound moving. Most of the people
who have seen this have been the people who

28:32.030 --> 28:37.720
have been meditating through the Patanjali
style of meditation where they were single

28:37.720 --> 28:44.740
people Parashurama style (austere), you see.
And they saw these forms and they saw the

28:44.740 --> 28:53.770
movement of the Kundalini through the chakras,
when it passes, it creates a sound, a word.

28:53.770 --> 28:59.310
And so they studied every sound how, which
sound was created, what sound was created

28:59.310 --> 29:05.740
what colour was there. And so it is the one-sided
knowledge of the right-hand side, of the people

29:05.740 --> 29:10.000
who went to the right-hand side that they
say that, “This thing was created, that

29:10.000 --> 29:14.110
thing was created and then this sound was
created.”

29:14.110 --> 29:17.810
Then they formed the language – it’s the
original Sanskrit language which was formed.

29:17.810 --> 29:22.290
That’s why it’s called as a Devavani.
And that’s why these Deities understand

29:22.290 --> 29:27.990
Sanskrit the best. When you say Sanskrit mantras
you see, they absolutely understand them very

29:27.990 --> 29:33.750
fast because this has come originally from
there. They studied that and then it closed

29:33.750 --> 29:42.750
off. But other languages in India, most of
the languages, were taken from Sanskrit converted

29:42.750 --> 29:47.660
into something else, brought to another form
and then another Sanskrit came in – Takruta

29:47.660 --> 29:53.230
Sanskrit, then these five languages – Magadi,
Paishachi, Marathi, all these languages came

29:53.230 --> 29:58.980
in. So it is derivation [of Sanskrit]. Other
languages in other countries that came up

29:58.980 --> 30:09.290
was also of course the expression of the Kundalini,
but they learnt it more from say, the words

30:09.290 --> 30:16.400
came from the outside; the sound of the air
flowing they call it ‘ssss’, so they call

30:16.400 --> 30:20.610
it ’s’ like that. And from the nature
what ever they learnt from outside, because

30:20.610 --> 30:27.780
the approach has been more objective; so objective
approach is always little less than the subjective

30:27.780 --> 30:32.500
because subjective is from inside and objective
is from outside. So when you go from the objective,

30:32.500 --> 30:39.490
the deviation into the main sound that are
coming from the inside, the purity is little

30:39.490 --> 30:43.930
bit deviated. And you know what is objective
and subjectivity approach.

30:43.930 --> 30:49.810
So this has happened with some languages.
Some languages are very, very close to Sanskrit

30:49.810 --> 30:55.960
but they too took a turn according to their
gunas.

30:55.960 --> 31:04.370
Now, the Satvaguni (सत्त्वगुणि),
the central path or the Satvaguni as they

31:04.370 --> 31:13.730
call it, they are also the people who have
Satvaguna more in them; they see chakras in

31:13.730 --> 31:20.810
the right form. But Satvagunis should not
be confused with the people who believe that

31:20.810 --> 31:24.190
if you eat this then this is satvik (centred),
if you eat that that is tamasik (left-sided)

31:24.190 --> 31:31.760
or if you say this, this is satvik or if you
do not kill anybody then it is satvik. In

31:31.760 --> 31:39.830
this the right perception comes in. For example,
you have to explain why Krishna killed so

31:39.830 --> 31:47.760
many rakshasas. It was absolutely satva; is
dharmic, absolutely dharmic. Why Durga killed

31:47.760 --> 31:54.920
so many rakshasas? She had to eat the blood
of so many rakshasas.

31:54.920 --> 32:05.700
So whatever is dharmic, the wisdom, the right
path comes through such people who are neither

32:05.700 --> 32:17.170
too much this side, neither that side and
they know exactly what is the right way of

32:17.170 --> 32:22.280
looking at life.
Such born realised people: this is a very,

32:22.280 --> 32:28.880
very far-fetched stuff they are very few.
I would say perhaps you can say Buddha and

32:28.880 --> 32:41.150
Mahavira are the only two human beings who
have gone through many lives, from one extreme

32:41.150 --> 32:48.910
to another they went and ultimately they found
out that going to the extremes is not proper.

32:48.910 --> 32:54.940
Still they have not reached the complete height
of an incarnation.

32:54.940 --> 33:03.380
So a model was to be created who would all
the time be giving a fixed point for a person

33:03.380 --> 33:10.240
to rise to that. And these are the different
models which are placed within us on our chakras.

33:10.240 --> 33:23.100
And these models are perfect points belonging
to those chakras. So according to the nature

33:23.100 --> 33:31.540
of the person who is watching these chakras,
one sees them and gives them importance also.

33:31.540 --> 33:39.440
Now for a person like say, [Adi] Shankacharya:
Shankacharya is a born realised soul many

33:39.440 --> 33:44.940
a times. He’s not born realised once, but
many a times he’s born realised, and he’s

33:44.940 --> 33:52.740
sort of, he’s in the centre of it you can
say, one of them, you can call him. So when

33:52.740 --> 33:55.810
he talks of his Mooladhara chakra he is sort
of, he has already done the path many a times

33:55.810 --> 33:59.570
and now he’s going to the subtler and subtler
and subtler form. So when he says that the

33:59.570 --> 34:08.119
Mooladhara chakra is opened out then you can
walk on the water it’s correct, because

34:08.119 --> 34:14.779
he is at that subtle stage of ascendence.
One has to ascend once, second time, third

34:14.779 --> 34:19.779
time, forth time, and then you see, you reach
a stage where you start ascending. But even

34:19.779 --> 34:24.980
then it is not so important to walk on the
water what is so important to walk on the

34:24.980 --> 34:30.619
water? It’s nothing so important because
you see it’s easy, you can take a boat and

34:30.619 --> 34:35.919
walk! It’s nothing so important! So walking
on the [water], means also on the right hand

34:35.919 --> 34:42.679
side; it’s a right-hand side [power] to
walk on the water or to fly in the air, all

34:42.679 --> 34:49.839
this is the right-hand side things which also
can be done with the help of a boat, or what

34:49.839 --> 34:55.990
you call an aircraft or even you can use a
bhoot! For that you can use a dead entity

34:55.990 --> 35:03.359
and we can make him take us to any place we
feel like. It can be done! This ESP business

35:03.359 --> 35:07.119
is only that.
So it can be done by other methods also. So

35:07.119 --> 35:12.000
it is nothing important. You see, it’s sometimes
very confusing when we see that some people

35:12.000 --> 35:15.420
can fly in the air! They say [that] in the
subtle form they have gone. You don’t see

35:15.420 --> 35:20.839
the body moving but you see that they they
can feel it. The difference being that the

35:20.839 --> 35:27.130
people who are realised can guide themselves
and can see the body moving but those who

35:27.130 --> 35:31.940
are not realised they find that their subtle-being
being taken out and their consciousness going

35:31.940 --> 35:36.619
with them somewhere else and they’re sitting
on top of the house; from there watching themselves

35:36.619 --> 35:40.150
and they’re sitting there and they see themselves
sitting down like that, you see. These phenomenon

35:40.150 --> 35:50.339
take place. That is absolutely nothing but
a soul being ridden by a dead entity. So there’s

35:50.339 --> 35:53.880
nothing great about it. That is also right-side
stuff.

35:53.880 --> 36:00.910
The left hand side as I told you is the emotional
feeling about things. You feel tremendous

36:00.910 --> 36:08.309
love for others and sometimes you know people…I
would say Sainath was one of them who had

36:08.309 --> 36:14.000
this left hand side gift with him, and he
was love personified. And he was so much full

36:14.000 --> 36:24.509
of love for people that once there was a woman
who was very poor and she couldn’t celebrate

36:24.509 --> 36:28.630
her Diwali day and he couldn’t bear it so
he gave her some water and the water became

36:28.630 --> 36:34.829
like oil and she burnt lights in that; and
it’s a fact, you can do that, it’s possible.

36:34.829 --> 36:42.730
And with this power you can increase food,
you increase the food stuff, like Christ did

36:42.730 --> 36:49.009
it. That’s also [using] one side (left side).
So all these things come in a personality;

36:49.009 --> 36:53.589
some people have one more another has some
more and some people have all these qualities.

36:53.589 --> 36:57.980
Some, those who are incarnations have everything.
They can do everything that they want to.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.220
And they will use whatever they want to do
and if they don’t want use any powers they

37:00.220 --> 37:07.400
will not use. So it depends on…so it’s
nothing important, supposing you see something

37:07.400 --> 37:12.119
alright, there you can see it is a good thing.
But that doesn’t mean that you should stick

37:12.119 --> 37:16.890
on to those things but you must try to do
what you don’t see. For example, now you

37:16.890 --> 37:23.380
see the light coming out of somebody’s head,
now that’s one side of looking at things.

37:23.380 --> 37:31.759
Another is that you can feel the another person.
Don’t you feel the another person? How he

37:31.759 --> 37:40.690
is, how he meets you, how you are coming closer
to that person. Can you feel that compassion

37:40.690 --> 37:46.450
for him that he’s not where you are? That
also is another balancing stuff.

37:46.450 --> 37:50.329
But this should done [only when you are solid].
This is very dangerous for some people who

37:50.329 --> 37:53.690
try to be helpful to others when they are
not themselves solidified properly.

37:53.690 --> 37:58.339
So I would again warn you that when you start
seeing lights and all that try to remember

37:58.339 --> 38:02.470
that you are going on one side, you are seeing
more. Then be more compassionate in you tongues,

38:02.470 --> 38:06.910
in your talking in your behaviour. Try to
have more love. Means right hand side is more

38:06.910 --> 38:12.279
developing, the left is less; is the heart.
So you have to raise your Kundalini from right

38:12.279 --> 38:16.019
and left, but this is all mechanical and it
works out. It’s only thinking about it,

38:16.019 --> 38:20.579
“Oh, I have to develop my heart more,”
the balance has to be there. This also should

38:20.579 --> 38:25.450
develop feeling for others. Now the feeling
for others cannot be explained as I feel for

38:25.450 --> 38:30.440
others. I just, if somebody is crying anywhere
I get tears into my eyes automatically. Even

38:30.440 --> 38:35.089
if you are not crying and if you are feeling
hurt about things I get this hurt feeling

38:35.089 --> 38:41.160
within Myself. Like that, you see, you should
really feel that hurt feeling and that desperate

38:41.160 --> 38:46.190
feeling and that cry. Of course I mean, it
comes to some people too much but they do

38:46.190 --> 38:49.589
not have the other side.
So you should have both the sides and both

38:49.589 --> 38:55.190
the balancing directors within you.
So those who are seeing things more should

38:55.190 --> 39:00.150
not go on bothering about what they are seeing.
“It’s coming that way, alright” because

39:00.150 --> 39:04.950
they have done that kind of tapasya so they
see things. And it helps Sahaja Yoga very

39:04.950 --> 39:08.049
much because you can see for yourself who
is realised who’s not realised, this thing,

39:08.049 --> 39:12.609
that thing.
But still the dryness is in you. So if it

39:12.609 --> 39:19.210
is in you, you should try to develop it. So
whatever you don’t have you try to develop

39:19.210 --> 39:24.940
that. Whatever you have don’t be satisfied
with that. That’s the best way you can rise.

39:24.940 --> 39:30.069
Those people who can see things should try
to feel others. Those who can feel others

39:30.069 --> 39:36.950
should see things and it will work out that
way. So this is what it is.

39:36.950 --> 39:48.450
And in the mahakarana state where the mahakarana
is, that is a very, very subtlest form of

39:48.450 --> 39:57.519
state, where the chakras which have got the
Deities are connected with, are sort of a

39:57.519 --> 40:06.509
reflection of the Deities of the Viraata.
Now these Deities in the Viraata are reflected

40:06.509 --> 40:14.920
in you, are awakened in you and they start
moving and making the whole thing work out

40:14.920 --> 40:21.980
as it should be. Up to the karana state it
is very good. But the mahakarana state is

40:21.980 --> 40:27.109
the stage where it is the real – what you
call the object – object and reflection.

40:27.109 --> 40:33.759
When you can come up to the object which is
a really deep state of mind where you are

40:33.759 --> 40:42.480
with the object and when you are at the object
you are very close to an incarnation state.

40:42.480 --> 40:49.089
So we can say that as far as you people are
concerned you should try to understand up

40:49.089 --> 40:54.660
to karana state, because beyond that how to
jump and how to go is not the question just

40:54.660 --> 40:58.720
now. What’s the use of telling you about
something which is a far fetched stuff? So

40:58.720 --> 41:02.299
we’ll talk about it later. But this is how
it is the fourth stage of chakras.

41:02.299 --> 41:08.279
Now, tentza prashna? Ah, te chakra. Ha. (marathi:
His question? Ah, about chakras. ok.) He says

41:08.279 --> 41:11.509
you see it [moving] anti-clockwise. You do
see [that]. Because most of the people who

41:11.509 --> 41:15.130
have seen it have seen it on other people
and when you see on other people from the

41:15.130 --> 41:19.680
backside, you see it on the anti-clockwise
side. But, if you see it from the front, it

41:19.680 --> 41:22.420
is clockwise, that’s why.
Yogi: No, what I am saying is – you feel

41:22.420 --> 41:30.880
the chakras moving, you are outside your own
body, still the chakras are moving in an anti-clockwise

41:30.880 --> 41:32.039
manner.
Shri Mataji: Yes it depends on, you know,

41:32.039 --> 41:35.529
what I’ve just now told you: that the chakras,
say for example, for an ordinary human being

41:35.529 --> 41:40.960
the chakras are nothing but ordinary plexuses;
for a realised soul it is more than that.

41:40.960 --> 41:47.749
So the more you move into a greater view of
your own awareness that’s how the chakras

41:47.749 --> 41:54.289
start manifesting. Now for example my chakras
are working all over. All over. Do you see

41:54.289 --> 42:01.730
the difference? So it depends on the awareness
of the person. As much as the light now say;

42:01.730 --> 42:11.869
that much it shows the light, you see as much
as the power. So that is what it is.

42:11.869 --> 42:22.710
Now is there are any questions left on chakras?
Yogi: About the number of petals.

42:22.710 --> 42:34.539
Shri Mataji: Yes. Number of petals are also
gross stuff you see. Till you go to a certain

42:34.539 --> 42:41.749
stage where your petals are being created,
because of a, there’s a little mathematics

42:41.749 --> 42:46.499
about it, little mathematics. And all this
mathematics has been worked out in a human

42:46.499 --> 42:59.450
being – how it is. But these are the…we
can say that now for example, in a person

42:59.450 --> 43:13.529
now, a light is there: say 25 watts. Now 25
watts are to be converted to 60 watts or something

43:13.529 --> 43:18.960
like that. So we have to see the dimension
into which the person, means that portion,

43:18.960 --> 43:25.490
is going to grow, you see. It’s a big mathematics
about you. The dimension to which that can

43:25.490 --> 43:33.809
grow and into what sphere it is going to penetrate.
For example, the Mooladhara chakra you can

43:33.809 --> 43:42.220
take for an example now. Mooladhara chakra
is actually fourth that way, because it covers

43:42.220 --> 43:50.609
the four sides of the human personality. It’s
in the abstract calculation, it is the fourth

43:50.609 --> 43:54.220
side of the personality. And the fifth side,
the movement in the fifth dimension, doesn’t

43:54.220 --> 44:02.579
take in the Mooladhara chakra. It takes above
the Mooladhara chakra.

44:02.579 --> 44:06.809
So the fourth dimensions as shown by that.
These are the different dimensions of a man.

44:06.809 --> 44:12.960
At those levels how many dimensions you touch
by these tattoos – it is calculated like

44:12.960 --> 44:21.299
that. In My book I have given notes of these
in very great details as to what are the dimensions

44:21.299 --> 44:25.549
one touches in this state and how far you
go.

44:25.549 --> 44:32.819
But the same Mooladhara becomes only two later
on. But it is such a subtle and sharp two

44:32.819 --> 44:41.619
which penetrates just like this, all over.
So it depends on…you can say in a machine

44:41.619 --> 44:45.759
you have different types of bones and different
types of screws and with different dates.

44:45.759 --> 44:54.460
Now what is the calculation? Is there any
reason you can say why it is so?

44:54.460 --> 44:59.539
So it is a very detailed work and it’s all
worked out because the dimensions into which

44:59.539 --> 45:04.859
a human being will be going, all that is worked
out, and on that chakra only these is dimensions

45:04.859 --> 45:09.999
you achieve. So it has a meaning. But it’s
not only four chakras. It’s not only four.

45:09.999 --> 45:14.220
It has got many petals inside and it’s a
very interesting one. Actually on Mooladhara

45:14.220 --> 45:20.369
I have written a big chapter, complete. How
many folds are inside and how these things

45:20.369 --> 45:25.789
work out and how many folds, what do they
suggest and how far they open out, because

45:25.789 --> 45:30.769
it’s all a dimension which is worked out.
For example, if you take a banyan tree, the

45:30.769 --> 45:37.269
seed is so small. A banyan tree has the smallest
seed. Now why is it so? And why is it so microscopic?

45:37.269 --> 45:43.109
Because it is so dynamic. For you this is
all worked out like a capsule. And it’s

45:43.109 --> 45:48.559
a capsule which is to work this dimension
[and] it has to work that dimension. So it

45:48.559 --> 45:53.039
is rather a calculated stuff – which I have
described. I have only described Mooladhara

45:53.039 --> 45:58.910
really in the full [way] because it makes
such a big volume of one Mooladhara chakra,

45:58.910 --> 46:02.490
that I gave up about others. I have just mentioned
[briefly] about them.

46:02.490 --> 46:06.240
But only Mooladhara itself, when I started
describing, it became such a big, huge thing.

46:06.240 --> 46:11.089
So I gave in I said, “Now better not do
other ones (chakras).” But it’s quite

46:11.089 --> 46:18.630
a complicated stuff and, God has his own stage
or style of planning and we can’t question

46:18.630 --> 46:28.099
Him. He does it according to His own whim.
He has his own style. But [even] His whim

46:28.099 --> 46:33.559
has understanding – everything has.
You will find that sometimes if you try to

46:33.559 --> 46:40.059
study that way. If you ask Me certain things
I try to answer it in a different way. Because

46:40.059 --> 46:44.990
there are His ways of doing things and He
understands and that’s how He does it. But

46:44.990 --> 46:50.430
still I have tried to bring out at least Mooladhara
chakra, so that human beings must understand

46:50.430 --> 46:55.299
that how complicated they are made, how God
has been so careful to place their Mooladhara

46:55.299 --> 46:59.920
so well and how He has put the force there,
how it’s a living machinery, how it’s

46:59.920 --> 47:04.609
working out so that people should understand
the importance of their chakras and importance

47:04.609 --> 47:07.829
of their being, how important you are. You
are not ordinary people.

47:07.829 --> 47:14.069
Even if there’s a say an ordinary tape recorder,
we are so careful about it. How much we should

47:14.069 --> 47:18.640
be careful about our own machinery, which
is being created in ages with such great understanding,

47:18.640 --> 47:23.289
such mechanism! Every chakra if you take up,
even if you take up three yugas, you won’t

47:23.289 --> 47:29.519
understand one chakra. It is such a tremendous
working inside. I have of course given only

47:29.519 --> 47:39.999
the description of it and the reason why is
a stage which will make you really mad! But

47:39.999 --> 47:50.940
I’ve tried to explain in that. You have
read my [description of] Mooladhara did you?

47:50.940 --> 48:03.499
It’s quite an elaborate stuff.
Question: In Delhi, the question was “what

48:03.499 --> 48:26.089
is the purpose of life?”
But that stage I never cancelled it, that

48:26.089 --> 48:36.950
stage is not today. You see when I said it
that just now you have to incarnate again

48:36.950 --> 48:43.900
and again. You are not at that stage. But
when the whole thing…you see, nothing is

48:43.900 --> 48:49.349
wrong in any one of these. When they say,
“There is a day of judgement.” But before

48:49.349 --> 48:55.069
that God is going to give you a chance. He
is going to give you a full chance to improve

48:55.069 --> 49:00.619
yourself [and] go to that position. You see,
like that, we can say that, first the trees

49:00.619 --> 49:04.470
are brought into the by sowing the seeds then
the trees grow up, then there are flowers,

49:04.470 --> 49:08.589
then the flowers are again, they become seeds.
Then again the trees and again this thing,

49:08.589 --> 49:13.269
until again they reach a certain stage, till
they have completely ripened then they remove

49:13.269 --> 49:18.759
the whole thing and the whole thing becomes
the Brahma itself. And whatever is a waste

49:18.759 --> 49:23.819
matter is thrown out.
So ultimately it’s the union. But the “union

49:23.819 --> 49:30.789
of your being” means with God. It’s a
much greater state. First of all it’s the

49:30.789 --> 49:34.650
purification point. You see for your purification
you are to be born again. You have not reached

49:34.650 --> 49:38.980
that stage where you should become mahanirvana,
have you? If you become, might be [that] you

49:38.980 --> 49:43.980
might land up in hell so better not try that!
See, you must understand that just now, at

49:43.980 --> 49:48.960
this stage you have to go further, purifying
yourself till you reach a certain stage where,

49:48.960 --> 49:54.849
when you reach a certain stage, at that time,
God has given you enough chance, enough chance

49:54.849 --> 49:59.799
to improve yourself. [But if] still you are
rakshasas then you are not going to be tried

49:59.799 --> 50:06.640
any more. But it’s quite clear, I must say.
You cannot now allow it to take to chance.

50:06.640 --> 50:17.749
One of the butchery is going to be very close,
is very close; I mean I would say can be anytime.

50:17.749 --> 50:23.809
So you be careful I mean, it’s just there.
So many have to be neutralised because they

50:23.809 --> 50:32.640
are just very troublesome. So it can be quite
close so just be careful about it.

50:32.640 --> 50:37.339
So, you see, if everything fits into everything
else but what happens is every religion, part

50:37.339 --> 50:42.079
of it is said so this cuts out the other.
Supposing I say, “You have to go to this

50:42.079 --> 50:45.410
room,” now if I say that, “You have to
come two steps that side,” and then I say,

50:45.410 --> 50:50.369
“You have to come three steps this side,”
these are all connected stuff but because

50:50.369 --> 50:54.670
it is said only three steps here so you said,
“Then in that religion it is said three

50:54.670 --> 50:58.089
steps inside you and what about those two
steps?” I have to tell about them also.

50:58.089 --> 51:02.339
Because I have to tell about all those two
steps [that] you have to take first, I better

51:02.339 --> 51:06.380
not tell about these three steps because you’ll
put your eyes, oh, very nice. It’s not going

51:06.380 --> 51:11.499
to come in a plate (easily). You have to work
it out consciously. Understand now.

51:11.499 --> 51:24.380
Yogi: Where do the chakras go after death?
Shri Mataji: Chakra is within you, chakras

51:24.380 --> 51:36.319
is a place. They just only exist within you.
Yogi: Within the Earth element?

51:36.319 --> 51:42.450
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. They are in the body
only, they are in the body. The body is itself

51:42.450 --> 51:47.579
like a seed, you see, you become like a seed.
But they are potent. You can’t see them.

51:47.579 --> 51:52.630
Chakra is a state.
Yogi: I think chakra and kundalini must be

51:52.630 --> 51:56.059
together?
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is something like

51:56.059 --> 52:01.549
a light going out and the tube is still there.
It is like that the Kundalini. But it stays

52:01.549 --> 52:05.569
on top of the head of the person. The only
difference is, supposing, the light goes out

52:05.569 --> 52:13.119
and stays near by. You see the potential is
there in the light. It is like that. The place

52:13.119 --> 52:25.859
for the light to pass is there.
Question: (inaudible)

52:25.859 --> 52:48.650
Shri Mataji: No, no. They’re already separated
in the gross they are separated; inside also

52:48.650 --> 52:55.579
they’re separated but there’s a void because
yes, that is the only point. You see, the

52:55.579 --> 53:02.089
Kundalini gets enlightened or sort of she
gets a little enlightened you can say when

53:02.089 --> 53:05.599
it faces me and it immediately starts rising.
Or when you people [also], because you are

53:05.599 --> 53:10.099
also Sahaja Yogis. It doesn’t happen with
anybody else you will be amazed you know.

53:10.099 --> 53:32.980
So now what is the other question?
Question: How do the chakras move in the body;

53:32.980 --> 53:36.499
is it horizontally?
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. That is true, they

53:36.499 --> 53:40.259
are moving horizontally. They are moving horizontal
but when you move them like this, you see;

53:40.259 --> 53:46.109
like you have seen the wheel…
Question: Why not you go this way?

53:46.109 --> 53:50.150
Shri Mataji: No it doesn’t work out. It
works out better this way. Because these are

53:50.150 --> 53:54.380
the things that are emitting, you see. If
you do it like this it goes down. This way

53:54.380 --> 53:58.819
these are moving you can move this. You have
seen that in a watch there are some like this

53:58.819 --> 54:00.239
parallel and some are like this.
Ata dusra kai prashna ahe? (marathi: now what

54:00.239 --> 54:10.230
other question is there?)
Yogini: Mataji, the fake gurus have damaged

54:10.230 --> 54:30.029
the chakras. How do they do it? And what’s
to be done about it?

54:30.029 --> 54:39.329
Shri Mataji: You see, what gurus do is they
use different chakras for introducing into

54:39.329 --> 54:46.029
the sympathetic nervous system some entities
which they have controlled. They do not control

54:46.029 --> 54:52.599
many entities as such, but what happens, for
example now I would say, during war many people

54:52.599 --> 55:02.259
died just like that; killed and this and that.
In those countries, those souls, they never

55:02.259 --> 55:09.400
had a [normal] human life and they were treated
just like animals and they were very much

55:09.400 --> 55:14.400
tortured. So they had that feeling in their
minds that, “We should also torture these

55:14.400 --> 55:20.670
people.” So when they die they do not die
really and they do not get into the pretloka

55:20.670 --> 55:24.249
(प्रेत लोक Spirit world).
They stay in the atmosphere and that’s why

55:24.249 --> 55:28.269
wars are very bad things, because wars create
such human beings much more, with accidents

55:28.269 --> 55:33.319
and people who are very depraved in life,
very dissatisfied who are doing all kinds

55:33.319 --> 55:38.940
of depraved actions and secretive things and
all kinds of horrid things. All such people,

55:38.940 --> 55:44.819
all of them, when they die they do not really
go to pretaloka because they don’t think

55:44.819 --> 55:54.970
of their salvation but they are just thinking
of their lust, greed or we can say possessions,

55:54.970 --> 56:01.239
those who are grabbing things, thieves and
all sorts of people. We can call ‘evil’

56:01.239 --> 56:05.710
people and satanic people, when they die they
find they become much more subtler and they

56:05.710 --> 56:11.109
can be better off if they act in a subtle
body. So they use the subtle body for acting

56:11.109 --> 56:15.729
into people and such people are easily available.
So these gurus, what they do, that they themselves

56:15.729 --> 56:21.239
are evil geniuses, and they have a way of
capturing those people and they use them.

56:21.239 --> 56:25.059
And they introduce to you through your different
chakras. For example, Ravana had a capacity

56:25.059 --> 56:30.829
to speak and in his speech he used to introduce
rakshasas into the human beings in Ceylon.

56:30.829 --> 56:35.849
Otherwise imagine in Lanka, people should
never fight Rama, because at that time the

56:35.849 --> 56:40.210
sensitivity of people was so great that they
knew that Rama was an incarnation. They were

56:40.210 --> 56:44.729
not gross as today they are, that one has
to tell that, “Oh, here I am the incarnation.”

56:44.729 --> 56:50.229
That time it was not Kali Yuga so they knew
he was an incarnation. And so many of them,

56:50.229 --> 56:54.519
I mean some of them did not, but quite a lot
of them knew and despite that nobody could

56:54.519 --> 57:01.680
oppose it because their mind was captured
by these entities put [into them] by Ravana

57:01.680 --> 57:03.569
and they fought Him.
So, it was so, even at the time of Krishna:

57:03.569 --> 57:08.710
people knew who He was at least they had quite
an idea, even Kauravas new about it.

57:08.710 --> 57:15.279
But this Kali Yuga is a wretched thing – nobody
see anything clearly. But those times were

57:15.279 --> 57:19.539
not like that. People knew who was an incarnation
and they understood it.

57:19.539 --> 57:24.799
At that time also, these people had to use
some sort of a way of putting them off and

57:24.799 --> 57:29.569
they used this method of enticement.
And when they used this method of enticement,

57:29.569 --> 57:34.170
in that use, they learned also subtler ways
and subtler ways which they are using in Kali

57:34.170 --> 57:39.479
Yuga very well. They are actually rakshasas
and they know these methods – how to entice

57:39.479 --> 57:45.799
people. There are so many ways of doing it.
And when you bend your head before them that

57:45.799 --> 57:50.349
is the best time when they can put it into
your ego and they can finish you off for once

57:50.349 --> 57:53.259
for all. So that’s how they do it. And you
are no more yourself!

57:53.259 --> 57:58.940
First of all they act on your heart: you become
a nervous person your hands start shaking

57:58.940 --> 58:03.759
your feet start shaking; they act on your
heart chakra. You use the power of raksha

58:03.759 --> 58:10.799
(रक्षा – protection) which is
the basic point of the heart chakra. And then,

58:10.799 --> 58:16.970
once you start losing the grip over your nerves
you find that [it’s] as if somebody is doing

58:16.970 --> 58:20.839
for you. And if you take somebody’s name
you start jumping and you don’t know anything

58:20.839 --> 58:25.269
– it’s an experience, you see. There are
so many things they do like that: thousand

58:25.269 --> 58:29.880
and one [things].
But human beings, as a whole in the Kali Yuga,

58:29.880 --> 58:38.930
instead of improving has gone down absolutely
in his conception of Divinity and in everything.

58:38.930 --> 58:47.900
I mean he’s a hopeless case otherwise! But
by God’s grace Sahaja Yoga may save him.

58:47.900 --> 58:51.200
They way it is I mean he’s very, very blunt.
He cannot seek, he’s very insensitive. And

58:51.200 --> 58:58.319
he carries on all kinds of his malpractices
thinking that he’s a rare saint ever born.

58:58.319 --> 59:04.440
You see that’s another great quality of
Kali Yuga! This is the problem. They have

59:04.440 --> 59:11.729
no conscience left now to tell them that this
is wrong or that is wrong they’ve killed

59:11.729 --> 59:23.999
it. Everywhere it is so.
Tumhi shalid shi mulad ka? (marathi: your

59:23.999 --> 59:29.599
kids are in school?)
Yogi: Ho. (yes)

59:29.599 --> 59:39.650
Shri Mataji: Achcha (ok). Ata dusra prashna
(marathi: now another question)

59:39.650 --> 59:50.700
Yogi: How music works on the five chakras?
Shri Mataji: You see all these five elements

59:50.700 --> 59:58.970
are very important in our body and they are
the body of the chakras also as I have told

59:58.970 --> 01:00:06.239
you. So what happens that, when you sing the
music, the vibrations can go through the musical

01:00:06.239 --> 01:00:12.569
sound and can excite certain chakras. You
see for example for the hriday (heart) chakra

01:00:12.569 --> 01:00:18.960
is very good or also for the Vishuddhi chakra
it is very good. Not for all the chakras.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.839
But certain chakras it does. But supposing
you say a mantra that’s the sound, with

01:00:24.839 --> 01:00:31.069
beautiful music and a realised soul then it
is very effective. For example, Ganesha you

01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:38.229
can excite him with a beautiful sloka if you
are a realised soul and if your Ganesha is

01:00:38.229 --> 01:00:43.759
correct, you can excite the Ganesha of another
person very easily, I mean such a person do

01:00:43.759 --> 01:00:47.109
it.
So music, sound, all these things have an

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:52.989
effect and we are now using that method very
extensively. But supposing now, we go in a

01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:57.369
mass meditation and many people are there
and some chakra is caught, say Vishuddhi is

01:00:57.369 --> 01:01:01.529
caught, I can correct their Vishuddhi by just
putting My finger on this, like this, because

01:01:01.529 --> 01:01:09.700
this has the sound, this is in the chakras,
there is a micro-sound which is carrying the

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:14.289
vibrations. Actually the part of the vibrations
is the micro-sound also, micro-light, micro-sound

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:18.279
and you can say all the five elements are
micro there. So when I put my finger the micro

01:01:18.279 --> 01:01:25.239
sound can carry the rest of them and the person
can be corrected. We can do it. Specially

01:01:25.239 --> 01:01:29.099
Vishuddhi. Very easy to correct Vishuddhi
on that. You can correct most of the things

01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:33.079
but certain things are very easily corrected.
Vishuddhi, which is responsible for the sound,

01:01:33.079 --> 01:01:41.380
made from the sound element.
As we have seen that water element is very

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:50.410
good for treating people for the lower chakras,
up to the heart chakra, because the water

01:01:50.410 --> 01:02:01.269
and salt can help you for the Nabhi chakra
because salt is the earth element and it is

01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:07.910
essence of the ocean and the essence of the
ocean is in the bhavasagara. So we can use

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:12.799
salt water for clearing the lower chakras.
We can use light for the eyes because, this

01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:21.519
is made out of the prakash – light element.
Like that different things can be done. And

01:02:21.519 --> 01:02:28.349
with these different elements if you use them,
you can make all the dirt or all the obstructions,

01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:36.940
which are collected, in your particular chakra
by putting them back into the same element

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:40.390
and cleansing them out so the element takes
it away.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:45.079
For Mother Earth also, She has so many elements
in Her that She can take away so many of your

01:02:45.079 --> 01:02:53.819
problems which are troubling you, in your
being, because of some imbalance of the Mother

01:02:53.819 --> 01:03:01.519
Earth element. You see, this is all due to
the imbalance of these elements in you, accumulated

01:03:01.519 --> 01:03:10.329
more beyond than what you want it. That’s
why I said, “the extreme of it.”

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:19.019
Prithvi tattwa (earth element) is expressed
through Shri Ganesh and Shri Ganesh is the

01:03:19.019 --> 01:03:31.819
form of the purified principle of the Earth
element and is the same. I mean, in a flute

01:03:31.819 --> 01:03:40.559
you have two notes, the first and the last
are the same. In the same way in a human being

01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:47.349
the seven notes, the first one is a Ganesha
and the last one is also a Ganesha. So these

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:59.039
seven notes are the same. And these seven
notes make the Earth element and not completely

01:03:59.039 --> 01:04:04.519
Earth element but started with earth element
purified. When it loses its Earth element

01:04:04.519 --> 01:04:10.670
problems completely it is Parabrahma, I mean
it becomes all Brahma. Because Earth element

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:19.660
is, outside is the Earth element but inside
is dhara, is dhara, is dharana – is the

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:28.759
power to sustain, is the power to sustain.
And that power is the purest form of Earth

01:04:28.759 --> 01:04:34.460
principle (tattwa). So, that you become later
on; gradually the whole Earth element drops

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:45.569
down and you become that.
So it is the dharana shakti as they call it:

01:04:45.569 --> 01:04:47.660
the power of sustenance. Is the Ganesha. So,
like that, in every chakra you have a very

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:56.369
subtle and subtle-most point. And that subtle-most
point is the note that the Divine is playing

01:04:56.369 --> 01:05:02.579
at that point, because every note has a different
frequency, a different intonation, a different

01:05:02.579 --> 01:05:13.079
sound, which helps in the melody of this Universe.
So, like that, we have seven chakras and the

01:05:13.079 --> 01:05:18.859
seven notes. And they are different notes
but these notes then create permutations and

01:05:18.859 --> 01:05:26.150
combinations and that is how a chakra gets
into a swara (musical note) and then it becomes

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:32.039
a sound, and from a sound it becomes a word,
and from word it becomes a language and like

01:05:32.039 --> 01:05:39.529
that it goes on and the same subtle form starts
becoming something else. For example if I

01:05:39.529 --> 01:05:45.589
have love for my children: how [do] I express
it? I make a house for them, I make a place

01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:51.839
to live for them, I cook food for them, I
make a bed for them. It’s a gross expression

01:05:51.839 --> 01:05:57.859
of that subtle love I have. In the same way
whatever is subtle within us is expressed

01:05:57.859 --> 01:06:04.239
outside with the help of the elements that
are outside, to express the subtle through

01:06:04.239 --> 01:06:10.089
our gross behaviour or gross material things
also we do.

01:06:10.089 --> 01:06:17.569
So, it’s the same subtle, which is expressing
outside. But then we become so gross later

01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:22.660
on that we forget the inner part of it. A
Mother may create something, all these things

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:26.119
and then she becomes so possessive of her
children, she’ll think, “I’ve done so

01:06:26.119 --> 01:06:30.589
much for my children,” that she wouldn’t
even think why she has made it! She forgets

01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:35.180
the love part of it and she becomes nothing
but the gross thing. She just starts scolding

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:40.200
the children, even for a small thing here
and there. You see she does this for love,

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.900
and then she forgets it. That’s what is
an extreme behaviour. Extreme behaviour means,

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:46.950
from the subtle, you get to the gross and
the gross, and the grosser. Once you become

01:06:46.950 --> 01:07:00.160
grosser you are dead.
Ata kai prashna? (Marathi: Now what question?)

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:08.279
Yogi: (asks question about badhas)
Shri Mataji: Those who can see badhas are

01:07:08.279 --> 01:07:14.869
on the emotional side. They can see the badhas.
There also you can see two types of people.

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:20.269
Those who already themselves in badha, they
can see badhas, very clearly; they can see

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:24.369
the dead persons. Those who are already badha
can see that another person who has got a

01:07:24.369 --> 01:07:29.170
badha because they are in the collective subconscious
themselves, so they can see. And a person

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:37.819
the one who, supposing, who is a drunkard
– he can see. A person who is drunk can

01:07:37.819 --> 01:07:43.999
see a badha in another person because he is
a subconscious type, he likes it.

01:07:43.999 --> 01:07:50.039
But some people can achieve a state in an
emotional way that they can see badha clearly.

01:07:50.039 --> 01:07:55.479
If they are realised souls, the emotional
state, people say, the bhakti people can see

01:07:55.479 --> 01:08:03.219
badha there. But even the supra-conscious
people can see a light coming before them,

01:08:03.219 --> 01:08:06.829
they can see somebody standing before them
like a light and then say that, “There’s

01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:16.359
a light coming.” They might get fragrance
or things like that can happen. They are called

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:25.270
as tanmatras is the causal principle of all
the Universe, causal – tanmatras. Means

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:38.250
for Earth the causal principle is fragrance.
So, supposing somebody has done a lot of search

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:51.600
in the field of say, earth element, so such
a person can get a lot of fragrance; they

01:08:51.600 --> 01:09:05.550
can. It is a variety everywhere created because
of their different searches and because of

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:11.380
their different seeking.
You see badha, just say somebody has a badha

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:18.040
or not. If he has Agya and a heart it’s
definitely a badha. And you just ask the person

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:28.350
to put their hands before the photograph and
he starts shaking. Normally he shakes.

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:40.980
You see I don’t know how you should make
it out but it’s really easy you can make

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:45.330
out the, cannot put their eyes towards my
photograph. If you ask them to close their

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:52.480
eyes their eyes will start flickering, hands
will start shaking, eyes will always flicker.

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:58.590
slightest ?? will show on the eyelids like
this. You see badha, can be of many types.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:02.750
Some people just have for the time being,
some people have permanent residence. Some

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:24.070
have bags full! So you just can’t say what
it will be.

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:36.510
You just don’t worry about these things.
You see the thing is people think that there’s

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:42.310
only one type of badha, emotional badha. There
can be both types, a person who is very egotistical

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:46.960
also is dominated by somebody else. Abnormal
area, abnormal behaviour, who is not a normal

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:56.890
person, can come from anywhere.
There is no difference between sunlight and

01:10:56.890 --> 01:11:11.430
sun, moonlight and moon. So there is no difference
at all. It is only the human beings who think

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:30.230
there are two stuffs. Which is an advaita
(non-duality), which one and the same thing.

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:45.470
For example, now this bangle is beautifying
my hand, so what is the difference between

01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:58.350
this bangle and the beautification? Is the
quality of a person. Is the quality. It’s

01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:20.370
like the ?? and ??. You will take out the
rest of it and you will say that this is all

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:25.560
useless. It’s not that. You see, in every
thing this is all there, it’s one. What

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:36.400
is the essence of sunlight and sun? Sun has
no meaning without sunlight. Sunlight has

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:57.960
no meaning without sun. It is not essence,
it is everything but. We can say water and

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.040
a ice. There is no difference at all. Human
beings cannot conceive it, that’s the trouble

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:10.230
with the human mind, because it is an advaita,
so human beings cannot see it. They think

01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:20.550
of two (manifold) things always. You see through
perception it is not possible for you to perceive

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:24.810
it, but you can understand by analysing. Many
things human beings can’t understand. You

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:31.890
just cannot, because you have a limited brain,
you have a limited awareness, you have limited

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:32.380
love.
