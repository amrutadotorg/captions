00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,480
Shri Mahakali Puja, "Ascent". San Diego (USA), 19 June 1989.

3
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,360
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

4
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:41,890
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in totality

5
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,810
is a reflection of Adi Shakti in totality;

6
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,130
or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,

7
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,370
She's managing all these three powers.

8
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,930
But Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali

9
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:06,130
in the sense that it is the desire of God Almighty.

10
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:14,130
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all the three powers

11
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:23,770
and that's why we can say that when She is in a potential stage

12
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:31,730
She is Mahakali and then She divides Herself into two other forces

13
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,890
as Mahasaraswati

14
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:44,650
and the ascending force that we call,

15
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,050
or as a parasympathetic nervous system

16
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,090
expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi force.

17
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,050
So She has actually all these forces in Herself,

18
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,850
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,

19
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,490
She desires to act and when She wants to act

20
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,810
Her potential force becomes these two other forces.

21
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,370
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must understand

22
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,770
that inbuilt within this force within us is desire;

23
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,010
so we can desire anything, if we want we can desire everything,

24
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:38,130
we can desire say the joy, we can desire the knowledge,

25
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,410
we can desire to be compassionate and love and we can desire also

26
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,890
the destruction of those which are negative forces.

27
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,890
But the Mahakali force is the one

28
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,370
which is working out the constructive force

29
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,570
but in that constructive force only there has to be destruction,

30
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,010
because if you are constructing something and there is destruction

31
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,210
which is trying to destroy your construction then you have to

32
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,130
destroy that destructive personality;

33
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,010
and this is what people sometimes misunderstand

34
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,650
and they think that Mahakali force is negative force

35
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,730
or is a force of destruction, it is, but in a very positive way

36
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,210
and if you understand this part of Mahakali force

37
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,050
then you will understand that if you have desires

38
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,490
to construct yourself properly in Sahaja Yoga

39
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,770
then you should also have the desire to destroy

40
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,290
whatever is standing against your construction.

41
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,170
So one by one we should see within ourselves what sort of things

42
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:03,010
that drag us down and thus they do not give us this desire.

43
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:09,570
If this desire becomes intense then you start immediately

44
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,010
seeing what are the forces that are destroying your ascent.

45
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,410
So we have to ascend is the point, our goal is to ascend,

46
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,050
our destination is to ascend; so our desire should be

47
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,690
that we should ascend and construct our being in such a manner

48
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,130
that we can receive all the...

49
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,690
so we should understand that we have to be prepared

50
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,290
to destroy many things within us,

51
00:11:51,530 --> 00:12:00,210
if we have to become great evolved personalities

52
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,850
As you have seen in evolution itself you had huge big animals

53
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,410
like mammoth this that and they they could not cope with the evolution

54
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,530
so they were all destroyed, so many thing were destroyed,

55
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,090
and this destruction is built in within us,

56
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,450
when we ascend we just start seeing that these are the forces

57
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:34,050
which are destroying us and that our destruction is so much

58
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,370
that if we do not desire the destruction of these destructive forces

59
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,410
we'll be finished.

60
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,050
So at the same time, when we are ascending higher we have to know

61
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,850
what we have to destroy. For example even in living forces

62
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,370
when a flower becomes a fruit,

63
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:05,890
lots of things which were the part of the flower get destroyed,

64
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,650
automatically, but that is done in the will of God

65
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,970
by His own understanding. So it's absolutely perfect.

66
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,850
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something, we must know

67
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:30,570
what we desire, first fix your goal and then relate it to that.

68
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,330
Now there are many deviations in life, like you are going

69
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,130
to the airport, our attention should be we have to reach the airport

70
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,330
and whatever are distractions are distractions;

71
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,970
we should not get lost with it,

72
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,610
if you get lost with those distractions,

73
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,850
then we cannot achieve our goal in time.

74
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,970
So one has to understand first of all that our goal is to ascend

75
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:04,650
and for that the distractions are on our way, because of ourselves,

76
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,290
because of ignorance, because of darkness,

77
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,050
because the light is not so much.

78
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,810
The first destroying factor that is within us

79
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,530
is the Shri Ganesha's power

80
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,690
and this Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

81
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:30,570
She first planted Shri Ganesha to emit holiness on this Earth,

82
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,130
so the whole thing could be vibrated

83
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:39,210
and as you know one aspect of Shri Ganesha is also Omkara,

84
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,450
means this vibratory awareness which flows everywhere.

85
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,250
So these vibrations have four sides in it:

86
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:58,530
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

87
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:04,090
auspiciousness through Mahakali power;

88
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:13,530
then these same vibrations also comfort us through Mahakali power.

89
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,210
Vibrations do not give you desires as such, if you see,

90
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,250
they do not give you desires,

91
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:29,210
but they give you proof of your desires being fulfilled.

92
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,330
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this is your desire

93
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,570
and you give vibrations to that person; so it's a means,

94
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:49,330
so it is also the action part which is there in those vibrations,

95
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,290
but this action also comes from desire.

96
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,690
If you don't have desire you won't act,

97
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:05,570
so the desire is so important even to establish your own path,

98
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,490
to establish your forward march, if your desire is poor,

99
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,090
if you're half hearted you can't work it out.

100
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,210
Half hearted people cannot achieve anything in Sahaja Yoga,

101
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,490
it's not meant for half hearted people, it's meant for people

102
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:30,290
who are brave, who have intense desire,

103
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,570
who are intelligent and who are auspicious.

104
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:46,970
But in case you do not have intense desire,

105
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,890
then the pure desire doesn't work

106
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:55,650
and you do not get your realisation; also after getting realisation

107
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,010
unless and until you have desire to ascend,

108
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,290
very strong intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

109
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,650
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to first of all

110
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,810
early in the morning, while taking the name of Ganesha,

111
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,410
must say what is my desire, this is my goal,

112
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,370
this is what it is, all activity must be surrendered for this work.

113
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:30,970
So now how our desires are curbed, first of all

114
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,410
through conditionings. We have certain conditionings.

115
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,850
After Sahaja Yoga people become very affectionate,

116
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,810
so immediately even if in the west - where the family is

117
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,050
not so important, children are not so important,
selfishness is there,

118
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:57,330
people think about themselves only, they cannot think of others -

119
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,730
even in those countries, it starts developing a kind of a,

120
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,570
another cocoon of myness, my child, my house, my home, my family;

121
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,610
then the attention starts working on that,

122
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,850
you become half hearted towards your ascent, because you're ascending

123
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:33,170
in a way so called and also you are spreading out.

124
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:43,850
Then the concern goes to other conditionings we have.

125
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,050
Like the other day I met one fellow he said that "Mother,

126
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,250
I'm a Sahaja Yogi, I know but I can't get over the idea of Christ",

127
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,610
I said "Who has asked you to get over idea of Christ?

128
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,690
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,

129
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,450
but understand it in its own comprehensive way

130
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,050
and see for yourself!".

131
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,810
But this conditioning is of thoughts. Supposing if you have read

132
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,370
too many books, if you have gone through...

133
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,170
supposing you are a born Hindu or a born Christian

134
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,610
or born Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

135
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,290
You were born as a human being, you got this stamp later on

136
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,090
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

137
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,330
These stamps you did not carry when you were born.

138
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,690
Supposing the child was lost, he could be any religion,

139
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,930
so these are not really your innate religions,

140
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,850
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian or anything.

141
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,650
Then you have another conditioning, that you belong to this nation,

142
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:59,090
that nation, like we have, we have America, this, that, that,

143
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,450
but still these are stamps. You were born in America,

144
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,010
that's why you are an American, anybody who is born in America

145
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,690
is not different from anybody else.

146
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,410
Only thing according to the climate of a particular place,

147
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,530
you might have your complexion, your height, your face and all that,

148
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,170
but that doesn't mean that innately this is meant for America,

149
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,330
it could be anywhere.

150
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,690
Then all these conditionings within us start acting on our language,

151
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,210
on our styles, on our lives in every way.

152
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,850
Then we start becoming Americans,

153
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,770
so these are the effects of the outside that come in us

154
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,290
and then we say we the Americans,

155
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:51,650
but if you scratch them inside body's the same, heart is the same,

156
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,290
the blood is the same, everything is the same,

157
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,410
there's nothing different, it's even not skin deep.

158
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,090
But in the brain it has gone that "I am an American".

159
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,050
Then all these things that are in that society,

160
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,170
for example in America so many things are allowed so that's alright,

161
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,530
in India many things are allowed, that's alright,

162
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,210
like that we start accepting the society, the norms of the society

163
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,450
and the conditioning starts.

164
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:37,930
But with all that, this desire is there, the pure desire to ascend.

165
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,250
I think you put these lights little ahead because they are so,

166
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,250
paper there and with my force, light is going behind,

167
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,930
no, no, not that one please, because they are facing that fan,

168
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:08,330
could bring them down here, still quite close to that fan you know,

169
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,650
you can put them anywhere, you can put them here if you want,

170
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,210
you see because my, the air is blowing that way and they are all going that way.

171
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,930
So the desire within us to ascend comes to us

172
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,610
also as a reaction to all these things,

173
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,650
when we see as Americans what's happening to our country,

174
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,650
what's happening to the people, what's happening to our surroundings

175
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,890
and then we get a shock. Oh God! What is this?

176
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,490
Then we also see this is artificiality, like in England

177
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,090
you have to wear a tail coat, you have to wear this,

178
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,610
you have to have this kind of spoon, this kind of a glass, this that

179
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,690
so reaction builds in; so you start anti-culture,

180
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,570
anti-culture to get rid of artificiality.

181
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,970
Well the desire behind it is, is to seek the reality.

182
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,650
To seek reality then they have hair just like primitive people,

183
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,890
they live like primitive people and the reaction is built in

184
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,930
behind all that is the same desire, is to ascend.

185
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,170
So this Mahalakshmi power is acting within us,

186
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:52,610
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can say, alright you want to have,

187
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,890
say variety of things, go ahead with it, then you go crazy you see

188
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,410
what is this going on, why should we be so mad about it.

189
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:18,290
Now they want to have, a, you want to have say, your children,

190
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,770
your home, your houses; then you just get fed up with it, because

191
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,050
children become arrogant, they become horrid, they trouble you,

192
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,450
then you say, "Oh God! I'll never have any children any more!"

193
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,650
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible and husbands horrible,

194
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,090
then you divorce, you go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing

195
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,210
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't work out,

196
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,130
nothing seems to work out, you feel so frustrated

197
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,130
and that action and reaction works on your desires.

198
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,930
So your desires go on changing,

199
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,690
especially when we are wanting to be affluent,

200
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:11,290
people become affluent and then they find the problems of affluence,

201
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,810
so a reaction is built in,

202
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,050
those who witness those problems of the rich,

203
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,490
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

204
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,570
So in every way the desire to achieve things works out,

205
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,970
like some people want to have power, they go into politics,

206
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,570
fight it, get it done and done forever.

207
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,090
So lives after lives it goes on.

208
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,730
Then you are born in modern times when I am here

209
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:54,570
and now your only strong desire is to become The Spirit - I hope it is.

210
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,370
So now all these back things are to be crossed over,

211
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:09,250
they are finished, now what should we do for our realisation,

212
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,450
what action we should take?

213
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:18,650
The first action is to develop your Mahakali power,

214
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,450
by one power you destroy all that is nonsensical,

215
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:32,130
destroy all that is impeding you, troubling you, blocking you,

216
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,450
destroy all that, just I don't want it.

217
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,690
Because I have seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off,

218
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,690
like you have to go to the airport, suddenly you find

219
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:52,490
they have fallen into one of the gutters. "What happened?"

220
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:57,410
"Mother, we felt like going there", but why?

221
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,770
So keep your attention on that point.

222
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,370
Some people get married, in Sahaja Yoga also,

223
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,850
they have a desire to marry, have children, this thing,

224
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,810
but in that also they get fixed up. Marriage is not the end,

225
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,410
it's just one of the means to be balanced.

226
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:29,170
So we have to have desire that we have to achieve something

227
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,610
so go on destroying all that is within us, within us is there are

228
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:43,210
six enemies as they say, is anger, then greed, jealousies, violence,

229
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,250
all these are within us, so have to destroy these six enemies.

230
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,610
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that she destroys

231
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,890
all the enemies that stand in your way,

232
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,730
all the rakshasas, all the devils all the negative forces,

233
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,770
she tries to destroy, so that your [path] should be all right;

234
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,650
but while She is destroying all of them

235
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,450
if you are sticking on to them, what can She do?

236
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,530
So your desire should be pure and that you should say that all right:

237
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,850
"We want to achieve that", and she is working it out for you.

238
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,610
This is the first thing, Her job.

239
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,490
Then the second job is that She comforts,

240
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,570
She gives you comforts, of every kind.

241
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,090
The first comfort She gives you is of your body,

242
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:42,250
your body becomes comfortable, means all your diseases and

243
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:48,170
all your troubles are destroyed. You find that your body becomes

244
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,530
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy

245
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,930
and you can work out your realisation.

246
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,890
This is the first thing She does for you: is to give you comfort.

247
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,770
Then she also gives you comfort of the Spirit,

248
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:12,890
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

249
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:18,050
you can live anywhere, you can live in a jungle, you are comfortable;

250
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,450
if you live in the most busiest place you are comfortable,

251
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,690
so you are comfortable everywhere and that sort of a comfort

252
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,370
she can establish within you.

253
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:40,810
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She gives you the joy,

254
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:50,170
joy of every kind, joy that emits from everything, from everyone.

255
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,650
So that is the highest you get when you keep your desire,

256
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,770
the flame of your desire burning, till you reach that state

257
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:10,370
of spiritual attainment, then you find that no more desire is left;

258
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:16,770
but only one, if it is any, that "let the whole world be realised".

259
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,810
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy his drinking with others,

260
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,450
like that you become, you are drunk in your joy and

261
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,730
why not others enjoy, so you work for it.

262
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,690
But human beings, I have seen, they move like a yo-yo,

263
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,770
they achieve their spiritual attainment they have the joy

264
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:43,370
and then they go back to help people, they get caught up with them,

265
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,970
they are not strong enough; because the Mahakali power is not strong.

266
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,290
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

267
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:01,650
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced

268
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,290
and in that imbalance you lose your will.

269
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,690
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara must be fixed properly.

270
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,290
There are so many ways by which you can fix up your Mooladhara

271
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,650
and you must fix up your Mooladhara first;

272
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:26,570
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite moves in the sky,

273
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,850
stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into any direction

274
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,170
to any height, wherever you go you are quite in charge,

275
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,290
you know how you are moving.

276
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,050
It can bind your attention, everything. So what we say that

277
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:50,450
the roots are very important first to be established

278
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,610
for the growth of your desire upward, like a tree.

279
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,890
So they go hand in hand, Mahakali power and Ganesha's power

280
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,010
go hand in hand because that's the foundation;

281
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,210
if it is based on that foundation, desires grow much stronger

282
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:16,930
and stronger and effective and they do not deviate.

283
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:24,610
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you reach that state where

284
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,570
there's no other desire left but to enjoy, you just enjoy,

285
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,290
without any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

286
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,770
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be enjoyed.

287
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,770
What is there to talk about it? What is there to say about it?

288
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,690
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment

289
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:59,570
and that should happen everywhere and that's what you are worshipping.

290
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,250
So now I hope you have hundred and eight names of Mahakali,

291
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,570
and if you have the hundred and eight names of Mahakali

292
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:13,610
you will see one by one that her these stages are working out for you,

293
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:19,330
how manifest that you can see in those names.

294
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,850
So now first we'll have a one Atarva Sheersha

295
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,870
and then we can have these hundred and eight names.

296
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,890
