[Music]

00:22.160 --> 00:29.250
the system started long time back in

00:25.020 --> 00:34.290
India I think he was at the time of

00:29.250 --> 00:38.790
Patanjali maybe even earlier for giving

00:34.290 --> 00:46.380
realization for talking about higher

00:38.790 --> 00:52.800
life they all had to go to very grateful

00:46.380 --> 00:55.340
Isis and it was absolutely the freedom

00:52.800 --> 01:01.829
of the Guru whom to accept who lockers

00:55.340 --> 01:05.060
and everybody was tested thoroughly by

01:01.829 --> 01:10.430
the Guru if they are capable of

01:05.060 --> 01:17.820
achieving self-realization on and this

01:10.430 --> 01:23.220
test was so hard so difficult and also

01:17.820 --> 01:26.100
to a point of cruelty that very few

01:23.220 --> 01:27.690
could pass through that test it's not

01:26.100 --> 01:33.319
like sahaja yoga everybody is a sahaja

01:27.690 --> 01:38.690
yogi it's not like that that of course

01:33.319 --> 01:43.800
made it a very narrow margin for people

01:38.690 --> 01:46.649
to achieve their realization and these

01:43.800 --> 01:50.369
Guru never used to leave their own seats

01:46.649 --> 01:52.350
they call it the Kea they would be there

01:50.369 --> 01:54.810
in their own place all those who would

01:52.350 --> 01:57.750
like to go to him could come you may

01:54.810 --> 01:59.580
call for miles together nothing no

01:57.750 --> 02:01.789
obligations of the Guru that he should

01:59.580 --> 02:01.789
meet

02:05.520 --> 02:16.270
perhaps they didn't feel that love and

02:10.210 --> 02:20.110
compassion for the seekers they int

02:16.270 --> 02:23.110
understand that basic us are ardently

02:20.110 --> 02:27.100
seeking the truth and they should not

02:23.110 --> 02:31.180
suffer so to get this group odda to

02:27.100 --> 02:34.450
position of a guru after that they had

02:31.180 --> 02:43.450
to work very very hard to achieve a

02:34.450 --> 02:48.489
state of a saint but in sahaja yoga that

02:43.450 --> 02:51.209
is not the case as you know I just

02:48.489 --> 02:53.620
thought if people get their realization

02:51.209 --> 02:56.380
they'll see for themselves what's wrong

02:53.620 --> 02:59.080
with them they will introspect

02:56.380 --> 03:05.459
themselves and will try to correct

02:59.080 --> 03:05.459
themselves I am supposed to be your guru

03:06.810 --> 03:20.940
but I feel sometimes that the idea of a

03:14.440 --> 03:20.940
guru is very different from mine

03:22.280 --> 03:34.920
normally a guru is a very very strict

03:26.099 --> 03:41.190
person and has no patience of Vega but

03:34.920 --> 03:46.970
as you all have got realization and you

03:41.190 --> 03:54.380
are your own gurus I don't put that

03:46.970 --> 04:00.540
condition on I leave it to your feet I

03:54.380 --> 04:07.170
tell you or Leslie in all the way

04:00.540 --> 04:11.870
possible what I think good for but I

04:07.170 --> 04:11.870
don't compel

04:15.000 --> 04:22.500
like these gurus used to do I mean they

04:17.220 --> 04:29.940
used to beat they used to hang them on

04:22.500 --> 04:31.710
the well they were so very strict with

04:29.940 --> 04:37.890
their disciples and I had an experience

04:31.710 --> 04:40.880
of this they never used to spike no

04:37.890 --> 04:40.880
question of laughing

04:42.279 --> 04:52.709
and would never show any kind of

04:45.809 --> 04:55.389
weakness of kindness for the decides

04:52.709 --> 05:05.139
this is about the spiritual gurus I'm

04:55.389 --> 05:07.889
telling the way they used to treat the

05:05.139 --> 05:07.889
disciples

05:08.580 --> 05:16.280
was rather difficult for me I can't

05:19.320 --> 05:29.930
all the time the compassion becomes the

05:25.170 --> 05:35.990
tears in my eyes I find it impossible I

05:29.930 --> 05:40.560
may just say it in a way sometimes also

05:35.990 --> 05:44.580
say it in a way that looks like that is

05:40.560 --> 05:48.470
scolding but to be a mother and to be a

05:44.580 --> 05:48.470
guru is the most difficulty

05:52.380 --> 06:00.780
I do not know what comes first but of

05:56.460 --> 06:06.600
course every mother wants her child to

06:00.780 --> 06:11.880
be good and the Holy Mother wants her

06:06.600 --> 06:17.960
child to be a holy person the first

06:11.880 --> 06:17.960
thing is the holiness now for that

06:18.050 --> 06:22.430
how can you compel someone

06:25.010 --> 06:41.600
only thing that makes you understand is

06:32.090 --> 06:47.840
this that if you don't become Modi how

06:41.600 --> 06:53.990
will you get your asset we have to be

06:47.840 --> 07:00.430
holy what discipline one can put for

06:53.990 --> 07:04.600
making a personhood what can you force

07:00.430 --> 07:04.600
what can you get angry for

07:08.139 --> 07:13.169
only method I use normally is to forgive

07:14.490 --> 07:19.419
maybe

07:15.819 --> 07:25.810
the forgiveness is the highest quality I

07:19.419 --> 07:34.919
think for teaching people sahaja Yoga is

07:25.810 --> 07:39.659
very different from all other gurus that

07:34.919 --> 07:39.659
we believe in the power of love

07:43.800 --> 07:50.599
power of love teaches you how to be

07:48.030 --> 07:50.599
forgiving

07:51.630 --> 08:06.420
it makes you know boo it makes you very

08:01.020 --> 08:08.520
balanced now at this stage when we are

08:06.420 --> 08:12.180
about to become gurus or we are already

08:08.520 --> 08:17.250
gurus should be nothing but embodiment

08:12.180 --> 08:21.510
of love it's a very different cerium

08:17.250 --> 08:25.350
testing no guru will accept this those

08:21.510 --> 08:27.060
who are already already accepted as

08:25.350 --> 08:31.200
gurus all over all the knowledge that

08:27.060 --> 08:36.330
you've got in sahaja yoga has been

08:31.200 --> 08:39.780
already told by those gurus long time

08:36.330 --> 08:45.600
back somebody has told you somebody has

08:39.780 --> 08:50.790
told that somebody has told that but all

08:45.600 --> 08:54.600
the knowledge the total knowledge about

08:50.790 --> 08:59.970
your being your chakras everything which

08:54.600 --> 09:06.300
you know now is with you that is the

08:59.970 --> 09:10.160
truth you have the complete subtle

09:06.300 --> 09:10.160
knowledge which nobody had before

09:10.550 --> 09:18.450
because maybe these gurus did not want

09:14.820 --> 09:24.330
to give or maybe these gurus did not

09:18.450 --> 09:30.990
know themselves all the knowledge of

09:24.330 --> 09:36.740
sahaja Yoga is simple very subtle and is

09:30.990 --> 09:42.600
real now after having this within you

09:36.740 --> 09:48.120
should not be just mental it should be

09:42.600 --> 09:54.300
spiritual and to make it spiritual what

09:48.120 --> 09:57.120
happened to do is to now when you love

09:54.300 --> 09:59.250
others you start working on them but the

09:57.120 --> 10:01.870
end of the whole thing I must tell you

09:59.250 --> 10:05.550
that when you are a guru

10:01.870 --> 10:08.560
also a mother you have to express

10:05.550 --> 10:10.390
yourself like a mother she's kind she's

10:08.560 --> 10:12.850
gentle she forgives

10:10.390 --> 10:15.550
she also corrects whenever necessary but

10:12.850 --> 10:17.380
in her own sweet me she corrects so the

10:15.550 --> 10:21.370
correction takes place is not that a

10:17.380 --> 10:24.700
rebellion darkness so all that wisdom of

10:21.370 --> 10:27.910
a mother is within you is already there

10:24.700 --> 10:30.730
so please try to use I am sure it will

10:27.910 --> 10:33.340
all work out and as it is we are a very

10:30.730 --> 10:38.140
beautiful group of people who are

10:33.340 --> 10:46.740
something out of the blue who are so

10:38.140 --> 10:46.740
much in peace and enjoy - that may God

10:52.200 --> 11:16.559
you

10:53.740 --> 11:16.559
[Music]

11:16.670 --> 11:18.730
you
