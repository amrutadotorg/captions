00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:21.609
[Music]

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.250
the system started long time back in

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:34.290
India I think he was at the time of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.790
Patanjali maybe even earlier for giving

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:46.380
realization for talking about higher

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:52.800
life they all had to go to very grateful

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:55.340
Isis and it was absolutely the freedom

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.829
of the Guru whom to accept who lockers

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:05.060
and everybody was tested thoroughly by

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.430
the Guru if they are capable of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:17.820
achieving self-realization on and this

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:23.220
test was so hard so difficult and also

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.100
to a point of cruelty that very few

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.690
could pass through that test it's not

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.319
like sahaja yoga everybody is a sahaja

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:38.690
yogi it's not like that that of course

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:43.800
made it a very narrow margin for people

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:46.649
to achieve their realization and these

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.369
Guru never used to leave their own seats

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.350
they call it the Kea they would be there

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.810
in their own place all those who would

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.750
like to go to him could come you may

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.580
call for miles together nothing no

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.789
obligations of the Guru that he should

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.789
meet

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:16.270
perhaps they didn't feel that love and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:20.110
compassion for the seekers they int

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.110
understand that basic us are ardently

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.100
seeking the truth and they should not

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.180
suffer so to get this group odda to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.450
position of a guru after that they had

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:43.450
to work very very hard to achieve a

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:48.489
state of a saint but in sahaja yoga that

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.209
is not the case as you know I just

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.620
thought if people get their realization

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.380
they'll see for themselves what's wrong

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.080
with them they will introspect

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:05.459
themselves and will try to correct

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.459
themselves I am supposed to be your guru

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:20.940
but I feel sometimes that the idea of a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.940
guru is very different from mine

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:34.920
normally a guru is a very very strict

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:41.190
person and has no patience of Vega but

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:46.970
as you all have got realization and you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:54.380
are your own gurus I don't put that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:04:00.540
condition on I leave it to your feet I

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:07.170
tell you or Leslie in all the way

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:11.870
possible what I think good for but I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.870
don't compel

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.500
like these gurus used to do I mean they

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:29.940
used to beat they used to hang them on

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:31.710
the well they were so very strict with

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.890
their disciples and I had an experience

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.880
of this they never used to spike no

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.880
question of laughing

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:52.709
and would never show any kind of

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:55.389
weakness of kindness for the decides

00:04:52.709 --> 00:05:05.139
this is about the spiritual gurus I'm

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:07.889
telling the way they used to treat the

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.889
disciples

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.280
was rather difficult for me I can't

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:29.930
all the time the compassion becomes the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:35.990
tears in my eyes I find it impossible I

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:40.560
may just say it in a way sometimes also

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:44.580
say it in a way that looks like that is

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.470
scolding but to be a mother and to be a

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.470
guru is the most difficulty

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:00.780
I do not know what comes first but of

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:06.600
course every mother wants her child to

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:11.880
be good and the Holy Mother wants her

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:17.960
child to be a holy person the first

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.960
thing is the holiness now for that

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.430
how can you compel someone

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:41.600
only thing that makes you understand is

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:47.840
this that if you don't become Modi how

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:53.990
will you get your asset we have to be

00:06:47.840 --> 00:07:00.430
holy what discipline one can put for

00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:04.600
making a personhood what can you force

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.600
what can you get angry for

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:13.169
only method I use normally is to forgive

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.419
maybe

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:25.810
the forgiveness is the highest quality I

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:34.919
think for teaching people sahaja Yoga is

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:39.659
very different from all other gurus that

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:39.659
we believe in the power of love

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:50.599
power of love teaches you how to be

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.599
forgiving

00:07:51.630 --> 00:08:06.420
it makes you know boo it makes you very

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:08.520
balanced now at this stage when we are

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:12.180
about to become gurus or we are already

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:17.250
gurus should be nothing but embodiment

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:21.510
of love it's a very different cerium

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:25.350
testing no guru will accept this those

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:27.060
who are already already accepted as

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:31.200
gurus all over all the knowledge that

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:36.330
you've got in sahaja yoga has been

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.780
already told by those gurus long time

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:45.600
back somebody has told you somebody has

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:50.790
told that somebody has told that but all

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:54.600
the knowledge the total knowledge about

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:59.970
your being your chakras everything which

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:06.300
you know now is with you that is the

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:10.160
truth you have the complete subtle

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.160
knowledge which nobody had before

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:18.450
because maybe these gurus did not want

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:24.330
to give or maybe these gurus did not

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:30.990
know themselves all the knowledge of

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:36.740
sahaja Yoga is simple very subtle and is

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:42.600
real now after having this within you

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:48.120
should not be just mental it should be

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:54.300
spiritual and to make it spiritual what

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:57.120
happened to do is to now when you love

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.250
others you start working on them but the

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.870
end of the whole thing I must tell you

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:05.550
that when you are a guru

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:08.560
also a mother you have to express

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.390
yourself like a mother she's kind she's

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.850
gentle she forgives

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:15.550
she also corrects whenever necessary but

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.380
in her own sweet me she corrects so the

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:21.370
correction takes place is not that a

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.700
rebellion darkness so all that wisdom of

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:27.910
a mother is within you is already there

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:30.730
so please try to use I am sure it will

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:33.340
all work out and as it is we are a very

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:38.140
beautiful group of people who are

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:46.740
something out of the blue who are so

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:46.740
much in peace and enjoy - that may God

00:10:52.200 --> 00:11:16.559
you

00:10:53.740 --> 00:11:16.559
[Music]

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.730
you
