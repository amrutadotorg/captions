00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.334
Last night was a night of complete darkness,

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:31.000
that they call it as amavasya;

00:00:31.634 --> 00:00:39.200
and just now only the first phase of the moon has started.

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:49.234
Today we are here to celebrate

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:54.033
the day when the Sahastrara was opened out.

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:57.701
Also you have seen in the photograph.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:03.167
It was actually a photograph of my brain,

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:07.767
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened out.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.667
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.334
It’s something great these modern times have done.

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:21.667
So the modern times have brought a lot of things

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.367
which can prove the existence of the Divine.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:35.000
Also it can prove about me.

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:38.501
It can convince you what I am.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:45.334
This is very important because, in the modern times,

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:52.033
this advent has to be recognised, has to be fully recognised.

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:58.801
This is one of the conditions for all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.501
Now let’s see what’s happening  in the modern times, in the

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:06.434
brains of the people.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.601
In the brains of the people today, if you see,

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:17.334
there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.434
There has been an attack since long

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:25.167
but in the modern times it’s the worst time

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:37.100
that they are trying to make the limbic area very insensitive.

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:49.400
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:56.734
and very depressive music,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.667
you can say, like Greek tragedy nonsense.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.167
All these things came from the medieval period

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:15.467
till, we should say, this new age has started.

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:23.167
That one itself was no good for our limbic area.

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:27.033
That made us very depressive.

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:38.033
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called miseries.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.167
But then came this modern age

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:52.667
in which people became overactive -

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:56.167
over-activity started.

00:03:56.367 --> 00:04:02.234
With that the brain also became overactive.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.734
In addition to the dullness before,

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:11.000
it’s gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:17.434
So to dull it again they took to drugs,

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:23.367
they took to very horrible music.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.133
That’s how they made this limbic area very, very insensitive.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:38.734
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin with

00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:44.167
was to be taken in greater quantity and

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:49.033
later on they had to take the drugs

00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:53.701
which were of a much more severe nature.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.367
It went on like that and now we know that

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:04.133
this drug is the only way people think they can survive. Why?

00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:08.267
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

00:05:08.434 --> 00:05:12.133
In the modern times we have something called ‘tensions’.

00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:16.801
It was never there before. People never talked of their tensions.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.133
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!” “You give me a tension!”

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:27.667
What is this tension? It’s because of my advent.

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:35.567
The limbic area wants to know about me.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.300
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is increasing,

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:46.033
is trying to rise in people;

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:48.634
because you become the channels.

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:55.000
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations,

00:05:55.467 --> 00:06:03.501
and these vibrations give a challenge to the Kundalini,

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:09.267
or a message, and in various people it rises.

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:11.801
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara,

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:15.667
or it may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls back,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.200
because there’s no recognition.

00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:21.634
So every time they do something

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.033
this Kundalini comes up and gives them a pressure,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.267
because their Sahastrara is not open.

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:35.534
It’s a closed door. Because of the closed door

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:39.100
this gives them a kind of a pressure in the head,

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:44.100
which they don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

00:06:44.434 --> 00:06:47.133
Actually the Kundalini is trying

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.734
to push it out, itself, but it cannot.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.234
And those also who get their Realisation,

00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:01.200
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

00:07:01.634 --> 00:07:05.167
they go on getting into tensions.

00:07:06.534 --> 00:07:13.267
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out so many years back,

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:20.634
still we have some things to be done -

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:25.400
is to clear out our Sahastrara, first of all.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.033
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:35.601
then once it opened out,

00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:40.033
the brahmarandhra opened out,

00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:46.000
then we started feeling the grace,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.601
and it moved onto our

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:58.734
Ida and Pingala – the grace not the Kundalini.

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:03.734
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.200
soothed down our left and right sides

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:11.133
by which our chakras opened more,

00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:17.400
and more threads of the Kundalini started piercing through.

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:23.734
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s important that you must meditate.

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:29.501
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras will be alright

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.234
because, as you know, that the peethas,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.567
or the controlling centers of all these chakras,

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:42.367
are in the brain around the limbic area.

00:08:42.734 --> 00:08:46.801
So if your Sahastrara is clear

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.267
everything works out in a very different way.

00:08:52.734 --> 00:08:55.367
How to keep the Sahastrara alright,

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:59.300
is the big problem always people ask me.

00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:02.634
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:10.734
I've incarnated on the lotus of one thousand petals.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:15.200
That’s why I could break it also.

00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:20.367
As I am today, as you see me. Of course

00:09:20.534 --> 00:09:23.601
they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:29.801
So this is the illusion which is all the time there for you,

00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:33.734
which is very elusive.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.133
It had to be that way because

00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:40.634
you could not have faced me otherwise

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.234
with all the lights coming out of me

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:50.067
or the way you saw yesterday Sahastrara – some sort of

00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:57.234
abstract colours thrown on all sides and the lights thrown outside.

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:01.000
Please don’t take photographs when I’m speaking, alright?

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.100
You can take later on. There’s no hurry about.

00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:05.567
Just pay attention to My lecture.

00:10:05.734 --> 00:10:09.667
Please, pay attention. It’s important.

00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:13.100
It is to be, this, told beforehand,

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:16.234
that nobody should take photographs during puja

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.801
because it is a very intense thing [that] one has to work it out.

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:26.133
Please, pay attention. Even if you don’t understand,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.634
it has effect on you.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:36.267
So I would request you to pay full attention to me when I am talking.

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:42.033
It works better.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.133
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after by you.

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:52.234
It’s the temple of your Mother.

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:55.234
When you say you put me in the heart,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.300
actually you put me in the Sahastrara.

00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:02.167
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here

00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:07.000
is the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha, the centre,

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:12.100
which controls the heart, which is the

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.300
seat of the Sadashiva or you can say of Shiva.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.667
So when you put me in the heart actually you put me there.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.300
So to raise it from heart to there,

00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:32.701
or to bring it from there to the heart,

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:38.133
is the problem of two types of people.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.634
Some people who are sensitive in their heart

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.734
– I would say in Europe we can say

00:11:50.067 --> 00:11:52.200
Italians are very sensitive on their heart –

00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:54.534
the first thing they do as soon as they see me

00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:57.601
they put their hands to their heart.

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:07.567
And that is what it is, that, if you try to feel me in your heart,

00:12:07.734 --> 00:12:11.200
to begin with, it’s much easier.

00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:16.367
To feel me in your heart.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.767
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

00:12:27.367 --> 00:12:32.200
You have to love me as I love you.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.267
You have to love each one of yourselves,

00:12:38.534 --> 00:12:42.067
because you are all within me.

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:47.501
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.701
Love is within.

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:59.267
And love manifests if, just, you open your heart.

00:12:59.734 --> 00:13:05.567
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:09.767
Firstly, the conditioning.

00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:16.534
In the West to express your love is regarded as sinful actually.

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:19.300
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:22.267
but “I hate you!” even a child could go on saying,

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:25.367
“I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!”

00:13:26.067 --> 00:13:32.400
But to hate someone is sinful. To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:40.067
So to say that, “I hate you! I hate you!” is a sinful act.

00:13:41.767 --> 00:13:49.734
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on saying, “I love you."

00:13:53.467 --> 00:14:01.434
After all, you must love a person who is so dear to you.

00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:10.667
Anyone who has done something good for you, you love that person.

00:14:12.234 --> 00:14:17.801
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you the rebirth,

00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:23.300
it should be the easiest thing to love.

00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:31.000
And if She says that, “They are all within my body",

00:14:31.801 --> 00:14:36.133
so it should be even easier to love each other.

00:14:36.634 --> 00:14:44.634
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is done through this love,

00:14:45.267 --> 00:14:52.367
this love which is not conditioned,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.167
which is not inhibited,

00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:07.133
which doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want any return – nirvaaj.

00:15:07.601 --> 00:15:12.133
But the conditionings are too much.

00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:17.167
First the problem of conditioning comes to you

00:15:17.567 --> 00:15:25.000
when you think that, “This condition makes me hate someone,”

00:15:25.601 --> 00:15:31.701
or, “I cannot love someone because this is the condition!”

00:15:33.067 --> 00:15:36.133
But actually

00:15:36.534 --> 00:15:44.067
the conditioning itself is so absurd, if you see it one by one.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:49.434
To make it simple, I would like you to understand

00:15:49.601 --> 00:15:54.033
the conditioning part where

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:57.033
I read once an article, an interesting one,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.100
“Who killed the romance?”

00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:04.234
So he said “the hairdressers”.

00:16:04.434 --> 00:16:09.267
I was wondering how is he connecting romance with the hairdressers?

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:13.133
Because people used to go to a hairdresser

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.667
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.300
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:27.300
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore another

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:32.167
type of hairdressing, because everyday new things are coming,

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:36.501
then immediately the husband would say

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:41.267
“Oh I hate you because of your hairdressing!”

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:47.234
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s why he loves.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.100
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you hate it!

00:16:50.267 --> 00:16:52.334
“I don’t like it!”

00:16:52.767 --> 00:16:58.167
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I like it”, itself, is a sign

00:16:58.534 --> 00:17:03.067
that the conditioning is too much.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.100
You make a proper hair dress and you dress up properly

00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:14.534
and you come out and then suddenly people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:20.567
Who are you? What right we have got to say that to anyone?

00:17:21.567 --> 00:17:27.200
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:36.167
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say “I hate it”?

00:17:37.334 --> 00:17:39.501
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright,

00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:43.634
I like this but you could do better."

00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:48.534
That’s the sign of love where you want a person

00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:52.267
to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:00.100
But this is on a very, very baser level we see people.

00:18:00.734 --> 00:18:06.400
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent he is,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.100
how smart he is, how charismatic he is,

00:18:12.267 --> 00:18:17.267
how charming – that’s another word which is very elusive.

00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:23.601
These are also kind of conditionings of the mind -

00:18:23.767 --> 00:18:27.767
that you think that a particular style of a person

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:36.567
is a loveable person, that you love that person.

00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:40.133
It’s so much outside.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.467
Or some people actually do not love

00:18:42.734 --> 00:18:45.267
but show they love because somebody has more money.

00:18:45.434 --> 00:18:48.501
And the money, he’s not going to part with, no doubt,

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:52.567
but you love that person because he has more money,

00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:57.601
or he has a better car or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:10.367
So this kind of an idea one has also is a killer of love.

00:19:11.267 --> 00:19:16.267
If love is killed, joy is lost, you cannot have joy without love.

00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:21.601
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

00:19:24.601 --> 00:19:30.000
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:19:30.234 --> 00:19:37.234
Then we start, say, loving our own children, that’s very common.

00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:40.667
I mean, of course, also some people don’t even love their children,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.033
I mean there are all kinds, you see.

00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:51.067
But then they go on, “This is my child, this is my child, this is my child!”

00:19:57.801 --> 00:20:02.267
That again is the death of love.

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:07.267
As I told you before: the sap of the tree rises, goes to every fruit,

00:20:07.434 --> 00:20:11.200
goes to every leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

00:20:11.434 --> 00:20:16.701
It’s not attached. If you are attached to one part or to one flower

00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:19.567
because it is more beautiful

00:20:19.734 --> 00:20:26.434
then the tree will die and the flower will also die.

00:20:27.067 --> 00:20:31.701
So that’s the death of the love.

00:20:32.234 --> 00:20:39.567
So you have to have love which doesn’t get entangled or attached.

00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:44.067
Every time I tell like this they say, “How to do it?”

00:20:45.634 --> 00:20:48.801
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:56.000
Love of conditioned mind is different.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:58.801
A conditioned mind can love

00:20:59.167 --> 00:21:03.267
in a limited way because it is conditioned.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:10.200
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within us,

00:21:11.734 --> 00:21:15.767
which is like a balloon on top of our head.

00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:21.133
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:30.601
The conditioning of course, like they for example, they see a carpet.

00:21:31.567 --> 00:21:35.534
Now it is, according to their conditioning, is not good.

00:21:36.267 --> 00:21:39.634
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!” Or something.

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:46.100
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:50.167
And the higher level at the most, is that you love your own country,

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.434
so “My country is the best!”

00:21:52.634 --> 00:21:56.067
Whether it is killing people,

00:21:56.234 --> 00:21:59.501
whether it is destroying the world peace, it’s all right

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:02.133
because “I belong to a particular country which is the best!”

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.300
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:11.200
It goes on subtler and subtler.

00:22:11.367 --> 00:22:15.267
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:19.434
Because intelligently if you have understood that something is good

00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:22.367
then nobody can save you!

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.200
Because through your brain you have understood.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.033
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading the book

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.267
written by Rabindranath Tagore

00:22:37.767 --> 00:22:41.100
and an Englishman had given a very beautiful

00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:48.133
preface to that, an introduction, and he said that

00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:52.734
the creativity is killed in the West.

00:22:54.167 --> 00:23:00.133
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian critic.

00:23:00.534 --> 00:23:03.434
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:06.133
You don’t have people who are critics?”

00:23:06.334 --> 00:23:12.634
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So what do they criticise?”

00:23:12.801 --> 00:23:19.067
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time there was no rain

00:23:19.234 --> 00:23:23.300
so we had problems and things." He said: “No, no, no, no!

00:23:23.567 --> 00:23:28.100
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise the poet,

00:23:28.267 --> 00:23:31.567
do they criticise an artist?”

00:23:32.267 --> 00:23:35.067
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:40.634
“It is created, whatever he felt

00:23:41.033 --> 00:23:43.701
is created. But supposing he has put something

00:23:44.033 --> 00:23:47.567
very vulgar then of course we don’t like it.

00:23:48.033 --> 00:23:53.067
But if it is created by a beautiful mind, it has to be beautiful."

00:23:53.234 --> 00:23:55.167
“Then you don’t criticise?”

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:58.334
He says, “No, because we cannot create like that.

00:23:58.534 --> 00:24:01.601
So what business have you got to criticise?”

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.400
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we have done:

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:15.167
we have norms about everything, about art, about every creation.

00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:17.567
We don’t like this carpet. Why?

00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:22.167
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual

00:24:22.334 --> 00:24:25.167
understanding of the norms we have reached

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:29.634
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we don’t like it.

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:34.033
Can you even create one inch of that?

00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:43.100
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

00:24:43.267 --> 00:24:47.000
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta. Un-authorised.

00:24:47.167 --> 00:24:51.434
You have no authority to criticise.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.100
You can’t do anything,

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.033
so why should you criticise? Better appreciate and see for yourself

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.334
that you are not in authority, you are not worthy of it, to criticise.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.067
If you are not worthy of it why should you criticise anything?

00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:21.667
And, otherwise also, you must know you are a slave of your ego.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.033
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:31.167
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to a point, to have some norm.

00:25:31.367 --> 00:25:35.634
And then it becomes a collective ego of a particular community,

00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:41.334
of a particular country, of a particular ideology.

00:25:42.133 --> 00:25:49.067
It’s collective. So then they say, “Oh we think this is no art!”

00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:58.234
That is the reason we cannot have masters any more in art.

00:25:59.067 --> 00:26:02.100
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.267
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered a lot.

00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:10.567
You know Gauguin suffered a lot. All these artists suffered a lot.

00:26:10.734 --> 00:26:13.033
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.367
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,

00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:19.801
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:22.334
So I think people have given up.

00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:26.000
I met an artist who had done lots of art work

00:26:26.267 --> 00:26:27.534
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:29.634
He said, “No I don’t want to show you. It’s created for myself."

00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:32.200
I said, “I would like to see!”

00:26:32.567 --> 00:26:37.634
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I said, “Why don’t you show?”

00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:40.067
He said, “No use. People will just criticise.

00:26:40.234 --> 00:26:41.767
I do it for my own pleasure.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.400
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:57.133
So one of the basic things we should avoid is to criticise others.

00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:00.634
Better to criticise yourself.

00:27:00.801 --> 00:27:05.534
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers and sisters,

00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:08.767
criticise your country, criticise all the habits you have

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.701
and laugh at yourself, is the best way.

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:19.100
If you know how to laugh at yourself, then

00:27:19.601 --> 00:27:23.334
you will not object or will not stand in the way

00:27:23.601 --> 00:27:27.300
of any creativity of another person.

00:27:29.434 --> 00:27:33.801
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

00:27:34.601 --> 00:27:38.567
You can criticise anything. You think you have a right.

00:27:38.734 --> 00:27:41.467
Who has given you this right to criticise?

00:27:41.634 --> 00:27:44.801
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

00:27:46.234 --> 00:27:49.801
How can we criticise anyone?

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:59.000
As saints, as you are now, of course, you can make out

00:27:59.234 --> 00:28:03.267
who is caught up, who has given bad vibrations,

00:28:03.434 --> 00:28:06.567
who has the problem. You know that.

00:28:08.033 --> 00:28:11.801
You know it. It’s not conditioning.

00:28:12.367 --> 00:28:15.133
It’s not just you are doing because there’s some ego,

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.801
but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

00:28:17.133 --> 00:28:20.400
It’s an actual feeling within you.

00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:24.167
It’s the bodha (knowledge), by which you know.

00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:27.601
Then what should you do?

00:28:28.133 --> 00:28:31.000
In your love, you have to tell the person,

00:28:31.234 --> 00:28:35.133
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you. Better be corrected!”

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.434
But in a way that he does it.

00:28:37.601 --> 00:28:39.534
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way

00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:41.801
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:44.567
you have not loved that person at all.

00:28:46.334 --> 00:28:51.334
Allow everybody to grow.

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:58.000
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga

00:28:58.167 --> 00:29:01.167
who are very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

00:29:01.334 --> 00:29:06.300
But also there are some people whom we can call as very difficult; very!

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.133
There’s sort of a crack in their head or something,

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.467
that part is missing sometimes.

00:29:13.634 --> 00:29:19.000
Some screws are loose I think. Sometimes they behave like clowns.

00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:22.467
And we have known some people. We just can’t help them.

00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:26.634
They could be very intelligent otherwise,

00:29:26.801 --> 00:29:29.400
they could be very sharp otherwise,

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:34.400
but in Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down

00:29:35.734 --> 00:29:43.267
to that level where you can say: now the growth is possible.

00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:47.434
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like the Sun,

00:29:47.601 --> 00:29:49.634
there would have been no growth.

00:29:49.801 --> 00:29:55.167
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would have been no growth.

00:29:55.334 --> 00:29:59.801
It had to come to the centre where it had both the things

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.367
in proper proportions to grow.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:10.601
In the same way, a human being has to work out

00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:14.067
that you keep a moderation and a balance,

00:30:14.234 --> 00:30:20.133
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.467
That balance you learn when you love someone.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.601
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.601
we have to ask some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:36.767 --> 00:30:39.634
This is out of love for them,

00:30:40.067 --> 00:30:43.801
because once they go out, they improve, I have seen,

00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:46.767
tremendously improve.

00:30:51.601 --> 00:30:57.667
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community

00:30:58.033 --> 00:30:59.801
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

00:31:00.133 --> 00:31:02.501
more nuisance because their ego plays the part,

00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:04.200
maybe the conditioning plays the part,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.801
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:11.267
So we have to ask them that, “Please now, depart for a while."

00:31:11.634 --> 00:31:15.534
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person

00:31:15.767 --> 00:31:18.467
then he has to be straightforward.

00:31:18.667 --> 00:31:25.067
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.234
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that person

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.567
that this is the reason why we want you to be out.

00:31:36.467 --> 00:31:41.434
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome, I know that.

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:45.767
But you have to show complete patience

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.334
and complete understanding

00:31:49.534 --> 00:31:54.000
and you must talk like a person who loves.

00:31:56.367 --> 00:32:03.434
Love has such a power that nobody wants to do something

00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:06.767
that will suggest that they don’t love;

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.334
very powerful thing it is.

00:32:09.501 --> 00:32:12.767
It binds people in such a beautiful manner

00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:15.367
that one wants to do something: for example

00:32:15.634 --> 00:32:18.601
you want to give me flowers, because you know I love flowers.

00:32:18.767 --> 00:32:22.267
So you want to give me flower to suggest that, “Mother we love you”,

00:32:22.467 --> 00:32:24.400
Just to suggest. I know you love me

00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:30.167
but you just want to, sort of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.534
So you want to give me a flower to show your love

00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:38.801
and expression of your inner feeling for me.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.767
So all these material things can be used to express your love.

00:32:46.234 --> 00:32:51.667
They can be very easily expressed in such a manner

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.534
that another person knows what is love.

00:32:55.067 --> 00:33:00.133
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

00:33:02.767 --> 00:33:10.067
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;

00:33:11.467 --> 00:33:17.200
brain has to love. After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:17.367 --> 00:33:20.367
through your brain and intelligence,

00:33:21.334 --> 00:33:25.601
if you reach a point where you understand that: No

00:33:26.033 --> 00:33:29.634
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing all these things.

00:33:29.801 --> 00:33:32.634
It’s just love. It’s simple love.

00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:36.734
So the same Sahastrara which has been used before,

00:33:37.067 --> 00:33:40.534
this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

00:33:40.734 --> 00:33:43.434
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things,

00:33:43.601 --> 00:33:46.400
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

00:33:46.634 --> 00:33:53.067
And there is the culmination where the brain just loves.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.367
That is the situation one has to reach. It just loves.

00:33:57.701 --> 00:34:01.200
It knows only love because it has seen the power of love.

00:34:01.367 --> 00:34:07.167
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and then you see the point.

00:34:07.367 --> 00:34:11.367
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like Vivekachudamani,

00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:15.367
this, that, and all those treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No, nothing!”

00:34:15.634 --> 00:34:19.601
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:27.000
So once you reach that point,

00:34:27.234 --> 00:34:30.534
we can say now you are in nirvikalpa because there is no vikalpa,

00:34:30.734 --> 00:34:33.067
there is no doubt in your head;

00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:36.801
because you love. In love you don’t doubt, no question.

00:34:37.133 --> 00:34:38.734
Only when you think you doubt.

00:34:39.067 --> 00:34:42.267
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just love, because

00:34:42.434 --> 00:34:48.734
you enjoy love. And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.501
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been opened out.

00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:58.033
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:

00:34:58.567 --> 00:35:01.000
through our meditative processes,

00:35:01.367 --> 00:35:04.267
through understanding ourselves and others.

00:35:04.567 --> 00:35:08.434
Maybe logically reaching that point:

00:35:08.634 --> 00:35:12.601
there’s no way out now. We have reached to the end of it now.

00:35:12.767 --> 00:35:14.300
The whole logic has ended up now.

00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:17.801
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:20.734
Once you jump into the ocean of love

00:35:21.067 --> 00:35:26.067
there’s nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every wave of it,

00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:32.467
every hue of it, every touch of it.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.100
That is what one has to learn

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:46.634
by reasoning that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.434
May God bless you all.
