00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:21.194
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

00:03:21.395 --> 00:03:28.812
that the last work of the Divine,

00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:33.888
of opening the last centre

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:44.034
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

00:04:00.932 --> 00:04:11.728
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:32.807
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:51.504
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

00:04:51.705 --> 00:04:56.960
how things are worked in the heavens.

00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:14.847
It is your fortune and God’s love

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:20.462
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:34.954
Without this happening, there could not
have been

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:45.261
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:57.959
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.757
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:25.811
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

00:06:32.773 --> 00:06:41.669
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:54.047
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:15.307
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:25.915
and, with the permutations and combinations

00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:36.741
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.155
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:57.053
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:13.163
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

00:08:17.347 --> 00:08:21.663
and the whole thing came on this Earth

00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:29.555
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:43.529
with such a tremendous force,

00:08:46.222 --> 00:08:53.275
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

00:08:59.007 --> 00:09:05.485
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:16.416
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:43.621
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:10:01.944
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

00:10:07.112 --> 00:10:13.180
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:20.277
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:25.559
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:41.509
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:56.269
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.996
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

00:11:10.806 --> 00:11:18.204
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:27.872
on their golden seats,

00:11:30.327 --> 00:11:38.624
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:46.450
like a big dome,

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:53.098
and opened it,

00:11:53.728 --> 00:11:57.730
and then this torrential rain

00:12:00.414 --> 00:12:04.262
completely drenched me

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:15.703
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

00:12:23.664 --> 00:12:31.376
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

00:12:31.577 --> 00:12:36.579
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

00:12:51.071 --> 00:13:00.131
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:13.278
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.637
and I became absolutely silent.

00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:38.123
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.233
But I saw all stones.

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:07.282
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:18.880
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:24.813
appearing like inflated flames.

00:14:30.504 --> 00:14:38.527
It is a thing which is seen by many people

00:14:43.028 --> 00:14:50.397
but to see it pour that torrential rain

00:14:54.701 --> 00:15:00.412
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:10.016
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

00:15:12.534 --> 00:15:20.347
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

00:15:26.848 --> 00:15:31.693
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

00:15:35.354 --> 00:15:41.154
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

00:15:46.426 --> 00:15:52.165
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:58.984
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:02.701
you cannot see its beauty;

00:16:08.012 --> 00:16:12.236
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

00:16:12.437 --> 00:16:18.589
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

00:16:24.407 --> 00:16:34.040
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

00:16:34.241 --> 00:16:41.665
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.676
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

00:16:55.877 --> 00:17:03.022
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

00:17:19.634 --> 00:17:28.842
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

00:17:36.635 --> 00:17:48.085
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

00:17:55.324 --> 00:18:03.516
and you are drawn out to people

00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:12.443
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

00:18:18.873 --> 00:18:28.410
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

00:18:37.379 --> 00:18:43.202
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

00:18:49.077 --> 00:19:00.708
And even if you desire to ope
the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

00:19:06.782 --> 00:19:15.021
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:20.049
has to be through human beings.

00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:33.940
The power could be with you,

00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:39.706
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

00:19:45.222 --> 00:19:53.644
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:01.221
How to get them?

00:20:03.532 --> 00:20:06.791
How to work it out?

00:20:09.832 --> 00:20:13.909
So I started looking out for people,

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:23.483
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:31.609
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:40.159
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:46.976
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

00:20:50.176 --> 00:20:58.882
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

00:21:04.249 --> 00:21:08.881
And her brain would be covered with clouds

00:21:11.002 --> 00:21:14.347
and darkness.

00:21:15.239 --> 00:21:20.821
Again and again I had to enlighten it

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.893
but she did not get her Realisation.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:35.783
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:44.055
This capacity I had from childhood.

00:21:45.524 --> 00:21:50.712
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

00:21:54.554 --> 00:21:59.338
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:09.189
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

00:22:10.945 --> 00:22:13.807
because I was not living in the forest,

00:22:14.008 --> 00:22:22.663
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.336
and they were not that earnest, that
aartha,

00:22:37.894 --> 00:22:42.988
and I had to do this work among them.

00:22:49.386 --> 00:22:52.387
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

00:22:52.588 --> 00:22:56.836
and the false [one] in which they live?

00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:13.510
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

00:23:13.711 --> 00:23:20.424
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

00:23:25.344 --> 00:23:29.155
and it worked in her.

00:23:34.101 --> 00:23:37.506
That was not the happiest day,

00:23:40.112 --> 00:23:46.058
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

00:23:50.893 --> 00:23:56.003
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

00:24:02.925 --> 00:24:07.151
We had a programme in Bordi

00:24:08.065 --> 00:24:12.560
in ’70,

00:24:13.047 --> 00:24:20.012
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

00:24:25.352 --> 00:24:32.478
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

00:24:35.742 --> 00:24:40.974
and they started talking of favouritism.

00:24:44.157 --> 00:24:50.132
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

00:24:54.547 --> 00:25:01.996
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

00:25:06.592 --> 00:25:10.494
I was in a great fury.

00:25:12.718 --> 00:25:17.249
I had never gone into such a fury before

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.796
and I lashed out at them.

00:25:26.647 --> 00:25:32.424
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

00:25:37.092 --> 00:25:41.339
That was the greatest moment.

00:25:42.658 --> 00:25:47.599
Then many got, one by one.

00:25:52.361 --> 00:25:55.938
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

00:25:56.139 --> 00:26:00.695
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:12.412
So the mass evolution started.

00:26:16.944 --> 00:26:21.467
Sahasrara is your awareness.

00:26:22.469 --> 00:26:26.045
When it is enlightened

00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:34.776
you get into the technique of the Divine.

00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:39.403
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

00:26:39.604 --> 00:26:43.734
and the technique that you follow.

00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:59.519
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:16.254
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:27.854
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:35.742
When your Sahasrara opens out

00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:45.102
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

00:27:50.643 --> 00:27:56.946
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

00:28:02.901 --> 00:28:11.629
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

00:28:16.439 --> 00:28:24.637
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:35.260
and your nadis get enlightened;

00:28:39.865 --> 00:28:42.554
not all of them,

00:28:42.755 --> 00:28:45.326
quite a lot of them;

00:28:45.527 --> 00:28:49.998
not all the length,

00:28:50.817 --> 00:28:55.067
but quite the peripheries.

00:28:57.727 --> 00:29:02.399
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

00:29:04.258 --> 00:29:07.444
So many things happen

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:14.468
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

00:29:19.613 --> 00:29:24.296
With the light you see their relative
positions.

00:29:27.624 --> 00:29:35.088
I mean you do not see, but it work
in your conscious mind.

00:29:40.923 --> 00:29:46.543
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

00:29:55.702 --> 00:30:03.938
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

00:30:09.979 --> 00:30:13.632
It becomes one with your attention.

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:18.749
Wherever your attention goes

00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:23.888
you act in a collective way.

00:30:25.365 --> 00:30:31.452
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

00:30:33.533 --> 00:30:39.429
The attention itself is effective.

00:30:40.907 --> 00:30:45.845
Your attention is very important,

00:30:48.188 --> 00:30:52.701
your desires are even more important.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:04.166
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

00:31:09.424 --> 00:31:12.765
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

00:31:12.966 --> 00:31:20.725
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

00:31:28.281 --> 00:31:32.229
The priorities change very fast.

00:31:34.731 --> 00:31:40.191
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

00:31:41.939 --> 00:31:46.166
may not find that happening

00:31:49.621 --> 00:31:54.029
but those who are over mentally developed,

00:31:55.738 --> 00:32:01.957
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

00:32:04.562 --> 00:32:08.187
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

00:32:08.388 --> 00:32:13.046
They want to see that it is logical.

00:32:20.325 --> 00:32:25.192
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:34.043
We have some people like that among us.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.167
They just became and they never questioned.

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:46.635
They just settled down.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.222
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

00:32:53.443 --> 00:32:57.663
above all they are spiritual.

00:33:00.006 --> 00:33:02.510
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

00:33:02.711 --> 00:33:06.751
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

00:33:12.055 --> 00:33:15.350
First of all you have to put down your ego

00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:20.309
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

00:33:24.301 --> 00:33:27.866
Also the super-ego must be reduced

00:33:28.067 --> 00:33:34.929
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:44.718
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:52.795
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

00:33:59.854 --> 00:34:06.604
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

00:34:11.431 --> 00:34:20.253
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

00:34:24.818 --> 00:34:29.144
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

00:34:30.892 --> 00:34:34.022
it closes back.

00:34:34.223 --> 00:34:37.731
That’s like a poison.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:44.030
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

00:34:48.143 --> 00:34:52.264
If you go about with the poison

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:58.715
then it again closes.

00:35:02.185 --> 00:35:09.228
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.837
and all other problems of the ego,

00:35:15.038 --> 00:35:20.602
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

00:35:22.874 --> 00:35:27.327
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

00:35:27.893 --> 00:35:33.446
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

00:35:36.093 --> 00:35:39.054
and wrong books,

00:35:39.255 --> 00:35:42.384
from wrong parents maybe,

00:35:42.585 --> 00:35:45.848
from a wrong country,

00:35:48.611 --> 00:35:52.393
from a wrong livelihood

00:35:53.506 --> 00:36:00.630
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

00:36:05.805 --> 00:36:11.562
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

00:36:15.929 --> 00:36:18.328
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

00:36:18.529 --> 00:36:25.873
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

00:36:32.866 --> 00:36:37.512
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:43.468
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

00:36:44.819 --> 00:36:50.757
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

00:36:50.958 --> 00:36:54.984
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

00:37:01.398 --> 00:37:07.618
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

00:37:13.691 --> 00:37:18.010
We have to have more and more channels

00:37:19.495 --> 00:37:25.127
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

00:37:29.565 --> 00:37:37.080
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:50.550
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

00:37:55.853 --> 00:38:00.267
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.991
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

00:38:15.009 --> 00:38:20.423
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

00:38:26.503 --> 00:38:31.753
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

00:38:31.962 --> 00:38:39.588
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

00:38:52.295 --> 00:38:55.615
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

00:38:55.816 --> 00:38:59.952
that he should not have bad company,

00:39:04.294 --> 00:39:09.191
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

00:39:11.899 --> 00:39:15.891
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

00:39:16.092 --> 00:39:22.664
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:37.259
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:46.604
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

00:39:59.017 --> 00:40:08.182
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

00:40:16.159 --> 00:40:20.637
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:27.858
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

00:40:30.923 --> 00:40:36.264
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

00:40:37.607 --> 00:40:44.161
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

00:40:49.393 --> 00:40:54.340
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

00:40:57.238 --> 00:41:01.625
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

00:41:04.262 --> 00:41:10.631
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

00:41:17.918 --> 00:41:22.463
so all other things must drop out.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.664
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

00:41:35.983 --> 00:41:39.232
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:45.920
that you can really correct yourself

00:41:52.611 --> 00:42:01.459
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

00:42:07.748 --> 00:42:13.443
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

00:42:16.795 --> 00:42:22.586
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

00:42:22.787 --> 00:42:30.222
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

00:42:34.256 --> 00:42:37.152
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

00:42:37.353 --> 00:42:43.084
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

00:42:51.212 --> 00:42:55.250
For that tolerance is needed,

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:00.628
wisdom is needed,

00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:05.831
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:13.601
which you are,

00:43:16.508 --> 00:43:20.451
and you should talk like a prophet.

00:43:25.127 --> 00:43:29.936
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

00:43:34.183 --> 00:43:40.678
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

00:43:41.862 --> 00:43:47.869
This is not insincere or acting

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.691
because now you are awakened.

00:43:55.391 --> 00:44:03.026
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

00:44:17.914 --> 00:44:31.288
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:48.966
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

00:44:54.333 --> 00:45:00.914
one has to watch one’s own growth.

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:08.927
Never justify your wrongdoings.

00:45:13.747 --> 00:45:20.406
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:28.176
We have no time to think about oneself.

00:45:31.757 --> 00:45:36.281
You have to think of others

00:45:36.482 --> 00:45:40.128
because others are also in your brain;

00:45:42.542 --> 00:45:46.492
and when you start thinking of others,

00:45:46.875 --> 00:45:52.649
talking to them about their resurrection,

00:45:55.492 --> 00:46:05.368
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

00:46:12.314 --> 00:46:15.919
The sensitivity will also increase,

00:46:16.866 --> 00:46:19.805
the depth will also come in.

00:46:20.982 --> 00:46:27.018
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

00:46:34.945 --> 00:46:38.880
So you have to come out of your shells

00:46:42.596 --> 00:46:46.048
and spread your wings.

00:46:46.811 --> 00:46:52.142
All small things of mind

00:46:55.636 --> 00:46:58.403
must be given up.

00:47:02.103 --> 00:47:09.429
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

00:47:16.365 --> 00:47:19.947
which has to give support,

00:47:20.877 --> 00:47:24.665
guidance, help

00:47:24.866 --> 00:47:29.718
and awakening to thousands.

00:47:30.795 --> 00:47:37.720
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

00:47:40.873 --> 00:47:47.201
establishes a new dynamism

00:47:48.909 --> 00:47:51.888
in this country,

00:47:53.009 --> 00:47:55.526
I am sure

00:47:56.377 --> 00:48:02.362
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:14.263
It will resound into their brains,

00:48:17.845 --> 00:48:22.742
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

00:48:27.617 --> 00:48:33.182
and they will start thinking afresh.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:42.976
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:55.581
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

00:49:00.996 --> 00:49:04.417
They’ll come to right conclusions.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.638
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

00:49:18.385 --> 00:49:23.032
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

00:49:24.931 --> 00:49:29.682
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

00:49:32.407 --> 00:49:35.538
The way you treat your Spirit

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:41.353
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

00:49:48.847 --> 00:49:56.735
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

00:50:00.967 --> 00:50:06.373
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:18.042
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

00:50:24.013 --> 00:50:28.608
And then you can become a subtle being.

00:50:30.165 --> 00:50:34.576
Through your conscious effort,

00:50:34.777 --> 00:50:40.934
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:50.969
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:58.323
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

00:51:04.214 --> 00:51:06.740
When you start developing higher and
higher,

00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:13.086
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

00:51:20.189 --> 00:51:23.559
You may not have any interest in many
things

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:31.279
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

00:51:36.495 --> 00:51:43.024
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

00:51:49.383 --> 00:51:58.554
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

00:52:05.024 --> 00:52:11.434
So you become the master of your brain

00:52:12.563 --> 00:52:17.732
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

00:52:19.704 --> 00:52:25.673
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

00:52:25.874 --> 00:52:31.590
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

00:52:36.742 --> 00:52:41.044
And the light of that expands

00:52:42.102 --> 00:52:47.232
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

00:52:50.449 --> 00:52:54.584
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

00:52:54.785 --> 00:52:58.953
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

00:52:59.154 --> 00:53:05.356
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

00:53:17.896 --> 00:53:26.339
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

00:53:31.198 --> 00:53:35.717
their obstinacy

00:53:35.918 --> 00:53:40.101
and childish pranks.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.004
Let the man rise

00:53:47.484 --> 00:53:53.680
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

00:53:56.951 --> 00:54:05.196
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

00:54:15.828 --> 00:54:26.747
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

00:54:26.956 --> 00:54:33.528
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

00:54:43.185 --> 00:54:47.163
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

00:54:47.364 --> 00:54:52.261
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

00:55:02.721 --> 00:55:06.731
That is what is your job,

00:55:08.748 --> 00:55:14.372
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

00:55:18.651 --> 00:55:26.965
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

00:55:27.166 --> 00:55:35.881
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

00:55:49.556 --> 00:55:53.798
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

00:55:53.999 --> 00:55:59.711
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

00:55:59.912 --> 00:56:07.216
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

00:56:19.654 --> 00:56:23.446
neglected by all the deities,

00:56:24.805 --> 00:56:30.476
because human beings really went very
wrong.

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:43.984
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

00:56:46.787 --> 00:56:51.127
because this is the attention,

00:56:54.129 --> 00:57:02.628
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

00:57:15.136 --> 00:57:21.706
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

00:57:25.628 --> 00:57:32.081
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.578
and  towards the eternal life.

00:57:38.634 --> 00:57:43.005
Is [a] very important country,

00:57:44.198 --> 00:57:49.512
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

00:57:53.045 --> 00:57:59.824
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

00:58:04.675 --> 00:58:08.930
They have to change their methods

00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:11.789
and styles.

00:58:12.387 --> 00:58:16.492
They should be very mild, gentle

00:58:17.597 --> 00:58:21.037
and healthy people

00:58:23.293 --> 00:58:28.648
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:34.750
so that when others see them

00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:39.659
[they] find that superiority in them.

00:58:43.533 --> 00:58:47.947
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

00:58:48.148 --> 00:58:51.140
I am very happy about you.

00:58:56.824 --> 00:59:00.213
May God bless you all.

00:59:01.136 --> 00:59:05.431
Now I bless all the other centres,

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:10.781
who have prayed and are praying;

00:59:10.982 --> 00:59:16.492
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

00:59:17.621 --> 00:59:20.623
an enlightened one,

00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:25.821
that will separate them from their small
shells.

00:59:27.703 --> 00:59:32.049
Let them expand so much,

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:39.016
that they become one with the whole.

00:59:39.217 --> 00:59:42.351
May God bless you all.

00:59:49.162 --> 00:59:52.336
May God bless you.

00:59:52.857 --> 00:59:55.762
Good (…)
