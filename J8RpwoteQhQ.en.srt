1
02:09:36,472 --> 02:09:46,857
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

2
02:09:48,447 --> 02:09:57,106
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

3
02:09:57,307 --> 02:10:06,388
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

4
02:10:06,589 --> 02:10:13,123
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

5
02:10:13,744 --> 02:10:20,084
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

6
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:29,871
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

7
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:33,502
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

8
02:10:33,703 --> 02:10:43,090
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

9
02:10:44,070 --> 02:10:48,410
And for that I have a plan.

10
02:10:48,611 --> 02:10:55,413
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

11
02:10:55,614 --> 02:11:01,563
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

12
02:11:01,764 --> 02:11:08,570
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

13
02:11:08,771 --> 02:11:13,527
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

14
02:11:13,728 --> 02:11:17,527
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

15
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:25,916
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

16
02:11:26,203 --> 02:11:34,013
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

17
02:11:34,655 --> 02:11:43,552
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

18
02:11:43,753 --> 02:11:49,144
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

19
02:11:49,345 --> 02:11:53,288
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

20
02:11:53,489 --> 02:12:01,443
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

21
02:12:01,644 --> 02:12:05,258
But not only in England, same in Paris:

22
02:12:05,459 --> 02:12:10,470
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

23
02:12:10,671 --> 02:12:15,047
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

24
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:19,876
This madness is on and on and on.

25
02:12:20,077 --> 02:12:26,557
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

26
02:12:26,758 --> 02:12:31,413
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

27
02:12:32,276 --> 02:12:36,951
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

28
02:12:37,152 --> 02:12:44,974
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

29
02:12:45,175 --> 02:12:51,547
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

30
02:12:51,748 --> 02:12:54,248
of these useless things?

31
02:12:54,424 --> 02:12:57,850
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

32
02:12:58,051 --> 02:13:05,115
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

33
02:13:05,316 --> 02:13:09,525
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

34
02:13:09,725 --> 02:13:14,666
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

35
02:13:14,867 --> 02:13:22,334
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

36
02:13:22,535 --> 02:13:25,143
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

37
02:13:25,344 --> 02:13:29,060
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

38
02:13:29,261 --> 02:13:37,234
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

39
02:13:37,435 --> 02:13:43,822
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

40
02:13:44,023 --> 02:13:50,235
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

41
02:13:52,310 --> 02:14:00,801
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

42
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:08,943
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

43
02:14:09,144 --> 02:14:12,384
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

44
02:14:12,585 --> 02:14:16,705
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

45
02:14:16,906 --> 02:14:22,219
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

46
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:25,156
So, it is against you.

47
02:14:25,357 --> 02:14:34,531
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

48
02:14:34,732 --> 02:14:40,325
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

49
02:14:40,526 --> 02:14:44,186
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

50
02:14:44,387 --> 02:14:54,923
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

51
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:59,218
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

52
02:14:59,419 --> 02:15:04,159
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

53
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:08,510
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

54
02:15:08,711 --> 02:15:16,563
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

55
02:15:17,757 --> 02:15:23,394
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

56
02:15:23,595 --> 02:15:28,305
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

57
02:15:28,583 --> 02:15:38,051
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

58
02:15:38,252 --> 02:15:41,723
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

59
02:15:41,924 --> 02:15:47,086
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

60
02:15:47,265 --> 02:15:53,089
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

61
02:15:53,289 --> 02:15:58,885
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

62
02:15:59,086 --> 02:16:04,218
Because wisdom itself shows

63
02:16:04,419 --> 02:16:10,483
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

64
02:16:11,048 --> 02:16:16,017
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

65
02:16:16,218 --> 02:16:20,194
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

66
02:16:20,395 --> 02:16:26,308
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

67
02:16:26,509 --> 02:16:35,542
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

68
02:16:35,743 --> 02:16:39,593
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

69
02:16:39,794 --> 02:16:44,358
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

70
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:48,499
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

71
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:54,288
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

72
02:16:54,489 --> 02:16:58,512
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

73
02:16:58,713 --> 02:17:04,463
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

74
02:17:04,664 --> 02:17:08,293
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

75
02:17:08,494 --> 02:17:13,881
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

76
02:17:14,082 --> 02:17:18,779
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

77
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:25,080
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

78
02:17:25,281 --> 02:17:31,368
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

79
02:17:31,569 --> 02:17:37,105
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

80
02:17:37,306 --> 02:17:43,064
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

81
02:17:43,228 --> 02:17:50,809
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

82
02:17:51,010 --> 02:17:56,243
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

83
02:17:56,444 --> 02:17:59,029
Evening time the car used to come,

84
02:17:59,230 --> 02:18:05,614
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

85
02:18:05,815 --> 02:18:11,672
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

86
02:18:11,873 --> 02:18:18,965
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

87
02:18:19,166 --> 02:18:23,196
At the most you can see some lamppost.

88
02:18:23,397 --> 02:18:29,178
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

89
02:18:29,378 --> 02:18:36,242
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

90
02:18:37,257 --> 02:18:44,062
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

91
02:18:44,245 --> 02:18:49,324
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

92
02:18:49,525 --> 02:18:53,594
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

93
02:18:53,795 --> 02:19:00,107
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

94
02:19:01,001 --> 02:19:06,645
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

95
02:19:06,846 --> 02:19:11,312
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

96
02:19:11,513 --> 02:19:16,314
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

97
02:19:17,159 --> 02:19:21,792
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

98
02:19:21,993 --> 02:19:28,439
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

99
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:37,740
Now see what has happened in, say,

100
02:19:37,941 --> 02:19:44,237
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

101
02:19:44,447 --> 02:19:49,229
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

102
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:52,483
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

103
02:19:52,684 --> 02:19:57,541
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

104
02:19:58,263 --> 02:20:03,024
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

105
02:20:03,225 --> 02:20:11,499
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

106
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:17,504
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

107
02:20:17,705 --> 02:20:21,910
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

108
02:20:22,111 --> 02:20:27,781
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

109
02:20:29,578 --> 02:20:33,550
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

110
02:20:33,727 --> 02:20:36,462
And it’s all working out everywhere.

111
02:20:36,663 --> 02:20:41,971
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

112
02:20:42,172 --> 02:20:49,239
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

113
02:20:50,672 --> 02:20:53,981
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

114
02:20:54,182 --> 02:20:59,870
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

115
02:21:00,031 --> 02:21:02,622
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

116
02:21:02,799 --> 02:21:06,577
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

117
02:21:06,778 --> 02:21:11,304
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

118
02:21:11,505 --> 02:21:16,205
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

119
02:21:19,553 --> 02:21:24,418
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

120
02:21:24,619 --> 02:21:27,469
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

121
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:33,484
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

122
02:21:33,685 --> 02:21:40,093
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

123
02:21:40,294 --> 02:21:44,813
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

124
02:21:45,014 --> 02:21:51,873
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

125
02:21:52,074 --> 02:22:02,196
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

126
02:22:02,397 --> 02:22:07,908
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

127
02:22:08,109 --> 02:22:10,455
So many have lost their money there,

128
02:22:10,632 --> 02:22:13,187
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

129
02:22:13,388 --> 02:22:17,608
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

130
02:22:17,809 --> 02:22:26,653
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

131
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:38,562
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

132
02:22:40,322 --> 02:22:45,990
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

133
02:22:46,331 --> 02:22:51,613
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

134
02:22:51,814 --> 02:22:58,876
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

135
02:22:59,082 --> 02:23:05,096
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

136
02:23:05,297 --> 02:23:10,382
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

137
02:23:10,583 --> 02:23:19,968
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

138
02:23:20,169 --> 02:23:23,119
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

139
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:27,713
because I spent money on My family things
also.

140
02:23:27,914 --> 02:23:34,925
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

141
02:23:35,108 --> 02:23:39,010
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

142
02:23:39,211 --> 02:23:45,844
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

143
02:23:46,045 --> 02:23:53,163
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

144
02:23:53,364 --> 02:23:56,991
Joy is much more in giving to others.

145
02:23:57,192 --> 02:24:05,480
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

146
02:24:05,681 --> 02:24:11,396
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

147
02:24:11,597 --> 02:24:19,364
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

148
02:24:19,565 --> 02:24:32,012
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

149
02:24:32,213 --> 02:24:37,035
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

150
02:24:37,236 --> 02:24:41,444
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

151
02:24:41,645 --> 02:24:46,228
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

152
02:24:46,429 --> 02:24:50,334
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

153
02:24:50,535 --> 02:24:55,890
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

154
02:24:56,091 --> 02:24:58,491
At least, there should be some embroidery,

155
02:24:58,692 --> 02:25:03,096
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

156
02:25:03,302 --> 02:25:07,694
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

157
02:25:07,895 --> 02:25:10,655
they are injurious to our health.

158
02:25:10,856 --> 02:25:15,995
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

159
02:25:16,196 --> 02:25:21,003
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

160
02:25:21,204 --> 02:25:26,749
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

161
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:30,133
how many of you know?

162
02:25:34,721 --> 02:25:43,036
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

163
02:25:43,237 --> 02:25:47,326
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

164
02:25:47,527 --> 02:25:54,406
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

165
02:25:54,607 --> 02:25:57,690
From where does this sari comes?

166
02:25:57,891 --> 02:26:03,672
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

167
02:26:03,873 --> 02:26:07,939
But even western men also have the same
problem.

168
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:12,198
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

169
02:26:12,394 --> 02:26:16,675
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

170
02:26:16,876 --> 02:26:20,122
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

171
02:26:20,323 --> 02:26:24,497
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

172
02:26:24,698 --> 02:26:30,893
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

173
02:26:32,557 --> 02:26:38,642
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

174
02:26:40,535 --> 02:26:47,829
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

175
02:26:48,030 --> 02:26:53,952
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

176
02:26:54,153 --> 02:26:57,878
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

177
02:26:58,079 --> 02:27:01,809
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

178
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:07,265
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

179
02:27:07,466 --> 02:27:14,733
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

180
02:27:14,934 --> 02:27:21,644
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

181
02:27:21,845 --> 02:27:28,712
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

182
02:27:28,913 --> 02:27:31,984
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

183
02:27:32,145 --> 02:27:35,996
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

184
02:27:36,197 --> 02:27:42,714
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

185
02:27:42,915 --> 02:27:47,942
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

186
02:27:48,143 --> 02:27:53,286
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

187
02:27:53,487 --> 02:28:00,320
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

188
02:28:00,521 --> 02:28:06,802
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

189
02:28:07,003 --> 02:28:12,310
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

190
02:28:12,511 --> 02:28:15,189
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

191
02:28:15,390 --> 02:28:19,452
this is red but it has green to match it.

192
02:28:19,653 --> 02:28:23,151
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

193
02:28:23,352 --> 02:28:28,382
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

194
02:28:28,583 --> 02:28:32,970
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

195
02:28:33,171 --> 02:28:36,957
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

196
02:28:38,401 --> 02:28:40,668
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

197
02:28:40,869 --> 02:28:43,882
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

198
02:28:44,083 --> 02:28:48,001
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

199
02:28:48,202 --> 02:28:52,312
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

200
02:28:52,513 --> 02:28:57,673
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

201
02:28:57,874 --> 02:29:01,492
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

202
02:29:01,693 --> 02:29:04,969
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

203
02:29:05,183 --> 02:29:10,533
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

204
02:29:10,734 --> 02:29:17,396
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

205
02:29:17,597 --> 02:29:24,530
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

206
02:29:24,731 --> 02:29:28,134
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

207
02:29:28,335 --> 02:29:31,751
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

208
02:29:31,952 --> 02:29:36,020
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

209
02:29:36,221 --> 02:29:40,402
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

210
02:29:40,603 --> 02:29:45,721
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

211
02:29:45,922 --> 02:29:51,145
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

212
02:29:51,346 --> 02:29:55,391
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

213
02:29:55,592 --> 02:29:59,350
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

214
02:29:59,551 --> 02:30:03,364
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

215
02:30:03,565 --> 02:30:06,343
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

216
02:30:06,544 --> 02:30:09,419
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

217
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:15,764
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

218
02:30:15,965 --> 02:30:20,445
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

219
02:30:20,646 --> 02:30:26,563
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

220
02:30:26,764 --> 02:30:29,581
I sold one of My ornaments

221
02:30:29,782 --> 02:30:34,477
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

222
02:30:34,677 --> 02:30:38,986
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

223
02:30:39,187 --> 02:30:49,931
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

224
02:30:50,558 --> 02:30:56,041
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

225
02:30:56,255 --> 02:31:01,697
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

226
02:31:02,985 --> 02:31:11,120
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

227
02:31:13,427 --> 02:31:16,641
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
 but I am missing him

228
02:31:16,842 --> 02:31:22,146
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

229
02:31:22,347 --> 02:31:24,826
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

230
02:31:25,027 --> 02:31:30,650
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

231
02:31:30,851 --> 02:31:36,828
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

232
02:31:37,029 --> 02:31:41,540
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

233
02:31:41,741 --> 02:31:47,992
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

234
02:31:50,393 --> 02:31:54,065
These small, small things can give you
great joy

235
02:31:54,266 --> 02:32:00,146
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

236
02:32:00,347 --> 02:32:04,929
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

237
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:07,411
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

238
02:32:07,612 --> 02:32:11,729
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

239
02:32:11,930 --> 02:32:16,072
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

240
02:32:16,273 --> 02:32:19,547
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

241
02:32:19,748 --> 02:32:26,931
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

242
02:32:27,132 --> 02:32:30,861
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

243
02:32:31,062 --> 02:32:33,765
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

244
02:32:33,966 --> 02:32:38,637
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

245
02:32:38,838 --> 02:32:43,567
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

246
02:32:43,768 --> 02:32:49,120
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

247
02:32:49,321 --> 02:32:53,482
I don’t even have time to see them.

248
02:32:54,389 --> 02:33:01,038
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

249
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:04,965
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

250
02:33:05,166 --> 02:33:09,147
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

251
02:33:09,356 --> 02:33:13,733
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

252
02:33:13,934 --> 02:33:20,035
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

253
02:33:20,236 --> 02:33:24,909
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

254
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:32,308
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

255
02:33:33,199 --> 02:33:36,956
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

256
02:33:37,157 --> 02:33:45,100
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

257
02:33:45,490 --> 02:33:51,003
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

258
02:33:51,204 --> 02:33:58,868
being absolutely beyond any problem.

259
02:33:59,171 --> 02:34:04,754
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

260
02:34:04,955 --> 02:34:10,761
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

261
02:34:10,962 --> 02:34:14,669
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

262
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:19,591
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

263
02:34:19,792 --> 02:34:26,047
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

264
02:34:27,165 --> 02:34:31,992
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

265
02:34:32,193 --> 02:34:36,395
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

266
02:34:36,596 --> 02:34:39,734
Only the designers they make the money.

267
02:34:39,934 --> 02:34:44,798
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

268
02:34:46,349 --> 02:34:54,221
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

269
02:34:55,469 --> 02:34:58,075
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

270
02:34:58,276 --> 02:35:03,369
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

271
02:35:03,570 --> 02:35:08,800
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

272
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:16,896
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

273
02:35:18,343 --> 02:35:22,354
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

274
02:35:22,555 --> 02:35:26,546
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

275
02:35:26,747 --> 02:35:31,737
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

276
02:35:31,945 --> 02:35:35,707
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

277
02:35:35,908 --> 02:35:42,132
So, I went to one shop in America

278
02:35:42,333 --> 02:35:45,317
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

279
02:35:45,518 --> 02:35:50,095
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

280
02:35:50,296 --> 02:35:56,832
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

281
02:35:57,033 --> 02:36:01,546
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

282
02:36:03,708 --> 02:36:11,703
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

283
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:20,412
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

284
02:36:20,613 --> 02:36:25,270
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

285
02:36:25,471 --> 02:36:30,100
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

286
02:36:30,735 --> 02:36:35,155
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

287
02:36:35,741 --> 02:36:38,887
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

288
02:36:39,088 --> 02:36:42,853
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

289
02:36:43,139 --> 02:36:47,134
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

290
02:36:47,335 --> 02:36:51,280
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

291
02:36:51,947 --> 02:36:56,109
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

292
02:36:56,310 --> 02:36:59,830
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

293
02:37:00,031 --> 02:37:04,396
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

294
02:37:04,597 --> 02:37:10,760
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

295
02:37:10,961 --> 02:37:15,631
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

296
02:37:15,832 --> 02:37:20,904
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

297
02:37:21,105 --> 02:37:25,592
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

298
02:37:25,793 --> 02:37:28,513
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

299
02:37:28,722 --> 02:37:37,376
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

300
02:37:39,809 --> 02:37:45,607
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

301
02:37:45,831 --> 02:37:49,065
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

302
02:37:49,266 --> 02:37:53,211
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

303
02:37:53,412 --> 02:37:57,825
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

304
02:37:58,026 --> 02:38:04,864
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

305
02:38:05,065 --> 02:38:11,294
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

306
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:17,465
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

307
02:38:17,666 --> 02:38:27,220
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

308
02:38:27,421 --> 02:38:31,986
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

309
02:38:32,187 --> 02:38:36,900
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

310
02:38:37,101 --> 02:38:41,072
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

311
02:38:41,286 --> 02:38:44,029
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

312
02:38:44,197 --> 02:38:47,318
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

313
02:38:47,519 --> 02:38:51,299
if they can get the same dinner set.

314
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:55,922
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

315
02:38:56,123 --> 02:39:05,684
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

316
02:39:05,885 --> 02:39:09,736
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

317
02:39:09,937 --> 02:39:13,972
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

318
02:39:14,173 --> 02:39:17,958
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

319
02:39:18,159 --> 02:39:25,554
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

320
02:39:25,842 --> 02:39:28,543
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

321
02:39:28,773 --> 02:39:31,576
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

322
02:39:31,777 --> 02:39:38,740
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

323
02:39:38,941 --> 02:39:44,862
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

324
02:39:45,584 --> 02:39:51,130
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

325
02:39:51,747 --> 02:39:57,851
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

326
02:40:00,178 --> 02:40:03,539
Just there you get it.

327
02:40:04,493 --> 02:40:09,973
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

328
02:40:10,183 --> 02:40:14,655
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

329
02:40:14,856 --> 02:40:18,372
if you don’t have greed about it.

330
02:40:18,579 --> 02:40:24,361
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

331
02:40:24,562 --> 02:40:31,067
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

332
02:40:31,268 --> 02:40:37,225
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

333
02:40:37,426 --> 02:40:43,519
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

334
02:40:44,178 --> 02:40:51,433
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

335
02:40:51,805 --> 02:40:55,274
And then the thing also gets lost.

336
02:40:55,475 --> 02:41:02,722
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

337
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:08,085
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

338
02:41:09,338 --> 02:41:13,049
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

339
02:41:13,250 --> 02:41:19,222
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

340
02:41:19,423 --> 02:41:25,022
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

341
02:41:25,223 --> 02:41:30,322
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

342
02:41:32,803 --> 02:41:42,169
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

343
02:41:48,231 --> 02:41:53,894
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

344
02:41:55,359 --> 02:42:01,211
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

345
02:42:01,412 --> 02:42:06,032
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

346
02:42:06,233 --> 02:42:13,035
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

347
02:42:14,677 --> 02:42:20,002
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

348
02:42:20,886 --> 02:42:23,475
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

349
02:42:23,676 --> 02:42:27,574
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

350
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:35,375
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

351
02:42:41,555 --> 02:42:44,901
They are mostly from Russia.

352
02:42:46,613 --> 02:42:55,354
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

353
02:42:55,555 --> 02:43:00,599
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

354
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:06,223
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

355
02:43:06,424 --> 02:43:10,307
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

356
02:43:10,508 --> 02:43:15,656
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

357
02:43:16,234 --> 02:43:20,362
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

358
02:43:20,563 --> 02:43:25,878
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

359
02:43:26,079 --> 02:43:30,013
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

360
02:43:30,214 --> 02:43:34,451
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

361
02:43:34,659 --> 02:43:39,894
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

362
02:43:41,070 --> 02:43:47,222
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

363
02:43:47,423 --> 02:43:52,456
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

364
02:43:52,657 --> 02:43:55,553
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

365
02:43:55,754 --> 02:43:59,403
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

366
02:43:59,604 --> 02:44:04,913
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

367
02:44:05,114 --> 02:44:10,724
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

368
02:44:10,925 --> 02:44:17,730
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

369
02:44:17,931 --> 02:44:23,935
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

370
02:44:24,729 --> 02:44:29,322
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

371
02:44:29,523 --> 02:44:35,336
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

372
02:44:36,228 --> 02:44:40,588
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

373
02:44:40,789 --> 02:44:44,759
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

374
02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:50,613
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

375
02:44:52,350 --> 02:45:02,189
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

376
02:45:02,390 --> 02:45:07,275
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

377
02:45:07,476 --> 02:45:14,574
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

378
02:45:15,905 --> 02:45:21,232
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

379
02:45:21,433 --> 02:45:27,463
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

380
02:45:28,105 --> 02:45:33,155
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

381
02:45:33,356 --> 02:45:39,361
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

382
02:45:39,562 --> 02:45:44,698
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

383
02:45:44,899 --> 02:45:49,587
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

384
02:45:49,788 --> 02:45:54,225
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

385
02:45:54,426 --> 02:46:00,206
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

386
02:46:00,407 --> 02:46:05,820
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

387
02:46:06,021 --> 02:46:13,058
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

388
02:46:13,848 --> 02:46:21,549
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

389
02:46:26,367 --> 02:46:33,922
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

390
02:46:34,123 --> 02:46:38,457
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

391
02:46:39,402 --> 02:46:44,541
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

392
02:46:44,742 --> 02:46:47,990
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

393
02:46:48,191 --> 02:46:51,370
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

394
02:46:51,571 --> 02:46:57,675
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

395
02:46:57,876 --> 02:47:00,996
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

396
02:47:01,197 --> 02:47:04,829
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

397
02:47:05,030 --> 02:47:08,776
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

398
02:47:08,977 --> 02:47:17,025
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

399
02:47:17,226 --> 02:47:21,633
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

400
02:47:21,834 --> 02:47:29,295
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

401
02:47:29,496 --> 02:47:34,452
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

402
02:47:34,653 --> 02:47:37,339
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

403
02:47:37,553 --> 02:47:41,485
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

404
02:47:41,686 --> 02:47:45,493
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

405
02:47:45,694 --> 02:47:48,159
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

406
02:47:48,360 --> 02:47:54,844
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

407
02:47:55,045 --> 02:48:02,178
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

408
02:48:02,379 --> 02:48:09,381
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

409
02:48:09,582 --> 02:48:13,007
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

410
02:48:13,208 --> 02:48:17,998
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

411
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:22,248
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

412
02:48:22,449 --> 02:48:28,277
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

413
02:48:28,478 --> 02:48:33,933
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

414
02:48:34,158 --> 02:48:37,862
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

415
02:48:38,063 --> 02:48:44,197
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

416
02:48:44,398 --> 02:48:49,453
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

417
02:48:49,654 --> 02:48:53,943
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

418
02:48:54,144 --> 02:48:58,388
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

419
02:48:58,589 --> 02:49:06,047
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

420
02:49:06,248 --> 02:49:10,018
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

421
02:49:10,219 --> 02:49:14,932
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

422
02:49:15,133 --> 02:49:17,876
that we have got the Spirit within us.

423
02:49:18,077 --> 02:49:23,607
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

424
02:49:23,808 --> 02:49:27,298
You are people who are all realized souls.

425
02:49:27,499 --> 02:49:32,368
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

426
02:49:32,569 --> 02:49:36,940
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

427
02:49:37,141 --> 02:49:44,757
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

428
02:49:44,958 --> 02:49:48,864
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

429
02:49:49,064 --> 02:49:56,055
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

430
02:49:56,256 --> 02:50:00,919
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

431
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:06,203
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

432
02:50:06,404 --> 02:50:09,608
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

433
02:50:09,809 --> 02:50:16,846
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

434
02:50:17,852 --> 02:50:21,457
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

435
02:50:21,658 --> 02:50:23,698
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

436
02:50:23,899 --> 02:50:28,389
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

437
02:50:28,590 --> 02:50:34,737
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

438
02:50:34,938 --> 02:50:41,947
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

439
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:48,459
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

440
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:53,655
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

441
02:50:53,856 --> 02:50:59,988
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

442
02:51:00,189 --> 02:51:04,618
it is absolutely a hell for man.

443
02:51:05,944 --> 02:51:11,865
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

444
02:51:12,066 --> 02:51:18,055
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

445
02:51:18,256 --> 02:51:23,127
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

446
02:51:23,272 --> 02:51:26,613
What pleases the husband?

447
02:51:28,125 --> 02:51:31,512
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

448
02:51:31,713 --> 02:51:37,407
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

449
02:51:37,608 --> 02:51:42,471
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

450
02:51:42,672 --> 02:51:46,332
First of all find out what he likes.

451
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:51,027
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

452
02:51:51,228 --> 02:51:54,093
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

453
02:51:54,294 --> 02:51:58,836
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

454
02:51:59,037 --> 02:52:04,532
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

455
02:52:04,733 --> 02:52:10,404
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

456
02:52:10,605 --> 02:52:13,960
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

457
02:52:14,161 --> 02:52:17,589
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

458
02:52:17,790 --> 02:52:24,672
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

459
02:52:24,873 --> 02:52:28,362
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

460
02:52:28,539 --> 02:52:32,650
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

461
02:52:32,851 --> 02:52:37,425
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

462
02:52:37,626 --> 02:52:41,058
because women are responsible
for the society.

463
02:52:41,259 --> 02:52:47,537
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

464
02:52:47,738 --> 02:52:52,353
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

465
02:52:52,554 --> 02:52:58,029
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

466
02:52:58,230 --> 02:53:02,649
But your job is to make the society.

467
02:53:02,850 --> 02:53:07,409
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

468
02:53:07,610 --> 02:53:11,993
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

469
02:53:12,194 --> 02:53:17,626
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

470
02:53:17,827 --> 02:53:20,430
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

471
02:53:20,631 --> 02:53:29,490
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

472
02:53:30,347 --> 02:53:36,043
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

473
02:53:37,753 --> 02:53:44,152
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

474
02:53:44,353 --> 02:53:49,940
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

475
02:53:50,141 --> 02:53:53,116
But there was one gentleman, good one,

476
02:53:53,317 --> 02:53:57,287
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

477
02:53:57,488 --> 02:54:01,338
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

478
02:54:01,539 --> 02:54:08,434
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

479
02:54:09,208 --> 02:54:12,171
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

480
02:54:12,372 --> 02:54:15,196
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

481
02:54:15,397 --> 02:54:22,224
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

482
02:54:22,425 --> 02:54:26,622
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

483
02:54:26,823 --> 02:54:32,196
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

484
02:54:32,397 --> 02:54:36,903
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

485
02:54:37,104 --> 02:54:41,702
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

486
02:54:41,903 --> 02:54:46,656
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

487
02:54:46,857 --> 02:54:50,782
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

488
02:54:50,983 --> 02:54:54,848
Immediately this competition.

489
02:55:00,283 --> 02:55:03,384
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

490
02:55:03,585 --> 02:55:06,550
even in London he was helping him a lot.

491
02:55:06,751 --> 02:55:12,702
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

492
02:55:12,903 --> 02:55:17,404
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

493
02:55:19,211 --> 02:55:23,107
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

494
02:55:23,308 --> 02:55:26,788
Otherwise for small, small things,

495
02:55:26,989 --> 02:55:31,572
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

496
02:55:31,773 --> 02:55:38,205
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

497
02:55:39,650 --> 02:55:44,427
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

498
02:55:44,628 --> 02:55:49,369
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

499
02:55:49,570 --> 02:55:55,110
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

500
02:55:55,311 --> 02:56:00,946
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

501
02:56:01,147 --> 02:56:03,518
 [Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

502
02:56:03,719 --> 02:56:08,294
she was married to somebody in USA.

503
02:56:08,495 --> 02:56:15,849
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

504
02:56:16,050 --> 02:56:19,527
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

505
02:56:19,728 --> 02:56:26,793
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

506
02:56:26,994 --> 02:56:33,325
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

507
02:56:33,526 --> 02:56:38,965
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

508
02:56:39,166 --> 02:56:44,551
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

509
02:56:44,752 --> 02:56:48,463
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

510
02:56:48,664 --> 02:56:53,738
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

511
02:56:53,939 --> 02:56:57,505
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

512
02:56:57,689 --> 02:57:04,223
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

513
02:57:04,424 --> 02:57:08,363
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

514
02:57:09,296 --> 02:57:18,929
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

515
02:57:19,130 --> 02:57:22,058
Why has he married?

516
02:57:22,259 --> 02:57:29,244
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

517
02:57:32,843 --> 02:57:35,235
 It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

518
02:57:35,436 --> 02:57:40,404
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

519
02:57:40,605 --> 02:57:43,855
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

520
02:57:44,056 --> 02:57:48,967
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

521
02:57:49,168 --> 02:57:53,459
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

522
02:57:53,941 --> 02:57:59,485
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

523
02:57:59,652 --> 02:58:04,723
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

524
02:58:04,924 --> 02:58:08,068
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

525
02:58:08,269 --> 02:58:12,202
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

526
02:58:12,403 --> 02:58:18,789
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

527
02:58:18,990 --> 02:58:24,413
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

528
02:58:24,614 --> 02:58:28,909
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

529
02:58:30,070 --> 02:58:35,418
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

530
02:58:35,595 --> 02:58:39,578
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

531
02:58:39,779 --> 02:58:47,112
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

532
02:58:49,251 --> 02:58:53,241
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

533
02:58:53,442 --> 02:58:56,114
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

534
02:58:56,315 --> 02:58:59,132
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

535
02:58:59,333 --> 02:59:04,669
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

536
02:59:06,848 --> 02:59:12,837
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

537
02:59:13,038 --> 02:59:17,898
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

538
02:59:22,109 --> 02:59:25,247
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

539
02:59:25,448 --> 02:59:29,195
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

540
02:59:29,396 --> 02:59:33,692
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

541
02:59:33,893 --> 02:59:39,126
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

542
02:59:40,764 --> 02:59:44,157
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

543
02:59:44,358 --> 02:59:47,839
try to understand why she does it.

544
02:59:48,040 --> 02:59:52,844
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

545
02:59:53,045 --> 02:59:58,632
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

546
02:59:58,833 --> 03:00:03,745
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

547
03:00:03,946 --> 03:00:09,426
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

548
03:00:09,627 --> 03:00:15,606
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

549
03:00:15,807 --> 03:00:20,059
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

550
03:00:20,260 --> 03:00:24,218
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

551
03:00:24,419 --> 03:00:28,873
and he is not there and this and that.”

552
03:00:29,189 --> 03:00:32,530
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

553
03:00:32,731 --> 03:00:38,136
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

554
03:00:38,337 --> 03:00:42,365
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

555
03:00:42,566 --> 03:00:45,356
I can’t understand the logic.

556
03:00:45,557 --> 03:00:50,054
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

557
03:00:50,255 --> 03:00:55,766
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

558
03:00:56,432 --> 03:01:05,036
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

559
03:01:05,237 --> 03:01:11,386
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

560
03:01:12,993 --> 03:01:15,579
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

561
03:01:15,780 --> 03:01:20,595
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

562
03:01:20,796 --> 03:01:26,144
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

563
03:01:26,345 --> 03:01:30,889
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

564
03:01:31,090 --> 03:01:36,354
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

565
03:01:36,555 --> 03:01:40,718
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

566
03:01:40,919 --> 03:01:44,174
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

567
03:01:44,825 --> 03:01:50,828
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

568
03:01:51,029 --> 03:01:54,659
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

569
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:59,929
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

570
03:02:00,114 --> 03:02:03,898
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

571
03:02:04,099 --> 03:02:06,706
So, with such an ignorance of things,

572
03:02:06,907 --> 03:02:11,822
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

573
03:02:13,342 --> 03:02:20,679
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

574
03:02:20,880 --> 03:02:25,460
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

575
03:02:25,668 --> 03:02:33,896
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

576
03:02:34,159 --> 03:02:37,008
He buys always very expensive things.

577
03:02:37,209 --> 03:02:41,444
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

578
03:02:41,645 --> 03:02:46,696
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

579
03:02:46,897 --> 03:02:52,279
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

580
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:57,422
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

581
03:02:57,623 --> 03:03:02,727
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

582
03:03:02,928 --> 03:03:08,691
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

583
03:03:08,892 --> 03:03:13,042
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

584
03:03:13,219 --> 03:03:16,861
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

585
03:03:17,062 --> 03:03:20,784
but he likes to give that only – all right.

586
03:03:20,985 --> 03:03:25,640
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

587
03:03:25,841 --> 03:03:29,794
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

588
03:03:29,995 --> 03:03:35,615
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

589
03:03:35,816 --> 03:03:40,648
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

590
03:03:40,849 --> 03:03:47,516
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

591
03:03:47,717 --> 03:03:54,254
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

592
03:03:54,455 --> 03:03:57,388
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

593
03:03:57,589 --> 03:04:02,258
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

594
03:04:02,459 --> 03:04:06,033
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

595
03:04:06,234 --> 03:04:10,143
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

596
03:04:10,344 --> 03:04:13,395
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

597
03:04:13,596 --> 03:04:16,967
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

598
03:04:17,168 --> 03:04:22,949
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

599
03:04:23,150 --> 03:04:28,321
[Hindi aside]

600
03:04:28,531 --> 03:04:31,761
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

601
03:04:31,975 --> 03:04:35,897
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

602
03:04:36,098 --> 03:04:39,989
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

603
03:04:40,190 --> 03:04:44,511
I was walking like a giant, you know.

604
03:04:50,740 --> 03:04:55,063
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

605
03:04:55,264 --> 03:04:59,299
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

606
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:02,576
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

607
03:05:02,777 --> 03:05:07,008
I sat in one place glued down into that.

608
03:05:07,209 --> 03:05:12,468
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

609
03:05:12,669 --> 03:05:18,180
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

610
03:05:18,381 --> 03:05:21,768
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

611
03:05:21,969 --> 03:05:25,902
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

612
03:05:26,103 --> 03:05:31,998
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

613
03:05:32,752 --> 03:05:35,276
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

614
03:05:35,441 --> 03:05:40,322
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

615
03:05:40,523 --> 03:05:43,206
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

616
03:05:43,407 --> 03:05:49,735
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

617
03:05:49,959 --> 03:05:56,488
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

618
03:05:56,689 --> 03:06:01,562
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

619
03:06:01,763 --> 03:06:05,002
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

620
03:06:05,203 --> 03:06:08,300
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

621
03:06:08,500 --> 03:06:13,992
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

622
03:06:14,193 --> 03:06:17,138
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

623
03:06:17,339 --> 03:06:20,826
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

624
03:06:21,027 --> 03:06:25,983
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

625
03:06:28,979 --> 03:06:31,171
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

626
03:06:31,372 --> 03:06:34,116
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

627
03:06:34,317 --> 03:06:39,432
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

628
03:06:39,633 --> 03:06:42,332
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

629
03:06:42,533 --> 03:06:48,484
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

630
03:06:48,685 --> 03:06:53,370
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

631
03:06:53,571 --> 03:06:59,208
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

632
03:06:59,394 --> 03:07:01,006
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

633
03:07:01,207 --> 03:07:04,296
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

634
03:07:04,497 --> 03:07:08,267
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

635
03:07:08,468 --> 03:07:12,674
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

636
03:07:12,875 --> 03:07:17,452
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

637
03:07:17,653 --> 03:07:22,583
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

638
03:07:24,737 --> 03:07:29,012
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

639
03:07:29,197 --> 03:07:35,145
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

640
03:07:35,346 --> 03:07:39,281
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

641
03:07:39,482 --> 03:07:45,469
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

642
03:07:45,670 --> 03:07:48,055
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

643
03:07:48,256 --> 03:07:52,936
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

644
03:07:53,111 --> 03:07:57,301
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

645
03:07:57,501 --> 03:08:00,406
You are not going to beat (them).

646
03:08:01,484 --> 03:08:06,723
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

647
03:08:06,924 --> 03:08:09,851
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

648
03:08:10,052 --> 03:08:13,825
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

649
03:08:14,026 --> 03:08:17,835
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

650
03:08:18,036 --> 03:08:21,694
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

651
03:08:21,895 --> 03:08:26,618
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

652
03:08:26,819 --> 03:08:33,836
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

653
03:08:34,037 --> 03:08:38,511
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

654
03:08:38,719 --> 03:08:46,961
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

655
03:08:47,162 --> 03:08:52,542
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

656
03:08:52,743 --> 03:08:59,165
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

657
03:08:59,372 --> 03:09:02,855
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

658
03:09:03,056 --> 03:09:05,622
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

659
03:09:05,823 --> 03:09:10,896
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

660
03:09:11,097 --> 03:09:13,640
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

661
03:09:13,841 --> 03:09:19,045
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

662
03:09:19,246 --> 03:09:25,856
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

663
03:09:26,057 --> 03:09:28,878
In India no woman will do that.

664
03:09:29,079 --> 03:09:33,438
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

665
03:09:39,088 --> 03:09:45,066
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

666
03:09:45,267 --> 03:09:48,499
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

667
03:09:48,700 --> 03:09:52,889
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

668
03:09:53,090 --> 03:09:55,988
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

669
03:09:56,189 --> 03:10:02,474
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

670
03:10:02,675 --> 03:10:06,066
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

671
03:10:06,267 --> 03:10:09,087
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

672
03:10:09,288 --> 03:10:13,148
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

673
03:10:13,349 --> 03:10:17,159
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

674
03:10:17,360 --> 03:10:24,505
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

675
03:10:24,706 --> 03:10:28,759
But this Western women never understand.

676
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:34,974
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

677
03:10:35,174 --> 03:10:40,625
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

678
03:10:40,826 --> 03:10:44,337
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

679
03:10:44,538 --> 03:10:48,649
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

680
03:10:48,850 --> 03:10:53,504
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

681
03:10:53,705 --> 03:10:58,905
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

682
03:10:59,106 --> 03:11:07,486
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

683
03:11:07,687 --> 03:11:15,120
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

684
03:11:15,321 --> 03:11:18,534
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

685
03:11:18,735 --> 03:11:24,542
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

686
03:11:24,743 --> 03:11:27,396
This is very Western, I must say.

687
03:11:27,597 --> 03:11:34,436
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

688
03:11:34,714 --> 03:11:40,333
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

689
03:11:40,534 --> 03:11:44,305
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

690
03:11:44,506 --> 03:11:48,585
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

691
03:11:48,786 --> 03:11:52,318
This is not the way a woman should look.

692
03:11:52,519 --> 03:11:57,229
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

693
03:11:57,430 --> 03:12:03,656
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

694
03:12:03,857 --> 03:12:11,370
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

695
03:12:11,571 --> 03:12:16,200
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

696
03:12:16,401 --> 03:12:20,521
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

697
03:12:20,722 --> 03:12:23,766
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

698
03:12:23,967 --> 03:12:34,170
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

699
03:12:34,371 --> 03:12:41,976
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

700
03:12:46,379 --> 03:12:51,582
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

701
03:12:51,767 --> 03:12:54,194
Who are you to like or not like?

702
03:12:54,395 --> 03:12:59,332
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

703
03:12:59,533 --> 03:13:05,723
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

704
03:13:05,932 --> 03:13:13,727
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

705
03:13:13,928 --> 03:13:18,513
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

706
03:13:18,714 --> 03:13:23,223
and should have very, very large hearts.

707
03:13:26,823 --> 03:13:35,434
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

708
03:13:35,635 --> 03:13:38,839
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

709
03:13:39,040 --> 03:13:44,854
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

710
03:13:47,371 --> 03:13:52,552
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

711
03:13:52,753 --> 03:13:59,766
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

712
03:13:59,967 --> 03:14:04,823
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

713
03:14:05,024 --> 03:14:08,130
very, very good reports about them.

714
03:14:08,331 --> 03:14:13,234
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

715
03:14:13,435 --> 03:14:16,594
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

716
03:14:16,795 --> 03:14:22,766
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

717
03:14:22,967 --> 03:14:30,565
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

718
03:14:30,766 --> 03:14:33,617
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

719
03:14:33,818 --> 03:14:37,383
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

720
03:14:37,951 --> 03:14:40,666
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

721
03:14:40,867 --> 03:14:44,553
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

722
03:14:44,754 --> 03:14:49,545
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

723
03:14:49,746 --> 03:14:53,493
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

724
03:14:53,694 --> 03:14:57,963
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

725
03:14:58,164 --> 03:15:01,394
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

726
03:15:01,595 --> 03:15:05,995
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

727
03:15:06,227 --> 03:15:12,508
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

728
03:15:12,678 --> 03:15:15,822
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

729
03:15:16,023 --> 03:15:21,528
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

730
03:15:21,729 --> 03:15:24,249
thanks to Swiss influence.

731
03:15:24,450 --> 03:15:29,424
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

732
03:15:29,631 --> 03:15:35,108
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

733
03:15:35,309 --> 03:15:39,891
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

734
03:15:45,129 --> 03:15:49,144
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

735
03:15:49,345 --> 03:15:54,670
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

736
03:15:54,871 --> 03:16:01,772
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

737
03:16:03,088 --> 03:16:06,250
This is the book. You all should buy it.

738
03:16:06,451 --> 03:16:09,865
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

739
03:16:10,066 --> 03:16:13,384
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

740
03:16:35,804 --> 03:16:39,070
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

741
03:16:39,271 --> 03:16:42,851
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

742
03:16:43,052 --> 03:16:47,901
So, you will understand about Indian music.

743
03:16:48,102 --> 03:16:54,300
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

744
03:16:54,734 --> 03:17:01,615
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

745
03:17:01,816 --> 03:17:08,067
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

746
03:17:08,268 --> 03:17:13,004
who were singing western song, was alright.

747
03:17:13,205 --> 03:17:18,339
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

748
03:17:18,540 --> 03:17:21,782
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

749
03:17:21,983 --> 03:17:25,580
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

750
03:17:25,781 --> 03:17:29,849
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

751
03:17:30,050 --> 03:17:33,497
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

752
03:17:33,698 --> 03:17:37,938
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

753
03:17:38,139 --> 03:17:42,248
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

754
03:17:42,425 --> 03:17:47,946
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

755
03:17:48,147 --> 03:17:56,009
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

756
03:17:56,210 --> 03:17:59,846
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

757
03:18:00,047 --> 03:18:06,446
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

758
03:18:06,647 --> 03:18:10,816
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

759
03:18:11,017 --> 03:18:13,575
They are having all this horrible music
there.

760
03:18:13,776 --> 03:18:19,196
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

761
03:18:19,397 --> 03:18:23,582
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

762
03:18:23,763 --> 03:18:30,905
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

763
03:18:31,073 --> 03:18:35,412
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

764
03:18:35,613 --> 03:18:39,512
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

765
03:18:39,713 --> 03:18:42,343
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

766
03:18:42,544 --> 03:18:47,501
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

767
03:18:47,701 --> 03:18:52,482
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

768
03:18:52,707 --> 03:18:56,142
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

769
03:18:56,343 --> 03:19:00,837
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

770
03:19:01,038 --> 03:19:10,714
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

771
03:19:10,915 --> 03:19:17,359
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

772
03:19:17,560 --> 03:19:28,388
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

773
03:19:28,589 --> 03:19:33,135
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

774
03:19:33,336 --> 03:19:39,322
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

775
03:19:39,522 --> 03:19:41,463
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

776
03:19:41,664 --> 03:19:45,573
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

777
03:19:45,774 --> 03:19:49,947
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

778
03:19:50,148 --> 03:19:53,592
you will see how different it will be.

779
03:19:55,729 --> 03:19:59,313
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

780
03:19:59,514 --> 03:20:02,158
which you should have, and which you should
understand

781
03:20:02,359 --> 03:20:11,594
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

782
03:20:11,795 --> 03:20:18,092
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

783
03:20:18,293 --> 03:20:23,530
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

784
03:20:23,691 --> 03:20:29,734
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

785
03:20:31,183 --> 03:20:34,812
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

786
03:20:35,013 --> 03:20:38,995
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

787
03:20:39,196 --> 03:20:44,590
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

788
03:20:44,791 --> 03:20:47,539
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

789
03:20:47,740 --> 03:20:51,432
Then you can expand it as you like.

790
03:20:51,633 --> 03:20:57,757
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

791
03:20:57,958 --> 03:21:02,222
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

792
03:21:02,423 --> 03:21:08,701
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

793
03:21:08,989 --> 03:21:15,553
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

794
03:21:16,085 --> 03:21:18,424
Accha.

795
03:21:18,625 --> 03:21:23,392
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

796
03:21:23,593 --> 03:21:29,966
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

797
03:21:30,167 --> 03:21:39,888
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

798
03:21:40,315 --> 03:21:48,451
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

799
03:21:52,489 --> 03:21:57,392
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

800
03:21:57,593 --> 03:22:04,682
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

801
03:22:04,883 --> 03:22:13,132
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

802
03:22:13,333 --> 03:22:20,069
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

803
03:22:20,270 --> 03:22:28,590
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

804
03:22:28,791 --> 03:22:36,857
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

805
03:22:37,058 --> 03:22:41,965
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

806
03:22:42,140 --> 03:22:46,256
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

807
03:22:46,457 --> 03:22:53,081
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

808
03:22:53,282 --> 03:22:58,638
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

809
03:22:59,011 --> 03:23:05,810
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

810
03:23:06,011 --> 03:23:13,587
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

811
03:23:13,788 --> 03:23:20,293
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

812
03:23:20,494 --> 03:23:26,283
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

813
03:23:26,484 --> 03:23:29,790
Because when you try to do something wrong

814
03:23:29,991 --> 03:23:34,087
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

815
03:23:36,769 --> 03:23:41,056
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

816
03:23:41,257 --> 03:23:47,141
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

817
03:23:47,342 --> 03:23:53,206
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

818
03:23:53,407 --> 03:23:57,063
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

819
03:23:57,264 --> 03:24:02,125
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

820
03:24:02,326 --> 03:24:06,510
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

821
03:24:06,711 --> 03:24:11,649
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

822
03:24:11,850 --> 03:24:15,290
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

823
03:24:15,491 --> 03:24:18,978
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

824
03:24:19,179 --> 03:24:24,744
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

825
03:24:26,518 --> 03:24:32,592
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

826
03:24:32,793 --> 03:24:37,137
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

827
03:24:37,337 --> 03:24:41,044
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

828
03:24:41,245 --> 03:24:46,328
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

829
03:24:46,529 --> 03:24:51,112
than father, mother, even Mataji.

830
03:24:52,413 --> 03:24:57,342
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

831
03:24:58,282 --> 03:25:00,555
So, thank you very much.
