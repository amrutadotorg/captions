05:23.709 --> 05:26.875
It’s beyond Me to really express

05:28.999 --> 05:32.667
the great joy

05:34.834 --> 05:40.875
that I see in your hearts,

05:41.917 --> 05:44.709
reflected in My heart.

05:46.208 --> 05:49.250
Today’s a great day I think,

05:50.166 --> 05:54.208
that we have come to a place

05:54.417 --> 05:57.999
which is in Italy

05:58.542 --> 06:02.375
and the Austrians are going to do the Guru Puja.

06:06.333 --> 06:10.375
Because it’s such an integration of understanding.

06:20.208 --> 06:26.083
It’s a very new beginning of a new world,

06:26.750 --> 06:30.792
the vision of which I had since long,

06:31.000 --> 06:35.834
because this world is one, created by one God.

06:36.125 --> 06:41.375
All these demarcations are man-made

06:41.625 --> 06:44.667
and they create problems.

06:45.959 --> 06:51.375
In Sahaja Yoga you realize that we are all one

06:51.875 --> 06:56.417
part and parcel of one great Virata.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.000
This has to be understood,

07:03.041 --> 07:04.834
that

07:07.166 --> 07:10.750
this joy comes out of the love

07:10.999 --> 07:14.875
and affection we have for each other

07:15.041 --> 07:19.999
and for our Mother and the Creator.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.875
So open your heart

07:27.083 --> 07:29.959
open your heart.

07:32.792 --> 07:39.750
And everything will be enjoyable, beautiful,

07:40.208 --> 07:42.667
and you will feel

07:44.709 --> 07:48.792
the ambrosia trickling into your being,

07:48.999 --> 07:53.417
into your nerves all around you.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.583
The joy can be only complete

07:58.834 --> 08:00.750
when you can receive it

08:00.959 --> 08:03.999
every minute, every moment.

08:05.583 --> 08:09.542
And that is what I want all of you to have.

08:09.792 --> 08:12.125
That’s My pure desire.

08:12.333 --> 08:15.667
May God bless you all.
