1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,563
I’ll talk before and then at the time you
can just tell me what time it is.

2
00:00:15,764 --> 00:00:22,542
The radio is off? You can keep it till
eight o’clock and…

3
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:45,940
So happy to wait on you.

4
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:58,936
Today we are celebrating a day

5
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:06,678
which is a very, very important,

6
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:12,588
absolutely the most important, we can say,
day,

7
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:19,346
when such a great happening took
place.

8
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:25,161
And it had to take place that way –

9
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,090
it was all in a way destined.

10
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:45,809
In my last lectures I have told you

11
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:54,734
how Christ was created first
in the heavens.

12
00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:05,980
In the Devi Mahatmya, if you read that,
He was created as Mahavishnu

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:16,280
and is mentioned very clearly, that first
He was created as an egg.

14
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:23,784
It is written in this book, which perhaps
was written about 14,000 years back.

15
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:29,059
It’s a book that predicts about Christ,

16
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:35,247
and that is why people in the West,
specially,

17
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,964
offer an egg to each other as a friend.

18
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:45,256
The first existence came on this Earth
as an egg, that was Christ,

19
00:02:45,457 --> 00:03:00,056
and part of it was kept in that state
and the rest of it was used

20
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:10,502
by the Holy Ghost, by Mahalakshmi,
to create Christ out of it.

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,306
In that ancient book He was called
as Mahavishnu;

22
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:19,626
means the greater form of Vishnu.

23
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:22,860
But actually Vishnu is the father

24
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:28,923
and He is the Son created by the Holy
Ghost.

25
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:33,880
After my lecture I would like, if you have
the book, to read it out to them,

26
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:39,023
the whole texts of how Christ was created.

27
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:48,806
And when He was created, He cried
for His Father,

28
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:54,362
as He cried also on the cross once.

29
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,047
And He cried for years.

30
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:09,187
And then Christ, in Mahavishnu state
was blessed by His Father

31
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:14,407
who said that, “Your position will be
placed higher than Mine.

32
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:18,420
And You will be the Adhara,” means
the ‘Support of the Universe’.

33
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:24,166
See, how from Mooladhara He becomes
the Adhara.

34
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:32,566
This was all done at the heavenly stage -

35
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:36,531
Vaikuntha stage you can say.

36
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:43,272
Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost,

37
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:48,443
who was the mother of Christ on this
Earth,

38
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:54,936
who was nobody else but was the incarnation
of Mahalakshmi; means She was Radha.

39
00:04:55,137 --> 00:05:01,420
Ra-dha. ‘Ra’ means energy, ‘dha’ means
the one who sustains the energy.

40
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:11,272
There are many aspects of Easter one
has to understand,

41
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:18,920
but the most of all is why did He die and
why was He resurrected?

42
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:24,189
This point I have not yet touched, perhaps,
so clearly.

43
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,663
That’s the point I want to tell you today.

44
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:32,273
It’s only you people can understand
the importance of the life of Christ.

45
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:41,206
And when it is said that you have to get
your realisation through Christ,

46
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:46,734
it means that He had to pierce through
the Agnya chakra.

47
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:52,351
He had to be there. If He had not created

48
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:58,169
this gap in the gate, we could never have
got realisation.

49
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,956
That is why it is said that you are to pass
through

50
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:14,254
the gates of heaven only with the grace
of Christ.

51
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,482
Of course, that doesn’t mean churches,
it doesn’t mean at all churches.

52
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:21,091
That you understand as sahaja yogis that
you have to pass through the Agnya chakra.

53
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:26,340
Ultimately that’s the most difficult point
where human beings have to pass.

54
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:34,326
Because, at the Agnya chakra, your ego
and superego are fully grown.

55
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,786
At the human stage only this ego
is developed.

56
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:43,368
Now how to overcome the ego was a point.

57
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:50,574
And to overcome the ego, Christ had
to do this.

58
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:57,837
When He was created in the beginning
as Shri Ganesha -

59
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:07,396
you know the story how He was created,
that the mala,

60
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:18,008
is the - from the body of Parvati, the Holy
Ghost, was taken out,

61
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:24,816
because before Her marriage, She was -

62
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:32,521
She had to cover Herself for Her bath
with many scented things.

63
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:37,726
And it was taken out, all these things,
and Her vibrations came out.

64
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:41,748
And She created this child just to protect
Her chastity;

65
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:47,664
outside Her bathroom She put him. And
you know the whole story about it.

66
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:53,725
Now there was a part of the element
of the earth in that child.

67
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:57,595
Pruthvi-tattwa, was there.

68
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:09,458
All other centres - all other centres have
got some elements in them.

69
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:15,291
Some elements like pruthvi-tattwa is there,
earth element;

70
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:20,335
then you have got water element, then
you have got air element,

71
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:29,696
and when you come to this it is the light
element, it’s the light.

72
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,051
And at this point, at Agnya chakra,

73
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:42,160
He had to cross the last element, that
was the light element.

74
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:46,424
That means He had to come out into
the true form

75
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:55,204
of only the Divine Power, the Omkara,
the vibrations you can call it;

76
00:08:55,405 --> 00:09:03,237
or the absolute -

77
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:08,227
you call it logos or something like that?
The first sound, Brahma.

78
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,739
So He had to become the principle
of Brahma.

79
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,662
To become the principle of Brahma,

80
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:18,706
He had to get rid of all other elements
within Him.

81
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:25,124
So the last was also the light element,
which He had to cross through.

82
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:30,359
So He had earth element in Him, as He
was of the mala,

83
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,534
and all other elements within Him.
But when it comes to the Agnya,

84
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:39,392
He had to give up all the elements,
that He had to die

85
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:42,375
the death of all these elements that were
within Him,

86
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:47,819
to become complete, absolutely pure
Spirit.

87
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:56,081
What He did on subtle form works out
on the gross form,

88
00:09:57,174 --> 00:10:04,850
and to do that He had to die. And
whatever died in Him,

89
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:08,221
was that little element of earth element
and other elements,

90
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:13,063
and what came out of Him was pure Spirit.

91
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:16,123
[To somebody: “Just move forward.”]

92
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:21,265
Was pure Spirit that was resurrected;
the pure Spirit,

93
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:28,543
the pure Brahma-Tattwa which had formed
the body of Christ,

94
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:32,922
which was the body of Christ.

95
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:39,738
And this happening came -

96
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:47,247
Christ has done what was predicted
about Him -

97
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:54,506
that He is the saviour, because He passed
through that gate

98
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:59,872
to take people from this bodily existence,

99
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:06,289
means the one that depends on the elements,

100
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,094
to that existence which is Spirit.

101
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:17,586
So the resurrection is where you become,
from your attention,

102
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:22,393
you jump into the attention of the Spirit.

103
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:29,916
When you feel your attention, when you
become the Spirit.

104
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:38,322
That is the happening which has happened
to you also.

105
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:45,155
But He became pure Spirit, pure Brahma
Tattwa when He was resurrected.

106
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:54,729
And the resurrection is a happening
of the Divine Power

107
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:04,413
which came from Mooladhara chakra as just
earth element, started growing.

108
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:08,854
It took its birth from there, came up
to Agnya chakra.

109
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:17,250
There Christ was created to pass through
all the elements,

110
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:22,660
ultimately to enter into the Sahasrara

111
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:28,321
to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.

112
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:39,999
And this was a very difficult thing,
was very experimental.

113
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:45,849
And the experiment was quite a dangerous
one.

114
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:54,085
It could have failed also, because He had
in Him

115
00:12:54,317 --> 00:13:01,682
that human element, the body element
which suffered.

116
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:09,118
And He suffered, because this body element
suffers, not the Spirit;

117
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:13,154
Spirit does not suffer. The body element
suffers.

118
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:23,532
So He had to suffer that body element
and to get over it, to get out of it.

119
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:36,950
And to get out of it He had to have
a tremendous courage.

120
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:43,378
It was such a difficult operation.

121
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:47,706
Without Him nobody could have achieved.

122
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,931
He knew it was predestined,

123
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:58,765
but it was one of the most difficult things
to happen.

124
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:05,002
I wonder how many Christians know
the significance of an egg.

125
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:13,471
Now egg signifies a stage where you are
before realisation,

126
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:20,987
when you are in your eggshell; that you
are Mr. X, you are Mrs. Y, all that.

127
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:25,367
But when you mature fully inside,

128
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:30,781
the bird is ready and that is the time
you are hatched.

129
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:34,541
This is the time you get twice born.

130
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:39,372
So, actually the resurrection of Christ
signifies that,

131
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:45,276
and that’s why we give that egg to people
saying,

132
00:14:45,477 --> 00:14:52,202
“You are an egg”, a reminder of that, and
this egg can become the Spirit.

133
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:56,700
And also it is written that it was an egg
when He came.

134
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:03,993
First He was created as an egg. Half of it
remained as Shri Ganesha

135
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:08,368
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

136
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:14,429
Then He came on this earth and He departed
with all His elements

137
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,272
and the pure vibrations formed His body,

138
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:27,534
and He remained there within all of you,
to be awakened.

139
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:35,591
And when the Kundalini takes your attention
through that point,

140
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:40,265
there you also become the Spirit.

141
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:45,372
That’s why He said that, “I’m the gate,
I’m the door.”

142
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:50,309
He didn’t say, “I’m the destination.”
He said, “I’m the door,”

143
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,069
because you cannot become Christ.

144
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,866
That’s why he didn’t say, “I’m the
destination,” that you have to achieve Him.

145
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:03,499
But He has created this space for you.

146
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:11,890
You can become spiritually awakened;
you can become your Spirit.

147
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:17,617
But Christ is an incarnation, He was
the Son of God.

148
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:23,380
And so He is an incarnation, and that
incarnation came on this earth

149
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:32,378
just to pull you out of your elements,
to make you become the Spirit.

150
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:39,284
Now how is it that it was the most
difficult thing?

151
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:47,085
Because human beings have created in their
heads all kinds of artificial barriers.

152
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,760
You see, whatever we think and whatever
we do with our mind

153
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,769
is all dead, is man-made, is artificial.

154
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,457
Because reality is beyond your mind;
it is not in your mind.

155
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:03,151
You cannot conceive it; you cannot hold it.

156
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:08,704
Whatever is in your mind is not
the reality, it is beyond.

157
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:14,853
So, for a human being to accept something
that is beyond mind

158
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:17,328
had become so difficult at the time
of Christ,

159
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,994
because of Romans and all these people
coming up.

160
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,770
And we are repeating the history again.

161
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,574
They were so ego-oriented, they were
so full of ego

162
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:37,246
that to destroy their ego somebody had
to do this to create a passage.

163
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,677
By His death so many things are proved,
that all those who crucified Him

164
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:47,707
were stupid people, they were ego-oriented,
they were blind.

165
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:51,154
They could not see what He was.

166
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:56,920
They could not see what a genuine
personality He was.

167
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:00,960
They crucified Him.

168
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:07,847
I mean, it’s the greatest stupidity. And
they crucified Him,

169
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:11,438
it was all known because these people
were so stupid

170
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:15,014
that they would have only crucified Him,
what else they could do?

171
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:19,691
Because they couldn’t bear, with their
little egos, somebody who is so simple,

172
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:23,029
who is so genuine, who is so true.

173
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:32,015
So they crucified Him and that crucifixion
came as a breakthrough for us.

174
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:36,257
But message for us is the resurrection
part.

175
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:41,492
Message for us is the resurrection, and
not crucifixion.

176
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:45,561
Crucifixion is not the message, because
He’s done it for us.

177
00:18:45,762 --> 00:18:51,539
This is the point where Jews must
understand.

178
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:55,842
The other day I was reading - today only -

179
00:18:56,043 --> 00:19:04,104
some discussion with the Archbishop
of Canterbury took place.

180
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:08,752
And the fellow who was asking him was
asking him questions

181
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:13,682
as if he was asking questions to God.

182
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:18,780
In a way he said so also that, “I would
ask this question to God,

183
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:22,401
that, why is it so many Jews were killed?”

184
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,317
They asked for it.

185
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:29,751
They wanted that they must suffer

186
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:33,366
because they wouldn’t give the credit
of suffering to Christ.

187
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:37,061
They thought, “We all have to suffer.”
Ego. It’s ego.

188
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:42,409
“How dare anybody suffer for us? We must
suffer separately.”

189
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:44,710
They couldn’t give that credit to Christ

190
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:52,981
and all the later thinking was that,
“We must suffer.”

191
00:19:53,182 --> 00:20:01,261
So, whatever you think, comes into action
on this gross level,

192
00:20:01,462 --> 00:20:06,753
so Mr. Hitler was born and he made them
suffer.

193
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:18,285
And the stupidity of human beings
is responsible

194
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:23,481
for all the problems that are created
on this earth.

195
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,430
The other question was, “How the children
get leukemia?”

196
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:28,423
He would ask God, “How children get it?”

197
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:34,330
If the parents are so frantic and speedy,
children have to get it.

198
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:40,192
If you are not relaxed person when you
are married

199
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:44,020
and when you are going to have a baby,
you are thinking of divorces

200
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:48,271
and all sorts of nonsense, that franticness
will work on the child.

201
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:51,569
Psychologically it is a left-side problem,
and the child has to be

202
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:59,370
a patient of leukemia as soon as he is
born. That is what it is.

203
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:10,992
So the problems are created by human beings
because of their stupidity.

204
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,988
There is no problem that God has created
for you.

205
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,627
He’s solved all your problems. All your
problems He solves;

206
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:21,773
you have seen in Sahaj Yoga how He solves
your little, little problems even.

207
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:27,750
But we create problems for ourselves
by our stupidity,

208
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:38,039
by our addiction to elements, to material
things,

209
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:43,466
to material habits. Matter sits on our
head.

210
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:58,084
That is on the, we can say, on the level
of the earth element.

211
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:04,437
Then we have other problems like
emotional attachments:

212
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:07,992
“This is my daughter; this is my child;
this is my; this is mine;

213
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,867
I’m so attached to my child.”

214
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:19,349
Then, “This is my country. This is your
country.”

215
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,330
We create problem. This Falkland camp...
Falkland this thing

216
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:26,914
is an artificial problem, you can see
that.

217
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:30,147
I mean, when these people went there,
these Spaniards,

218
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,961
they all should be driven back to Spain.

219
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:37,902
And all from Brazil should be driven back
to Portugal.

220
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:42,510
What are they doing there if this is
the situation?

221
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,531
But they are all human beings! What is
this territory business?

222
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,161
So let human beings live happily wherever
they are.

223
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:53,053
What are they going to get out of this
territory?

224
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:57,558
God never created Argentina, Chile, England
and all that,

225
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:03,461
He created one homogeneous structure,
and it is to look after each other.

226
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:06,448
Like a heart is created, a liver is
created,

227
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:09,689
a brain is created, a nose is created.

228
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,758
If they start fighting - say this eye
starts fighting this eye.

229
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:20,324
We laugh, but we human beings do the same
thing.

230
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:23,616
We are all the time doing like this.

231
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:29,885
This is the stupidity of human beings,
which is creating problem.

232
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:33,071
And when you become very stupid,
somebody horrible

233
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:36,176
takes advantage of that and comes
on this earth

234
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:43,070
just like Hitler, and he tries to put you
right.

235
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:49,993
You don’t need all that. You need only
wisdom and your realisation.

236
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:54,025
And that is what is done today that you
have got realisation.

237
00:23:54,226 --> 00:24:00,870
So Easter for sahaj yogis all over
the world, is the most important happening,

238
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,878
because if it had not happened it would
not have been possible

239
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,395
to give realisation to people.

240
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,766
I think Gavin will read it out to you
later on

241
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:18,444
about what is written about Christ in Devi
Mahatmya.

242
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:23,331
This book was written about 14,000 years
back by Markandeya.

243
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:29,012
So imagine, 14,000 years back he knew,
being a seer, just like Blake,

244
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:33,825
what was going to happen when Christ
was to come.

245
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:36,638
But He was called as Mahavishnu. He was
not Vishnu,

246
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,025
He was the son of Vishnu.

247
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:51,234
And how many Christians understand about
Easter? They don’t.

248
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:54,612
They - it’s - Christianity today is nothing
but a mental activity,

249
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:57,255
that’s all, which is dead; nonsense it is.

250
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,821
Just like any other nonsensical religion,
it has become

251
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:04,340
another foolish, stupid religion, which has
no meaning.

252
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:08,361
Unless and until you get your realisation,
unless and until you feel the vibrations,

253
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:13,232
unless and until you feel this Divine
Surrounding Power, how will you understand?

254
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,409
Because that’s the only thing that is
truth;

255
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,380
that’s the only thing that is reality,

256
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:22,972
and unless and until you achieve it, how
will you know about Christ?

257
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:27,421
And fighting about Him; how can you fight?
I can’t understand really.

258
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:33,152
To me, it’s stupidity gone to another
extreme.

259
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:37,439
By this thing, what you do actually,
is to use

260
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,389
all these great incarnations to kill each
other. Can you imagine?

261
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,972
The things that came to elevate you,
to make you into higher living

262
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:50,742
are now used, the same things, the names
are used

263
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:53,679
to kill each other, to bring down each
other.

264
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,204
At the most, if you reach a point where
you don’t understand,

265
00:25:57,405 --> 00:26:01,122
then they start saying, “It’s a mystery.”

266
00:26:01,323 --> 00:26:04,563
What is the mystery? In Sahaj Yoga
there’s no mystery.

267
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:08,986
It’s all just there.

268
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:13,672
To me, human beings are a mystery.

269
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:18,704
I don’t understand them. I can’t
understand.

270
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:25,427
The resurrection of Christ has to now be
collective resurrection.

271
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:33,109
This is what is Maha Yoga. Has to be
the collective resurrection

272
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,589
and for this collective resurrection,

273
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:40,283
first of all sahaj yogis must decide to be
collective.

274
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:47,234
Because through Kundalini awakening,
you cross, no doubt, you cross through,

275
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:52,717
but you enter an area of collectivity.

276
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:58,453
And if you do not allow that collectivity
to permeate into you,

277
00:26:58,654 --> 00:27:01,178
then you come down.

278
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:07,082
Supposing you become a state beyond
the element,

279
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:10,641
the state where you are a collective being;

280
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,366
you are aware of the collective being;

281
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,924
you are aware that you are a part and
parcel of the whole;

282
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:21,654
you are aware that you have to help
your nose and your eyes

283
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:24,187
because you are part and parcel
of the whole.

284
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:27,112
You reach that stage where you understand
that,

285
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:32,216
“I am as important as other cells are, and
other cells are to be helped by me

286
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:36,613
and they have to sustain me, we are one.”
There should be complete concord.

287
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:42,587
This awareness comes after realisation,
and if you do not understand

288
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:47,419
that this awareness, that this collective
awareness

289
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,417
is the only way you can stay in that area.
Otherwise you get out.

290
00:27:53,618 --> 00:28:03,743
You start having your smaller wells and
you just go down into them.

291
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:09,481
The more you start to expand yourself,
you rise higher

292
00:28:09,698 --> 00:28:14,501
and then you are again with your badhas
or whatever it is.

293
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:19,150
But if you think that, “I have to live
for the whole.

294
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:26,181
I’m responsible for the whole. I’m
responsible for creating

295
00:28:26,577 --> 00:28:32,529
a nucleus of a cell which is going to look
after the whole,

296
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,557
and if I fall down the rest also suffers.

297
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:40,982
I have no business to fall down because
I have been resurrected to this point.

298
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:46,751
I have entered into the state of
collectivity, where my being,

299
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:50,300
which is the Spirit, is the collective
being

300
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:53,543
and I have to stay there, I have to be
there;

301
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:58,219
I cannot fall, it’s not the way I can
live.”

302
00:28:58,443 --> 00:29:03,522
But I have seen after realisation also,
people cannot get out of their shells.

303
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:08,758
They still remain in the shell. They cannot
spread their wings

304
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:16,531
and sing, and get out of their shell and
just fly.

305
00:29:16,732 --> 00:29:21,764
They cannot do it. They still stick on to
their small ways of life,

306
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:24,780
in a smaller ways, in every way.

307
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:29,590
In a holiday you go, you want to have
a separate holiday. Why?

308
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:33,200
This is the holiday time, holy-day as they
say.

309
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:38,132
Holy day. This is the holy-day. When you
are with other sahaja yogis

310
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:42,827
you are really enjoying the holiday. Where
do you enjoy a holiday otherwise?

311
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:48,623
Which is the other way? To be with them
is the real holiday.

312
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:54,953
And that is why one should understand that
you should expand your collectivity.

313
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:58,474
If you do not expand your collectivity
you are just a waste.

314
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:02,931
You are a wasteful creation of sahaj yogis,

315
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:06,918
which I’m sorry to say, will go down.

316
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,189
Such people show also, in the beginning,

317
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,691
gradually they start getting better and
better and better.

318
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:16,518
And once you are there in full state,
you really enjoy each

319
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:19,191
other’s company without having any fears
about them,

320
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,629
without having any possessiveness about
them,

321
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:28,446
without having any kind of expectation,
but just enjoying each other.

322
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,546
That has to happen. Like all our cells
in our body are like that.

323
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:42,381
If they can do it, why not we? Because
we have so much of sense;

324
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:46,241
at least we think we have more sense
than the cells have.

325
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:49,206
At least it is expected, because we have
evolved so much

326
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:52,019
from a unicell to this state.

327
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,603
And then you are the epitome of God’s
creation;

328
00:30:56,804 --> 00:31:00,249
you are the topmost people. Then why not?

329
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,547
When you are resurrected, the first thing
that should happen to you

330
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:07,304
is to understand that you are no more
an individual,

331
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:11,634
but you are a collective being. You are
no more an individual.

332
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:21,223
All things which make you circumcise
your individuality - throw that away.

333
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:25,240
You are no more an individual. All problems
which come to you

334
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:34,340
as individual problems are absolutely
useless, false, wasteful.

335
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:39,465
Think of the collective problems. I enjoy
such people.

336
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:44,964
Like the other day Fergie was anxious
to know about Bristol -

337
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:50,413
which points are there, which are giving
vibrations from the Mother Earth.

338
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:53,759
He’s worried about the whole of Bristol -
all the Jamaicans,

339
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,288
then about the whole Britain - British
people,

340
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:03,283
and then of the whole world you should be.
That’s what one should think.

341
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:06,731
One should not think, “How will my daughter
get married?

342
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:09,084
How can I get a ticket to go there?”

343
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:11,656
All these nonsensical ideas should be
given up

344
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:14,955
because you are now entered into
the Kingdom of God

345
00:32:15,156 --> 00:32:18,222
and He is going to look after you.

346
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:23,170
Because that state you establish within
yourself that you are a collective being.

347
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:26,927
All other things will drop out. Gradually
everybody will be molded.

348
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:32,067
Even the most difficult I have seen,
have improved.

349
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:35,469
But what about you, the one who is
improving everybody else,

350
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,472
what about you? How far you are there?

351
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:41,714
How far in your faith that you know that,

352
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:44,995
“I have entered into the Kingdom of God

353
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:49,798
and that every action mine is looked
after and guided

354
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,556
by His power and I’m aware of it.

355
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:56,587
I’m aware that I have entered into
the Kingdom of God

356
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:59,624
which is expressed through my
collectivity.”

357
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:04,938
So collectivity is the nature
of a sahaj yogi.

358
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:09,068
And that’s what one has to realise.

359
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,297
May God bless you all.

360
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:17,477
Is it all right now? Just time.

361
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:25,881
How I manage it, without looking
at the watch?

362
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:02,920
Come forward. There’s some people standing.

363
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:07,766
Come forward. I’ll have some water.

364
00:34:08,227 --> 00:34:11,191
First some tea.

365
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:37,973
I mean, all these lectures if you could
tape [Hallo, Athena, hallo!] –

366
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:44,086
if you could tape all these and sort of
send some of them to France and –

367
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:48,356
or from Lille they have come both of them –

368
00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:55,283
and I think it should work out.

369
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:58,770
Because first the people come in, then
they disappear.

370
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:05,002
As usual, that’s the common feature,
you see. Then gradually they…

371
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:09,054
Yogi: Mother?
Shri Mataji: It’s lovely.

372
00:35:09,255 --> 00:35:11,899
Yogi: If someone makes a list of Your
lectures,

373
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,049
what You’ve been speaking about, as it
was along which we got one,

374
00:35:16,272 --> 00:35:18,679
we can print a list each month
on a newsletter,

375
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,333
so the people in other centres can write
and ask for tapes in writing,

376
00:35:21,534 --> 00:35:23,529
ask which wants…
Shri Mataji: That’s a good thing.

377
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,022
You must every time I speak you will give
it a heading.

378
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:32,637
All that we should. What is it?

379
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:34,698
Is it coming?
Yogi: The radio programme.

380
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:38,260
Shri Mataji: Ah, is it coming?

381
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:43,344
It’s still time.

382
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:47,572
Yes, that is important. I agree

383
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:52,565
that we must have a list of things where…

384
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:55,267
You have to give it a title - you see,
I have no titles,

385
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:59,406
but you have to give a title. For example
what you can say

386
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:07,483
is the Resurrection of Christ, or something
about Easter.

387
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,410
Actually you can contact this Bishop
of Canterbury.

388
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:27,457
This - you know... Poor man, he is not such
a staunch Christian, I feel, the way…

389
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,353
I think next time you may write a letter
to him,

390
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:35,341
and some of you can go and see him.

391
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:38,617
And Gregoire comes, and three-four people
you should ask for a thing.

392
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:42,828
And you should say - today’s, can you get
today’s Times?

393
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:45,067
Or if you can telephone to my servant,

394
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:49,432
tell him not to throw today’s newspaper,
he’s a good thrower

395
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:52,328
Very good at throwing. Can somebody
telephone to him?

396
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:57,673
Is a phone here available? John?

397
00:36:57,873 --> 00:37:01,711
Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral
of Saint-Albans. Shri Mataji: Eh?

398
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:04,624
Yogi: He used to be in the cathedral
of Saint-Albans. You know?

399
00:37:04,825 --> 00:37:07,740
He was there when You were there.
Gavin: When You were in St. Albans,

400
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:10,807
when Djamel was living at St. Alban,
You visited there,

401
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:13,382
he was the bishop there. That time.
Yogi: He was the bishop there.

402
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:16,695
Shri Mataji: How was he?
Yogi: I didn’t know him at that time,

403
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:20,573
but soon after You visited, he got
promoted.

404
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:24,776
Shri Mataji: Really? Good idea!

405
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:29,659
So we can write to him. [Yogi: Yes] I might
have met him there also, possibly.

406
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:35,090
Might have seen him.
[Yogi: “It’s quite possible, yes”]

407
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:12,982
Gavin, you have to collect my passport
tomorrow. All right?

408
00:38:13,183 --> 00:38:18,695
Then I would say, on 5th of May,

409
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,965
if you people could collect some money
for this building.

410
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:27,863
That’s a good day, when you can give it
to me, or to Gregoire [Yogi: Yes],

411
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:32,227
and we can put that money in the bank,
we have opened now an account for that.

412
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:36,368
Any amount that people want to give,
and the first amount –

413
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,264
and also Lille people wanted to give
some money.

414
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:43,795
I told them that’s for our, you should
give it for our building account,

415
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:48,322
because we have to have a building now,
it’s absolutely eminent.

416
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:52,350
Before I go back, you could have money

417
00:38:52,551 --> 00:39:01,091
for which you can also tell Warren

418
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,957
that this is what is decided.

419
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:09,503
Then the first amount should go on the 5th,
would be a good idea.

420
00:39:09,704 --> 00:39:15,651
And I’ve got the account number also,
so you can send it

421
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:20,377
in the name of Gregoire, and the account
number I’ll give it to you.

422
00:39:20,578 --> 00:39:26,562
If you want, it should be all right.

423
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:31,104
Gavin: May I ask You to find out how many
people are about to go to Paris from here?

424
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:35,511
Shri Mataji: Now. Now, for Paris, the thing
is, it is on Tuesday,

425
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:38,991
the programme is on Tuesday.

426
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:46,119
And she has arranged that we go to Lille
on Sunday.

427
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,551
So if you come to Lille on Sunday,

428
00:39:51,761 --> 00:40:00,426
after the programme, if you want, you all
can go to Paris,

429
00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:08,126
and stay in the ashram there. Or is it
possible in Lille?

430
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:13,824
Is there any place where we can take it
on rent for a night somewhere?

431
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,442
Yogi: No problem, Mother.
Shri Mataji: What is it?

432
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:19,170
Yogi: No problem.
Shri Mataji: No problem? Sure?

433
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:22,358
Yogi: There’s definitely place.

434
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:26,670
Shri Mataji: All right, so one night you
can stay in Lille. Will be good idea.

435
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,947
Yogi: If there are enough people we could
also take a bus. Shri Mataji: Hm?

436
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:32,340
Yogi: We could take a bus to travel.
Shri Mataji: Good.

437
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:36,893
Yogi: If there are enough people, we just
have to find out how many want to get there.

438
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:41,009
Shri Mataji: Now, from Lille then we go
to Paris.

439
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,560
In Paris you have a big place to the…

440
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,541
that will be the Monday, Tuesday,

441
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:58,813
and Wednesday we have this Puja,
in the morning time perhaps,

442
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,579
and I would like to come back if possible
on the 6th.

443
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,943
If 5th is all right, all right, otherwise
6th you can put it.

444
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,751
Somebody is working it out in Brussels!

445
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:23,153
Did you write to that doctor? [Yogi:
“Yes, Mother…”] Good.

446
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:26,762
Have you kept his address? [Yogi: Yes…]

447
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:34,484
I think on Gavin I put too much pressure
also sometimes.

448
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:39,560
Somebody must try to share that also.
And you should find out.

449
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:44,280
It’s easy to telephone to him, I know his
number very well.

450
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:47,833
But you can find out, all of you, if he
needs any help.

451
00:41:48,034 --> 00:41:51,328
Magda, sometimes you can telephone
to him [Magda: “Yes, Shri Mataji”],

452
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:55,497
and find out if he needs any help, for
writing some letters or something,

453
00:41:55,698 --> 00:41:59,202
and also for typing anything –

454
00:41:59,403 --> 00:42:03,121
anybody who wants to help him, you see,
it’s essential,

455
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:07,689
because I trouble him quite a lot.

456
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:13,439
And also you have a little account for
sending letters and things,

457
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,842
and for telephones, a little account can
be made. Everybody should -

458
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:25,416
now, because we are expanding, we have
to have a proper system

459
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:30,773
by which we work it out. So many letters
come to me every day,

460
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:34,969
and I’m so lazy, I just can’t… I don’t
know.

461
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,203
I think if I write now, then another will
come tomorrow, so I wait for a while.

462
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:44,474
Then I - but my attention is there. If you
write to me,

463
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:47,118
I’m very happy because I know what is
happening.

464
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:51,405
But don’t write very long letters, you
know.

465
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:57,455
I like, I enjoy them, but if they are too
long,

466
00:42:57,656 --> 00:43:00,383
then, you know, the main thing is left out.

467
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:08,554
We have to be to the point and properly
with the protocol and all that.

468
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:13,742
There’s one gentleman who writes to me
regularly from India.

469
00:43:13,943 --> 00:43:16,743
His name is Mr. Brahme, Mr. Brahme.

470
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:24,113
And he writes only two sentences:
one is that, “Mother,

471
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:29,900
please bless me that I will be a good
sahaja yogi”,

472
00:43:30,101 --> 00:43:34,998
“Mother, please bless the whole world
that they become sahaja yogis,

473
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,712
and the Sahaja Yoga spreads,

474
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:45,072
and your most loving son at Your Lotus
Feet, so and so.” That’s all.

475
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:54,759
Every - regularly, I must have so many
letters from him, that’s all.

476
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:59,875
It’s good after all: whenever you write
praise and all that it’s good.

477
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:05,546
But sometimes you know, we go on writing –

478
00:44:05,747 --> 00:44:12,371
like one gentleman has written, “I’ve been
working for two years,

479
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:19,145
I’ve done everything, I’ve done nimbu,
I’ve done this,

480
00:44:19,346 --> 00:44:23,453
I’ve done this, I’ve done that and I’ve not
felt the vibrations”, you see.

481
00:44:23,656 --> 00:44:28,610
But the list of things he gave, you see,
made me laugh really:

482
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:33,378
“Oh My, you must be fed up!”

483
00:44:34,364 --> 00:44:38,035
And the simple thing he is doing wrong,
which people didn’t understand

484
00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:40,759
that is he is doing Gayatri mantra.

485
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,345
If you do Gayatri mantra, it doesn’t
work out.

486
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:51,141
I mean, this is so common, I mean, while
we are here,

487
00:44:51,342 --> 00:44:57,679
Gayatri mantra if people have done,
their right side is so much horrible,

488
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,724
and it doesn’t work out at all. So you have
to neutralise it with Lord’s Prayer,

489
00:45:03,925 --> 00:45:06,765
and with forgiveness to others,

490
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:13,727
with the right hand towards the photograph
and left hand outside.

491
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:18,964
And never to say Gayatri mantra again,
you see? But that’s what it is.

492
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:25,208
But these small, small things people don’t
notice when I’m treating others.

493
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:29,762
And I don’t know how to talk about it,
one by one,

494
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:33,123
because when it comes before me, I know
the solution.

495
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:37,222
So it’s better that you people note it down
what Mother does at that time.

496
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:45,943
Now this Gayatri mantra is one of the worst
curses on human beings, I think.

497
00:45:46,145 --> 00:45:49,471
It is so right-sided.

498
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:52,756
An Indian, if he does Gayatri mantra,

499
00:45:52,957 --> 00:46:03,055
he becomes ten times worse that any
westerner. Think of it.

500
00:46:03,256 --> 00:46:06,731
Now, can you read it? Now is it started?

501
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:12,095
Yogis: Somebody has to set the frequency…
The right frequency for …

502
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:25,667
Shri Mataji: Why not start the radio?
Yogi: I think everything’s on.

503
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:31,521
Shri Mataji: Is there no radio there?
(Yogi: “Yes, Mother.”) What’s happening?

504
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:44,162
Shri Mataji: Loudly, I can’t hear.

505
00:46:47,352 --> 00:46:51,568
Yogi: It begins after five, Mother.

506
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,542
Shri Mataji: Is it?

507
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:23,276
More loudly.

508
00:48:16,612 --> 00:48:22,140
Is it yours? [Yogi: “No, Mother… it’s
a hour-long programme, Mother...”]

509
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:25,623
[Yogi: “You see, we didn’t take all
of it…”] All right, all right.

510
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:37,458
That’s better.

511
00:48:40,663 --> 00:48:46,069
You have to go through all nonsense
to listen to some sense of that.

512
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,751
Gavin, what have you got? You read
the Bible, I think?

513
00:48:54,951 --> 00:48:59,602
Gavin: Yes. It’s a very appropriate psalm
we’ve discovered, Mother, very short…

514
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,403
Shri Mataji: Must be, must be. Gavin: ...
for the ashrams. Shri Mataji: Eh?

515
00:49:02,604 --> 00:49:06,918
Gavin: It’s for the ashrams.
Shri Mataji: Lovely.

516
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:13,007
Gavin: “Psalm 133.

517
00:49:13,294 --> 00:49:16,025
(1) Behold, how good and how pleasant it is

518
00:49:16,234 --> 00:49:20,584
for brethren to dwell together in unity!

519
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:24,089
(2) It is like the precious ointment upon
the head,

520
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,672
that ran down upon the beard, even
Aaron’s beard:

521
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:32,834
that went down to the skirts of his
garments;

522
00:49:33,037 --> 00:49:39,874
(3) As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
that descended upon the mountains of Zion:

523
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:46,581
for there the Lord commanded the blessing,
even life for evermore”.

524
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:54,032
Shri Mataji: See? Very beautiful you found
out, I must say.

525
00:50:01,937 --> 00:50:06,283
Now what is it? Devi Mahatmya you read
it out.

526
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:11,277
[“SRIMAD DEVI BHAGAVATAM,”
BOOK 9, CHAPTER 3]

527
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:17,241
Gavin: “Narayana said:– ‘O Devarshi!
The egg (born of Mula Prakriti)

528
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:22,960
that was floating in the waters for a
period equal to the life period of Brahma,

529
00:50:23,168 --> 00:50:28,330
now in the fullness of time separated
into two parts.

530
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:31,715
Within that egg there was a powerful child,

531
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:38,207
lustrous like one thousand millions
of suns.” Shri Mataji: Suns. See.

532
00:50:38,408 --> 00:50:44,739
Gavin: “This child could not suck Mother’s
milk as it was forsaken by Her.

533
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:50,403
So, being tired of hunger, the child, for
a moment, cried repeatedly”.

534
00:50:50,604 --> 00:50:54,240
Shri Mataji: Forsaken because He had
to grow!

535
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:58,959
Gavin: “The child that will become the lord
of countless Brahmandas (universes) -”

536
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,757
Shri Mataji: Countless Brahmandas.
Brahmandas are universes.

537
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,792
Gavin: “…now an orphan having no father
nor mother

538
00:51:05,993 --> 00:51:10,271
began to look upwards from the waters.

539
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:15,278
This boy came to be denominated afterwards
by the name of Maha Virat

540
00:51:15,479 --> 00:51:19,522
when He became gross and grosser.

541
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:27,461
As there is nothing finer than radium, so
there is nothing grosser than Maha Virat.

542
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:31,637
The power of this Maha Virat, one-sixteenth
of that of Shri Krishna,

543
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:38,362
the Highest Self. But this boy…”
Shri Mataji: That is Yehova.

544
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:43,287
Gavin: “…But this boy, (born of
the Prakruti Radha),

545
00:51:43,488 --> 00:51:49,084
is the Sole Stay of all this Universe”…
Shri Mataji: Sole Stay.

546
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:54,153
Gavin: “… He is denominated by the name
Maha Vishnu.

547
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:59,008
In his every pore countless universes
are existing.

548
00:51:59,209 --> 00:52:04,132
So much so that even Shri Krishna could
not count them.

549
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:08,074
If it were possible to count the number
of dust particles,

550
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:12,825
it is impossible to count the number
of the universes.

551
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:17,536
So there are endless Brahmas, Vishnus,
and Maheshwaras.

552
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:22,857
In every Brahmanda, there is Brahma,
Vishnu, and Mahesha.

553
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:28,873
Each Brahmanda extends from Patala
to the Brahmaloka.

554
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:32,210
The abode of Vaikuntha is higher than that

555
00:52:32,411 --> 00:52:38,035
(that is, it is situated outside
of Brahmanda),

556
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,181
again the abode of Goloka is fifty koti
yojanas

557
00:52:42,382 --> 00:52:48,328
(that is 50 x 10 x 4 x 2 million miles)
higher than Vaikuntha.

558
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:56,742
This Goloka Dhama is eternal and real
as Shri Krishna is eternal and real.

559
00:52:56,943 --> 00:53:02,382
This world composed of seven islands
is surrounded by the seven oceans.

560
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:08,190
Forty-nine Upa Dvipas (smaller islands
adjacent to them) exist here.

561
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:12,757
Besides there are countless mountains
and forests.

562
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:16,523
Higher than this earth is the Brahmaloka
with seven heavens,

563
00:53:16,724 --> 00:53:19,844
and below this, are the seven Patalas.

564
00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:23,928
This is the bounding limit of Brahmanda.

565
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:26,884
Just above this earth there is
the Bhurloka,

566
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:31,190
above is Bhuvaloka, then Swahaloka,
then Janahloka,

567
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:34,463
then Tapahloka, then Satyaloka, and
above that …”

568
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:39,361
Shri Mataji: Mahaloka. Mahaloka not there?
Maha. Gavin: Brahmaloka.

569
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:43,103
Shri Mataji: Bhur, Bhuvah, Swaha.
They call it Brahma.

570
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:45,439
Gavin: Bhur, Bhuva, Swaha.
Shri Mataji: Swaha, Tapah.

571
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,360
Gavin: Janah.
Shri Mataji: Janah. Tapah.

572
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:51,200
Gavin: Satya and Brahmaloka.

573
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:55,540
“The splendor of Brahmaloka is like that
of molten gold.

574
00:53:55,741 --> 00:54:01,661
But all the substances whether outside
or inside this Brahmaloka, are transient.

575
00:54:01,862 --> 00:54:06,541
When this Brahmanda dissolves, everything
dissolves and is destroyed.

576
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:10,124
All are temporary like bubbles of water.

577
00:54:10,325 --> 00:54:15,264
Only Goloka and Vaikuntha are eternal.

578
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:20,328
In every pore of this Maha Virat is
existing one Brahmanda.

579
00:54:20,547 --> 00:54:23,663
What to speak about…”. Shri Mataji: Hm.
Pore means any – every –

580
00:54:23,864 --> 00:54:27,477
what you call this, pore of the skin.

581
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:34,189
One Brahmanda exists in Christ.
[Aside] Thank you.

582
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,836
Gavin: “What to speak of others when
even Krishna cannot count

583
00:54:37,037 --> 00:54:39,764
the number of these Brahmandas.

584
00:54:39,972 --> 00:54:44,252
In every Brahmanda there is Brahma,
Vishnu and Mahesha.

585
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:46,660
O Child Narada! In every Brahmanda,

586
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:52,031
the number of the gods is three kotis
or 30 millions.

587
00:54:52,232 --> 00:54:55,368
Some of them are the Dikpatis (the Regents
of the quarters);

588
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:58,687
some are the Dikpalas (the Rulers
of the quarters),

589
00:54:58,888 --> 00:55:02,104
some are asterisms, and some are planets.

590
00:55:02,305 --> 00:55:06,950
In the Bhurloka, there are four Varnas
(Brahmins, etc.,)

591
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:10,589
and in the Patalas there are Nagas.

592
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:15,659
Thus the Universe exists composed
of moveable and non-moveable things.

593
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,248
(This is Brahmanda Vivriti).

594
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,230
O Nârada! Now the Virat Purusha

595
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:25,590
began to look up to the skies again
and again

596
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:31,078
but He could not see anything within
that egg except the void.

597
00:55:31,279 --> 00:55:37,180
Then distressed with hunger He cried out
repeatedly and became merged in anxiety.

598
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,994
Next moment getting back His consciousness,

599
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:43,894
He began to think of Krishna, the Highest
Person

600
00:55:44,095 --> 00:55:48,311
and saw there at once the eternal light
of Brahma.

601
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:52,460
He saw there His form as deep blue like
new rain-cloud;

602
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:56,155
with two bands [Original text reads
“hands”], garment of a yellow color,

603
00:55:56,356 --> 00:56:00,554
sweet smile on His face, flute in His hand

604
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:06,259
and He seemed to be very anxious to show
His Grace to Devotees.

605
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,737
Looking at the Lord, His Father, the boy
became glad and smiled.

606
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:16,609
The Lord, the bestower of boon, granted
Him boons appropriate for that moment.

607
00:56:16,813 --> 00:56:20,171
Oh child, let you possess knowledge
like me,

608
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:23,277
let your hunger and thirst vanish:
let you ...”

609
00:56:23,478 --> 00:56:28,171
Shri Mataji: See. Hunger and thirst vanish.
He fasted for forty days.

610
00:56:28,372 --> 00:56:31,716
See, all the indications are there.

611
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:34,610
Gavin: “…let you be the holder
of innumerable Brahmandas

612
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:39,557
till the time of Pralaya (the universal
dissolution).

613
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:42,671
Be without any selfishness,

614
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:47,063
be fearless and the bestower of boons
to all.

615
00:56:47,264 --> 00:56:52,674
Let not old age, death, disease, sorrow
or any other ailings afflict thee.”

616
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:57,407
Shri Mataji: This is a sign of a Brahma
Shakti.

617
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:03,125
He Himself has said before that the Brahma
Shakti, or the Spirit

618
00:57:03,326 --> 00:57:09,656
does not die, does not get old and all
that, and He is telling him all that.

619
00:57:10,787 --> 00:57:15,674
Gavin: “Thus saying, He repeated thrice
on his ear the six-lettered great Mantra

620
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:21,621
“Om Krishnaya Swaha” worshipped by
the Vedas with their Amgas,

621
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:27,146
the Giver of desires and the destroyer
of all troubles and calamities.

622
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:29,879
O Brahma’s Son! Thus giving the mantra,

623
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:34,108
Shri Krishna arranged for His feeding thus.

624
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:38,867
In every universe whatever offerings will
be given to Shri Krishna,

625
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:43,967
one sixteenth of that will go to Narayana,
the Lord of Vaikuntha,

626
00:57:44,168 --> 00:57:49,670
and fifteen sixteenth is to go to this boy
the Virat. Shri Krishna…”

627
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:52,681
Shri Mataji: He is Narayana also,
Shri Krishna is Narayana, you see.

628
00:57:52,882 --> 00:57:59,103
So one sixteenth will go to Narayana
and fifteen sixteenth to His son.

629
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:03,013
Gavin: “Shri Krishna did not allot any
share for Himself.

630
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:09,291
Himself transcending all the Gunas, full,
He is always satisfied with Himself.

631
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:13,085
What necessity is there for any further
offerings?

632
00:58:13,286 --> 00:58:15,932
Whatever the people offer with devotion,

633
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:20,687
the Lord of Lakshmi, the Virat eats
all these.

634
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:25,723
Bhagavan Shri Krishna giving thus to
the Virat the boon and the mantra,

635
00:58:25,924 --> 00:58:32,122
said, “Oh child, say what more you desire.
I will give you that instantly.”

636
00:58:32,416 --> 00:58:36,775
The Virat boy hearing thus the words
of Shri Krishna spoke.

637
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:41,417
“O, Thou Omnipresent, I have got no
desires whatsoever,

638
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:46,692
save this that as long as I live, whether
for a short time or for a long time,

639
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,189
me have pure bhakti towards Thy Lotus
Feet.”

640
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:54,558
Shri Mataji: That’s why always Christ has
these fingers like this,

641
00:58:54,759 --> 00:59:01,088
one denoting towards Shri Krishna and
another towards Vishnu.

642
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,998
He’s talked of His Father throughout.

643
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,743
“For a short time or for a long time”:

644
00:59:10,943 --> 00:59:15,714
He lived for a short time and for a long
time.

645
00:59:21,468 --> 00:59:25,358
Gavin: “‘In this world he is Jivanmukta
(liberated whilst living)

646
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,646
who is your Bhakta; and that bewildered
fool is dead while living

647
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:33,559
who is devoid of any Bhakti to Thee.

648
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,139
What needs he to perform Japam, asceticism,

649
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:41,527
sacrifice, worship, holding fasts and
observances,

650
00:59:41,728 --> 00:59:46,120
going to sacred places of pilgrimages
and other virtuous acts

651
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,678
if he be without any bhakti to
Shri Krishna?

652
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:53,484
Vain is his life who is devoid of any
devotion to Shri Krishna,

653
00:59:53,685 --> 00:59:57,179
under Whose Grace he has obtained his life

654
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:01,207
and Whom he does not now pay homage
and worship.

655
01:00:01,408 --> 01:00:07,030
He is endowed with Shakti as long as Atma
resides in his body;

656
01:00:07,231 --> 01:00:11,924
no sooner the Atma departs from his body
all the Shaktis accompany him.

657
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:17,602
O Great One! And Thou art the Universal
Atman who transcends Prakriti,

658
01:00:17,803 --> 01:00:20,942
Who is All will, the Primeval Person -‘”
Shri Mataji: See?

659
01:00:21,143 --> 01:00:25,397
Gavin: “…and of the nature of the Highest
Light.

660
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:30,039
O Child!” Thus saying, the Virat boy
remained silent.

661
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,210
Shri Krishna then spoke in sweet words,

662
01:00:34,411 --> 01:00:38,985
“Oh child, let you remain as fresh as ever
like Me.

663
01:00:39,186 --> 01:00:45,634
You will not have any fall even if
innumerable Brahmas pass away.

664
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:51,141
Let you divide yourself in parts and turn
into smaller Virats in every universe.”

665
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:53,214
Shri Mataji: That’s what He did.

666
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:57,507
Gavin: “Brahma will spring from Your navel
and will create the cosmos.

667
01:00:57,708 --> 01:01:01,328
From the forehead of that Brahma will
spring eleven Rudras

668
01:01:01,528 --> 01:01:04,854
for the destruction of the creation.”
Shri Mataji: See.

669
01:01:05,055 --> 01:01:07,702
Gavin: “But they will all be parts
of Shiva.”

670
01:01:07,903 --> 01:01:11,087
Shri Mataji: That is given by Shiva to Him.

671
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:17,376
You see, the eleven parts are given to this
child by Shiva.

672
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:22,120
Gavin: “The Rudra named Kalagni, of these
eleven Rudras,

673
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:27,290
will be the destroyer of all this Vishvas
(the cosmos).

674
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:31,414
Besides, from each of your sub-divisions,
the Vishnu will originate

675
01:01:31,615 --> 01:01:37,157
and that Bhagavan Vishnu will be
the Preserver of this Vishvu world.

676
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,908
I say that under My favour you will always
be full of bhakti towards Me

677
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:48,360
and no sooner you meditate on Me, you
will be able to see My lovely form.

678
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:53,294
There is no doubt in this; and your
Mother, Who resides in My breast,

679
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:56,878
will not be difficult for you to see.”

680
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:00,666
Shri Mataji: Better to see. Gavin: “Let
you remain here in ease and comfort.

681
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:09,164
I now go to Goloka.” Saying thus Shri
Krishna, the Lord of world, disappears.

682
01:02:10,109 --> 01:02:15,686
Shri Mataji: See, it’s so clear cut. Better
send it to this Archbishop of Canterbury.

683
01:02:15,913 --> 01:02:19,311
What does he understand about Christ?

684
01:02:19,514 --> 01:02:25,162
That every pore of His skin is one
Brahmanda.

685
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:28,715
So He became very gross, you see,

686
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:32,303
in the sense that He came down
on this earth, you see,

687
01:02:32,504 --> 01:02:35,734
and then He became the Spirit.

688
01:02:37,576 --> 01:02:41,408
That’s why it is said, His “only Son.”

689
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,941
Yogi: Mother?

690
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,127
Shri Mataji: What is happening?

691
01:03:03,398 --> 01:03:05,948
Nothing?

692
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,606
Yogi: Mother, may I read something for You?
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

693
01:03:12,147 --> 01:03:14,872
Yogi: Paul, Paul Duncan and I have written
this. Shri Mataji: Eh?

694
01:03:15,073 --> 01:03:16,957
Yogi: Paul Duncan and I have written this
for You.

695
01:03:17,158 --> 01:03:20,294
It’s called “Resurrection Sunday.”

696
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:23,260
“We wandered lost in this confused age /

697
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:26,734
You came to us like rain to a scorched
plain /

698
01:03:26,935 --> 01:03:29,070
We made so many foolish mistakes /

699
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:32,120
But You laughed and loved us even more. /

700
01:03:32,321 --> 01:03:36,680
We walked always seeking Messiah’s return /

701
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,175
And then You came with open arms. /

702
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:42,019
We closed our hearts and ran our love dry /

703
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,134
And You refreshed us with cooling Grace. /

704
01:03:45,335 --> 01:03:47,534
Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

705
01:03:47,735 --> 01:03:49,621
You wash our troubles away. /

706
01:03:49,823 --> 01:03:52,339
Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

707
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,866
You are opening our flowers. /

708
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:58,664
We struggled hard inside our shells /

709
01:03:58,865 --> 01:04:02,270
You took the eggs and made the doves. /

710
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,941
We cried for love and forgot how to be /

711
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:09,239
You wiped our tears and make us see. /

712
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,155
We needed the fulfillment of Christ’s
words /

713
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:16,054
And then Mother Mary, You gave us
true second birth. /

714
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:18,986
We languished in our man-made tombs /

715
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:22,674
Divine Redeemer, You rolled away
the stone. /

716
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,072
Mother, O Mother, River of Love /

717
01:04:25,307 --> 01:04:27,313
You wash all troubles away. /

718
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:29,394
Mother, O Mother, Ocean of Joy /

719
01:04:29,613 --> 01:04:33,114
You open all the flowers.”

720
01:04:36,203 --> 01:04:39,592
Shri Mataji: So beautiful, I think.
Very beautiful.

721
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:44,817
It’s like a mantra working on my
vibrations.

722
01:04:54,405 --> 01:04:57,322
So now all our programmes are fixed
for different days,

723
01:04:57,523 --> 01:05:04,698
and now I have received a letter from –
again from him, Jim,

724
01:05:04,899 --> 01:05:10,031
saying that he would like to have
a programme from the 15th of June now.

725
01:05:10,235 --> 01:05:17,913
And I personally think that he has put
last two days –

726
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:25,945
one day to Norwich, and then one day
in Cambridge, then Norwich,

727
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:36,033
I think 17th is Cambridge, 18th Norwich
and again Cambridge, and then Puja.

728
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:40,214
Best is to keep two days in Cambridge –
first Norwich,

729
01:05:40,415 --> 01:05:43,593
that will be - what date did I tell you
to have Norwich?

730
01:05:43,794 --> 01:05:46,381
Yogi: The 18th, Jai Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: 18th should be Norwich,

731
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:54,101
19th and 20th Cambridge, and 21st will
be the Puja. All right?

732
01:05:54,302 --> 01:05:58,697
Just change that much, otherwise it’s
perfectly alright.

733
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:07,625
What else? Kevin, how are you?

734
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:10,740
Yogi: Sorry, Shri Mataji…
Shri Mataji: Hot? Very hot?

735
01:06:10,941 --> 01:06:16,158
Yogi: No, I was late, I didn’t have time
to change my clothes.

736
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:19,131
Shri Mataji: You are all right!

737
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:26,175
You are all right.

738
01:06:26,386 --> 01:06:31,601
You see, when the Mother has seen you
in your “birthday suits”

739
01:06:31,802 --> 01:06:38,274
why should you worry about any dress
with your Mother, isn’t it?

740
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:45,365
There is no formality with the Mother.

741
01:06:45,565 --> 01:06:47,646
It’s all right, She likes to see you
properly clad,

742
01:06:47,846 --> 01:06:51,811
but there’s nothing, no formality.

743
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:55,645
[Aside, to somebody:] Thank you, that’s
all, thank you very much.

744
01:06:56,154 --> 01:06:58,205
[To the yogi] But you look serious, that’s
what I want to know.

745
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:02,488
Yogi: Oh, I’m worried whether the Divine
is coming through on the tape.

746
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:04,550
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.
Yogi: Because I don’t know!

747
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:09,200
Shri Mataji: Yes, I was wondering what’s
the matter, why are you so serious –

748
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:14,380
no, I just thought, maybe because now
you are married

749
01:07:14,581 --> 01:07:19,226
and you are thinking of a married life now,

750
01:07:20,274 --> 01:07:26,045
what to do, and - No? No problems?
Yogi: No, no.

751
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:29,997
Shri Mataji: You see, when you even tell
somebody, “You have to get married”,

752
01:07:30,198 --> 01:07:36,448
suddenly they … as if somebody has stuck
a pistol!

753
01:07:36,649 --> 01:07:41,850
That’s the first reaction I have seen
many-a-times.

754
01:07:42,051 --> 01:07:45,506
Pat has not come today? Yogini: No, Grazyna
is not very well, Mother.

755
01:07:45,707 --> 01:07:48,914
Shri Mataji: Hmm?
Yogini: Grazyna is still not very well...

756
01:07:49,115 --> 01:07:50,943
Shri Mataji: I know, poor thing.

757
01:07:51,143 --> 01:07:56,073
Yogini: They’d like to come and see You
next week…

758
01:07:56,542 --> 01:08:00,343
Shri Mataji: I have told - her problem
is basically something different,

759
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:04,622
and I have told the solution and I’ve asked
Gavin, Gavin to find out.

760
01:08:04,823 --> 01:08:07,848
Did you ask Sarah?
Gavin: I didn’t get the chance just yet.

761
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:12,145
Shri Mataji: But Sarah is here, you can
talk to her.

762
01:08:12,346 --> 01:08:18,383
You see, we have a, we had a doctor
in India called Dr. Shirolkar,

763
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:21,007
and he devised an operation – you might
have heard his name

764
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:22,706
[Yogini comments probably on name,
Shri Mataji: “Ah”] –

765
01:08:22,907 --> 01:08:27,981
to strengthen the … - Who is crying
so much?

766
01:08:28,181 --> 01:08:30,283
Just see the child -

767
01:08:30,502 --> 01:08:35,728
the lower wall, the lower wall of
the uterus, you see?

768
01:08:35,929 --> 01:08:39,167
And that operation somebody must be
doing here also, I’m sure.

769
01:08:39,368 --> 01:08:43,298
Yogini: Yes, she had it. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogini: She had it done.

770
01:08:43,561 --> 01:08:47,984
Shri Mataji: She had that operation?
Yogini: She did, but it’s still… she still…

771
01:08:48,192 --> 01:08:51,006
Shri Mataji: No, but then she conceived
very early then. [Yogini: “Sorry?”]

772
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:55,406
You have to wait after that to develop
into a proper…

773
01:08:55,607 --> 01:09:00,085
she had that kind of an operation, did she?
Yogini: I think she did it, yes.

774
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:04,211
Shri Mataji: Then she should have waited
to see that the wall is fully developed,

775
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:11,177
I think if she had allowed to - I’m going
to work out something else for her.

776
01:09:12,872 --> 01:09:18,794
You can have another layer just to make it
strong, you see? [Yogini: “Yes.”]

777
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:31,301
Any other problems?

778
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:43,565
[To a yogini] How are you now? Gail?
All right?

779
01:09:47,424 --> 01:09:49,325
Don’t do any heavy work, but walking
is good.

780
01:09:49,526 --> 01:09:52,694
In Regent Park, you can go in the morning
for a walk, not in (unclear word)

781
01:09:52,895 --> 01:09:56,572
but it’s a good place to walk about
little bit.

782
01:09:56,773 --> 01:09:59,180
[To another yogini] How are you? Why don’t
you sit on a chair,

783
01:09:59,381 --> 01:10:03,812
will be better, better. Better sit down
on a chair.

784
01:10:04,013 --> 01:10:08,942
Go. Go there, to sit down.

785
01:10:11,205 --> 01:10:14,494
So how are you? [Yogini: “I’m all right…” ]
Good.

786
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:20,891
I’m happy you could come. I’m happy
you could come.

787
01:10:27,034 --> 01:10:31,257
Received any letter? He is telephoning me,

788
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:36,510
he is telling me that he is trying to get
the permission and this and that,

789
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:39,872
he’s going to write to me again. His style
is like this.

790
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:48,215
You see, he doesn’t want to talk about it
unless he really gets the permission.

791
01:10:48,557 --> 01:10:52,140
Yogini: I wrote to him.
Shri Mataji: You've written to him, yes.

792
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:55,589
He telephones to me.

793
01:11:02,311 --> 01:11:07,851
All suspiciousness, you see, because he is
in the Air Force,

794
01:11:08,052 --> 01:11:11,259
and the government is suspicious
of foreigners, you see,

795
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:16,966
marrying any Air Force this thing, you see.

796
01:11:18,586 --> 01:11:21,870
I just don’t understand.

797
01:11:22,807 --> 01:11:25,579
So I would say take my passport, you have
to walk like a criminal

798
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,865
with your passport number, this, that,

799
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:32,771
and you have to get my visas in Rome
and these places.

800
01:11:32,972 --> 01:11:36,711
But I think he can do it, Dinesh knows
how to do it.

801
01:11:36,912 --> 01:11:38,973
Tell him to go to Varad, Varad Rajan,

802
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:43,321
he’ll give him, because is a diplomatic
passport.

803
01:11:52,163 --> 01:11:56,820
How are you now, Kay, are you better? Hm.

804
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:03,987
Bala, what about your chickenpox?

805
01:12:05,543 --> 01:12:09,122
Gone?
Bala: It’s gone.

806
01:12:11,814 --> 01:12:14,851
Shri Mataji: Djamel, how are you?

807
01:12:16,494 --> 01:12:21,444
Djamel: I’ve got the Agnya problem.
Shri Mataji: Agnya?

808
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:35,675
On the day of Resurrection Agnya should
clear out.

809
01:12:35,914 --> 01:12:40,164
Somebody has done everything for us, you
see? Best is to rely on that, all done!

810
01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:43,959
What, so why should we worry?

811
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:49,071
Hm, better.

812
01:12:50,873 --> 01:12:54,003
Hm. Everything is done for you,

813
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:57,824
I mean, lucky people I must say.

814
01:12:58,025 --> 01:13:02,600
Like guests, you see? That till, all
others have to do everything for you,

815
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:06,627
and you have the fruits of it. Isn’t it?
A good situation.

816
01:13:06,828 --> 01:13:14,103
 But still you look so worried.

817
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:23,107
As we say, there’s a dog walking under
a cart.

818
01:13:23,323 --> 01:13:29,105
He looks very worried because he thinks
he is carrying the cart, you see.

819
01:13:29,306 --> 01:13:37,162
And the poor – the one, one, the bullocks
which are pulling the cart are quite happy.

820
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,980
Better now?

821
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:54,226
Is it true that in Islam they hate dogs?
Yogi: No, Mother.

822
01:13:54,427 --> 01:13:58,962
Shri Mataji: No? No. They don’t hate dogs.

823
01:13:59,163 --> 01:14:04,719
In Iran they – I don’t know why they hate
dogs so much.

824
01:14:04,922 --> 01:14:08,646
Somebody was telling me that they ill-treat
dogs, absolutely.

825
01:14:08,847 --> 01:14:12,014
I said, “Surprising it is.”
Yogi: Same in Malaysia.

826
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:14,498
Shri Mataji: Hm? Yogi: They are not well
treated, animals in general

827
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:16,375
are not well treated.
Shri Mataji: They?

828
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:20,919
Yogi: They are very badly treated, You
know? Shri Mataji: Badly treated.

829
01:14:21,143 --> 01:14:27,632
Because, you see, they have become little
insensitive to animals, I think so.

830
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:30,870
Like here people treat the dogs very
kindly,

831
01:14:31,071 --> 01:14:34,974
but their children very unkindly.
Is the other way round.

832
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:39,400
I mean, it’s - just don’t understand, it’s
a mystery as I said.

833
01:15:02,342 --> 01:15:05,058
Those who want to see me, can come.

834
01:15:05,259 --> 01:15:10,514
Tomorrow evening I’ll be at home.

835
01:15:12,371 --> 01:15:14,835
All right?

836
01:15:16,463 --> 01:15:19,689
About, say, six o’clock.

837
01:15:20,071 --> 01:15:25,298
Then Sahasrara Puja must be fixed in the
evening, so that everybody can make it.

838
01:15:25,499 --> 01:15:29,604
Say about seven o’clock, that would be
good.

839
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:35,126
Many people can come there – evening
because it’s a Wednesday or something.

840
01:15:35,358 --> 01:15:39,511
It’s a Wednesday? [Gavin: “Yes”] So Tuesday-
Wednesday Thursday- Friday, perhaps?

841
01:15:39,712 --> 01:15:43,165
Gavin: No, it’s a Wednesday.
Shri Mataji: It’s a Wednesday?

842
01:15:43,857 --> 01:15:45,947
Are you sure?

843
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:49,021
Because if second is Tuesday…
Gavin: No, second is Sunday.

844
01:15:49,222 --> 01:15:52,294
Shri Mataji: Hm? Second is Tuesday.
Gavin: No, it’s Sunday.

845
01:15:52,495 --> 01:15:55,790
Shri Mataji: Is a Sunday. Then it’s all
right, Wednesday.

846
01:15:55,991 --> 01:16:00,932
So one should try to have it about seven
o’clock,

847
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:04,076
so that others can come in for the puja.

848
01:16:04,277 --> 01:16:07,845
Now, is it over? Or…

849
01:16:09,036 --> 01:16:12,681
Yogi: … John Glower is here, and he’s
supposed to be …

850
01:16:12,882 --> 01:16:16,190
Shri Mataji: Where is he?

851
01:16:18,465 --> 01:16:21,726
So we can start the puja business because
otherwise it will get very late.

852
01:16:21,927 --> 01:16:27,152
All right? [Yogi: “Yes.”] When you, when
you get it…

853
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:31,523
Yogi: …called Sahaja. Sahaja comes from
Indian language and it means

854
01:16:31,724 --> 01:16:35,403
“born with you”, or “spontaneous”, because
essentially Yoga

855
01:16:35,604 --> 01:16:39,323
isn’t just something that allows to keep
fit as has become in the West now.

856
01:16:39,524 --> 01:16:43,052
Yoga means union, union of your Self and
your Spirit,

857
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:50,345
or of your Spirit and the Great Spirit,
which is the Divine, or God (…).

858
01:16:50,546 --> 01:16:54,504
And in that in fact your Spirit – which
again people nowadays

859
01:16:54,705 --> 01:16:56,813
don’t even know exists, most of them
usually feel embarrassed

860
01:16:57,014 --> 01:17:00,212
when you talk about souls and Spirit,
in fact is a reality.

861
01:17:00,436 --> 01:17:04,499
It is that within which is the true nature,

862
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:10,242
its qualities are pure bliss, pure
consciousness and truth.

863
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:15,887
And if one can experience that Spirit
consciously, then obviously

864
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:19,045
one can be a very blissful person and not
have the problems that most people have.

865
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:22,802
The question is: how do you get it? And
Sahaja means it is spontaneous,

866
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:27,489
in other words something now for the first
time has made spontaneous

867
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:33,173
Self-Realization, or knowing yourself fully
possible for the first time.

868
01:17:33,374 --> 01:17:35,259
Interviewer: You say “something”. Just
what is this something?

869
01:17:35,459 --> 01:17:40,550
Yogi: This something is the fact that in
the sacrum bone,

870
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,927
which is the bone at the base of the spine,
is a being,

871
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:48,536
that we call Kundalini, people in the East
call it as Kundalini.

872
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:53,298
The Christians also have come across it,
but they called it Holy Spirit.

873
01:17:53,499 --> 01:17:55,890
Jesus has talked about it too. And …
Interviewer: The fact that the Christians

874
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:58,536
that it is in the bone, they wouldn’t like.
Yogi: No, they wouldn’t, no, they wouldn’t

875
01:17:58,737 --> 01:18:01,199
but nevertheless Christ talked about it,
that’s the essential thing,

876
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:05,270
not that the Christians would necessarily;
but rather what Christ said.

877
01:18:05,471 --> 01:18:13,429
Now, somehow this being, which is
the Divine inside,

878
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:19,624
has to link up the individual Spirit - we
say the Atma, the personal Spirit -

879
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:24,041
with the One, the Divine, right? And
the way that happens

880
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:29,791
is that the Kundalini rises up the spine,
enlightens Spirit,

881
01:18:29,992 --> 01:18:34,164
and pierces – it goes to actually seven
subtle centres called chakras –

882
01:18:34,372 --> 01:18:36,778
which I will tell about in a minute if you
like –

883
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:40,673
until it pierces the fontanel bone on top
of the head,

884
01:18:40,874 --> 01:18:42,967
this top chakra, the top center.

885
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:46,360
When that happens, the personal spiritual
reality inside,

886
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:49,251
which is the Spirit and the subtle centres
and the Kundalini,

887
01:18:49,452 --> 01:18:52,318
which is latent if you like Divine power
within,

888
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:55,799
all are brought into the conscious nervous
system for the first time.

889
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,978
Interviewer: If this is there, or has been
there all the time,

890
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,891
why is it that it hasn’t happened before?
Yogi: Why it hasn’t happened before,

891
01:19:01,092 --> 01:19:03,433
well, it happened before in a few cases,

892
01:19:03,634 --> 01:19:07,222
there have been enlightened people who were
great saints,

893
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:09,878
people with immense courage and spiritual
power

894
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,937
who did have their Self-Realisation before,

895
01:19:12,137 --> 01:19:15,921
I mean you could say that Lord Buddha
was a man

896
01:19:16,129 --> 01:19:19,852
who, because of his great perfection,
attained his spiritual life,

897
01:19:20,053 --> 01:19:21,854
in other words the Kundalini came up fully,

898
01:19:22,055 --> 01:19:25,214
and he was totally as we’d say
God-realised, in other words

899
01:19:25,422 --> 01:19:28,952
he became a hollow personality flowing
as if played through, his ego just went,

900
01:19:29,153 --> 01:19:32,554
as well as his conditionings went, and he
was just as the Spirit.

901
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:35,227
And now it happens to anybody, and this is
the main thing,

902
01:19:35,428 --> 01:19:38,295
this is the interesting, exciting and
thoroughly enjoyable thing;

903
01:19:38,496 --> 01:19:41,795
but now, it isn’t a case that just a few
sages go and live on a mountain

904
01:19:41,996 --> 01:19:43,976
in a pure, absolutely perfect knowledge

905
01:19:44,177 --> 01:19:47,651
may at the end of all [unclear] time
get their Self-Realisation:

906
01:19:47,852 --> 01:19:51,131
now, any of us who desire it, any of us
who are seeking it,

907
01:19:51,331 --> 01:19:53,881
genuine seekers can get their
Self-Realisation.

908
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:57,361
And the reason for that is that an Indian
lady, called Mataji,

909
01:19:57,561 --> 01:19:59,913
Her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi,

910
01:20:00,114 --> 01:20:04,923
has come absolutely foremost to give
this gift of Self-Realisation,

911
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:07,791
by which – not that She is a guru who has
come just to,

912
01:20:07,992 --> 01:20:11,129
you know, have people sit at Her feet,
and pay money and so on;

913
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:13,731
on the contrary, She said you can’t pay
for the Divine,

914
01:20:13,932 --> 01:20:18,514
you can’t pay for your Yoga, your Union
with your Spirit and God.

915
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:23,628
It happens spontaneously, and the reason
it happens, is because in Her presence

916
01:20:23,829 --> 01:20:28,439
vibrations which come from Her, or even
from the photograph of Her,

917
01:20:28,648 --> 01:20:31,465
come in through the upper side
of the hands,

918
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:35,564
and that acts as a trigger for
the Kundalini which is residing,

919
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:38,386
which as you say we don’t know about,
which may have been there –

920
01:20:38,587 --> 01:20:41,960
is there nevertheless whether we know
about it or not - at the base of the spine.

921
01:20:42,161 --> 01:20:44,805
This rises up and that cool breeze,

922
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,672
what you feel as cool breeze in your hands,
all right?

923
01:20:46,873 --> 01:20:49,532
Vibrations flowing from Mataji
in full-fledged form –

924
01:20:49,733 --> 01:20:53,059
the Kundalini then comes up and you begin
to feel things in your…

925
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,710
Interviewer: There are many people that - do you know that the real fact is,

926
01:20:55,911 --> 01:20:56,877
and I have to say this…
Yogi: Yes.

927
01:20:57,078 --> 01:20:59,153
Interviewer: …is that there are lots and
lots of people

928
01:20:59,353 --> 01:21:01,241
who are saying very similar types
of things;

929
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:08,048
and also lots of people, let’s have it,
just… (indistinct words), you know.

930
01:21:08,249 --> 01:21:11,843
What’s the difference between this one
and the rest? Yogi: Right.

931
01:21:12,044 --> 01:21:13,703
There are lots of differences, but
admittedly,

932
01:21:13,904 --> 01:21:17,557
because of the age we’re living in, because
there are so many things around,

933
01:21:17,758 --> 01:21:23,170
some of which have been absolutely proved
by psychologists and other people,

934
01:21:23,371 --> 01:21:27,249
just intelligent people, to be absolutely
dangerous and damaging to people.

935
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,683
That has to tell you the difference,
you have to have a discernment.

936
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:33,353
Discernment, as I said beforehand is that
you have to judge Mataji,

937
01:21:33,553 --> 01:21:37,663
you have to judge Sahaja Yoga on what you
feel about it I suppose, right?

938
01:21:37,864 --> 01:21:40,708
Before your Realisation. And also using
consent.

939
01:21:40,947 --> 01:21:44,215
But Mataji’s message is this: you can’t pay
for the Divine, absolutely not,

940
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,946
it’s satanic to try and pay for the Divine.

941
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:50,563
Secondly, if a thing is genuine, you are
not going to get bad side effects,

942
01:21:50,764 --> 01:21:53,521
you are not going to feel ill: if a thing
is holy and is good and pure

943
01:21:53,722 --> 01:21:58,780
you’ll feel good; and it will be obvious in
your whole personality (indistinct words).

944
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,799
And equally,

945
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,656
you can’t come to this spiritual
Realisation, or God you could say,

946
01:22:06,857 --> 01:22:09,800
or your Spirit or the truth, you can’t come
to that

947
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:14,030
on a path which is unrighteous, you can’t
come to that on a path

948
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:19,762
of unholiness, of immorality, or
of extreme behaviour.

949
01:22:19,964 --> 01:22:23,124
Interviewer: But you know, there are lots
of others who tell exactly the same words.

950
01:22:23,325 --> 01:22:25,563
Then  what’s the difference between
yourselves and say Raja Yoga?

951
01:22:25,764 --> 01:22:27,128
Now they don’t get money either.

952
01:22:27,336 --> 01:22:29,107
Yogi: The fact is that we have the actual
happening,

953
01:22:29,307 --> 01:22:31,845
which you can feel inside yourself, you
feel the cool breeze.

954
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:35,469
When you get Realisation, and anybody
gets it - you don’t have to pay for it -

955
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:38,973
you feel the cool breeze in your hands
coming from the picture or from Mataji.

956
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:41,207
As soon as you actually feel, and you have
to verify for yourself,

957
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:43,993
and you might say “there’s a cool breeze”,
doesn’t make a cool breeze;

958
01:22:44,194 --> 01:22:46,741
but if you feel the cool breeze you can’t
really deny it.

959
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:49,181
Secondly, you feel cool which comes out
of your head,

960
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,588
when you get Realisation, not before.

961
01:22:51,789 --> 01:22:55,812
Thirdly, you begin to feel all this
extremely subtle, very sensitive

962
01:22:56,013 --> 01:23:00,836
and beautifully made creation which is
the human personality.

963
01:23:01,037 --> 01:23:04,468
You begin to feel its subtleties.
Interviewer: Where does this all lead us?

964
01:23:04,669 --> 01:23:07,662
Where is it going to take us? Yogi: It
takes us into the future, absolutely,

965
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:11,054
or you could say into the present; it takes
you to yourself.

966
01:23:11,255 --> 01:23:15,551
When the Kundalini goes through the second
to the top chakra - the sixth chakra,

967
01:23:15,752 --> 01:23:17,846
you come into the present and you enter
a state

968
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:20,570
of thoughtless awareness, spontaneously.
It’s absolutely natural,

969
01:23:20,771 --> 01:23:23,316
it just happens, when the Kundalini
reaches that point.

970
01:23:23,517 --> 01:23:30,599
The reason for that is that, suppose you
are thinking,

971
01:23:30,815 --> 01:23:34,804
you can’t possibly be in the present, you
can’t be aware of the actually present.

972
01:23:35,005 --> 01:23:37,367
You can be aware of just what’s just
passed,

973
01:23:37,568 --> 01:23:39,437
or what’s going to happen in a very short
time,

974
01:23:39,638 --> 01:23:41,885
but you can’t be aware of the absolute
present.

975
01:23:42,086 --> 01:23:45,406
So the only way to be in the present,
absolutely, is to be thoughtless,

976
01:23:45,607 --> 01:23:50,723
and the Kundalini does this, when it
crosses that point on the forehead.

977
01:23:50,924 --> 01:23:54,266
Then you just become thoughtlessly aware
and we are in that state all the time.

978
01:23:54,467 --> 01:23:57,606
All we do is in that state. It sounds
strange, but it’s a reality.

979
01:23:57,807 --> 01:24:00,580
The cares go, the troubles go, your
problems go, as these chakras

980
01:24:00,781 --> 01:24:03,361
get cleared out by the Kundalini rising up,

981
01:24:03,562 --> 01:24:06,319
it clears out all the awful things that
cause the problems;

982
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:10,245
and you become in the end a joyful being.

983
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:13,076
Interviewer: And should you be interested,
She is holding a meeting at Caxton Hall

984
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:19,820
on Wednesday the fourteenth of April
at 7pm, everyone is welcome.

985
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:37,700
Yogi: This is what was just set up before
doing that.

986
01:24:39,836 --> 01:24:46,956
Shri Mataji: Ah? Now, the one point that’s
very important to be said

987
01:24:47,157 --> 01:24:53,074
on such interview, you see, is that you
become empowered by your own powers.

988
01:24:53,275 --> 01:24:58,146
You yourself know, you can feel it,
the other person, you can feel yourself

989
01:24:58,347 --> 01:25:03,970
and you know how to maneuver, you see,
this Kundalini of others;

990
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:06,279
you can give Realisations to others;

991
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,288
you can cure others; your power is
released.

992
01:25:10,489 --> 01:25:14,741
Your power of your Spirit is released
on your central nervous system.

993
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:17,357
That would be really convincing; that is
not my power,

994
01:25:17,558 --> 01:25:20,898
it’s your own power you can feel.

995
01:25:21,896 --> 01:25:26,214
Yogini: Mother, it seems, through talking
of other groups,

996
01:25:26,415 --> 01:25:29,528
they do all say very much the same
as we do,

997
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:34,756
but the only thing that we should say –
really has to be convincingly -

998
01:25:34,957 --> 01:25:38,210
is that we do have such powers.
Shri Mataji: That’s it.

999
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:40,245
Yogini: That’s it.
Shri Mataji: Just talking is very easy.

1000
01:25:40,445 --> 01:25:43,262
You see, if read some books, they talk.

1001
01:25:43,463 --> 01:25:46,670
See, they read a Sahaj Yoga book, they can
say, “I have a Kundalini awakening.

1002
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:49,563
I can see the chakras. I can…” All right,
say!

1003
01:25:49,764 --> 01:25:53,059
Ask them, “Can you feel our chakras?”
[Yogi: “That’s all.”]

1004
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:57,747
That’s all. Then what do they agree?

1005
01:25:57,948 --> 01:26:01,959
Then what do they say; are they going
to come?

1006
01:26:02,571 --> 01:26:04,228
Yogini: Some of them have done, yes,
Mother, we were...

1007
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:06,698
Shri Mataji: I think you should go and meet
them, again and again.

1008
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:09,950
(Yogini: “Yes, Mother.”) You see,
Amar Samati asked –

1009
01:26:10,151 --> 01:26:14,014
he went to Santa Cruz, absolutely a new
place.

1010
01:26:14,215 --> 01:26:16,550
And he met people and talked to them and
told them,

1011
01:26:16,751 --> 01:26:20,608
“See, you are not feeling anything, why are
you adhering to any group, for what?

1012
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:24,318
For paying money? For what? Because you
have been doing it,

1013
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:26,762
but you are not feeling any vibrations,
nothing;

1014
01:26:26,962 --> 01:26:30,818
you are not feeling anything, you have
no powers.” And he convinced them.

1015
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,567
And he said, “There will be at least five
to six hundred people,” and there were –

1016
01:26:33,768 --> 01:26:37,461
more than that, for that programme.

1017
01:26:37,662 --> 01:26:39,363
That’s what you have to go and tell them,
“What have you got?

1018
01:26:39,564 --> 01:26:42,280
You haven’t got any powers. We have,
we can feel you.

1019
01:26:42,481 --> 01:26:47,139
We know this is what, this is your chakra
is here, that is there.” That’s the thing.

1020
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:51,547
Yogini: Mother, there is a very funny
story, we went to see some Buddhists,

1021
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:55,566
and I asked one of them (...) what
enlightenment was.

1022
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:58,341
Shri Mataji: Hm. Yogini: And he gave me
a very flurry answer.

1023
01:26:58,542 --> 01:27:03,265
And I said to him, “Do you think you will
get it in this lifetime?”

1024
01:27:03,466 --> 01:27:06,380
And he says: “Oh I don’t know, I think it
might be possible.”

1025
01:27:06,581 --> 01:27:09,521
And I said, “Well, how would you know it
when you get it?”

1026
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:12,616
He said, “Oh, I suppose it will dawn on me
one day.”

1027
01:27:12,817 --> 01:27:14,874
And as he said that, his Kundalini came up!

1028
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,416
Shri Mataji: It will what, it will what?

1029
01:27:16,617 --> 01:27:19,181
Yogini: He said, “I suppose it will dawn
on me one day.”

1030
01:27:19,405 --> 01:27:22,993
And as he said it his Kundalini came up.

1031
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:28,730
Shri Mataji: Good.

1032
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:35,494
I’m also sending – you see these… Somehow,
with my husband’s job,

1033
01:27:35,695 --> 01:27:39,242
I meet people who are seekers and who are
placed at the helm of affairs.

1034
01:27:39,443 --> 01:27:41,018
I’m sending them books, you see?

1035
01:27:41,219 --> 01:27:47,999
And I want to send one of the, one of our
books, to Indonesia.

1036
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:50,907
There’s an ambassador from Indonesia
who’s very anxious,

1037
01:27:51,108 --> 01:27:54,119
so he has been writing to my husband that,
“You haven’t sent the book as yet.”

1038
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,366
So we’ll have to send it there.

1039
01:28:05,999 --> 01:28:08,713
Yogini: Mother, Warren has sent this
cassette up,

1040
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:12,947
it’s the first VHS copy of the…
(inaudible audio)

1041
01:28:17,234 --> 01:28:22,494
Shri Mataji: Oh all right, let’s see.
Can we see here?

1042
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:34,111
I don’t know what nail paint these people
have put, I don’t know.

1043
01:28:34,334 --> 01:28:40,078
Indian. Doesn’t go with any English
nail paint remover.

1044
01:28:40,278 --> 01:28:42,955
Can you believe it?

1045
01:28:44,718 --> 01:28:48,389
Shines, though…

1046
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:57,152
I’ll just come back from -

1047
01:28:57,542 --> 01:29:02,069
It’s a good one, no doubt. And it’s come
out very well.

1048
01:29:18,122 --> 01:29:21,607
…and also it shakes a little bit, but
doesn’t matter,

1049
01:29:21,808 --> 01:29:23,686
but doesn’t matter, we can’t help it,
you see,

1050
01:29:23,902 --> 01:29:30,679
because originals we have in any case
and, but these must be transferred.

1051
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,951
But all the new ones should be done
on VHS, you see.

1052
01:29:34,152 --> 01:29:36,708
That’s a better new system to use, you see?

1053
01:29:36,924 --> 01:29:43,218
That’s a better idea I think, than to use
the, that one and then transfer it.

1054
01:29:43,418 --> 01:29:47,318
It’s quite good, I mean, as far as …
I mean, it gives - it fits all right,

1055
01:29:47,518 --> 01:29:49,502
but could be better if you have direct.

1056
01:29:49,703 --> 01:29:54,093
But as it is we don’t want them to be lost,
everybody would like to hear,

1057
01:29:54,294 --> 01:29:57,054
and some of them are very powerful
in Houston and all that.

1058
01:29:57,255 --> 01:30:00,719
Have you got Houston one here?

1059
01:30:00,982 --> 01:30:03,516
Gavin: There is at least one Houston,
Mother, I don’t know where it is now,

1060
01:30:03,717 --> 01:30:06,452
maybe Warren will send.
Shri Mataji: Alright, so ask him

1061
01:30:06,653 --> 01:30:11,856
to send some Houston things for people
to see, they were very powerful.

1062
01:30:12,065 --> 01:30:14,465
Specially on Christ I spoke very well.

1063
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:22,003
And why don’t you send this one
to Houston people,

1064
01:30:22,268 --> 01:30:25,824
the one on the Easter day, will be good
idea, you see?

1065
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:33,284
And if he wants to hear also, Mr. Tricky
Fellow, he could, you see.

1066
01:30:33,485 --> 01:30:39,205
No wonder, because of pressures on him,
you see?

1067
01:30:39,451 --> 01:30:42,635
You see, that is being a cult, it will
become a cult,

1068
01:30:42,835 --> 01:30:47,684
Unity Church will become a cult once
he starts tolerating everything.

1069
01:30:47,885 --> 01:30:50,200
Just write to him that, “You’ll become
a cult then,

1070
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:53,659
you don’t become a living church.

1071
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:59,716
The living things know how to discard,
what to accept.”

1072
01:31:01,082 --> 01:31:03,911
Please sit down.

1073
01:31:07,356 --> 01:31:10,810
Yogi: Excuse me, Mother, is this light
disturbing You?

1074
01:31:11,011 --> 01:31:13,850
Shri Mataji: This is what?
Yogi: Do you mind this light on?

1075
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:17,496
Shri Mataji: I didn’t see it!
Yogi: Oh.

1076
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:23,410
Shri Mataji: I think this gives a better
picture. Yogi: It does.

1077
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:27,381
Shri Mataji: It does. Yes.

1078
01:31:30,882 --> 01:31:35,149
You can get people from say Lille have
come,

1079
01:31:35,358 --> 01:31:39,820
who else from – London, you see,
the new people,

1080
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:42,462
if they don’t come forward, then how will I
know them, you see,

1081
01:31:42,662 --> 01:31:45,219
some of the new people whom I’ve not met
should come forward,

1082
01:31:45,419 --> 01:31:49,100
you see, will be good idea. You must tell
your names to me and…

1083
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:53,175
[Yogi: “Gary”]. What’s it? [Yogi: “Gary”]
Gareth. [Yogi: “Gary”]

1084
01:31:53,376 --> 01:31:58,191
Gary, Gary, all right. Gary.

1085
01:32:04,672 --> 01:32:08,250
Anybody else from Lille? Patrick, you can
come along.

1086
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:12,652
You come along – now, what’s your name?
Christopher.

1087
01:32:12,853 --> 01:32:15,922
Christopher I don’t know. Christopher
and Gary.

1088
01:32:16,123 --> 01:32:20,280
Now, who else is there?

1089
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:23,349
A new one? Come along. Patrick you
come, and you come along.

1090
01:32:23,549 --> 01:32:28,020
You also come, because you’ve come
from outside.

1091
01:32:30,196 --> 01:32:34,089
Hilary, is it all right? You’ve changed
a little bit, is it all right?

1092
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:37,045
[Yogini: “Yes, Mother”] Little bit,
because you see,

1093
01:32:37,246 --> 01:32:39,799
it’s no use going up and down
[Yogini: “Yes”],

1094
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,447
so is best is to finish with Norwich,
[Yogini: “Yes, Mother”]

1095
01:32:42,648 --> 01:32:44,552
and then be in Cambridge [Yogini: “Yes”].

1096
01:32:44,753 --> 01:32:48,722
Yogini: Mother, did I understand you were
going to spend two evenings in Cambridge,

1097
01:32:48,923 --> 01:32:51,299
and then the puja the following day.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

1098
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:53,878
[Yogini: “Or is it one evening?”] No, no,
that’s how, that’s how, that’s what it is.

1099
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:57,026
[Yogini: “Two programmes”] 18th at Norwich
[Yogini: “Yes”]

1100
01:32:57,227 --> 01:33:01,228
and 19th and 20th Cambridge
[Yogini: “Yes”],

1101
01:33:01,429 --> 01:33:06,206
and 21st the Puja. 21st is a Sunday, isn’t
it? Yogini: I hope so, Mother, yes.

1102
01:33:06,407 --> 01:33:08,769
Shri Mataji: I hope so, [Yogini: “Yes”]
because you see,

1103
01:33:08,969 --> 01:33:11,662
some people will have to come from here
for Puja. [Yogini: “Yes, Mother”]

1104
01:33:11,863 --> 01:33:15,880
Just find out, is it a Sunday, 21st?

1105
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:22,378
All right. Come along, come forward.

1106
01:33:29,076 --> 01:33:31,012
Yogi: No, it’s a Monday.
Shri Mataji: Ah.

1107
01:33:31,222 --> 01:33:34,994
I would say David, you come along,
David Prole,

1108
01:33:35,195 --> 01:33:40,220
please come along, to wash my feet.
And Kay, Kay?

1109
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:43,401
The other Kay, come along, yes. Good.

1110
01:33:47,704 --> 01:33:51,248
And Samson, where is he? Oh…

1111
01:33:51,934 --> 01:33:57,055
I call him Samson, his name is Simon
I always call him Samson.

1112
01:33:57,596 --> 01:34:02,047
I can’t forget Samson, you know, nobody is
a Samson here, just imagine!

1113
01:34:02,247 --> 01:34:06,248
Yogi: Caleb, Mother. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Caleb. Caleb’s the one, Mother.

1114
01:34:06,449 --> 01:34:10,489
Shri Mataji: Who? [Yogis: “Caleb”]
He is Samson? Who is Samson?

1115
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:16,059
Yogi: Magda’s son, Caleb.
Shri Mataji: Caleb is Samson?

1116
01:34:16,377 --> 01:34:19,298
I didn’t know!

1117
01:34:26,266 --> 01:34:30,370
So Maria, what is it now, next year will
you do for Greece, hm?

1118
01:34:30,571 --> 01:34:36,126
Maria: Next year, as You wish Mother, we
can do it this year if You like.

1119
01:34:36,327 --> 01:34:40,426
Shri Mataji: I think it’s too early. We’ll
have to go, prepare, do something there…

1120
01:34:40,627 --> 01:34:43,138
Maria: We have to go at least one month
in advance, Mother,

1121
01:34:43,339 --> 01:34:46,860
before You come, to prepare something.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

1122
01:34:47,068 --> 01:34:51,576
Maria: And then we’ll have to stay after …
in order to establish something.

1123
01:34:51,777 --> 01:34:57,550
Shri Mataji: You’ll have to stick on there.
Maria: I have written to Maria (Fujami?)

1124
01:34:57,751 --> 01:35:01,883
and I have not received an answer yet,
inviting her to come over here.

1125
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:04,819
Shri Mataji: That’s what I’m saying.
Now come along,

1126
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:07,943
you both can wash my feet first of all.

1127
01:35:08,144 --> 01:35:13,686
One by one, so this space is given to
others to also come along.

1128
01:35:13,887 --> 01:35:16,906
You just move on.

1129
01:35:17,106 --> 01:35:19,710
Let it be now, it’s not ready, just good,
you see,

1130
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:23,888
you can put it on one side, this one put it
on the here.

1131
01:35:28,706 --> 01:35:34,706
Now you can light it. You both come along
first of all to wash my feet.

1132
01:35:34,907 --> 01:35:38,999
Now what I’m saying, somebody who has
to put the water should be here,

1133
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,972
and Gavin, you better guide what is to be
read and what is to be done.

1134
01:35:43,173 --> 01:35:46,090
Now come along, both of you come. One
of you should drop the -

1135
01:35:46,291 --> 01:35:50,645
yes, you put the water, come along, she can
do it, come that side.

1136
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:56,050
Now you, be careful, that’s all fallen off.
Yes.

1137
01:35:57,646 --> 01:36:02,682
Why don’t you put the light at the back
there, somebody can gradually - with care,

1138
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:06,338
somebody with great care has to do it,
there’s oil in it,

1139
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:10,232
it’s very heavy, it’s very heavy!

1140
01:36:13,804 --> 01:36:17,619
Now, come along. Yes.

1141
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:21,100
Would be better if you put it there and
then light it.

1142
01:36:21,301 --> 01:36:24,913
Put it right first of all. I think Marcus
knows how to do it, Marcus?

1143
01:36:25,121 --> 01:36:28,665
Come along. Yes. You come along, you also.

1144
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:32,151
What about your watch, is it all right?
Good.

1145
01:36:32,352 --> 01:36:38,690
Wipe - now rub it, rub hard, rub hard,
rub it hard.

1146
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:56,877
Where is the matchbox? With sahaja yogis
you won’t find matchboxes!

1147
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:02,272
Rub it hard. Yes.

1148
01:37:22,476 --> 01:37:25,879
They have offered it now. No need of…

Yogi: Say all Mother’s mantras.

Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

1164
01:38:48,972 --> 01:38:53,163
Shri Mataji: [Aside to the person] May God
bless you. Now let them come here.

1165
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:06,145
Rub it hard. Here. Void.

1166
01:39:06,361 --> 01:39:09,203
[Gospel of Matthew: 6,1-6.16-18]
Then Christ said unto his disciples:

1167
01:39:09,404 --> 01:39:13,431
²Therefore, when thou doest thine alms,
do not sound a trumpet before thee,

1168
01:39:13,632 --> 01:39:16,446
as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
and in the streets

1169
01:39:16,647 --> 01:39:18,665
that they may have glory of men.

1170
01:39:18,866 --> 01:39:22,077
Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward.

1171
01:39:22,278 --> 01:39:27,293
³But when thou doest alms, let not thy left
hand know what thy right hand doeth

1172
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:31,861
⁴that thine alms may be in secret; and thy
Father which sees thee in secret,

1173
01:39:32,062 --> 01:39:35,434
himself shall reward thee openly.

1174
01:39:35,635 --> 01:39:39,410
⁵And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be
as the hypocrites are,

1175
01:39:39,611 --> 01:39:41,551
for they love to pray standing
in the synagogues

1176
01:39:41,752 --> 01:39:45,414
and in the corners of the streets that they
may be seen of men.

1177
01:39:45,615 --> 01:39:48,487
Verily I say unto you, They have their
reward.

1178
01:39:48,688 --> 01:39:52,413
⁶But thou, when thou prayest, enter
into thy closet,

1179
01:39:52,614 --> 01:39:56,458
and when thou hast shut thy door, pray
to thy Father which is in secret;

1180
01:39:56,659 --> 01:40:00,636
and thy Father which sees thee in secret
shall reward thee openly.

1181
01:40:00,837 --> 01:40:04,911
⁷But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions
as the heathen do,

1182
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:08,445
for they think that they shall be heard
for their much speaking.

1183
01:40:08,646 --> 01:40:11,997
⁸Be not ye therefore like unto them,
for your Father knows

1184
01:40:12,198 --> 01:40:15,357
what things ye have need of before
ye ask him.

1185
01:40:15,558 --> 01:40:18,844
⁹After this manner pray therefore:

1186
01:40:19,045 --> 01:40:23,712
Our Father who are in heavens,
Hallowed be thy name.

1187
01:40:23,913 --> 01:40:25,812
¹⁰Thy kingdom come.

1188
01:40:26,058 --> 01:40:30,456
Thy will be done in earth, as it is
in heaven.

1189
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:36,228
¹¹Give us this day our daily bread and
forgive us our trespasses,

1190
01:40:36,445 --> 01:40:40,111
as we forgive those who trespass
against us;

1191
01:40:40,312 --> 01:40:45,588
¹³And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,

1192
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:49,967
for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory,

1193
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:54,900
forever and ever. Amen.

1194
01:41:04,574 --> 01:41:06,652
Yogi: From the Gospel of Saint John.

1195
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:10,098
Shri Mataji: Good. Water… you take out
in… this water.

1196
01:41:11,503 --> 01:41:13,666
¹Now before the feast of the passover,

1197
01:41:13,867 --> 01:41:15,763
when Jesus knew that his hour was come

1198
01:41:15,964 --> 01:41:18,854
that he should depart out of this world
unto the Father,

1199
01:41:19,055 --> 01:41:23,333
having loved his own which were in the
world, he loved them unto the end.

1200
01:41:23,534 --> 01:41:25,654
²And supper being ended,

1201
01:41:25,855 --> 01:41:28,468
the devil having now put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot,

1202
01:41:28,669 --> 01:41:30,866
Simon’s son, to betray him;

1203
01:41:31,067 --> 01:41:34,647
³Jesus knowing that the Father had given
all things into his hands,

1204
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:38,335
and that he was come from God, and went
to God;

1205
01:41:38,536 --> 01:41:41,485
⁴He riseth from supper, and laid aside
his garments;

1206
01:41:41,686 --> 01:41:44,528
and took a towel, and girded himself.

1207
01:41:44,729 --> 01:41:47,488
⁵After that he poureth water into a bason,

1208
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:50,291
and began to wash the disciples’ feet,

1209
01:41:50,492 --> 01:41:54,527
and to wipe them with the towel wherewith
he was girded.

1210
01:41:54,728 --> 01:41:58,372
⁶Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter
saith unto him,

1211
01:41:58,573 --> 01:42:01,684
Lord, dost thou wash my feet?

1212
01:42:01,885 --> 01:42:04,004
⁷Jesus answered and said unto him,

1213
01:42:04,205 --> 01:42:09,101
What I do thou knowest not now; but thou
shalt know hereafter.

1214
01:42:09,302 --> 01:42:12,724
⁸Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
wash my feet.

1215
01:42:12,925 --> 01:42:17,593
Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not,
thou hast no part with me.

1216
01:42:17,802 --> 01:42:20,924
⁹Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord,
not my feet only,

1217
01:42:21,124 --> 01:42:24,029
but also my hands and my head.

1218
01:42:24,230 --> 01:42:28,192
¹⁰Jesus saith unto him, He that is washed

1219
01:42:28,393 --> 01:42:32,433
needeth not save to wash his feet, but
is clean every whit:

1220
01:42:32,634 --> 01:42:35,509
and ye are clean, but not all.

1221
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:38,870
¹¹For he knew who should betray him;
therefore said he,

1222
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:41,392
Ye are not all clean.

1223
01:42:41,593 --> 01:42:44,384
¹²So after he had washed their feet, and
had taken his garments,

1224
01:42:44,585 --> 01:42:47,292
and was set down again, he said unto them,

1225
01:42:47,493 --> 01:42:49,517
Know ye what I have done to you?

1226
01:42:49,718 --> 01:42:54,218
¹³Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say
well; for so I am.

1227
01:42:54,419 --> 01:42:57,208
¹⁴If I then, your Lord and Master, have
washed your feet;

1228
01:42:57,409 --> 01:42:59,980
ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.

1229
01:43:00,181 --> 01:43:03,889
¹⁵For I have given you an example, that
ye should do as I have done to you.

1230
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:06,352
¹⁶Verily, verily, I say unto you,

1231
01:43:06,553 --> 01:43:09,013
The servant is not greater than his lord;

1232
01:43:09,214 --> 01:43:12,557
neither he that is sent greater than he
that sent him.

1233
01:43:12,758 --> 01:43:18,195
¹⁷If ye know these things, happy are ye
if ye do them.

1234
01:43:31,617 --> 01:43:33,581
Other yogi [continues]: ¹⁸I speak not
of you all:

1235
01:43:33,782 --> 01:43:36,484
I know whom I have chosen:

1236
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:39,361
but that the scripture may be fulfilled,

1237
01:43:39,562 --> 01:43:44,468
He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up
his heel against me.

1238
01:43:44,674 --> 01:43:46,769
¹⁹Now I tell you before it come,

1239
01:43:46,969 --> 01:43:51,868
that, when it is come to pass, ye may
believe that I am he.

1240
01:43:52,069 --> 01:43:55,006
²⁰Verily, verily, I say unto you…
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

1241
01:43:55,207 --> 01:43:58,789
Yogi: He that receiveth whomsoever I send
receiveth me;

1242
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:03,571
and he that receiveth me receiveth him
that sent me.

1243
01:44:03,772 --> 01:44:07,218
²¹When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled
in spirit,

1244
01:44:07,419 --> 01:44:10,930
and testified, and said, Verily, verily,

1245
01:44:11,131 --> 01:44:15,365
I say unto you, that one of you shall
betray me.

1246
01:44:15,566 --> 01:44:21,322
²²Then the disciples looked upon one
another, doubting of whom he spake.

1247
01:44:21,523 --> 01:44:27,476
²³Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom
one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

1248
01:44:27,677 --> 01:44:29,949
²⁴Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him,

1249
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:34,253
that he should ask who it should be
of whom he spake.

1250
01:44:34,454 --> 01:44:40,414
²⁵He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith
unto him, Lord, who is it?

1251
01:44:40,615 --> 01:44:44,579
²⁶Jesus answered, He it is, to whom…

1252
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:46,008
Shri Mataji: Now somebody else should
read, because he has to wash…

1253
01:44:46,208 --> 01:44:48,326
Yogi: I shall give a sop, when I have
dipped it.

1254
01:44:48,527 --> 01:44:51,632
And when he had dipped the sop, he gave
it to Judas Iscariot,

1255
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:54,696
the son of Simon.

1256
01:44:54,897 --> 01:44:57,152
Shri Mataji: Simon, you come.

1257
01:44:57,353 --> 01:45:01,497
You come, both of you, then David will
do it also.

1258
01:45:01,697 --> 01:45:06,527
He has to wash. Who else is there? David
and who else?

1259
01:45:07,123 --> 01:45:11,812
Let Pat come to join David. Pat is there?
Come along.

1260
01:45:12,012 --> 01:45:15,765
Yes. You wash my feet.

1261
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:23,863
Rub it hard.

1262
01:45:27,371 --> 01:45:30,320
Other yogi: ²⁷And after the sop Satan
entered into him.

1263
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:35,636
Then Jesus said unto him, That thou
doest, do quickly.

1264
01:45:35,837 --> 01:45:37,851
²⁸Now no man at the table knew

1265
01:45:38,052 --> 01:45:40,981
for what intent he spake this unto him.

1266
01:45:41,182 --> 01:45:44,528
²⁹For some of them thought, because Judas
had the bag,

1267
01:45:44,729 --> 01:45:48,413
that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those
things

1268
01:45:48,614 --> 01:45:51,432
that we have need of against the feast;

1269
01:45:51,633 --> 01:45:54,737
or, that he should give something
to the poor.

1270
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:59,733
³⁰He then having received the sop went
immediately out: and it was night.

1271
01:45:59,934 --> 01:46:03,044
³¹Therefore, when he was gone out,
Jesus said,

1272
01:46:03,287 --> 01:46:07,949
Now is the Son of man glorified, and God
is glorified in him.

1273
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:10,496
³²And if God be glorified in him,

1274
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:16,829
God shall also glorify him in himself,

1275
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:19,572
and shall straightway glorify him.

1276
01:46:19,773 --> 01:46:24,007
³³Little children, yet a little while I am
with you.

1277
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:29,218
Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto
the Jews,

1278
01:46:29,419 --> 01:46:34,587
Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now
I say to you.

1279
01:46:34,788 --> 01:46:37,060
³⁴A new commandment I give unto you,

1280
01:46:37,261 --> 01:46:40,722
That ye shall love one another; as I have
loved you,

1281
01:46:40,923 --> 01:46:44,212
that ye shall also love one another.

1282
01:46:44,413 --> 01:46:48,628
³⁵By this shall all men know that ye are
my disciples,

1283
01:46:48,829 --> 01:46:52,623
if ye have love one to another.

1284
01:46:52,824 --> 01:46:59,066
³⁶Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither
goest thou?

1285
01:46:59,267 --> 01:47:03,200
Jesus answered him, [Whither] I go,

1286
01:47:03,438 --> 01:47:08,661
thou canst not follow me now; but thou
shalt follow me afterwards.

1287
01:47:08,862 --> 01:47:13,559
³⁷Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot
I follow thee now?

1288
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,282
I will lay down my life for thy sake.

1289
01:47:16,485 --> 01:47:21,408
³⁸Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down
thy life for my sake?

1290
01:47:21,609 --> 01:47:24,435
Verily, verily, I say unto thee,

1291
01:47:24,636 --> 01:47:31,948
The cock shall not crow, till thou hast
denied me thrice.

1292
01:47:41,576 --> 01:47:43,363
Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Put it
a little bit…

1293
01:47:43,563 --> 01:47:45,677
Other yogi: ¹Let not your heart be
troubled:

1294
01:47:45,878 --> 01:47:50,285
 ye believe in God, believe also in me.

1295
01:47:50,512 --> 01:47:54,752
²In my Father’s house are many mansions:

1296
01:47:54,953 --> 01:47:58,399
if it were not so, I would have told you.

1297
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,877
I go to prepare a place for you.

1298
01:48:01,078 --> 01:48:04,015
³And if I go and prepare a place for you,

1299
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:08,442
I will come again, and receive you unto
myself;

1300
01:48:08,643 --> 01:48:13,392
that where I am, there ye may be also.

1301
01:48:13,609 --> 01:48:18,803
⁴And whither I go ye know, and the way
ye know.

1302
01:48:19,581 --> 01:48:25,150
⁵Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not
whither thou goest;

1303
01:48:25,351 --> 01:48:28,586
and how can we know the way?

1304
01:48:28,837 --> 01:48:35,527
⁶Jesus saith unto him, I am the way,
the truth, and the life:

1305
01:48:35,728 --> 01:48:40,081
no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

1306
01:48:40,282 --> 01:48:45,206
⁷If ye had known me, ye should have known
my Father also:

1307
01:48:45,407 --> 01:48:50,650
and from henceforth ye know him, and have
seen him.

1308
01:48:51,278 --> 01:48:57,413
Shri Mataji: “Have seen Him”: see, this
point they miss!

1309
01:49:01,576 --> 01:49:07,422
Yogi: ⁸Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us
the Father, and it sufficeth us.

1310
01:49:07,623 --> 01:49:11,275
⁹Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long
with you,

1311
01:49:11,476 --> 01:49:15,398
and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?

1312
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:18,824
He that hath seen me hath seen the Father;

1313
01:49:19,025 --> 01:49:22,883
and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?

1314
01:49:23,092 --> 01:49:29,279
¹⁰Believest thou not that I am in
the Father, and the Father in me?

1315
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:33,490
The words that I speak unto you I speak
not of myself:

1316
01:49:33,691 --> 01:49:38,527
but the Father that dwelleth in me,
he doeth the works.

1317
01:49:38,728 --> 01:49:44,084
¹¹Believe me that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me:

1318
01:49:44,285 --> 01:49:49,239
or else believe me for the very
works’ sake.

1319
01:49:49,791 --> 01:49:55,634
¹²Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
believeth on me,

1320
01:49:55,835 --> 01:50:00,606
the works that I do shall he also do;

1321
01:50:00,807 --> 01:50:06,277
and greater works than these shall he do;
because I go unto my Father.

1322
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:10,459
¹³And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name,
that will I do,

1323
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:14,376
that the Father may be glorified
in the Son.

1324
01:50:14,577 --> 01:50:21,432
¹⁴If ye shall ask any thing in my name,
I will do it.

1325
01:50:24,756 --> 01:50:28,247
Shri Mataji: Good, beautiful. Come.
Good, now:

1326
01:50:28,448 --> 01:50:33,730
you can take this water in something
else this side. Take it.

1327
01:50:38,558 --> 01:50:43,290
Take the other one now, better…

1328
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:50,801
Good. Yogi: ¹⁵If ye love me, keep my
commandments.

1329
01:50:51,002 --> 01:50:56,083
Shri Mataji: Loudly. Yogi: ¹⁵If ye love me,
keep my commandments.

1330
01:50:56,298 --> 01:51:01,475
¹⁶And I will pray the Father, and he shall
give you another Comforter,

1331
01:51:01,718 --> 01:51:05,393
that he may abide with you for ever;

1332
01:51:05,594 --> 01:51:09,627
¹⁷Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world
cannot receive,

1333
01:51:09,828 --> 01:51:13,369
because it seeth him not, neither knoweth
him:

1334
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:20,381
but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you,
and shall be in you.

1335
01:51:20,582 --> 01:51:25,415
¹⁸I will not leave you comfortless: I will
come to you.

1336
01:51:25,615 --> 01:51:29,912
¹⁹Yet a little while, and the world seeth
me no more;

1337
01:51:30,113 --> 01:51:36,370
but ye see me: because I live, ye shall
live also.

1338
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:41,044
²⁰At that day ye shall know that I am
in my Father,

1339
01:51:41,244 --> 01:51:45,188
and ye in me, and I in you.

1340
01:51:45,389 --> 01:51:49,097
²¹He that hath my commandments, and
keepeth them,

1341
01:51:49,298 --> 01:51:53,858
he it is that loveth me: and he that
loveth me

1342
01:51:54,059 --> 01:51:56,984
shall be loved of my Father and I will
love him …

1343
01:51:57,185 --> 01:52:00,738
Shri Mataji: See now: First Commandment
he said, that you love each other.

1344
01:52:00,939 --> 01:52:04,239
The disciples must love each other, he
didn’t say any Dick, Tom and Harry.

1345
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:07,503
First love the disciples, all of you should
love each other,

1346
01:52:07,704 --> 01:52:10,436
that’s the main thing is. First thing
is that.

1347
01:52:10,637 --> 01:52:16,735
Second is, “My father”. See
the relationship.

1348
01:52:17,871 --> 01:52:23,037
Yogi: … and I will love him, and will
manifest myself to him.

1349
01:52:23,238 --> 01:52:27,697
²²Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord,

1350
01:52:27,898 --> 01:52:33,759
how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself
unto us, and not unto the world?

1351
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,657
²³Jesus answered and said unto him,

1352
01:52:37,858 --> 01:52:40,851
If a man love me, he will keep my words:

1353
01:52:41,052 --> 01:52:44,928
and my Father will love him, and we will
come unto him,

1354
01:52:45,128 --> 01:52:48,048
and make our abode with him.

1355
01:52:48,249 --> 01:52:53,140
²⁴He that loveth me not keepeth not
my sayings:

1356
01:52:53,341 --> 01:52:58,512
and the word which ye hear is (not) mine,
but the Father’s which sent me.

1357
01:52:58,713 --> 01:53:03,893
²⁵These things have I spoken unto you,
being yet present with you.

1358
01:53:04,171 --> 01:53:07,651
²⁶But the Comforter, which is the Holy
Ghost,

1359
01:53:07,852 --> 01:53:10,987
 whom the Father will send in my name,

1360
01:53:11,188 --> 01:53:15,761
he shall teach you all things, and bring
all things to your remembrance,

1361
01:53:15,962 --> 01:53:19,456
whatsoever I have said unto you.

1362
01:53:19,657 --> 01:53:24,650
²⁷Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you:

1363
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:28,529
not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

1364
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:33,661
Let not your heart be troubled, neither
let it be afraid.

1365
01:53:33,862 --> 01:53:36,981
²⁸Ye have heard how I said unto you,
I go away,

1366
01:53:37,182 --> 01:53:41,980
and come again unto you. If ye loved me,

1367
01:53:42,181 --> 01:53:45,802
ye would rejoice, because I said, I go
unto the Father:

1368
01:53:46,003 --> 01:53:49,593
for my Father is greater than I.

1369
01:53:56,798 --> 01:54:00,010
Shri Mataji: Good. Start it with the high
tones, will keep it up, you see.

1370
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:02,297
The thing is people must hear you.

1371
01:54:02,497 --> 01:54:06,021
Good. Now just see the hands - vibrations.

1372
01:54:06,222 --> 01:54:10,105
Gavin: And now I have told you before
it come to pass,

1373
01:54:10,322 --> 01:54:14,936
that, when it is come to pass, ye might
believe.

1374
01:54:15,137 --> 01:54:17,527
³⁰Hereafter I will not talk much with you:

1375
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:23,182
for the prince of this world cometh, and
hath nothing in me.

1376
01:54:23,383 --> 01:54:26,719
³¹But that the world may know that I love
the Father;

1377
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:31,743
and as the Father gave me commandment,
even so I do.

1378
01:54:31,944 --> 01:54:37,279
Shri Mataji: Hm!
Yogi: Arise, let us go hence.

1379
01:54:39,345 --> 01:54:45,419
¹I am the true vine, and my Father is
the husbandman.

1380
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:51,357
²Every branch in me that beareth not fruit
he taketh away:

1381
01:54:51,558 --> 01:54:55,219
and every branch that beareth fruit,
he purgeth it…

1382
01:54:55,420 --> 01:54:59,914
Shri Mataji: See!
Gavin: …that it may bring forth more fruit.

1383
01:55:00,939 --> 01:55:05,745
³Now ye are clean through the word which
I have spoken unto you.

1384
01:55:05,946 --> 01:55:11,038
⁴Abide in me, and I in you.

1385
01:55:11,239 --> 01:55:16,503
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
except it abide in the vine;

1386
01:55:16,704 --> 01:55:21,603
no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

1387
01:55:21,819 --> 01:55:25,629
⁵I am the vine, ye are the branches:

1388
01:55:25,830 --> 01:55:28,919
He that abideth in me, and I in him,

1389
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:32,545
the same bringeth forth much fruit:

1390
01:55:32,746 --> 01:55:36,928
for without me ye can do nothing.

1391
01:55:37,691 --> 01:55:43,099
⁶If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth
as a branch, and is withered;

1392
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:49,201
and men gather them, and cast them into
the fire, and they are burned.

1393
01:55:49,844 --> 01:55:53,587
⁷If ye abide in me, and my words abide
in you,

1394
01:55:53,788 --> 01:55:58,612
ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be
done unto you.

1395
01:55:58,813 --> 01:56:03,534
⁸Herein is my Father glorified, that ye
bear much fruit;

1396
01:56:03,735 --> 01:56:07,643
so shall ye be my disciples.

1397
01:56:08,882 --> 01:56:13,586
⁹As the Father hath loved me, so have I
loved you:

1398
01:56:13,787 --> 01:56:17,198
continue ye in my love.

1399
01:56:17,415 --> 01:56:21,777
¹⁰If ye keep my commandments, ye shall
abide in my love;

1400
01:56:21,994 --> 01:56:28,593
even as I have kept my Father’s
commandments, and abide in his love.

1401
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:32,558
¹¹These things have I spoken unto you,
Shri Mataji: All right. Now come along.

1402
01:56:32,759 --> 01:56:36,323
Gavin: ... that my joy might remain in you,
Shri Mataji: Now come.

1403
01:56:36,524 --> 01:56:42,025
John and Don. Yes. Just take it ...

1404
01:56:42,226 --> 01:56:46,923
Gavin:  and that your joy might be full.
Shri Mataji: ... in the bowl.

1405
01:56:47,464 --> 01:56:54,227
¹²This is my commandment, That ye love
one another, as I have loved you.

1406
01:56:57,659 --> 01:57:00,619
¹³Greater love hath no man than this,

1407
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:05,522
that a man lay down his life for his
friends.

1408
01:57:05,723 --> 01:57:11,644
¹⁴Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever
I command you.

1409
01:57:12,804 --> 01:57:15,669
¹⁵Henceforth I call you not servants;

1410
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:19,674
for the servant knoweth not what his lord
doeth:

1411
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:22,220
but I have called you friends;

1412
01:57:22,421 --> 01:57:28,796
for all things that I have heard of my
Father I have made known unto you.

1413
01:57:41,769 --> 01:57:48,882
Shri Mataji: Rub it hard. Hard. Hm.
Very hard.

1414
01:57:49,083 --> 01:57:52,440
Yogi: ¹⁶Ye have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you,

1415
01:57:52,641 --> 01:57:56,897
and ordained you, that ye should go forth
and bring forth fruit,

1416
01:57:57,098 --> 01:58:01,286
and that your fruit should remain: that
whatsoever ye shall ask

1417
01:58:01,487 --> 01:58:05,629
of the Father in my name, he may give
it to you.

1418
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:09,848
¹⁷These things I command you, that ye love
one another.

1419
01:58:10,049 --> 01:58:14,360
¹⁸If the world hate you, ye know that it
hated me before it hated you.

1420
01:58:14,561 --> 01:58:17,633
Shri Mataji: Throughout one Commandment.
Just see. Because He knew

1421
01:58:17,834 --> 01:58:22,487
that if you don’t love each other, nobody
is going to believe you.

1422
01:58:23,226 --> 01:58:28,595
Yogi: ¹⁹If ye were of the world, the world
would love his own:

1423
01:58:28,806 --> 01:58:33,428
but because ye are not of the world, but
I have chosen you out of the world,

1424
01:58:33,636 --> 01:58:36,916
therefore the world hateth you.

1425
01:58:37,117 --> 01:58:39,832
²⁰Remember the word that I said unto you,

1426
01:58:40,033 --> 01:58:43,273
The servant is not greater than his lord.

1427
01:58:43,474 --> 01:58:48,205
If they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you;

1428
01:58:48,407 --> 01:58:53,569
if they have kept my saying, they will
keep yours also.

1429
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:58,524
²¹But all these things will they do unto
you for my name’s sake,

1430
01:58:58,744 --> 01:59:02,095
because they know not him that sent me.

1431
01:59:02,296 --> 01:59:08,932
²²If I had not come and spoken unto them,
they had not had sin…

1432
01:59:09,133 --> 01:59:13,201
Shri Mataji: They had…?
Yogi [repeats]: They had not had sin.

1433
01:59:13,402 --> 01:59:17,881
But now they have no cloak for their sin.

1434
01:59:18,406 --> 01:59:22,379
²³He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

1435
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:27,089
²⁴If I had not done among them the works
which none other man did,

1436
01:59:27,314 --> 01:59:34,795
they had not had sin: but now have they
both

1437
01:59:35,025 --> 01:59:39,160
seen and hated both me and my Father.

1438
01:59:39,361 --> 01:59:41,286
But this cometh to pass,

1439
01:59:41,487 --> 01:59:45,094
that the word might be fulfilled that
is written in their law,

1440
01:59:45,319 --> 01:59:53,217
They hated me without a cause.
Shri Mataji: See. Very true.

1441
01:59:53,649 --> 01:59:58,499
Yogi: ²⁶But when the Comforter is come,
whom I will send unto you from the Father,

1442
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:02,733
even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth
from the Father,

1443
02:00:02,933 --> 02:00:07,440
he shall testify of me:
Shri Mataji: Spirit of Truth is the point.

1444
02:00:07,649 --> 02:00:13,203
You see, you get the Spirit of Truth and
then testify, you can testify.

1445
02:00:13,404 --> 02:00:15,984
Yogi: ²⁷And ye also shall bear witness,

1446
02:00:16,185 --> 02:00:19,666
because ye have been with me from
the beginning.

1447
02:00:19,867 --> 02:00:22,863
Shri Mataji: From the very beginning.

1448
02:00:25,523 --> 02:00:28,601
Though in Hebrew it may not be he or she,
I think so.

1449
02:00:28,802 --> 02:00:34,440
Not sure, but you see, must be some sort
of a gender person.

1450
02:00:41,329 --> 02:00:45,061
Now stop your movement, just stop it.

1451
02:00:45,269 --> 02:00:52,947
Just keep it steady. Absolutely. Steady it.

1452
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:55,836
Yogi: ¹These things have I spoken unto you,
Shri Mataji: You still you are moving.

1453
02:00:56,036 --> 02:00:58,193
Yogi: that ye should not be offended.

1454
02:00:58,394 --> 02:01:02,204
²They shall put you out of the synagogues:
yea, the time cometh,

1455
02:01:02,405 --> 02:01:05,444
that whosoever killeth you will think that
he doeth God service.

1456
02:01:05,645 --> 02:01:08,232
[Shri Mataji: “Better. Put your hands
towards me.”] Yogi: ³And these things will

1457
02:01:08,433 --> 02:01:12,329
they do unto you, because they have not
known the Father, nor me.

1458
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:16,543
⁴But these things have I told you, that
when the time shall come,

1459
02:01:16,744 --> 02:01:19,277
ye may remember that I told you of them.
[Shri Mataji: “All right?”]

1460
02:01:19,478 --> 02:01:24,599
And these things I said not unto you at
the beginning, because I was with you.

1461
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,643
⁵But now I go my way to him that sent me;

1462
02:01:28,844 --> 02:01:32,298
and none of you asketh me, Whither
goest thou?

1463
02:01:32,499 --> 02:01:37,366
⁶But because I have said these things unto
you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

1464
02:01:37,567 --> 02:01:43,061
⁷Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is
expedient for you that I go away:

1465
02:01:43,269 --> 02:01:46,655
for if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come unto you;

1466
02:01:46,856 --> 02:01:50,032
but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

1467
02:01:50,233 --> 02:01:53,150
⁸And when he is come, he will reprove
the world of sin,

1468
02:01:53,351 --> 02:01:55,861
and of righteousness and of judgment.

1469
02:01:56,062 --> 02:01:59,539
⁹Of sin, because they believe not on me;
¹⁰Of righteousness…

1470
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:03,769
Shri Mataji: I think you stand up, and say,
you see, because people can’t hear you.

1471
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:06,875
See now how clearly, again, just read it.

1472
02:02:07,076 --> 02:02:09,291
How clear it is. What a nice chapter today.

1473
02:02:09,492 --> 02:02:14,223
Yogi: ⁷Nevertheless I tell you the truth;
It is expedient for you that I go away:

1474
02:02:14,424 --> 02:02:17,841
for if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come unto you;

1475
02:02:18,042 --> 02:02:21,420
but if I depart, I will send Her unto you.

1476
02:02:21,621 --> 02:02:24,710
⁸And when She is come, She will reprove
the world of sin,

1477
02:02:24,911 --> 02:02:27,869
and of righteousness and of judgment:

1478
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:30,422
⁹Of sin, because they believe not on me;

1479
02:02:30,623 --> 02:02:34,862
¹⁰Of righteousness, because I go to my
Father, and ye see me no more;

1480
02:02:35,063 --> 02:02:38,946
¹¹Of judgment, because the prince of this
world is judged.

1481
02:02:39,147 --> 02:02:43,523
¹²I have yet many things to say unto you,
but ye cannot hear (bear) them now.

1482
02:02:43,724 --> 02:02:46,194
Howbeit when She, the Spirit of truth,
is come,

1483
02:02:46,395 --> 02:02:51,754
She will guide you into all truth: for She
shall not speak (of) himself;

1484
02:02:51,955 --> 02:02:56,981
but whatsoever She shall hear, that shall
She speak:

1485
02:02:57,182 --> 02:03:01,740
and She will shew you things to come.
Shri Mataji: Whatsoever She saw.

1486
02:03:01,948 --> 02:03:03,725
Yogi (repeats): … and SHE will shew you
things to come.

1487
02:03:03,926 --> 02:03:08,469
Shri Mataji: No, before this sentence,
what is it?

1488
02:03:09,986 --> 02:03:13,124
Yogi (repeats): ¹³Howbeit when Her,
the Spirit of truth, is come,

1489
02:03:13,359 --> 02:03:17,961
She will guide you into all truth: for She
shall not speak of Herself;

1490
02:03:18,162 --> 02:03:25,808
but whatsoever She shall hear, that
shall She speak:

1491
02:03:26,009 --> 02:03:28,513
and She will shew you things to come.

1492
02:03:28,714 --> 02:03:31,867
¹⁴She shall glorify me: for She shall
receive of mine,

1493
02:03:32,068 --> 02:03:34,347
and shall shew it unto you.

1494
02:03:34,548 --> 02:03:38,410
¹⁵All things that the Father hath are mine:
therefore said I,

1495
02:03:38,611 --> 02:03:42,805
that She shall take of mine, and shall
shew it unto you.

1496
02:03:43,006 --> 02:03:46,198
¹⁶A little while, and ye shall not see me:
and again, a little while,

1497
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:50,064
and ye shall see me, because I go
to the Father.

1498
02:03:54,039 --> 02:03:58,644
Shri Mataji: Now better? Yes, better.

1499
02:04:03,135 --> 02:04:07,422
Better now? Just see on his head. Are
you alright?

1500
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:12,420
He is alright. Alright. Now.

1501
02:04:13,261 --> 02:04:16,246
May God bless you.

1502
02:04:18,144 --> 02:04:23,986
Other yogi: ¹⁷Then said some of his
disciples among themselves,

1503
02:04:24,187 --> 02:04:27,577
What is this that he saith unto thee,

1504
02:04:27,777 --> 02:04:31,372
What is this that he saith unto us,

1505
02:04:31,573 --> 02:04:36,131
A little while, and ye shall not see me:

1506
02:04:36,332 --> 02:04:42,662
and again, a little while, and ye shall
see me:

1507
02:04:42,863 --> 02:04:47,170
(and), Because I go unto the Father?

1508
02:04:47,371 --> 02:04:54,042
¹⁸They said therefore, What is this that
he saith, A little while?

1509
02:04:54,243 --> 02:04:58,355
He cannot tell what he saith.

1510
02:04:58,556 --> 02:05:06,594
¹⁹Now Jesus knew that they were desirous
to ask him, and said unto them,

1511
02:05:06,797 --> 02:05:11,657
Do ye inquire among yourselves of that
I said,

1512
02:05:11,858 --> 02:05:15,488
 A little while, and ye shall not see me:

1513
02:05:15,689 --> 02:05:22,357
and again, a little while, and ye shall
see me?

1514
02:05:22,616 --> 02:05:30,117
²⁰Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye
shall weep and lament,

1515
02:05:30,318 --> 02:05:36,279
but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall
be sorrowful,

1516
02:05:36,574 --> 02:05:42,554
but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

1517
02:05:42,755 --> 02:05:47,370
²¹A woman when she is in travail hath
sorrow,

1518
02:05:47,571 --> 02:05:50,596
because her hour is come:

1519
02:05:50,797 --> 02:05:55,235
but as soon as she is delivered
of the child,

1520
02:05:55,436 --> 02:06:00,105
she remembereth no more the anguish,

1521
02:06:00,306 --> 02:06:06,105
for joy that a man is born unto the world.

1522
02:06:06,306 --> 02:06:13,069
²²And ye now therefore - and ye now
therefore have sorrow:

1523
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:20,830
but I will see, but I will see you again,
and your heart shall rejoice,

1524
02:06:21,046 --> 02:06:25,194
and your joy no man taketh from you.

1525
02:06:25,395 --> 02:06:29,931
²³And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.

1526
02:06:30,132 --> 02:06:35,532
Shri Mataji: In that day, you see? You
shall ask me nothing.

1527
02:06:39,453 --> 02:06:44,074
Yogi: Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Whatsoever ye shall ask

1528
02:06:44,275 --> 02:06:49,731
the Father in my name, he shall give
it you.

1529
02:06:49,932 --> 02:06:53,678
²⁴Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my
name:

1530
02:06:53,879 --> 02:07:01,173
ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy
may be full.

1531
02:07:01,374 --> 02:07:05,039
²⁵These things have I spoken unto you
in proverbs:

1532
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:11,112
but the time cometh, when I shall no more
speak unto you in proverbs,

1533
02:07:11,313 --> 02:07:16,225
but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.

1534
02:07:16,426 --> 02:07:19,849
²⁶At that time of day ye shall ask in my
name:

1535
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:27,370
and I say not unto you, that I will pray
the Father for you:

1536
02:07:27,571 --> 02:07:32,806
²⁷For the Father himself loveth you,
because ye have loved me,

1537
02:07:33,007 --> 02:07:37,780
and have believed that I came from God.

1538
02:07:37,981 --> 02:07:43,810
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Now what more
you want? Said everything!

1539
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:52,652
Read the Resurrection part, somewhere.

1540
02:07:55,287 --> 02:08:01,064
All right. First here make…

1541
02:08:02,104 --> 02:08:07,846
this side. Did you tell?

1542
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:11,408
Good. Here.

1543
02:08:30,494 --> 02:08:33,884
Now put your hands towards me.

1544
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:44,251
All right? Good.

1545
02:08:46,979 --> 02:08:56,150
Now. Can we – I was thinking – all right,

1546
02:08:56,426 --> 02:09:00,678
for Mandy and Magda,

1547
02:09:01,465 --> 02:09:05,317
you can come and wash my hands.

1548
02:09:17,537 --> 02:09:20,843
Ken, one of the things.

1549
02:09:25,963 --> 02:09:29,509
If you can bring a bucket or something
you can put on that…

1550
02:09:29,725 --> 02:09:34,099
Yogi: [John, 19.41] ⁴¹Now in the place
where he was crucified there was a garden;

1551
02:09:34,334 --> 02:09:40,327
and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein
was never man yet laid.

1552
02:09:40,528 --> 02:09:45,476
⁴²There laid they Jesus therefore because
of the Jews’ preparation day;

1553
02:09:45,751 --> 02:09:49,983
or the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

1554
02:09:50,184 --> 02:09:54,368
¹The first day of the week cometh Mary
Magdalene early,

1555
02:09:54,569 --> 02:09:57,412
when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre,

1556
02:09:57,613 --> 02:10:01,131
seeth the stone taken away from
the sepulchre.

1557
02:10:01,332 --> 02:10:05,157
[Shri Mataji: “Get a bucket or something”.]
Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter,

1558
02:10:05,358 --> 02:10:10,099
and to the other disciple, whom Jesus
loved, and saith unto them,

1559
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:13,055
They have taken away the Lord out
of the sepulchre,

1560
02:10:13,256 --> 02:10:16,193
and we do not know where they have laid
him. [Shri Mataji: “Some bucket”.]

1561
02:10:16,394 --> 02:10:21,747
³Peter therefore went forth, and that other
disciple, and came to the sepulchre.

1562
02:10:21,948 --> 02:10:26,450
⁴So they ran both together: and the other
disciple did outrun Peter,

1563
02:10:26,651 --> 02:10:29,303
and came first to the sepulchre.

1564
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:35,046
⁵And he stooping down, and looking in,
saw the linen clothes lying;

1565
02:10:35,247 --> 02:10:37,135
yet went he not in.

1566
02:10:37,336 --> 02:10:40,021
⁶Then cometh Simon Peter following him,

1567
02:10:40,222 --> 02:10:44,811
and went into the sepulchre, and seeth
the linen clothes lie,

1568
02:10:45,012 --> 02:10:49,642
⁷And the napkin, that was about his head,
not lying with the linen clothes,

1569
02:10:49,843 --> 02:10:53,273
but wrapped together in a place by itself.

1570
02:10:53,474 --> 02:10:55,632
⁸Then went in also that other disciple,

1571
02:10:55,833 --> 02:11:00,039
which came first to the sepulchre, and he
saw, and believed.

1572
02:11:00,242 --> 02:11:05,571
⁹For as yet they knew not the scripture,
that he must rise again from the dead.

1573
02:11:05,772 --> 02:11:11,346
¹⁰Then the disciples went away again
unto their own home.

1574
02:11:11,547 --> 02:11:14,985
¹¹But Mary stood without at the sepulchre
weeping:

1575
02:11:15,186 --> 02:11:19,487
and as she wept, she stooped down, and
looked into the sepulchre,

1576
02:11:19,688 --> 02:11:22,592
¹²And seeth two angels in white sitting,

1577
02:11:22,793 --> 02:11:25,347
the one at the head, and the other
at the feet,

1578
02:11:25,548 --> 02:11:28,287
where the body of Jesus had lain.

1579
02:11:28,488 --> 02:11:33,093
¹³And they say unto her, Woman, why
weepest thou?

1580
02:11:33,294 --> 02:11:37,367
She saith unto them, Because they have
taken away my Lord,

1581
02:11:37,568 --> 02:11:40,672
and I know not where they have laid him.

1582
02:11:40,873 --> 02:11:44,501
¹⁴And when she had thus said, she
turned herself back,

1583
02:11:44,702 --> 02:11:50,277
and saw Jesus standing, and knew not
that it was Jesus.

1584
02:11:50,478 --> 02:11:53,914
¹⁵Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why
weepest thou?

1585
02:11:54,125 --> 02:11:56,554
Whom seekest thou?

1586
02:11:56,755 --> 02:12:00,517
She, supposing him to be the gardener,
saith unto him,

1587
02:12:00,721 --> 02:12:06,232
Sir, if thou have borne him hence, take
(tell) me where thou hast laid him,

1588
02:12:06,432 --> 02:12:09,300
and I will take him away.

1589
02:12:09,501 --> 02:12:12,766
¹⁶Jesus saith unto her, Mary.

1590
02:12:12,967 --> 02:12:20,822
She turned herself, and saith unto him,
Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

1591
02:12:21,023 --> 02:12:24,162
Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not;

1592
02:12:24,363 --> 02:12:27,516
for I am not yet ascended to my Father:

1593
02:12:27,717 --> 02:12:30,807
but go to my brethren, and say unto them,

1594
02:12:31,008 --> 02:12:34,376
I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;

1595
02:12:34,577 --> 02:12:39,056
and to my God, and your God.

1596
02:12:48,357 --> 02:12:52,246
Shri Mataji: Left is catching. Just rub
this left foot.

1597
02:12:52,446 --> 02:12:56,625
Rub it. Just rub the left. All right.

1598
02:12:56,865 --> 02:13:04,585
See, these two, two fingers up here, see,
Vishuddhi and Agnya. Rub it hard.

1599
02:13:13,797 --> 02:13:18,564
Other yogi: ¹⁸Mary Magdalene came and told
the disciples that she had seen the Lord,

1600
02:13:18,765 --> 02:13:22,912
and that he had spoken these things
unto her.

1601
02:13:23,113 --> 02:13:27,255
¹⁹Then the same day at evening, being
the first day of the week,

1602
02:13:27,456 --> 02:13:30,449
when the doors were shut where
the disciples were assembled

1603
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:34,761
for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood
in the midst,

1604
02:13:34,962 --> 02:13:39,155
and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

1605
02:13:39,356 --> 02:13:46,016
²⁰And when he had so said, he shewed
unto them his hands and his side.

1606
02:13:46,217 --> 02:13:50,886
Then were the disciples glad, when they
saw the Lord.

1607
02:13:51,087 --> 02:13:54,899
²¹Then said Jesus to them again,
Peace be unto you:

1608
02:13:55,100 --> 02:14:00,182
as my Father hath sent me, even so
send I you.

1609
02:14:00,383 --> 02:14:04,210
²²And when he had said this, he breathed
on them,

1610
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:09,780
and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost:

1611
02:14:09,981 --> 02:14:15,475
²³Whose soever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them;

1612
02:14:15,676 --> 02:14:20,941
and whose soever sins ye retain, they
are retained.

1613
02:14:21,142 --> 02:14:25,629
²⁴But Thomas, one of the twelve, called
Didymus,

1614
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:29,189
was not with them when Jesus came.

1615
02:14:29,390 --> 02:14:34,147
²⁵The other disciples therefore said unto
him, We have seen the Lord.

1616
02:14:34,348 --> 02:14:40,280
But he said unto them, Except I shall see
in his hands the print of the nails,

1617
02:14:40,481 --> 02:14:43,031
and put my finger into the print
of the nails,

1618
02:14:43,232 --> 02:14:47,861
and thrust my hand into his side, I will
not believe.

1619
02:14:48,062 --> 02:14:52,222
²⁶And after eight days again his disciples
were within,

1620
02:14:52,423 --> 02:14:58,203
and Thomas with them: then came Jesus,
the doors being shut,

1621
02:14:58,404 --> 02:15:02,572
and stood in the midst, and said, Peace
be unto you.

1622
02:15:02,773 --> 02:15:09,132
²⁷Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither
thy finger, and behold my hands;

1623
02:15:09,333 --> 02:15:13,935
and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it
into my side:

1624
02:15:14,136 --> 02:15:17,327
and be not faithless, but believing.

1625
02:15:17,528 --> 02:15:23,431
²⁸And Thomas answered and said unto him,
My Lord and my God.

1626
02:15:23,632 --> 02:15:30,494
²⁹Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because
thou hast seen me, thou hast believed:

1627
02:15:30,695 --> 02:15:35,298
blessed are they that have not seen,
and yet have believed.

1628
02:15:35,499 --> 02:15:39,978
³⁰And many other signs truly did Jesus
in the presence of his disciples,

1629
02:15:40,179 --> 02:15:43,993
which are not written in this book:
³¹But these are written,

1630
02:15:44,194 --> 02:15:48,730
that ye might believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of God;

1631
02:15:48,931 --> 02:15:53,387
and that believing ye might have life
through his name.

1632
02:15:53,587 --> 02:15:57,685
Shri Mataji: He tried to awaken their
Kundalini.

1633
02:15:59,663 --> 02:16:03,902
It’s not written in this book; I wish they
had written.

1634
02:16:04,103 --> 02:16:07,152
Many Christians would have been saved.

1635
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:11,946
All right. So better? Wash my hands.

1636
02:16:13,636 --> 02:16:21,737
Yes, two for one hand. Wash it. Hard.
Hold the another one.

1637
02:16:24,894 --> 02:16:28,854
Yogini: After these things Jesus shewed
himself again to the disciples at the sea …

1638
02:16:29,055 --> 02:16:33,508
Shri Mataji: Stand up and read loudly,
I can’t hear you.

1639
02:16:35,350 --> 02:16:37,898
Yogini: ¹After these things Jesus shewed
himself again

1640
02:16:38,098 --> 02:16:41,160
to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias;

1641
02:16:41,376 --> 02:16:44,349
and on this wise shewed he himself.

1642
02:16:44,614 --> 02:16:48,831
²There were together Simon Peter, and
Thomas called Didymus,

1643
02:16:49,032 --> 02:16:52,346
and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,

1644
02:16:52,547 --> 02:16:57,086
and the sons of Zebedee, and two other
of his disciples.

1645
02:16:57,286 --> 02:17:00,732
³Simon Peter saith unto them, I g
 a fishing.

1646
02:17:00,962 --> 02:17:03,972
They say unto him, We also go with thee.

1647
02:17:04,173 --> 02:17:07,852
They went forth, and entered into a ship
immediately;

1648
02:17:08,053 --> 02:17:11,038
and that night they caught nothing.

1649
02:17:11,239 --> 02:17:14,789
⁴But when the morning was now come,
Jesus stood on the shore:

1650
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:18,776
but the disciples knew not that it was
Jesus.

1651
02:17:18,977 --> 02:17:23,114
⁵Then Jesus saith unto them, Children,
have ye any meat?

1652
02:17:23,315 --> 02:17:26,999
They answered him, No. ⁶And he said
unto them,

1653
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:32,557
Cast the net on the right side of the ship,
and ye shall find. They cast therefore,

1654
02:17:32,758 --> 02:17:36,928
and now they were not able to draw it
for the multitude of fishes.

1655
02:17:37,129 --> 02:17:40,997
⁷Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved
saith unto Peter,

1656
02:17:41,198 --> 02:17:46,096
It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard
that it was the Lord,

1657
02:17:46,297 --> 02:17:49,768
he girt his fisher’s coat unto him,
(for he was naked,)

1658
02:17:49,969 --> 02:17:53,081
and did cast himself into the sea.

1659
02:17:53,282 --> 02:17:57,006
⁸And the other disciples came in a little
ship;

1660
02:17:57,207 --> 02:18:01,037
(for they were not far from land, but as it
were two hundred cubits,)

1661
02:18:01,238 --> 02:18:04,052
dragging the net with fishes.

1662
02:18:04,253 --> 02:18:09,400
⁹As soon then as they were come to
the land, they saw a fire of coals there,

1663
02:18:09,601 --> 02:18:14,159
and fish laid thereon, and bread. ¹⁰Jesus
saith unto them,

1664
02:18:14,494 --> 02:18:17,433
Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.

1665
02:18:17,634 --> 02:18:20,909
¹¹Simon Peter went up, and drew the net
to land

1666
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:24,599
full of great fishes, an hundred and
fifty-three:

1667
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:30,289
and for all there were so many, yet was
not the net broken.

1668
02:18:30,490 --> 02:18:33,456
¹²Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine.

1669
02:18:33,657 --> 02:18:37,023
And none of the disciples durst ask him,
Who art thou?

1670
02:18:37,224 --> 02:18:39,614
knowing that it was the Lord.

1671
02:18:39,815 --> 02:18:45,144
¹³Jesus then cometh, and taketh the bread,
and giveth them, and fish likewise.

1672
02:18:45,345 --> 02:18:49,322
¹⁴This is now the third time that Jesus
shewed himself to his disciples,

1673
02:18:49,523 --> 02:18:53,097
after that he was risen from the dead.

1674
02:18:53,298 --> 02:18:57,292
¹⁵So when they had dined, Jesus saith
to Simon Peter,

1675
02:18:57,493 --> 02:19:01,309
Simon, son of Jonas… Simon, son of Jonas

1676
02:19:01,510 --> 02:19:05,015
lovest thou me more than these? He saith
unto him, Yea, Lord;…

1677
02:19:05,216 --> 02:19:08,764
Shri Mataji: See the vibrations, are better
now. Yogini: …thou knowest that I love thee.

1678
02:19:08,965 --> 02:19:13,362
He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
Shri Mataji: We’ll give something else…

1679
02:19:13,578 --> 02:19:19,328
¹⁶He saith to him again the second time,
Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

1680
02:19:19,529 --> 02:19:23,735
He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
that I love thee.

1681
02:19:23,936 --> 02:19:27,246
He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

1682
02:19:27,447 --> 02:19:32,713
¹⁷He saith unto him the third time, Simon,
son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

1683
02:19:32,932 --> 02:19:37,537
Peter was grieved because he said unto him
the third time, Lovest thou me?

1684
02:19:37,738 --> 02:19:40,949
And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
all these things;

1685
02:19:41,149 --> 02:19:48,218
thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith
unto him, Feed my sheep.

1686
02:19:48,419 --> 02:19:53,086
¹⁸Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When
thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself,

1687
02:19:53,287 --> 02:19:57,601
and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but
when thou shalt be old,

1688
02:19:57,801 --> 02:20:01,502
thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
another shall gird thee,

1689
02:20:01,702 --> 02:20:04,621
and carry thee whither thou wouldest
not go.

1690
02:20:04,822 --> 02:20:09,991
¹⁹This spake he, signifying by what death
he should glorify God.

1691
02:20:10,192 --> 02:20:15,004
And when he had spoken this, he saith
unto him, Follow me.

1692
02:20:15,228 --> 02:20:20,374
²⁰Then Peter, turning about, seeth
the disciple whom Jesus loved following;

1693
02:20:20,575 --> 02:20:24,396
which also leaned on his breast at supper,
and said,

1694
02:20:24,597 --> 02:20:28,202
Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?

1695
02:20:28,403 --> 02:20:33,540
²¹Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord,
and what shall this man do?

1696
02:20:33,741 --> 02:20:39,196
²²Jesus saith unto him, If I will
[Shri Mataji: “Honey”…]

1697
02:20:39,397 --> 02:20:41,817
that he tarry till I come, what is that
to thee?

1698
02:20:42,018 --> 02:20:44,832
[Shri Mataji: Honey, honey… honey.]
Yogini: Follow thou me.

1699
02:20:45,033 --> 02:20:47,735
²³Then went this saying abroad among
the brethren,

1700
02:20:47,936 --> 02:20:51,290
that that disciple should not die:

1701
02:20:51,491 --> 02:20:55,667
yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
not die;

1702
02:20:55,868 --> 02:21:00,884
If I will that he tarry till I come, what
is that to thee?

1703
02:21:01,119 --> 02:21:06,124
²⁴This is the disciple which testifieth
of these things, and wrote these things:

1704
02:21:06,325 --> 02:21:09,850
and we know that his testimony is true.

1705
02:21:10,051 --> 02:21:12,677
²⁵And there are also many other things
which Jesus did,

1706
02:21:12,878 --> 02:21:18,434
the which, if they should be written every
one, I suppose that even the world itself

1707
02:21:18,635 --> 02:21:21,934
could not contain the books that shall
(should) be written.

1708
02:21:22,159 --> 02:21:24,288
Shri Mataji: Ah, you see, He said that,
“Thou shalt not die.”

1709
02:21:24,489 --> 02:21:29,055
What does that mean? Nobody dies, isn’t it?

1710
02:21:29,256 --> 02:21:34,200
And that you’ll be revived, you’ll have
an Eternal Life!

1711
02:22:23,092 --> 02:22:28,813
Good. Now …

1712
02:22:29,014 --> 02:22:32,097
that should do.

1713
02:22:45,049 --> 02:22:48,324
Just pour it.

1714
02:22:50,848 --> 02:22:56,405
Yes. Is it over?

1715
02:23:00,709 --> 02:23:06,378
You didn’t show - read the Resurrection
itself.

1716
02:23:21,128 --> 02:23:24,873
... you should pour some honey also,
pour something.

1717
02:23:25,074 --> 02:23:29,253
Better. Honey is there.

1718
02:23:31,503 --> 02:23:34,392
Pour all that.

1719
02:23:41,204 --> 02:23:44,789
It’s good. That will do.

1720
02:23:44,990 --> 02:23:49,939
Now. More milk.

1721
02:23:51,430 --> 02:23:54,772
More milk.

1722
02:23:56,513 --> 02:23:59,532
Gavin? [Gavin: “Yes, Mother”]

1723
02:24:12,468 --> 02:24:15,659
More milk.

1724
02:24:41,593 --> 02:24:44,563
Good.

1725
02:25:05,657 --> 02:25:07,646
Gavin: [John 20: 19-23] 36And as they thus
spake, Jesus himself

1726
02:25:07,847 --> 02:25:13,302
stood in the midst of them, and saith unto
them, Peace be unto you.

1727
02:25:13,503 --> 02:25:18,266
³⁷But they were terrified and affrighted,
and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

1728
02:25:18,467 --> 02:25:21,034
³⁸And he said unto them, Why are ye
troubled?

1729
02:25:21,235 --> 02:25:24,704
and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

1730
02:25:24,905 --> 02:25:29,805
³⁹Behold my hands and my feet, that it is
I myself:

1731
02:25:30,006 --> 02:25:35,387
handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

1732
02:25:35,588 --> 02:25:38,367
Shri Mataji: That’s it!

1733
02:25:38,568 --> 02:25:43,570
Gavin: ⁴⁰And when he had thus spoken,
he shewed them his hands and his feet.

1734
02:25:43,771 --> 02:25:47,038
⁴¹And while they yet believed not for joy,
and wondered,

1735
02:25:47,238 --> 02:25:52,082
he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?

1736
02:25:52,282 --> 02:25:56,759
⁴²And they gave him a piece of a broiled
fish, and of an honeycomb.

1737
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:01,556
⁴³And he took it, and did eat before them.

1738
02:26:02,044 --> 02:26:06,968
⁴⁴And he said unto them, These are
the words which I spake unto you,

1739
02:26:07,169 --> 02:26:10,946
while I was yet with you, that all things
must be fulfilled,

1740
02:26:11,146 --> 02:26:14,385
which were written in the law of Moses,
and in the prophets,

1741
02:26:14,585 --> 02:26:18,934
and in the psalms, concerning me.

1742
02:26:19,351 --> 02:26:26,055
⁴⁵Then opened he their understanding,
that they might understand the scriptures,

1743
02:26:26,255 --> 02:26:29,059
⁴⁶And said unto them, Thus it is written,

1744
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:31,884
and thus it behoved Christ to suffer,

1745
02:26:32,085 --> 02:26:36,730
and to rise from the dead the third day:

1746
02:26:36,933 --> 02:26:40,515
⁴⁷And that repentance and remission
of sins should be preached

1747
02:26:40,715 --> 02:26:46,885
in his name among all nations, beginning
at Jerusalem.

1748
02:26:47,086 --> 02:26:51,246
⁴⁸And ye are witnesses of these things.

1749
02:26:51,447 --> 02:26:54,713
⁴⁹And, behold, I send the promise of my
Father upon you…

1750
02:26:54,914 --> 02:27:00,509
Shri Mataji: Behold? Gavin: ... I send
the promise of my Father upon you:

1751
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:03,507
but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,

1752
02:27:03,708 --> 02:27:06,893
until ye be endued with power from on high.

1753
02:27:07,093 --> 02:27:12,033
Shri Mataji: Just read this one:
“I’ll tarry you…”.

1754
02:27:12,234 --> 02:27:15,954
Gavin: I’ll tarry you in the city of Jerusalem,
Shri Mataji: I’ll have some more water.

1755
02:27:16,155 --> 02:27:19,749
Gavin: until ye be endued with power
from on high.

1756
02:27:19,950 --> 02:27:25,098
Shri Mataji: Again, please. I didn’t follow
every word.

1757
02:27:25,299 --> 02:27:28,632
“I will tarry you…”. Yes.

1758
02:27:28,833 --> 02:27:32,121
Gavin [repeats:] Behold, I send the promise
of my Father upon you:

1759
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:35,729
but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,

1760
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:40,515
until ye be endued with power from on high.

1761
02:27:40,716 --> 02:27:43,351
Shri Mataji: See?

1762
02:27:47,526 --> 02:27:50,203
Gavin: And he led them out as far
as to Bethany,

1763
02:27:50,404 --> 02:27:54,966
and he lifted up his hands, and blessed
them.

1764
02:27:55,167 --> 02:27:58,962
⁵¹And it came to pass, while he blessed
them, he was parted from them,

1765
02:27:59,163 --> 02:28:02,075
and carried up into heaven.

1766
02:28:02,276 --> 02:28:07,224
⁵²And they worshipped him, and returned
to Jerusalem with great joy:

1767
02:28:07,425 --> 02:28:13,144
⁵³And were continually in the temple,
praising and blessing God.

1768
02:28:14,747 --> 02:28:21,706
Shri Mataji: It’s promised! I’ve said it
many-a-times, you are promised!

1769
02:28:23,858 --> 02:28:26,844
Very good.

1770
02:29:14,589 --> 02:29:19,042
How I think should we do -

1771
02:29:19,243 --> 02:29:24,590
we’ll have food and then have havan?
What is it?

1772
02:29:27,194 --> 02:29:29,848
Is food ready or…

1773
02:29:30,049 --> 02:29:33,598
We can have havan and then have the food,
whichever way you see.

1774
02:29:33,799 --> 02:29:38,512
I’m free tonight, for the whole night.

1775
02:29:42,077 --> 02:29:45,885
Whatever you say. Why this?

1776
02:29:46,086 --> 02:29:51,048
Gavin: Mother, for this puja we don’t give
You a sari.

1777
02:29:51,249 --> 02:29:55,197
Shri Mataji: Oh, good.
Gavin: We give You something more symbolic.

1778
02:29:55,398 --> 02:30:00,140
Shri Mataji: That’s good. May God
bless you.

1779
02:30:12,907 --> 02:30:18,898
Beautiful. Can I open?

1780
02:30:32,351 --> 02:30:34,954
Beautiful.

1781
02:31:16,293 --> 02:31:19,357
[Somebody: “Can you help?”

1782
02:31:24,087 --> 02:31:28,961
A yogini: “Comes off, Mother…”].
Gavin: What a granthi!

1783
02:31:40,375 --> 02:31:43,853
Shri Mataji: Really beautiful, Gavin.

1784
02:31:44,068 --> 02:31:47,292
Really beautiful.

1785
02:31:48,819 --> 02:31:53,877
What’s in there? Gavin?

1786
02:31:54,175 --> 02:31:59,597
That’s not good, that’s too much.

1787
02:32:09,308 --> 02:32:13,065
I don’t know how you could think of all
these things, this is too much.

1788
02:32:13,266 --> 02:32:17,355
Yogini: Mother? Mother? It’s a real egg.
Shri Mataji: It’s a real egg.

1789
02:32:17,556 --> 02:32:20,905
Yogini: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: I know, I could feel the -

1790
02:32:21,106 --> 02:32:26,240
could feel it. Must be duck’s egg.
Or something.

1791
02:32:26,441 --> 02:32:29,127
Or something. It’s very big, eh?
Some yogis: Goose.

1792
02:32:29,327 --> 02:32:31,611
Yogini: It’s a goose egg.
Shri Mataji: Hm?

1793
02:32:31,812 --> 02:32:34,961
Yogini: Goose egg.
Shri Mataji: Goose egg.

1794
02:32:36,473 --> 02:32:39,362
Very well done.

1795
02:32:41,654 --> 02:32:44,290
Good. All right. And this one is? [A ring]

1796
02:32:44,491 --> 02:32:47,598
It’s too much, Gavin, it’s too much.

1797
02:32:47,799 --> 02:32:50,716
Very beautiful.

1798
02:32:52,562 --> 02:32:55,303
Thank you.

1799
02:32:55,504 --> 02:32:58,368
Gavin and yogis: Jai Mataji.

1800
02:33:00,363 --> 02:33:03,054
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much,
thank you.

1801
02:33:03,255 --> 02:33:05,661
It’s so beautiful, you can’t imagine.
Very beautiful.

1802
02:33:05,868 --> 02:33:11,857
It has that pradakshina round the Spirit.

1803
02:33:12,058 --> 02:33:16,068
See? It’s beautiful. What a choice,
it's a beauty.

1804
02:33:16,269 --> 02:33:20,021
We shouldn’t spend money on gold.

1805
02:33:22,711 --> 02:33:25,241
It’s beautiful.

1806
02:33:29,622 --> 02:33:34,265
It’s too much, you shouldn’t give
so expensive things to me.

1807
02:33:34,466 --> 02:33:37,752
Where did you get this egg?

1808
02:33:39,198 --> 02:33:42,004
Real beauty I think.

1809
02:33:43,036 --> 02:33:46,135
It’s quite an antique.

1810
02:33:47,199 --> 02:33:51,360
Could you do it carefully, again,
tie it up.

1811
02:33:55,868 --> 02:33:58,360
What an idea.

1812
02:33:59,234 --> 02:34:03,698
I wish the egg that walks becomes
like this,

1813
02:34:03,899 --> 02:34:09,062
all adorned, with all the beauty.

1814
02:34:09,286 --> 02:34:12,169
All the precious things.

1815
02:34:13,615 --> 02:34:18,288
Yes? You brought this for me?

1816
02:34:19,207 --> 02:34:22,847
Hello, what’s that? This is what? This is
what you’ve got?

1817
02:34:23,047 --> 02:34:30,326
Eh? What’s this for? Now what is there?
This.

1818
02:34:30,732 --> 02:34:36,221
Hm?  It’s flower? This is - flower?

1819
02:34:41,818 --> 02:34:46,527
What happened? You’ve been crying!

1820
02:34:49,907 --> 02:34:52,597
Don’t cry.

1821
02:34:54,045 --> 02:34:58,911
Did you see this one is? What’s that?

1822
02:34:59,240 --> 02:35:03,593
She is becoming a farmer or what?

1823
02:35:05,278 --> 02:35:07,940
See this flower.

1824
02:35:09,861 --> 02:35:12,250
Good?

1825
02:35:27,189 --> 02:35:29,682
Nice.

1826
02:35:36,885 --> 02:35:39,861
So what about chana?

1827
02:35:44,151 --> 02:35:46,628
Now what’s that?

1828
02:35:47,210 --> 02:35:50,338
She is getting taller!

1829
02:35:51,795 --> 02:35:56,142
So now, what is the programme, next?
Is - what about dinner?

1830
02:35:56,343 --> 02:36:03,134
Or should we have the puja first? Who is
the in-charge?

1831
02:36:06,089 --> 02:36:11,094
I was saying that Nick should be in charge
of this place

1832
02:36:11,297 --> 02:36:14,307
and Norman should assist him,

1833
02:36:14,508 --> 02:36:18,224
and they should form all the rules and
regulations of this place.

1834
02:36:18,425 --> 02:36:22,832
And when Harry comes, his wife will look
after the cooking side of it,

1835
02:36:23,033 --> 02:36:26,295
and the cleanliness of the place, because
she’ll stay at home,

1836
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:30,467
and Harry will look after the Puja part.

1837
02:36:34,031 --> 02:36:36,260
I think to the other ashram also, whatever
is needed

1838
02:36:36,461 --> 02:36:42,307
you must do the needful, make it
a comfortable place.

1839
02:36:58,909 --> 02:37:06,505
And, any other problems with this place?
You have got sufficient

1840
02:37:06,706 --> 02:37:15,813
rugs and carpets to spread here? Nick?

1841
02:37:16,014 --> 02:37:18,893
Nick: We have about fourteen, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Hm?

1842
02:37:19,094 --> 02:37:22,516
Nick: We have about fourteen carpets…
Shri Mataji: Forty carpets.

1843
02:37:22,716 --> 02:37:25,756
Nick: Fourteen, that You bought for us.
Yogini: Fourteen.

1844
02:37:25,957 --> 02:37:28,497
Shri Mataji: Forty. Yogini: Fourteen.
Shri Mataji: Fourteen. Yogini: Yes.

1845
02:37:28,706 --> 02:37:31,443
Yogi: It’s all the carpets You bought
for us… (inaudible), Mother.

1846
02:37:31,644 --> 02:37:39,534
Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s true, but what
about for people in the bedrooms,

1847
02:37:39,735 --> 02:37:43,324
are they all right for them or they need
something more?

1848
02:37:43,525 --> 02:37:48,790
Yogi: I think there are a few, Mother, that
still need some flooring. Shri Mataji: Hm?

1849
02:37:48,991 --> 02:37:52,169
Yogi: There are some rooms that still need
carpets, Mother.

1850
02:37:52,370 --> 02:37:54,987
Shri Mataji: They have parquet.

1851
02:37:55,188 --> 02:38:01,197
But maybe you might need some - these
carpets you brought, the other ones,

1852
02:38:01,398 --> 02:38:04,417
door-to-door ones, have you spread them
somewhere?

1853
02:38:04,618 --> 02:38:07,453
Yogi: Some of them, Mother. Most of them
come in this area, here.

1854
02:38:07,654 --> 02:38:13,286
Shri Mataji: Area, hm. Yes.

1855
02:38:14,537 --> 02:38:19,560
Do you know, these are little small for
the bedrooms, I think.

1856
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:25,299
If there’s any need of anything you should
let us know,

1857
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:30,256
but you must keep some rooms vacant for
the guests who are coming here. All right?

1858
02:38:30,457 --> 02:38:32,535
Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Some rooms must be kept.

1859
02:38:32,736 --> 02:38:35,774
Norman, you would just go and see what
you would like to keep some of them,

1860
02:38:35,975 --> 02:38:40,848
comfortable ones, for the guests who come
from anywhere else?

1861
02:38:41,049 --> 02:38:47,290
And what about the food arrangements,
are all right?

1862
02:38:47,490 --> 02:38:49,988
Yogi: No, I think this is being sorted out
now, Mother.

1863
02:38:50,189 --> 02:38:53,165
Shri Mataji: Hm?
Yogi: We are sorting this out now, Mother…

1864
02:38:53,366 --> 02:38:57,163
Shri Mataji: What about the gas, gas
connection?

1865
02:38:57,364 --> 02:39:01,681
Yogi: Gas is on, Mother. Other yogi:
It’s on, Mother. Shri Mataji: It’s on.

1866
02:39:02,603 --> 02:39:06,719
I mean, if you need, let me know.

1867
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:09,575
I don’t know what are your needs, it’s such
a huge thing

1868
02:39:09,775 --> 02:39:15,273
that I can’t make out what you need and
what you want.

1869
02:39:23,441 --> 02:39:26,578
Is done very well, I should say.

1870
02:39:29,333 --> 02:39:33,244
Agnya is done very well and all these
things.

1871
02:39:42,036 --> 02:39:48,390
Now what’s that? It’s a cake! All right.

1872
02:39:48,591 --> 02:39:52,431
So, can you hold it for me? [Yogini:
“Yes, Mother”].

1873
02:39:52,632 --> 02:39:56,969
Now, should I cut the cake first, and then
take the flowers, all right?

1874
02:39:57,177 --> 02:40:03,060
Thank you. So this is to celebrate
the resurrection of Christ.

1875
02:40:03,261 --> 02:40:07,872
And resurrection of all the sahaja yogis.
May God bless you all.

1876
02:40:08,073 --> 02:40:15,807
Thank you. Just beautiful. May God
bless you.

1877
02:40:17,533 --> 02:40:20,777
Hm. Good. Thank you.

1878
02:40:20,978 --> 02:40:26,881
Hm. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1879
02:40:31,342 --> 02:40:34,311
Very good vibrations.

1880
02:40:34,538 --> 02:40:38,736
Put your hands under my feet, let’s see,
under, like that.

1881
02:40:38,937 --> 02:40:41,742
Now put your head down there, let’s see.

1882
02:40:41,943 --> 02:40:45,825
Beautiful, good, great.

1883
02:40:46,033 --> 02:40:49,282
Now let’s see her. Let her come also.

1884
02:40:49,483 --> 02:40:53,700
Come along, put your foot, hands, too.

1885
02:40:53,932 --> 02:40:58,091
So, you have to tell me your names again.
What’s your name?

1886
02:40:58,339 --> 02:41:00,038
Girl: Lisa. Shri Mataji: Hm?
Girl: Lisa.

1887
02:41:00,239 --> 02:41:04,817
Shri Mataji: Lisa. I know.

1888
02:41:06,918 --> 02:41:13,478
Do you like this kind of dress, Lisa?
Next time for you also.

1889
02:41:17,398 --> 02:41:24,281
New one for Bumble – good, she is all
right, I think she is all right -

1890
02:41:34,502 --> 02:41:40,754
one for Athena, one for Olympia. They’ll
wear this kind of a dress. Eh?

1891
02:41:40,955 --> 02:41:43,972
How will they look, very sweet. Let them
wear saris,

1892
02:41:44,173 --> 02:41:48,837
I think, next time - that would be
the best.

1893
02:41:49,038 --> 02:41:57,634
Imagine, Athena and Olympia wearing that.

1894
02:41:58,324 --> 02:42:01,257
Now, it’s better.

1895
02:42:03,478 --> 02:42:06,328
Thank you very much.

1896
02:42:16,913 --> 02:42:19,500
May God bless you.

1897
02:42:21,075 --> 02:42:23,567
What is it now, Gavin?

1898
02:42:23,768 --> 02:42:26,622
Gavin: Mother, with Your permission,
Arneau has written a dedication.

1899
02:42:26,823 --> 02:42:29,665
Shri Mataji: Who? Gavin: Arneau sent it.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

1900
02:42:29,866 --> 02:42:32,717
Gavin: And then we’d like to sing Your
aarti, and then You could have Your supper.

1901
02:42:32,918 --> 02:42:35,923
Shri Mataji: All right. What is?
Gavin: After this

1902
02:42:36,124 --> 02:42:38,472
we’ll sing Your aarti, and then You may
have Your supper.

1903
02:42:38,673 --> 02:42:44,018
Shri Mataji: All right. Please. All right,
come along.

1904
02:42:44,219 --> 02:42:47,114
Gavin (reads): “Mother, for Your birthday,
we have made a pledge:

1905
02:42:47,393 --> 02:42:50,807
we should dedicate our life to Sahaja Yoga.

1906
02:42:51,015 --> 02:42:56,836
What is this pledge, and to what extent
can we follow this pledge?

1907
02:42:57,037 --> 02:43:01,950
We have to be collectively surrended
to our Beloved Mother.

1908
02:43:02,153 --> 02:43:08,538
We are collective the moment our Spirit
rejoins Your Heart, Mother.

1909
02:43:08,739 --> 02:43:15,307
We are collective the moment Your Smile
irradiates our beings.

1910
02:43:15,508 --> 02:43:19,972
We are collective the moment Your eyes
of love and compassion

1911
02:43:20,173 --> 02:43:25,747
pour into our heart their Divine flow
of unequalled beauty.

1912
02:43:25,948 --> 02:43:31,538
We are collective the moment Your heart
touches with softness and peace

1913
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:35,694
the inner part of our Selves;

1914
02:43:35,895 --> 02:43:40,064
collective means one heart, in the Heart
of the Divine.

1915
02:43:40,265 --> 02:43:44,673
One smile, in the Smile of God Almighty;

1916
02:43:44,874 --> 02:43:52,002
one joy melted in the Divine Joy of Your
Glory, You, our Beloved Mother.

1917
02:43:52,203 --> 02:43:57,631
One sound, expressed through the extremely
beautiful melody of Your Voice;

1918
02:43:57,832 --> 02:44:01,827
then, we surrender to You.

1919
02:44:02,028 --> 02:44:05,363
Surrender is a happening;

1920
02:44:05,564 --> 02:44:12,615
it is the exchange of love between
the Mother and the child.

1921
02:44:13,228 --> 02:44:16,483
Let us melt Your Heart,

1922
02:44:16,684 --> 02:44:21,480
let us dissolve ourselves in the inner part
of Your Heart;

1923
02:44:21,691 --> 02:44:26,169
so that we can see and feel the glory
of Your Becoming;

1924
02:44:26,370 --> 02:44:33,035
the tenderness of Your Face and the grace
of Your Hands.

1925
02:44:34,298 --> 02:44:41,311
But surrender is more: surrender is action
magnified through collectivity.

1926
02:44:41,530 --> 02:44:45,254
How can we love You, Mother, if we do
not act?

1927
02:44:45,455 --> 02:44:49,551
How can we follow You if we don’t find?

1928
02:44:49,752 --> 02:44:52,276
How can we be the Golden Builders,

1929
02:44:52,477 --> 02:44:57,862
if we do not build Your love and compassion
in our hearts?

1930
02:44:58,063 --> 02:45:02,303
Let us pray to You, Mother, to be Your
soldiers,

1931
02:45:02,504 --> 02:45:06,402
the soldiers of truth and of righteousness.

1932
02:45:06,603 --> 02:45:09,211
Please, take out our passivity.

1933
02:45:09,412 --> 02:45:14,605
Kill our inaction. Destroy our apathy.

1934
02:45:14,806 --> 02:45:18,558
Brothers and sisters, let us wake up
to gain the battlefield:

1935
02:45:18,759 --> 02:45:22,595
are we sahaja yogis or are we cowards?

1936
02:45:22,803 --> 02:45:27,265
Do we realise that we are the children
of Adi Shakti?

1937
02:45:27,466 --> 02:45:31,693
Do we see, every second of our life,
that She is Almighty,

1938
02:45:31,894 --> 02:45:38,593
that everything which lives and pulsates
comes from Her, and goes to Her?

1939
02:45:38,794 --> 02:45:46,225
That the whole universe is in Her command,
and bows at Her Lotus Feet?

1940
02:45:46,434 --> 02:45:51,449
That all the angels are protecting us,
to win the war?

1941
02:45:51,650 --> 02:45:55,129
We are not allowed to sit down, we have
to stand up,

1942
02:45:55,330 --> 02:46:00,395
to take the sword, to hold it firm in our
hands:

1943
02:46:00,596 --> 02:46:06,750
what is more glorious and beautiful than
to fight alongside our Beloved Mother?

1944
02:46:06,951 --> 02:46:12,007
When in the middle of the battlefield
we feel all is against us,

1945
02:46:12,208 --> 02:46:16,999
let us just pronounce Her Name in our
heart:

1946
02:46:17,266 --> 02:46:20,022
Your Name, Mother, like a pure river,

1947
02:46:20,223 --> 02:46:24,089
cleans and eliminates our fears and doubts,

1948
02:46:24,314 --> 02:46:28,706
fills us with confidence and joy, courage
and faith,

1949
02:46:28,907 --> 02:46:32,852
because Your Name is the Name of God
Almighty;

1950
02:46:33,053 --> 02:46:38,168
let us collectively surrender to You,
extreme beauty,

1951
02:46:38,369 --> 02:46:43,668
extraordinary glory, eternal purity,

1952
02:46:43,869 --> 02:46:49,443
cosmic power, greatest love,

1953
02:46:49,651 --> 02:46:55,185
unsurpassed splendour shining all over
the universe -

1954
02:46:55,386 --> 02:46:59,840
Mother, Mother of all the Mothers,

1955
02:47:00,041 --> 02:47:06,152
Mother of Your devoted children, this is
our pledge;

1956
02:47:06,353 --> 02:47:13,786
and with Your grace and blessings,
therefore reside in our heart forever”.

1957
02:47:17,739 --> 02:47:20,715
Shri Mataji: What beauty.

1958
02:47:45,002 --> 02:47:50,902
Beautiful. More than any aarti.

1959
02:47:54,805 --> 02:47:59,179
He realises, he realises the dimensions,

1960
02:47:59,380 --> 02:48:04,547
all the dimensions of this great time
he realises, you see;

1961
02:48:04,748 --> 02:48:08,419
you can see it very clearly.

1962
02:48:13,295 --> 02:48:16,771
It will work out; as I told you the other
day, infrastructure, you see,

1963
02:48:16,972 --> 02:48:19,503
has to work out, first of all, and
the Kundalini will work out,

1964
02:48:19,704 --> 02:48:24,093
and then it will spark. Nothing to be
disappointed, it will work out.

1965
02:48:24,294 --> 02:48:26,630
Kundalini will work out, but you have
to be very strong

1966
02:48:26,831 --> 02:48:33,809
about certain things, of loving others.
Strong to love, is the point;

1967
02:48:34,711 --> 02:48:41,501
of giving, of sacrificing, forbearing,
enjoying it.

1968
02:48:45,604 --> 02:48:49,429
Mildness, sweetness, gentleness,
graciousness towards others;

1969
02:48:49,637 --> 02:48:53,959
and towards yourself you have to be firm.

1970
02:49:02,442 --> 02:49:05,885
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

1971
02:49:06,086 --> 02:49:09,133
May God bless you all.

1972
02:49:11,242 --> 02:49:16,131
Whatever is said in this prayer, be your
own;

1973
02:49:16,332 --> 02:49:18,943
may it happen to you;

1974
02:49:19,144 --> 02:49:25,309
may it give you the manifestation
of what is desired.

1975
02:49:25,887 --> 02:49:28,598
May God bless you.

1976
02:49:44,642 --> 02:49:53,253
I was thinking, David, you can along with
Don and Gavin and all such people, you see,

1977
02:49:53,454 --> 02:49:59,366
those who can talk to Mr. Bishop [of]
Canterbury fellow,

1978
02:49:59,567 --> 02:50:03,198
could go and see him, some of you, could
go and see him,

1979
02:50:03,399 --> 02:50:07,773
and tell him that this is the what it is,
just for yourself;

1980
02:50:07,974 --> 02:50:11,253
if She is the Comforter, if She is the One
who has come,

1981
02:50:11,462 --> 02:50:17,231
will it not be amiss for you,

1982
02:50:18,669 --> 02:50:23,862
why not you first see Her and judge Her?

1983
02:50:24,063 --> 02:50:28,423
Yogi: Mother, Mother, the man on the radio
said that

1984
02:50:28,624 --> 02:50:36,016
if lots of people write to him, then it
could be a hour-long programme.

1985
02:50:36,217 --> 02:50:38,541
Would be good.
Shri Mataji: Better all of you write.

1986
02:50:38,742 --> 02:50:42,518
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Bhakti
gamyā namaha.

1987
02:50:42,718 --> 02:50:45,811
Yogis: Om swaha.

1988
02:50:46,012 --> 02:50:50,755
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Sharma
dāyinī namaha.

1989
02:50:50,956 --> 02:50:53,960

1990
02:50:54,161 --> 02:50:58,454
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nirādhārā
namaha.

1991
02:50:58,655 --> 02:51:01,647
Yogis: Om swaha.

1992
02:51:01,848 --> 02:51:05,829
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Niranjanā
namaha.

1993
02:51:06,029 --> 02:51:09,057
Yogis: Om swaha.

1994
02:51:09,258 --> 02:51:13,069
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nirlepā
namaha.

1995
02:51:13,270 --> 02:51:16,374
Yogis: Om swaha.

1996
02:51:16,575 --> 02:51:20,865
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nirmalā
namaha.

1997
02:51:21,066 --> 02:51:24,356
Yogis: Om swaha.

1998
02:51:24,557 --> 02:51:26,932
Shri Mataji: Just put it to him, so that he
can see …

1999
02:51:27,133 --> 02:51:31,712
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nishkalaṅkā
namaha.

2000
02:51:31,913 --> 02:51:34,826
Yogis: Om swaha.

2001
02:51:35,027 --> 02:51:38,707
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nityā
namaha.

2002
02:51:38,908 --> 02:51:42,629
Yogis: Om swaha.
Shri Mataji: Put it to him.

2003
02:51:42,830 --> 02:51:47,718
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nirākārā
namaha.

2004
02:51:47,919 --> 02:51:50,729
Yogis: Om swaha.

2005
02:51:50,930 --> 02:51:54,987
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nirākulā
namaha.

2006
02:51:55,188 --> 02:51:58,236
Yogis: Om swaha.

2007
02:51:58,437 --> 02:52:02,752
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nirgunā
namaha.

2008
02:52:02,998 --> 02:52:05,721
Yogis: Om swaha.

2009
02:52:05,922 --> 02:52:09,682
Gavin: Om twameva sakshat Shri Nishkalā
namaha.

2010
02:52:09,901 --> 02:52:12,864
Yogis: Om swaha.

2011
02:52:13,065 --> 02:52:16,708

and that Sahaj Yoga should be accepted
by people

and that it should spread like wildfire
