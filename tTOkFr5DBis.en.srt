1
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,610
Today we have assembled here

2
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,819
to worship Sadashiva,

3
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:57,402
which is reflected within us as Shiva, as the spirit.

4
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,735
He is reflected in our heart,

5
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:12,485
and as you have seen

6
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:20,235
that the goal of our life

7
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:27,861
was to achieve this state of spirit.

8
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:36,652
The other day I was reading some books

9
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:43,485
how it was done,

10
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:52,193
this Self-realization, to know the spirit,

11
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:57,652
and how people were tortured.

12
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:04,569
First of all they're asked to

13
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:12,735
somehow or other deny, defy and condemn their body.

14
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:19,902
Now, if the body wants to have comfort,

15
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:29,694
then it was said that first try to sleep on the carpet,

16
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:32,861
not on the bed.

17
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:37,777
Then still, it's not enough;

18
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,277
then from the carpet you go to a mat

19
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,443
still is not enough.

20
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:48,111
Then from that maybe,

21
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:52,193
you move down

22
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:57,069
to the Mother Earth,

23
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,485
sleep on the Mother Earth.

24
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:04,193
Still if the body is not all right

25
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:08,777
then you start sleeping on the stone.

26
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:13,027
But still the Himalayas are far away,

27
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:16,235
because Shiva resides in Kailasha.

28
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,235
So you go to Himalayas and sleep on the ice.

29
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,069
This was the minimum requirement.

30
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,777
Then it was said that you are fond of good food,

31
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:39,443
you want to have sumptuous food,

32
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:42,694
you eat a lot, all right;

33
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:46,819
so you deny everything that you like, to begin with,

34
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:48,944
all that you like.

35
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,610
For example, Italians cannot eat pasta!

36
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:02,819
Then deny that.

37
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,986
But that's not sufficient.

38
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:10,694
After that you start eating things

39
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:13,443
which are very bitter.

40
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:17,193
As in the Zen system they give you to eat

41
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:21,235
something which is like quinine raised to power 108,

42
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,360
absolutely bitter - or absolutely sweet.

43
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:30,111
So put your tongue into test.

44
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,402
But still the stomach is there.

45
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,402
So if you are eating too much,

46
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:41,318
you fast for one day. That's not sufficient.

47
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,652
Then fast for seven days.

48
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,777
Then for forty days.

49
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:50,527
I mean, a month has got only thirty days;

50
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,777
to fast for forty days means you are already finished.

51
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:58,986
That's how if you have to do your penance for nirvana.

52
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,694
As it is you get a nirvana

53
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:03,193
because you're finished and dead, you see,

54
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,986
nothing is left out of you, nothing but bones,

55
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:12,151
and these bones then become nirvana.

56
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,485
Ultimately the death follows,

57
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,235
so you are finished and there is nirvana,

58
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:18,819
no doubt about it.

59
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:23,111
Then you don't live in a house,

60
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,193
because house is comfort.

61
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,902
Give up your wife, give up your children, give up everyone.

62
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:34,318
Now wear only one something,

63
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,027
like a cloth tied round,

64
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:48,069
and go and ask for alms from people.

65
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:58,069
With these clothes also there's still problem,

66
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,819
because you're attached to your cloth.

67
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,443
So you go to Himalayas where there's nobody to see you,

68
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,944
take out your clothes

69
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:10,360
and in that cold you stay there, completely shaking.

70
00:08:10,944 --> 00:08:12,485
Then you'll get your nirvana.

71
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,652
As it is you get nirvana.

72
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,027
All such conditions were put

73
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:30,569
as to destroy the demands of your body to begin with.

74
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:34,569
You tell your body, "No, nothing doing.

75
00:08:34,986 --> 00:08:39,819
You better work out your nirvana."

76
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:45,902
The second thing was to destroy your mind

77
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:51,235
which takes you to senses,

78
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:54,694
to things of joy.

79
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:59,360
Supposing you want to have some,

80
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:05,318
something very much,

81
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:09,902
so deny that, deny that.

82
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,443
Anything that your mind tells you,

83
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:15,527
just say "No, no, no" to it.

84
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:18,777
In Sanskrit

85
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,861
the shloka is like this,

86
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:25,569
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

87
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:26,944
- which you go on saying,

88
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:31,152
"neti, neti": "No, not this, not this, not this, not this."

89
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:34,694
And then you can discuss about

90
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:37,861
- discuss only, yes - nirvana.

91
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:43,652
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

92
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:47,277
When I read this book I said,

93
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:50,861
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

94
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:58,069
But in Sahaja Yoga

95
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:01,193
is the other way round,

96
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:04,318
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

97
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:07,318
and then the foundation.

98
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:12,527
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

99
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:16,402
And then in the light of Sahasrara

100
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:20,152
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

101
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:26,111
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

102
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,861
through vibrations

103
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:34,527
is to see why:

104
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,986
why I want this?

105
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,277
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

106
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:43,151
Why my attention goes to food,

107
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,652
why to my family, why to my children,

108
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:50,277
when I have to achieve the highest?

109
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:53,527
So you start introspecting yourself.

110
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:57,111
Then you know on your vibrations also

111
00:10:57,402 --> 00:11:00,111
there's something wrong with you.

112
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,777
Then you don't try to see others,

113
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:07,151
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

114
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:13,151
because it's your own ascent

115
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,527
you have to achieve.

116
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:22,193
But in the olden times,

117
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:28,193
all these things were done individually.

118
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:32,694
Like a one person who starts

119
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,235
the path of nirvana,

120
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:45,152
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

121
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,902
stay away from people, avoid them,

122
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,652
have nothing to do,

123
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:53,902
and achieve this ascent,

124
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:58,193
Self-realization, only for himself.

125
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,986
It was not for others.

126
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:07,193
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

127
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:09,193
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

128
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:11,527
he wouldn't meet anybody

129
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:13,360
and he would sit somewhere

130
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:18,235
on top of a remote mountain.

131
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:22,069
Anybody who tried to meet him

132
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:25,569
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

133
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:28,569
and never meet that person.

134
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:36,610
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

135
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:41,235
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

136
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,485
This kind of singular achievements

137
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:50,485
did not lead people anywhere.

138
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:55,360
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

139
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:58,152
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

140
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,360
about righteousness, about value system;

141
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:07,902
but they too were regarded as something strange,

142
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,069
and were tortured and troubled.

143
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:20,027
So on the level of an individual ascent,

144
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,735
they couldn't do anything for others

145
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,819
except for talking about it, telling about it,

146
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:30,485
till Sahaja Yoga came.

147
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:34,819
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

148
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:40,485
Till the twelfth century in India

149
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,360
nobody talked about it to the public.

150
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:47,819
It was all in Sanskrit,

151
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,944
very difficult Sanskrit books

152
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,235
which were only available to few aspirants.

153
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,569
Was explained to very, very few even,

154
00:13:58,277 --> 00:14:02,694
amounting to few numbers of people.

155
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:09,944
But giving realization was denied.

156
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:15,027
So only one master had one disciple,

157
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,610
and all was the individual ascent,

158
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,735
individual working out.

159
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,360
Such a disciple was taken away from others

160
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:25,902
and was kept in secret,

161
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,193
worked it out on him;

162
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:32,944
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

163
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:35,944
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

164
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:40,151
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

165
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:43,193
neither he knew how to give realization.

166
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,485
So now you see how far you have gone.

167
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:51,485
You've got your realization

168
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:54,694
without giving up much.

169
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:59,944
You can work on a much wider scale,

170
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,819
you can give realizations to other.

171
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:06,694
You know about all the subtle knowledge

172
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:10,902
about Sahaja Yoga.

173
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:15,569
But today I'm going to tell you something more

174
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:18,277
which we have to know.

175
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,694
It's very important to know,

176
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:27,861
because as was described by people

177
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:33,861
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

178
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,986
but it's not from their heart.

179
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:45,111
And heart is the abode of the spirit

180
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:51,277
- is the Shiva within us.

181
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,902
So we have to know more about heart,

182
00:15:56,527 --> 00:16:00,277
and that is very important.

183
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:04,610
You know about these three nadis we have:

184
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:06,861
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

185
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:10,944
but in the heart there are four nadis.

186
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:19,111
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

187
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:26,360
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

188
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:31,027
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

189
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:35,193
Actually you ask for your destruction.

190
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:42,151
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

191
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,694
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

192
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:55,443
it's like when a fruit has to come,

193
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:59,443
the petals look as if they're destroyed

194
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:02,443
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

195
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:05,402
you can call it like your conditionings,

196
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:07,986
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

197
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,443
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

198
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:14,527
This has to be destroyed

199
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:18,151
for the beauty to come out.

200
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:25,443
So when your maryadas

201
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:30,527
you cross beyond certain point,

202
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:34,610
you go to your destruction.

203
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:41,443
In four directions there are destructions built,

204
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,777
as there are four nadis.

205
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:49,069
So now, what is to be done?

206
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:54,111
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

207
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:57,861
through the first nadi, going to hell?

208
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:03,861
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

209
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:07,861
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

210
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:11,277
He is innocence personified.

211
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:17,485
So

212
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:25,819
we have to put our carnal desires,

213
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,777
dissolve them,

214
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:36,318
dissolve them into the innocence,

215
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:39,944
the ocean of innocence.

216
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:47,235
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

217
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:55,235
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

218
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:59,777
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

219
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:03,902
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

220
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:09,652
you see children, they're innocent;

221
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:12,652
flowers, they're innocent.

222
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,944
Divert your attention

223
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,777
to all these things.

224
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:30,610
You see, on walking on the street,

225
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:34,111
what is there to see best

226
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:38,193
is all at three feet height.

227
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:43,111
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

228
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,443
all the beautiful grass,

229
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:50,151
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

230
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:54,777
You need not see people who are above that.

231
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:01,402
Just see on three feet level.

232
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:09,902
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

233
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:14,777
But you don't see the eyes of a person

234
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:18,027
who are not innocent.

235
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:22,485
So dissolve this desire

236
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:26,652
into innocence.

237
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:31,277
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

238
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:36,861
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

239
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,318
it is righteous,

240
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:43,402
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

241
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,735
it's pure.

242
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:50,277
So even if you are in this world,

243
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:52,944
even if you are living like a human being,

244
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,735
even if you have children,

245
00:20:56,527 --> 00:20:59,610
still you are innocent.

246
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:06,735
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

247
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:10,069
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

248
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,360
and the five more.

249
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:14,485
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

250
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:17,652
and five were the elements.

251
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,111
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

252
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:32,652
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

253
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:36,569
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

254
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:40,569
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

255
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:45,151
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

256
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:49,652
so flooded they could not cross over.

257
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:51,986
They came back, they said,

258
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:57,235
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

259
00:21:58,152 --> 00:21:59,485
So this Krishna said,

260
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,610
"All right, you just go and say,

261
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:06,360
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

262
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:12,193
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

263
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:15,944
you go down.'"

264
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:20,777
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

265
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:23,360
What is He talking about?"

266
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,527
So they went down and said this to the river,

267
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,652
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

268
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:35,277
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

269
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:44,111
They went across and worshipped that rishi

270
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:49,111
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

271
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,819
So they went back to the rishi, said,

272
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:55,527
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

273
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,111
He said, "How did you come?"

274
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,277
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

275
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:03,819
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

276
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:06,944
and he had eaten such a lot.

277
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,735
"All right, you go and tell this river that

278
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:14,151
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

279
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:16,694
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

280
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,569
He said, "Just go and see."

281
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:24,527
They went back and told this to the river.

282
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:29,652
The river again went down.

283
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,902
So to live in this world,

284
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,902
to be a wife or to be a husband,

285
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:43,360
to be married, whatever it is,

286
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:47,986
you can be innocent,

287
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,819
absolutely innocent about it.

288
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,527
That's the sign of your purity.

289
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:03,819
The second nadi, the second channel

290
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,694
that can take you to destruction is desire.

291
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:11,318
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

292
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:15,443
is the only way that people do not get old,

293
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:18,151
nor sick,

294
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:22,027
nor worried.

295
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:29,318
Now this desire that we have,

296
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,111
"I want this,"

297
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:35,652
in the West is much more than anywhere else

298
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:38,151
because the entrepreneurs are every day

299
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,694
producing new things.

300
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:44,777
Say for example a hairdress,

301
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,694
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

302
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,193
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

303
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:55,569
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

304
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:03,652
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

305
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:07,527
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

306
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:13,777
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

307
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:20,861
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

308
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:26,777
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

309
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:32,360
The desires could be also

310
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:35,027
quite mental,

311
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,902
"I must possess this woman,

312
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,235
I must possess this child."

313
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:48,569
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

314
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:53,360
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

315
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,819
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

316
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:13,027
Go on adding up things, getting things

317
00:26:16,694 --> 00:26:20,819
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

318
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:25,360
What is the reason

319
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:30,986
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

320
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:34,485
It's an impure desire.

321
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:36,694
It's an impure desire,

322
00:26:36,944 --> 00:26:39,152
and when such a desire starts working

323
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:41,485
you can go any far,

324
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,277
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

325
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:46,111
like anything is nothing

326
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:50,944
but absolutely desire beyond

327
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,861
any limitations.

328
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:59,360
You want to dominate others

329
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,735
is also another desire.

330
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:08,402
All these desires

331
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:13,277
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

332
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:17,694
because there's no joy,

333
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:20,235
there's no happiness.

334
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:28,402
For example, now I want to have a sari,

335
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:34,527
so I want to buy a sari.

336
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:38,402
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

337
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,861
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

338
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:45,944
The attention becomes polluted,

339
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:50,527
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

340
00:27:50,944 --> 00:27:54,944
The attention which has to enjoy,

341
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:59,610
which has to enjoy the spirit,

342
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:03,819
which has to nourish the spirit,

343
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:10,111
becomes disturbed because of desires.

344
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:15,152
In the first place the attention

345
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,360
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

346
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,485
In the second place the attention

347
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:29,694
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

348
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:39,735
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

349
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:46,485
The desire for beautiful things

350
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,527
- we can shift our desire,

351
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,152
material desire into aesthetics,

352
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,111
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

353
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:05,819
because that's the quality of Shiva,

354
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,819
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

355
00:29:10,152 --> 00:29:12,402
Now supposing this looks very plain,

356
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:16,069
simple and one may say that mechanical.

357
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,819
But if it was Shiva's job

358
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:22,402
He would have done something beautiful about it.

359
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:28,819
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

360
00:29:29,485 --> 00:29:33,069
that is created by Brahmadeva,

361
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:37,069
evolved by Vishnu.

362
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:40,694
He's the one who does

363
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:44,069
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

364
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:46,569
You've seen My photographs many a times

365
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:51,111
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

366
00:29:51,443 --> 00:29:52,819
He's doing it.

367
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:55,819
He throws lights in such a manner,

368
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:58,694
He works out in such a manner.

369
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:01,861
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

370
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:03,694
It's His job.

371
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:07,694
So His job is to create aesthetics:

372
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:12,193
aesthetics of behavior,

373
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:17,069
aesthetics of poetry.

374
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:24,318
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

375
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:29,569
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

376
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:34,318
So whatever you desire,

377
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:38,027
if you start working it out,

378
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,360
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

379
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:52,944
gradually you'll find

380
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,694
you'll end up with vibrations,

381
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:59,652
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

382
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,485
And to have the vibrations

383
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:06,944
you'll have to go to pure desire.

384
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:11,360
So this desire which is madness,

385
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:14,027
which makes you mad,

386
00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:20,027
which is so much dull and boring

387
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:25,902
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

388
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:28,443
all your desires into vibration.

389
00:31:28,694 --> 00:31:32,652
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

390
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:37,861
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

391
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:41,443
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

392
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:45,777
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

393
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:55,069
I've seen people running away

394
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,152
from some people

395
00:31:57,443 --> 00:32:01,610
as if some monkey is after them.

396
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:03,027
When I look around,

397
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:04,902
I find there are people who are drunkard,

398
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:07,402
or somebody coming or something.

399
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:11,027
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

400
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:12,735
but now they run away,

401
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:17,111
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

402
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:21,610
We had three, four hippies to begin

403
00:32:21,986 --> 00:32:24,069
with who came with Me to India.

404
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,193
They're normal like you, they were become,

405
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,151
you see, Sahaja yogis.

406
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:32,360
And four, five hippies came to My program,

407
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:34,652
it was in Rahuri, I think.

408
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:39,318
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

409
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:41,027
I said, "What's the matter with you?

410
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:42,944
Why are you so frightened?"

411
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:45,193
So I turned round to see these hippies,

412
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,443
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

413
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:52,069
They were no more there.

414
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:58,777
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

415
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,485
into vibrations.

416
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:02,861
And if it does not,

417
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:05,318
then you must know there's something still missing.

418
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:08,610
But if you do not do this,

419
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:13,111
then you end up into your destruction.

420
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:17,944
So to say that He's a destroyer

421
00:33:18,277 --> 00:33:22,652
is a very one-sided statement.

422
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:27,152
He has both the powers.

423
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,360
He has the power to give you vibrations.

424
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,944
He gives you vibrations.

425
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:43,277
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

426
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,069
but He makes the vibrations.

427
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:49,193
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

428
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:54,193
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

429
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,069
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

430
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:04,152
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

431
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:09,111
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

432
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:14,152
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

433
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:18,944
Today only I was explaining

434
00:34:19,277 --> 00:34:22,402
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

435
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:25,569
and has done so much study of bhakti

436
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:27,902
and all that and knew so much,

437
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:32,360
just merged into Me.

438
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:35,277
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

439
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:37,402
because normally people don't do.

440
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:39,527
When they are reading about Devi they think,

441
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,318
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

442
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,443
You see, it's separate things.

443
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:46,902
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

444
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,777
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

445
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:54,027
It's written that how You are gentle,

446
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:57,027
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

447
00:34:57,402 --> 00:34:59,111
how She looks after me,

448
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:01,777
how Her attention is on me."

449
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:05,902
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

450
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:08,527
every glance is an inspection."

451
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:10,777
But "inspection" not a very good word,

452
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:14,652
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

453
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:19,652
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

454
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:23,402
You are all the time - when I listen to music

455
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,819
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

456
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:30,735
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

457
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:34,527
All the time I feel Your love."

458
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,861
That's how the bhakti comes in.

459
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:40,610
So if you have vibrations

460
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:45,193
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

461
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,527
No,

462
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:52,861
it means the joy of bhakti.

463
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:59,111
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

464
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:04,443
It's the ocean of love that is God.

465
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:07,151
You just get drenched into it.

466
00:36:07,443 --> 00:36:09,902
There's no words to it.

467
00:36:14,151 --> 00:36:16,111
And that is what when you feel,

468
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:18,694
you must know that

469
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:23,402
you have taken the spirit

470
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:28,986
as a real connection

471
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:33,652
between you and your Mother,

472
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:37,318
or your Father.

473
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:44,777
There's no differentiation.

474
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:50,527
You are one

475
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:53,527
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

476
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:56,569
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

477
00:36:57,111 --> 00:37:00,151
You are one in that bhakti.

478
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:05,151
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

479
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:11,193
because not man-made.

480
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:19,151
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

481
00:37:20,443 --> 00:37:24,443
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

482
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:27,777
but is the bhakti.

483
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,069
That is the joy

484
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:33,694
of Shiva's quality,

485
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:37,485
the quality of joy that He adds

486
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:41,027
to our life.

487
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:45,902
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

488
00:37:46,152 --> 00:37:48,235
Same thing the joy,

489
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:51,235
that "I'm loved so much by God,

490
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:53,694
that God loves me,

491
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:56,944
that I have a meaning in life."

492
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:03,443
Then the ego drops out first of all,

493
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:10,485
and also the conditionings drop out.

494
00:38:14,443 --> 00:38:17,443
Now the third nadi:

495
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:26,152
third nadi

496
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:30,610
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

497
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,610
attached to someone.

498
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:39,277
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

499
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:41,986
this is my family,

500
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:44,527
this is my wife,

501
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:48,694
this is my father, this is my mother.

502
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:54,735
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

503
00:38:55,111 --> 00:38:58,235
when they are just the beginners,

504
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:03,152
so they talk about their whole family,

505
00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:05,861
"My father is like this,

506
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:09,111
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

507
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:14,360
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

508
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:19,735
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

509
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,610
What should I do?

510
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:30,569
Like today somebody said that "You see,

511
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,902
they lost their first child.

512
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:36,360
First child they lost,

513
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:40,069
because the child was sleeping in another room."

514
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:44,111
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

515
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,277
and mother must look after the children."

516
00:39:46,443 --> 00:39:47,819
It's simple thing - I mean,

517
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:50,652
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

518
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,485
She'll throw away the husband,

519
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:56,027
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

520
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,069
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

521
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:03,819
But they don't believe in it.

522
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,235
So all right - what can we do?

523
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:09,360
Have we taken their contract that

524
00:40:09,694 --> 00:40:11,610
we should look after their children,

525
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:15,235
even when they don't want to listen to us?

526
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:22,151
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

527
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:26,443
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

528
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:31,569
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

529
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:35,485
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

530
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,360
as if I've let them down.

531
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,027
But they don't want to see that

532
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:47,443
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

533
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:50,069
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

534
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:53,151
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

535
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:56,027
Something missing, you don't deserve.

536
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,318
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

537
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:03,318
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

538
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:07,902
is something which has got the contract.

539
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:09,652
Immediately they'll inform you,

540
00:41:09,944 --> 00:41:10,986
"Now somebody is sick there,

541
00:41:11,193 --> 00:41:13,069
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

542
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,277
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

543
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:25,402
These attachments start working within us.

544
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,902
Now some people I've seen

545
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:33,235
are very attached to their children

546
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:40,193
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

547
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:42,193
And suddenly they discover

548
00:41:42,443 --> 00:41:45,986
the child is now is a devil's child.

549
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,193
The child starts answering back,

550
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:52,193
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

551
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:55,610
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

552
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:59,152
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

553
00:41:59,402 --> 00:42:00,485
giving so much love."

554
00:42:00,777 --> 00:42:02,402
And they feel even worse,

555
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:06,152
because "I have done so much for my wife,

556
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:07,652
and she is treating me like this."

557
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,193
"I've done so much for my husband,

558
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:11,735
and he is treating me like this."

559
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:13,610
Why do you do so much?

560
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:15,318
There's no need.

561
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:19,735
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

562
00:42:20,861 --> 00:42:22,152
I never feel that way.

563
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:25,111
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

564
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:27,069
and they have gone down.

565
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:28,610
Only thing if I feel anything,

566
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,652
only God knows where will they jump?

567
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,485
Where will they be in hell?

568
00:42:32,735 --> 00:42:35,485
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

569
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:37,485
Not the concern what has happened,

570
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,151
because nothing can \happen to Me.

571
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:44,986
But if they have been sinful

572
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:49,861
I just get worried about their future,

573
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,277
about their lives. That's different.

574
00:42:53,735 --> 00:42:56,277
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

575
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,152
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

576
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:02,610
my this thing, my that."

577
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:09,152
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

578
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,235
It's a sentence you must remember,

579
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:14,610
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

580
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:19,360
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

581
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:22,569
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

582
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:26,402
could be my own child - is not mine."

583
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:31,277
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

584
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:35,152
This relationship is all right till

585
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:39,610
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

586
00:43:39,944 --> 00:43:44,610
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

587
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:47,151
then I'm not with that person.

588
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,861
I've seen there are many like that,

589
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:50,694
but very good Sahaja yogis.

590
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:52,402
They'll never side with their wives,

591
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:54,735
never side with their children,

592
00:43:55,152 --> 00:43:58,360
because they know if you are siding with them

593
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:03,735
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

594
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:05,819
They're worried about their ascent

595
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:09,152
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

596
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:13,151
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

597
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,027
I have seen some children

598
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,027
who are extremely naughty,

599
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:23,152
they're very troublesome, very violent,

600
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:26,152
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

601
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:29,485
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

602
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:30,861
But others will say,

603
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:33,610
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

604
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:37,360
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

605
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:45,027
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

606
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:49,027
that "Why am I attached?"

607
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,151
I've given this simile many a times,

608
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:54,235
like the sap of the tree rises,

609
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:58,027
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

610
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:01,569
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

611
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:03,735
looks after the leaves,

612
00:45:03,986 --> 00:45:05,777
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

613
00:45:06,152 --> 00:45:09,193
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

614
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:12,193
If it gets involved into one of them

615
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:13,777
the whole tree will die,

616
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,111
and that part which

617
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:22,318
is so close to the sap will also die.

618
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,944
But sap has much more sense than we have.

619
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:32,569
To them, husband's so important

620
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,027
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

621
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,443
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

622
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:42,443
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

623
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:44,360
- so nobody can talk about wife,

624
00:45:44,694 --> 00:45:45,944
children, nothing.

625
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:50,152
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

626
00:45:50,569 --> 00:45:51,861
So no headache to the guru.

627
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:53,610
As soon as you start talking

628
00:45:53,944 --> 00:45:56,569
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

629
00:45:56,861 --> 00:46:00,569
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

630
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:06,111
But in Sahaja Yoga -

631
00:46:06,402 --> 00:46:10,402
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

632
00:46:11,152 --> 00:46:12,610
work to do.

633
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:14,777
It has to penetrate into the society,

634
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:17,069
into the political life, into economic life.

635
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:19,151
You have to emancipate the whole world.

636
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,694
Try to understand your responsibility.

637
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:28,111
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

638
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:33,610
How much wisdom you must have,

639
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:35,861
how much love you must have,

640
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:39,360
and how much discrimination you must have,

641
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:41,318
to understand that you are chosen

642
00:46:41,652 --> 00:46:44,652
for the emancipation of the whole world.

643
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:52,277
So now this so-called limited love,

644
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:55,944
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

645
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:59,402
is the unlimited love.

646
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:05,861
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

647
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:14,735
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

648
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:19,652
that wants your benevolence.

649
00:47:21,152 --> 00:47:22,861
That's what Shiva is.

650
00:47:23,152 --> 00:47:26,193
It wants your benevolence.

651
00:47:27,986 --> 00:47:31,277
It looks after your benevolence.

652
00:47:31,944 --> 00:47:35,986
So when

653
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:42,111
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

654
00:47:44,986 --> 00:47:48,485
then the whole life changes,

655
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:53,652
the whole pattern changes,

656
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:56,610
and you really enjoy it because

657
00:47:56,986 --> 00:47:59,152
you become one with so many,

658
00:47:59,527 --> 00:48:02,318
concerned with so many families, so many things,

659
00:48:02,735 --> 00:48:07,027
so many problems of others,

660
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:10,151
and you just feel you are one with so many.

661
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:13,944
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

662
00:48:14,402 --> 00:48:17,027
First time when I came to Italy,

663
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:19,861
I must tell you,

664
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:23,485
I came with Christine - no,

665
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:27,360
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

666
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:30,819
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

667
00:48:31,193 --> 00:48:33,027
And we had told some newspaper

668
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,569
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

669
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:38,360
Nothing was done.

670
00:48:38,694 --> 00:48:41,569
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

671
00:48:41,944 --> 00:48:45,151
So I went round with her to put the posters,

672
00:48:45,485 --> 00:48:48,193
but still nobody came.

673
00:48:48,777 --> 00:48:51,069
And today we are so many.

674
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:55,777
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

675
00:48:59,027 --> 00:49:04,485
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

676
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,777
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

677
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:14,235
And then you don't think what race you are,

678
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,485
what country you are, what this thing you are,

679
00:49:16,735 --> 00:49:18,819
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

680
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:22,735
So you become a universal being.

681
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:26,694
And this attitude has to be achieved.

682
00:49:27,151 --> 00:49:29,277
When I hear that some Indian girls

683
00:49:29,694 --> 00:49:33,610
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

684
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:38,152
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

685
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:41,318
or some Indians are treating somebody

686
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:43,861
because they are of low caste.

687
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:45,986
It's not possible,

688
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:49,193
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

689
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:54,443
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

690
00:49:55,152 --> 00:49:57,318
But this is only possible

691
00:49:57,735 --> 00:50:01,610
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

692
00:50:01,986 --> 00:50:04,777
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

693
00:50:05,152 --> 00:50:07,152
then only it is possible.

694
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,402
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

695
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:13,152
- just watch yourself.

696
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:19,193
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

697
00:50:20,735 --> 00:50:24,610
You see, I would say that

698
00:50:25,735 --> 00:50:28,485
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

699
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,111
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

700
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:34,861
that will be nice for that one."

701
00:50:35,152 --> 00:50:37,069
For Myself if you say,

702
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,777
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

703
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:43,485
impossible situation.

704
00:50:45,152 --> 00:50:47,777
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

705
00:50:48,402 --> 00:50:52,069
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

706
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,111
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

707
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,819
even if I am thirsty.

708
00:50:57,193 --> 00:51:00,151
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

709
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:03,111
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

710
00:51:03,235 --> 00:51:05,986
This will be good for that person."

711
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:14,902
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

712
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:18,235
I mean, why all this is for there?

713
00:51:18,694 --> 00:51:20,443
After all, think about yourself,

714
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:23,694
"Why am I here?

715
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:29,652
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

716
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:33,027
They are all realized souls,

717
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,902
such beautiful lotuses.

718
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:41,527
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

719
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:44,902
Now I am a lotus."

720
00:51:47,777 --> 00:51:53,235
That is the way you open the heart,

721
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:58,111
the lotus of your heart.

722
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:03,151
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

723
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,694
is so beautiful.

724
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,235
So you are no more divisive,

725
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:15,986
you do not want to separate from each other.

726
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:20,569
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

727
00:52:20,902 --> 00:52:22,694
you don't think that it should be done here

728
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:25,111
or there or there, but anywhere

729
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,902
- but should be all of us together.

730
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:36,111
So the small attachments that are with you

731
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:40,360
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

732
00:52:40,694 --> 00:52:44,193
which is Shiva.

733
00:52:49,944 --> 00:52:53,235
Fourth one is the most important

734
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:56,027
for all of us is to know

735
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,235
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

736
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,443
into the heart.

737
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:07,027
Starts from the heart, goes up,

738
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:09,902
passes through Agnya.

739
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:13,944
It has four petals, and opens up.

740
00:53:18,944 --> 00:53:22,027
This is the one which gives

741
00:53:22,652 --> 00:53:26,443
you the state which is called as turya.

742
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:30,902
We live in three states.

743
00:53:31,193 --> 00:53:34,694
In the living - in the awakened state,

744
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:39,111
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

745
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:41,902
we spoil our attention.

746
00:53:44,443 --> 00:53:48,777
But the second one is the one what we call

747
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:50,819
is that we sleep.

748
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:54,777
When we sleep also

749
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:57,277
all these things that have happened

750
00:53:57,569 --> 00:54:00,443
come to us from our past and things like that.

751
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:06,443
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

752
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,652
Is a state where

753
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:14,902
you have deep sleep,

754
00:54:15,193 --> 00:54:18,986
and you dream of something that is reality also.

755
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:23,111
You may dream about Me.

756
00:54:23,986 --> 00:54:28,193
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

757
00:54:28,652 --> 00:54:32,861
where some beautiful

758
00:54:33,193 --> 00:54:34,902
informations are passed on.

759
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:37,402
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

760
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:39,527
Italians might know in their sushupti

761
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:42,318
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

762
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:44,318
- depends on.

763
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:46,527
But the fourth state is called as turya.

764
00:54:46,777 --> 00:54:48,111
There are two more states.

765
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:50,277
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

766
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,318
"turya" means fourth.

767
00:54:52,735 --> 00:54:56,402
Fourth state is where that you are

768
00:54:56,777 --> 00:54:59,861
in a thoughtless awareness state.

769
00:55:01,485 --> 00:55:06,318
When there is no thought - just think of it

770
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:11,402
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

771
00:55:12,277 --> 00:55:16,777
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

772
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:21,652
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

773
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,069
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

774
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:26,986
is the "turya sthiti."

775
00:55:27,277 --> 00:55:30,986
And in this state when you are,

776
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:37,069
these four petals which are within you

777
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:41,402
have to open out in your brain.

778
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:46,610
They come from your heart to your brain.

779
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:54,777
And that is when

780
00:55:57,277 --> 00:56:02,986
you absolutely understand what is God,

781
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:12,902
absolutely you know what is God is.

782
00:56:14,986 --> 00:56:19,360
That is the time when

783
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:26,443
one receives the real knowledge.

784
00:56:32,986 --> 00:56:36,027
But unless and until these four petals open,

785
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:38,151
one may fall back,

786
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:41,235
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

787
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:46,235
who are still meddling with things

788
00:56:46,777 --> 00:56:49,986
that they should not do, go down.

789
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:55,360
And they don't understand what is God is.

790
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,193
But it's not the understanding

791
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:01,360
- in a way you understand this one little point,

792
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:05,569
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

793
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:09,527
not from brain to your heart.

794
00:57:11,902 --> 00:57:14,819
It comes

795
00:57:15,193 --> 00:57:18,443
as if the ambrosia of

796
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:22,986
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

797
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,735
Say for example,

798
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:30,069
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

799
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,694
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

800
00:57:31,986 --> 00:57:34,610
where he described what is God, this, that;

801
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:37,360
and "viveka" means the conscience,

802
00:57:37,735 --> 00:57:41,485
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

803
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:45,069
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

804
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:48,527
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

805
00:57:48,861 --> 00:57:50,277
Shankaracharya.

806
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:52,861
He said, "No use talking to them."

807
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:55,986
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

808
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,151
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

809
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,193
praising the Mother.

810
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:02,819
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

811
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:06,694
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

812
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,235
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

813
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:14,151
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

814
00:58:14,443 --> 00:58:19,027
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

815
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:24,777
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

816
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:27,652
And if that is God,

817
00:58:27,986 --> 00:58:31,193
then how can you suspect anything,

818
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:34,527
how can you

819
00:58:35,485 --> 00:58:37,485
try to analyze anything?

820
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:41,485
It's God. It's God Almighty,

821
00:58:41,944 --> 00:58:44,193
which knows everything,

822
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,610
which does everything,

823
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:49,777
which enjoys everything.

824
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,152
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

825
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:56,193
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

826
00:58:56,485 --> 00:58:57,610
the pure knowledge.

827
00:58:57,944 --> 00:59:00,152
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

828
00:59:00,527 --> 00:59:02,527
not the knowledge of vibrations,

829
00:59:02,986 --> 00:59:04,777
not the knowledge of kundalini,

830
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:09,527
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

831
00:59:10,027 --> 00:59:13,610
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

832
00:59:13,944 --> 00:59:15,151
Again I tell you,

833
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,902
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

834
00:59:20,694 --> 00:59:27,360
something that comes out of your experience of joy

835
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:29,069
and covers your brain.

836
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:31,944
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

837
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,152
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

838
00:59:35,485 --> 00:59:38,610
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

839
00:59:38,944 --> 00:59:42,151
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

840
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:43,902
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

841
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:47,027
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

842
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:49,151
The knowledge about your mother,

843
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,902
the one who has given you birth;

844
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:55,777
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

845
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,485
But knowledge about God,

846
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:01,069
that He's love, that He's truth,

847
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,193
that He knows everything,

848
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:08,694
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

849
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:13,652
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

850
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:17,443
So it's important,

851
01:00:17,777 --> 01:00:20,694
specially for the people of the West,

852
01:00:21,027 --> 01:00:23,151
now open your hearts,

853
01:00:23,443 --> 01:00:27,569
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

854
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:34,443
Do not judge people on vibrations.

855
01:00:34,777 --> 01:00:38,318
Judge yourself, all the time.

856
01:00:38,777 --> 01:00:43,777
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

857
01:00:44,027 --> 01:00:46,069
more understanding, more this thing;

858
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:52,235
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

859
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:59,152
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

860
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,443
it's God.

861
01:01:02,902 --> 01:01:06,902
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

862
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:12,735
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

863
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:16,402
She may be anything, but I know Her.

864
01:01:16,902 --> 01:01:18,527
It cannot be described in one book,

865
01:01:18,777 --> 01:01:21,443
it cannot be described in hundred books.

866
01:01:21,902 --> 01:01:24,861
It cannot be described in words,

867
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:29,777
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

868
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:33,069
God Almighty.

869
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,151
And that gives you

870
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:42,027
that beautiful surrender,

871
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:46,235
where you just feel absolutely secured

872
01:01:48,694 --> 01:01:51,694
in that ocean of love.

873
01:01:52,485 --> 01:01:55,152
I wish you all to achieve that state.

874
01:01:56,152 --> 01:01:59,610
May God bless you.
