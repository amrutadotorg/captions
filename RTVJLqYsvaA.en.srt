1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,404
I could not accommodate all of you in my house then I thought better to come here all of you would fit here!

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,899
And today is the last day for our Sahaj Yogis (before India Tour).

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:28,125
We have to understand certain very, very important
things about ourselves and our organisation that is Divine.

4
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:43,840
Now, in broad lines, I can tell you, not individual
problems and individual things because you are no more individuals now.

5
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,463
You have become part and parcel of the divine Being and you are awakened cells.

6
00:00:51,463 --> 00:01:00,760
And so, in a broad way we must understand what we have to do about it.

7
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:13,962
First thing, we have to kno that we are Realised souls,

8
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:29,155
and that you have got Realisation and that you are saints; that you have all the powers that a saint could have.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,960
No saint ever had more powers than you have, as it is, which is manifesting.

10
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,609
No saint had any knowledge that you have today.

11
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:51,399
You’ll be amazed, none of the books which have been written so far have been able to

12
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:59,950
tell you about the spiritual being that is
within you as you have come to know through

13
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,310
Sahaja Yoga.

14
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,700
One has to accept it.

15
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,729
It is so.

16
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:16,020
Any one of them, whosoever has written any
books – even, I would say, Adi Shankaracharya,

17
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,860
he could not explain so many things which
you know.

18
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:29,890
But the quality of Adi Shankaracharya is very
great, or people of his type – Markandeya

19
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,120
or Buddha.

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,460
The quality is very high because they are
extremely pure people – purity.

21
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,400
They have achieved individual salvation of
a very high degree.

22
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,170
While you have achieved your collective salvation
better.

23
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,310
But individually they are of a very, very
high quality.

24
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,400
I mean, they had no doubts about Divine Power,
they had no doubts about God.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,840
They never had any doubts and they were very
dignified.

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,950
And they never bothered as to their petty
problems of life.

27
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,420
For them this was too petty to think about.

28
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:20,450
Anything which is so petty, we spent so much
time over it.

29
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:30,390
I know we had to do it because, after all,
we are human beings and are coming into Sahaja

30
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:40,950
Yoga with our human awareness and then we
got our Realisation.

31
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,450
So the purification time is very, very short.

32
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,300
And while they had such a lot of time to purify
themselves.

33
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:56,810
Now, for example, Moses was an incarnation,
a very pure form of a personality or, you

34
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,250
can say, Jesus was an incarnation, absolutely
purest form of incarnation.

35
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:14,020
But they are there to be our ideals while
what we have done is to become, from human

36
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,430
beings, a prophet.

37
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:24,039
So you understand both the things very well,
what the weaknesses human beings have, what

38
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:32,810
are their problems, how they get away from
reality, how they are deluded.

39
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,810
But still we do not use our vibratory power
as we should use.

40
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:45,090
And this is the point I want to tell you – that
you all have vibratory powers.

41
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:54,210
When we start using our vibratory powers also
we do not know what dignity, protocol we should

42
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,840
have for using this power.

43
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:07,539
It is the power of the Deities within us and it’s a ritual by which we get their power

44
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,529
working in us.

45
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:19,590
As you know that people of ancient times did lot of miracles through this power but they

46
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,960
were very dignified people.

47
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:32,570
There was no frivolousness in their character
and not useless problems within them, absolutely

48
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,689
of no spiritual value.

49
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:40,430
When you use your vibratory awareness you
should not use them for useless powers like,

50
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,999
for example, going to a cinema and there’s
a traffic and you think that there’s a traffic

51
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,819
so you must use your vibratory powers to reach
that place.

52
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,710
Because it’s frivolous; it does not matter.

53
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,400
In Sahaja Yoga it does not matter whether you go to a cinema or not.

54
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,210
What matters is: what are your spiritual powers, how far you have come in your spirituality.

55
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,680
It (the cinema) does not matter at all.

56
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,249
You are a saint, and what saintliness you are achieving within you is the main problem.

57
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:18,100
Otherwise, all the rest of the things that
you have, has no meaning.

58
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,879
Or all these problems have no meaning in spirituality.

59
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:30,529
So, all the Sahaja Yogis must realise that you are now newly born and you are people

60
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,990
of new awareness and you have to have that
dignity.

61
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,030
I’ll just give an example because I was
discussing with someone today,

62
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:44,113
that when you give somebody a sort of a bandhan, you just turn your hand like this or like that.

63
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,574
This is not the way it should be done.

64
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,779
Your hands itself are to be respected because these are the hands of a saint.

65
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:55,569
And all the deities reside on your hands and
fingers so when you have to give them bandhan

66
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,139
or anything, you have to use them properly.

67
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,699
Use them in such a way that it’s dignified
to do it.

68
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:12,270
Any indignity or cheap behaviour should be
absolutely avoided.

69
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:20,599
Then dealing with each other you have to know
that you are all now in the circulation of

70
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:21,599
Divine Power.

71
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,710
You have to respect each other and really
love each other.

72
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,330
You must respect because you are all saints.

73
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,580
Every saint must respect another saint.

74
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,389
That’s the minimum of minimum.

75
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:40,120
And if you do not respect each other, your
chakras will go out of order, especially Vishuddhi

76
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,810
because it’s the collective thing.

77
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,039
And also Mother’s Chakra will go out because
your sense of security is your collectivity.

78
00:07:48,039 --> 00:08:00,229
And the love between each other has to be
not only looked after but is to be nourished

79
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,960
and to be worshipped and it should be a virtue.

80
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,389
You should not treat each other as human beings
treat each other.

81
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,389
No!

82
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,300
It’s a precious thing.

83
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,339
And even while talking to anyone very close
– say your brother, sister, husband, wife

84
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:24,080
– you must respect, you must respect, otherwise,
it has no meaning.

85
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,219
You must respect your parents much more than
you ever respected because they are Sahaja

86
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,940
Yogis, because they are saints and they are
your parents.

87
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,430
Respect is the keynote of relationship with
each other to begin with.

88
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,210
And respect without love has no meaning.

89
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,630
Respect and love for each other.

90
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,630
Whether somebody is highly placed in life,
somebody is lowly placed in life, in Sahaja

91
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,600
Yoga it does not matter.

92
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,820
How much you earn, what is your position in
life, where you live is not important.

93
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,140
The main important thing is that we are one
and we are the people who have become now

94
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,570
prophets and we are the ones who have got
the powers to raise the Kundalini of others

95
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,530
and such a power has come into us because
our Mother loves us very much and it is our

96
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,690
duty that we should love each other.

97
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,500
And how I respect you?

98
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,200
I need not because you know that there’s
a big gap between you and me.

99
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
But I respect you because you are saints.

100
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,900
And where the saints are not respected that country goes to dogs.

101
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,390
So first of all you must learn how to respect
each other.

102
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,900
And that is a very, very important training
we should have.

103
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:55,940
Whether he’s your husband or wife, whether
he’s your brother or sister, father, mother

104
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,970
or child, because he’s a saint – respect!

105
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,260
But I do not know how you will react to this
one that immediately you start thinking about

106
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,560
people who do not respect you.

107
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,430
Think how many people you do not respect.

108
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,560
It’s a typical ego-oriented reaction that
immediately we start thinking, “Oh, that

109
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,890
man does not respect me!

110
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,890
That man does not respect!”

111
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,610
But just think how many people you have not respected yourself.

112
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:35,210
When I am not here, I am here much more.

113
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,560
I have not been to Australia, and you know how tremendously these people have come up

114
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,060
– so pure and so good and so fantastic.

115
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,170
But that has not happened so much here because
I had to work, really labour here.

116
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,490
Not that England is that bad.

117
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,910
But all the time to feel that, “Mother is
around.

118
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,029
We’ll put all our problems to Her and She
can solve them.

119
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,060
” Even small, small problems you bring to
me – it’s all right – but now you are

120
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,810
capable of solving your problems as well as
solving the problems of others.

121
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,910
Unless it is something fundamental you need
not bother about me and you need not also

122
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,910
ask me about it.

123
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,280
You can go ahead with it.

124
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:24,940
But you must think everything in the terms
of Sahaja Yoga by which – how much, by that,

125
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,260
you are doing for Sahaja Yoga?

126
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,070
How much you are working out for Sahaja Yoga?

127
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,870
This was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis today.

128
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,520
And fundamentally we have to understand one
thing: that we have to grow and we have to

129
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,950
let others grow with our growth.

130
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,930
Not by curbing our growth, but with our growth.

131
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,810
You’ll only grow if you make others grow
with you.

132
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,640
Otherwise, there will be no growth.

133
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:59,930
Now, whatever I say goes into the books, sometimes
into the brains of the people.

134
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,530
It has to go into the heart.

135
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,500
The whole Sahaja Yoga system works on the
heart; that is the Spirit.

136
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,990
Spirit is the thing I’m talking about.

137
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,760
It’s the Spirit [that] is happy by that.

138
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,810
Some people, I am told, are using their hands
like a weapon and all that.

139
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,780
This is very dangerous!

140
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,720
You are not supposed to do all this for yourself.

141
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,310
You are still saints, you are not yet gods!

142
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,930
So don’t try such things.

143
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,720
Some people have a habit of also hitting a
person with the hand like that.

144
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,070
In my presence, if I say, it’s all right.

145
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,450
But otherwise you should not.

146
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,680
You have to respect.

147
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:57,390
Use all tender and gentle methods, never anything
by which you show any disrespect to a saint.

148
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:03,780
Of course, you are hitting the negativity
in another person, I know that.

149
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,990
But you have no business to do that or to
discard anyone or to put somebody out of this

150
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,990
thing.

151
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,720
You will go down very much.

152
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,120
This is a serious thing one must understand.

153
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,540
You have all the powers you know how far to
go.

154
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,310
You must keep to your maryadas.

155
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,920
Don’t go beyond, because these things give
you ego, and ego is the most dangerous thing

156
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,390
which we face always.

157
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,570
Try to improve your language.

158
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,130
Be gentle.

159
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,840
Be very gentle with each other.

160
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,650
I expect that you’ll have many more people
by the time I come.

161
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,240
I expect fantastic things from you.

162
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,170
I don’t know if I should but I have given
you something so fantastic, so tremendous.

163
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,690
It is unbelievable.

164
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:05,860
I expect it from you, no doubt, because you
are specially selected and I have worked with

165
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,410
you for years together.

166
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,720
You have got the tapes in English.

167
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,800
French people, poor things, they don’t have
tapes in French and they have to be translated.

168
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,130
They haven’t got a book in French and they
have big problems of understanding me.

169
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:27,360
But how dedicated they were, how deep they
are.

170
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,280
Each one of them came and said, “Mother,
I love You very much.

171
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I love You.

172
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,860
” “I have many defects and I offer myself
to You.

173
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,900
Will you accept me?”

174
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,600
All of them said this way.

175
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Just imagine!

176
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,330
I mean, I was surprised how they were saying
all these things to me and the way they were

177
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,700
understanding their defects within themselves.

178
00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:02,290
Now, we have to change our mode of behaviour
towards financial, material, emotional, physical

179
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,980
and all these things.

180
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,430
For example, say, one is married – marriages
should be successful.

181
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,450
If your marriage is not successful and happy,
you are not going to be blessed, not at all.

182
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,180
Try to make your marriage very happy and successful.

183
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,310
That’s very important.

184
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,150
Marriage is the institution established by
Adi Shakti.

185
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,550
You cannot dishonour it.

186
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,620
Do not play frivolously with your marriages.

187
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:42,570
Then you must also allow the children to be
born to you so that you get great souls coming

188
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:51,720
down on this earth by which we are giving
them a chance, a very good chance, to lead

189
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,930
a very happy life.

190
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,700
But if husbands, wives are not happy, and
even if Realised-souls are born, they have

191
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,750
a trouble with you and they do not prosper
well and they have problems.

192
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,730
So, first of all, create a family of happiness
and joy.

193
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,790
Some people think if they get away from Sahaja
Yogis, they’ll make a good, happy married

194
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,790
life.

195
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,610
It’s absolutely wrong!

196
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,070
Absolutely wrong!

197
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,529
If you cannot make a happy married life in
the ashram, you cannot make it anywhere else.

198
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,580
First try in the ashram.

199
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,870
[It’s] worth trying.

200
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,940
Otherwise, you cannot make it.

201
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,040
Because then you understand how you share
your life with others and your married life.

202
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,990
Any such thing like any material thing, like
getting a house or getting this thing, that

203
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,930
thing is not so important.

204
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,760
Your house should be clean within yourself,
your temple of your heart.

205
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,710
We are not here to build houses, not to accumulate
money.

206
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,810
We are here to build our temples within ourselves.

207
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,883
The real temples which are growing, which are the living temples of living God within us.

208
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:05,440
So these material things are important up to a point, not more than that.

209
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,582
Most important is not how you are substantiated by Sahaja Yoga but how much you have substantiated Sahaja Yoga through.

210
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,780
Many people think, “We should get a good house because we have come to Mataji.

211
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,216
Yes, you do get. You get good jobs. All right.

212
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:21,656
You get it. You get your financial conditions improved.

213
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,225
All right. Everything happens to you.

214
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:27,077
But how much have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

215
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,850
In the way: how much have you substantiated?

216
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,549
People think sometimes that if they donate money that’s sufficient. It’s not.

217
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:43,904
To enrich it with your heart, with your lovingness, with your friendship, with your sweet understanding of each other,

218
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:48,700
enjoyment of each other’s company in the purest form, not with any purpose

219
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:58,370
or with any intention of getting any low type of joy or low type of happiness from someone

220
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,820
ego-oriented or sex-oriented.

221
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,370
But it’s pure joy, pure joy.

222
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,940
Purity is the theme we have to take to.

223
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,010
We have to try to be purer and purer.

224
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:20,448
And the purity will be shown brilliantly on your faces, in your behaviour, in the whole being as you would be.

225
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:25,218
Your presence itself will show that you are Sahaja Yogis.

226
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,700
You won’t have to certify.

227
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,240
You won’t have to wear some special dresses to say, but people will know from your faces

228
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,180
that you are saints, from your behaviour.

229
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,430
You have to stand back in the last queue.

230
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,680
You should be the people who should look at things.

231
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:48,350
You should not be the first, unique, to get into the thing first, to getting into the queue first.

232
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,543
No, you are the last because you are with yourself. They are not.

233
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,930
They have not [got] their own securities.

234
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,610
They are trying to find securities in these things.

235
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,450
You have your own securities.

236
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:09,820
Change, according to the Spirit, all your priorities, and then joy is your own.

237
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:16,520
I really expect fantastic things from you and I hope you all will join together and

238
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,660
work it out and create something fantastic.

239
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,790
I don’t know how to tell individually about things but as it is I have already spoken

240
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,309
to these Sahaja Yogis in Paris and I have told them that Sahaja Yoga is a very speedy

241
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:33,309
thing.

242
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,309
And it’s very speedy.

243
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:38,560
It’s such a speed and if you do not keep with the speed of Sahaja Yoga you’ll be

244
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
thrown out.

245
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,360
You have to keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

246
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,830
Those who cannot keep by some method or other,
or [who] get locked up by something or some

247
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,180
misidentification, will drop out.

248
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,280
You’ll only grow when you will keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

249
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,600
It is going to be tremendous in India.

250
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,980
I know these five years are going to be tremendous
in Australia.

251
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,430
England may be, depending on your people putting
up the speed.

252
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,190
It’s going to be tremendously speedy and
you have to understand that – drop out all

253
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:17,240
your shackles and drop out all your misidentifications,
all nonsenses of fanaticism or of misidentifications

254
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,120
that you are British, this, that, all this.

255
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,480
And just become Sahaja Yogis and universal
beings.

256
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
It’s very important.

257
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,420
The time has come now.

258
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,260
From next year it will start.

259
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,651
So, I wish you a very Happy New Year

260
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:34,481
and a very, very happy and cheerful Christmas. May God bless you.
