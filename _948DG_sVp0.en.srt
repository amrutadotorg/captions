1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,640
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,700
everybody has said

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,610
Mother please tell us about Shri Ram

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:23,670
As you know that Shri Rama has taken
a very important place in our chakras

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,010
He is sitting on our right heart

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:38,910
Shri Rama has taken a place of a father

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:54,847
so lack of father's duty and love
can cause a catch of this chakra

8
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,513
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand
that Rama and all other gods

9
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,440
came on earth with different power (shakti),

10
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:17,530
they came to do their jobs

11
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:22,356
In the sense Shri Rama has a special job

12
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,730
Socrates has said
benevolent king has to come

13
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,212
For that Shri Rama came

14
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,350
Shri Rama came in complete human form

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,700
He even forgot that

16
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,410
he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu
 He was made to be forgotten

17
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:59,420
But he was Purushottam on earth
(perfect human being)

18
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:08,150
you all must have heard of
his qualities and his childhood

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,686
In Sahaja yoga
when we worship any god

20
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:30,800
what quality we gain from them

21
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,440
which qualities we will receive?

22
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,900
Shri Rama has many

23
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:47,910
One that he was ideal
another that he is a king

24
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,030
he kept his people higher than himself

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,000
than his wife and children

26
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:06,290
If politicians today

27
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,840
understand this point

28
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,940
they wouldn't be called selfish

29
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,130
they wouldn't be selfish

30
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,480
would be follower of Dharma.

31
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,720
Nobody has followed

32
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,720
Shri Rama as a role model
till today

33
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,680
By singing his bhajans

34
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:38,901
or building an institutions and temples
in his name

35
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:44,380
Shri Rama come to you?

36
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,120
Do you get his light in your life?

37
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:57,416
Only sahaj yogi can bring the light
of Shri Rama into the attention

38
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:02,306
He is totally beyond

39
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,105
Basically all the deities are
free from papas and punyas

40
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,285
so called sins
they never sin

41
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,645
Shri Krishna killed many people

42
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:20,933
Shri Rama killed Ravana

43
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:25,895
It can be a sin in worldly sense

44
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,005
but not in the eyes of god

45
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:41,240
As they destroy and remove evils
they have rights to do anything

46
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:49,350
When Devi slayed Rakshas
she has committed a sin?

47
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:58,899
Their work is to destroy the
rakshas and protect the saints

48
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:10,465
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is
the most important

49
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:14,336
she was cursed by her husband

50
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:19,902
In those times if any women
goes out of dharma

51
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:26,215
and if her husband is high saint
he could curse

52
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:32,075
But Ahillya was blamed falsely

53
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:37,481
And she was made into stone falsely

54
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,710
So shri Rama saved Ahilya

55
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:55,779
Especially his quality to have only one wife

56
00:05:56,263 --> 00:06:01,103
his love to one wife must be understood

57
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:09,185
Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi
she herself is a Goddess

58
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:18,745
But as a Human he never looked
 at any other women but his wife

59
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,269
When we talk about Rama
we should have the husband pure

60
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:28,433
To worships shri Rama

61
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:38,825
Women should have the same faith
in husbands as Sitaji used to

62
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:45,103
Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram
who believed one wife

63
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:48,055
Not difficult for sahaja yogis

64
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,030
Women should be respected
 Have respect for wifes

65
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040
When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

66
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,705
Shri Rama felt his duty
 to rescue her

67
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:10,330
But in his kingdom
he was so just that

68
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,670
For people he left her
after spending so many years to rescue

69
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,820
As Sitaji herself a Devi
 so there's no effect

70
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,706
So Shri Rama did it

71
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:33,227
to keep the benevolence
of public opinion

72
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:37,340
that society wouln't accpect the women

73
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:43,330
who are questioned.

74
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:49,788
Although she is a Devi
Pure and Nirmala

75
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:54,216
Later that
Sita also left him somehow

76
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,915
She left him as a woman
and Shri Rama as a man

77
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:09,234
Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth
and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

78
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:16,318
Their life is very eventful
 and full of Miracles

79
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:25,817
You see how shri Sita and Rama
have good attitude and are faithful each other

80
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:31,895
Even if she was left
Sita thought it her duty

81
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:37,985
She never complained
or talked ill of him

82
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:44,467
And effortlessly
she has raised her children

83
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:50,632
Shri Rama's children are
called Luv and Kush

84
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:59,534
They came as devotees
and we can see them as disciples

85
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,770
They represents Shisya (disciples)

86
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:10,770
the power of Shisya
so we can be disciple of someone

87
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,800
As disciples they learned archery
when they were small

88
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:24,218
And learned Ramayana
and got proficiency in the music

89
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:32,115
Showing the disciples must surrender completely
to the Guru

90
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,745
We also have a disciples in us

91
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:44,228
They were  completely surrendered to
 the Mother who is Shakti

92
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,180
Even they were about to fight
against Shri Rama

93
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:53,680
they kept Mother highest in the world

94
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,350
The mother cared them
and made them completely dharmic

95
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,270
It was her first duty

96
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,330
Not like today wives just cry
"my husband left me"

97
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:14,323
But with husband they fight always
and if he leaves they will cry

98
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:23,117
He has left no problem
I have children, I will care for them

99
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,110
they will get all they need

100
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:37,890
Sitaj's life was special
with bravery and strength

101
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,810
Every woman must have it

102
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,880
Even if you are separated with your
husband or far away

103
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:53,680
there shouldn't be any loss
or shortage for children

104
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:59,353
Because her duty
is the most important thing

105
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,698
We shouldn't give up
most important thing

106
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:09,455
In sahaja yoga
all women should get this power

107
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,650
Shri Rama's life was
very pure and Nirmal

108
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,720
he gave up everything
for his wife

109
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:30,000
His wife had gone, he had to live alone
and he had to leave her

110
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,360
He gave up all the comforts of the life

111
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:41,560
You know he used to sleep
on grass, on floor and walked barefeet

112
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,156
and wear clothes like saints

113
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,930
All these are not stories
it's a fact

114
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:57,030
In India many people used to have
high standard life

115
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,850
and they have never thought about
 small and low level things

116
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:09,946
But all these ideals of our country
have beccome fake

117
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:16,765
By singing bhajans to Ram
 we think we are done

118
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:19,895
we have got a kind of hypocracy

119
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:23,727
In countries without
these ideals

120
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:29,095
people try to become the ideals
correcting themselves

121
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:33,886
If you have the ideal in front of us

122
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,240
you don't  become Shri Rama or Krishna

123
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,780
or you have anything to do with them

124
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,110
We feel like that

125
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,733
But if we have Shri Rama inside
his light can be in our attention

126
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:52,828
Let's understand

127
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:59,371
the circumstances when
Shri Rama came on earth

128
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,993
Sahaja Yogi must understand

129
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:12,000
If we get Shri Rama's state
All our political problems will go

130
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,083
when we decide to
become like shri Rama

131
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:36,300
Then everyone becomes good

132
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:47,830
firstly dharma, success and education
then the ideals

133
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,970
for that he made his life very idealistic

134
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,950
When someone tells you something
but he doesn't do it himself

135
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,532
Then how can you trust him and get his quality

136
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:10,790
There are many people who say
we believe in this and that

137
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,760
But they are opposite

138
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:22,694
Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician
and they have many wives, impossible

139
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,390
What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life?

140
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,871
we have to bring the light of god
in our attention

141
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:39,555
We must see and behave as Shri Rama

142
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:47,198
What would Shri Rama or Sita do
in this situation

143
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:52,875
What would Sita ji say?

144
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,154
How would Sita behave?
She is also Gruhlaxmi

145
00:14:57,265 --> 00:15:02,780
As you know Sitaji took many births

146
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:09,350
Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi

147
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:16,535
She was humbly in the house but all
dharma was done by her power

148
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:22,845
Not necessary for her to go out
and give big lectures

149
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:32,730
You can do that work at home
with children relatives and friends

150
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:37,620
you can spread sahaja Yoga at the house

151
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,850
After getting all of it
 you can go out to society

152
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:52,340
But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first

153
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,600
First thing of the purity is
motherhood and love

154
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:03,230
When she was in exile never complained
 that my husband doesn't earn

155
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,445
He doesn't do this
he doesn't buy this and that

156
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:13,500
If he is in jungle so I am
What he will eat I wil

157
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:18,307
I don't eat before him
I serve him first

158
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:22,671
and  brother in law then I will eat

159
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:36,750
Nowadays women think there is
much pressure of the work But it is not

160
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:43,706
A woman is like earth element
she can absorb

161
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:48,652
So many are given by the earth

162
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:53,460
In the same way
women are like the earth

163
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:58,511
We have got so many powers
 that we can take everything inside

164
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:04,892
and shower the rain of love
God has given us the power

165
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:14,842
For example this fan is moving
Which one is greater, the power or fan?

166
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,230
If you think fan is greater as  it's moving
Then it's wrong

167
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,570
Women are ocean of shakti

168
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:32,445
With that support Men does their work

169
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:39,709
They are potential and kinetic
Women are potential and men are kinetic

170
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:45,025
But if you start running like them

171
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:48,375
It's not good
No need for women

172
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:58,056
Each one is unique but equally important
But women can be good for both

173
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:02,695
When the time comes
women can be more productive

174
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,230
In Maharashtra
there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai

175
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,640
She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji

176
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,070
Only she could defeat Aurangzeb

177
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,175
Her grave was built

178
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:34,789
You must understand women can keep all her
power within her to become ferocious

179
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:47,210
But  if she waste her powers in
fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things

180
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,340
then her power would be gone

181
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:58,640
Women are so powerful that
she can work more than men if she want

182
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,117
But first of all
she must respect her powers

183
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:08,303
by scattering and wasting she becomes powerless

184
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:10,954
this kind of woman is not good

185
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:18,214
Women's job is very important and full of dignity

186
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:22,901
Women should be very modest and very wise

187
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:27,795
Let Men use bad words but women cannot

188
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:34,459
Men can argue and would fight
let them do but not Women

189
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:42,483
Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people

190
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:50,170
She is like shield not like sword
and sword cannot be shield

191
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:57,120
Shield is greater than sword
as shield can bear the sword

192
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:01,590
Sword can be broken
but not shield

193
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:10,210
So her most important power is humility

194
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,220
With humility comes all the powers

195
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,050
It's not difficult for sahaj yogis
not at all

196
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,120
I see many sahaja yoginis chat a lot

197
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,820
anywhere they will chat with men

198
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,110
"Mother help me" "what happened"

199
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,670
"The lady talks a lot please help me"

200
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,595
"I am tired of her"

201
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:43,851
There isn't much to talk with men
What's the need?

202
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:47,453
Among women also

203
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:53,115
In sahaja yoga men study more

204
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:55,475
About Sahaja Yoga and the chakras

205
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:03,370
Which chakra is driving people and is catching?

206
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,260
Man knows all
women would be left behind

207
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,172
Women must learn

208
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:15,735
For men Shri Rama is our ideal

209
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,435
In this sense Muslims are amazing

210
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,865
I don't want to say bad things

211
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:31,550
Say if you go to Riyad
no  Muslim will see you

212
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,180
they will respect women
If women are crossing the street

213
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,350
they will stop the car
respecting women

214
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,220
But here it's opposite
I don't know why

215
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,780
we see women with some intention

216
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,870
Seeing every woman
 they will break the neck

217
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,390
It's a big sin to see every woman

218
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:03,289
In sahaja yoga it's prohibited completely

219
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:08,585
Firstly you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga

220
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,630
Otherwise you may become blind

221
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,740
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes

222
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:22,115
While talking eyes are wandering
women too

223
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,430
The biggest loss is your attention

224
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,670
Your attention goes here and there

225
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:35,055
then what's the use of self-realization

226
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:41,390
Without concentration Chitta can't be active

227
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,580
Concentration must be obtained

228
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:51,253
In the west the disease is
more common among men

229
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:57,185
Western yogis are not alike
They know it's bad

230
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,300
They asked me the solution

231
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:10,815
Look at only ground and up to 3 feets
you don't have to see above

232
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:19,210
Look at the ground
Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad

233
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:29,380
You see all good things, flowers and children
Nothing to see above

234
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,920
So, that's how you should control your chitta

235
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,780
Shri Rama didn't need it
If you have a respect to shri Rama

236
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:43,505
You must control your chitta like him

237
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:54,778
Tell your wife you respect her as shakti
But she has to deserve it

238
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:59,155
"Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata"

239
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:09,994
"Where women are respected resides
god" But they have to be respectable

240
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,788
Please sit down

241
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:18,780
Don't move during Puja

242
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:24,520
If the woman is worshipable
"Pujyante" means "worshipable"

243
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:32,670
Who like to worship a bad woman
cruel Rakshasi?

244
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:40,030
Those who are worshpable should be worshipped
There resides gods

245
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,936
Firstly they are mothers of children

246
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:49,984
If husband scolds wife in front of children

247
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,540
then children will never respect mother

248
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:58,675
It's prime minister and deputy minister

249
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,760
Women shouldn't insult her husband too

250
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,710
Power goes to children from father

251
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:18,167
Without this basic understanding
they fight to take control

252
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:22,690
If woman knows handling of man
there won't be any fights

253
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:28,970
Handling men is very easy
as they are just like children

254
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,655
they are innocent like children

255
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:38,295
By talking nonsense
 you can't handle them

256
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,564
You must forgive them as children

257
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:45,355
If they fight outside
they get troubled

258
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,820
They can get angry only to wife

259
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:51,905
Getting angry at home is OK

260
00:25:51,930 --> 00:26:01,067
Until you get this feeling, you cannot have
 mutual understanding, love and joy

261
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:07,162
Men also should care for wife's needs

262
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:19,145
if wife is wrong, husband has duty to say no
"It's wrong, I won't do this"

263
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:25,565
But no need to fight on small things
It doesn't look good as sahaja yogis

264
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,320
I am surprised that
Sahaja couples fight each other

265
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,250
They come to complain about each other

266
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:44,475
How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully
while I'm talking about peace to the whole world

267
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,760
It won't work out if you are fighting like that

268
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:55,919
Husband has to have complete
understanding of his wife first

269
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:04,570
And know that all the other women
are like your sisters and mothers

270
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:09,375
If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga
then there's no way out

271
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:14,405
There was a swiss man
not a Sahaja Yogi

272
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:20,310
Not Indian
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini

273
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:27,155
Girl's husband had wandering
eyes but came to sahaja yoga

274
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:35,178
They both came to Sahaja Yoga
The girl is very good but he went on doing it

275
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:40,480
The non-yogi father told her to leave him

276
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,840
"Even after sahaja yoga if he can't be cleansed
then leave him"

277
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,980
"He is not a Sahaja Yogi don't relate with him"

278
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:04,020
Even Non-Sahaja Yogi can understand
that the person can't be cleansed

279
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,830
He doesn't have stable attention
then it is bad

280
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:18,390
Our culture is that men and women
must be brother and sister

281
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:25,350
But I see a talkative woman
just go to talk to men

282
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:34,060
I don't understand it
They don't sit with other ladies but with men

283
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,735
Same with men just start chatting with women

284
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:49,905
Even with maid or anyone
just start talking, no self-esteem

285
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:57,350
We think it's masculinity but Shri Rama is
the perfect man who is highest

286
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,350
But the one at the bottom
think they are perfect

287
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:08,630
Where is perfection?
Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil

288
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,280
If you believe in Shri Rama
follow his ideal

289
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,716
Therefore children and women
are getting spoiled

290
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:23,230
But still Indian women maintained
good culture here

291
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:33,050
If they were like Americans what it would have been
Men are fixed in terrible condition there

292
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:46,650
After 2-3 marriages Men becomes
bunkrupt but women make a palace

293
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,680
It's bad in America
Children are running away from home

294
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:59,820
Indian woman manage their house
husband and children

295
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,695
But it's changing
They think the same like husbands

296
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,120
If he runs away with 10 women
then we go with 15 men

297
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,970
If he is going to hell then I go before him

298
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:22,305
Women shouldn't do it
The base of dharma is in woman's hand

299
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:29,925
Woman must manage husband dharmic
making him understand

300
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:35,527
This is the biggest duty and power
of woman to be Dharmaic

301
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:43,190
Biggest dharma is forgiveness
Without it nothing works out

302
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,440
First thing she must have forgiveness
Forgive children, husband

303
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,900
give refuge to house servants
all are her duty

304
00:30:52,925 --> 00:31:03,521
This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do
neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus

305
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:16,690
Rama would have killed everyone
who is useless, adharmic and flirt

306
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,100
Don't know how many he would be finished

307
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,710
Krishna would use his sudarshan
chakra and there would be a battle

308
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,945
Christ would crucify himself

309
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:35,215
One crucifiction is better than everyday

310
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,370
Only Mother can do this work
 With such a power of love

311
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,943
Anything can be worked out with her power of love

312
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:52,600
She holds everything with so much love
that children don't mind correcting

313
00:31:52,600 --> 00:32:00,040
For instance when trouble comes only mother
knows how to handle it and scold later

314
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,260
Because children understands mother's love
and it is for them

315
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:12,970
With father children may react
but not with mother's love without expectation

316
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:22,105
She doesn't want anything but her children to be good
and get all my powers, all good in me

317
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:27,165
If mother feels it children will be fine

318
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:34,640
But some mothers are very interfering
and get involved in everything

319
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,970
She comes always in front
while husband is at the back

320
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,970
Children will be spoiled by it

321
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:50,043
Under such harmful environment children
can be very emotional

322
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:55,195
So woman should be behind
and make her husband in front

323
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,880
Whatever husbands do
wifes must help him behind

324
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:09,270
The source of his power is wife
Then how pure and hard-working she should be

325
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:16,100
I put everything on woman
because I know you have great powers inside

326
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:21,090
Look at me as a Mother
I must make everyone saints

327
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:26,020
Curing many diseases
to make people saints

328
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:31,170
Did anyone do this job?
Only Ahilya was saved

329
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,435
Jesus saved 21 people

330
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:37,715
I must have saved 21000 now

331
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,745
Going around the world to do
everyone's job

332
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:49,435
it's still going on but I don't feel
because of love

333
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:56,480
Maybe I should put bandhan
as I don't know what kind of people I meet

334
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,960
But as soon as people comes to me
 I absorb all the problems

335
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,485
So love acts by itself
I know everything is done by love

336
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:15,463
I don't feel bad whatever happens
Only Mother can bear the pain

337
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:24,040
So I want you to grow consistantly
without hurdles

338
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:32,500
Also men should help their wives fully
Understand and respect them

339
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:41,811
Until the 2 wheels gets balanced
the chariot doesn't go forward

340
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:49,625
They both should be the same but
one on the left and the other on the right

341
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,510
It won't work if you change it

342
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:07,935
It is moving and working
because they are the same but unique

343
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:22,910
Same in the sense of height
length and width but they work differently

344
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,960
It's the same in our life

345
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:39,940
Shri Rama didn't think
only about husband and wife

346
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:45,630
Didn't think only about children and family

347
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:54,645
Also of brother, sister, mother, father
and everyone as a normal human being

348
00:35:54,645 --> 00:36:01,195
After he thought about society

349
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:07,380
About public, state and country

350
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:18,730
As a human being he has shown
human ideals in his activities

351
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:28,960
The person who loved his wife so much
knew she was pure and hed left her

352
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:40,755
Now people give so much to their own wife
but they never give to poor people

353
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,645
Otherwise they give to their relatives
It's a disease among politicians

354
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:56,415
But the one who has wife who is sakshat
devi had to leave her

355
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:04,980
We must understand it's attachment
to relatives and possessions

356
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:12,300
In west marriage relation wasn't alright
but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything

357
00:37:12,325 --> 00:37:20,188
Here leaders had to leave
because their wives were not alright

358
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,770
Their attention got spoiled
by wife's preaching

359
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,019
At least five yogi left
 because of their wives

360
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:40,510
Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga
and their role in it

361
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,250
In this case husbands shouldn't
agree with their wives at all

362
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,210
Tell her that “You talk and move
too much, Be quiet"

363
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,630
You are useless
Your chakras are not alright

364
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,755
She will be alright only in this way

365
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:07,060
But instead you blame yourself
and obey your wife?

366
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:10,155
If she tells you to steal, you do it?

367
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:18,670
Even after Sahaja Yoga you still
have some catches to take care

368
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:29,670
On the occasion of Shri Rama
Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee

369
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,150
And how he was busy at his service

370
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:46,145
He was aware that his life is
for serving Shri Rama

371
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:53,325
We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga

372
00:38:53,350 --> 00:39:00,090
But it doesn't mean you cook food for
me which I don't eat

373
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:06,425
You trouble me cooking so much
this and that

374
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:12,425
Don't keep on serving someone forcefully

375
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:18,610
What we need is zeal to serve (Sewa)

376
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,105
Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama

377
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:25,508
Delhi people kept on
serving food so much

378
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:31,360
that I had to tell them
I wouln't come if you don't stop

379
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:35,310
Do what you have to do

380
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:39,572
It's bad to force someone to eat

381
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:43,195
serving one after another

382
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,260
I don't need anything
and I am tired

383
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:55,039
I told you only flowers
But don't spend too much also

384
00:39:55,125 --> 00:40:02,725
A lot of flowers make me
worry sometimes

385
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:11,027
Please your Mother in balance
She is a simple woman who don't understand these

386
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:19,055
We have to learn that zeal to serve is
from Hanuman ji

387
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,020
There is no special service for me

388
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:31,135
But if you want to serve me
 serve to Sahaj Yoga

389
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,340
Serving to Sahaja Yoga is
serving to me

390
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,920
How many realisation have you given

391
00:40:40,945 --> 00:40:44,444
How many did you transform and inspire

392
00:40:44,563 --> 00:40:50,900
But if you say to new people
they have bhoot, they just leave

393
00:40:50,925 --> 00:41:01,760
One gentleman was told he has
3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga

394
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,560
he was told number of bhoots even

395
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:13,344
he believed it because the Yogi
was an authority in the local area

396
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:17,860
I don't know who
but the person left

397
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:24,300
So what we have to learn
from Hanuman is the zeal

398
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,180
" Ram kaj karne ko tatpar"
(eager to do Ram's work)

399
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,720
What is our work?
My work is sahaj yoga

400
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,070
My work is sahaj yoga
 To raise kundalini

401
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,813
To make people peaceful and lovable
talking about love

402
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:55,270
Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras
Make them understand

403
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,480
Doesn't mean you start giving lecture
Some people started to give so much lecture

404
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,140
I had to tell them to stop
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished

405
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:16,030
Only long lectures
No time for Mother's talk and Aarti

406
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,945
He said he just can't stop

407
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:25,275
He doesn't know why
"How can I fix it?"

408
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:28,765
"You put supari (spice) in your mouth"

409
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,760
Then "How much?"

410
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,620
"It depends on the size of your mouth"

411
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:43,450
"You don't know it even then
how come you talk aobut Sahaja Yoga"

412
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,950
you don't know it even

413
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,500
People like giving lecture

414
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:56,120
Get on a stage and won't leave a mic

415
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:02,100
Once with mic they cant't leave
It's a new disease

416
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:08,850
So you must understand
why to give lecture

417
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:17,800
There are so many Mother's talk
you can put a tape or video in every program

418
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:30,670
After people can write question on paper
And ask them to bring it next program

419
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,970
If there are someone
who is sick or in trouble

420
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:41,780
Now there is a Yogi
He comes to cure in Calcutta

421
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:49,230
Now he was called to Russia

422
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,572
One person is running like
Hanuman all over to cure

423
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:58,957
You all can cure
All women can do

424
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:02,364
All men also
But nobody tries

425
00:44:02,618 --> 00:44:06,920
By giving lecture how many were cured?

426
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:08,555
I don't know why only one in India

427
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:09,055
don't know what's the matter
 that till now there is only one man in India
 who can cure people

428
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:20,160
In London there are 15~20 people
who can cure and in France also

429
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,502
One should learn working on people
like giving bandhan

430
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:37,300
No need to invite someone from abroad
Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure

431
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,275
How do you work on others
if you can't cure even yourself

432
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:48,315
Everybody has got
all the power to cure anyone

433
00:44:48,315 --> 00:44:52,200
Learn to become masters

434
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,170
Instead of inviting someone
They should go out to cure

435
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:02,693
Just have some courage to work
Nothing will happen

436
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:12,512
By working, you become deeper like
a tree grows deeper as it expands

437
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:20,925
Sahaja Yogis are very much different
from Incarnations

438
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:26,010
They have never worked in society before

439
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,440
Nobody had the power for a mass

440
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:36,325
Only one to one
Like King Janaka to Nachiketa

441
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:45,585
But now you all have it
Just grow it, that's all

442
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:52,470
Cure yourself and others
Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything

443
00:45:52,525 --> 00:45:58,190
But still your attention is wondering
What are you running after?

444
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:04,838
You still don't understand it
Sahaja Yoga is just blessing

445
00:46:04,918 --> 00:46:09,190
You won't be in short of anything

446
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:14,590
Just work for sahaja Yoga
Even if you don't work you will be blessed

447
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:20,720
Business or promotion,
this and that

448
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:27,563
Everyone is blessed and
nothing to give up

449
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:33,243
Otherwise in time of freedom fight

450
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:39,486
we were tortured
Lied on ice, got electric shocks

451
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:44,015
My parents went to jail
Our house was sold

452
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:51,780
Lived in a hut... had to sacrifice a lot
And you don't have to do it

453
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,750
But not only recieving
You have to give

454
00:46:56,756 --> 00:47:04,088
If one door is open so should be the other one
Only one doesn't work

455
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:10,816
Everyone reports me
about blessings they got

456
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:19,010
We must see what we have done for others

457
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:31,520
But there are many fights for leadership
It's all mother's play

458
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:35,670
You will know it when you will fall from there

459
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:42,399
Specially women shouldn't get involved
They fall very soon

460
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:47,390
And men should know
there is nothing like ministers

461
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:51,025
This is Mother's play
Don't get involved in

462
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:59,037
Why I call a leader? It's a play
There are no leaders

463
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:07,780
It's just a test if you have ego
If you have, you are gone

464
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:14,550
It will be shown immediately
In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed

465
00:48:14,582 --> 00:48:19,453
Even if I say something
 it shows on the faces

466
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:27,192
Once some leaders came and
confessed their mistakes

467
00:48:27,248 --> 00:48:36,860
They have more responsibilities to be
better, sweet, humble and loving

468
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,250
and become close and sharing with everyone

469
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:50,320
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama
we must understand what he had showen

470
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:56,272
Only a bit of it would please our Mother

471
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:07,445
He was in exile for a long time in Jungle
Walked barefeet, worked so hard

472
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,395
Just to obey his father

473
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:15,405
Now to obey me
you don't need to go into exile

474
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:20,690
Not barefeet, nor starving nothing
All are there for you

475
00:49:20,806 --> 00:49:27,290
But you must know how to cure people
in Sahaja Yoga

476
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,770
everything about sahaj yoga

477
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:35,455
and mostly about love

478
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:43,240
it's nothing but power of love
Everybody will be benefited

479
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:49,770
This is not only for special people

480
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:56,983
This is not only for one country
but for the whole world

481
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:06,290
Watch how your attention is
If it's disturbed we should correct it

482
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:13,480
Put the power of spirit in it
Do everything with concentration

483
00:50:13,584 --> 00:50:20,123
And devotion and love will
make you deep

484
00:50:20,123 --> 00:50:27,013
Otherwise there is lots of rubbish

485
00:50:27,038 --> 00:50:34,939
If you wish to stay like rubbish
you know where it goes at the end

486
00:50:35,026 --> 00:50:39,770
If you want to feel you are
specially good capable of anything

487
00:50:39,985 --> 00:50:45,969
First humility, not only towards me
but everyone

488
00:50:46,136 --> 00:50:58,848
Talk humbly with love and show that
people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga

489
00:50:58,951 --> 00:51:01,445
to spread fragrance everywhere

490
00:51:01,445 --> 00:51:10,050
People will tell me you are wonderful
if you will do it in that way

491
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:15,171
One day you too will be called as
Maryada Purushottama

492
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:21,232
You are the temple of Rama
so have it within yourself

493
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,319
Perform puja to it
Take care of your self-esteem

494
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:36,808
Take the benefit of self-realization
inside yourself

495
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:41,440
You must have respect and devotion to it

496
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:49,738
"Now we are realized"
"How can we do wrong, we are yogi"

497
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:56,430
Soon you will have blessings
immediately

498
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:02,568
As I am called Rokra devi, you will get
blessing as soon as you assert it

499
00:52:02,814 --> 00:52:12,220
Everyone is getting blessed with it
give it back to the world

500
00:52:12,245 --> 00:52:25,955
Shri Rama used all his powers for the
benevolence of people to show the ideal

501
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:33,855
You will be surprised to achieve so high
when the time comes

502
00:52:33,865 --> 00:52:41,875
You won't have any disease and
all bad habits will be dropped

503
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:50,085
You will eat, talk and watch
as much as you need

504
00:52:50,133 --> 00:53:02,462
You will watch your mind
for introspection

505
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:13,248
"Where is my mind going?"
"I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it"

506
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:18,046
By doing so
you will be in meditation

507
00:53:18,071 --> 00:53:24,403
Your kundalini will be satisfied
and give you blessings

508
00:53:24,428 --> 00:53:27,408
You say,
"Mother what a blessing"

509
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:32,283
But you have to jump into it
Only then will you know it

510
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:36,755
Till then you need to work hard

511
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:42,835
Shri Rama was born
at midnight so let's have puja late

512
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:49,922
Shri Rama Puja is not
a specially long one

513
00:53:50,103 --> 00:54:01,834
As he is in a human form
he is humanity within us

514
00:54:02,086 --> 00:54:14,595
by which we understand our intellect
and our thoughts get changed

515
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:21,890
Shri Rama is that
Through him we can change our thoughts

516
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:28,060
Our nature can change
Because he is our ideal

517
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:35,481
After achieving his ideals we reach another
because he was human ideal

518
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:41,710
It is great that God came to this world
in a human form to became our ideal

519
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:51,515
He has gone through all the hardships
to show us strength to keep Dharma

520
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:56,223
That is Vishwa Dharma
and the state of yoga

521
00:54:56,834 --> 00:55:00,850
May God bless you all
