00:06.940 --> 00:10.140
Keep your eyes open.

00:14.700 --> 00:19.140
Now all the children should put their hands link this.

00:19.340 --> 00:21.060
All right?

00:21.260 --> 00:23.700
And watch Me.

01:00.340 --> 01:06.220
Lift your tongues and put them back

01:06.420 --> 01:09.900
as much as possible.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.620
Turn it backward.

01:17.220 --> 01:21.380
Let it feel the bliss of the Divine on its tip.

01:31.900 --> 01:38.260
Now put your chin down, touching your…

01:38.460 --> 01:41.500
don’t close your eyes.

01:44.460 --> 01:47.980
In complete surrender,

01:49.700 --> 01:51.940
put the chin.

01:57.140 --> 02:00.500
But don’t close your eyes.

02:05.180 --> 02:08.980
Pay attention to your Sahasrara.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.900
Loosen your hands fully on the sides,

02:19.100 --> 02:23.620
make them loose. Sit straight.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.260
Do not touch the palate.

03:00.260 --> 03:03.060
Now breathe in.

03:04.780 --> 03:07.660
Do not push back the tongue. Keep the tongue where it is.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.620
Breathe in.

03:16.900 --> 03:22.540
Now raise your stomach, without taking out the breath, upward,

03:22.740 --> 03:27.380
pushing the air upward towards the lungs.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.580
Push your stomach in.

03:37.420 --> 03:41.500
Attention on the Sahasrara.

03:53.540 --> 03:57.580
You start seeing light through Sahasrara.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.580
Sort of the Sahasrara becomes like eyes.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.900
Now leave it.

04:15.100 --> 04:18.060
Leave it now.

04:19.580 --> 04:21.740
Raise your head.

04:28.140 --> 04:31.420
Now put back your heads.

04:32.220 --> 04:34.060
Put the fingers [in the ears].

04:34.260 --> 04:36.260
Put the attention to your Sahasrara, that’s all.

04:36.420 --> 04:39.340
Don’t say anything, no mantras.

04:42.940 --> 04:46.140
Take out your tongue,

04:46.340 --> 04:49.260
push it back.

04:51.180 --> 04:54.020
Take in your breath.

04:55.220 --> 04:57.500
Push the stomach.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.340
That’s good.

05:26.220 --> 05:35.020
Now watch Me continuously without blinking.

05:38.700 --> 05:42.140
Without any pressure on the eyes.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.740
Attention on the Sahasrara.

06:47.420 --> 06:51.660
You can do it without blinking.

07:03.180 --> 07:06.060
May God bless you.

07:06.940 --> 07:13.260
This is it, physically, we have worked out our attention,

07:16.740 --> 07:20.660
on our Vishuddhi and on our Agnya.

07:29.260 --> 07:32.620
The left Vishuddhi is still there.

07:34.180 --> 07:40.100
Now put your head more on the right side,

07:40.300 --> 07:43.340
loose, like this.

07:44.620 --> 07:48.740
With the attention on the Sahasrara, looking at Me.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.380
Put it loose.

07:55.220 --> 07:58.300
Hand to be loose.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.620
Loosen it.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.300
Now better.

08:24.820 --> 08:28.420
You feel the Kundalini rising?

08:30.620 --> 08:36.460
Let us put ourselves into bandhan after raising our Kundalini.

08:36.660 --> 08:38.940
Raise.

08:40.180 --> 08:43.140
Attention on your Sahasrara. Don’t close your eyes,

08:43.340 --> 08:45.380
push back your head.

08:45.580 --> 08:47.380
One.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.260
Again.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.780
Sit straight.

08:53.340 --> 08:56.260
Take it up on your head.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.140
Two…

09:11.140 --> 09:12.900
three.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.660
Now a bandhan.

09:16.260 --> 09:18.500
One,

09:20.140 --> 09:21.620
two.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.180
Do it properly, systematically.

09:24.380 --> 09:27.700
Three. All of us should do properly. Three…

09:27.900 --> 09:30.100
four…

09:31.740 --> 09:33.260
five…

09:33.660 --> 09:35.740
Try to wait as I am doing it…

09:35.980 --> 09:38.020
six…

09:40.660 --> 09:42.460
seven.

09:45.940 --> 09:48.020
Still we have not done it properly.

09:48.220 --> 09:53.420
We all should do in one rhythm. Let’s do it again.

09:53.580 --> 09:56.380
One. slowly…

09:59.900 --> 10:03.220
two, with attention on the Sahasrara…

10:04.660 --> 10:07.340
three…How do I do it? …

10:08.460 --> 10:10.060
four…

10:12.340 --> 10:14.380
five…good…

10:15.900 --> 10:17.340
six.

10:18.100 --> 10:21.260
Attention on Sahasrara…seven.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.820
Rising?

10:29.900 --> 10:32.420
Let’s have the last binding…

10:40.020 --> 10:41.500
Now see.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.060
Clear?

10:57.260 --> 10:59.220
Tremendous.

11:01.180 --> 11:03.220
May God bless you.
