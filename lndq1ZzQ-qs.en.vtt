00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.140
Keep your eyes open.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
Now all the children should put their hands link this.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.060
All right?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.700
And watch Me.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.220
Lift your tongues and put them back

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.900
as much as possible.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.620
Turn it backward.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.380
Let it feel the bliss of the Divine on its tip.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.260
Now put your chin down, touching your…

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.500
don’t close your eyes.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.980
In complete surrender,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.940
put the chin.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.500
But don’t close your eyes.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.980
Pay attention to your Sahasrara.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.900
Loosen your hands fully on the sides,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.620
make them loose. Sit straight.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.260
Do not touch the palate.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.060
Now breathe in.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.660
Do not push back the tongue. Keep the tongue where it is.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.620
Breathe in.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.540
Now raise your stomach, without taking out the breath, upward,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.380
pushing the air upward towards the lungs.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.580
Push your stomach in.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.500
Attention on the Sahasrara.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.580
You start seeing light through Sahasrara.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.580
Sort of the Sahasrara becomes like eyes.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.900
Now leave it.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.060
Leave it now.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.740
Raise your head.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.420
Now put back your heads.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.060
Put the fingers [in the ears].

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
Put the attention to your Sahasrara, that’s all.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.340
Don’t say anything, no mantras.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.140
Take out your tongue,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.260
push it back.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.020
Take in your breath.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.500
Push the stomach.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.340
That’s good.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:35.020
Now watch Me continuously without blinking.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.140
Without any pressure on the eyes.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.740
Attention on the Sahasrara.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.660
You can do it without blinking.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.060
May God bless you.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:13.260
This is it, physically, we have worked out our attention,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.660
on our Vishuddhi and on our Agnya.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.620
The left Vishuddhi is still there.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.100
Now put your head more on the right side,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.340
loose, like this.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.740
With the attention on the Sahasrara, looking at Me.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.380
Put it loose.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.300
Hand to be loose.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.620
Loosen it.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.300
Now better.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.420
You feel the Kundalini rising?

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.460
Let us put ourselves into bandhan after raising our Kundalini.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.940
Raise.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.140
Attention on your Sahasrara. Don’t close your eyes,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.380
push back your head.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.380
One.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.260
Again.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.780
Sit straight.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.260
Take it up on your head.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.140
Two…

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.900
three.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.660
Now a bandhan.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.500
One,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.620
two.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.180
Do it properly, systematically.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.700
Three. All of us should do properly. Three…

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.100
four…

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.260
five…

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.740
Try to wait as I am doing it…

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.020
six…

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.460
seven.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.020
Still we have not done it properly.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.420
We all should do in one rhythm. Let’s do it again.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.380
One. slowly…

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.220
two, with attention on the Sahasrara…

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.340
three…How do I do it? …

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.060
four…

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.380
five…good…

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.340
six.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.260
Attention on Sahasrara…seven.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.820
Rising?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.420
Let’s have the last binding…

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.500
Now see.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.060
Clear?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.220
Tremendous.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.220
May God bless you.
