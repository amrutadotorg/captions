00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:30.423
Its very interesting the way you have found out

00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:34.757
today is the real Guru Purnima.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:39.757
The Purnima is the day when the moon is full.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.840
I knew this but for Sahaja Yogis we have to arrange

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.132
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Friday,Saturday, Sunday.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:54.340
Whenever it is, whether it is on that date or not,we have to arrange

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:55.257
so it in that case,

00:00:55.465 --> 00:01:04.757
this time it was I think two days before So it doesn't matter,

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.049
after all, moon is there for us and we are for moon,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.257
so it can't be some thing that would have very wrong in it.

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:29.757
I have already told you such a lot about the Guru principle.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.049
And the guru principle,

00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:38.257
we have seen people who came on this Earth

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.257
they were all mostly born realised

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:45.840
actually, and they never gave realisation to anyone

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.340
it's a very big difference.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:55.257
They were all born as realised souls and they  became Sufis

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.257
and they are called by different names,

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:04.465
but they were not given self realisation, they had it

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.840
and because of their self realisation as they had,

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.340
they have so much of knowledge

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:15.965
and that is  what they try to impart to people.

00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:21.840
They knew all about Chakras everything they knew,

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:28.840
somehow, must be in their past life achievements that they knew it,

00:02:29.174 --> 00:02:37.049
perhaps some of them were disciples of  other very great people.

00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:41.381
I don't know how they had full ideas to

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:46.257
what is self realisation is

00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:50.882
what do we achieve after self realisation .

00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:55.965
Now the only person, I think, Mohammed Sahib, is the one

00:02:56.257 --> 00:03:01.673
who has talked about Miraj is the ascent

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:06.257
Miraj is the ascent through our Kundalini.

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:09.465
Of course in India they did talked about it,

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:13.257
but in any other country they didn't say it so clearly

00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:15.965
that there is something called Miraj.

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:19.673
And, not only that He talked of Miraj

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:27.673
but also he talked of the resurrection time

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:30.257
when your hands will speak.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.882
Two things He said,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.590
first that your hands will speak

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.090
when you will get your realisation .

00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:43.673
It's a very great thing to say

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:48.465
because that is how you can ascertain and you can be sure

00:03:48.757 --> 00:03:51.465
that you got your realisation.

00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:53.757
That's the sign He gave,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.590
and the second thing He talked about Miraj

00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:01.798
and the white horse He said was nothing  but the Kundalini,

00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:07.174
He didn't used the word Kundalini but He said it's a white horse.

00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:13.299
So He is the one who knew what should happen to the

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:15.299
people when they got their self realisation.

00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:19.798
That's the great revelation to all of you

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.798
and of such a help to Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.381
You are all realised souls

00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:30.590
because you can feel the vibrations one thing,

00:04:30.882 --> 00:04:36.882
and secondly how you have become He explained it very clearly.

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:41.299
We have so many saints in India, so many of them,

00:04:41.506 --> 00:04:45.673
one better than the other and whatever they talked,

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:51.007
whatever they say, is so remarkable... is so remarkable.

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:58.506
But actually, human beings, I  think we are very dumb,

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:03.174
that they never realised that we have so many saints here.

00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:08.007
Even in Turkey we had Sufis where it's a Sunni religion,

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:11.299
there too, we had so many Sufis

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.299
all over the world. We had realised souls,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.506
they were not incarnations, but they were born realised souls.

00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:27.715
So you see their explanation and everything is very good  because

00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:31.381
they were human beings and what ever they said

00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:37.215
was very much good for human beings to understand.

00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:39.590
Because an incarnation said something,

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:41.715
it is something from the beyond

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:45.715
and this new,

00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:51.798
I should say, advice of the people who were

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.798
really human beings and had become realised souls and

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:02.215
how they have talked about the various things is very remarkable.

00:06:02.506 --> 00:06:04.923
Firstly most of them were poets

00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:10.590
and this, we had Kabir in India,

00:06:10.923 --> 00:06:12.798
we don't know how he was born,

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:16.007
where he was from, who were his parents,

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:18.299
it's absolutely not known,

00:06:18.506 --> 00:06:24.090
despite that you can only make out from their poetry that

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.007
he was the great great Sahaj Yogi,

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:30.090
and how he have described things very interesting.

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:35.715
He brought forth so many fundamental truths in his poetry

00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:37.798
and he talked about it.

00:06:38.132 --> 00:06:41.007
He didn't belong to any religion, as such,

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:46.132
when he died there was a fight between Hindus and Muslims :

00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:50.631
what should we do with his body.

00:06:50.923 --> 00:06:55.923
And they say when they had lifted the sheet

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:59.798
they found flowers, two types of flower one for Hindus

00:07:00.132 --> 00:07:04.715
and one for Muslims,

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.132
so that's how he have solved the problems

00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:10.299
of this stupid fight people were having.

00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:16.798
In Sahaj Yoga we are not belonging to any such stupid religion,

00:07:17.132 --> 00:07:21.215
we belongs to one religion that is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:24.299
and all the stupidity of all these religions

00:07:24.506 --> 00:07:26.506
we should really throw away

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.923
because, what you just see now today

00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:33.840
every where, every religious group is fighting each other,

00:07:34.132 --> 00:07:37.506
beating each other, finishing each other,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.132
is not the way a religious person should be like that

00:07:43.423 --> 00:07:44.840
but  they are killing each other.

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:48.007
I mean, all kind of  horrible things they are doing,

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:53.132
unbelievable how they can do that, such cruelty.

00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:57.631
And first thing is for a yogi,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.132
or for a saint, cruelty is  absolutely not  there,

00:08:04.423 --> 00:08:08.215
they will sacrifice their lives, they will do any thing,

00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:10.715
but they will not be cruel to any other person.

00:08:11.049 --> 00:08:15.631
Now, those who in the name of God and in the religion are cruel

00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:20.299
are actually not at all by  any chances religious people.

00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:24.715
So this is what the perversion of religion is,

00:08:25.049 --> 00:08:28.548
we all should understand, if we belong to Sahaj Yoga

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.548
then for us kindness, sweetness, compassion and love

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.049
is the main quality we should have

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:42.257
and if  you don't have that, then we are not Sahaj Yogis.

00:08:42.548 --> 00:08:45.631
So we are a different clan,

00:08:45.923 --> 00:08:51.257
I should say, a  different personalities,

00:08:51.548 --> 00:08:52.631
who are really realised souls,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.049
who are above all these nonsensical ideas

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.340
and who have vibrations.

00:09:01.631 --> 00:09:05.631
But, as I said, that now you must spread it

00:09:05.923 --> 00:09:08.049
because I have come on this Earth

00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:11.840
just for people to get their emancipation,

00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:14.132
get their realisation

00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:17.340
and unless and until all the people

00:09:17.548 --> 00:09:23.132
who believe in their emancipation get it, I won't be happy.

00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:24.965
There are many people who do believe

00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:28.757
but not yet got their realisation,

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.965
so you have to work and you will be amazed

00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:35.757
you will find people who are very anxious to get their realisation.

00:09:36.049 --> 00:09:39.965
It will work out on this Guru Purnima day,

00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:41.757
it is a very auspicious day.

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:45.548
I bless you with a special power

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.257
that you can give realisation to other.

00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:51.257
Don't get involved in your own problems,

00:09:51.548 --> 00:09:54.757
that's not important, that will all be solved.

00:09:55.049 --> 00:10:00.049
Mostly what I got letters about is their own personal problems

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.174
or some sort  of other problems.

00:10:02.465 --> 00:10:05.174
What you should do is to see what is your problem within you

00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:10.257
what is happening within you, why we are having a problem within,

00:10:10.673 --> 00:10:16.340
what is our duty, why we have got  our self realisation,

00:10:16.673 --> 00:10:20.548
why we   have got this wealth of spirituality

00:10:20.757 --> 00:10:23.049
and what should we do with it.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.257
I tell you really think about it every day,

00:10:27.548 --> 00:10:31.965
even for half an hour, you will realise that

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:36.882
you are very well equipped people.

00:10:37.174 --> 00:10:41.381
Saints have done so much, they have written so many things

00:10:41.673 --> 00:10:43.882
they have fought the people, they did everything.

00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:45.757
You don't have to do anything like that,

00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:49.174
but one thing is that you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:50.465 --> 00:10:55.673
Even now Sahaj Yoga is not so much accepted everywhere,

00:10:55.965 --> 00:10:57.882
people don't know about it,

00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:01.757
it's surprising while all kinds of horrible gurus

00:11:01.965 --> 00:11:03.049
are very well known.

00:11:03.381 --> 00:11:06.757
So we have to do it by our behaviour,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:13.174
by our understanding, by our whole life, people should say

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:17.090
that these are something rare people and different people.

00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:22.257
I am happy today is another day of Guru Purnima

00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:25.381
which is a very auspicious day

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.590
and to be regarded as a very big blessing for you

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:34.590
because this gives you, I mean this is a certificate,

00:11:34.757 --> 00:11:39.090
that you all are capable of being Gurus.

00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:40.965
You have to become that,

00:11:41.174 --> 00:11:45.381
becoming is important, in Sahaj Yoga becoming is important,

00:11:45.673 --> 00:11:48.590
all other things are really of no use.

00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:52.965
You have to become, specially ladies are shy I think.

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:56.381
They can do a lot and they should work it out,

00:11:56.673 --> 00:12:01.090
they are shy for nothing at all, what is the need to be shy?

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.882
They are very shy ladies and

00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:12.174
they just don't get into the whole working of  Sahaj Yoga,

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.882
You should. If the ladies start talking about it,

00:12:16.174 --> 00:12:18.174
I think it will work much faster.

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:21.965
And I bless you all to do this work,

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:25.381
which was left half done by the Saints,

00:12:25.673 --> 00:12:28.882
it's your duty to complete it .

00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:30.673
May God Bless You.
