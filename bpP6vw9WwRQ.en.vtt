00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:10.587
All our problems, whether in India
or anywhere,

00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:19.494
is because of human beings, because they
have been not enlightened.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:25.291
See, if you are enlightened you’ll have
no problem of any quarrelling

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.939
or any fighting and all that.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.865
If you are enlightened, then you will think
about others,

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:41.278
others as if they are your own, bother
your heads about them.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.015
You will not think about yourself anymore.

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:52.339
If you are enlightened then [there's]
no question of any violence in your head.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.230
Nowadays in the name of religion,
in the name of everything,

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.779
there is so much of violence.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:04.169
This violence can be easily corrected
if they all become Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.629
Think, if all people become Sahaja Yogis,
how will they quarrel, for what?

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.692
So this religion is there, but above
all these religions

00:01:13.893 --> 00:01:18.598
is the religion of Sahaja Yoga, where
you become one.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.494
And there all these quarrels of religions
will disappear.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.080
This is not the only problem we have
as human beings,

00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:30.687
we have some other problems also,
very serious.

00:01:30.888 --> 00:01:38.612
That is, we have a hankering.

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:45.099
We are very greedy. We cannot adjust
yourself to any other circumstances.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.268
We want to live in complete comfort and
this and that.

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:54.949
But after this you can sleep anywhere, you
can eat anywhere, you need not eat.

00:01:55.128 --> 00:02:05.148
You become a person who is above all these
needs, all these demands, absolutely.

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:24.780
Then you don’t worry, you don’t worry.
There’s worry for what?

00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:29.273
Supposing I get lost somewhere and the car
is going in a wrong way:

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:33.837
all right, I have to go that way,
that’s why I’m going like that.

00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:36.789
What is there to feel upset about it?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.974
So many things, small, big, happen in your
life for which you get upset.

00:02:44.175 --> 00:02:48.634
But now, with this blessing of Sahastrara,

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:54.868
you’ll be amazed, there is help
from Paramchaitanya.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.972
And that means a tremendous help, because
it acts globally, it acts individually,

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:11.080
it acts on communities, it acts on nations,

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:20.329
because there is a Divine – what we call
‘Divine’ – where is a Divine play going on.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.911
And this Divine play plays tremendous
beautiful things,

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:30.395
by which people start correcting
themselves.

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:33.944
So, you should never be nervous, you should
never be upset,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:39.239
because you have the Divine Power
within you, and it will correct.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.268
It can correct anyone. I mean, recently
we had a case of one boy

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:51.041
who was hit by a truck and they said
his lungs were smashed.

00:03:51.242 --> 00:03:55.819
Now, with the lungs smashed, nobody has
heard that they become normal.

00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:59.602
Not only they became normal, but he started
breathing normally.

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:05.874
And now he is all right. Is only this work
is done by Paramchaitanya.

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:10.364
You don’t have to do anything. Any problem
comes before you,

00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:17.150
before it really touches you, is solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

00:04:17.912 --> 00:04:24.931
But you must have full faith in yourself
and in Paramachaitanya

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:30.533
and believe that you are a realised-soul.
Nobody can harm you.

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:35.168
If they try to harm you, for the time
being, all right, you may suffer,

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:40.363
but you don’t also feel the sufferings
and you get out of it.

00:04:40.564 --> 00:04:46.965
Such a security, such a proper guidance
is there.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:51.194
Also you are saved from all kinds
of attacks

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:55.840
and all kinds of mistakes that you commit.

00:04:56.041 --> 00:05:03.331
It’s all such a big – I would say,
a Computer of Knowledge.

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:10.387
He knows, It knows what you are doing
and what you should not do,

00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:16.322
where you are going and what should
not be your way.

00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:22.813
He knows, It knows everything, knows
everything about you.

00:05:23.014 --> 00:05:28.358
So then you have to become aware of It.

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:33.003
Now this is the stage where I would say
that you have to be aware

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:40.793
that you are realised-souls, you are
different,

00:05:40.994 --> 00:05:46.472
very unique. You are realised-souls,
you are not ordinary people.

00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:56.450
And that you are protected by this
Paramchaitanya. Nothing can change you,

00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:04.000
nothing can trouble you, nothing can
overpower you.

00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:09.263
Because you are not aware, also, of this
Paramachaitanya,

00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:13.248
that’s why you, a little bit, get worried.
And people write to me,

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.492
“Mother, my - something wrong with
my daughter, something this thing."

00:06:17.693 --> 00:06:23.372
Everything can be corrected
by Paramchaitanya,

00:06:23.573 --> 00:06:27.622
if you know how to leave it to That,

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.575
if you understand how you are one
with that Paramchaitanya,

00:06:33.776 --> 00:06:42.032
you are a part and parcel of that. And that
Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:46.950
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:52.969
there’s no need to have very conscious
effort. Accept life as it is.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.374
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.
Don’t retaliate,

00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:01.158
don’t get angry, don’t get upset.
Just accept.

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:06.215
And you’ll enjoy the same life which
was irritating you!

00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:12.428
You will see the enjoying part of that,
and it will be so beautiful

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:16.985
the way you will see that you’ll get over
all your problems,

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:19.718
you’ll get over all your enemies.

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:27.298
And a kind of a very fresh, beautiful
existence you’ll have.

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:34.620
So now, as you are all Sahaja Yogis,
is a very great position.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:42.260
With that, if you humble down, humble down,
then you’ll be amazed to see

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:49.569
that, you are absolutely in contact with
this Paramchaitanya;

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.396
not only that, but you have become
Paramchaitanya.

00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:01.894
With this Paramchaitanya you can do
anything.

00:08:02.095 --> 00:08:08.410
I need not tell you what you can do,
because some of you may not believe.

00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:14.493
But that’s [what] my own experience is,
that, if you are the Paramchaitanya,

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:19.978
if you know you are the Paramchaitanya,
then it keeps your dignity,

00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:26.389
it keeps your position, it keeps your world
and looks after you.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.731
And whatever is just said or desired,
you just get it.

00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:37.844
Your desires also change. Your desires
are not for stupid things,

00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:42.654
but for something that is very noble.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:49.663
Like, you want to transform people, you
want to do Sahaja Yoga work.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.908
All these desires are fulfilled fully,

00:08:54.109 --> 00:09:00.202
when you want to do it, you like it and
you think of it.

00:09:00.403 --> 00:09:04.338
It is something, even seeing something:

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:09.006
if you see something and you are stunned
by that!

00:09:09.207 --> 00:09:18.042
Immediately Paramchaitanya will take over
and you will have no problems, no problems.

00:09:18.243 --> 00:09:26.488
Because the way we react to all these
difficulties and to so-called odds in life

00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:29.912
becomes a play, just a play.
You are amazed!

00:09:30.113 --> 00:09:34.289
You looked at it and finished!
Look at that, and finished!

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:42.238
That is how it is the light, which goes into
the darkness and finishes the darkness.

00:09:42.439 --> 00:09:47.109
The darkness is finished, and our problems
are finished also.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.862
So this is what is our awareness has
to become.

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:54.693
Awareness has to become Paramachaitanya.

00:09:54.894 --> 00:10:00.074
Then you get all the ideas, everything
that are Divine.

00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:07.767
But not only that, but also the help of
the Divine, all the solutions of the Divine.

00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:12.898
It’s something amazing! And everything
quietens down,

00:10:13.099 --> 00:10:19.407
everything settles down, and you are
amazed, watching all this,

00:10:19.608 --> 00:10:25.436
that you are the centre of doing
all these things.

00:10:25.637 --> 00:10:29.289
You are not aware that you are doing,
and you are this.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.961
That ego part is missing. But you
see it’s all happening around you,

00:10:34.162 --> 00:10:38.814
and then you are amazed how it is
happening.

00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:44.634
The whole lifestyle changes, the whole
understanding changes,

00:10:44.835 --> 00:10:51.318
and you become a great source of happiness,
joy and knowledge to others.

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:57.784
You don’t have to study anything, you don’t
have to know much,

00:10:57.952 --> 00:11:04.113
but you will know about everything,
what is right and what is wrong.

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:11.011
And then only you can tell the things
with complete authority

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:16.545
that, “This is not right!” Like today,
we had a discussion on this point

00:11:16.746 --> 00:11:21.540
about the economic position and
the economics of modern times.

00:11:21.741 --> 00:11:29.367
I said, “Is all wrong, because it is
self-destructive.”

00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:36.042
It destroys the nations, if not your
nation, other nations.

00:11:36.243 --> 00:11:45.347
Then it also destroys your family life.
It destroys your value system.

00:11:45.548 --> 00:11:52.794
It completely destroys you. So what sort
of an economics is this?

00:11:52.995 --> 00:12:03.928
It’s just a show, just a, like a, you can
say, a balloon: it can burst any moment.

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:07.469
I have seen people who are very rich,
very this thing,

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:13.073
think no end of themselves [then] become
bankrupt. And very bankrupt become rich.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:20.013
So it’s [a] kind of a turmoil in which
they are jumping,

00:12:20.214 --> 00:12:26.297
from one shore to another shore. But
you are not. You watch that drama.

00:12:26.498 --> 00:12:32.929
You see all that drama, and with your peace
you can see everything, very calmly.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.330
Not, it’s not difficult for you to create
more people like this.

00:12:37.531 --> 00:12:44.070
It’s not difficult to transform this world.
The time has come, just ripe time.

00:12:44.271 --> 00:12:48.520
Like when the proper time comes,
the blossom time comes,

00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:54.133
so many flowers become fruits. So,
like that, you all have become.

00:12:54.334 --> 00:12:59.569
Now it is for you to create seeds to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.910
You are at that level of awareness now
where Paramchaitanya is with you,

00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:11.073
absolutely part and parcel of you,
absolutely with you to give you

00:13:11.274 --> 00:13:20.234
all necessary help, all necessary prestige,
and also the personality.

00:13:21.947 --> 00:13:23.753
May God bless you all.
