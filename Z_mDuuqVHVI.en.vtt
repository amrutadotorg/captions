00:00:12.973 --> 00:00:19.380
I am immensely joyous to see you all here.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:32.986
I do not know what to say from my side.

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:39.660
The words get lost, they have no meaning.

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:44.220
So many of you are aspiring to ascend

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.973
to that state where you would
have complete joy, bliss and peace.

00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:04.133
This is what I could give you.

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:08.685
And a mother is only happy when she can give

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:11.580
whatever she has to her children.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:18.620
Her unhappiness, all her restlessness,

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:26.573
everything is just to achieve that end

00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:29.733
– to gift all
that she has.

00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:39.100
I don’t know how much to
thank you people to go through all this

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.533
to get to that treasure
that you have within yourself.

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:54.940
‘Sahaj’ is the only word I could think [of]

00:01:55.453 --> 00:02:01.260
when I started to

00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:06.113
manifest Sahastrara opening.

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:15.965
That’s easily understood by everyone so far.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:22.699
But you have realised that it
is today a different style of yoga

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.260
where first enlightenment is given

00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:32.160
and then you are allowed to look
after yourself. It was never done before.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.373
It’s just a venture of
your Mother which has worked out.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.420
Otherwise, in the olden times...

00:02:53.392 --> 00:03:02.033
In the olden times the system of...

00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:23.060
So in the olden times, of course

00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:29.580
the concern of Divine
was to get people enlightened

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:35.093
and It did not know how to work it out.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.540
No incarnation ever tried
to work it out in this fashion.

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:50.420
But whenever they tried, they tried to

00:03:52.066 --> 00:04:00.160
have a very severe hardship for
the seekers – very severe hardships.

00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:06.540
I wonder how many of you have read the treatise
of Buddha,

00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:13.119
when he used to travel with thousand
of his disciples – not giving Realisation.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.420
They were not Realised-souls, without feeling
any joy around;

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.660
with two clothes,

00:04:22.826 --> 00:04:24.963
living in the jungles.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.746
Just two clothes!

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:35.493
And the area where he visited, which I have
seen myself, is terribly cold, chilly, absolutely chilly.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.060
And the clothes were not clothes actually,
it was cloth covering their body.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.660
Sleeping on the open ground

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:55.972
in very severe winter or maybe in summer.

00:04:57.186 --> 00:05:01.012
Without any shoes they were asked to walk,
for miles together, miles together!

00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:05.733
If you go and see where Buddha has walked
and trodden, you will be surprised!

00:05:07.693 --> 00:05:10.800
Buddha was also young – he used to walk.

00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:16.592
But his disciples used to walk much more
because he would go and station in a place.

00:05:16.793 --> 00:05:23.326
He would send his disciples. There was
no time to advertise or to announce anything.

00:05:23.527 --> 00:05:29.393
So he used to stay in one place, and the
disciples used to go around the villages,

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:35.380
ask for bhiksha – meaning the ‘alms’ –

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.492
to gather some food from the villages;
cook one time, give part of it to Buddha.

00:05:43.693 --> 00:05:46.726
And rest of that they used to eat.

00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:53.433
They would go, work out,
get people from all the villages,

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:59.546
whatever was possible and would
bring them to Buddha for sermon.

00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:04.060
Such sacrifices!

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.846
They have lived in huts, caves,
in terrible darkness, meditating.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.923
But they never got Realisation.

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.953
Very few got their Realisation.

00:06:19.363 --> 00:06:26.060
They were people who were sons
of great princes [kings], and princes,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:34.600
dukes, duchesses – all very, very rich people.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.640
Woman of very rich families followed him.

00:06:44.286 --> 00:06:51.940
And they walked for miles together
with him in the thorny routes;

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.700
because they felt that Buddha’s work

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.980
was of such universal importance,

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:07.820
that they are the part and
parcel of such a tremendous task;

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:15.646
that they should be taking part
in such a great work for humanity.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:21.500
This is not only in India, but even Viditama

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:27.163
who started the Zen system in Japan.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:33.393
In China, I was surprised, the amount of
sacrifices the saints had made, the way they lived!

00:07:33.594 --> 00:07:38.280
I mean if you see the way they were living
– in the conditions – you cannot imagine!

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:46.280
And they ended up their
lives like that, working it out.

00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:51.792
Without any proper guidance because
Buddha had died – there was no way out.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.746
They had to find their own ways. Then they
found mahayan and shvetayan – all kind of things.

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:07.160
Even if you see other seekers in other religions –
like at the time of Christ – where did they live?

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:12.900
And after the death of Christ it was even worse
because they were persecuted, they were killed,

00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:17.813
they were tortured, crucified!

00:08:20.813 --> 00:08:23.060
It happened with Moses also

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:29.206
– his disciples were hounded
so they had to all run towards India.

00:08:29.407 --> 00:08:31.573
Imagine the distances!

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.700
From that area to Kashmir – how they must
have walked,

00:08:38.653 --> 00:08:42.033
how they must have lived,
how they must have carried on.

00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:47.573
And in thousands, in
thousands they came, to India.

00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:55.753
Because they realised that
they are doing a tremendous task.

00:08:55.954 --> 00:08:58.920
Something so great that they are supporting.

00:09:00.593 --> 00:09:04.633
In this country we had a struggle of freedom.

00:09:05.332 --> 00:09:10.099
I was part and parcel of that.
My parents were part and parcel of that.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.906
They were rich people, quite rich
I should say, from every standard.

00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:18.852
You will be amazed –
my father burnt all his suits.

00:09:19.053 --> 00:09:21.702
They were stitched in England.

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:24.852
My mother burnt all her saris.

00:09:25.053 --> 00:09:29.060
They used to spin their own clothes and wear them.

00:09:32.522 --> 00:09:38.180
My father sacrificed
everything, every pie that he had,

00:09:38.586 --> 00:09:41.040
for the freedom struggle (1 pie = rupee 1/192).

00:09:41.272 --> 00:09:44.506
He left nothing for us,
not a single [pie], I should say.

00:09:44.707 --> 00:09:48.540
Of course, our family being rich
we had silver and gold and all that

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.439
but as far as all the cash
money was concerned – was spent.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:59.625
And all this silver and gold also, thanks
to English, that they took away from us

00:09:59.826 --> 00:10:02.778
and they returned us when they went back.

00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:06.639
That’s how we had some
silver and gold left in the family.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.111
Every thing, all that is
material, was snatched away.

00:10:10.312 --> 00:10:15.140
And I know. We lived in beautiful houses
and then we shifted to huts and lived there.

00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:18.152
Sacrifices to the maximum.

00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:21.351
And we were very happy about it, very proud!

00:10:21.552 --> 00:10:26.153
We had only two changes (of clothes).
We used to wash our clothes.

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:30.865
We lived like very poor people;

00:10:31.066 --> 00:10:33.900
sleeping on this kind of
thing (thin, rough floor mats).

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:39.613
For my life, I remember

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:43.780
that I never used to take a pillow;

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:47.272
I never used chappals (sandals) for ages.

00:10:47.473 --> 00:10:51.412
I had only one sweater
made of this kind of a material.

00:10:51.613 --> 00:10:57.346
Till I passed out and went to
medical college, I had that sweater with me.

00:10:58.132 --> 00:11:01.986
I had only one coat, throughout my education

00:11:02.413 --> 00:11:06.620
when I was in Lahore which was terribly
cold – sometimes can be like London –

00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:09.560
which was worn out and finished.

00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:16.833
But we never grudged and never grumbled and
never said that our father should have looked after us

00:11:17.034 --> 00:11:20.119
and done something, “Why did he just
sacrifice everything for the country?”

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.546
Never! Never! Never!

00:11:24.393 --> 00:11:29.060
But even today, when they see us anywhere,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.139
they know we are the children of such a great man.

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:36.513
They have tremendous respect for us.

00:11:37.773 --> 00:11:42.646
That quality was created,
I should say by Mahatma Gandhi.

00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:46.740
He made everybody

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:53.500
so transformed into a new personality
of tremendous sacrifice! Tremendous!

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.726
You cannot imagine how people lived!

00:11:58.826 --> 00:12:04.660
All the money we had, everything that
we had, all conveniences and conveyances,

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.720
all housing, everything, was given up –

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.093
not only by my father but so many of them.

00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:19.039
Otherwise we could have not got our freedom.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.386
To get our freedom this
country has sacrificed so much.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.526
Now, after that, we are here to get our freedom,

00:12:32.006 --> 00:12:37.600
to get the freedom for our Spirit.

00:12:38.543 --> 00:12:42.580
To make our Spirit free from our greed, lust;

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:47.618
from your anger, from our conditionings,

00:12:47.819 --> 00:12:50.340
from our terrible ego,

00:12:50.913 --> 00:12:58.366
from the body being enslaved by comforts.

00:13:02.473 --> 00:13:05.932
I must say Gandhiji had a special charm.

00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:08.333
I don’t know how he managed.

00:13:09.252 --> 00:13:14.126
He was like Touch of Midas – he touched
anybody and he became transformed.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.500
And he was an extremely strict
man – very kind to me, to children

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.452
– but he was an extremely strict [man].

00:13:27.853 --> 00:13:31.533
He would not tolerate any nonsense at all!

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:37.940
Throughout, if you study in the way all these
people were brought up,

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:42.673
not only for freedom of independence,

00:13:42.873 --> 00:13:46.380
but even before that, for Spiritual
life, anywhere,

00:13:49.153 --> 00:13:53.380
there’s one thing very common – is sacrifice.

00:13:54.253 --> 00:13:58.140
And the consciousness that
you are doing something great,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.260
consciousness that you are
part and parcel of the whole,

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.500
such a big thing, such a big work,

00:14:07.586 --> 00:14:10.126
such a noble cause!!

00:14:10.786 --> 00:14:17.340
And then there was one thing very common,

00:14:20.773 --> 00:14:23.820
very common among all of them:

00:14:25.213 --> 00:14:28.760
that the noble cause,

00:14:29.993 --> 00:14:37.960
the upliftment (sic) of the noble cause,
made them sacrifice in such a sahaj manner.

00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:43.060
Much more than the Sahaj Yogis sometimes,
who have got so much in Sahaj Yoga.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.772
They have got their joy,
they have got their Spirit.

00:14:45.973 --> 00:14:50.220
[But] I have seen with my own eyes, such people
in this country;

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.160
whom you may call legendary but I have seen it.

00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:58.819
Thousands of people were
killed and butchered, children died.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.653
Nobody shed tears. Nobody shed tears!

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:14.540
But to feel that you are for such a noble
cause

00:15:16.826 --> 00:15:23.900
itself gives you that joy and
that sense of involvement!

00:15:27.733 --> 00:15:34.600
And moreover, what I know about Mahatma Gandhi
and other people, what I have seen, how they were –

00:15:35.413 --> 00:15:38.572
everybody was not allowed to come in.

00:15:39.526 --> 00:15:43.440
And anybody who did slightest thing less,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.340
whether he was king’s son or he
was anybody’s daughter or anything,

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.380
any little thing they spoilt, anything –

00:15:53.146 --> 00:15:55.520
he was chucked out.

00:15:56.026 --> 00:16:01.640
I have stayed in Gandhi’s ashram, so I know what it is,
and that’s why you know I can go through rigorous life.

00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:04.006
It is his training.

00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:11.800
All the children above twelve years had
to clean the whole of that ashram area –

00:16:12.001 --> 00:16:14.926
which is in fifty acres of land –

00:16:16.753 --> 00:16:18.786
every morning.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.566
They had to clean their latrines.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.586
Also the latrines of the guests.
I have cleaned!

00:16:29.692 --> 00:16:33.020
And they were allowed only two dresses.

00:16:34.266 --> 00:16:39.559
And nothing could be kept, even you cannot
see one paper anywhere, any litter anywhere

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.760
– so clean, spick and span.

00:16:47.093 --> 00:16:50.985
And the living places were so neat and tidy.

00:16:51.186 --> 00:16:55.026
It was all done with cow dung,
completely with cow dung.

00:16:55.227 --> 00:17:02.573
Everybody had to take a bath, early in
the morning at 4 o’ clock, with cold water.

00:17:03.593 --> 00:17:06.073
Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru

00:17:06.273 --> 00:17:11.419
or Abdul Kalam Azad, my
father, of any age group, or a child.

00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:18.839
And 5 o’clock, Mahatma
Gandhi was there for his lecture.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.693
Please don’t raise your hands or raise your
Kundalinis! Please be seated! That’s not the way!

00:17:23.933 --> 00:17:26.406
Try to understand what I am talking!

00:17:30.326 --> 00:17:37.725
And then, early in the morning at 4 o’clock,

00:17:37.926 --> 00:17:43.286
you will be surprised,
getting up. For me it was alright!

00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:52.746
And then to walk in that fifty
acres of land to centre of that hall,

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:56.340
which was nothing but just
an open space surrounded by

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.122
some sort of huts where Gandhiji was living.

00:17:59.323 --> 00:18:06.093
To walk all the way after bath, after getting
ready and all that. And snakes used to crawl along.

00:18:06.573 --> 00:18:08.738
Nobody was bitten, of course.

00:18:08.939 --> 00:18:11.300
I think the snakes understood that

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:17.406
people were busy with the great
job of freeing this great country!

00:18:22.233 --> 00:18:27.302
And we would sit just like this 
and the snakes would be crawling.

00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:31.413
No lights were allowed. No lights of any kind.

00:18:34.199 --> 00:18:36.999
We only used sunlight.

00:18:38.533 --> 00:18:43.259
And when Gandhiji would come – I mean 
sunlight was not there in the morning, at all

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:50.506
– some lanterns were brought to put there.
And we would see the snakes crawling up.

00:18:53.693 --> 00:18:58.100
But I never heard anybody
complaining. But like a war,

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.100
drove with such passion,

00:19:06.026 --> 00:19:10.465
everybody, competing as to, 
“What I can do? How I can be alright?”

00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:13.419
Nobody even thought of comfort!

00:19:18.746 --> 00:19:26.673
Of course they were all up to 50 years 
of age or something like that, maybe.

00:19:28.933 --> 00:19:33.933
In the ashram mostly people were up 
to fifty years of age – [at] that time.

00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:46.420
And I have seen by my own eyes the 
people who had huge cars in the house

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.439
and things like that, they sold
[them] off, they threw it away.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.140
They used to come by train to
Wardha station and walk down.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.612
Gandhiji would not see anybody
coming even in tonga (horse-cart).

00:19:58.813 --> 00:20:01.620
And they listened to him and obeyed him.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:11.420
I have seen many missionaries, 
though they are not up to point,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.860
nothing very noble, but that’s
how they take people to task

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.092
and people work it out for them. I have 
seen them. In India we had missionaries,

00:20:19.293 --> 00:20:24.925
and younger people who came from abroad,

00:20:25.126 --> 00:20:30.720
they just absolutely obediently 
listened to the missionaries

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:35.840
and did whatever they said.

00:20:37.293 --> 00:20:42.680
Now today we are doing, as you 
know, the greatest of greatest work!

00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:46.620
Because freedom, independence 
of freedom, or freedom.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.773
Is of course necessary, political
freedom, to talk about the God.

00:20:51.106 --> 00:20:55.693
We could not even make a small, little needle!
At that time we were not allowed by government.

00:20:55.893 --> 00:20:59.653
So much oppressed. So we 
had to get out of the shackles of

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.813
slavery. No doubt.

00:21:04.593 --> 00:21:17.403
But now I find we have another kind of slavery
– a slavery of selfishness, self oriented.

00:21:17.403 --> 00:21:19.673
“This is my comfort.

00:21:19.673 --> 00:21:25.613
I must have this, it should be enjoyable,
I am enjoying, I am this, I am that."

00:21:25.613 --> 00:21:27.713
You should enjoy otherwise it is not something
great.

00:21:27.713 --> 00:21:37.283
I mean the whole thing should provide you
some sort of a feeling instead of you providing

00:21:37.283 --> 00:21:38.673
the feeling.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:47.503
Because people, I think, do not know what
they are doing, what sort of a work they are

00:21:47.503 --> 00:21:48.503
doing.

00:21:48.503 --> 00:21:53.695
They do not want to come to that level of
that height to see what are you up to.

00:21:53.695 --> 00:21:59.803
You are trying to save the whole world!

00:21:59.803 --> 00:22:06.003
This is one of the reasons Sahaj Yoga moves
so slowly, because I see people who are worried

00:22:06.003 --> 00:22:11.303
about their comforts, this, that, and also
themselves are so lousy!

00:22:11.303 --> 00:22:20.623
There’s no smartness about them, no feeling
of that greatness that they have to do.

00:22:20.623 --> 00:22:21.623
You have to be smart.

00:22:21.623 --> 00:22:31.063
If you know you are on war – how you behave?

00:22:31.063 --> 00:22:36.073
I am sure the mediocrity is much less now,
better people.

00:22:36.073 --> 00:22:40.443
I am sure we will get even better people now,
much better people!

00:22:40.443 --> 00:22:45.773
They worry about little, little things: of
their family, this, that.

00:22:45.773 --> 00:22:51.573
They worry about their own problems, and their
jobs, and this and that.

00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:53.883
I mean nobody could talk like this to Gandhiji!

00:22:53.883 --> 00:22:57.853
I tell you, he would have slapped you!

00:22:57.853 --> 00:23:01.303
Take it from me.

00:23:01.303 --> 00:23:07.503
It is as if to come to Sahaj Yoga means – solve
your problems – that’s all.

00:23:07.503 --> 00:23:12.843
Though they are solved, no doubt, you are
helped, God helps you so much.

00:23:12.843 --> 00:23:15.663
But how much are you doing about it?

00:23:15.663 --> 00:23:27.143
Of course we have some very great Sahaj yogis,
I would not deny that fact, we have some – much

00:23:27.143 --> 00:23:31.623
more than I had, ever – and that’s why
I am very joyous about it.

00:23:31.623 --> 00:23:39.093
But the dedication we have: we count every
penny that we spend, how much we have got

00:23:39.093 --> 00:23:42.423
out of that penny, what did we do about it.

00:23:42.423 --> 00:23:48.433
This is not
the way!

00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:50.394
Buddha never spent a single penny of his own.

00:23:50.394 --> 00:23:52.323
He got money from all his disciples.

00:23:52.323 --> 00:23:54.553
Built all these big things and all that.

00:23:54.553 --> 00:24:01.873
He never had even a public help from anybody
else.

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:03.113
So rise now!

00:24:03.113 --> 00:24:06.713
You must rise above your petty small mind.

00:24:06.713 --> 00:24:14.173
Rise up to the point where you should know
[that] you are going to save the whole humanity.

00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:20.883
If you cannot feel that, it’s better to
leave Sahaj Yoga.

00:24:20.883 --> 00:24:25.853
Sahaj Yoga is not meant for the people who
are lousy.

00:24:25.853 --> 00:24:27.923
In Marathi the word is ‘gabale’.

00:24:27.923 --> 00:24:37.933
Tukaram has said, “yerya gabalyache kaama
nohe” (meaning) “It is not the work of

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:39.873
the lousy!”

00:24:39.873 --> 00:24:50.213
Shivaji himself, when he fought his war, he
caught hold of people, the sartaras and the

00:24:50.213 --> 00:24:52.413
dukes of that time they were.

00:24:52.413 --> 00:24:57.753
They gave up everything they had, they gave
up their lives, every thing!

00:24:57.753 --> 00:25:02.064
Their children they sacrificed, they sacrificed
whatever they had!

00:25:02.064 --> 00:25:07.753
Shivaji had no money to pay them.

00:25:07.753 --> 00:25:12.923
You must have heard lots of stories about
Shivaji.

00:25:12.923 --> 00:25:19.613
While if you see how we Sahaj yogis are in
this world: kshema (well-being) comes before

00:25:19.613 --> 00:25:20.613
yoga.

00:25:20.613 --> 00:25:22.483
Its like that.

00:25:22.483 --> 00:25:25.313
Its your mother’s love.

00:25:25.313 --> 00:25:28.093
I want my children to be comfortable.

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:29.093
They are newly born babes.

00:25:29.093 --> 00:25:37.453
Alright, they need comfort, they are to be
looked after.

00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:47.553
But I cannot blackmail the Divine because
the children are small can I!

00:25:47.553 --> 00:25:53.803
I am here to do the job of God Almighty.

00:25:53.803 --> 00:26:03.333
And when you are my children his grace will
work, He’ll look after you, He’ll make

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:04.543
you grow.

00:26:04.543 --> 00:26:06.353
But grow now!

00:26:06.353 --> 00:26:07.353
Grow!

00:26:07.353 --> 00:26:08.353
You have to grow!

00:26:08.353 --> 00:26:12.293
Get out of this small nonsense that you are!

00:26:12.293 --> 00:26:15.473
See your personality – how do you live?

00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:18.133
Where is your attention?

00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:19.523
What do you think?

00:26:19.523 --> 00:26:24.953
Are you thinking about Sahaj Yoga, that it
is the most important thing for which you

00:26:24.953 --> 00:26:28.793
are chosen?

00:26:28.793 --> 00:26:42.173
I feel sometimes, as I was feeling all the
time, that you might be uncomfortable in many

00:26:42.173 --> 00:26:43.173
places.

00:26:43.173 --> 00:26:48.333
But I myself have seen the way you people
have been in those places, most carelessly

00:26:48.333 --> 00:26:51.873
– the Western Sahaj yogis, I was surprised.

00:26:51.873 --> 00:26:56.123
That way Indians are better in this respect.

00:26:56.123 --> 00:27:00.883
And some of the Indian Sahaj yogis have been
misbehaving in a very funny manner.

00:27:00.883 --> 00:27:01.883
It shocked me!

00:27:01.883 --> 00:27:07.573
The way they have been behaving, shouting
at people, creating problems.

00:27:07.573 --> 00:27:12.953
Some people come to see me, they talk to them
in such a rude manner that they run away.

00:27:12.953 --> 00:27:15.573
You can talk to them sweetly.

00:27:15.573 --> 00:27:18.423
You have to be nice to them; not to shout
at people.

00:27:18.423 --> 00:27:23.363
Alright, I cannot meet everyone at every time,
at every convenience, but that does not mean

00:27:23.363 --> 00:27:28.423
that you have right to shout at others.

00:27:28.423 --> 00:27:37.943
This is so petty and so low that I don’t
know how far I have to come down!

00:27:37.943 --> 00:27:47.933
When you rise above all these petty things,
you will develop that Divine discretion.

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:51.673
That Divine discretion is the real blessing
of God.

00:27:51.673 --> 00:27:57.523
All other blessings, that you think is a blessing,
is no blessing at all!

00:27:57.523 --> 00:28:01.873
Unless and until you can grow, what is the
blessing?

00:28:01.873 --> 00:28:06.353
Like a tree which says, “Oh, such a blessing
that I have got rain!”

00:28:06.353 --> 00:28:12.733
But out of that rain if you cannot grow, what’s
the use of having that rain on you?

00:28:12.733 --> 00:28:28.743
You have to be compassionate, beautiful, sensible
people, who are the highest beings on this earth.

00:28:28.743 --> 00:28:35.563
Take out your attention from all nonsense
that you have been busy with.

00:28:35.563 --> 00:28:42.713
That’s how you get possessed, that’s how
you get conditioned.

00:28:42.713 --> 00:28:46.943
Small, small things you see.

00:28:46.943 --> 00:28:52.123
In India we have another problem: We cannot
tolerate another person.

00:28:52.123 --> 00:28:56.373
If any person is doing good for Sahaj Yoga,
immediately a group is built up (against them)

00:28:56.373 --> 00:28:57.883
– it’s very common with Indians also.

00:28:57.883 --> 00:29:04.103
A group is built up to put him down.

00:29:04.103 --> 00:29:09.513
This was not done when Gandhiji was there.

00:29:09.513 --> 00:29:12.703
I do not know how it happens.

00:29:12.703 --> 00:29:15.903
It only happens with poor leadership.

00:29:15.903 --> 00:29:18.963
I think I don’t have that leadership!

00:29:18.963 --> 00:29:23.863
At the time of Gandhiji he used to blast people
out completely!

00:29:23.863 --> 00:29:32.053
Cutting each other’s throats and saying
things behind the back, forming groups.

00:29:32.053 --> 00:29:37.263
Anybody who works out something nice, and
I try to help that person to express himself,

00:29:37.263 --> 00:29:44.193
immediately a group comes up to press him.

00:29:44.193 --> 00:29:48.343
And there are some hopelessly peripheral,
useless Sahaj Yogis in the West and in the

00:29:48.343 --> 00:29:53.523
East, who try to make a mess of things.

00:29:53.523 --> 00:29:57.333
They think, they are big gurus, big people!

00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.933
Very small people.

00:29:58.933 --> 00:30:01.513
Chicken hearted, I should say.

00:30:01.513 --> 00:30:07.353
And they think they are very big, great people,
because they can take good photographs, maybe,

00:30:07.353 --> 00:30:11.613
or that they can wear a dress in a particular
manner, or something like that – stupid

00:30:11.613 --> 00:30:14.053
stuff as they are!

00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:18.523
And trying to dominate others.

00:30:18.523 --> 00:30:22.353
Such people will be thrown out, absolutely.

00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:28.483
No use having useless people in a machine
like this.

00:30:28.483 --> 00:30:38.163
Today is the beginning of a new era – of
a new era of people of very high qualities

00:30:38.163 --> 00:30:43.103
whose Spirit has been enlightened.

00:30:43.103 --> 00:30:49.033
Let us all think about it!

00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:57.363
Now you have to rule yourself, and you have
to rule others through compassion, love and

00:30:57.363 --> 00:30:58.363
discretion!!

00:30:58.363 --> 00:31:04.923
Today that’s the big time that I have declared
that it is the Universal Religion, the Nirmala

00:31:04.923 --> 00:31:12.383
Religion which is formed out of my teachings
of love.

00:31:12.383 --> 00:31:16.623
But it doesn’t mean by any chance that you
remain dwarfs!

00:31:16.623 --> 00:31:22.823
I’m not going to spoil you!

00:31:22.823 --> 00:31:29.173
I am not going to spoil you by keeping you
dwarfy people!

00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:34.013
So try to rise!

00:31:34.013 --> 00:31:35.853
Do not dominate others.

00:31:35.853 --> 00:31:36.943
Respect!

00:31:36.943 --> 00:31:39.763
Respect each other!

00:31:39.763 --> 00:31:46.283
You are out for a very big work of Viraat.

00:31:46.283 --> 00:31:54.113
How much you know about the Divine nobody
has known so far!

00:31:54.113 --> 00:31:55.913
But fix up yourself.

00:31:55.913 --> 00:32:04.633
I have known a very great saint called Gagangadh
Maharaj who has fallen down completely!

00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:09.703
If a person like him can fall down you also
can fall down if you do not understand what

00:32:09.703 --> 00:32:17.733
is your worth, what is your value and what
is your position you are given.

00:32:17.733 --> 00:32:25.514
So we have to, today, with all our love for
our Mother, have to decide in our heart, that

00:32:25.514 --> 00:32:27.673
we are going to have large heartedness, of
sacrifices!

00:32:27.673 --> 00:32:31.203
What have we sacrificed so far?

00:32:31.203 --> 00:32:32.683
Just think of it.

00:32:32.683 --> 00:32:33.683
Have we?

00:32:33.683 --> 00:32:45.133
Did we sacrifice anything?

00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:57.373
Please try to understand that I have to use
you, the great souls, to save the humanity.

00:32:57.373 --> 00:32:59.373
You must grow.
You must grow.

00:32:59.373 --> 00:33:00.373
You have to grow.

00:33:00.373 --> 00:33:05.403
On money points also people are wretched.

00:33:05.403 --> 00:33:08.043
They make money.

00:33:08.043 --> 00:33:11.143
They save money.

00:33:11.143 --> 00:33:19.933
In America, I was surprised, the way people
cheated me of money!

00:33:19.933 --> 00:33:21.173
Thousands!

00:33:21.173 --> 00:33:28.663
In India also this is a very common practice!

00:33:28.663 --> 00:33:38.593
Then if you have career mindedness, and you
are very ambitious, “How my job will remain?”

00:33:38.593 --> 00:33:45.513
this, that – you better get out of Sahaj
Yoga!

00:33:45.513 --> 00:33:52.873
It’s not going to help us at all!

00:33:52.873 --> 00:33:59.203
Thirdly there are people who believe that,
“This is my wife, this is my beloved, this

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.773
is this,” and all that nonsense.

00:34:00.773 --> 00:34:02.353
Why are you here?

00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:03.843
For what?

00:34:03.843 --> 00:34:13.493
Or “My children, my household, my mother,
my father."

00:34:13.493 --> 00:34:17.213
all sorts of wretched people around!

00:34:17.213 --> 00:34:24.633
If you cannot rise above that, you cannot
help me, I am sorry.

00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:27.133
You cannot help me.

00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:32.643
You have to be very, very strong people.

00:34:32.643 --> 00:34:42.743
You have to be people of very great valour
and great idealism and noble ideas.

00:34:42.743 --> 00:34:55.543
Some are like petty shopkeepers who follow
the platoons to sell some things around – in

00:34:55.543 --> 00:35:01.963
Marathi it is called ‘bazar bhunge’!

00:35:01.963 --> 00:35:17.863
So now you meditate on this point that here we
are to establish the Universal Religion of ascent.

00:35:17.863 --> 00:35:21.103
It is a tremendous task!

00:35:21.103 --> 00:35:31.147
If I could do it alone I would have done it
but I cannot.

00:35:31.147 --> 00:35:34.963
It’s only through you I have to do it.

00:35:34.963 --> 00:35:35.963
And you have a heritage.

00:35:35.963 --> 00:35:50.893
You come from a very great birth, where you
have this heritage.

00:35:50.893 --> 00:36:00.383
With that heritage, if I cannot manage you,
I think I better give up your leadership.

00:36:00.383 --> 00:36:03.643
I cannot do it!

00:36:03.643 --> 00:36:14.043
When we were fighting for our freedom all
of us were removed from schools because we

00:36:14.043 --> 00:36:19.963
were in the missionary school and the missionaries
believed that Christ was born in England!

00:36:19.963 --> 00:36:21.893
So they would not allow us to study in those
schools.

00:36:21.893 --> 00:36:23.733
So we were all removed from those schools.

00:36:23.733 --> 00:36:25.843
We had no education for some time.

00:36:25.843 --> 00:36:29.333
I couldn’t pass my inter-science for two
years.

00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:35.713
I couldn’t appear because they rusticated
us from colleges and schools.

00:36:35.713 --> 00:36:42.613
The government rusticated us.

00:36:42.613 --> 00:36:47.073
But we were such proud children, very proud.

00:36:47.073 --> 00:36:50.263
I was of course very much thick in it.

00:36:50.263 --> 00:36:51.263
I was never frightened.

00:36:51.263 --> 00:36:52.903
I was just an eighteen year old girl.

00:36:52.903 --> 00:37:02.123
And I remember one day some people came and
told us that your father is transferred from

00:37:02.123 --> 00:37:04.823
this jail to another jail.

00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:09.903
They had such pride for all of us, all the
people! So they had brought cars to take us down.

00:37:09.903 --> 00:37:16.052
And they were so many there.

00:37:16.052 --> 00:37:19.723
And [my] mother naturally was worried because
I was a young girl.

00:37:19.723 --> 00:37:25.433
The police used to torture me, used to give
me [electric] shocks, and make my life very

00:37:25.433 --> 00:37:27.543
miserable, beat me, and all that.

00:37:27.543 --> 00:37:34.313
So she was crying and she told an old gentleman
who was there that, “I am worried about

00:37:34.313 --> 00:37:35.313
my daughter.

00:37:35.313 --> 00:37:40.302
I do not want her to be tortured anymore."

00:37:40.302 --> 00:37:46.993
So I went and smiled at him, so he said, “No,
you stop it now!

00:37:46.993 --> 00:37:50.753
You just don’t do it.
It’s not proper."

00:37:50.753 --> 00:37:56.563
So my father took me aside, he said, “Don’t
listen to this ‘old johnny’!

00:37:56.563 --> 00:37:59.533
He’s now about to die.

00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:02.073
Forget him.

00:38:02.073 --> 00:38:09.813
I would like all my children to be sacrificed
on the altar of freedom.

00:38:09.813 --> 00:38:12.773
If you are doing it I am a proud father.

00:38:12.773 --> 00:38:16.093
And I will tell your mother to behave herself.

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:25.213
I am so proud of you!”

00:38:25.213 --> 00:38:28.555
Such atmosphere I have passed through.

00:38:28.555 --> 00:38:32.302
I had to give up my college.

00:38:32.302 --> 00:38:34.963
I was absconding for eight months.

00:38:34.963 --> 00:38:38.323
The police was after my life.

00:38:38.323 --> 00:38:39.653
I know what we have gone through.

00:38:39.653 --> 00:38:42.623
We were very young people -eighteen years.

00:38:42.623 --> 00:38:45.063
You can imagine!

00:38:45.063 --> 00:38:57.103
And now when you have got the freedom of your
Spirit you must seek the comfort of your Spirit.

00:38:57.103 --> 00:39:01.323
There are some people who are complainers,
and this and that -nonsense.

00:39:01.323 --> 00:39:02.853
They should not have come!

00:39:02.853 --> 00:39:08.883
Or those who are Indians – they should get
out of Sahaj Yoga and leave us alone.

00:39:08.883 --> 00:39:16.773
But, those who know that they have come here,
not to enjoy themselves only, but to make

00:39:16.773 --> 00:39:21.613
the whole world enjoy what you have got, to
give it to them.

00:39:21.613 --> 00:39:31.183
And for that one has to sacrifice, one has
to bear the pangs!

00:39:31.183 --> 00:39:38.173
How much I bear your pangs when you are caught
up, when you have troubles, when this and that.

00:39:38.173 --> 00:39:39.563
I have got blisters sometimes, from you, everything.

00:39:39.563 --> 00:39:48.983
But I don’t mind because it is my life,
my mission, my existence, my everything- is

00:39:48.983 --> 00:39:52.903
for the purpose of emancipation of humanity.

00:39:52.903 --> 00:39:57.393
Even the last drop of my blood is for that.

00:39:57.393 --> 00:40:01.073
So my satisfactions are very different.

00:40:01.073 --> 00:40:10.143
Please remember, you are born of a very brave
Mother.

00:40:10.143 --> 00:40:12.463
Please, try to rise!

00:40:12.463 --> 00:40:19.163
Be proud that you are doing such a tremendous
task.

00:40:19.163 --> 00:40:27.493
Have that feeling of great valour.

00:40:27.493 --> 00:40:33.423
Then only, then only, we can achieve results!

00:40:33.423 --> 00:40:38.013
You have seen so many wars, you have seen
so many war pictures, you have seen how people

00:40:38.013 --> 00:40:41.603
have fought, how they have sacrificed themselves.

00:40:41.603 --> 00:40:53.233
And let us see what are we doing in this war!

00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:56.903
Just make your body your slave.

00:40:56.903 --> 00:41:08.943
Get out of the slavery of your body, of your
conditionings, and your nonsensical ego.

00:41:08.943 --> 00:41:15.013
I am sure as a Mother I am not so bad.

00:41:15.013 --> 00:41:22.703
But as a father I think I lack some things.

00:41:22.703 --> 00:41:35.653
Please try to come up so that I should feel
that I did not lack in my fatherly attitude

00:41:35.653 --> 00:41:44.973
towards you – that awe, that understanding
of a father’s expectations.

00:41:44.973 --> 00:41:55.313
This I am not saying to you because it is
some present situation, because a few people

00:41:55.313 --> 00:42:02.733
particularly, or for anything which is very,
very sort of [a] present day problem.

00:42:02.733 --> 00:42:04.923
None of these things.

00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:15.633
But is my announcement of this new dimension
into which we have to rise.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:21.042
And as in the war, we have to declare, “Now
forward on!”

00:42:21.042 --> 00:42:23.613
In the same way this is a declaration.

00:42:23.613 --> 00:42:29.763
In no way to degrade you, in no way to insult
you, or to say anything about anyone of you.

00:42:29.763 --> 00:42:39.753
But to just infuse that inspiration which
led thousands and thousands and millions and

00:42:39.753 --> 00:42:47.163
billions of people to sacrifice for a greater
cause!

00:42:47.163 --> 00:42:52.873
So now have respect for yourself.

00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:53.873
Raise your heads!

00:42:53.873 --> 00:42:58.383
You are the ones who are going to fight.

00:42:58.383 --> 00:43:02.093
You are the ones who are responsible.

00:43:02.093 --> 00:43:03.613
Prepare yourself!

00:43:03.613 --> 00:43:05.783
Prepare your body.

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:09.893
Prepare your mind!

00:43:09.893 --> 00:43:12.643
Be discreet!

00:43:12.643 --> 00:43:20.763
This is my, I would not say ‘request’
again.

00:43:20.763 --> 00:43:22.903
This is my order!

00:43:22.903 --> 00:43:28.733
May God bless you!

00:43:28.733 --> 00:43:36.012
Let us all meditate now!

00:43:36.012 --> 00:43:39.303
There is no need for tying up your Kundalinis.

00:43:39.303 --> 00:43:40.943
There is no need to give yourself bandhan.

00:43:40.943 --> 00:43:45.443
There is no need at all to do anything.

00:43:45.443 --> 00:43:48.193
If you come up to that stage just now.

00:43:48.193 --> 00:43:51.433
There’s no need to raise your hands and
tying up your Kundalini – not necessary.

00:43:51.433 --> 00:43:55.583
Nothing is to be done!

00:43:55.583 --> 00:44:01.263
Your Kundalinis are already tied up.

00:44:01.263 --> 00:44:02.323
Assume!

00:44:02.323 --> 00:44:04.523
Assume that situation, that’s all!

00:44:04.523 --> 00:44:26.493
That’s what you are – the veeras and not
the stupid!

00:44:26.493 --> 00:44:27.493
Respect yourself.

00:44:27.493 --> 00:44:28.493
Respect!

00:44:28.493 --> 00:44:29.743
May God bless you all.

00:44:29.743 --> 00:44:38.943
There’s nothing, nothing more important
to me than to see you rise to that level of

00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:42.983
understanding of your own values and worth
and discretion.

00:44:42.983 --> 00:44:55.823
You have to become sweet, nice people but
very, very powerful!

00:44:55.823 --> 00:44:59.433
That you can control yourself, your tongues
and your things.

00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:06.052
The control, complete control of your self.

00:45:06.052 --> 00:45:14.293
May God bless you again!

00:45:14.293 --> 00:45:16.373
Please meditate.

00:45:16.373 --> 00:45:19.493
Close your eyes!

00:45:19.493 --> 00:45:22.603
Close your eyes!

00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:26.763
Just close your eyes.

00:45:26.763 --> 00:45:34.033
Put your both the hands towards me.

00:45:34.033 --> 00:45:38.023
Put your attention onto Sahastrara!

00:45:38.023 --> 00:45:39.593
Just your attention onto Sahastrara.

00:45:39.593 --> 00:45:42.713
You are in my Sahastrara all of you just now.

00:45:42.713 --> 00:45:45.033
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.

00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:47.983
There’s no thought, nothing.

00:45:47.983 --> 00:45:58.993
Just put your attention to your…and just
rise up to that point.

00:45:58.993 --> 00:46:04.933
There’s no drama about it.

00:46:04.933 --> 00:46:08.493
There’s nothing artificial.

00:46:08.493 --> 00:46:10.873
It’s actualisation.

00:46:10.873 --> 00:46:14.753
All weaknesses are to be left behind.

00:46:14.753 --> 00:46:47.033
Let’s be strong people of strong values
with dignity and sobriety.

00:50:47.033 --> 00:50:50.353
Silence, absolute inner silence.

00:50:50.353 --> 00:50:53.073
And one need not talk too much.

00:50:53.073 --> 00:51:03.033
Too much to jabber, to talk, frivolously,
is not your way.

00:51:03.042 --> 00:51:33.763
Feel it in your heart, your own dignity, your
own glory, the serenity of behaviour.

00:51:45.433 --> 00:51:54.833
You are all saints, but saints of very high
quality, of very high quality.

00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:55.833
Not ordinary type.

00:53:44.533 --> 00:53:46.033
Put your attention to Sahastrara.

00:53:46.033 --> 00:53:48.853
Chitta aple Sahastrara tevaitze.

00:53:48.853 --> 00:53:56.333
Apne Sahastrar pe apna Chitta tev. (Marathi: Put your attention to your Sahastrara)

00:54:56.433 --> 00:55:01.513
Any thought coming say, “Not this, not this,
not this."

00:55:18.433 --> 00:55:20.433
May God bless you.

00:55:41.433 --> 00:55:48.913
I would like to see all the groups some time,
one by one, all the leaders and also certain

00:55:48.913 --> 00:55:54.093
individuals who want to see me.

00:55:54.093 --> 00:56:12.433
We are going to have marriages, and everything,
performed here and it’s going to work out very well.

00:56:12.933 --> 00:56:16.293
But suddenly don’t jump onto the thing!

00:56:16.933 --> 00:56:28.313
Do it in your sobriety, in understanding that,
this marriage is nothing but because you have

00:56:28.313 --> 00:56:38.653
to have children of very high quality. Secondly it has to be auspicious.

00:56:40.433 --> 00:56:45.173
Just to wash off if there was any inauspiciousness.

00:56:56.733 --> 00:57:10.853
I hope you will enjoy your heights now, you
will enjoy you glory and you will enjoy your noble work.

00:57:10.853 --> 00:57:12.733
May God bless you.
