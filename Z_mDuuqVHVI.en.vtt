WEBVTT

00:12.973 --> 00:23.133
I am immensely joyous to see you all here.

00:23.133 --> 00:34.793
I do not know what to say from my side.

00:34.793 --> 00:40.093
The words get lost, they have no meaning.

00:40.093 --> 00:56.103
So many of you are aspiring to ascend to that
state where you would have complete joy, bliss

00:56.103 --> 01:00.512
and peace.

01:00.512 --> 01:04.993
This is what I could give you.

01:04.993 --> 01:12.433
And a mother is only happy when she can give
whatever she has to her children.

01:12.433 --> 01:27.573
Her unhappiness, all her restlessness, everything
is just to achieve that end – to gift all

01:27.573 --> 01:32.243
that she has.

01:32.243 --> 01:43.443
I don’t know how much to thank you people
to go through all this to get to that treasure

01:43.443 --> 01:49.723
that you have within yourself.

01:49.723 --> 02:05.533
‘Sahaj’ is the only word I could think
[of] when I started to manifest Sahastrara

02:05.533 --> 02:08.023
opening.

02:08.023 --> 02:15.442
That’s easily understood by everyone so
far.

02:15.442 --> 02:25.043
But you have realised that it is today a different
style of yoga where first enlightenment is

02:25.043 --> 02:29.642
given and then you are allowed to look after
yourself.

02:29.642 --> 02:32.562
It was never done before.

02:32.562 --> 03:10.663
It’s just a venture of your Mother which
has worked out.

03:10.663 --> 03:31.512
Otherwise, in the olden times the concern
of Divine was to get people enlightened and

03:31.512 --> 03:36.702
It did not know how to work it out.

03:36.702 --> 03:44.633
No incarnation ever tried to work it out in
this fashion.

03:44.633 --> 03:58.752
But whenever they tried, they tried to have
a very severe hardship for the seekers – very

03:58.752 --> 04:00.342
severe hardships.

04:00.342 --> 04:09.163
I wonder how many of you have read the treatise
of Buddha, when he used to travel with thousand

04:09.163 --> 04:12.352
of his disciples – not giving Realisation.

04:12.352 --> 04:23.532
They were not Realised-souls, without feeling
any joy around; with two clothes, living in

04:23.532 --> 04:24.963
the jungles.

04:24.963 --> 04:29.133
Just two clothes!

04:29.133 --> 04:35.353
And the area where he visited, which I have
seen myself, is terribly cold, chilly, absolutely

04:35.353 --> 04:36.353
chilly.

04:36.353 --> 04:43.923
And the clothes were not clothes actually,
it was cloth covering their body.

04:43.923 --> 04:56.173
Sleeping on the open ground in very severe
winter or maybe in summer.

04:56.173 --> 05:00.553
Without any shoes they were asked to walk,
for miles together, miles together!

05:00.553 --> 05:06.243
If you go and see where Buddha has walked
and trodden, you will be surprised!

05:06.243 --> 05:11.153
Buddha was also young – he used to walk.

05:11.153 --> 05:16.793
But his disciples used to walk much more because
he would go and station at one place.

05:16.793 --> 05:18.363
He would send his disciples.

05:18.363 --> 05:24.213
There was no time to advertise or to announce
anything.

05:24.213 --> 05:31.123
So he used to stay in one place, and the disciples
used to go around the villages, ask for bhiksha

05:31.123 --> 05:40.803
– meaning the ‘alms’ – to gather some
food from the villages; cook one time, give

05:40.803 --> 05:42.743
part of it to Buddha.

05:42.743 --> 05:50.973
And rest of that they used to eat.

05:50.973 --> 05:56.003
They would go, work out, get people from all
the villages, whatever was possible and would

05:56.003 --> 05:59.853
bring them to Buddha for sermon.

05:59.853 --> 06:01.623
Such sacrifices!

06:01.623 --> 06:10.493
They have lived in huts, caves, in terrible
darkness, meditating.

06:10.493 --> 06:14.923
But they never got Realisation.

06:14.923 --> 06:19.363
Very few got their Realisation.

06:19.363 --> 06:31.793
They were people who were sons of great kings,
and princes, dukes, duchesses – all very,

06:31.793 --> 06:35.763
very rich people.

06:35.763 --> 06:43.933
Woman of very rich families followed him.

06:43.933 --> 06:55.073
And they walked for miles together with him
in the thorny routes; because they felt that

06:55.073 --> 07:05.793
Buddha’s work was of such universal importance,
that they are the part and parcel of such

07:05.793 --> 07:16.833
a tremendous task; that they should be taking
part in such a great work for humanity.

07:16.833 --> 07:27.563
This is not only in India, but even Viditama
who started the Zen system in Japan.

07:27.563 --> 07:33.333
In China, I was surprised, the amount of sacrifices
the saints had made, the way they lived!

07:33.333 --> 07:37.993
I mean if you see the way they were living
– in the conditions – you cannot imagine!

07:37.993 --> 07:46.673
And they ended up their lives like that, working
it out.

07:46.673 --> 07:51.013
Without any proper guidance because Buddha
had died – there was no way out.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.153
They had to find their own ways.

07:53.153 --> 08:00.143
Then they found mahayan and shvetayan – all
kind of things.

08:00.143 --> 08:05.663
Even if you see other seekers in other religions
– like at the time of Christ – where did

08:05.663 --> 08:07.653
they live?

08:07.653 --> 08:14.083
And after the death of Christ it was even
worse because they were persecuted, they were

08:14.083 --> 08:18.713
killed, they were tortured, crucified!

08:18.713 --> 08:28.603
It happened with Moses also – his disciples
were hounded so they had to all run towards

08:28.603 --> 08:29.603
India.

08:29.603 --> 08:32.123
Imagine the distances!

08:32.123 --> 08:40.722
From that area to Kashmir – how they must
have walked, how they must have lived, how

08:40.722 --> 08:43.392
they must have carried.

08:43.392 --> 08:48.592
And in thousands, in thousands they came,
to India.

08:48.592 --> 08:56.123
Because they realised that they are doing
a tremendous task.

08:56.123 --> 09:00.593
Something so great that they are supporting.

09:00.593 --> 09:05.332
In this country we had a struggle of freedom.

09:05.332 --> 09:07.012
I was part and parcel of that.

09:07.012 --> 09:09.572
My parents were part and parcel of that.

09:09.572 --> 09:14.132
They were rich people, quite rich I should
say, from every standard.

09:14.132 --> 09:18.772
You will be amazed – my father burnt all
his suits.

09:18.772 --> 09:21.903
They were stitched in England.

09:21.903 --> 09:25.053
My mother burnt all her saris.

09:25.053 --> 09:32.522
They used to spin their own clothes and wear
them.

09:32.522 --> 09:40.272
My father sacrificed everything, every pie
that he had, for the freedom struggle (1 pie

09:40.272 --> 09:41.272
= rupee 1/192).

09:41.272 --> 09:45.123
He left nothing for us, not a single [pie].

09:45.123 --> 09:50.502
Of course, our family being rich we had silver
and gold and all that but as far as all the

09:50.502 --> 09:55.053
cash money was concerned – was spent.

09:55.053 --> 09:59.892
And all this silver and gold also, thanks
to English, that they took away from us and

09:59.892 --> 10:02.443
they returned us when they went back.

10:02.443 --> 10:07.142
That’s how we had some silver and gold left
in the family.

10:07.142 --> 10:10.312
Every thing, all that is material, was snatched
away.

10:10.312 --> 10:11.312
And I know.

10:11.312 --> 10:16.183
We lived in beautiful houses and then we shifted
to huts and lived there.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.183
Sacrifices to the maximum.

10:17.183 --> 10:21.552
And we were very happy about it, very proud!

10:21.552 --> 10:23.993
We had only two changes (of clothes).

10:23.993 --> 10:26.153
We used to wash our clothes.

10:26.153 --> 10:33.552
We lived like very poor people; sleeping on
this kind of thing (thin, rough floor mats).

10:33.552 --> 10:46.044
For my life, I remember that I never used
to take a pillow; I never used chappals (sandals)

10:46.044 --> 10:47.044
for ages.

10:47.044 --> 10:51.613
I had only one sweater made of this kind of
a material.

10:51.613 --> 10:58.132
Till I passed out and went to medical college,
I had that sweater with me.

10:58.132 --> 11:04.152
I had only one coat, throughout my education
when I was in Lahore which was terribly cold

11:04.152 --> 11:11.382
– sometimes can be like London – which
was worn out and finished.

11:11.382 --> 11:16.593
But we never grudged and never grumbled and
never said that our father should have looked

11:16.593 --> 11:22.012
after us and done something, “Why did he
just sacrifice everything for the country?”

11:22.012 --> 11:23.012
Never!

11:23.012 --> 11:24.012
Never!

11:24.012 --> 11:25.012
Never!

11:25.012 --> 11:33.933
But even today, when they see us anywhere,
they know we are the children of such a great

11:33.933 --> 11:34.933
man.

11:34.933 --> 11:37.952
They have tremendous respect for us.

11:37.952 --> 11:43.363
That quality was created, I should say by
Mahatma Gandhi.

11:43.363 --> 11:52.483
He made everybody so transformed into a new
personality of tremendous sacrifice!

11:52.483 --> 11:53.493
Tremendous!

11:53.493 --> 11:57.572
You cannot imagine how people lived!

11:57.572 --> 12:06.202
All the money we had, everything that we had,
all conveniences and conveyances, all housing,

12:06.202 --> 12:12.093
everything, was given up – not only by my
father but so many of them.

12:12.093 --> 12:19.182
Otherwise we could have not got our freedom.

12:19.182 --> 12:25.112
To get our freedom this country has sacrificed
so much.

12:25.112 --> 12:38.543
Now, after that, we are here to get our freedom,
to get the freedom for our Spirit.

12:38.543 --> 12:47.942
To make our Spirit free from our greed, lust;
from your anger, from our conditionings, from

12:47.942 --> 13:02.413
our terrible ego, from the body being enslaved
by comforts.

13:02.413 --> 13:06.133
I must say Gandhiji had a special charm.

13:06.133 --> 13:09.252
I don’t know how he managed.

13:09.252 --> 13:15.873
He was like Touch of Midas – he touched
anybody and he became transformed.

13:15.873 --> 13:26.082
And he was an extremely strict man – very
kind to me, to children – but he was an

13:26.082 --> 13:27.653
extremely strict man.

13:27.653 --> 13:30.653
He would not tolerate any nonsense at all!

13:30.653 --> 13:41.372
Throughout, if you study in the way all these
people were brought up, not only for freedom

13:41.372 --> 13:50.062
of independence, but even before that, for
Spiritual life, anywhere, there’s one thing

13:50.062 --> 13:54.403
very common – is sacrifice.

13:54.403 --> 14:01.512
And the consciousness that you are doing something
great, consciousness that you are part and

14:01.512 --> 14:11.272
parcel of the whole, such a big thing, such
a big work, such a noble cause!!

14:11.272 --> 14:30.122
And then there was one thing very common among
all of them: that the noble cause, the upliftment

14:30.122 --> 14:38.613
(sic) of the noble cause, made them sacrifice
in such a sahaj manner.

14:38.613 --> 14:42.712
Much more than the Sahaj Yogis sometimes,
who have got so much in Sahaj Yoga.

14:42.712 --> 14:45.442
They have got their joy, they have got their
Spirit.

14:45.442 --> 14:51.903
But I have seen with my own eyes, such people
in this country; whom you may call legendary

14:51.903 --> 14:54.752
but I have seen it.

14:54.752 --> 14:59.132
Thousands of people were killed and butchered,
children died.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.762
Nobody shed tears.

15:00.762 --> 15:04.553
Nobody shed tears.

15:04.553 --> 15:22.142
But to feel that you are for such a noble
cause itself gives you that joy and that sense

15:22.142 --> 15:24.903
of involvement!

15:24.903 --> 15:33.252
And moreover, what I know about Mahatma Gandhi
and other people, what I have seen, how they

15:33.252 --> 15:38.572
were – everybody was not allowed to come
in.

15:38.572 --> 15:46.572
And anybody who did slightest thing less,
whether he was king’s son or he was anybody’s

15:46.572 --> 15:55.853
daughter or anything, any little thing they
spoilt, anything – he was chucked out.

15:55.853 --> 16:01.932
I have stayed in Gandhi’s ashram, so I know
what it is, and that’s why you know I can

16:01.932 --> 16:03.582
go through rigorous life.

16:03.582 --> 16:05.232
It is his training.

16:05.232 --> 16:11.892
All the children above twelve years had to
clean the whole of that ashram area – which

16:11.892 --> 16:15.343
is in fifty acres of land – every morning.

16:15.343 --> 16:20.922
They had to clean their latrines.

16:20.922 --> 16:24.603
Also the latrines of the guests.

16:24.603 --> 16:29.692
I have cleaned!

16:29.692 --> 16:34.423
And they were allowed only two dresses.

16:34.423 --> 16:39.233
And nothing could be kept, even you cannot
see one paper anywhere, any litter anywhere

16:39.233 --> 16:45.022
– so clean, spick and span.

16:45.022 --> 16:50.232
And the living places were so neat and tidy.

16:50.232 --> 16:55.882
It was all done with cow dung, completely
with cow dung.

16:55.882 --> 17:03.593
Everybody had to take a bath, early in the
morning at 4 o’ clock, with cold water.

17:03.593 --> 17:12.353
Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru or Abdul Kalam
Azad, my father, of any age group, or a child.

17:12.353 --> 17:17.853
And 5 o’clock, mahatma Gandhi was there
for his lecture.

17:17.853 --> 17:21.423
Please don’t raise your hands or raise your
Kundalinis!

17:21.423 --> 17:22.503
Please be seated!

17:22.503 --> 17:23.933
That’s not the way!

17:23.933 --> 17:28.303
Try to understand what I am talking!

17:28.303 --> 17:40.233
And then, early in the morning at 4 o’clock,
you will be surprised, getting up.

17:40.233 --> 17:44.553
For me it was alright!

17:44.553 --> 17:53.693
And then to walk in that fifty acres of land
to centre of that hall, which was nothing

17:53.693 --> 17:59.323
but just an open space surrounded by some
sort of huts where Gandhiji was living.

17:59.323 --> 18:03.473
To walk all the way after bath, after getting
ready and all that.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.983
And snakes used to crawl along.

18:06.983 --> 18:08.443
Nobody was bitten, of course.

18:08.443 --> 18:17.723
I think the snakes understood that people
were busy with the great job of freeing this

18:17.723 --> 18:19.953
great country!

18:19.953 --> 18:27.503
And we would sit just like this and the snakes
would be crawling.

18:27.503 --> 18:29.053
No lights were allowed.

18:29.053 --> 18:32.233
No lights of any kind.

18:32.233 --> 18:38.533
We only used sunlight.

18:38.533 --> 18:43.493
And when Gandhiji would come – I mean sunlight
was not there in the morning, at all – some

18:43.493 --> 18:48.163
lanterns were brought to put there.

18:48.163 --> 18:51.463
And we would see the snakes crawling up.

18:51.463 --> 18:55.263
But I never heard anybody complaining.

18:55.263 --> 19:06.193
But like a war, drove with such passion, everybody,
competing as to, “What I can do?

19:06.193 --> 19:09.893
How I can be alright?”

19:09.893 --> 19:15.513
Nobody even thought of comfort!

19:15.513 --> 19:28.933
Of course they were all up to 50 years of
age or something like that, maybe.

19:28.933 --> 19:35.543
In the ashram mostly people were up to fifty
years of age – at that time.

19:35.543 --> 19:46.863
And I have seen by my own eyes the people
who had huge cars in the house and things

19:46.863 --> 19:51.863
like that, they sold [them] off, they threw
it away.

19:51.863 --> 19:55.093
They used to come by train to Wardha station
and walk down.

19:55.093 --> 19:58.813
Gandhiji would not see anybody coming even
in tonga (horse-cart).

19:58.813 --> 20:06.043
And they listened to him and obeyed him.

20:06.043 --> 20:11.943
I have seen many missionaries, though they
are not up to point, nothing very noble, but

20:11.943 --> 20:16.133
that’s how they take people to task and
people work it out for them.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.133
I have seen them.

20:17.133 --> 20:26.953
In India we had missionaries, and younger
people who came from abroad, they just absolutely

20:26.953 --> 20:35.583
obediently listened to the missionaries and
did whatever they said.

20:35.583 --> 20:43.513
Now today we are doing, as you know, the greatest
of greatest work!

20:43.513 --> 20:49.573
Because freedom is of course necessary, political
freedom, to talk about the God.

20:49.573 --> 20:53.323
We could not even make a small, little needle!

20:53.323 --> 20:55.583
At that time we were not allowed by government.

20:55.583 --> 20:56.583
So much oppressed.

20:56.583 --> 21:01.543
So we had to get out of the shackles of slavery.

21:01.543 --> 21:04.593
No doubt.

21:04.593 --> 21:17.403
But now I find we have another kind of slavery
– a slavery of selfishness, self oriented.

21:17.403 --> 21:19.673
“This is my comfort.

21:19.673 --> 21:25.613
I must have this, it should be enjoyable,
I am enjoying, I am this, I am that."

21:25.613 --> 21:27.713
You should enjoy otherwise it is not something
great.

21:27.713 --> 21:37.283
I mean the whole thing should provide you
some sort of a feeling instead of you providing

21:37.283 --> 21:38.673
the feeling.

21:38.673 --> 21:47.503
Because people, I think, do not know what
they are doing, what sort of a work they are

21:47.503 --> 21:48.503
doing.

21:48.503 --> 21:53.695
They do not want to come to that level of
that height to see what are you up to.

21:53.695 --> 21:59.803
You are trying to save the whole world!

21:59.803 --> 22:06.003
This is one of the reasons Sahaj Yoga moves
so slowly, because I see people who are worried

22:06.003 --> 22:11.303
about their comforts, this, that, and also
themselves are so lousy!

22:11.303 --> 22:20.623
There’s no smartness about them, no feeling
of that greatness that they have to do.

22:20.623 --> 22:21.623
You have to be smart.

22:21.623 --> 22:31.063
If you know you are on war – how you behave?

22:31.063 --> 22:36.073
I am sure the mediocrity is much less now,
better people.

22:36.073 --> 22:40.443
I am sure we will get even better people now,
much better people!

22:40.443 --> 22:45.773
They worry about little, little things: of
their family, this, that.

22:45.773 --> 22:51.573
They worry about their own problems, and their
jobs, and this and that.

22:51.573 --> 22:53.883
I mean nobody could talk like this to Gandhiji!

22:53.883 --> 22:57.853
I tell you, he would have slapped you!

22:57.853 --> 23:01.303
Take it from me.

23:01.303 --> 23:07.503
It is as if to come to Sahaj Yoga means – solve
your problems – that’s all.

23:07.503 --> 23:12.843
Though they are solved, no doubt, you are
helped, God helps you so much.

23:12.843 --> 23:15.663
But how much are you doing about it?

23:15.663 --> 23:27.143
Of course we have some very great Sahaj yogis,
I would not deny that fact, we have some – much

23:27.143 --> 23:31.623
more than I had, ever – and that’s why
I am very joyous about it.

23:31.623 --> 23:39.093
But the dedication we have: we count every
penny that we spend, how much we have got

23:39.093 --> 23:42.423
out of that penny, what did we do about it.

23:42.423 --> 23:48.433
This is not
the way!

23:48.433 --> 23:50.394
Buddha never spent a single penny of his own.

23:50.394 --> 23:52.323
He got money from all his disciples.

23:52.323 --> 23:54.553
Built all these big things and all that.

23:54.553 --> 24:01.873
He never had even a public help from anybody
else.

24:01.873 --> 24:03.113
So rise now!

24:03.113 --> 24:06.713
You must rise above your petty small mind.

24:06.713 --> 24:14.173
Rise up to the point where you should know
[that] you are going to save the whole humanity.

24:14.173 --> 24:20.883
If you cannot feel that, it’s better to
leave Sahaj Yoga.

24:20.883 --> 24:25.853
Sahaj Yoga is not meant for the people who
are lousy.

24:25.853 --> 24:27.923
In Marathi the word is ‘gabale’.

24:27.923 --> 24:37.933
Tukaram has said, “yerya gabalyache kaama
nohe” (meaning) “It is not the work of

24:37.933 --> 24:39.873
the lousy!”

24:39.873 --> 24:50.213
Shivaji himself, when he fought his war, he
caught hold of people, the sartaras and the

24:50.213 --> 24:52.413
dukes of that time they were.

24:52.413 --> 24:57.753
They gave up everything they had, they gave
up their lives, every thing!

24:57.753 --> 25:02.064
Their children they sacrificed, they sacrificed
whatever they had!

25:02.064 --> 25:07.753
Shivaji had no money to pay them.

25:07.753 --> 25:12.923
You must have heard lots of stories about
Shivaji.

25:12.923 --> 25:19.613
While if you see how we Sahaj yogis are in
this world: kshema (well-being) comes before

25:19.613 --> 25:20.613
yoga.

25:20.613 --> 25:22.483
Its like that.

25:22.483 --> 25:25.313
Its your mother’s love.

25:25.313 --> 25:28.093
I want my children to be comfortable.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.093
They are newly born babes.

25:29.093 --> 25:37.453
Alright, they need comfort, they are to be
looked after.

25:37.453 --> 25:47.553
But I cannot blackmail the Divine because
the children are small can I!

25:47.553 --> 25:53.803
I am here to do the job of God Almighty.

25:53.803 --> 26:03.333
And when you are my children his grace will
work, He’ll look after you, He’ll make

26:03.333 --> 26:04.543
you grow.

26:04.543 --> 26:06.353
But grow now!

26:06.353 --> 26:07.353
Grow!

26:07.353 --> 26:08.353
You have to grow!

26:08.353 --> 26:12.293
Get out of this small nonsense that you are!

26:12.293 --> 26:15.473
See your personality – how do you live?

26:15.473 --> 26:18.133
Where is your attention?

26:18.133 --> 26:19.523
What do you think?

26:19.523 --> 26:24.953
Are you thinking about Sahaj Yoga, that it
is the most important thing for which you

26:24.953 --> 26:28.793
are chosen?

26:28.793 --> 26:42.173
I feel sometimes, as I was feeling all the
time, that you might be uncomfortable in many

26:42.173 --> 26:43.173
places.

26:43.173 --> 26:48.333
But I myself have seen the way you people
have been in those places, most carelessly

26:48.333 --> 26:51.873
– the Western Sahaj yogis, I was surprised.

26:51.873 --> 26:56.123
That way Indians are better in this respect.

26:56.123 --> 27:00.883
And some of the Indian Sahaj yogis have been
misbehaving in a very funny manner.

27:00.883 --> 27:01.883
It shocked me!

27:01.883 --> 27:07.573
The way they have been behaving, shouting
at people, creating problems.

27:07.573 --> 27:12.953
Some people come to see me, they talk to them
in such a rude manner that they run away.

27:12.953 --> 27:15.573
You can talk to them sweetly.

27:15.573 --> 27:18.423
You have to be nice to them; not to shout
at people.

27:18.423 --> 27:23.363
Alright, I cannot meet everyone at every time,
at every convenience, but that does not mean

27:23.363 --> 27:28.423
that you have right to shout at others.

27:28.423 --> 27:37.943
This is so petty and so low that I don’t
know how far I have to come down!

27:37.943 --> 27:47.933
When you rise above all these petty things,
you will develop that Divine discretion.

27:47.933 --> 27:51.673
That Divine discretion is the real blessing
of God.

27:51.673 --> 27:57.523
All other blessings, that you think is a blessing,
is no blessing at all!

27:57.523 --> 28:01.873
Unless and until you can grow, what is the
blessing?

28:01.873 --> 28:06.353
Like a tree which says, “Oh, such a blessing
that I have got rain!”

28:06.353 --> 28:12.733
But out of that rain if you cannot grow, what’s
the use of having that rain on you?

28:12.733 --> 28:27.743
You have to be compassionate, beautiful, sensible
people, who are the highest beings on this

28:27.743 --> 28:28.743
earth.

28:28.743 --> 28:35.563
Take out your attention from all nonsense
that you have been busy with.

28:35.563 --> 28:42.713
That’s how you get possessed, that’s how
you get conditioned.

28:42.713 --> 28:46.943
Small, small things you see.

28:46.943 --> 28:52.123
In India we have another problem: We cannot
tolerate another person.

28:52.123 --> 28:56.373
If any person is doing good for Sahaj Yoga,
immediately a group is built up (against them)

28:56.373 --> 28:57.883
– it’s very common with Indians also.

28:57.883 --> 29:04.103
A group is built up to put him down.

29:04.103 --> 29:09.513
This was not done when Gandhiji was there.

29:09.513 --> 29:12.703
I do not know how it happens.

29:12.703 --> 29:15.903
It only happens with poor leadership.

29:15.903 --> 29:18.963
I think I don’t have that leadership!

29:18.963 --> 29:23.863
At the time of Gandhiji he used to blast people
out completely!

29:23.863 --> 29:32.053
Cutting each other’s throats and saying
things behind the back, forming groups.

29:32.053 --> 29:37.263
Anybody who works out something nice, and
I try to help that person to express himself,

29:37.263 --> 29:44.193
immediately a group comes up to press him.

29:44.193 --> 29:48.343
And there are some hopelessly peripheral,
useless Sahaj Yogis in the West and in the

29:48.343 --> 29:53.523
East, who try to make a mess of things.

29:53.523 --> 29:57.333
They think, they are big gurus, big people!

29:57.333 --> 29:58.933
Very small people.

29:58.933 --> 30:01.513
Chicken hearted, I should say.

30:01.513 --> 30:07.353
And they think they are very big, great people,
because they can take good photographs, maybe,

30:07.353 --> 30:11.613
or that they can wear a dress in a particular
manner, or something like that – stupid

30:11.613 --> 30:14.053
stuff as they are!

30:14.053 --> 30:18.523
And trying to dominate others.

30:18.523 --> 30:22.353
Such people will be thrown out, absolutely.

30:22.353 --> 30:28.483
No use having useless people in a machine
like this.

30:28.483 --> 30:38.163
Today is the beginning of a new era – of
a new era of people of very high qualities

30:38.163 --> 30:43.103
whose Spirit has been enlightened.

30:43.103 --> 30:49.033
Let us all think about it!

30:49.033 --> 30:57.363
Now you have to rule yourself, and you have
to rule others through compassion, love and

30:57.363 --> 30:58.363
discretion!!

30:58.363 --> 31:04.923
Today that’s the big time that I have declared
that it is the Universal Religion, the Nirmala

31:04.923 --> 31:12.383
Religion which is formed out of my teachings
of love.

31:12.383 --> 31:16.623
But it doesn’t mean by any chance that you
remain dwarfs!

31:16.623 --> 31:22.823
I’m not going to spoil you!

31:22.823 --> 31:29.173
I am not going to spoil you by keeping you
dwarfy people!

31:29.173 --> 31:34.013
So try to rise!

31:34.013 --> 31:35.853
Do not dominate others.

31:35.853 --> 31:36.943
Respect!

31:36.943 --> 31:39.763
Respect each other!

31:39.763 --> 31:46.283
You are out for a very big work of Viraat.

31:46.283 --> 31:54.113
How much you know about the Divine nobody
has known so far!

31:54.113 --> 31:55.913
But fix up yourself.

31:55.913 --> 32:04.633
I have known a very great saint called Gagangadh
Maharaj who has fallen down completely!

32:04.633 --> 32:09.703
If a person like him can fall down you also
can fall down if you do not understand what

32:09.703 --> 32:17.733
is your worth, what is your value and what
is your position you are given.

32:17.733 --> 32:25.514
So we have to, today, with all our love for
our Mother, have to decide in our heart, that

32:25.514 --> 32:27.673
we are going to have large heartedness, of
sacrifices!

32:27.673 --> 32:31.203
What have we sacrificed so far?

32:31.203 --> 32:32.683
Just think of it.

32:32.683 --> 32:33.683
Have we?

32:33.683 --> 32:45.133
Did we sacrifice anything?

32:45.133 --> 32:57.373
Please try to understand that I have to use
you, the great souls, to save the humanity.

32:57.373 --> 32:58.373
You must grow.

32:58.373 --> 32:59.373
You must grow.

32:59.373 --> 33:00.373
You have to grow.

33:00.373 --> 33:05.403
On money points also people are wretched.

33:05.403 --> 33:08.043
They make money.

33:08.043 --> 33:11.143
They save money.

33:11.143 --> 33:19.933
In America, I was surprised, the way people
cheated me of money!

33:19.933 --> 33:21.173
Thousands!

33:21.173 --> 33:28.663
In India also this is a very common practice!

33:28.663 --> 33:38.593
Then if you have career mindedness, and you
are very ambitious, “How my job will remain?”

33:38.593 --> 33:45.513
this, that – you better get out of Sahaj
Yoga!

33:45.513 --> 33:52.873
It’s not going to help us at all!

33:52.873 --> 33:59.203
Thirdly there are people who believe that,
“This is my wife, this is my beloved, this

33:59.203 --> 34:00.773
is this,” and all that nonsense.

34:00.773 --> 34:02.353
Why are you here?

34:02.353 --> 34:03.843
For what?

34:03.843 --> 34:13.493
Or “My children, my household, my mother,
my father."

34:13.493 --> 34:17.213
all sorts of wretched people around!

34:17.213 --> 34:24.633
If you cannot rise above that, you cannot
help me, I am sorry.

34:24.633 --> 34:27.133
You cannot help me.

34:27.133 --> 34:32.643
You have to be very, very strong people.

34:32.643 --> 34:42.743
You have to be people of very great valour
and great idealism and noble ideas.

34:42.743 --> 34:55.543
Some are like petty shopkeepers who follow
the platoons to sell some things around – in

34:55.543 --> 35:01.963
Marathi it is called ‘bazar bhunge’!

35:01.963 --> 35:16.863
So now you meditate on this point that here
we are to establish the Universal Religion

35:16.863 --> 35:17.863
of ascent.

35:17.863 --> 35:21.103
It is a tremendous task!

35:21.103 --> 35:31.147
If I could do it alone I would have done it
but I cannot.

35:31.147 --> 35:34.963
It’s only through you I have to do it.

35:34.963 --> 35:35.963
And you have a heritage.

35:35.963 --> 35:50.893
You come from a very great birth, where you
have this heritage.

35:50.893 --> 36:00.383
With that heritage, if I cannot manage you,
I think I better give up your leadership.

36:00.383 --> 36:03.643
I cannot do it!

36:03.643 --> 36:14.043
When we were fighting for our freedom all
of us were removed from schools because we

36:14.043 --> 36:19.963
were in the missionary school and the missionaries
believed that Christ was born in England!

36:19.963 --> 36:21.893
So they would not allow us to study in those
schools.

36:21.893 --> 36:23.733
So we were all removed from those schools.

36:23.733 --> 36:25.843
We had no education for some time.

36:25.843 --> 36:29.333
I couldn’t pass my inter-science for two
years.

36:29.333 --> 36:35.713
I couldn’t appear because they rusticated
us from colleges and schools.

36:35.713 --> 36:42.613
The government rusticated us.

36:42.613 --> 36:47.073
But we were such proud children, very proud.

36:47.073 --> 36:50.263
I was of course very much thick in it.

36:50.263 --> 36:51.263
I was never frightened.

36:51.263 --> 36:52.903
I was just an eighteen year old girl.

36:52.903 --> 37:02.123
And I remember one day some people came and
told us that your father is transferred from

37:02.123 --> 37:04.823
this jail to another jail.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.923
They had such pride for all of us, all the
people!

37:07.923 --> 37:09.903
So they had brought cars to take us down.

37:09.903 --> 37:16.052
And they were so many there.

37:16.052 --> 37:19.723
And [my] mother naturally was worried because
I was a young girl.

37:19.723 --> 37:25.433
The police used to torture me, used to give
me [electric] shocks, and make my life very

37:25.433 --> 37:27.543
miserable, beat me, and all that.

37:27.543 --> 37:34.313
So she was crying and she told an old gentleman
who was there that, “I am worried about

37:34.313 --> 37:35.313
my daughter.

37:35.313 --> 37:40.302
I do not want her to be tortured anymore."

37:40.302 --> 37:46.993
So I went and smiled at him, so he said, “No,
you stop it now!

37:46.993 --> 37:49.043
You just don’t do it.

37:49.043 --> 37:50.753
It’s not proper."

37:50.753 --> 37:56.563
So my father took me aside, he said, “Don’t
listen to this ‘old johnny’!

37:56.563 --> 37:59.533
He’s now about to die.

37:59.533 --> 38:02.073
Forget him.

38:02.073 --> 38:09.813
I would like all my children to be sacrificed
on the altar of freedom.

38:09.813 --> 38:12.773
If you are doing it I am a proud father.

38:12.773 --> 38:16.093
And I will tell your mother to behave herself.

38:16.093 --> 38:25.213
I am so proud of you!”

38:25.213 --> 38:28.555
Such atmosphere I have passed through.

38:28.555 --> 38:32.302
I had to give up my college.

38:32.302 --> 38:34.963
I was absconding for eight months.

38:34.963 --> 38:38.323
The police was after my life.

38:38.323 --> 38:39.653
I know what we have gone through.

38:39.653 --> 38:42.623
We were very young people -eighteen years.

38:42.623 --> 38:45.063
You can imagine!

38:45.063 --> 38:57.103
And now when you have got the freedom of your
Spirit you must seek the comfort of your Spirit.

38:57.103 --> 39:01.323
There are some people who are complainers,
and this and that -nonsense.

39:01.323 --> 39:02.853
They should not have come!

39:02.853 --> 39:08.883
Or those who are Indians – they should get
out of Sahaj Yoga and leave us alone.

39:08.883 --> 39:16.773
But, those who know that they have come here,
not to enjoy themselves only, but to make

39:16.773 --> 39:21.613
the whole world enjoy what you have got, to
give it to them.

39:21.613 --> 39:31.183
And for that one has to sacrifice, one has
to bear the pangs!

39:31.183 --> 39:37.173
How much I bear your pangs when you are caught
up, when you have troubles, when this and

39:37.173 --> 39:38.173
that.

39:38.173 --> 39:39.563
I have got blisters sometimes, from you, everything.

39:39.563 --> 39:48.983
But I don’t mind because it is my life,
my mission, my existence, my everything- is

39:48.983 --> 39:52.903
for the purpose of emancipation of humanity.

39:52.903 --> 39:57.393
Even the last drop of my blood is for that.

39:57.393 --> 40:01.073
So my satisfactions are very different.

40:01.073 --> 40:10.143
Please remember, you are born of a very brave
Mother.

40:10.143 --> 40:12.463
Please, try to rise!

40:12.463 --> 40:19.163
Be proud that you are doing such a tremendous
task.

40:19.163 --> 40:27.493
Have that feeling of great valour.

40:27.493 --> 40:33.423
Then only, then only, we can achieve results!

40:33.423 --> 40:38.013
You have seen so many wars, you have seen
so many war pictures, you have seen how people

40:38.013 --> 40:41.603
have fought, how they have sacrificed themselves.

40:41.603 --> 40:53.233
And let us see what are we doing in this war!

40:53.233 --> 40:56.903
Just make your body your slave.

40:56.903 --> 41:08.943
Get out of the slavery of your body, of your
conditionings, and your nonsensical ego.

41:08.943 --> 41:15.013
I am sure as a Mother I am not so bad.

41:15.013 --> 41:22.703
But as a father I think I lack some things.

41:22.703 --> 41:35.653
Please try to come up so that I should feel
that I did not lack in my fatherly attitude

41:35.653 --> 41:44.973
towards you – that awe, that understanding
of a father’s expectations.

41:44.973 --> 41:55.313
This I am not saying to you because it is
some present situation, because a few people

41:55.313 --> 42:02.733
particularly, or for anything which is very,
very sort of [a] present day problem.

42:02.733 --> 42:04.923
None of these things.

42:04.923 --> 42:15.633
But is my announcement of this new dimension
into which we have to rise.

42:15.633 --> 42:21.042
And as in the war, we have to declare, “Now
forward on!”

42:21.042 --> 42:23.613
In the same way this is a declaration.

42:23.613 --> 42:29.763
In no way to degrade you, in no way to insult
you, or to say anything about anyone of you.

42:29.763 --> 42:39.753
But to just infuse that inspiration which
led thousands and thousands and millions and

42:39.753 --> 42:47.163
billions of people to sacrifice for a greater
cause!

42:47.163 --> 42:52.873
So now have respect for yourself.

42:52.873 --> 42:53.873
Raise your heads!

42:53.873 --> 42:58.383
You are the ones who are going to fight.

42:58.383 --> 43:02.093
You are the ones who are responsible.

43:02.093 --> 43:03.613
Prepare yourself!

43:03.613 --> 43:05.783
Prepare your body.

43:05.783 --> 43:09.893
Prepare your mind!

43:09.893 --> 43:12.643
Be discreet!

43:12.643 --> 43:20.763
This is my, I would not say ‘request’
again.

43:20.763 --> 43:22.903
This is my order!

43:22.903 --> 43:28.733
May God bless you!

43:28.733 --> 43:36.012
Let us all meditate now!

43:36.012 --> 43:39.303
There is no need for tying up your Kundalinis.

43:39.303 --> 43:40.943
There is no need to give yourself bandhan.

43:40.943 --> 43:45.443
There is no need at all to do anything.

43:45.443 --> 43:48.193
If you come up to that stage just now.

43:48.193 --> 43:51.433
There’s no need to raise your hands and
tying up your Kundalini – not necessary.

43:51.433 --> 43:55.583
Nothing is to be done!

43:55.583 --> 44:01.263
Your Kundalinis are already tied up.

44:01.263 --> 44:02.323
Assume!

44:02.323 --> 44:04.523
Assume that situation, that’s all!

44:04.523 --> 44:26.493
That’s what you are – the veeras and not
the stupid!

44:26.493 --> 44:27.493
Respect yourself.

44:27.493 --> 44:28.493
Respect!

44:28.493 --> 44:29.743
May God bless you all.

44:29.743 --> 44:38.943
There’s nothing, nothing more important
to me than to see you rise to that level of

44:38.943 --> 44:42.983
understanding of your own values and worth
and discretion.

44:42.983 --> 44:55.823
You have to become sweet, nice people but
very, very powerful!

44:55.823 --> 44:59.433
That you can control yourself, your tongues
and your things.

44:59.433 --> 45:06.052
The control, complete control of your self.

45:06.052 --> 45:14.293
May God bless you again!

45:14.293 --> 45:16.373
Please meditate.

45:16.373 --> 45:19.493
Close your eyes!

45:19.493 --> 45:22.603
Close your eyes!

45:22.603 --> 45:26.763
Just close your eyes.

45:26.763 --> 45:34.033
Put your both the hands towards me.

45:34.033 --> 45:38.023
Put your attention onto Sahastrara!

45:38.023 --> 45:39.593
Just your attention onto Sahastrara.

45:39.593 --> 45:42.713
You are in my Sahastrara all of you just now.

45:42.713 --> 45:45.033
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.

45:45.033 --> 45:47.983
There’s no thought, nothing.

45:47.983 --> 45:58.993
Just put your attention to your…and just
rise up to that point.

45:58.993 --> 46:04.933
There’s no drama about it.

46:04.933 --> 46:08.493
There’s nothing artificial.

46:08.493 --> 46:10.873
It’s actualisation.

46:10.873 --> 46:14.753
All weaknesses are to be left behind.

46:14.753 --> 46:47.033
Let’s be strong people of strong values
with dignity and sobriety.

50:47.033 --> 50:50.353
Silence, absolute inner silence.

50:50.353 --> 50:53.073
And one need not talk too much.

50:53.073 --> 51:03.033
Too much to jabber, to talk, frivolously,
is not your way.

51:03.042 --> 51:33.763
Feel it in your heart, your own dignity, your
own glory, the serenity of behaviour.

51:45.433 --> 51:54.833
You are all saints, but saints of very high
quality, of very high quality.

51:54.833 --> 51:55.833
Not ordinary type.

53:44.533 --> 53:46.033
Put your attention to Sahastrara.

53:46.033 --> 53:48.853
Chitta aple Sahastrara tevaitze.

53:48.853 --> 53:56.333
Apne Sahastrar pe apna Chitta tev. (Marathi: Put your attention to your Sahastrara)

54:56.433 --> 55:01.513
Any thought coming say, “Not this, not this,
not this."

55:18.433 --> 55:20.433
May God bless you.

55:41.433 --> 55:48.913
I would like to see all the groups some time,
one by one, all the leaders and also certain

55:48.913 --> 55:54.093
individuals who want to see me.

55:54.093 --> 56:11.573
We are going to have marriages, and everything,
performed here and it’s going to work out

56:11.573 --> 56:12.433
very well.

56:12.933 --> 56:16.293
But suddenly don’t jump onto the thing!

56:16.933 --> 56:28.313
Do it in your sobriety, in understanding that,
this marriage is nothing but because you have

56:28.313 --> 56:38.653
to have children of very high quality. Secondly it has to be auspicious.

56:40.433 --> 56:45.173
Just to wash off if there was any inauspiciousness.

56:56.733 --> 57:10.853
I hope you will enjoy your heights now, you
will enjoy you glory and you will enjoy your noble work.

57:10.853 --> 57:12.733
May God bless you.
