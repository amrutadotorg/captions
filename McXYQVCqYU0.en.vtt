00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:07.568
TV Staff: Might be nice to chill out
TV Staff: I think so

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:09.793
TV Staff: Andrew
TV Staff: It's the time now

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:13.010
TV Staff Andrew: Exactly! What did you had
to do because a couple of weeks ago

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.330
on the Sunrise we had an incredible response
to the [UNCLEAR - SOATBOT?] it was [UNCLEAR]

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.462
we did on meditation. Now we will look
at ways to find some peace and quiet

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:26.481
in a short space of time.
TV Staff: So, being National Stress Down Day

00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:30.471
we decided to get some more tips
on how to be stress-free.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:38.935
TV Reporter: No matter where you work,
there are places to be, places to see but

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:43.622
every now and then it's nice to tune out
to find some inner peace. So, in a small

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:49.125
experiment I put together the entire Sunrise
team to see how meditation will help us to

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:54.907
get through the day.
Dr. Ramesh Manocha: Something that you

00:00:54.907 --> 00:00:59.626
don't have to pay for, no secret mantras, no
ten day retreats, no donations, nothing.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.754
You just pick it up very easy and
TV Reporter: According to the Health of

00:01:02.754 --> 00:01:07.291
Meditation expert, Dr. Ramesh Manocha, we
down tools in our bustling production office,

00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:12.077
we learn how to achieve mental silence.
Dr. Manocha: We start with both hands

00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:17.175
on our lap, palm up, breathing gently in
and out through the nose, taking our

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:24.597
attention away from many external distractions.
Keeping our eyes closed, we put our right hand

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:29.048
on the top of the tummy, on the left side,
just below the ribs. Here, we just say to

00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:34.813
this energy of meditation within us, "I am
my own master." We just say slightly silently,

00:01:34.813 --> 00:01:41.270
so inside we silently, inside otherwise
we feel silly.

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:46.336
We take our hand to our heart,
so we can say here,

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:52.439
just a few times silently inside, "I am
the Spirit." Take our right hand towards

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.143
the left shoulder amidst the neck, turn the
head a little bit to the right and this is

00:01:56.143 --> 00:02:01.329
the center which accumulates a lot of pressure
or tension when we feel too much guilt, so

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.363
just to let go of that we say here, "I am
not guilty at all." Now we take the right

00:02:07.363 --> 00:02:13.731
hand to the forehead grasping the temples,
to let it all go, "I forgive everyone and everything."

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.970
We turn the right hand to the lap and sitting
quietly, just enjoying the silence within.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.830
Now we gently open our eyes and
that's the basic process

00:02:25.408 --> 00:02:29.758
TV Reporter: In a space of just 10 short
minutes Dr. Ramesh managed to transport

00:02:29.758 --> 00:02:33.580
most of us to different space.
TV Staff: There was one little thing

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.548
Another Staff: I had that as well.
TV Staff: and that's what I focused on
Another Staff: and I just went

00:02:36.548 --> 00:02:40.512
and things would come out and not go - no.
Yeah, I was surprised.

00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:44.554
Staff: I was surprised that we're sitting
above a busy newsroom with phones going off

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:49.585
and people having conversations
[UNCLEAR] to actually get out of that

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:54.373
space and forget where I was.
Staff: Yes, I felt myself so concentrated
on the breathing motor

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:58.936
TV Reporter: For just 5-10 minutes, twice
a day, it's enough to not spend in us,

00:02:58.974 --> 00:03:02.474
in just a couple of weeks.
Staff: So, who'd do it again?

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:09.960
TV Staff Andrew: It was amazing, wasn't it?
Staff: Oh, yeah! I was really surprised.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.730
because can't be cynical about that stuff
and I went to the happy place. I loved it.

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:21.669
TV Staff: And it's, and it's also, it was
in a busy office with lots of noise

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.759
and you do find yourself.
Reporter: Could you hear anything?

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.109
TV Staff : No
Reporter: I couldn't hear. I can't remember
hearing a phone even.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.133
TV Staff Andrew: It was great!.
Reporter: How are you?

00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:35.217
Staff: I wasn't quite where you went but I
felt myself slowing down my thoughts but I -

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:38.695
I was almost like a head sleeping hearing -
I could hear every little thing everywhere

00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:41.840
but you know, that's okay. Maybe my
happy place is just noisy.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.930
TV Staff Andrew: Full details of that is all
on our website. So, if you're interested

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.284
and you want to follow it, go the
Sunrise website - it's all there.

00:03:49.284 --> 00:03:53.089
TV Staff: And Ramesh was great -
that's also there.
Host: Why did they say are the costs of....
