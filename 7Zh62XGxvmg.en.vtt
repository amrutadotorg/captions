00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:09.584
Gandhiji was a tremendous man.
One has to learn a lot from him.

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:17.114
He was not at all a hypocrite, that's one
thing and he was not like modern, we say,

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.703
politicians, who say something do 
something - no - he was very outspoken

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:28.354
and always he put himself on the testing
point and he used to confess, if he made

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:34.465
mistakes, immediately. One very great
incident, I remember when I was a small child,

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:40.459
they were having a meeting together
and we girls were there only sitting,

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:47.828
giving them water and things to all the
people, all the big people were there like

00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:52.615
Jawaharlal Nehru was there and also Maulana
Azad, all these people were sitting there.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:57.508
They were discussing something and then
suddenly, Mahatmaji said that,

00:00:57.508 --> 00:01:04.023
"Now it's very late, we'll have lunch here,"
so, they said, "Yes, yes we'll have lunch here."

00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:09.167
They had to go to the guest house, which
was far away. So, Mahatmaji asked for the

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:15.193
Bai's, his wife - she had gone out - so,
he got up. He had a key with him, you see,

00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:19.951
always of this store room. He opened the
store room and he asked the people,

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:25.605
who were in charge of cooking, to measure
everything according to the people there are,

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:31.447
properly everything, you see and then when
they measured it out, everything was done

00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:37.414
then he put the key back and then he went
and sat there nicely. So, these people said,

00:01:37.414 --> 00:01:42.729
"Bapu, we did not know you had to take so
much trouble, you see, to go all the way

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.064
and measure out everything for us." He
didn't take much time (about) fifteen minutes,

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:53.174
but still, so he said, "What do you think?
This is the blood of my country, I cannot

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:58.838
allow it to be wasted." See, that's the sign of a
person, who understands the value of

00:01:58.838 --> 00:02:05.645
public money - that's just ingrained in
him but those who saw him, also felt

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:10.974
that, "Look at this man, who's living like
a ascetic, absolutely, in the sense that

00:02:10.974 --> 00:02:16.921
he would not touch the public money and 
that is one of the keys for all the leaders,

00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:23.370
if they are absolutely above the money,
then only people will respect, otherwise

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.185
there's no way out. But, if you find these
days in every country, so much of

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:32.464
corruption, hypocrisy, then you 
are really shocked.
