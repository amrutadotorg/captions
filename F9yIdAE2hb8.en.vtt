00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:09.711
When you put in an effort, you stand against becoming.

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:25.127
For example, if I have to cure you

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.627
I just put my hand and finished – no effort,

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:38.127
because I am that.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:44.792
You get your realisation because I am that.

00:00:48.043 --> 00:00:52.752
I don’t put in any effort, I don’t think about it, I am that.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.669
Just looking at someone, it can be done.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.544
Just putting attention to someone, it can be done.

00:01:17.294 --> 00:01:21.585
Just with a small desire, it can be done –

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:30.793
because you are that. You can mould it the way you like.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.960
You can get an example from gold.

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:43.793
Now gold is untarnishable

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.876
It does not have to think it is untarnishable,

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:51.043
it does not have to put in an effort it is untarnishable – it is.

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:10.752
So to be, to be, you don’t have to put in any effort.

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.835
If you have to put in an effort, that means you are not yet that.

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:29.419
If you look at the sun – it shines.

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:34.711
It doesn’t have to put in effort to shine – it shines.

00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:46.711
So to be that, if you have to put in an effort,

00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:50.711
that means you are not that, you are trying, you are artificial.

00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:05.460
The flowers are beautiful so they don’t have to beautify themselves.

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:16.210
And this is what one has to understand – that innately

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.876
if you are that,  if you have already become,

00:03:21.127 --> 00:03:23.793
then what is the need to put in any more effort?

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:38.752
But when we say these things, you see,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.544
then people think you have to be lethargic,

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:53.502
that you need not do anything,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.043
you become a Guru without doing anything.

00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:06.502
That’s why, at the very outset, I said it goes in stages.

00:04:12.876 --> 00:04:16.294
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:23.792
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.627
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:34.210
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.377
but surrendering means the worship,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.585
the respect of the higher,

00:04:56.792 --> 00:04:59.669
the obedience to the higher.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.544
Not to argue it out,

00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:12.918
not to react, acceptance,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.669
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.918
without questioning, without reasoning.

00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:33.752
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:41.585
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:45.335
So first is the state,

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:48.876
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.502
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

00:06:01.752 --> 00:06:08.085
If you can develop childhood first,

00:06:08.377 --> 00:06:11.669
then everything takes proper course,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.792
because maturity cannot take place unless

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.669
and until you start from the very beginning,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.377
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

00:06:45.294 --> 00:06:47.752
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.252
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.669
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:07.669
So try to develop your discretion power

00:07:12.876 --> 00:07:21.377
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

00:07:26.168 --> 00:07:30.876
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:41.752
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:52.127
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.792
or anti-innocence must be negated.

00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:12.168
So the negation of effort

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:18.585
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:27.792
means the effort of negation.

00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:35.168
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:46.627
you will have to put in effort for that.

00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:55.711
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:09.669
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:19.793
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:26.294
from effort that makes it adulterous.

00:09:37.918 --> 00:09:40.627
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

00:09:40.793 --> 00:09:44.585
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

00:09:50.335 --> 00:09:56.419
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.793
So those people who have come now,

00:10:09.252 --> 00:10:12.793
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:16.419
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

00:10:29.043 --> 00:10:33.168
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:35.876
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:39.127
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:52.294
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

00:10:52.502 --> 00:10:55.711
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

00:11:16.127 --> 00:11:18.210
Some people have an attention

00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:20.419
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

00:11:20.585 --> 00:11:23.002
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:41.711
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

00:11:48.127 --> 00:11:51.168
So the effort that you put in

00:11:51.585 --> 00:11:55.876
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:06.460
Another thing is very common, in the West,

00:12:06.752 --> 00:12:09.627
is the harsh tongue, the sarcasm

00:12:10.043 --> 00:12:15.627
and hurting others – is a very subtle way of violence.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.502
Or if they are really blunt

00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:35.502
they can start with ego expressions also “I, I, I…”

00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:44.669
Such people should stop talking

00:12:44.835 --> 00:12:48.127
completely, make an effort to stop – just don’t talk.

00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:56.502
Now watch your mind – is it

00:12:56.752 --> 00:13:00.502
is it trying to talk something sarcastic, nonsensical?

00:13:11.168 --> 00:13:14.168
So, this watching also requires effort.

00:13:22.043 --> 00:13:25.085
So, to sprout the seed is easy,

00:13:25.335 --> 00:13:30.168
but then one has to put in the effort to look after the little plant.

00:13:44.585 --> 00:13:48.460
And when it matures, then it’s on its own.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:14:00.627
So the, first the effort should be made to protect yourself

00:14:00.835 --> 00:14:04.127
against the mind which you have built in,

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:06.252
through your ego or superego,

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:10.711
that goes into the wrong direction of effort.

00:14:26.544 --> 00:14:30.585
But sometimes, be very careful, you have to be discreet.

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:44.918
And the best way to be safe on discretion is to keep in the centre –

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:48.502
never go to any extreme of anything.

00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:01.252
For example, some people are fond of music, say,

00:15:01.918 --> 00:15:05.335
so they’ll go on after the music part of it.

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:13.335
Some people, say, are fond of poetry,

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:16.460
then they’ll go after the poetry only.

00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:25.960
There is nothing wrong in those things,

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:30.669
but whatever you achieve in all these things

00:15:30.793 --> 00:15:33.002
must be brought back to the collective

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.544
and must be enjoyed by everyone,

00:15:35.793 --> 00:15:39.876
and you should also enjoy what others have found.

00:15:55.544 --> 00:16:01.460
For example, somebody is a very learned man and a dry person.

00:16:08.544 --> 00:16:13.752
So he has to make an effort to make himself sweet.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:24.252
So try to neutralise your extreme nature by coming in the centre,

00:16:32.669 --> 00:16:36.752
and the best way to say is, “I like everything.

00:16:44.792 --> 00:16:48.793
The way You keep me, I am happy in that state.”

00:16:56.585 --> 00:17:01.502
And to suggest yourself that, “I am the peace”

00:17:02.876 --> 00:17:06.043
– suggest, autosuggestion,

00:17:13.377 --> 00:17:18.544
“I am the satisfaction, I am the dignity.”

00:17:20.335 --> 00:17:24.127
Try to impose these artificialities upon yourself

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.502
of these virtues and righteousness,

00:17:42.544 --> 00:17:47.168
and then ask yourself “If I am dignified how can I do such a thing?”

00:17:47.544 --> 00:17:51.876
Ask yourself, you judge yourself with those.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:07.460
For example, somebody is a miserly person

00:18:07.752 --> 00:18:09.876
and he says, “Oh you must be generous” –

00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:12.210
then you can call him a hypocrite.

00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:22.793
But supposing the miserly, you see, questions himself

00:18:23.294 --> 00:18:25.918
then he is not a hypocrite.

00:18:36.918 --> 00:18:42.419
So when you put all these artificial, so-called,

00:18:42.792 --> 00:18:48.585
values upon yourself – sort of a goal –

00:18:48.835 --> 00:18:53.252
and then try to achieve that goal through your own effort,

00:18:53.627 --> 00:18:55.792
then you become that.

00:19:20.043 --> 00:19:25.544
So automatically you criticise yourself and you don’t criticise others

00:19:31.252 --> 00:19:35.460
and you know what’s wrong with you.

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:41.793
Because, what’s the use of knowing what’s wrong with others?

00:19:46.544 --> 00:19:49.711
It is like England trying to improve the conditions in India,

00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:53.294
and India trying to improve the conditions in England.

00:19:57.252 --> 00:20:00.918
But in this also human brain has an escape.

00:20:04.918 --> 00:20:08.210
When they want to criticise themselves, they find a pouch

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.335
called the left Vishuddhi and become settled there.

00:20:23.085 --> 00:20:26.168
The more cunning you are, the more clever you are,

00:20:26.419 --> 00:20:28.544
the worse is the left Vishuddhi.

00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:38.002
Then you put everything there, settled down nicely to stagnate,

00:20:38.377 --> 00:20:40.711
to get all kinds of filth in it

00:20:40.918 --> 00:20:44.210
and to be settled with yourself nicely.

00:20:56.585 --> 00:20:58.585
It’s like any lousy housewife –

00:20:58.876 --> 00:21:00.335
she takes all the dirt of the house

00:21:00.544 --> 00:21:03.377
and all that and piles up into a room, locks it up,

00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:06.043
and thinks,  oh she has been very efficient.

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:21.085
You have to face it and you have to correct it and see to it!

00:21:26.544 --> 00:21:29.502
And that’s how you become powerful.

00:21:31.502 --> 00:21:33.835
Because if your machinery is out of gear,

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:37.210
what’s the use of improving somebody else’s machinery?

00:21:42.294 --> 00:21:44.294
And when your machinery is out of gear,

00:21:44.544 --> 00:21:46.002
you put it in a lock and key,

00:21:46.252 --> 00:21:48.627
and lock it up and say, “Now it’s alright.”

00:21:56.419 --> 00:21:59.627
Or you blame somebody because of this, because of that –

00:21:59.793 --> 00:22:02.544
something else other than you.

00:22:10.793 --> 00:22:15.043
Thank God to Sahaja Yoga today that you all have got realisation,

00:22:15.252 --> 00:22:18.294
so I don’t have to do all that cleaning, you can do yourself.

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:30.252
So, in short, you become your own Guru to begin with.

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:36.627
You try to tell yourself, separate yourself from yourself

00:22:36.835 --> 00:22:41.544
and say, “Hello Sir, how are you now, come along.”

00:22:51.585 --> 00:22:54.252
But in Sahaja Yoga, you see, people

00:22:55.168 --> 00:22:59.793
suddenly assume, you see, a big sort of a ego nonsense,

00:23:00.043 --> 00:23:01.752
and they think they are big gurus,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.793
you see, big, great people, avadhutas, you see, like that.

00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:16.835
And if you ask them,

00:23:17.002 --> 00:23:19.627
they say, “Mother, Mother I loved You very much.”

00:23:29.252 --> 00:23:31.752
So they think if they love Me, then it is My duty

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.419
that I should really keep you clean.

00:23:43.043 --> 00:23:46.502
That’s not the attitude of a guru.

00:23:49.792 --> 00:23:54.627
What guru does, is to purify himself and others

00:23:54.835 --> 00:23:59.210
and give those flowers to the Deity.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.377
Till you all become gurus, I am your Guru,

00:24:09.792 --> 00:24:12.168
but once you become the guru

00:24:12.711 --> 00:24:15.335
then I become your Deity.

00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:26.918
Till they are not yet gurus, I am their Guru.

00:24:27.627 --> 00:24:29.335
Till they reach that state.

00:24:29.627 --> 00:24:33.960
Once they become the guru, then I am their Deity.

00:24:44.711 --> 00:24:49.627
Like all the Gurus, we can say Mohammad sahib –

00:24:50.002 --> 00:24:53.168
He talked of “Allah Hu Akbar.”

00:24:57.294 --> 00:24:59.918
He talked of the Holy Ghost,

00:25:01.002 --> 00:25:04.294
He talked of the resurrection,

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:07.460
because He was a Guru.

00:25:07.792 --> 00:25:12.210
And whatever He had to say, He said it with full confidence

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.043
pointing out towards the point where

00:25:15.335 --> 00:25:19.502
He looks, or where He gets His guidance from.

00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:35.960
Like Moses, like Christ also put His two fingers denoting His Father

00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:43.502
So till you become your own guru,

00:25:43.793 --> 00:25:48.502
you have to put in effort in the beginning.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.752
Then gradually you can achieve it effortlessly.

00:26:05.711 --> 00:26:09.793
Effortlessness is not to be certified,

00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:15.419
but you can verify it.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.043
A person who is discrete –

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.960
in his presence others become discrete.

00:26:30.377 --> 00:26:36.585
A person who is honest – others in his presence become honest.

00:26:41.002 --> 00:26:45.627
It is said in Sanskrit language, ‘Yatha raja tatha praja’ –

00:26:45.876 --> 00:26:49.252
‘As the king is that’s how the subjects are’.

00:26:54.876 --> 00:26:59.043
When you are the guru, you are the example.

00:27:02.043 --> 00:27:04.792
You have to be the example.

00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:09.043
Now I have seen people who are gurus, who think,

00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:12.043
call themselves gurus, in different varieties and different

00:27:12.294 --> 00:27:14.792
types of life: like professors, teachers,

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.210
you can call them, not spiritual gurus.

00:27:29.127 --> 00:27:31.585
They too, when they try

00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:35.210
to follow a mundane type of life –

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.792
not of something exceptional –

00:27:38.127 --> 00:27:42.377
then their disciples lose faith in them.

00:27:56.918 --> 00:28:00.127
Even political leaders, when they…

00:28:00.377 --> 00:28:03.918
supposing a political leader is licentious, he has weaknesses,

00:28:04.502 --> 00:28:13.043
then the people who try to follow him have no respect.

00:28:24.294 --> 00:28:27.043
So they too have to have a personal character,

00:28:27.252 --> 00:28:30.085
a personal value system.

00:28:39.252 --> 00:28:42.627
So what about the spiritual gurus then?

00:28:46.793 --> 00:28:49.918
They have to be excellent people.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:58.502
There should be no two types of life, one outside, one inside.

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:09.544
When the outside and inside becomes one, then it is effortless

00:29:19.002 --> 00:29:21.377
and that is what one has to do –

00:29:21.627 --> 00:29:27.918
the inside and the outside, one has to work it out from inside.

00:29:33.502 --> 00:29:37.168
For that you cannot bring the outside inside,

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.043
but inside has to go outside.

00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:48.544
So this is the beginning of antar yoga, the inner yoga.

00:29:52.752 --> 00:29:57.002
At the second stage you have to become thoughtless.

00:30:00.252 --> 00:30:03.792
This is very important in the West

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:08.210
because they live in thoughts – they do not have other problems

00:30:08.544 --> 00:30:10.711
of a gross nature.

00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:20.460
For example,

00:30:20.627 --> 00:30:26.960
they are brought up in such a way that they are frightened of law.

00:30:34.585 --> 00:30:37.835
They are brought up this way – they’ll keep all their carpets clean,

00:30:38.043 --> 00:30:39.585
everything clean, you see,

00:30:39.792 --> 00:30:42.835
very particular about keeping every place clean.

00:30:51.918 --> 00:30:56.335
All the gross things they keep clean,

00:31:06.127 --> 00:31:15.043
and then when they try to adjust themselves, they adjust within.

00:31:20.918 --> 00:31:23.377
Outwardly they are gentlemanly,

00:31:26.793 --> 00:31:32.419
but inside, in their thought, they are not clean.

00:31:34.502 --> 00:31:37.793
In their behaviour they are not clean, their eyes are not clean,

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:43.168
it’s poison inside.

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:47.085
And they like that poison to be taken out –

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.127
sometimes it comes out as sarcasm,

00:31:54.294 --> 00:31:59.294
it comes out as their sinister acts of aggression on other countries.

00:32:06.085 --> 00:32:09.419
They may plan out the complete destruction of the world

00:32:14.127 --> 00:32:18.210
and they don’t think there’s anything wrong in it

00:32:20.627 --> 00:32:23.419
because it is ‘an ideology’ for which, is a thought

00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:24.960
they are fighting for.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.502
As long as there is an ideology, there’s a thought,

00:32:35.752 --> 00:32:39.711
there’s some sort of a sublime talk, then they can do what they like.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.252
This filth is very sophisticated.

00:32:58.252 --> 00:33:01.210
Like the people who don’t take their baths can use some

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.627
artificial things to get a fragrance.

00:33:09.585 --> 00:33:11.876
Inside has to be clean

00:33:13.752 --> 00:33:18.792
and that’s why first the efforts are to be made to have good thoughts.

00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.043
Watch your mind –

00:33:28.918 --> 00:33:31.792
how does it think about others?

00:33:33.876 --> 00:33:38.669
I would say, racialism is one of the diseases of the same thing.

00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:48.127
I have seen people who are very well placed,

00:33:48.335 --> 00:33:50.960
sophisticated, wear immaculate dresses:

00:33:51.252 --> 00:33:57.835
when it comes to a person from a developing country,  or from say,

00:33:58.085 --> 00:34:04.043
another colour complexion, they come out with a remark,

00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:09.960
even if they are Sahaja Yogis I have seen they do it.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.210
I am saying this for the Sahaja Yogis and not for others.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:40.960
That suddenly that dead stuff, which we call as dead, becomes alive.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.252
So the mind is dirty,

00:34:53.585 --> 00:35:00.460
full of lust, greed, and anger, jealousy –

00:35:03.918 --> 00:35:08.960
and that’s why we have to be very, very careful.
Those people who have become sophisticated

00:35:09.252 --> 00:35:12.627
their weaknesses have also become sophisticated,

00:35:18.918 --> 00:35:22.335
and that’s why jealousy is a common disease.

00:35:25.585 --> 00:35:28.294
Like the other day I asked someone,

00:35:28.502 --> 00:35:31.335
“Why the father is angry with the son,

00:35:38.419 --> 00:35:41.419
and with his own brother?”

00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:43.793
So the answer was, “Because

00:35:44.127 --> 00:35:48.377
the brother is looking after the son in London.”

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:13.210
Normally any person should be thankful

00:36:13.502 --> 00:36:17.918
that: somebody is looking after my son in my absence.

00:36:23.127 --> 00:36:25.835
But the fellow is jealous

00:36:26.127 --> 00:36:29.043
because of possessiveness

00:36:29.502 --> 00:36:32.585
and the possessiveness comes out of insecurity,

00:36:35.544 --> 00:36:38.460
and insecurity comes within us

00:36:38.792 --> 00:36:41.960
because we make others insecured.

00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:53.502
There are many reasons for insecurity,  but one of them is

00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:57.793
because we are ugly and we see that ugliness in others.

00:37:10.585 --> 00:37:13.876
Now this inside filth has to be taken out

00:37:14.127 --> 00:37:17.502
with greater effort than the outside filth,

00:37:25.502 --> 00:37:28.711
and that inside filth

00:37:29.127 --> 00:37:32.377
you can watch and see within yourself.

00:37:42.792 --> 00:37:46.419
Some people try to dominate others, to tell them things –

00:37:46.669 --> 00:37:49.377
just for the bossiness of it.

00:38:01.377 --> 00:38:06.335
Now watch out – first of all, have you bossed yourself enough?

00:38:11.793 --> 00:38:15.002
Have you mastered yourself enough?

00:38:17.252 --> 00:38:22.252
Are you master of your own or you are still lacking in that?

00:38:30.252 --> 00:38:33.460
Those who have not mastered themselves want to have others,

00:38:33.752 --> 00:38:36.294
to master them.

00:38:43.835 --> 00:38:49.002
But the one who is the master of oneself, need not master anyone.

00:38:51.876 --> 00:38:54.918
He becomes the master.

00:38:55.627 --> 00:38:58.835
He doesn’t have to put in any effort, he masters.

00:39:03.627 --> 00:39:06.792
And there are so many tricks by which he can master,

00:39:11.876 --> 00:39:16.127
so many things by which he can correct.

00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:28.544
He may not say, he may not do anything, but just he manages.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.460
Everyone learns a lesson without his doing anything about it.

00:39:48.002 --> 00:39:52.585
But they know that somebody is a master of masters.

00:39:57.876 --> 00:40:00.419
Maybe, such a person will be very unassuming

00:40:00.669 --> 00:40:03.168
simple, innocent looking,

00:40:13.502 --> 00:40:18.627
but that’s Mahamaya, that’s the illusion.

00:40:19.876 --> 00:40:26.669
So, the person who is that power doesn’t want to show it outside,

00:40:35.585 --> 00:40:43.544
on the contrary, it shows in such a way that people know it.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:56.085
I mean, the way things happen in life,

00:40:56.377 --> 00:41:00.918
we start understanding that we don’t have to put up any show –

00:41:09.876 --> 00:41:14.002
someone knows everything.

00:41:16.669 --> 00:41:21.711
When we have someone like that, try to follow.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:34.585
So, in the third stage the effort should be to follow your Guru

00:41:42.502 --> 00:41:45.294
who is a Sat Guru.

00:41:49.085 --> 00:41:55.711
Now that one becomes the one…a pattern, which you have to follow.

00:41:59.835 --> 00:42:03.960
But in this also Sahaja Yogis can be very superficial.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.377
One of the Sahaja Yogis used to wear a shawl in a particular way.

00:42:13.711 --> 00:42:16.085
So, I sent him some other sahaja yogis that

00:42:16.377 --> 00:42:19.793
he will try to help them, he can be their guru;

00:42:20.585 --> 00:42:24.960
they all started wearing shawls the same way.

00:42:45.419 --> 00:42:50.168
It’s not the outside; you have to follow the inside.

00:42:52.792 --> 00:43:00.792
So when you become the guru, become the guru, you become.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:10.502
It’s such a short method – just to become.

00:43:12.585 --> 00:43:14.711
Now if you face yourself, you’ll know

00:43:14.876 --> 00:43:18.127
that there are still some steps you have to cross to become.

00:43:23.752 --> 00:43:25.960
Even now when I am lecturing to you,

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.544
you are thinking of others – “Oh, Mother is talking about him” –

00:43:29.793 --> 00:43:31.752
not about yourself.

00:43:42.585 --> 00:43:45.669
That is how one has to take it inside, the absorption

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.585
from your Guru, that you have to see yourself.

00:43:58.085 --> 00:44:01.792
Now, that is very important

00:44:02.002 --> 00:44:07.793
if we have to become the prophets who will make others prophets.

00:44:16.127 --> 00:44:22.544
Now, the higher stage is that your Guru becomes a Deity.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.502
When you say “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara“.

00:44:27.792 --> 00:44:30.627
They go up to that point but nobody says “Guru is Devi”.

00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:35.502
You can have a higher stage, than Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

00:44:51.168 --> 00:44:56.711
Because the Guru state is where you have the innocence of all these

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.711
Brahma and Mahesha and Vishnu –

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.711
their power of innocence.

00:45:15.043 --> 00:45:19.085
But then ultimately they say, “Guru Sakshat Parabrahma”.

00:45:25.603 --> 00:45:27.998
And Parabrahma is the power of the Mother

00:45:28.412 --> 00:45:32.203
Not only by becoming but now,

00:45:32.661 --> 00:45:36.203
becoming the reflector of your Deity,

00:45:44.869 --> 00:45:52.412
to develop yourself into the reflector from guru to that state.

00:46:05.869 --> 00:46:10.370
At that state you start controlling all the elements.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:22.328
That’s why all these incarnations of Adi Guru

00:46:22.661 --> 00:46:25.744
had control over elements.

00:46:30.953 --> 00:46:37.328
Brahmadeva is absolutely manifested through them.

00:46:41.328 --> 00:46:47.078
So out of Ganesha, which is the Adi Guru,

00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:50.494
He is born,

00:46:50.786 --> 00:46:55.953
or He is manifested through these three – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha –

00:47:07.328 --> 00:47:14.995
and then He comes out as Brahmadeva with four heads,

00:47:22.328 --> 00:47:28.412
three of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, and the fourth of Shri Ganesh.

00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:41.995
So Brahmadeva becomes the symbol of Guru,

00:47:45.953 --> 00:47:51.703
and as you know Ganesha is chatvari, is four –all the time.

00:47:51.995 --> 00:47:56.328
He becomes these four – in expression, in manifestation.

00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:07.744
And as you become Brahmadeva, at that stage

00:48:08.036 --> 00:48:10.911
you control all the elements.

00:48:20.412 --> 00:48:24.661
So, today I have tried to explain to you the different

00:48:24.953 --> 00:48:31.869
stages of gurupada – the state of guru.

00:48:38.869 --> 00:48:45.536
And one should understand whatever we are today,

00:48:46.869 --> 00:48:52.120
we are extremely blessed and fortunate people

00:49:00.786 --> 00:49:06.120
that, in this short time, you started from a scratch

00:49:06.494 --> 00:49:12.619
in the mud and you have become the lotuses.

00:49:21.494 --> 00:49:25.120
The lotus will invite many insects

00:49:25.869 --> 00:49:29.953
and will convert them into lotuses.

00:49:33.744 --> 00:49:35.911
madhukar they call it, madhukar,

00:49:36.203 --> 00:49:40.412
the ones who are selecting the madhu, the nectar,

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:43.078
the… what do you call? – the honey.

00:49:58.328 --> 00:50:03.078
When they get the nectar, they become themselves the lotuses.

00:50:12.412 --> 00:50:20.120
The whole dirty, filthy pond is covered with those lotus flowers.

00:50:29.453 --> 00:50:33.328
And one lotus, who is the Guru, grows higher,

00:50:36.453 --> 00:50:43.828
and then is given to the Goddess on which She resides.

00:50:52.245 --> 00:50:57.286
She resides in the heart on the platform,

00:50:57.577 --> 00:51:00.786
beautiful platform that this lotus has created.

00:51:06.245 --> 00:51:11.412
But to bear Her on your heart, you have to have a heart.

00:51:17.744 --> 00:51:21.493
There are so many qualities of a Guru, which I have told you.

00:51:21.744 --> 00:51:27.953
All the best qualities, the twelve qualities of all the sides

00:51:28.412 --> 00:51:31.869
should be completely manifested in a Guru,

00:51:38.869 --> 00:51:42.828
and the owner of those qualities is Shiva.

00:51:46.869 --> 00:51:49.453
So that is how the essence of Shiva,

00:51:49.661 --> 00:51:52.744
out of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, the Mahesha’s qualities,

00:51:52.995 --> 00:51:54.744
should shine through you.

00:52:04.828 --> 00:52:06.619
The Vishnu’s qualities of Dharma –

00:52:06.828 --> 00:52:10.661
first you have to make an effort to be dharmic, to be balanced.

00:52:19.245 --> 00:52:22.577
Then you ascend.

00:52:24.493 --> 00:52:28.412
Then you become one with the Viraata

00:52:30.828 --> 00:52:35.453
and then you can give Dharma to others.

00:52:40.286 --> 00:52:43.786
So one has to know that stage-by-stage it happens to you

00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:46.536
and you do not become a hypocrite.

00:52:53.619 --> 00:52:56.453
But you become real

00:52:59.078 --> 00:53:04.536
and the reality is shown by its own being.

00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:10.203
That is how you become.

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.744
So understand the reality within yourself, face it, solve it.

00:53:16.078 --> 00:53:18.619
But mostly, I have seen, when I tell anybody,

00:53:18.786 --> 00:53:20.203
“No, Mother I am not like that.

00:53:20.453 --> 00:53:23.661
No Mother, I didn’t say like that, that is not true!”

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.744
Some such people would like to sit in front

00:53:40.995 --> 00:53:43.245
or sort of try to show off or anything,

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:44.493
but that is not important.

00:53:44.619 --> 00:53:46.911
What is important is how much you know yourself,

00:53:47.078 --> 00:53:48.911
it is Self-realisation.

00:54:00.536 --> 00:54:05.036
Once you develop that, then you know the others in the real way

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.161
and not artificially,

00:54:12.245 --> 00:54:15.493
and then the enjoyment is complete.

00:54:17.953 --> 00:54:23.370
Like a bee will never go to an artificial flower.

00:54:26.828 --> 00:54:30.286
But human beings have to become the bee.

00:54:34.911 --> 00:54:43.493
The Guru does not need to say that he’s the Guru.

00:54:46.661 --> 00:54:50.286
Today I bless you.

00:54:55.703 --> 00:55:00.493
I have completed the twelve years of Guru’s

00:55:02.536 --> 00:55:07.286
and you should really assume the Shiva’s powers within yourself

00:55:22.412 --> 00:55:29.911
I, that is My body, My mind, My heart,

00:55:33.161 --> 00:55:38.453
everything, has spared no efforts

00:55:40.286 --> 00:55:47.577
to completely indulge into this cleansing, into this making,

00:55:47.995 --> 00:55:51.328
into this becoming of you people.

00:56:00.286 --> 00:56:08.203
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

00:56:12.412 --> 00:56:16.286
Look at yourself, help yourself

00:56:18.078 --> 00:56:24.078
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

00:56:28.328 --> 00:56:32.120
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

00:56:35.744 --> 00:56:37.619
And once you become the Guru,

00:56:37.828 --> 00:56:42.494
you become Brahmadeva , Mahesha and Vishnu.

00:56:49.494 --> 00:56:54.911
So first you are made in the pattern of Ganesha,

00:56:55.703 --> 00:56:59.036
then Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

00:57:04.453 --> 00:57:09.120
But very much depends on your readiness to do it

00:57:13.203 --> 00:57:20.370
and, most of all, your honesty and sincerity.

00:57:21.577 --> 00:57:25.370
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

00:57:28.828 --> 00:57:31.953
to understand.

00:57:32.493 --> 00:57:37.828
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

00:57:41.494 --> 00:57:46.869
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

00:57:47.661 --> 00:57:52.536
so that you proceed in your establishment.

00:58:01.036 --> 00:58:04.536
May God bless you.
