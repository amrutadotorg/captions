00:27.415 --> 00:33.346
It is such a joy to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:36.281 --> 00:43.960
of such high evolution.

00:45.041 --> 00:52.961
I'm sure all the gods and goddesses and the God Almighty Himself

00:53.161 --> 00:58.441
must be overjoyed to see this achievement, no doubt about it.

00:59.521 --> 01:04.801
But I was told that you want to know

01:05.001 --> 01:09.161
higher ways or higher things

01:09.361 --> 01:15.681
by which you would like to ascend higher and higher.

01:17.801 --> 01:21.161
In the samadhi state first is the thoughtless awareness as you know,

01:21.361 --> 01:23.960
called the Nirvichara Samadhi.

01:24.281 --> 01:30.041
And then into the other state which is called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi

01:30.241 --> 01:32.681
where it is doubtless awareness,

01:32.881 --> 01:37.641
is two stages, Savikalpa and Nirvikalpa.

01:38.041 --> 01:42.281
Most of the Sahaja Yogis now, are on the Savikalpa,

01:42.481 --> 01:45.121
not yet at the Nirvikalpa,

01:45.321 --> 01:49.321
and to rise up to the Nirvikalpa

01:49.521 --> 01:55.241
we must understand that we have to do little more about it.

01:55.921 --> 02:01.361
So far we had our physical problems, which are solved.

02:02.481 --> 02:10.281
Physical needs, comforts cannot dominate us anymore.

02:10.801 --> 02:14.721
We can live in any conditions, like Brahmapuri.

02:14.921 --> 02:19.881
We enjoy all that. That shows that we have now risen above

02:20.081 --> 02:24.561
the conditions that are laid down

02:24.761 --> 02:29.081
by the material life or the matter.

02:30.641 --> 02:32.481
That's a good state where we have reached,

02:32.681 --> 02:34.161
which is also very difficult for people.

02:34.361 --> 02:36.761
Normally, people are extremely fussy;

02:36.960 --> 02:41.361
they are worried about worldly things, worldly possessions,

02:41.561 --> 02:43.961
worldly material problems.

02:44.161 --> 02:46.121
So many of them would come and tell Me,

02:46.321 --> 02:48.521
"I haven't got this job, I haven't got that job.

02:48.721 --> 02:51.761
This is to be done, that is to be done."

02:51.960 --> 02:55.881
Then the second subtler attachment

02:56.081 --> 02:59.921
is to our emotional side,

03:00.121 --> 03:05.960
like my mother, like my brother, my sister, my wife, my children.

03:07.561 --> 03:12.201
And we go on bothering Sahaja Yoga for that,

03:12.401 --> 03:15.401
that my friend should be cured, my brother should be cured,

03:15.601 --> 03:17.681
my sister should be cured.

03:18.961 --> 03:22.361
That's a very subtle thing we do not understand,

03:22.561 --> 03:28.321
that in the realm of God those who enter can only be benefited,

03:28.521 --> 03:31.321
not those who do not enter into that.

03:31.521 --> 03:35.121
For example, if you have a relation living in India,

03:35.321 --> 03:43.321
you cannot send him the benefits

03:43.881 --> 03:47.441
of an Australian citizen. So first of all we must know

03:47.641 --> 03:50.921
that they have to be the citizens of God's realm.

03:51.121 --> 03:53.761
So unless and until we give them Realization,

03:53.961 --> 03:58.960
take them to that level, they are not entitled.

03:59.361 --> 04:04.881
So we should not have any obstinacy about it, no obstinacy.

04:05.361 --> 04:07.321
Many of you have overcome that part

04:07.521 --> 04:15.921
that you are not attached to a particular type of a relationship

04:16.121 --> 04:18.521
who are not in Sahaja Yoga.

04:18.721 --> 04:21.801
Many of you have got out of it.

04:22.001 --> 04:26.201
But then how to overcome higher attachments?

04:26.761 --> 04:29.241
Like there are attachments

04:29.441 --> 04:34.521
that "I should write a book on Sahaja Yoga"

04:34.721 --> 04:39.041
or "I should",

04:42.881 --> 04:46.481
"I should paint something for Sahaja Yoga",

04:46.681 --> 04:50.721
"I must earn for Sahaja Yoga", "I must do this for Sahaja Yoga".

04:50.921 --> 04:54.841
This is also, in a very subtle way is ego,

04:55.041 --> 04:57.801
that "I should be the leader of Sahaja Yoga".

04:58.001 --> 04:59.841
Then there are jealousies.

05:00.041 --> 05:02.761
If Mother says this is not good, you feel hurt.

05:02.961 --> 05:05.521
If Mother says this is good, you feel happy.

05:05.721 --> 05:09.641
That means you are still at a very subtler state of ego

05:09.841 --> 05:15.281
where you think, that whatever you say should be approved by Me.

05:15.681 --> 05:21.161
That is something is very subtle, and we do not understand

05:21.361 --> 05:24.201
that if Mother is not approving of it, there must be

05:24.401 --> 05:26.201
basic divine reason,

05:26.401 --> 05:29.641
otherwise why should I not approve of it?

05:30.441 --> 05:34.121
So when you have such subtler attachments also,

05:34.321 --> 05:36.561
of a higher level we should say,

05:36.761 --> 05:39.521
you must know that it's all the work of God

05:39.721 --> 05:43.321
and we are just channels in the hands of God.

05:43.801 --> 05:50.481
Now, we have a very good example, as I have told you many a times,

05:50.681 --> 05:55.041
of the little cell at the tip of the root of a tree,

05:55.241 --> 06:01.521
how it is so wise to avoid whatever is hard

06:01.721 --> 06:07.921
and to take to whatever is soft and to embed the tree into the soil.

06:08.281 --> 06:13.041
It has that innate wisdom with which we also are endowed.

06:13.241 --> 06:15.401
And we have to work it out in such a way

06:15.601 --> 06:20.001
that we do not get involved

06:20.201 --> 06:24.161
into anything which is extremely hard.

06:24.561 --> 06:27.641
Like, I would say, some people wanted to go to Tasmania.

06:27.841 --> 06:31.001
By My hint I told them, "Don't go. It won't work out.

06:31.201 --> 06:34.121
Tasmania is not a place where you can achieve anything."

06:34.321 --> 06:36.361
I knew it was impossible.

06:36.561 --> 06:39.681
But they thought they are going to do Sahaja Yoga great job,

06:39.881 --> 06:41.081
so they went there.

06:41.281 --> 06:44.241
They came back all possessed in a bad shape,

06:44.441 --> 06:47.201
and then I had to get them all right.

06:47.401 --> 06:52.601
So now you people don't misunderstand Me so much, as you used to,

06:52.801 --> 06:57.121
but still you do things which should not be done.

06:57.641 --> 07:05.161
To understand that whatever I tell you is for your ascent,

07:05.361 --> 07:07.681
you need a kind of a state of mind,

07:07.881 --> 07:11.401
a state of mind which is a detached mind.

07:11.601 --> 07:16.121
And the detachment is visible,

07:16.321 --> 07:18.961
very clear-cut in a person

07:19.161 --> 07:21.481
that he's neither very emotionally attached

07:21.681 --> 07:26.161
or he is neither, nor very physically attached

07:26.361 --> 07:30.761
but he sees that the progress

07:30.960 --> 07:35.801
of himself and of the society is the point.

07:36.001 --> 07:38.721
Like the cell,

07:38.921 --> 07:41.721
knows it has to progress for the betterment of the tree

07:41.921 --> 07:44.521
but it has innate wisdom to do it in such a way

07:44.721 --> 07:48.201
that it never harms himself

07:48.401 --> 07:54.321
or does not harm the tree.

07:54.521 --> 07:58.841
So the progress of a mind

07:59.041 --> 08:01.881
which wants to develop, has to be such

08:02.081 --> 08:06.401
that you should move with a balance, with a witness state,

08:06.601 --> 08:10.201
and see for yourself how far you should go

08:10.401 --> 08:15.681
and how far you should not go.

08:18.641 --> 08:23.761
Going to extremes is not Sahaja Yoga style. Ascent is.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.641
So even if you find somewhere,

08:27.841 --> 08:32.681
you go and find that there is no response,

08:32.881 --> 08:35.801
then you must know that it is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga,

08:36.001 --> 08:40.961
nothing wrong with you, but perhaps

08:41.161 --> 08:43.121
you have not approached the right place

08:43.321 --> 08:45.521
or you have not approached the right way,

08:45.721 --> 08:48.161
you have not done the way it should have been.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.201
So change your style.

08:50.401 --> 08:54.041
In Sahaja Yoga we have to go on changing our directions

08:54.241 --> 08:56.441
according to the need of the hour.

08:56.721 --> 09:00.201
You are not fixed quantity, rigid quantity

09:00.521 --> 09:03.601
Most of the people think that we are so rigid

09:03.801 --> 09:08.841
that we cannot move this side or that side.

09:09.881 --> 09:17.001
The mobility of our movement is so great,

09:17.201 --> 09:20.001
I say 360 degrees.

09:20.401 --> 09:25.401
Because you are stationed in the center in your Spirit.

09:25.881 --> 09:27.961
You can move anyway you like

09:28.161 --> 09:30.641
as long as you are centered in your Spirit.

09:30.841 --> 09:33.001
But this is an important point which we miss

09:33.201 --> 09:35.921
that we are centered in our Spirit.

09:36.121 --> 09:38.481
And whatever movement we do,

09:38.681 --> 09:41.761
as long as we are centered in the Spirit,

09:41.961 --> 09:48.161
is necessary for our growth and for the growth of the collective.

09:49.201 --> 09:52.321
Now let us see certain emotional sides we have,

09:52.521 --> 09:55.161
how we can conquer. It's very simple is.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.081
You are very fortunate, I should say, in a way,

09:57.281 --> 10:00.361
than any other seeker so far

10:00.561 --> 10:03.960
because you have before Me Myself sitting.

10:04.241 --> 10:06.521
I am sitting before Myself and I see Myself

10:06.721 --> 10:11.281
as a good example of following.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.960
When you have someone like that, it's very simple to see.

10:18.841 --> 10:22.481
People didn't have any such people or some leaders

10:22.681 --> 10:26.041
or somebody who was an ideal.

10:26.241 --> 10:28.641
So, it was all right that they went wrong.

10:28.841 --> 10:34.081
But those who have something before them, that's very simple.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.401
The secret is like this,

10:39.601 --> 10:44.841
now when you are subtly attached to something,

10:45.041 --> 10:49.921
so to say an emotional side of something

10:50.121 --> 10:53.561
or you always like to be on the negative side

10:53.761 --> 10:56.281
or too much of a positive side

10:56.481 --> 10:59.960
in the sense that you aggress others,

11:00.641 --> 11:05.361
then you must discriminate.

11:06.481 --> 11:10.401
If it is an aggressiveness that you see in yourself,

11:10.601 --> 11:13.801
witness within yourself, then you aggress yourself.

11:14.001 --> 11:16.361
That is the best way to get rid of it.

11:16.721 --> 11:18.001
If you are a hot-tempered person,

11:18.201 --> 11:21.241
better get angry with yourself at least ten times

11:21.441 --> 11:24.921
and then you will see that your temper will mellow down,

11:25.121 --> 11:29.201
because all that is coming out will be directed towards yourself.

11:29.641 --> 11:31.441
Now this is the discrimination you have to use

11:31.641 --> 11:33.601
and be honest about it.

11:33.801 --> 11:38.081
The another side could be that you are very left-sided, emotional,

11:38.281 --> 11:41.960
extremely emotional about things and you cannot get over.

11:42.401 --> 11:47.241
Then that's the best. Divert your emotions to Me,

11:47.441 --> 11:51.401
put your emotions to Me, but do not aggress Me.

11:51.801 --> 11:53.761
This is the discretion you have to use.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.761
When you have aggression, you aggress yourself

11:56.961 --> 12:00.721
and when you have emotional attachments, direct it.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.321
It's very simple to do.

12:02.521 --> 12:07.401
What pleases Mother? Very simple things. What does it please Her?

12:07.641 --> 12:11.361
Very simple things pleases Her, like flowers.

12:11.681 --> 12:15.281
Now people say that, "We were going in the garden, Mother.

12:15.481 --> 12:18.841
We found these flowers for You." Is good idea.

12:19.041 --> 12:21.001
But how much attention you have put to it

12:21.201 --> 12:23.681
that we have to give a flower to Mother.

12:23.921 --> 12:27.881
Now what flowers She likes? She likes fragrant flowers. All right.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.960
From where should we get the fragrant flower? It's very simple.

12:32.281 --> 12:35.641
It's a shop. When you are going around, be on the look-out.

12:35.841 --> 12:38.561
There must be some shop with fragrant flowers.

12:38.761 --> 12:40.681
In those months what flowers come in?

12:40.881 --> 12:42.681
What flower am I going to give to Mother?

12:42.881 --> 12:44.321
The whole direction changes.

12:44.521 --> 12:47.161
You see, you become so beautifully attached to Me,

12:47.361 --> 12:49.041
and I have to gain nothing out of it

12:49.241 --> 12:52.241
but by attaching yourself to Me, you gain something.

12:52.441 --> 12:54.401
Like the river Ganges flows,

12:54.601 --> 12:56.561
and if you dip in the River Ganges,

12:56.761 --> 12:58.601
the poor river Ganges doesn't get anything

12:58.801 --> 13:01.721
but you get the blessings of river Ganges.

13:01.921 --> 13:04.681
In the same way you have to think

13:04.881 --> 13:09.001
that if we have to attach ourselves to Mother,

13:09.201 --> 13:12.681
we must put our attention completely, entirely to it.

13:12.881 --> 13:17.201
Little, little things you do. What should I do for my Mother?

13:17.401 --> 13:20.641
How should I please? Is not what you give Me is important.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.241
It is how much heart you put into it.

13:23.481 --> 13:28.121
You know the story of Shabari. She was a very simple woman,

13:28.321 --> 13:31.721
an old lady with very few teeth.

13:31.921 --> 13:34.721
When Rama was coming she said, "What should I give to Shri Ram?"

13:34.921 --> 13:38.921
All right, she went round and round. There were, in the forest,

13:39.121 --> 13:44.841
some small little what we call berries, ber, and she thought,

13:45.041 --> 13:48.681
"It may not be sweet for my Rama. How will I give Him?"

13:48.881 --> 13:51.881
So she picked them up. She used to test it with her teeth.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.641
One tooth she used to pierce in it and see if it is sweet.

13:55.881 --> 13:58.441
And then she would collect those

13:58.641 --> 14:02.241
and those who were bad she threw away.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.641
When Shri Ram came, she said,

14:04.841 --> 14:07.881
"Shri Ram, I couldn't get anything but these for You.

14:08.081 --> 14:13.961
Will you have it?" Now, Shri Rama, being an incarnation,

14:14.161 --> 14:19.041
knew the depth of the love of this lady. He took it up in His hand.

14:19.241 --> 14:24.921
He knew that this is given by great love of a great heart.

14:25.481 --> 14:30.121
So she says, "This I have tasted each one of them.

14:30.321 --> 14:33.561
Don't have any doubts. I have tasted in every one of them.

14:33.761 --> 14:36.841
They are all very sweet. You can have them."

14:37.401 --> 14:40.921
So He puts it in the mouth, tells His wife,

14:41.121 --> 14:44.641
"I have never eaten such beautiful fruits such great fruits before."

14:44.841 --> 14:47.681
I mean, it's such a simple fruit, you see.

14:48.001 --> 14:51.361
Sitaji, His wife, being an incarnation Herself, She said,

14:51.561 --> 14:53.921
"You must give Me some. After all, I am your Ardhangini" -

14:54.121 --> 14:57.361
is the half, better half.

14:58.441 --> 15:01.041
But Lakshmana was getting angry.

15:01.241 --> 15:04.961
He said," Who is this old woman sitting here and giving such ..."

15:05.161 --> 15:08.481
We don't eat things, you see, eaten by others; we call it tustha,

15:08.681 --> 15:11.321
is a uthistha, means if the one who has eaten something

15:11.521 --> 15:13.601
is never given. And to Rama.

15:13.801 --> 15:17.521
So he was very angry, fuming with temper.

15:17.721 --> 15:20.761
So She takes it in Her hand and She tells Her brother-in-law,

15:20.960 --> 15:23.601
"Oh, this is the best I've had, my brother-in-law.

15:23.801 --> 15:26.321
I've never had such beautiful fruits."

15:26.761 --> 15:31.361
Now he gets tempted and he says, "Really?

15:31.960 --> 15:36.081
Can I have some?" She said, "No it's only for Me and My husband.

15:36.481 --> 15:38.921
You better ask her." So He asks Shabari,

15:39.121 --> 15:41.921
"Can you give Me some, please?"

15:42.121 --> 15:46.641
The whole temper fizzles out and then He sees

15:47.201 --> 15:51.961
the beauty of that fruit because it is done with love.

15:52.641 --> 15:58.001
So this is what it is. Love which you have should be expanded.

15:58.521 --> 16:01.561
And very simple. If you are attached to Me I am a person

16:01.761 --> 16:07.361
who is so much spread out, all over. It goes into the whole,

16:07.641 --> 16:13.241
it goes into the nature, it permeates everywhere.

16:13.441 --> 16:17.761
Whatever love you give Me is not like a drop in a ocean

16:17.960 --> 16:21.041
but is this ocean in a drop.

16:21.241 --> 16:24.561
And that is what we must understand how to love Mother.

16:24.761 --> 16:27.761
But when you love Me, you won't feel bad if I tell you something,

16:27.960 --> 16:30.921
"This is not good for you, you should all not have done it,"

16:31.121 --> 16:34.241
because if you want to be all right, you would say,

16:34.441 --> 16:38.281
"All right, Mother, this was wrong. All right, I am sorry.

16:38.481 --> 16:40.561
I'll never do this again."

16:40.761 --> 16:44.561
This is a very simple way but it is a very difficult thing

16:44.761 --> 16:47.161
for a human being. Is so simple.

16:47.361 --> 16:51.960
I asked Warren that "Are they prepared to take up what I say?"

16:52.481 --> 16:56.601
Then you will be surprised, when we are in love with someone,

16:56.801 --> 16:59.801
we don't mind how we cross the roads, how we go there,

17:00.001 --> 17:02.681
how we have to cross floods, this, that.

17:02.881 --> 17:06.881
That force of love takes us there. In the same way,

17:07.081 --> 17:09.401
the force of love for water,

17:09.601 --> 17:12.721
for the whole tree, takes that little root - that innate wisdom

17:12.921 --> 17:16.441
is nothing but the love he has for the whole tree -

17:16.641 --> 17:21.401
that he goes to the water, sucks it in for that great tree.

17:22.001 --> 17:24.881
It's not that it is important for the tree.

17:25.081 --> 17:28.401
If there is no one tree, one root, doesn't matter.

17:28.601 --> 17:34.601
But it is the wholesomeness of existence

17:34.801 --> 17:38.761
that one feels when we become one with the whole.

17:38.961 --> 17:40.801
And this wholesomeness is to be felt

17:41.001 --> 17:42.921
and that's the greatest enjoyment.

17:43.121 --> 17:45.801
The wholesomeness is to be felt within yourself.

17:46.001 --> 17:48.681
Is the greatest enjoyment, and that is how

17:48.881 --> 17:50.841
we progress higher and higher.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.441
So the Savikalpa is this that we are still busy

17:53.641 --> 17:55.841
with our relationships.

17:56.041 --> 17:59.801
We, we notice that Mother has married us,

18:00.001 --> 18:03.921
given us good husbands, good wives. We are very happily married

18:04.121 --> 18:08.801
and we are enjoying our married life and we are looking forward

18:09.001 --> 18:12.041
to greater marriages and better marriages.

18:12.241 --> 18:15.281
But that's not the end of it, not at all.

18:15.481 --> 18:18.521
This is just the beginning, just the start

18:18.721 --> 18:21.681
and after this has happened,

18:21.881 --> 18:25.041
if you get attached too much to it, then you have lost the point,

18:25.241 --> 18:28.881
lost the point. The marriage has taken place.

18:29.081 --> 18:32.401
Like an electricity, you see,

18:32.601 --> 18:35.561
if you plug it to the mains,

18:35.761 --> 18:40.961
it is not for getting attached to oneself,

18:41.161 --> 18:45.081
but it is for the use of that instrument.

18:45.361 --> 18:48.801
So the marriage is an instrument which is to be used,

18:49.241 --> 18:53.121
which is to be completely understood

18:53.321 --> 18:55.481
for the purpose of enlightening others.

18:55.681 --> 19:03.721
So first thing is that Sahaja Yoga is our aim,

19:03.921 --> 19:08.641
is our dharma, is our being.

19:08.841 --> 19:12.281
That is the main thing. All the rest of the things come later.

19:12.521 --> 19:15.361
Supposing then, you find your wife or your husband

19:15.561 --> 19:18.121
are getting materialistic, better to depart.

19:18.321 --> 19:22.001
Tell them, "No, we cannot." See, for Me this is important.

19:22.201 --> 19:26.601
Marriage was just a means to an end. But the end is different.

19:26.801 --> 19:29.401
So we can give up this means, we'll have another means.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.041
And this is to be understood in its true color.

19:32.241 --> 19:35.401
If your marriage doesn't give you progress in your spiritual life,

19:35.601 --> 19:37.241
better to give it up.

19:37.481 --> 19:40.721
And that's what I have been telling everyone about it,

19:40.921 --> 19:44.001
how to get over your emotional problem.

19:45.961 --> 19:49.001
Some people have aggressiveness in them.

19:49.201 --> 19:52.121
Now when they are aggressive

19:52.321 --> 19:55.441
then what happens that some people ...

19:55.641 --> 20:00.960
I told you you'll get breeze; you are getting the breeze, all right.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.641
And look at the shade.

20:07.201 --> 20:12.401
You see how the nature, how the nature acts, how the nature helps.

20:12.681 --> 20:17.161
Just look at the nature, how subservient it is. It enjoys that way.

20:17.401 --> 20:19.281
You must have heard about what happened in Perth,

20:19.481 --> 20:21.081
what happened everywhere.

20:21.281 --> 20:25.281
See, the nature is so subservient. Why? What is the need?

20:25.521 --> 20:30.921
Because it gets the blessings. It gets the beauty of wholesomeness,

20:31.121 --> 20:34.521
of doing something for the whole. This is the wholesomeness.

20:34.721 --> 20:38.001
The wholesomeness of the whole job is to be understood

20:38.201 --> 20:41.721
and when it is understood, then only you realize

20:41.921 --> 20:44.201
the beauty of you being Sahaja yogis.

20:44.401 --> 20:48.241
Otherwise you just, for a limited thing, ”I got married,

20:48.441 --> 20:50.921
I am much better, I got rid of my bad habits".

20:51.121 --> 20:53.721
That's not sufficient.

20:53.921 --> 20:57.561
The quality of wholesomeness, when is experienced within ourselves,

20:57.761 --> 21:00.121
then only that joy comes in.

21:00.521 --> 21:03.121
So we go up to a point and then we recede.

21:03.321 --> 21:07.121
Like the sea, it goes up to a point and then recedes.

21:07.441 --> 21:10.121
It does not go beyond a certain point.

21:10.321 --> 21:13.241
It has its own maryadas. It knows how far to go.

21:13.441 --> 21:17.441
But what does it do? It ascends as clouds.

21:17.721 --> 21:22.361
It purifies itself, ascends as clouds and then meets

21:22.801 --> 21:25.521
the Himalayas and then you get the rain

21:25.721 --> 21:29.081
for the benefit all the others. It's a big circle that is made

21:29.281 --> 21:33.161
and the wholesomeness of that circle is realized by the sea.

21:33.361 --> 21:35.201
In the same way, you must know that

21:35.401 --> 21:38.361
you are in that great circle of nature

21:38.561 --> 21:42.041
where you have to play your own part in a full way,

21:42.241 --> 21:44.321
and once you realize that mentally,

21:44.521 --> 21:47.161
you should put it in your heart, the way I've said it.

21:47.361 --> 21:50.721
Because to put it in the heart for some people is very difficult.

21:50.921 --> 21:52.801
Like, they'll do My Puja, all right,

21:53.001 --> 21:57.481
is mechanically, but some people may not even do any Puja,

21:57.681 --> 22:02.481
they sit before the photograph and talk to Me heart-to-heart,

22:02.681 --> 22:04.521
without saying anything.

22:04.721 --> 22:07.241
And even in puja, when I see people doing Puja,

22:07.441 --> 22:11.681
I know how far they are dedicated because the way they do it

22:11.881 --> 22:16.641
with caution, with care, with awe, with understanding.

22:16.841 --> 22:19.361
Everything is so beautiful. But if somebody is doing

22:19.561 --> 22:23.241
just a ritual thing, I get a fright. I just don't understand.

22:23.441 --> 22:27.481
Now next time he might hit My Foot or something like that.

22:27.681 --> 22:33.961
So one has to be all the time ascending.

22:34.161 --> 22:38.161
Ascent has to be achieved and that ascent is only possible

22:38.361 --> 22:41.361
when we start giving up all these ties and tags that we have.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.841
These ties and tags keep us down.

22:44.041 --> 22:47.041
So get over the ties and tags.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.801
The other day I was telling Warren that, you see,

22:50.001 --> 22:53.681
men and women after forty-five or fifty

22:53.921 --> 22:56.721
still go on thinking of marriages. It is too much.

22:56.921 --> 22:59.641
It's all right. After forty also one should be all right

22:59.841 --> 23:01.921
but at least forty-five, fifty.

23:02.121 --> 23:03.841
But even at sixty years somebody comes and says,

23:04.041 --> 23:06.561
"Mother, get me married." Then I really get fed up.

23:06.761 --> 23:11.081
As if My job is to get you married, like a clergyman.

23:11.281 --> 23:13.761
So this is not the way. What is in a marriage?

23:13.961 --> 23:16.601
Some people are seeking their husbands all their lives.

23:16.801 --> 23:21.761
When are you going to seek the real one that is your Spirit?

23:21.960 --> 23:24.881
So that category of people have to come up

23:25.081 --> 23:27.121
and work it out in that manner.

23:27.321 --> 23:31.201
Then only our family, our relationships,

23:31.401 --> 23:35.601
our society will have some meaning in the realm of God.

23:35.801 --> 23:41.081
Otherwise, it has no meaning. We have to be meaningful to Him,

23:41.281 --> 23:43.441
not that He should be meaningful to us.

23:43.641 --> 23:45.401
We should change our attitude towards Him,

23:45.601 --> 23:47.801
that "What has God done for us? Let's see."

23:48.001 --> 23:50.561
We should say, "What have we done for God?

23:50.761 --> 23:53.121
What have we done for God?"

23:53.321 --> 23:56.481
Then you will get ideas, what is to be done, how to spread out,

23:56.681 --> 23:59.201
how to go ahead, how to work it out.

23:59.401 --> 24:02.081
But still there are limitations, I know.

24:02.281 --> 24:03.921
Some people have limitations.

24:04.121 --> 24:06.561
They have limitations because they have a background.

24:06.761 --> 24:10.121
Some of them come from countries which has a background.

24:10.401 --> 24:13.281
And also the other one is that

24:13.481 --> 24:17.121
the problem of these people, delimiting others.

24:17.321 --> 24:20.081
When they come in contact with you, they try to delimit,

24:20.281 --> 24:26.001
by their talks, by their, I should say,

24:26.201 --> 24:29.441
talks without understanding what they mean,

24:29.641 --> 24:33.001
some sort of frivolous, sarcastic things.

24:33.361 --> 24:37.121
And people get impressed by such people. And if you get impressed

24:37.321 --> 24:39.841
then you should know you are not a Sahaja yogi.

24:40.041 --> 24:42.681
A Sahaja yogi is to be known by his character,

24:42.881 --> 24:48.161
by his righteousness, by his behavior.

24:48.601 --> 24:50.521
The behavior of a Sahaja yogi should be

24:50.721 --> 24:55.241
extremely a peaceful behavior, peaceful.

24:56.081 --> 25:01.001
Sahaja Yogis who are just rushing up and down, upset,

25:01.281 --> 25:03.001
are not Sahaja Yogis.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.841
Peaceful. Now how do you get your peace?

25:06.121 --> 25:08.321
Peace comes from your Spirit.

25:08.521 --> 25:10.641
Because you know you are in your Spirit.

25:10.841 --> 25:14.921
You know that you are one with God Almighty.

25:15.121 --> 25:16.881
What is there to hurry?

25:17.081 --> 25:20.721
Where is He going and where are you going? You are together.

25:20.921 --> 25:22.841
Whatever is there, you are there.

25:23.041 --> 25:26.041
So what is there to hurry? What is there to just

25:26.241 --> 25:29.761
hasten something or get upset?

25:29.960 --> 25:33.241
Peaceful personality comes when you say, "No, not this."

25:33.441 --> 25:35.921
When, when the haste start, then you should say,

25:36.121 --> 25:39.921
"Not this, not this, not this."

25:40.521 --> 25:43.441
Another could be that when you see somebody

25:43.641 --> 25:46.281
whom you don't like or who has been harsh to you,

25:46.481 --> 25:51.281
who has been cruel to you, you get annoyed.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.881
And then again you will get disturbed.

25:54.081 --> 25:58.441
At that time: "I forgive. I forgive. I forgive."

25:59.481 --> 26:03.441
Main thing is, you have to be peaceful. Not that some people say

26:03.641 --> 26:06.881
that "Mother, I try to forgive. It's difficult to forgive."

26:07.081 --> 26:11.001
It's all mythical you know that very well. But what you have to say:

26:11.201 --> 26:14.681
"I forgive. I forgive. I forgive," if there's disturbance.

26:14.881 --> 26:20.081
Mine is another case. Supposing I see somebody who is a rakshasa,

26:20.441 --> 26:24.801
then, you see, a kind of a thing builds in Me, which I don't know

26:25.001 --> 26:27.921
what you should call in human words, but we can say

26:28.121 --> 26:33.921
anti-forces against that person, like tremendous vibrations.

26:34.121 --> 26:37.481
And when they are released, you see, they engulf that rakshasa.

26:37.681 --> 26:41.081
He goes down in his own estimation, in the estimation of others.

26:41.281 --> 26:43.681
Somehow or other, he gets destroyed.

26:43.881 --> 26:48.281
In a modern way, he is not killed but in a way he is killed.

26:48.521 --> 26:51.641
So this is what happens but that may not be with you.

26:51.841 --> 26:55.641
So, what you have to do when you start feeling anything

26:55.841 --> 27:00.561
anger against, say, some very devilish guru, supposing,

27:00.761 --> 27:05.521
then you build it up in yourself and that built-up anger within you

27:05.721 --> 27:08.601
will neutralize that fellow. You need not say it out.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.881
You need not talk about it, but that built-up anger

27:11.081 --> 27:14.321
will little bit trouble you also because it has a little reaction.

27:14.521 --> 27:17.561
but when it is released it will have an effect

27:17.761 --> 27:22.681
and such a person cannot stand a Sahaja yogi.

27:22.921 --> 27:24.721
You see, there are so many things that happen,

27:24.921 --> 27:26.961
automatically they'll happen.

27:27.161 --> 27:29.841
As you know that I had told people that

27:30.041 --> 27:33.721
”Don't bring Rajneesh people to Me". But they wouldn't listen to Me.

27:34.201 --> 27:38.241
They brought three people in a program. And three of them collapsed,

27:38.441 --> 27:43.001
collapsed just like a big boulder,

27:43.201 --> 27:45.121
and I didn't know what to do with them.

27:45.321 --> 27:49.881
So they were really literally taken off

27:50.081 --> 27:52.841
as you would take out a big stone.

27:53.041 --> 27:58.521
So, in that case I didn't get angry. I didn't do anything,

27:58.721 --> 28:03.201
but as soon as they came the built-up force within Me

28:03.401 --> 28:07.081
just froze them completely. I didn't do anything.

28:07.281 --> 28:09.681
On the contrary, it was disturbing our program

28:09.881 --> 28:14.081
but the built-up force could not wait; it just froze them.

28:14.521 --> 28:16.961
So this is what is the other side of it,

28:17.161 --> 28:21.401
that even if you hate any guru, you don't like him

28:21.601 --> 28:24.121
because he has been so unkind, build up that force.

28:24.321 --> 28:27.961
For that you need strength, because it's painful little bit.

28:28.161 --> 28:31.761
Build up that strength within you, to hold that sword in your hand.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.081
Then you get the sword and then you cut him off,

28:34.281 --> 28:37.161
without doing anything. He is just cut off.

28:37.441 --> 28:39.921
So going to that limit where we find

28:40.121 --> 28:43.281
that some people are so sinful,

28:43.481 --> 28:49.041
so horrid, so devilish that they should be punished, no doubt.

28:49.241 --> 28:52.761
But for that you don't punish. Let the Divine do it.

28:52.961 --> 28:55.761
But your force built-in within yourself can do it.

28:55.961 --> 28:57.841
You should try all these things within yourself

28:58.041 --> 28:59.921
and see it works out.

29:00.121 --> 29:03.641
Now, for meditating, many people think that,

29:03.841 --> 29:08.761
four o'clock get up, do this, this that, and it's very difficult.

29:09.201 --> 29:12.041
In the beginning. There's no need for you to get up

29:12.241 --> 29:15.801
four o'clock otherwise, but in the beginning it is necessary.

29:16.001 --> 29:18.001
Because - why I say, get up four o'clock -

29:18.201 --> 29:21.401
you are such, such slaves to your sleep

29:21.681 --> 29:23.801
because you sleep such a lot.

29:24.001 --> 29:25.921
Early in the morning you sleep such a lot.

29:26.121 --> 29:30.001
So just to overcome that habit of yours

29:30.361 --> 29:34.161
of sleeping, of sloth, you should be able to get up anytime

29:34.361 --> 29:37.121
that you have to get up because we are on war.

29:37.361 --> 29:40.521
We are on war path. Which time is free for us?

29:40.721 --> 29:43.841
Anytime, whether I sleep or I am awake, I am fighting.

29:44.041 --> 29:48.161
I don't find even a single minute that I am not working.

29:48.561 --> 29:53.561
So this is what it is. You have to get up in the morning

29:53.761 --> 29:57.921
because you have to train your body, "Better behave yourself."

29:58.641 --> 30:02.801
Supposing your body cannot sleep on the ground,

30:03.281 --> 30:05.561
make your body sleep. Let's see what happens.

30:05.761 --> 30:07.961
This is a tapasya. This is the penance

30:08.161 --> 30:09.961
through which the Sahaja yogis have to go

30:10.161 --> 30:13.481
that they make their body their slaves in the sense that

30:13.681 --> 30:16.841
they can use that body. That doesn't mean tomorrow I want you

30:17.041 --> 30:20.201
to be sitting on the bed of thorns

30:20.401 --> 30:23.441
and I have to always take the extreme side to which you people go.

30:23.641 --> 30:26.321
But if your body tries to be funny, better tell the body,

30:26.521 --> 30:29.521
"You behave yourself. What do you mean? Why can't you do this?

30:29.721 --> 30:32.161
Why can't you do that?"

30:32.481 --> 30:35.361
There are so many habits we have, which we should avoid.

30:35.561 --> 30:40.321
Some people have habits of coming forward too much all the time,

30:40.521 --> 30:44.241
to be in the public to be there all the time, this, that.

30:44.441 --> 30:48.001
Tell yourself, "There's no need." If you are called, you better go.

30:48.481 --> 30:50.801
Detach yourself from yourself and see for yourself.

30:51.001 --> 30:54.481
As I said, I see Myself sitting before Myself.

30:54.681 --> 30:58.241
In the same way, you see yourself sitting before you

30:58.441 --> 30:59.961
and you tell yourself very clearly,

31:00.161 --> 31:02.841
"Now, this is not the way it is to be done.

31:03.721 --> 31:05.401
This is not the way. This is not Sahaja."

31:05.601 --> 31:07.921
Why are you going forward all the time?

31:08.121 --> 31:10.721
Why are you trying to show off?" Better rebuke yourself.

31:10.921 --> 31:13.161
This is what I said, aggression to yourself.

31:13.361 --> 31:16.881
And tell yourself that you have to be like a Sahaja yogi.

31:17.081 --> 31:19.761
Sometimes I find people laugh at wrong times,

31:19.961 --> 31:21.601
they cry at wrong times,

31:21.801 --> 31:23.561
they do things at wrong times.

31:23.761 --> 31:26.561
It's done, is done. Don't worry about that, but next time ...

31:26.761 --> 31:29.601
Why did I do it? All right, next time I am not going to do this one.

31:29.801 --> 31:32.281
This I did because I wanted to show off

31:32.481 --> 31:36.281
or I was emotionally disturbed at the wrong time."

31:36.521 --> 31:42.721
But the expression of love is very spontaneous.

31:42.921 --> 31:45.881
But that spontaneity to come you must get rid of your habits.

31:46.081 --> 31:48.721
Otherwise you can never become spontaneous.

31:48.921 --> 31:51.921
A person who has got habits cannot.

31:52.121 --> 31:53.641
The other day I was giving a lecture

31:53.841 --> 31:56.201
and one fellow got up and went out

31:56.401 --> 32:00.841
while just meditating, because he wanted to smoke.

32:01.921 --> 32:05.641
So you can imagine, because of habits how we sacrifice

32:05.841 --> 32:09.881
something that is so important, something so auspicious.

32:10.201 --> 32:14.681
You can realize it that your habits within yourself are built-in

32:14.881 --> 32:18.361
because there was no tradition of dharma also.

32:18.641 --> 32:21.201
If there's a tradition of dharma, then what happens,

32:21.401 --> 32:24.161
as I told the other day, explained to them,

32:24.361 --> 32:31.841
that the fat cells in our stomach get the experiencer,

32:32.041 --> 32:35.361
charmed, with the sense of virtue,

32:35.561 --> 32:38.761
righteousness, of goodness, of innocence.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.641
But if that is not so, it's like a dead ...

32:41.841 --> 32:43.441
another cell going in the head

32:43.641 --> 32:47.281
and experienced in dirty things, in doing dirty things,

32:47.481 --> 32:50.401
in doing something that is destructive.

32:50.601 --> 32:53.321
All these modern methods are destructive.

32:53.521 --> 32:55.721
And then you get only the sensation from that

32:55.921 --> 32:58.761
because it's a dead stuff, it needs a sensation all the time,

32:58.961 --> 33:00.761
and they start doing all these things.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.681
But now with the Kundalini awakening your dharma is built in.

33:04.881 --> 33:09.481
Your cells are charmed by that.

33:09.681 --> 33:14.721
So you use that power to enlighten your brain

33:14.921 --> 33:19.601
which surrounds actually, as auras over the heart.

33:19.801 --> 33:21.961
It's such a mutual understanding between the two

33:22.161 --> 33:25.960
but you have to establish that mutual understanding.

33:26.281 --> 33:31.641
Our idea is that

33:31.841 --> 33:34.761
by God's grace we are so many,

33:34.961 --> 33:37.321
and if we want, we can transform the world.

33:37.521 --> 33:41.561
We can bring peace, joy and bliss to this world.

33:41.761 --> 33:47.601
We could be blissful if we count our blessings.

33:47.801 --> 33:54.761
And you'll be joyous if you get rid of your tags.

33:54.960 --> 33:59.601
We'll have to fly, then only we can be joyous.

33:59.881 --> 34:03.601
And for this we have to have our balance, our ascent

34:03.801 --> 34:09.921
and then the desire to fly into the whole universe.

34:12.441 --> 34:15.761
How to do it, you can find out yourself. It's not difficult.

34:15.960 --> 34:19.241
How can I do it? Face yourself, find out about yourself.

34:19.441 --> 34:22.361
Don't justify yourself. Don't be miserable.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.441
Some people identify themselves with miseries

34:24.641 --> 34:26.161
and like to enjoy their miseries.

34:26.361 --> 34:28.561
Stupid things these are, absolutely.

34:28.761 --> 34:32.241
Such miserable looking people have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

34:32.481 --> 34:38.241
So, you have to be joyous, happy, balanced, well-behaved, sober.

34:38.521 --> 34:41.361
Outwardly it will show whatever is inward.

34:41.561 --> 34:44.041
All your dignity will express, if there's dignity.

34:44.241 --> 34:48.681
See if you just have a dignity outside, it will drop out in no time.

34:48.881 --> 34:54.761
So all these things can be built from inside out, not outside in.

34:54.961 --> 35:01.081
And once they are built outside also, then they are best.

35:01.281 --> 35:05.761
But outside, what we have to do is to put ourselves outside,

35:05.960 --> 35:09.761
that's all. "Now Nirmala is sitting there. I am sitting here.

35:09.961 --> 35:14.401
Now Nirmala tells Me, then I tell Nirmala.

35:14.681 --> 35:17.681
"Let's work it out that way. And when we work it out,

35:17.881 --> 35:21.761
then things will be very easy because now you have

35:21.961 --> 35:25.041
a state where you are separated from yourself.

35:25.241 --> 35:27.401
So that is the state of Nirvikalpa

35:27.601 --> 35:31.161
where you are not attached to anything.

35:31.361 --> 35:34.401
You don't have any habits, you are not attached to anything,

35:34.601 --> 35:36.361
you have no diseases, you have no troubles,

35:36.561 --> 35:40.361
you are above everything. You do not try to

35:40.561 --> 35:44.801
complicate things for Me. You do not try to say things more than Me.

35:45.001 --> 35:48.721
You just take it a hint, sufficient, "Mother said so. All right."

35:48.921 --> 35:51.001
But some people have another bad habit,

35:51.201 --> 35:53.441
"Mother said so. So this is so."

35:53.641 --> 35:57.361
Use your discretion. How can Mother say? If She has said something,

35:57.561 --> 36:00.241
there must be something in it, must understand.

36:00.441 --> 36:03.641
Like Warren asked Me, "Mother, should I marry?"

36:03.841 --> 36:06.001
I was stunned, you know, I was stunned.

36:06.201 --> 36:08.241
But I didn't know how to tell him or ...

36:08.441 --> 36:11.841
I said, "As long as you think you'll be happy, it's all right."

36:12.041 --> 36:14.721
I mean any person, at that time who was not so mad,

36:14.921 --> 36:18.481
could have seen the point, but that time he wouldn't understand.

36:18.681 --> 36:21.161
In the same way, with everyone it happens

36:21.361 --> 36:24.281
that when I tell you something, you don't understand.

36:24.761 --> 36:26.961
Most of the marriages have failed where you have said,

36:27.161 --> 36:30.361
"I want to marry someone," ninety-nine point nine.

36:30.561 --> 36:33.441
When I have said you marry someone

36:33.641 --> 36:36.321
because you have been living with that person, something,

36:36.521 --> 36:38.841
such marriages also have failed, I have seen.

36:39.041 --> 36:41.961
But mostly the marriages we have chosen do not fail

36:42.161 --> 36:45.001
because there's a divine hand. It's all planned out.

36:45.201 --> 36:47.960
May God bless you all.
