00:15:56.366 --> 00:16:01.696
Today, we are going to worship the Goddess.

00:16:01.696 --> 00:16:13.956
That’s the, first the left side programming
is with Her, but later on, at Sahastrara,

00:16:13.956 --> 00:16:16.796
She’s the Adi Shakti.

00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:23.156
And, on the left side, whatever She does is
already written, as you must have seen, because

00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:45.226
She’s the memory and She’s the wisdom
and, that She protects you, is shown when

00:16:45.226 --> 00:16:52.515
She uses Her power over the Ganas.

00:16:52.515 --> 00:17:08.516
There are Ganas that are, as we know, responsible
for all kinds of corrections in you.

00:17:08.516 --> 00:17:22.496
These are the Ganas which act through the
left side.

00:17:22.496 --> 00:17:31.095
As we know very well that cancer is caused
by the problems of the Left side.

00:17:31.095 --> 00:17:43.265
And, on the left side are these Ganas, which
are completely in unison with the Devi’s

00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:44.485
powers.

00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:49.466
She doesn’t have to tell them, She doesn’t
have to guide them, they are already built

00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:51.246
up like that.

00:17:51.246 --> 00:18:01.455
And these Ganas are the ones which, I should
say, target, they target the diseases and

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:08.076
cure you.

00:18:08.076 --> 00:18:15.196
We have cured many cancer patients and many
left-sided people through the Ganas.

00:18:15.196 --> 00:18:23.026
But Ganas won’t listen to anybody else.

00:18:23.026 --> 00:18:29.765
And Ganapati is their leader, their controlling
power.

00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:43.925
So, if your Ganapati is alright then problems
are less, but if the Ganapati is not alright,

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:54.106
then all kinds of problems can come up and
they can torture you.

00:18:54.106 --> 00:19:02.005
This is one of the things I am so particular
about, that we must get our Ganeshas corrected.

00:19:02.005 --> 00:19:08.726
The other day I received a big envelope with
letters saying that, “Mother, difficult

00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:16.485
to control Ganas,” but [it’s] difficult
to control Ganapati Himself!

00:19:16.485 --> 00:19:20.666
So, what should we do when we get into traumas?

00:19:20.666 --> 00:19:33.235
A simple thing is, at such a point when you
are in a trauma, and when you cannot overcome

00:19:33.235 --> 00:19:41.056
this defect of the Ganapati, then what you
should do is to meditate.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:48.366
Meditation is the only way you can overcome
Ganas.

00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:59.265
The first of all is the upbringing of the
children and then the atmosphere as it exists.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:12.165
With these two important factors, you can
do well with the Ganas but the problem is

00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:19.535
that human beings get lost and they don’t
look after their Ganapati.

00:20:19.535 --> 00:20:28.216
So, as you worship the Goddess, you are also
worshipping Shri Ganesha who is the power

00:20:28.216 --> 00:20:30.806
behind Her.

00:20:30.806 --> 00:20:42.777
But the greatest power that is belonging to
the Mother is your protection, protection

00:20:42.777 --> 00:20:45.436
from all kinds of things.

00:20:45.436 --> 00:20:49.936
All the left hand side protections are there.

00:20:49.936 --> 00:20:57.546
They are described, as you must have learned,
in the Devi Mahatmyam, what a protections

00:20:57.546 --> 00:20:59.776
She gives you.

00:20:59.776 --> 00:21:10.796
So tremendous is Her protecting power, and
this protecting power gives you understanding:

00:21:10.796 --> 00:21:29.815
how kind She is and how very, very protective
of you, extremely protective.

00:21:29.815 --> 00:21:41.385
She’ll guide you all the time that you should
be protected, on the left side, and through

00:21:41.385 --> 00:21:44.866
Her Ganas She looks after you.

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:57.035
But on the right side also, those who are
on the right side, the Goddess puts Her powers

00:21:57.035 --> 00:22:06.695
to put you right, to bring you back to normal
conditions, to humble you down and make you

00:22:06.695 --> 00:22:19.616
understand that you are a child of the Mother
and you have to behave like a child.

00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:27.676
But, if you go to extremes, then you develop
all kinds of complications of the right side

00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:29.986
also, as you develop on the left side.

00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:37.676
And the right side problems these days are
very, very common, which I have seen people

00:22:37.676 --> 00:22:41.156
cannot get over.

00:22:41.156 --> 00:22:48.135
So many diseases like Alzheimer and other
diseases come up, later on.

00:22:48.135 --> 00:22:52.165
First it starts with the liver.

00:22:52.165 --> 00:23:01.965
The liver is the main point, as we fall into
the trap of the liver.

00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:12.225
If you are thinking too much, if you are futuristic,
if you are aggressive, then the liver goes

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:16.975
out because you use liver’s power to do
all that.

00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:23.565
And when your liver power is over, you are
finished with liver power, you can develop

00:23:23.565 --> 00:23:31.665
so many diseases, so many troubles that you
cannot overcome it, it’s very difficult.

00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:38.135
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, so many people’s
liver has been cured; so many people.

00:23:38.135 --> 00:23:46.035
And it has been doing wonderful work as far
as the liver is concerned, but one should

00:23:46.035 --> 00:23:52.146
humble down and try to keep the liver alright.

00:23:52.146 --> 00:24:03.355
So the protection is also built-in your body
by Ganas on the left hand side and by reactions

00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:12.766
on the right hand side, but the greatest thing
is the blessings of the Mother: the way She

00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:19.665
looks after you, the way She loves you and
the way She cares for you – which you should

00:24:19.665 --> 00:24:22.225
never take it for granted!

00:24:22.225 --> 00:24:32.135
You must meditate, you must meditate, is very
important, no question [that] without meditation

00:24:32.135 --> 00:24:38.136
you cannot keep yourself alright – it’s
no question.

00:24:38.136 --> 00:24:46.086
Meditation is the most important thing which
must be followed because that’s how you

00:24:46.086 --> 00:24:54.176
come close to Her vibrations, come to Her
nature.

00:24:54.176 --> 00:25:01.816
Even animals are so sensitive to Mother, very
sensitive to vibrations; animals are, but

00:25:01.816 --> 00:25:09.895
human beings have their own understanding,
have their own freedom, have their so-called

00:25:09.895 --> 00:25:19.296
intelligence and they fall a trap to it; they
follow things which they should not do.

00:25:19.296 --> 00:25:29.246
So what is necessary very much, in the country
like America, is the devotion and bhakti.

00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:31.806
These two things are not there.

00:25:31.806 --> 00:25:37.406
Indians take to Sahaja Yoga and go deep down
into it because they know what is bhakti,

00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:39.596
what is devotion.

00:25:39.596 --> 00:25:42.026
All this ego and all that melts away.

00:25:42.026 --> 00:25:45.196
But this bhakti is to be enjoyed.

00:25:45.196 --> 00:25:51.856
I don’t know how to create bhakti within
you – that I can’t say.

00:25:51.856 --> 00:25:58.566
But I have seen people with bhakti, they have
achieved great heights, though it’s a left

00:25:58.566 --> 00:25:59.916
side movement.

00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:04.296
With the left side movement they have achieved
great heights.

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:11.835
I don’t know how the bhakti (devotion) and
shraddha (faith) has helped them so much.

00:26:11.835 --> 00:26:22.106
In this, I must say, Indians are the best
because they have this power of bhakti and

00:26:22.106 --> 00:26:23.106
of shraddha.

00:26:23.106 --> 00:26:28.996
It’s not madness, it’s not madness as
they have here: I have seen people who get

00:26:28.996 --> 00:26:33.376
into some sort of a cult or something, they
go mad.

00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:42.585
It’s not madness, bhakti is love, and love
which is understanding, which understands

00:26:42.585 --> 00:26:45.416
what is bhakti and shraddha.

00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:52.096
Unless and until you develop that bhakti and
shraddha within you, you cannot rise, you

00:26:52.096 --> 00:27:07.036
cannot rise above your problems, you cannot
rise above your personality because bhakti

00:27:07.036 --> 00:27:14.025
is something you cannot impose on anyone,
you cannot force on anybody.

00:27:14.025 --> 00:27:23.066
You can make somebody mad and say that he
can do bhakti, but he cannot.

00:27:23.066 --> 00:27:33.786
You have to have all your qualities absolutely
intact: you should be intelligent, you should

00:27:33.786 --> 00:27:40.416
be understanding – everything should be
there, but at that time the joy of bhakti

00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:42.216
is within you.

00:27:42.216 --> 00:27:49.916
And this joy of bhakti when it starts flowing,
the Goddess Herself enters into your being,

00:27:49.916 --> 00:27:51.686
I should say.

00:27:51.686 --> 00:27:58.946
I have seen people, bhaktas, many great saints
in India who achieved a lot of height.

00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:02.796
They’ve gone too far into it.

00:28:02.796 --> 00:28:12.936
And if you read about them and, if you understand
them, you are amazed how, without any help,

00:28:12.936 --> 00:28:21.476
without any guidance, how could they go that
deep and worship Devi?

00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:28.236
Worshipping is not just out of sheer reading
or some sort of a chanting or anything, but

00:28:28.236 --> 00:28:37.786
it’s the deep attention of your heart; I
think it’s Spirit.

00:28:37.786 --> 00:28:46.215
If the Spirit is awakened within you, you
develop the bhakti and drop out all nonsensical

00:28:46.215 --> 00:28:54.346
ideas, all different things that have crawled
into your head, but you just develop the bhakti.

00:28:54.346 --> 00:29:01.945
Now all these qualities described, of the
Devi [that] are left sided, are in the brain:

00:29:01.945 --> 00:29:05.416
memory, ‘smruti rupena sansthita’.

00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:09.645
Other things also – whatever are described
– are in the brain.

00:29:09.645 --> 00:29:16.346
And then the bhakti reaches the state [where]
it just neutralises everything.

00:29:16.346 --> 00:29:22.686
All the problems of the brain are neutralised
and you become a wise person.

00:29:22.686 --> 00:29:27.806
So the greatest boon of the Devi is to give
you wisdom.

00:29:27.806 --> 00:29:35.075
You can call it awareness, you can call it
anything but it’s a kind of a wisdom by

00:29:35.075 --> 00:29:41.926
which you become absolutely a Divine personality.

00:29:41.926 --> 00:29:45.356
That wisdom you must reach through your bhakti.

00:29:45.356 --> 00:29:52.556
But, you see, we have people of all kinds:
some are very much in the shraddha, in the

00:29:52.556 --> 00:30:00.996
bhakti, in the devotion but they are wrongly
placed and they don’t understand to whom

00:30:00.996 --> 00:30:03.546
we should worship and where we should go.

00:30:03.546 --> 00:30:14.715
Now Sahaja Yoga is a actualisation, Sahaja
Yoga is a Sakshat, is actualisation, in which

00:30:14.715 --> 00:30:21.746
you know whom to worship and whom to surrender,
it’s not blind, in any way.

00:30:21.746 --> 00:30:27.465
Whatever is blind bhakti can take you to any
kind of nonsense and that’s how many cults

00:30:27.465 --> 00:30:35.886
have come up, many [of] these things have
come up, but that’s not a thing that sees,

00:30:35.886 --> 00:30:38.976
that knows, that understands.

00:30:38.976 --> 00:30:48.515
It should be understood by your intelligence,
by all your qualities – what is your bhakti

00:30:48.515 --> 00:30:49.515
is like.

00:30:49.515 --> 00:30:57.476
Now we have, through Kundalini awakening,
reached a very great height of understanding

00:30:57.476 --> 00:31:02.265
of bhakti, the power of bhakti.

00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:10.736
The greatest power of bhakti is that it protects
you, it protects you.

00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:20.586
Those people who are suffering from any kind
of trouble, any kind of problems, just get

00:31:20.586 --> 00:31:31.455
out of it because this bhakti of yours gives
you the right type of understanding, the understanding

00:31:31.455 --> 00:31:41.666
of your Self; also the understanding of surroundings,
understanding of the whole Universe, why people

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:47.895
behave like this, why they are like this – all
this can be solved through your bhakti.

00:31:47.895 --> 00:31:55.575
It should not be blind, it should not be blind,
but it should be wise bhakti, wise with wisdom.

00:31:55.575 --> 00:32:00.906
Only possible through Sahaja Yoga, I think,
otherwise, whatever bhakti people do like

00:32:00.906 --> 00:32:03.186
mad, that cannot be bhakti.

00:32:03.186 --> 00:32:15.186
You don’t become mad, you become a wise
man, wise man as we had so many in the past.

00:32:15.186 --> 00:32:20.026
And the way they have talked about everything
is surprising.

00:32:20.026 --> 00:32:29.296
How they have said things about human awareness,
about your ascent is remarkable and sometimes

00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:38.346
I feel that they have really prepared a field
for me, a proper area for me, to talk to people.

00:32:38.346 --> 00:32:49.616
Especially in India, I don’t know why, traditionally
we are very, traditionally we are very much

00:32:49.616 --> 00:32:52.346
devoted people.

00:32:52.346 --> 00:32:55.576
In the same way all over it should happen.

00:32:55.576 --> 00:33:01.866
Because, in India of course there are mad
people also, there are cults, there are all

00:33:01.866 --> 00:33:09.686
kinds of things, no doubt, but actually there
we have saints who have guided us very well.

00:33:09.686 --> 00:33:15.486
Despite that you find in India people are
going astray, doing wrong things and wrong

00:33:15.486 --> 00:33:18.486
type of worshipping.

00:33:18.486 --> 00:33:33.276
This is true, no doubt, but it is just a funny
type of a madness, where there is no wisdom.

00:33:33.276 --> 00:33:38.476
What is [the difference] between a mad and
a sane person is, that a mad person has no

00:33:38.476 --> 00:33:40.136
wisdom.

00:33:40.136 --> 00:33:45.976
And those who have also so-called wisdom,
or so they say, that “we are very wise,”

00:33:45.976 --> 00:33:47.246
are sadly mistaken.

00:33:47.246 --> 00:33:55.026
Because the way they behave, the way they
commit mistakes, the way their whole attention

00:33:55.026 --> 00:34:04.516
is, the whole working is, is sometimes surprising
but [it’s] because they have no wisdom.

00:34:04.516 --> 00:34:08.886
First of all is, to test yourself you must
see, “Am I wise?

00:34:08.886 --> 00:34:10.766
Am I wise?

00:34:10.766 --> 00:34:16.746
Do I do wise things or I’m not doing?”

00:34:16.746 --> 00:34:20.396
So many complaints come to me, about Sahaja
Yogis also.

00:34:20.396 --> 00:34:24.226
I am surprised, why: why are they doing like
that?

00:34:24.226 --> 00:34:28.686
I would say, still, they have not reached
the state of bhakti.

00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:35.406
Bhakti and shraddha, these two things are
missing in the Western life, I must say.

00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:39.526
We should come back, we should develop, we
should grow.

00:34:39.526 --> 00:34:43.076
But, even in the Eastern life now it’s missing.

00:34:43.076 --> 00:34:47.256
For them the ideal is now the Western life.

00:34:47.256 --> 00:34:55.246
Once you take to Western life, that part is
over because the whole thing is judged with

00:34:55.246 --> 00:35:05.486
ideas: what is beneficial, what is helpful
in life.

00:35:05.486 --> 00:35:13.346
But bhakti and shraddha, according to them,
is of no use, that doesn’t help.

00:35:13.346 --> 00:35:18.976
Most of the people nowadays think like that
but you are very few who have understood what

00:35:18.976 --> 00:35:22.096
is bhakti and what is shraddha.

00:35:22.096 --> 00:35:27.606
So, I would say, the Goddess gives you bhakti
and shraddha.

00:35:27.606 --> 00:35:29.846
By what?

00:35:29.846 --> 00:35:37.026
She gives you through your meditation; that
you see so many miracles happening in your

00:35:37.026 --> 00:35:38.026
life and you are amazed.

00:35:38.026 --> 00:35:40.586
“How this has happened?

00:35:40.586 --> 00:35:42.676
We never expected this to happen.

00:35:42.676 --> 00:35:47.156
How it has happened, how it has worked out?”

00:35:47.156 --> 00:35:49.076
Also She corrects you.

00:35:49.076 --> 00:35:55.766
All the time, if you are aware, She corrects
you and tells you, “Don’t go this way!

00:35:55.766 --> 00:35:57.586
You are going on the ego side."

00:35:57.586 --> 00:36:01.066
Or She’ll tell you, “You are going on
the left side."

00:36:01.066 --> 00:36:03.976
She’s the one who corrects, throughout.

00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:11.046
We get into diseases and we are trapped into
all kinds of things; it is because we don’t

00:36:11.046 --> 00:36:12.046
have bhakti.

00:36:12.046 --> 00:36:21.957
In the bhakti, you have to depend on the wisdom
of the Mother, wisdom of the Shakti, that

00:36:21.957 --> 00:36:28.926
She looks after you, She finds you out the
way and She will help you.

00:36:28.926 --> 00:36:37.006
If you start becoming on your own and thinking
that, “I am alright, I can do this, I can

00:36:37.006 --> 00:36:41.806
do that,” you will find inevitably that
you are wrong, that you had a very wrong idea

00:36:41.806 --> 00:36:45.396
about yourself and about the Divine.

00:36:45.396 --> 00:36:50.386
So, what is the most important point is surrendering.

00:36:50.386 --> 00:36:52.506
The word ‘Islam’ means surrender.

00:36:52.506 --> 00:36:59.356
But Mohammed Sahib has described what you
should have before surrender is your Realisation.

00:36:59.356 --> 00:37:05.236
But, you have seen, even after Realisation
people take time to settle down.

00:37:05.236 --> 00:37:11.766
But once you are settled down you understand
that you are under a protection of the Goddess,

00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:17.676
that you see every day how it works and how
it helps you.

00:37:17.676 --> 00:37:25.746
Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga, so-called,
have great respect for me but are not fully

00:37:25.746 --> 00:37:32.066
there; then they suffer and they have problems
and then they ask me, “Mother, how is it

00:37:32.066 --> 00:37:33.496
I have got this problem?”

00:37:33.496 --> 00:37:38.516
I don’t tell them, because you cant tell
anything to human beings, you see, they are

00:37:38.516 --> 00:37:39.516
very aggressive.

00:37:39.516 --> 00:37:48.726
But, the fact is because you are not one with
the Divine.

00:37:48.726 --> 00:37:55.176
And with the Divine if you are one, you’ll
have nothing but compassion and love, nothing

00:37:55.176 --> 00:37:56.176
else.

00:37:56.176 --> 00:37:59.346
And everything you will do so smoothly, so
nicely.

00:37:59.346 --> 00:38:05.186
People may not understand, like they crucified
Christ, they did all kind of things -agreed.

00:38:05.186 --> 00:38:11.856
But now, you should ask for the protection
of the Goddess because that is the greatest

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:18.636
quality of the Goddess, that She protects
you from all problems, from all troubles,

00:38:18.636 --> 00:38:26.446
from all kinds of nonsensical things that
can happen.

00:38:26.446 --> 00:38:28.936
And there are so many things that happen.

00:38:28.936 --> 00:38:36.216
I tell you, I was told that one of the leaders
of Sahaja Yogi was killed.

00:38:36.216 --> 00:38:38.446
I said, “Not possible!”

00:38:38.446 --> 00:38:44.276
And the fellow was in Rome, he was not killed.

00:38:44.276 --> 00:38:50.576
So, it’s not possible that a young man should
be killed like that.

00:38:50.576 --> 00:38:54.846
Of course, if somebody is old you have to
die, but that he was killed, was not a right

00:38:54.846 --> 00:38:55.846
thing.

00:38:55.846 --> 00:39:01.886
So it is the protection, not only physical,
mental, emotional, but spiritual protection

00:39:01.886 --> 00:39:03.696
comes to you.

00:39:03.696 --> 00:39:07.756
Spiritual protection in that what you do is
that you don’t do wrong things.

00:39:07.756 --> 00:39:14.336
You don’t kill anybody, you don’t torture
anybody, you are not rude to anybody, that

00:39:14.336 --> 00:39:20.596
is the situation into which you all can enter
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:20.596 --> 00:39:22.646
You can achieve it.

00:39:22.646 --> 00:39:31.866
You have a power to do it because you have
so much shraddha and so much understanding

00:39:31.866 --> 00:39:39.346
that you have reached the certain state of
protection, of growth of wisdom.

00:39:39.346 --> 00:39:46.016
Now first test your wisdom, you must test
your wisdom, “If I am doing this, is this

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:49.666
wise, is it good, why I am doing it?”

00:39:49.666 --> 00:39:55.216
First test your wisdom, then you’ll find
out that many things you do which are wrong,

00:39:55.216 --> 00:39:57.656
which should not have been done.

00:39:57.656 --> 00:40:03.696
But first your wisdom must develop and you
must see that your wisdom works and helps

00:40:03.696 --> 00:40:04.696
you.

00:40:04.696 --> 00:40:08.646
I have seen now, yesterday’s drama (evening
programme play), you must have seen that girl

00:40:08.646 --> 00:40:13.706
she is very sensitive and she could see through
her wisdom what was good.

00:40:13.706 --> 00:40:22.796
If you cannot find out what is good and what
is bad that means the wisdom is lacking.

00:40:22.796 --> 00:40:28.766
If you cannot find out what should you do
then the wisdom is lacking.

00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:36.936
But, if you have the wisdom, then you will
immediately know that this is wrong.

00:40:36.936 --> 00:40:43.046
Apart from that, you’ll be saved from all
kinds of problems; it’s a fact, I have seen

00:40:43.046 --> 00:40:50.086
with so many people like that, who have been
saved, not only from death, but from all kinds

00:40:50.086 --> 00:40:54.416
of catastrophes, all kinds.

00:40:54.416 --> 00:41:00.956
And I was amazed how these Sahaja Yogis are
helped by the Divine.

00:41:00.956 --> 00:41:05.686
Divine is a power, everywhere it exists.

00:41:05.686 --> 00:41:13.116
But it will only help the people who are Sahaj
Yogis, who are divine – not the people who

00:41:13.116 --> 00:41:20.926
are not, it will never help you, on the contrary
it might punish in a way that is never expected.

00:41:20.926 --> 00:41:28.046
So, one has to be careful to test oneself,
what I call ‘introspection’: Have you

00:41:28.046 --> 00:41:32.166
been wise in dealing with certain problems?

00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.196
What has been your style?

00:41:34.196 --> 00:41:38.016
Is it money oriented or it is domination oriented.

00:41:38.016 --> 00:41:43.666
But what sort of a power it was that you were
working under?

00:41:43.666 --> 00:41:46.686
You have to introspect to find out.

00:41:46.686 --> 00:41:54.366
And you will be amazed, very much amazed,
that even in the name of God you can do wrong

00:41:54.366 --> 00:41:55.366
things.

00:41:55.366 --> 00:41:59.256
Lots of wrong things have been done in the
name of God and that’s why today we have

00:41:59.256 --> 00:42:06.026
such a big chaos of so called ‘religions’,
when nothing was religion with religion as

00:42:06.026 --> 00:42:10.706
such, and those religious people who talked
about it – nothing wrong – but the way

00:42:10.706 --> 00:42:15.066
people absorbed it and the way people used
it was wrong.

00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:17.726
Because [what] they lacked is wisdom.

00:42:17.726 --> 00:42:24.066
And the wisdom is the thing which really is
not just assumption that, “I am very wise

00:42:24.066 --> 00:42:31.876
and all that,” but it asserts, it works
out and it shows what is good and what is

00:42:31.876 --> 00:42:32.876
bad.

00:42:32.876 --> 00:42:40.476
Wisdom is the sign of a person who is really
a realised soul of a very high level.

00:42:40.476 --> 00:42:47.456
If you don’t have wisdom whatever you may
do, you might feel satisfied about it, but

00:42:47.456 --> 00:42:50.656
the wisdom part is very, very important.

00:42:50.656 --> 00:43:01.376
That is the most governing part within us
and as you know, Ganesha is the giver of wisdom.

00:43:01.376 --> 00:43:15.476
That’s why Ganesha must be worshipped.

00:43:15.476 --> 00:43:29.376
With the proper upbringing Shri Ganesha is
established, who is nothing but the giver

00:43:29.376 --> 00:43:35.826
of wisdom.

00:43:35.826 --> 00:43:43.826
And this wisdom is innate, you don’t have
to judge it, it’s innate within us, grown

00:43:43.826 --> 00:43:47.406
up, just like any other qualities in us.

00:43:47.406 --> 00:43:58.076
It takes time with some people, it takes time,
no doubt, but once it comes in, such a person

00:43:58.076 --> 00:44:06.316
becomes quiet, simple and absolutely truthful.

00:44:06.316 --> 00:44:09.886
He knows about it.

00:44:09.886 --> 00:44:19.026
And this is the thing one should develop is,
“How far am I wise?”

00:44:19.026 --> 00:44:23.806
You see in this world people are protesting
for this, protesting for that, fighting for

00:44:23.806 --> 00:44:26.116
this, doing all kinds of things.

00:44:26.116 --> 00:44:33.926
But if you have wisdom, then you don’t have
to do anything of the kind!

00:44:33.926 --> 00:44:41.036
What happens is that automatically people
understand that he’s a wise man.

00:44:41.036 --> 00:44:45.446
From ancient times everywhere a wise man has
been praised.

00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:52.206
He’s not worried about his financial side,
or emotional side, nothing!

00:44:52.206 --> 00:44:57.596
What he is worried is, “Have I been a wise
person?”

00:44:57.596 --> 00:45:02.106
That is the first sign of the blessings of
God.

00:45:02.106 --> 00:45:10.286
The one who has blessings of Divine is a wise
person, he’s very wise and his wisdom is

00:45:10.286 --> 00:45:12.926
shown by his silence.

00:45:12.926 --> 00:45:23.456
And the Whole Power, the Divine Power, uses
that person as a media and works tremendously.

00:45:23.456 --> 00:45:27.546
That man himself is surprised how it has helped
him.

00:45:27.546 --> 00:45:35.485
A woman can have that, a man can have it,
anybody can have that wisdom, that profoundness,

00:45:35.485 --> 00:45:45.966
that temperament which is so beautiful and
so empowering.

00:45:45.966 --> 00:45:53.726
Such a person doesn’t curse anyone, doesn’t
bother to curse anyone, but it works.

00:45:53.726 --> 00:45:59.586
He never gets angry with anyone, but it works.

00:45:59.586 --> 00:46:13.976
He doesn’t lose temper, no, but some temper
works and harms you which you never expected.

00:46:13.976 --> 00:46:21.406
It is within us, within our power as human
beings, to be wise.

00:46:21.406 --> 00:46:28.566
I have seen animals have such a sensitivity
to vibrations, extremely sensitive.

00:46:28.566 --> 00:46:29.726
How?

00:46:29.726 --> 00:46:31.106
Because their wisdom is intact.

00:46:31.106 --> 00:46:35.536
It works in them, they are not conscious of
it.

00:46:35.536 --> 00:46:43.186
The difference is, human beings are conscious
of their wisdom, that’s the only difference.

00:46:43.186 --> 00:46:48.366
Animals have wisdom, but automatic, we should
say, natural.

00:46:48.366 --> 00:46:57.246
But we have inculcated this, or we have developed
this wisdom within us, through what?

00:46:57.246 --> 00:47:05.216
Through our meditation, through our understanding
of bhakti and shraddha.

00:47:05.216 --> 00:47:13.286
So it’s very important to understand the
value of bhakti within us.

00:47:13.286 --> 00:47:16.136
You cannot superficially touch it.

00:47:16.136 --> 00:47:20.376
Those who are superficial will never get it.

00:47:20.376 --> 00:47:30.486
Wisdom only comes through understanding what
is wisdom is.

00:47:30.486 --> 00:47:36.756
You might find somebody extremely wise, he
may be your servant, may be your driver, may

00:47:36.756 --> 00:47:42.826
be anyone, and you are amazed how such a person
can be so wise.

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:50.926
Because, maybe from his last life, he has
got it within him, or he has gone into it

00:47:50.926 --> 00:47:54.446
and he found it.

00:47:54.446 --> 00:48:01.496
Is not the estate of one person, is not the
property of one person but it can belong to

00:48:01.496 --> 00:48:03.606
many of them.

00:48:03.606 --> 00:48:10.546
So the Sahaj Yogi is the one who has to have
that wisdom, “Why I am doing this?

00:48:10.546 --> 00:48:11.686
What is the need to do it?”

00:48:11.686 --> 00:48:15.386
They don’t have to ask any questions, they
just don’t do wrong things.

00:48:15.386 --> 00:48:18.186
They just don’t do wrong things.

00:48:18.186 --> 00:48:21.466
They are always on the right path.

00:48:21.466 --> 00:48:27.226
That is the sign of a Sahaj Yogi, I believe,
and which is the blessing of the Goddess.If

00:48:27.226 --> 00:48:34.136
there is the Power of the Goddess working
in you, you will have the wisdom to work it

00:48:34.136 --> 00:48:35.136
out.

00:48:35.136 --> 00:48:39.736
Now you have seen many people coming to America,
doing all kinds of things.

00:48:39.736 --> 00:48:41.766
They all have disappeared.

00:48:41.766 --> 00:48:43.926
There’s no support to them, where are they?

00:48:43.926 --> 00:48:45.086
They are finished.

00:48:45.086 --> 00:48:51.186
Because they were money oriented, or power
oriented, I don’t know what they were oriented!

00:48:51.186 --> 00:48:53.216
And they have lost it.

00:48:53.216 --> 00:49:00.966
But for a person who is standing in his wisdom,
is the sage as they call him, is the saint

00:49:00.966 --> 00:49:03.426
as they call it.

00:49:03.426 --> 00:49:11.616
But, this can be every Sahaja Yogi could be
a saint, could be a sage, every Sahaja Yogi

00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:12.856
could be that.

00:49:12.856 --> 00:49:17.776
But if you lose your wisdom then you are no
good.

00:49:17.776 --> 00:49:25.216
So, I have to tell you one thing: it’s your
wisdom which will save you.

00:49:25.216 --> 00:49:30.446
Your wisdom will unconsciously help you.

00:49:30.446 --> 00:49:38.626
There was one gentleman, Sahaj Yogi, once
he was going somewhere in the car and suddenly

00:49:38.626 --> 00:49:43.456
decided to go on to another road, suddenly.

00:49:43.456 --> 00:49:48.366
And what happened, that on that road there
was a very big accident and he would have

00:49:48.366 --> 00:49:51.536
been in that accident.

00:49:51.536 --> 00:49:57.346
Like that there are many incidents people
have told me, that, “Mother, how we were

00:49:57.346 --> 00:50:07.365
saved, how we were brought to the brink of
death and then how we are just alive."

00:50:07.365 --> 00:50:14.605
It is because the Divine needs you, Divine
doesn’t want you to die, or to finish off,

00:50:14.605 --> 00:50:16.315
it needs you very much.

00:50:16.315 --> 00:50:21.715
It has to do its work and you are the instrument
of that Divine.

00:50:21.715 --> 00:50:29.686
If you have wisdom you are the best instrument
for the Divine to work it out.

00:50:29.686 --> 00:50:37.705
The Devi’s powers first of all existed in
Her body only and She killed so many rakshasas

00:50:37.705 --> 00:50:42.295
and evil people – She did, kill it, actually.

00:50:42.295 --> 00:50:47.636
But now, there’s no need because you all
are there and you are the instruments.

00:50:47.636 --> 00:50:53.406
And it will all work out in such a way that
all those people who are trying to destroy

00:50:53.406 --> 00:51:04.576
the goodness, trying to destroy wise people,
they will be killed, they’ll be finished,

00:51:04.576 --> 00:51:05.906
they’ll be destroyed.

00:51:05.906 --> 00:51:10.576
This is not to be done through any outside
instrument or anything.

00:51:10.576 --> 00:51:15.765
It’s your wisdom, is the biggest instrument
that will work it out.

00:51:15.765 --> 00:51:21.975
Do you know, when I came to America first,
I saw such a horrible thing here: that people

00:51:21.975 --> 00:51:28.146
were running after some horrible ‘gurus’
and I never came [again], after nine years

00:51:28.146 --> 00:51:30.636
I came because I said, “These people are
mad!

00:51:30.636 --> 00:51:33.195
How do they follow these horrible people?

00:51:33.195 --> 00:51:34.705
And why do they believe into it?

00:51:34.705 --> 00:51:37.955
They have no wisdom to understand what is
the Truth is like."

00:51:37.955 --> 00:51:43.225
And it works out, now, today, you can see
there are so many people here.

00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:47.015
So, that is what is the wisdom part.

00:51:47.015 --> 00:51:51.816
And if this wisdom comes to Americans they’ll
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:51.816 --> 00:51:52.975
Not only come, but they will grow into it.

00:51:52.975 --> 00:52:01.305
But the wisdom will be, to see, “What are
we going to do, what are we going to get,

00:52:01.305 --> 00:52:03.156
what is our aim?”

00:52:03.156 --> 00:52:07.535
All these things must be brought to them,
which is not done normally.

00:52:07.535 --> 00:52:15.045
We must talk to them, and we must tell them
that, “What is within you is the Spirit.

00:52:15.045 --> 00:52:18.795
You should become the Spirit, everyone of
them has said so.

00:52:18.795 --> 00:52:20.805
So why not do that?

00:52:20.805 --> 00:52:22.986
And why not become the Spirit?”

00:52:22.986 --> 00:52:28.466
So, then they will themselves feel, “Yes,
that’s true.

00:52:28.466 --> 00:52:34.045
It’s said that you should become the Spirit."

00:52:34.045 --> 00:52:37.346
They’ll go to Church, they’ll go to temples,
they’ll go here, there, not understanding

00:52:37.346 --> 00:52:39.666
why they are doing it?

00:52:39.666 --> 00:52:45.846
They need some sort of a protection, that’s
why they go, but this protection comes from

00:52:45.846 --> 00:52:52.836
your spiritual status, where do you stand
as far as the Spirit is concerned.

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:58.646
Those who have enjoyed the Spirit, I have
seen do not deviate from the right path.

00:52:58.646 --> 00:53:04.876
But those who haven’t, they may call themselves
Sahaj Yogis, anything, but they can be very

00:53:04.876 --> 00:53:05.876
wrong.

00:53:05.876 --> 00:53:09.436
So, first of all, find out about yourself.

00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:20.305
If you are a real Sahaj Yogi, if you really
want to be a instrument of This Power, then,

00:53:20.305 --> 00:53:27.045
what you have to do is to become full of bhakti
and shraddha for that.

00:53:27.045 --> 00:53:31.956
And this bhakti and shraddha is very joy giving,
I know that.

00:53:31.956 --> 00:53:37.785
It never makes you tired, it never troubles
you, nothing!

00:53:37.785 --> 00:53:42.336
But it’s very nourishing and beautiful.

00:53:42.336 --> 00:53:49.025
But it should be at the right place with the
right aims and right understanding.

00:53:49.025 --> 00:53:53.136
For all that what you need again is wisdom.

00:53:53.136 --> 00:53:55.206
And you should try to find out – are you
wise enough?

00:53:55.206 --> 00:54:00.235
Are you wise, or are you not?

00:54:00.235 --> 00:54:07.336
It’s very difficult for every human being
to find out whether you are right or wrong

00:54:07.336 --> 00:54:13.176
because, you see the effects of this wisdom
all around.

00:54:13.176 --> 00:54:21.995
So, the bhakti and shraddha to the Goddess
gives you, definitely gives you, wisdom.

00:54:21.995 --> 00:54:30.656
We have had some people in India who did lots
of bhakti, so called, and showed lots of shraddha,

00:54:30.656 --> 00:54:34.856
but they were not, they were not.

00:54:34.856 --> 00:54:41.755
Just they were talking about it, or doing
all kinds of things about it but they were

00:54:41.755 --> 00:54:42.755
not.

00:54:42.755 --> 00:54:48.326
So wisdom is something a very innate quality,
very innate, its not superficial.

00:54:48.326 --> 00:54:52.805
You cannot just say that this person, is he
wise or not.

00:54:52.805 --> 00:55:01.275
It shows, just like a power, it’s a power
of understanding and is supported by the Power

00:55:01.275 --> 00:55:02.755
of the Goddess.

00:55:02.755 --> 00:55:04.446
So She is the giver of wisdom.

00:55:04.446 --> 00:55:10.656
This is the biggest quality of the Goddess,
that She is the giver of wisdom.

00:55:10.656 --> 00:55:14.666
And wisdom comes as a part of the evolutionary
process.

00:55:14.666 --> 00:55:20.965
Now She has brought about all the evolution
so far, and to go further She is going to

00:55:20.965 --> 00:55:24.235
make you a very wise person.

00:55:24.235 --> 00:55:32.285
Even an ordinary sage in a village, in a far-fetched
places is respected if he is a real sage.

00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:38.166
But, [if] he is a stupid fellow, what can
you do?

00:55:38.166 --> 00:55:42.205
He may befool you, may do all kind of tricks
and things like that.

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:47.695
And then, does he get anything good for you?

00:55:47.695 --> 00:55:48.985
No, nothing.

00:55:48.985 --> 00:55:55.836
So first thing is: anybody who is supposed
to be your guru or supposed to be the person

00:55:55.836 --> 00:56:00.586
who is guiding you, must have bhakti, bhakti
of the Goddess.

00:56:00.586 --> 00:56:02.896
It’s very important to understand.

00:56:02.896 --> 00:56:08.636
Modern things have such, come to such a limit,
that they have no respect for the Goddess,

00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:14.445
no, they don’t even talk about the Goddess
and they just talk about something which cannot

00:56:14.445 --> 00:56:16.035
be explained and understood.

00:56:16.035 --> 00:56:22.316
If they talk about Christ they won’t talk
about Him, that He is the one who said at

00:56:22.316 --> 00:56:25.275
the cross, “Behold the Mother”.

00:56:25.275 --> 00:56:29.015
What was the need to say that?

00:56:29.015 --> 00:56:34.975
Because He didn’t want His Mother to get
into trouble, but He said, “Behold The Mother,”

00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:39.366
that means, “Look out for the Mother who
is going to come."

00:56:39.366 --> 00:56:46.176
They all have indicated and they have said
so but still we are busy with our own ego

00:56:46.176 --> 00:56:52.336
and our own understanding and we run after
things which are not real.

00:56:52.336 --> 00:56:57.715
First of all you must follow only thing that
is real, not unreal things.

00:56:57.715 --> 00:57:01.756
For that also, again, you need wisdom.

00:57:01.756 --> 00:57:05.356
I think for that you need wisdom very much
more.

00:57:05.356 --> 00:57:09.186
And that is something, whether you have the
wisdom first, or you have the blessings of

00:57:09.186 --> 00:57:13.995
the Mother, is between the two.

00:57:13.995 --> 00:57:22.766
So I have to tell you one thing that: before
you people start spreading Sahaja Yoga, please

00:57:22.766 --> 00:57:23.946
judge yourself.

00:57:23.946 --> 00:57:27.495
Just see if you are wise.

00:57:27.495 --> 00:57:31.265
Also see for yourself if you have the blessings
of the Mother.

00:57:31.265 --> 00:57:44.235
Only the wise are the people who know whether
they have the Mother’s blessings or not.

00:57:44.235 --> 00:57:48.406
For that we have so many ways of understanding.

00:57:48.406 --> 00:57:57.235
First and foremost thing is meditation and
feeling your vibrations on the photograph

00:57:57.235 --> 00:58:00.816
and facing yourself clearly.

00:58:00.816 --> 00:58:06.406
If you are a realised soul, are you really
a good realised soul or not?

00:58:06.406 --> 00:58:08.455
Are you deep or not?

00:58:08.455 --> 00:58:11.326
Are your vibrations working out or not?

00:58:11.326 --> 00:58:20.636
If you can see that then you will realise
that greater than all ambitions, the greatest

00:58:20.636 --> 00:58:28.735
is to become a devoted, wise personality.

00:58:28.735 --> 00:58:36.455
That is the one that will give you the joy,
joy for all kinds of things.

00:58:36.455 --> 00:58:41.986
Otherwise it is just a human being like others
going about.

00:58:41.986 --> 00:58:45.576
Now the time has come for this to work out.

00:58:45.576 --> 00:58:47.755
It’s a special time, I should say.

00:58:47.755 --> 00:58:52.495
Although, quite a lot of struggle for me,
no doubt, but doesn’t matter, I know, because

00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:59.916
I have landed myself in the area where things
are not so simple, it doesn’t matter.

00:58:59.916 --> 00:59:06.785
But, on the whole, what I feel is you can
support me very much, you can support my work

00:59:06.785 --> 00:59:09.726
very much, if you have that wisdom.

00:59:09.726 --> 00:59:14.456
And the wisdom is to judge yourself: how many
people you love?

00:59:14.456 --> 00:59:16.066
How you love?

00:59:16.066 --> 00:59:18.426
How you talk to them?

00:59:18.426 --> 00:59:20.295
What do you want out of them?

00:59:20.295 --> 00:59:22.076
All this should come.

00:59:22.076 --> 00:59:24.455
Judge yourself – introspection.

00:59:24.455 --> 00:59:26.436
Through introspection you can see it.

00:59:26.436 --> 00:59:32.285
So, for a Sahaja Yogi is important is introspection.

00:59:32.285 --> 00:59:36.176
Second one is meditation.

00:59:36.176 --> 00:59:39.445
And third one is to take vibrations.

00:59:39.445 --> 00:59:41.146
It’s very important.

00:59:41.146 --> 00:59:45.096
What I find, some of them say, “Mother,
we don’t do this, we don’t do that,”

00:59:45.096 --> 00:59:46.096
“But why?

00:59:46.096 --> 00:59:47.515
Why not do it?”

00:59:47.515 --> 00:59:49.126
“We do Sahaja Yoga!”

00:59:49.126 --> 00:59:50.745
Sahaja Yoga, which part?

00:59:50.745 --> 00:59:55.715
If you are not doing these basic things, how
are you a Sahaja Yogi?

00:59:55.715 --> 01:00:00.816
And then lots of complications come out of
them, they also suffer.

01:00:00.816 --> 01:00:07.936
I think one has to have again the wisdom to
understand what is Sahaja Yoga is.

01:00:07.936 --> 01:00:14.235
No one understands that sometimes, and they
go on forming a group of people who are not

01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:17.235
at all understanding what is Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:17.235 --> 01:00:21.166
It’s a very, very deep personality.

01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:29.866
Sahaja Yoga is not just by saying, “I am
a Sahaja Yogi,” but it’s a very deep personality,

01:00:29.866 --> 01:00:38.336
and that deep personality has to be felt by
others as the wise, very wise thing.

01:00:38.336 --> 01:00:45.066
Not that how much you talk or shout or give
lectures is important; is with peace, the

01:00:45.066 --> 01:00:54.666
tranquillity, the capacity to love within
you are important and that’s how people

01:00:54.666 --> 01:01:01.176
can judge whether you are really blessed by
your Mother or not.

01:01:01.176 --> 01:01:06.715
So, this is one of the things very important
when I’ve come to America just to protect

01:01:06.715 --> 01:01:12.906
America from problems, because suddenly this
has grown into problems.

01:01:12.906 --> 01:01:20.785
And it was inevitable because they were blind
here not to understand what’s going wrong

01:01:20.785 --> 01:01:27.535
with them and that blindness has brought them
to this point that they start seeing their

01:01:27.535 --> 01:01:34.406
ego specially, which has ruined them – money
orientation.

01:01:34.406 --> 01:01:40.216
All this has shown how stupid they have been
to believe that they are very rich people

01:01:40.216 --> 01:01:47.846
and they can do anything they want to with
their money and with overpowering of other

01:01:47.846 --> 01:01:50.676
countries and other people.

01:01:50.676 --> 01:01:52.805
First overpower yourself.

01:01:52.805 --> 01:01:55.805
You have to know yourself first of all.

01:01:55.805 --> 01:01:58.596
What’s the use of overpowering others?

01:01:58.596 --> 01:02:06.846
Those who do not know how to overpower themselves
are always miserable, always in trouble because

01:02:06.846 --> 01:02:07.846
it reacts.

01:02:07.846 --> 01:02:12.705
If you try to overpower others, it reacts.

01:02:12.705 --> 01:02:20.676
For that you have to be absolutely introspecting,
again and again I have been saying this that,

01:02:20.676 --> 01:02:21.676
“Introspect."

01:02:21.676 --> 01:02:27.795
Of course, I must say, so many good Sahaj
Yogis have come out now and they have worked

01:02:27.795 --> 01:02:31.576
it out, and they are very good, simple, wise
people.

01:02:31.576 --> 01:02:39.215
It’s such a great hope for me, I never expected
I will work it out that good, but it has worked

01:02:39.215 --> 01:02:46.225
out and always, always, you must know you
have That Power within you and then must use

01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:51.436
that power and not fall a prey into nonsensical
ideas.

01:02:51.436 --> 01:02:53.416
Thank you very much
