00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:03,579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:13,178
 I was overjoyed to see

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:21,177
this beautiful welcome.the way you had organized

4
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:31,287
I must say that it’s your love which finds

5
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:42,112
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:52,332
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

7
00:00:52,658 --> 00:01:00,681
come to your heads, and you represent

8
00:01:00,718 --> 00:01:06,421
the different countries from where you have come.

9
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:15,519
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

10
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:20,705
and tell them the message that the time has come

11
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:27,522
 for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

12
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:33,589
We have to rise above this human level

13
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:37,414
to a higher level of existence.

14
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:43,369
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

15
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:52,070
 how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

16
00:01:52,317 --> 00:02:05,424
 and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

17
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:13,588
 which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

18
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:22,917
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

19
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:27,814
 the joy of others, the happiness of others.

20
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:35,603
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

21
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:42,390
 you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

22
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:48,452
You have already done it, and gradually once

23
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:54,878
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

24
00:02:55,338 --> 00:03:00,131
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

25
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:05,817
so very important that all others in your countries

26
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:14,398
 also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

27
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:19,343
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

28
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:25,592
 the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

29
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:33,045
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

30
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:37,379
 and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

31
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:44,541
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

32
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:52,677
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

33
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:57,360
you go beyond all the three gunas.

34
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:06,719
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

35
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:17,901
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

36
00:04:19,283 --> 00:04:24,643
Your attention moves from there to the second style

37
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,019
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

38
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:31,952
they want to do something, want to show something,

39
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:36,530
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

40
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,498
All this struggle just disappears.

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,658
"Atit" means beyond.

42
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,594
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

43
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:54,280
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

44
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:58,112
and you just hate that kind of life

45
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:03,667
 and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

46
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:06,503
That also is finished.

47
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:13,531
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

48
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:20,716
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

49
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:28,204
 because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

50
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:34,417
 you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

51
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:42,246
So you become a person who is beyond this.

52
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:50,128
This is something very remarkable as far as

53
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:54,817
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

54
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,588
You just enjoy being yourself.

55
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:04,157
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

56
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:08,825
But what happens is that you just go beyond

57
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:12,587
all these three gunas which have been

58
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:18,251
dominating you this way or that way.

59
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:28,375
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

60
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:39,336
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

61
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:43,715
I know today I was late somehow.

62
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,407
It just works out that way.

63
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:48,730
But you didn’t miss the time.

64
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:52,510
You were still enjoying.
 I could see, sitting in the house,

65
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:55,381
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

66
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:58,419
all of you are enjoying nicely.

67
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:02,339
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

68
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,862
This is beyond time.

69
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,233
You’re not bound by time.

70
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:11,207
Whatever is the time is your own, because

71
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:13,937
you are standing in the present,

72
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,568
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

73
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,227
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

74
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:27,204
 or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

75
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,473
Here you were just enjoying,

76
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:34,370
 enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

77
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:39,299
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

78
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:42,553
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

79
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:45,877
 that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

80
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:49,906
So at this moment you are here sitting,

81
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:53,875
 perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

82
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:58,232
 just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

83
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:01,534
 of your connections with others.

84
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,558
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

85
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,716
 how you are enjoying this.

86
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:12,693
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

87
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:15,415
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

88
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:17,280
What is the problem?

89
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:23,757
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

90
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:27,643
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

91
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:32,520
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

92
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,773
 no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

93
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:39,159
they were so shy and so much worried.

94
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,932
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

95
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:46,694
 that My car failed on the way and

96
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,533
I was delayed in going.

97
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:58,470
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

98
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,695
and we were stranded on the road.

99
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,716
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

100
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:11,635
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

101
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:16,823
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

102
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,817
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

103
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:22,714
Otherwise they would not.

104
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:26,099
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

105
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,691
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

106
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,087
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

107
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:41,783
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
 so it’s our responsibility.”

108
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:45,347
In that way they took the responsibility.

109
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:50,805
So when you are beyond the time,
 you become responsible for that moment.

110
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,309
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

111
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:01,558
means you just all of you become responsible.

112
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:06,630
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

113
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,093
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

114
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:14,980
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

115
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:20,210
 all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

116
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:27,508
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

117
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,132
The time cannot bow you down.

118
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:34,135
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

119
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:37,570
 they would have thrown stones on My car,

120
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:43,332
 thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

121
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,757
They would have resented.

122
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:49,181
But not the people who are beyond time.

123
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:52,430
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

124
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:58,151
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

125
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:05,928
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

126
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:13,960
 beyond your human nature.

127
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:19,376
That means whatever you do is religious,

128
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:26,135
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

129
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,897
If, say, you are in a business,

130
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:35,158
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

131
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:40,168
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

132
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:44,620
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

133
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:47,239
but you are beyond it.

134
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:56,134
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

135
00:11:56,602 --> 00:12:01,132
 they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

136
00:12:01,624 --> 00:12:06,321
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

137
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:11,169
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

138
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,831
But not you.

139
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:16,055
For you, you are always in dhyan,

140
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:20,682
 always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

141
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:23,909
you just jump into that awareness

142
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:28,277
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

143
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:33,704
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

144
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:39,460
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

145
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,840
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

146
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:48,346
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

147
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:54,051
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

148
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,474
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

149
00:12:57,553 --> 00:13:03,933
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

150
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:05,814
"All right.

151
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,010
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

152
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:11,984
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

153
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:14,941
So she said that "You have to be careful

154
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:19,822
that even the spoon should not be used."

155
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,979
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

156
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:29,461
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

157
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:32,639
 who are eating non–veg. food,

158
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:38,216
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

159
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,268
So I had to incur all these problems.

160
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:45,178
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

161
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,385
our cook to cook anything for us.

162
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,776
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

163
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,021
And she made such a nuisance out of her

164
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:58,227
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

165
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:02,451
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

166
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,983
 because they are very demanding.

167
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:08,733
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

168
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:14,797
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

169
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:18,731
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

170
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,159
 she was related to something very high up,

171
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:26,831
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

172
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,666
I said, "Really?"

173
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:32,292
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

174
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,839
 we have such people still living.

175
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:39,932
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

176
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,887
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

177
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,674
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

178
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:51,243
So people had to go and fetch the water,

179
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:56,008
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

180
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:58,390
and then only he could cook.

181
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:01,824
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

182
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,335
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

183
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,789
 the cook got sick with pneumonia,

184
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:12,718
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

185
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:13,990
This lady didn’t mind.

186
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,190
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

187
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,469
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

188
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:23,575
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

189
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,545
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

190
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,733
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

191
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:36,306
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

192
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:39,814
 and so much bothering others.”

193
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:42,927
So this self-centeredness comes to us

194
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,800
because we think, "This is our dharma,

195
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:50,430
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

196
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:53,335
How dare they do not do it?"

197
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,844
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

198
00:15:57,963 --> 00:16:05,191
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
 we never think.

199
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:08,152
We go on demanding things,

200
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:13,224
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

201
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,622
This is what I have to do.”

202
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,948
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

203
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,835
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

204
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,709
who got conditioned like that.

205
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:29,489
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

206
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,698
 and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

207
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:40,157
 and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

208
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:45,552
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

209
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:48,666
And one day she just disappeared.

210
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:51,862
So they told the police to find out this lady,

211
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:55,794
and when he went to find out the lady,
 the police said that

212
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:59,162
 "We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

213
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,752
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

214
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,056
She was still sitting in the church.

215
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,417
Next time again she disappeared.

216
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,231
It happened three, four times.

217
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:12,255
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

218
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,610
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

219
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:21,070
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

220
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:25,867
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

221
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:28,740
 they are otherwise very stupid people,

222
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:34,177
 they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

223
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:39,445
 they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

224
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:45,512
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

225
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:49,913
That’s the only point where they are sane."

226
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:53,313
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

227
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,139
There was one person I had

228
00:17:56,282 --> 00:18:00,345
 who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

229
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,953
So I said, "All right."

230
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:04,662
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

231
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,988
what sort of a place London is.

232
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,778
Now he knew the driving very well,

233
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:14,329
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

234
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,198
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

235
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,799
I said, "What’s the matter?

236
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,556
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

237
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,430
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

238
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:29,424
One day the police got hold of him.

239
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,924
I was also in the car.

240
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,004
He said, "Where are you going?"

241
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:36,447
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

242
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:40,331
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

243
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:44,115
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

244
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,517
So in the old age I have known that these things form

245
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,660
 a kind of a habit,

246
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:54,490
 but in young age also you can find people

247
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:57,641
get so conditioned by their style.

248
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:03,097
So this is what you can call the human element,

249
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:08,432
 where you get attached or get bothered about something.

250
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,164
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

251
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,672
 that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

252
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:21,780
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

253
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,325
It goes on, and on, and on.

254
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:29,552
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

255
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:34,262
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

256
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:38,448
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

257
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:42,296
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

258
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,216
This person has purchased the carpet.

259
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,154
What have you got to do?

260
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:47,857
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

261
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:48,985
Who are you?

262
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,471
You have not paid for you.

263
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:53,624
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

264
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:56,952
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

265
00:19:56,977 --> 00:20:00,243
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

266
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:04,321
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

267
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:07,562
 but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

268
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:08,828
"Why?"

269
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:12,731
"I don’t like, that’s all."

270
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:22,838
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

271
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:27,087
Who are you to like or dislike?

272
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,293
What is your position?

273
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:34,346
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

274
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:38,374
But is very common, specially in the West,

275
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:42,905
 to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

276
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:45,032
"I don’t like India."

277
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:47,160
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

278
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:48,898
Why did you come here?"

279
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,073
"I don’t like Turkey."

280
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:52,668
"Why?"

281
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,857
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

282
00:20:57,934 --> 00:21:02,455
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

283
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:05,911
So you should only wear short skirts.

284
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:09,273
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

285
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:12,501
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

286
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:18,149
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

287
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,101
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

288
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:27,311
you must know that you are not normal human being,

289
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:32,718
 according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

290
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:37,241
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

291
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,321
and your whole attitude has changed.

292
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:45,670
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

293
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:51,073
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

294
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,926
 and sometimes you talk very profound things.

295
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:59,510
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

296
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:03,464
 because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

297
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:08,949
 all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

298
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:18,221
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

299
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:23,077
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

300
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:30,389
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

301
00:22:30,874 --> 00:22:38,136
 a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

302
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:42,293
 “with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

303
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:46,131
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

304
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:52,503
 “you are, you are, you are." You are...

305
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,590
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

306
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:05,312
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

307
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:09,939
 using your brains all the time to criticize others,

308
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:15,525
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

309
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:17,782
People enjoy gossips.

310
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:19,123
Why?

311
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,360
They enjoy gossip

312
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:26,440
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

313
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:30,397
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

314
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:34,460
So this understanding, I should say this loving

315
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:39,121
 wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

316
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:44,176
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

317
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:49,214
 start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

318
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:52,246
 china shop, you can behave any way.

319
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:56,220
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

320
00:23:56,245 --> 00:24:00,455
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

321
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:05,802
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

322
00:24:06,636 --> 00:24:12,339
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

323
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:20,127
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

324
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:26,652
So, actually it is not a dharma
 that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

325
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:31,624
It is something very low to be angry with others,

326
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,903
 to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

327
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:42,227
 or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

328
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:44,134
And this doesn’t pay.

329
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:47,889
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

330
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:51,429
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

331
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:57,541
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

332
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,657
you think no end of yourself

333
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:04,803
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

334
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:08,032
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

335
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:11,576
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

336
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:14,264
 "I did this, I did this, I went there.

337
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,409
I, I, I…"

338
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:24,290
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

339
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:31,806
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

340
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:38,726
 funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

341
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:45,956
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
 somebody says that

342
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,453
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

343
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:54,618
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

344
00:25:55,062 --> 00:26:01,532
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

345
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:07,309
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

346
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:11,382
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

347
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:18,765
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

348
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:24,060
 and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

349
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:27,112
Not for others so much as for yourself,

350
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:31,501
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

351
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:37,818
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

352
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:44,289
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

353
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:49,797
You better be religious, so what?

354
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:52,075
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

355
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:56,688
 you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

356
00:26:56,713 --> 00:27:02,124
 all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

357
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:06,827
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

358
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:11,791
 you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

359
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:17,553
 you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

360
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:25,236
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

361
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,140
You just see yourself.

362
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:32,208
What happens, how you behave

363
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:38,502
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

364
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:40,644
It’s very sweet.

365
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:45,314
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

366
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:48,393
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

367
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:55,235
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

368
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,589
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

369
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,579
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

370
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:07,582
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

371
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:12,316
 like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

372
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:16,395
So if somebody tries to be funny,

373
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,086
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

374
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:23,370
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

375
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:27,800
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

376
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:30,000
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

377
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,204
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

378
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:37,368
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

379
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:41,263
But now it has become such a common practice,

380
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,041
and we know that he will just now come along

381
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,237
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

382
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:53,837
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

383
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:58,922
which has been going through the different types of

384
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:06,167
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

385
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,288
 that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

386
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:18,863
 because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

387
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:23,448
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

388
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:30,101
 that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

389
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:35,171
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

390
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:38,179
when you have no authority,

391
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:42,135
 when you have nothing to do with that person.

392
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:46,649
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

393
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:50,906
has been made into the minds of human beings,

394
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:55,514
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

395
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:59,248
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

396
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,779
 maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

397
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:08,928
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

398
00:30:09,294 --> 00:30:15,930
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

399
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:21,166
And what happens to you, that you become

400
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:26,833
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

401
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:31,395
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

402
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,950
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

403
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:39,284
Just it happens,

404
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:42,843
 though you are brought up the same way as others are,

405
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:46,930
 though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

406
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:54,335
 but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

407
00:30:56,333 --> 00:31:00,631
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

408
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:05,641
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

409
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,029
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

410
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:12,977
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

411
00:31:13,295 --> 00:31:16,715
how you are enjoying the company of others,
  it’s very remarkable;

412
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:22,333
 and that has come because your heart is full of joy

413
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:25,055
of the Spirit that shines within you.

414
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:28,487
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

415
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:32,042
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

416
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:35,230
There are some people who think no end of themself,

417
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:38,905
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

418
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,578
They are not enjoying.

419
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:43,735
They still think that they are something great,

420
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:47,845
so they must stay somewhere like that.

421
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:50,932
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

422
00:31:50,957 --> 00:31:56,776
 when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

423
00:31:56,902 --> 00:32:01,252
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

424
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,780
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

425
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:08,264
with attached bath,  this, that;

426
00:32:09,504 --> 00:32:12,211
 young people, it’s very surprising.

427
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:16,242
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

428
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,641
 or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

429
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,544
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

430
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:32,106
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

431
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,388
That is the One that gives you happiness.

432
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:41,863
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

433
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:48,610
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

434
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:51,600
If you want to know about the Christians,

435
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:54,667
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

436
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:58,698
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

437
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:03,002
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

438
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,479
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

439
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:10,826
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

440
00:33:10,874 --> 00:33:16,010
So this whole attitude changes completely.

441
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:21,262
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

442
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:27,007
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

443
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,311
They become just one with each other.

444
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:34,766
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

445
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,304
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

446
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:42,603
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

447
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:47,689
 that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

448
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,638
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

449
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:55,656
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

450
00:33:55,736 --> 00:34:00,161
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

451
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:05,350
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

452
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:13,766
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

453
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:20,277
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

454
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:23,690
If the drop is outside the ocean,

455
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:27,625
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

456
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:32,196
 he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

457
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:35,771
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

458
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:39,940
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

459
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:45,914
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

460
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:50,333
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

461
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:53,185
 you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

462
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,756
 because you are the Spirit.

463
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:59,074
Now you should be on the watch

464
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:04,949
about yourself sometimes,
 and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

465
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,466
 how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

466
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:15,380
So many problems come in the West because

467
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:20,193
 they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

468
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:25,858
Because even an old man of eighty years

469
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:31,239
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

470
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,720
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

471
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:39,673
because he doesn’t accept his age,

472
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,630
 he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

473
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:51,892
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

474
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,616
This is more common in the West.

475
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:56,381
They always think like that.

476
00:35:56,406 --> 00:36:00,085
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

477
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:05,576
They may be just on their way to the grave,

478
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:09,312
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

479
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,599
This is the problem of the West.

480
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:13,438
Now how does it come?

481
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:18,502
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

482
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,217
and to be old is to be proud.

483
00:36:21,242 --> 00:36:23,840
Now when I was five years,

484
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:28,883
 I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

485
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:32,483
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

486
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:38,146
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

487
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:42,455
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

488
00:36:42,638 --> 00:36:46,482
 if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

489
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:48,893
then of course nobody can help.

490
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:54,339
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

491
00:36:54,514 --> 00:36:59,806
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

492
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,118
 divorcing your wife and this, that.

493
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,416
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

494
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:09,377
they don’t have much respect for the women.

495
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:14,202
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

496
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:19,349
 supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

497
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:23,774
 and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

498
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:27,436
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

499
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:33,247
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

500
00:37:34,057 --> 00:37:35,725
that a woman should be beaten up.

501
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,020
I mean, who is this poet?

502
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,220
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

503
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:46,166
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

504
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:51,527
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

505
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:54,257
 which is absolutely absurd.

506
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:58,770
This comes because you are not wise.

507
00:37:59,098 --> 00:38:04,125
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

508
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,266
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

509
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:12,374
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

510
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:16,610
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

511
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,892
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

512
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:25,559
 useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

513
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:34,773
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

514
00:38:35,242 --> 00:38:38,813
and you justify it, all that you justify

515
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:41,150
 and you say, "Now this is very good.

516
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:43,501
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

517
00:38:43,526 --> 00:38:48,492
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

518
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:52,061
"Whatever I am doing is good.

519
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:55,006
Whatever is my attitude is good.

520
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:59,941
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

521
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,980
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

522
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,640
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

523
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:11,810
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

524
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:16,872
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

525
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:21,109
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

526
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:26,285
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

527
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,148
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

528
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:32,999
 or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

529
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:36,925
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

530
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,051
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

531
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:46,237
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

532
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:49,007
where you become the Spirit.

533
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:52,394
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

534
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,157
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

535
00:39:56,271 --> 00:40:00,857
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

536
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:06,541
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

537
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:12,088
 such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

538
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:16,536
 that you overcome the ego of others.

539
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:18,415
I must tell you a story.

540
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,978
Once I went to see a saint.

541
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,380
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

542
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:26,644
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

543
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,035
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

544
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,559
So we had to climb a lot.

545
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:32,536
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

546
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,182
First you see his vibrations.”

547
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:37,327
So lots of vibrations were coming.

548
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:41,593
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

549
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:46,641
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

550
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:52,812
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

551
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:58,069
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

552
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,705
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

553
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,263
 just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

554
00:41:05,748 --> 00:41:08,631
So I went into his cave and sat down.

555
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:14,678
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

556
00:41:14,703 --> 00:41:19,728
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

557
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:23,144
Is it to overcome my ego?"

558
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:27,318
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

559
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:32,038
 I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

560
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:35,731
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

561
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:37,396
you bought a sari for Me.

562
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:41,999
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
 I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

563
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:47,481
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

564
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:51,706
And the whole thing melted away.

565
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,829
He became a very different person.

566
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:59,907
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

567
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:06,881
You say things by which you melt their ego.

568
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:16,495
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

569
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:23,697
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

570
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,348
 I should say, your Spirit.

571
00:42:26,554 --> 00:42:33,487
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

572
00:42:33,526 --> 00:42:38,810
 but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

573
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:48,068
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

574
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:55,386
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

575
00:42:55,528 --> 00:43:00,306
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

576
00:43:00,362 --> 00:43:05,905
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

577
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,489
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

578
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,675
 so they have to be disciplined.”

579
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,862
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

580
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:18,509
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

581
00:43:18,613 --> 00:43:21,225
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

582
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,079
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

583
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,404
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

584
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:29,993
You don’t have to worry on that point."

585
00:43:30,018 --> 00:43:33,005
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

586
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,510
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

587
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:40,085
The reason is, you are realized souls,

588
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,838
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

589
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:50,787
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

590
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,779
I don’t have to tell you.

591
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:57,367
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

592
00:43:57,407 --> 00:44:00,278
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

593
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:03,223
 or anything, and how did they do it?

594
00:44:03,248 --> 00:44:07,884
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

595
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:10,198
 is the light of the Spirit.

596
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:13,536
You become absolutely independent

597
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:17,544
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

598
00:44:17,592 --> 00:44:20,093
because you have the light.

599
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:25,874
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

600
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:31,380
Supposing now there is light,

601
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,436
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

602
00:44:37,663 --> 00:44:40,711
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

603
00:44:40,782 --> 00:44:45,425
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

604
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:50,510
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

605
00:44:50,836 --> 00:44:55,383
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

606
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:03,650
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

607
00:45:04,252 --> 00:45:06,556
You are not slave of anything.

608
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:10,326
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

609
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:15,487
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

610
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:20,890
You don’t want to see whether 
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

611
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:28,986
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things, 
so you are gunatit.

612
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:33,642
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

613
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:38,348
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

614
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:44,382
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams 
they are very strict.

615
00:45:44,612 --> 00:45:45,825
That should not be so.

616
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,157
I have told them never to be strict.

617
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:52,536
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

618
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:54,839
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

619
00:45:54,914 --> 00:45:58,773
After some time he himself will get up at four,

620
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:01,668
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

621
00:46:01,787 --> 00:46:04,807
Children also you should not discipline too much.

622
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:09,801
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

623
00:46:09,826 --> 00:46:11,298
 they are so beautiful.

624
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:14,478
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

625
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:18,105
Once you realize that those who are not realized

626
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:22,461
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

627
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:26,197
 your attitude towards them will change.

628
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:30,886
You will just try to be extremely patient

629
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:35,338
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

630
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:38,535
because you will know that person is not realized.

631
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:43,320
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

632
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:49,112
 he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

633
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,874
So first let him feel the reality.

634
00:46:51,899 --> 00:46:55,012
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

635
00:46:55,037 --> 00:47:00,217
Still he’ll go on making mistakes 
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

636
00:47:00,242 --> 00:47:02,556
So this is what you have achieved

637
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:07,581
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

638
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:12,076
And you become a person of a temperament

639
00:47:12,148 --> 00:47:18,012
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

640
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:23,704
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga 
which has happened,

641
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:28,583
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

642
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:32,564
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

643
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:38,235
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

644
00:47:38,347 --> 00:47:43,594
 but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,  
as I told you yesterday,

645
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,846
 that these people went to Israel,

646
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:49,340
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

647
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:50,349
Who told them?

648
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:52,725
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

649
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,291
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

650
00:47:56,316 --> 00:48:01,850
 and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

651
00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:07,650
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

652
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:12,546
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

653
00:48:28,064 --> 00:48:33,366
 they are very remarkably, very picturesque

654
00:48:33,391 --> 00:48:39,053
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

655
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:43,289
In everything I see your love.

656
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,741
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

657
00:48:47,876 --> 00:48:53,344
I feel My children are so loving.

658
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:58,802
I have done nothing for you, 
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

659
00:48:58,945 --> 00:49:01,450
I still want to know, what have I done?

660
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:02,981
I have done nothing!

661
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,051
But the way you want to express your love,

662
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:10,538
 it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

663
00:49:10,563 --> 00:49:15,223
that you got the light of your Spirit.

664
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:20,375
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

665
00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:28,169
 but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

666
00:49:28,295 --> 00:49:31,190
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

667
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:33,945
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

668
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,050
It’s a fact.

669
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:39,013
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

670
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:42,596
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

671
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:47,782
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

672
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:50,623
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

673
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:56,981
and you don’t understand that 
normally is not done like this anywhere;

674
00:49:57,076 --> 00:50:03,000
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
 their beautiful love.

675
00:50:03,442 --> 00:50:08,594
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

676
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:14,301
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

677
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:19,878
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

678
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:22,121
How could you manage that?

679
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:29,687
It’s not easy to understand,
 it’s not for human beings to see that.

680
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:34,157
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

681
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:38,536
and why are they living like this so happily?

682
00:50:38,987 --> 00:50:44,437
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

683
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:47,691
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

684
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:50,481
 it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

685
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,487
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

686
00:50:53,512 --> 00:50:56,645
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

687
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:58,780
 you don’t care for anything.

688
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:03,961
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

689
00:51:04,112 --> 00:51:07,484
without any expectation, without any criticism,

690
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:12,529
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

691
00:51:12,561 --> 00:51:16,816
And even when you pull each other’s legs, 
you know, I enjoy your jokes

692
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:23,516
and understand that it’s such friendship, 
such beautiful friendship.

693
00:51:23,634 --> 00:51:30,137
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

694
00:51:30,162 --> 00:51:34,317
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

695
00:51:34,421 --> 00:51:40,568
 oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

696
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:44,223
 and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

697
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:52,406
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is 
what one has to achieve for others also.

698
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:58,153
For that also, must remember that
 you have the light; others don’t have.

699
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:03,633
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

700
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:08,504
about their problem, and just listen to them.

701
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,917
What is their problem?

702
00:52:09,942 --> 00:52:14,809
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

703
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:19,968
 or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

704
00:52:20,047 --> 00:52:24,814
 or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

705
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:27,350
All kinds of things they might tell you.

706
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:31,713
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

707
00:52:31,738 --> 00:52:37,971
After that you will find gradually, you see,
 they’ll soothe down

708
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:43,418
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

709
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:50,078
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

710
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:52,757
You have those powers.

711
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,332
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

712
00:52:57,357 --> 00:52:59,979
you can create happiness in that place.

713
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:06,384
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

714
00:53:06,535 --> 00:53:13,627
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

715
00:53:13,652 --> 00:53:18,338
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

716
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:21,653
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

717
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:25,553
they are not mad people, 
 they are not after some sort of a craze -

718
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:29,986
just very, very balanced people."

719
00:53:30,402 --> 00:53:32,775
And this you don’t have to practice.

720
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,095
It is there.

721
00:53:34,134 --> 00:53:37,445
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

722
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:43,144
You should not think that it is something

723
00:53:43,232 --> 00:53:48,506
that you have to achieve, or to become.

724
00:53:48,531 --> 00:53:51,254
You have it, within yourself you have it.

725
00:53:51,279 --> 00:53:56,899
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

726
00:53:58,287 --> 00:54:03,610
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

727
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:08,379
It is not easy for others to understand you,

728
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:11,570
but it should be very easy to understand them;

729
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:14,505
because you were like that before,

730
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:21,849
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

731
00:54:22,724 --> 00:54:24,291
It’s very simple.

732
00:54:24,316 --> 00:54:28,915
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

733
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,378
And now today, see how many are there.

734
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:34,819
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

735
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:36,891
I have no idea.

736
00:54:36,924 --> 00:54:41,396
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

737
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,046
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

738
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:50,818
 you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

739
00:54:50,866 --> 00:54:56,086
 of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

740
00:54:56,322 --> 00:55:01,693
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

741
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:08,408
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

742
00:55:08,868 --> 00:58:01,679
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
