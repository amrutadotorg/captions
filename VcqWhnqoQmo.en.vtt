WEBVTT

00:03.010 --> 00:09.420
We had a very good session I should say and they're very successful

00:12.280 --> 00:16.469
In Portugal and even better in Spain

00:22.119 --> 00:24.179
Portugal is a place where

00:25.539 --> 00:27.629
Gurus have touched to him nicely

00:29.380 --> 00:32.279
Because people are too simple I think and

00:34.239 --> 00:38.339
Because they are too simple they're affected too hard and

00:39.670 --> 00:41.350
I

00:41.350 --> 00:43.350
Was really confronted

00:43.660 --> 00:47.219
With so many sick people there who have been to gurus

00:48.250 --> 00:50.250
Who have been only four to three?

00:51.579 --> 00:53.579
Thanking to three

00:56.320 --> 01:00.599
Years with them not badly affected and

01:05.409 --> 01:08.879
Surprisingly how the whole thing is exposed

01:11.380 --> 01:13.380
That we may be able to do

01:16.210 --> 01:18.210
Much better

01:20.770 --> 01:22.770
In Portugal

01:24.479 --> 01:26.479
Now the

01:29.400 --> 01:31.400
Portuguese people

01:32.820 --> 01:34.820
Get lot of wine

01:34.860 --> 01:36.860
In a drink a lot

01:36.869 --> 01:41.989
They really drink. I mean they have all kinds of wines in their countries a very big problem of that places

01:41.990 --> 01:45.710
It has many wines and I think the drunkenness

01:48.420 --> 01:50.420
Make them extremely lethargic

01:51.780 --> 01:55.489
And that with hardly brought down that Empire

01:56.670 --> 02:00.110
You can see it's a very huge place. I mean the

02:01.409 --> 02:08.359
building's if you see are very beautifully done lots of buildings with lots of architecture and

02:11.850 --> 02:13.850
All that

02:14.190 --> 02:16.190
Is like a desolate place

02:17.130 --> 02:20.539
the reason is the people who we're

02:23.400 --> 02:27.110
At the time quite affluent were doing well gradually

02:28.380 --> 02:30.380
unemployment started settling down

02:31.769 --> 02:36.349
Lots of strides just the same thing as I feel it's happening in this country and

02:37.709 --> 02:39.709
unemployment

02:40.109 --> 02:41.640
And

02:41.640 --> 02:45.949
Amounting to establish first days to get doles and all that as we get yet

02:46.650 --> 02:48.359
Gradually, it stopped

02:48.359 --> 02:52.369
Now it's so bad that all of them have to depend on their parents. There's no way

02:53.010 --> 02:55.010
They have no source of income

02:56.130 --> 03:00.409
Very few industries. It's one of the poorest

03:01.769 --> 03:04.309
country in the whole of Europe

03:06.950 --> 03:09.619
That made me think about in here

03:11.970 --> 03:13.970
But we have to

03:14.340 --> 03:16.550
know that

03:18.030 --> 03:24.140
This country also may face a face if we do not get up now

03:26.310 --> 03:31.339
You see it's alright to never do that attention to Falkland and all that, but it cannot feed you

03:33.150 --> 03:40.039
So we have to understand all the sahaja Yogi's must understand that they all must have some sort of affair

03:41.130 --> 03:43.130
Degree or something on the paper?

03:43.650 --> 03:45.650
That's a very important

03:46.769 --> 03:49.699
And though you are all realized Souls and

03:50.310 --> 03:53.600
You are spiritually so and doubt everything is there

03:54.180 --> 03:56.810
But you have to think of the whole if the country

03:57.390 --> 04:00.410
completely goes down in its production and

04:01.739 --> 04:05.629
Its capacity to activate itself. You will go down T

04:07.110 --> 04:09.110
so your attention should be

04:09.239 --> 04:10.320
now

04:10.320 --> 04:12.320
Of course, you should not be materialistic

04:12.750 --> 04:17.690
But towards putting more activity into you even in sahaja yoga in meditating

04:18.329 --> 04:22.009
In working it out in yourself. So the authority is not going to be

04:24.600 --> 04:29.570
And this is one thing is such an inertia such an inertia that exists

04:30.930 --> 04:37.250
That unless and until really put in complete willpower this inertia may not be combat

04:37.250 --> 04:39.250
It may be very difficult

04:41.700 --> 04:44.839
Of a very dangerous time and means

04:45.990 --> 04:48.740
You have to really be patriotic about it

04:49.500 --> 04:51.500
And you to think about it

04:53.160 --> 04:58.549
After all you are symbols of the English people

04:59.970 --> 05:03.229
Whatever works out in you will start working out in the rest

05:05.010 --> 05:07.099
So how you behave towards yourself

05:08.550 --> 05:14.450
And towards the general atmosphere is very very important

05:19.199 --> 05:23.209
Towards sahaja yoga. Also the attitude has to be understood very clearly

05:26.639 --> 05:28.639
You see like a

05:29.310 --> 05:36.530
Maharaja in India who lives in quite give it comfort. First of all lives like a lord and he orders about to see

05:37.349 --> 05:39.349
And then everything is lost

05:39.900 --> 05:43.099
But still he talks like a lord. He behaves like a lord

05:43.770 --> 05:46.039
His whole thing is the same way

05:47.190 --> 05:54.829
though it's not that the kingdom is there that he's the ruler but he's talked like that to everyone because the habits are for I

05:55.560 --> 05:58.039
Think the mind also has formed a habit the whole atmosphere

05:59.520 --> 06:02.659
Its charged with such ego since law

06:04.199 --> 06:08.029
And that's why towards sahaja yoga also the attitude has to be

06:08.699 --> 06:10.699
humbler much

06:10.800 --> 06:16.039
Because without humility you cannot that's one thing you must understand. It's no question of

06:16.650 --> 06:19.789
You rationally saying something about it or explain it, you know

06:19.789 --> 06:25.968
Yeah, but but you see basically one has to be extremely humble. First of all, it's a very big privilege

06:26.699 --> 06:29.149
To get realization, you know

06:30.120 --> 06:32.120
it's a greater privilege to

06:33.509 --> 06:35.658
Is the greatest to be a sahaja yogi?

06:36.000 --> 06:43.339
It is a very great privilege that you have which very few people and you are the ones who are chosen specially

06:44.280 --> 06:49.489
But the humility part of it is still missing about sahaja yoga about self

06:54.509 --> 07:02.179
Like we should ask make me better sahaja yoga a humbler sahaja yoga a

07:05.669 --> 07:09.499
Compassionate sahaja, yoga a sweeter sahaja yogi dissolved my

07:12.930 --> 07:19.190
This is very important we must understand because whatever works out in you will work out in this country

07:21.780 --> 07:24.049
Baragas is something

07:26.310 --> 07:31.849
That with ego you can never understand you have another one the way you talk to others the way you behave towards others

07:33.120 --> 07:38.329
You will never understand because there is he if you are standing in the darkness

07:40.530 --> 07:45.440
The light is there but it is covered with something how will you understand where is the light

07:48.870 --> 07:54.019
So humidity must be there because you people have very developed brains

07:54.539 --> 08:00.619
Very develop develop grace and that great can see always tell you. Ah,

08:01.050 --> 08:03.469
better than I've ever you say always the

08:04.289 --> 08:09.589
Another one is no good. And the third one is useless. See you're the best

08:10.319 --> 08:12.649
That's typical of the brain teachings

08:13.229 --> 08:20.059
And when it starts working out, it's very difficult. You see to see that the one who is saying this, you know, where?

08:22.530 --> 08:26.179
Because from the point where you see you cannot see what you are saying

08:30.840 --> 08:34.310
What you see is the whole thing as if you

08:35.579 --> 08:38.689
Have to command it you have to ask for it

08:40.680 --> 08:43.130
Of course the quality is very much changing now

08:43.469 --> 08:50.929
Everybody is becoming very very very sweet and sober and nobody now demands anything from me like you must give me this mother you have

08:50.930 --> 08:53.000
To do it. You have to look after me after all

08:53.000 --> 09:00.169
I have been to your Caxton Hall once to see and how dare you do not look after my mother when she met an accident

09:01.380 --> 09:03.380
Something like that that's over now

09:04.470 --> 09:06.470
that's

09:10.110 --> 09:17.330
The quality is improving I when I started learning now how to laugh at your own ego and listener

09:19.140 --> 09:26.179
But I personally think that one has to realize that if you represent this country to your mother

09:28.200 --> 09:30.200
Then it has to improve State

09:31.050 --> 09:35.840
still I have to improve and I have to go ahead I have to go further with it and

09:36.660 --> 09:38.660
I have to develop

09:38.940 --> 09:40.940
that

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
Beauty of

09:47.100 --> 09:48.570
Humility

09:48.570 --> 09:53.960
Like in Portugal they told me Lord Bryden who might think to be a useless fellow absolutely

09:54.150 --> 09:57.919
Good-for-nothing and I regretted every minute why he was created on this earth

09:59.250 --> 10:03.020
He went and said that he went and said

10:04.620 --> 10:08.960
Sintra is a very beautiful place Sintra is too good to be wasted on Portuguese

10:10.830 --> 10:14.150
It should have been for mr. Lord Byron - so every maybe

10:18.360 --> 10:23.660
And it pinches everyone, you know everybody feels but think if you are the person about whom you said

10:34.230 --> 10:39.830
So one has to develop a kind of a humility that I have to still receive come forward

10:39.990 --> 10:43.400
I have to still get it. It has to work out

10:44.820 --> 10:49.669
Now when it comes to that kind of an attitude, then it turned wrong

10:50.820 --> 10:54.530
Turn down upon yourself. What have you done for? Sahaja yoga

10:55.440 --> 10:57.440
one punch

10:59.580 --> 11:03.919
Simple what have you done for sahaja yoga

11:13.820 --> 11:16.179
How many people have you given realization

11:20.060 --> 11:22.239
How many people have you been able to hear

11:26.240 --> 11:28.479
How much peace have you got within yourself

11:30.110 --> 11:34.839
How much blissful are you how much compassion have we won?

11:36.770 --> 11:39.489
How much forgiveness and patience you have for others

11:40.880 --> 11:42.880
How much of sharing you can do?

11:46.130 --> 11:48.130
These are the signs of sahaja Yogi's that

11:53.570 --> 11:56.979
You break your shell you become the collective

11:59.570 --> 12:01.570
How much we understand others

12:02.660 --> 12:05.500
And how much do you understand giving others?

12:07.250 --> 12:10.450
What have you given to others even on material level let's see

12:18.740 --> 12:23.409
These questions should be put to yourself on a very material level

12:23.410 --> 12:28.180
These questions have to be asked on a very material level because the light comes down upto material

12:31.520 --> 12:33.520
How many people who can forgive

12:38.000 --> 12:42.789
You are realized so your profits no doubt you can make others prophets

12:44.839 --> 12:46.929
But you have to be the quality ocean

12:51.560 --> 12:56.890
The quality of a prophet is his nobility he's so noble

13:00.050 --> 13:02.050
Nobleness

13:02.329 --> 13:05.859
In comparison with other people who are not realized Souls

13:07.190 --> 13:09.190
He is nobler

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
He is more dignified

13:15.710 --> 13:22.239
He is much more forgiving so the whole way of dealing with others will change

13:25.490 --> 13:27.490
He is obedient

13:37.430 --> 13:39.910
For our we have to obey our good way

13:43.580 --> 13:47.859
Otherwise you are difficult people. It's impossible. Nobody can do anything

13:51.320 --> 13:54.189
If you are like a thorn, how can anybody help?

13:56.330 --> 14:01.540
So the quality of a sahaja yogi is measured by another kind of a measure

14:02.090 --> 14:09.759
This is not the way human beings measure the quality of other human beings like somebody has a good taste for example so far

14:12.920 --> 14:16.659
Then peoples are always great for the booty, so did he had the big paw?

14:19.250 --> 14:24.250
Paw he talks like that or he walks like that or says they start and all those things

14:25.760 --> 14:29.979
Or a question like this, why did you say like that all these words you know that

14:30.530 --> 14:37.329
Very hard - why do you do like that? This is kind of a language itself was not there in this English life

14:38.210 --> 14:40.720
Nowadays, the language is so changed and very rude

14:41.750 --> 14:43.750
very arrogant and

14:44.120 --> 14:46.120
very harmful

14:48.890 --> 14:50.890
So first ask yourself

14:52.610 --> 14:58.150
Because sahaja yoga will spread of course slowly and steadily I hope

14:59.750 --> 15:06.970
Only through your images you are the reflectors you put my thousands of posters

15:09.230 --> 15:11.230
I'm so unique, you know

15:11.930 --> 15:15.250
They say all right. This unique personality is big enough

15:16.190 --> 15:17.540
no, but

15:17.540 --> 15:19.540
What about the deciders?

15:25.850 --> 15:30.010
So actually whatever is in the lower level

15:31.070 --> 15:34.869
Animals is important right in lower level animals

15:35.090 --> 15:42.939
The king is the one say the tiger has to kill an animal big animal it is he only can kill

15:44.600 --> 15:51.190
Til humans tell you also perhaps it is the one who can really dominate others survival of the fittest

15:52.490 --> 15:56.530
Is the rule is the other way around it's changed completely

16:02.840 --> 16:05.019
How much free you are in your ideas

16:05.810 --> 16:09.489
Or you are still identified with old ideas?

16:10.280 --> 16:13.239
But free doesn't mean abandonment by in each other

16:15.740 --> 16:17.060
Freedom

16:17.060 --> 16:23.049
Means you respect the freedom of others first and foremost thing of freedom is that you must respect the freedom of others

16:23.630 --> 16:25.689
Even God respects your freedom

16:26.360 --> 16:30.219
He cannot give you realization if you don't want you cannot force it

16:31.400 --> 16:34.900
So respect the freedom of others, but that does not mean

16:36.020 --> 16:39.009
While respecting the freedom of others, there should be abundantly

16:40.940 --> 16:46.510
If somebody is abundant in in sahaja yoga, he goes out of the circulation of sahaja yoga

16:47.150 --> 16:50.109
It's not coming in so important. I have told you hundred times

16:53.240 --> 16:55.539
It's throwing out part of it you see

16:56.240 --> 16:58.719
Sometimes I feel I should give you some clothes to sticker

16:59.780 --> 17:00.950
maybe

17:00.950 --> 17:03.549
the we can turn very fast and some of

17:04.400 --> 17:06.999
half takes may be thrown out back coming into the

17:08.360 --> 17:10.360
oven

17:10.490 --> 17:12.490
So I

17:13.520 --> 17:20.079
Feel in these countries when I went Spain they call it Spain still half developing Portugal developing

17:23.800 --> 17:24.620
I

17:24.620 --> 17:29.109
don't know what you think about Italy whatever it is called very humble, very

17:29.870 --> 17:32.650
humble from the very first day

17:33.290 --> 17:35.290
anyone

17:35.450 --> 17:41.349
Who comes from the very first day they are very humble and because they are number they are sensitive to me

17:44.330 --> 17:48.549
Because you have to be really very humble to be sensitive, that's a fact

17:49.250 --> 17:55.330
Because I'm too simple not even as if I do not understand anything. I

17:58.430 --> 18:00.430
Look like that

18:02.630 --> 18:05.530
As if I have no knowledge of anything

18:06.650 --> 18:08.950
Very simple woman talks in a very simple way

18:09.980 --> 18:12.160
He's very friendly and all right

18:15.110 --> 18:18.610
So to understand me you have to be extremely humble

18:22.610 --> 18:27.640
And if you cannot go to that level of humanity you cannot see

18:31.400 --> 18:33.400
And you cannot understand

18:34.850 --> 18:40.270
And the more you start understanding the more humble young people naturally because you know what it is

18:44.150 --> 18:50.680
So I have told you many times about humility part of it but my experience of these countries was where I went there I mean

18:51.470 --> 18:53.770
They are very humble. Very humble

18:56.450 --> 19:03.549
About sahaja yoga extremely even the new people were very humble

19:06.470 --> 19:11.680
Spanish people same thing extremely humble. You see Don had told me that there. Were you go over

19:12.230 --> 19:13.340
bullfighter

19:13.340 --> 19:17.260
But the one who came this time, they're so humble. I was amazed

19:18.830 --> 19:24.339
Even if I could touch them that was sufficient for me. Nobody pulled my hand nothing

19:32.320 --> 19:34.320
So this is what it is one has to

19:35.289 --> 19:37.738
Understand that we have certain tags

19:38.860 --> 19:40.860
of our past

19:43.450 --> 19:45.450
Which has to vote on

19:46.090 --> 19:51.569
The language should be extremely common language. Try to read I

19:55.779 --> 19:57.779
Don't know whose language is so humble

20:00.429 --> 20:02.518
Maybe mine, I don't know

20:03.399 --> 20:10.409
But try to read books where people speak humble language humble way of talking

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
We'll enjoy it

20:13.869 --> 20:15.869
Really enjoy

20:16.269 --> 20:18.358
Humility is the glory of sahaja Yogi's

20:18.999 --> 20:21.539
It's the only way they will grow

20:22.239 --> 20:26.069
It's like putting your roots down and down and down

20:35.919 --> 20:37.919
The

20:40.269 --> 20:46.709
People who went from here where themselves amazed at the humility of the people who were there very much amazed

20:47.799 --> 20:50.579
the way things are working out there the way they

20:51.639 --> 20:53.939
helped us and did everything for us and

20:56.289 --> 20:59.189
I'm sure now in Spain. We'll have a very nice

21:00.340 --> 21:06.720
Very very nice Center. Of course, the Ambassador is a very very humble man, you know him too humble

21:07.509 --> 21:11.248
And he might be coming here and one day I want to call him here to the ashram

21:11.320 --> 21:13.439
Also, he and his wife will be here

21:13.960 --> 21:21.119
so the ambassador was very sweet and he called to me to his house in write it and in a

21:21.639 --> 21:27.959
Kinda nice tea party called Indians and everything and Indians where you know, they asked me for one thing. It will be shocking

21:28.570 --> 21:30.570
They said what about something to?

21:31.359 --> 21:36.539
Depend upon see can we have your photographs something must be having some vibrations?

21:37.130 --> 21:39.669
Should we use her photographs for our version?

21:44.750 --> 21:49.270
And the first time said that it's alright it will work out too like I didn't want to say it to take my photograph

21:49.580 --> 21:55.630
So she was so disappointed the lady she said no, there must be a photographs or something which we can use after all, okay

21:56.750 --> 22:02.409
And here first thing comes up like a big snake why mother's photograph?

22:03.650 --> 22:06.129
She should give us the elaboration she should

22:08.210 --> 22:14.559
She should solve our problems all our sickness everything but why have photograph this is too much

22:18.140 --> 22:22.689
In this you can see the ego of the people

22:41.929 --> 22:48.249
Now regarding our show I had asked me I had asked him to make certain rules of English

22:51.080 --> 22:52.220
I

22:52.220 --> 22:54.220
must say that

22:54.320 --> 23:01.360
Of course. Nick should say things as you somebody told me that he should have been using softer with it and although

23:03.440 --> 23:06.460
But supposing somebody is not soft at all so

23:07.760 --> 23:11.619
You must know that is he sent by mother and you must be

23:13.159 --> 23:15.159
You see actually when you say no to him

23:15.159 --> 23:18.729
We are saying no to me on so isn't because I sent him I told

23:18.950 --> 23:23.020
And I told him that you must carry out these things if you do not allow him to carry out

23:23.929 --> 23:29.439
He has to mean cannot strict. My softer means supposing something fails then what to do

23:33.409 --> 23:37.149
But I I really don't know after realization even if you

23:38.390 --> 23:42.609
Do not do things. What should we do? Then? He suggested I

23:45.530 --> 23:52.509
Mean you should respect everyone but say even if you respect people get a potato clock in the morning then what should you do?

23:57.169 --> 23:59.889
What should be done you just tell John

24:03.740 --> 24:06.159
I mean, it is really surprising

24:06.919 --> 24:11.499
You are not prophets. Do you understand your quality? What are you whatever you know?

24:12.590 --> 24:16.959
Then what should we do about you? See these are so simple things like children

24:16.960 --> 24:23.439
Also, if you are in a hostel you are made to get up in the morning. Take your bag. Get ready. I mean

24:24.350 --> 24:26.350
If you do not listen

24:26.690 --> 24:28.870
anyone a very simple

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
Then what should one do with

24:36.769 --> 24:38.769
You just had

24:40.969 --> 24:42.969
This is not the problem in Australia

24:44.839 --> 24:47.319
But English one I'm going to Australia eight problems

24:47.929 --> 24:49.249
have see

24:49.249 --> 24:50.269
Sally

24:50.269 --> 24:52.190
What a problem Bob

24:52.190 --> 24:57.039
You could see in forecast her ego absolutely in contrast. I could see L clearly

25:00.440 --> 25:04.209
Though she said that she was in uh what her place she was him

25:04.209 --> 25:08.379
Yes, Jesse, and they are boots got her, but all the boots

25:09.469 --> 25:11.469
Mystical that's the point

25:13.729 --> 25:15.729
Such a contrast, you know

25:19.219 --> 25:23.229
If we have to move as one button and you are enlightened

25:24.019 --> 25:29.978
Parson part part and parcel particle of the same body supposing this finger says no. No, I will not reach

25:30.919 --> 25:32.949
now somebody is say

25:33.979 --> 25:35.979
putting a

25:36.019 --> 25:38.019
big

25:38.359 --> 25:44.109
Attack or something and this hand says no, I will not work out there what to do

25:46.639 --> 25:48.639
Actually, it's a very big

25:49.219 --> 25:50.989
Dilemma for me

25:50.989 --> 25:54.578
Because a hand which is forced to do it will never do it properly

25:55.159 --> 25:58.838
If you don't force it, then what happens together, I mean just see these

26:01.759 --> 26:03.759
Diligence is very important

26:05.719 --> 26:07.719
We should not take things for granted

26:12.229 --> 26:14.229
You see

26:14.570 --> 26:21.039
We take now oneself for granted everything for granted is not problem we have to work hard

26:23.599 --> 26:28.029
We have to work it out ourselves you see even if you have ten thousand sahaja Yogi's they

26:30.379 --> 26:32.858
The quality is so poor there, isn't it?

26:33.769 --> 26:36.699
You have to get up in the morning do it meditation

26:36.700 --> 26:42.700
You have to grow you have to grow still much more and you know, you are so very few. I have to use you only

26:46.700 --> 26:53.019
Of course nobody can force you and even if you for a forced labor is not going to help you sell yoga

26:53.019 --> 26:55.019
that is you take it from it cannot

26:56.029 --> 26:58.419
So these people are moved where and where do they stand?

26:59.720 --> 27:03.490
Now anyone you tell the job say Warren was in Australia?

27:04.309 --> 27:07.028
There was jealousies about it terrible jealousies

27:08.029 --> 27:10.029
Why should he tell me?

27:10.639 --> 27:13.359
Because there's nobody to tell you within your circle

27:14.269 --> 27:16.269
That's the problem is it?

27:16.610 --> 27:20.529
So that which is sleeping I put it into one man. All right this management

27:21.710 --> 27:25.299
But then that person tells you then people feel jealous

27:28.580 --> 27:30.610
A profit is never jealous

27:32.389 --> 27:38.679
Because he knows he has achieved his powers now, he's in his own power and his power is of surrendering

27:39.799 --> 27:43.839
It is not about powering you see you cannot see the other side of it

27:43.840 --> 27:46.120
You think power means you sit on somebody's head?

27:46.120 --> 27:50.799
then I am very powerful like a woman if she can make her husband dance to her tune then she thinks how

27:50.929 --> 27:54.339
I'm the most powerful woman ever living is the other way not

27:56.960 --> 28:00.819
That the woman is so loving that husband cannot do without that sort of a power

28:03.830 --> 28:10.840
She's so sweet that the husband cannot manage without her that sort of a power it should be the power of a prophet

28:15.500 --> 28:22.209
And these things are very much deeply put into us so face it up a dicta

28:25.039 --> 28:30.398
Whole value system is upside down. I tell you the whole value system is upside down

28:35.419 --> 28:37.419
See my life own life

28:39.559 --> 28:45.609
As a wife of such and such and such I am expected to go into diamond shops buy diamonds

28:46.370 --> 28:47.629
well

28:47.629 --> 28:49.629
Become a big lady

28:51.259 --> 28:54.429
Heels like that and walked with a neck like that. I

28:55.159 --> 28:57.189
Do all sorts. This is the normal

28:57.929 --> 29:03.359
expert and shouted the chauffer and shouted the servants and shout at everyone and

29:03.909 --> 29:09.748
Behave in that manner. I mean that's what it is. The power is you see that's how the woman expressed their husband's positions

29:11.259 --> 29:15.029
But the other way now in the situation of a prophet

29:18.460 --> 29:23.549
The Prophet asserts its powers through law

29:26.830 --> 29:30.210
How much can you hate me I love you double

29:31.419 --> 29:34.799
Always whatever you will hate me. I lov love you double of that

29:35.559 --> 29:37.559
then what you know

29:38.139 --> 29:40.859
But to love one has to sacrifice

29:42.340 --> 29:44.340
one has to give

29:44.919 --> 29:46.919
One has to bear

29:48.190 --> 29:49.629
Love doesn't hang in the air

29:49.629 --> 29:56.129
That's one thing people don't understand love is not only talking LaVon if you are little gentle to someone is not the point

29:58.029 --> 30:04.018
But even that bearing is a joy because ultimately you are doing it for now

30:05.110 --> 30:09.299
If love is the joy giving thing then that painting is not much

30:11.679 --> 30:13.679
They are doing it for love sake

30:14.679 --> 30:18.929
See because love and less energy. It is shared. You cannot enjoy

30:23.499 --> 30:29.399
So first we have to be strict with ourselves I think will be a good idea and loving to others

30:31.119 --> 30:33.359
That may be the way we might work it out

30:35.379 --> 30:38.459
By God's face. We have a very nice place as an Asha

30:40.960 --> 30:46.799
We might get even better place you are the God's own blessed be

30:48.190 --> 30:51.690
No one can't believe that we could have such a nice place

30:53.710 --> 30:55.600
But

30:55.600 --> 31:02.999
What are we willing to do for it? That's the point. We should say don't take things for granted. I must want I

31:05.350 --> 31:07.350
Know England is the heart

31:09.320 --> 31:15.109
But in God's lamps one can create many hearts not so difficult

31:18.270 --> 31:25.070
So more harmony should be brought in even you will be surprised in France, it's so harmonious and so

31:30.360 --> 31:32.479
Find faults with yourself all the time

31:33.990 --> 31:37.070
Now under certain circumstances I have to appoint somebody

31:38.130 --> 31:44.839
Like I would say very personally I would say Nick because Nick is doing no job. It's quite a systematic person. He's all right

31:45.630 --> 31:46.830
this thing

31:46.830 --> 31:50.870
He has some problems. I know you two have problems. All right

31:51.510 --> 31:58.040
But he's the one available to me. Then. He's the one who is going to do. Say one take one case now

31:58.040 --> 32:00.680
You must understand. My mother has appointed somebody. All right

32:04.080 --> 32:07.610
Accept it because it's

32:18.240 --> 32:26.209
a big dance all entities dancing

32:32.670 --> 32:37.310
They are feeling the tenseness of the situation so try to entertain

32:49.019 --> 32:51.019
That's it that is look

32:52.049 --> 32:54.739
Like they want to really relax

32:57.210 --> 32:59.210
They want to relax

32:59.880 --> 33:02.419
They want you to feel nice to be joyous

33:05.070 --> 33:07.070
Look at them

33:08.759 --> 33:10.789
In the same way we should

33:13.559 --> 33:17.719
I'm sure I'm sure now henceforth I

33:20.009 --> 33:22.009
Think best thing is to make some poems

33:23.850 --> 33:25.830
That may be a solution

33:25.830 --> 33:27.830
Alright, let's see

33:28.590 --> 33:30.620
And let everybody start writing poems

33:31.740 --> 33:33.740
Will be a good idea

33:33.779 --> 33:35.869
and that will work out I

33:36.779 --> 33:38.869
sing the song of places

33:44.220 --> 33:46.220
It's very little way

33:46.590 --> 33:48.590
Just amazing in every way

33:48.720 --> 33:50.720
Just there in your heart

33:51.450 --> 33:53.450
besides the source of all the mood

33:54.330 --> 33:57.139
It's just turn your face towards that

33:58.710 --> 34:00.919
That will work out I'm sure it will work

34:03.870 --> 34:05.870
It's not very far away

34:12.929 --> 34:14.929
Let her also stand there she'd enjoy

34:35.159 --> 34:39.259
Now another point was that you are going to go to that peace mission or something

34:45.929 --> 34:47.929
Though in Brighton you're

34:51.629 --> 34:56.209
Alright and I told Kay has written an article about two pieces

34:58.980 --> 35:02.449
You know that piece is nothing without it is within yourself

35:02.880 --> 35:08.359
And if you can see your piece then only you can start feeling these four hours sahaja

35:08.359 --> 35:10.999
Yoga is don't need there's no other way. Yeah see

35:14.010 --> 35:21.409
At the level of say take the position of four o'clock now, let's see if Oakland Ireland is a very immediate problem

35:23.250 --> 35:26.059
Now at that level there's no solution

35:27.059 --> 35:34.609
There's no solution. They are quite justified in attacking back Rockland because these people very legally there

35:35.460 --> 35:41.240
Because that's not a democratic country. They have destroyed so many people of their own so English were justified

35:41.480 --> 35:44.480
of course, my all support was for them because they were

35:45.690 --> 35:47.690
correct on the justice part

35:48.450 --> 35:50.450
that's true, but just

35:54.809 --> 35:58.969
Because for whom to fight these are realized Souls

36:02.069 --> 36:04.219
They're right for what

36:08.880 --> 36:10.880
Even if you have democracy

36:10.890 --> 36:14.450
If it is democracy, what is through surviving democracy? I

36:15.150 --> 36:17.930
Mean if through democracy are creating only demons

36:19.049 --> 36:20.849
It's demonic

36:20.849 --> 36:24.078
Ray, then what is of having them democracy? Awesome?

36:25.109 --> 36:27.109
What about this so-called?

36:27.270 --> 36:28.980
communism

36:28.980 --> 36:31.010
All stupid people to my eye

36:31.770 --> 36:33.770
Everybody is stupid

36:34.470 --> 36:37.579
And they cannot achieve anything at that level

36:37.579 --> 36:43.159
You grunts a little matias, correct? After all you see that was there people were there under democracy?

36:43.170 --> 36:47.629
These people should have gone because they have killed so many people already in Argentina. They have no business

36:47.630 --> 36:55.549
And of course this particular is means absolutely against our job. So democracy is the best fruit ain't no doubt

36:56.370 --> 36:59.809
We have to support democracy, but even democracy for more

37:02.910 --> 37:04.910
White well democracy

37:08.640 --> 37:10.640
Who have the higher freedom

37:11.700 --> 37:15.649
If you cannot have higher freedom and it's just means abandonment to see

37:16.830 --> 37:22.039
Democracy means that an old man can marry a young girl and all sorts of nonsensical things

37:28.920 --> 37:32.029
So democracy is only suitable to people who are Hari

37:33.720 --> 37:37.369
Who have established their Dharma, otherwise you really need a

37:38.100 --> 37:39.600
communistic

37:39.600 --> 37:41.779
Country which will settle down with her mother

37:42.930 --> 37:44.930
to live a lot of

37:45.180 --> 37:51.349
But people think that democracy is for running yoga mum, you have freedom to do in your Karma's you like you see what's wrong

37:56.850 --> 38:01.819
It's a very you see you cannot say it's a dilemma again, I don't know which way to go

38:03.570 --> 38:08.360
It's another dilemma, so to end up the dilemma you have to talk to people that

38:11.190 --> 38:14.779
Though it might be justified at this time say Falkland thing

38:15.450 --> 38:19.039
Aggression is for this because next time they won't do such a thing again

38:19.650 --> 38:24.920
it's really for peace because next time such a thing they may not try this their spots and

38:25.380 --> 38:30.170
There are all these Germans have gone and settled there so it's a good thing but still

38:31.290 --> 38:37.640
It's not peace. It has a lot of people this thing is up. Why because people are not realized

38:38.610 --> 38:40.110
coming tan

38:40.110 --> 38:42.529
Alpha there's lot of space here move on

38:43.290 --> 38:48.130
So all those people who come for strips are monkeys anymore on this Oh Staniel

38:59.559 --> 39:02.819
So all these political institutions are a big joke

39:03.549 --> 39:11.369
Without realization. They are not yet fully human beings. They are not fully developed because they're not from their spin. You must find your spirit

39:12.369 --> 39:17.698
Unless you have found your spirit. No problem is going to be solved once your problem is solved

39:19.779 --> 39:25.619
That is to find your spirit all other problems are so how what will happen. Let's see

39:26.919 --> 39:32.369
What will happen if we establish a kingdom of the realized Souls?

39:39.219 --> 39:46.589
Let's hear the scholar what should happen

39:53.070 --> 39:55.699
Of course everybody will get up early in the morning

40:00.150 --> 40:03.289
Apart from that that's the most difficult thing

40:18.000 --> 40:21.439
Tell me whatever you say will happen

40:30.870 --> 40:32.870
There won't be any States

40:34.500 --> 40:39.770
You see God has not made any state system madness I tell you when I was born I was covered what

40:40.440 --> 40:47.120
See God that has not made me one of these. He said it's a very different thing than what you see I expected

40:47.700 --> 40:52.460
You see God has made a beautiful land. All right, like this one one, sorry like that

40:52.560 --> 40:55.429
Now you have to have some design pattern. So you made some

40:57.180 --> 41:00.080
Beautiful mountains and some nice

41:01.470 --> 41:03.890
Can say areas and some are

41:04.140 --> 41:11.119
desert some are easy to create the whole system if you see has worked out in such a way that you have a Twitter and

41:11.130 --> 41:15.439
You have the Sun there. So the will start meeting. This is all created

41:15.440 --> 41:19.880
So beautifully so you have different types of countries and different types of places

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
Now after creating that

41:26.580 --> 41:28.580
Human beings to be dust that

41:29.130 --> 41:36.049
The divided attention salary just took me tactical redesigns no need to divide like that. So they created States

41:36.050 --> 41:41.719
There was no need to create a state but you see happen like this that in the beginning they created state

41:41.880 --> 41:44.299
because they wanted to have a

41:46.290 --> 41:48.709
You can say a hot

41:49.410 --> 41:56.840
Protect themselves then a village then a CT now a state now after state. What is the next situation?

42:03.750 --> 42:06.320
Collective miss is the breaking is

42:09.030 --> 42:10.700
One word it is

42:10.700 --> 42:17.749
I believe me, but to me Sansa's proceed in so many I can't understand walking in the you see

42:18.570 --> 42:21.620
These customs and all that carry your passport that

42:22.320 --> 42:30.019
criminal number so-and-so and apart from that you can your photograph and then there are so many things my photo by the way my

42:30.660 --> 42:36.710
Passport is completely filled. Now. You have to get another one. It's like that you see everywhere you go. You look like criminal

42:36.710 --> 42:41.629
They look at your face and then they stamp on you. All right, you are stopped boy. That's terrible. It's

42:42.150 --> 42:46.519
Indentified absolutely there that means you do human beings have no dignity left in them. I

42:48.120 --> 42:50.120
Mean this land does it belong to you at all?

42:51.420 --> 42:53.420
this land of

42:53.580 --> 42:55.580
You are of all in the land

42:56.280 --> 43:00.410
Nothing belongs to you actually to be very frank. I'm sorry to say

43:03.360 --> 43:05.360
It's true

43:06.870 --> 43:08.870
So, what is the state

43:10.440 --> 43:11.760
Distinctness

43:11.760 --> 43:14.660
But stateless also means there is state in it. I

43:15.660 --> 43:17.660
Say this is one word

43:18.030 --> 43:23.870
This is has been is and will be I mean you may you know with you see

43:24.030 --> 43:29.090
Hallucination think it is different and fight this I sometimes feel you are just fighting your shadows

43:30.450 --> 43:38.299
This is the you have treated shadows and the shadows are fighting and just to make the shadows fight you fight otherwise shadows won't fight

43:40.800 --> 43:46.670
It's all a shadow there's no truth in to me it looks like that this all madness

43:51.690 --> 43:55.009
Everybody my god, you all should enjoy

43:59.670 --> 44:02.539
To enter into the kingdom he's

44:06.180 --> 44:09.200
In his kingdom there is nothing like a state

44:13.709 --> 44:17.089
So that's a very different world we are entering into

44:19.529 --> 44:22.279
There are no alternatives there it's only one

44:23.099 --> 44:24.749
absolute

44:24.749 --> 44:29.478
State of mind where you belong respect, that's wrong

44:32.579 --> 44:35.538
That's not going to be any aggravation it stupid to be aggressive

44:36.659 --> 44:39.859
There's not going to be any separation stupid to do that

44:40.559 --> 44:44.508
Nobody's going to be suppressed and nobody's going to take in something everybody. Why?

44:47.789 --> 44:49.789
Do you find that in the nature?

44:51.029 --> 44:55.998
Nobody does that it's a harmonious living in the nature even in the animal kingdom

44:56.759 --> 44:59.299
see they know that a

45:00.899 --> 45:06.319
Tiger has to live on an animal. It's all on that cattle has its own life finish

45:09.059 --> 45:12.918
Even they can understand the need but human beings don't

45:14.339 --> 45:16.339
They are newbies of spirit

45:17.069 --> 45:19.069
and spirit hates

45:19.439 --> 45:21.209
actually hates

45:21.209 --> 45:24.678
Aggression it cannot it cannot even if it wants you cannot

45:26.519 --> 45:30.228
It's in dignified to address any muscle for a spent

45:32.159 --> 45:34.789
In dignified absolutely it is wretched

45:41.130 --> 45:48.289
So that is what it is that we'll all enjoy love love of God his blessings

45:49.529 --> 45:50.969
and

45:50.969 --> 45:53.178
All our limitations will drop off

45:54.359 --> 45:56.359
So-called boots as you call them

45:56.519 --> 45:58.519
Hello

46:06.240 --> 46:08.240
It's a very different

46:10.109 --> 46:17.239
Atmosphere of reality this is all unreal is absolutely unreal. It's an illusion, I think

46:18.509 --> 46:25.369
because you know that Brahma is divine vibrations are doing everything they

46:27.420 --> 46:30.440
Are working out everything even material things

46:35.849 --> 46:37.849
Everything they can achieve

46:42.390 --> 46:49.759
Apart from that they give you that source of joy, which takes you onto that atmosphere where you exist and enjoy

46:54.359 --> 46:56.778
All the you just created by human beings

46:59.940 --> 47:01.940
This is all illusion

47:04.380 --> 47:06.380
Believe me it's all in you

47:08.519 --> 47:13.999
There is no truth in it at all what true illusion you can work out

47:18.660 --> 47:22.759
It's a very interesting thing that only through illusion you can work out

47:25.500 --> 47:27.500
Because

47:28.049 --> 47:33.109
When I am talking to you you have to keep an illusion of

47:34.470 --> 47:40.459
Being here. Otherwise, you won't pay any attention. You won't see me. You know me you won't talk to you

47:42.809 --> 47:44.809
So you have to help

47:45.720 --> 47:47.720
But I know this is illusion

47:48.869 --> 47:50.869
That's all

47:52.559 --> 47:57.018
Living in this world in this illusion if you know it's an illusion that's done

48:00.359 --> 48:02.808
You are going to be tomorrow citizens

48:04.710 --> 48:06.710
No doubt

48:07.730 --> 48:09.730
Of a very high level

48:10.490 --> 48:11.960
On it

48:11.960 --> 48:18.550
They will come when they will have to jolly. Well two consultants already have seen how I'm playing tricks on the US

48:19.520 --> 48:23.169
Did you hear the way the lady made mistakes? I see there's two big things

48:23.360 --> 48:28.419
Did you find that I saw a photograph and I said, oh this stupid woman. She just changed her angle

48:30.860 --> 48:37.689
Now they are realizing that they don't know what happens they'll suddenly have they go amok they'll all go amok

48:39.290 --> 48:46.479
And then they will have to find out how they should be controlled what has happened, how did

48:47.840 --> 48:50.709
All these tricks one has to play with all of them

48:52.280 --> 48:55.689
Now after the last war perhaps

48:56.570 --> 48:59.979
People may not have come out with many aggressive words, perhaps maybe

49:00.620 --> 49:03.669
Because it will be unpopular but they'll do such stupid things

49:04.310 --> 49:06.789
To prove that they are good for nothing

49:10.940 --> 49:12.940
All this can be done

49:13.070 --> 49:18.729
But you must know it's an illusion all of you because you are different things. You are seeing through different eyes

49:18.790 --> 49:20.790
You know what Islam is?

49:21.380 --> 49:23.380
so you must

49:24.020 --> 49:26.020
Raise your quality

49:27.680 --> 49:29.680
Raise your quality a

49:31.850 --> 49:33.770
Normal life

49:33.770 --> 49:37.360
supposing is he like I'll say that somebody is a

49:39.470 --> 49:40.730
Pure

49:40.730 --> 49:42.730
Then he dresses up in a particular way

49:43.700 --> 49:45.730
Then he suddenly becomes an officer

49:45.950 --> 49:53.439
Then he becomes a different style as he walks in a different ways gate changes style changes. So now you have become prophets

49:57.680 --> 49:59.680
Whole thing has to change

50:00.950 --> 50:06.470
Either you don't accept this position, but if you are accepting this position and you were paid for it

50:08.010 --> 50:10.010
Then better be that I

50:12.450 --> 50:15.980
Mean you can't dress up like a few if you are an officer. Can you?

50:23.010 --> 50:27.560
It's all illusion complete Egyptian the whole thing is an

50:30.690 --> 50:37.550
All these kings of yours and heels are like dogs there before especially mr. Pope who soon came here

50:39.900 --> 50:45.530
My grandson says, mr. Popo camión said Pope said, I'm sorry poor

50:48.630 --> 50:53.510
And he was talking all rubbish I say how do you know because all his chakras are catching

50:56.280 --> 50:58.459
And he's supposed to be the Pope in charge

51:00.210 --> 51:02.210
Now Bishop of Canterbury

51:02.730 --> 51:08.810
See, he's another funny man. I've seen him on the thing. He was agnostic about empathy. I don't know about Christ

51:08.810 --> 51:10.810
Also me me he said I'm agnostic

51:11.250 --> 51:12.530
Any question you ask him?

51:12.530 --> 51:19.099
I'm agnostic you very good escape he has got is he he's agnostic off about everything because he said you sir missed you to me

51:19.560 --> 51:22.969
So what are you doing there? I mean if it's a mystery to you, it's

51:23.790 --> 51:26.899
I mean, I just don't understand. How is he thinking?

51:31.319 --> 51:39.079
So some people have taken upon themselves this you say now we need to talk I mean, how can you talk to your shadow?

51:47.760 --> 51:49.909
So the people live in the shadow state

51:51.930 --> 51:53.849
And

51:53.849 --> 52:00.439
You should not symbolize yourself. I service. You should symbolize yourself our reality and look at them as shadows you see

52:01.500 --> 52:05.239
In a way, you know, very dignified. You know, this is a shall go, you know, just

52:06.690 --> 52:08.690
fit in here

52:09.420 --> 52:12.710
But not an aggressive way but have compassion about them

52:13.710 --> 52:16.669
Say no no sir. It is not so you are sending mistake

52:17.579 --> 52:19.579
This is the shadow of love

52:22.380 --> 52:24.380
The whole Christianity's doomed

52:26.490 --> 52:28.490
Because they started running after shadow

52:30.329 --> 52:35.599
This mr. St. Paul, I don't know how he came into math now you are a theologies to tell me John

52:35.940 --> 52:41.119
How did he enter? I mean anybody who says he saw Christ is he supposed to enter into the Bible?

52:44.819 --> 52:52.219
How did he I mean his sayings and his words and his letters are regarded as the letters from the Bible

52:56.640 --> 53:01.879
After Christ before Christ is all right, but after Christ

53:05.010 --> 53:07.219
What is the validity I don't understand

53:07.220 --> 53:13.849
What is the credibility of this person entering into that as an authority how?

53:18.180 --> 53:20.180
Well, nobody challenged him

53:21.210 --> 53:24.770
He was a man who was killing so many people before then suddenly

53:24.770 --> 53:30.829
He becomes something and he starts saying I am doing Christ's work and this and that and write letter to Corinth occurrence and all these

53:30.829 --> 53:34.399
people and all that and why these letters that he writes becomes a

53:34.920 --> 53:36.920
Bible penny Mattox

53:39.720 --> 53:47.059
What did he do in his own lifetime half of it is spent in killing and half of it is he was an impostor

53:49.290 --> 53:51.499
I'm happy that it has come to your notice

53:52.940 --> 53:59.139
But one can ask why? Why is he there now? He started this charismatic thing. He's doing worldly

54:01.280 --> 54:04.300
At first sight in India this is st. Paul's Church

54:05.330 --> 54:07.330
They're all for this people, you know

54:08.180 --> 54:13.119
One of my uncle's was the priest of that he was a vapor this time reactant fedorable

54:15.020 --> 54:21.040
And when I saw that I wanted to see the st. Paul's might be what he had read number I was amazed

54:21.830 --> 54:23.750
But I said let two people

54:23.750 --> 54:25.750
need an solution

54:26.960 --> 54:34.779
And this horrible charismatic movement is anti-god activity absolutely anti-god activity

54:37.550 --> 54:41.080
So if you have to talk to the gentleman you have to tell him about

54:41.900 --> 54:43.900
That it is possession

54:43.940 --> 54:48.429
the Seventh day Adventists and what are the in this Pentecost is nothing, but that

54:48.770 --> 54:52.150
Jamaicans are doing all of them are great spiritually developed people

54:52.820 --> 54:54.820
Spiritually in the power. I

55:01.340 --> 55:04.029
Mean there should be certain norms, isn't it?

55:05.150 --> 55:07.150
About a person who?

55:07.490 --> 55:11.079
Is supposed to be a prophet or something something to do with God you see

55:16.670 --> 55:21.999
The world is coming to a position where they are understanding but you see once they start disregarding

55:23.360 --> 55:27.069
The danger is this once they start disregarding

55:28.130 --> 55:33.249
These things because they are myths and falsehood. They will disregard also what?

55:34.550 --> 55:41.470
And all the truth about God they can become communist. That's the easiest way

55:44.180 --> 55:46.180
That there is no return

55:50.569 --> 55:52.569
It's a dangerous situation

55:53.209 --> 55:56.199
When you talk to him, you have to tell him one

55:57.109 --> 55:59.109
Already your churches are selling here

56:01.249 --> 56:03.249
Nobody goes to church

56:10.430 --> 56:15.279
Now about the environment they're having an me meeting on environment

56:16.369 --> 56:18.848
That too is only solved through spirit

56:19.729 --> 56:25.179
all involve problems can be solved only spiritual if you have spiritual ascent otherwise

56:25.700 --> 56:27.849
You try anything is like patching up this high

56:31.279 --> 56:34.059
See now it's a very deep-rooted thing

56:35.150 --> 56:38.859
That we don't understand that spirit is the most practical thing

56:39.650 --> 56:42.969
You see we think straight we think it's like a drunken

56:44.209 --> 56:46.209
Spiritual man, he's a cunt

56:46.609 --> 56:48.758
He's a drunkard. He's most abnormal

56:49.489 --> 56:55.239
Funny either he hits people or runs away from them. This is the idea we have gone about this

56:57.199 --> 56:59.199
But just see you are spiritual

57:01.279 --> 57:05.679
You will find it impossible to use plastics after something

57:08.449 --> 57:10.449
Because you will know that

57:13.039 --> 57:15.039
Plastics give you horrid vibrations

57:17.509 --> 57:22.269
After some time you will be really you'll find it repulsive

57:25.249 --> 57:29.019
It's alright to sit in a train for a while on a plastic Coach

57:30.799 --> 57:34.988
But to sit in your house on a plastic all the time

57:35.779 --> 57:38.258
Would be horrible and to wear a plastic coat

57:39.199 --> 57:41.199
all the time

57:42.650 --> 57:44.650
Our body will refuse

57:45.559 --> 57:52.839
So when people will be spiritually awakened they will give up all these nonsensical things

57:54.640 --> 57:59.400
So then they say then what will happen to the machines now machines are for us we are not for the machines

58:03.309 --> 58:09.028
This is this is another concept is whatever create is for us and we are not for that. All right doesn't matter

58:09.029 --> 58:14.609
Nothing will go wrong with the machines machines should be used for anything. That is a public

58:15.160 --> 58:21.989
One like for motor cars for your trains trams all public work, which is outside

58:23.619 --> 58:26.818
For houses at the most you can use machines

58:27.489 --> 58:30.269
but for personal things you must meet how

58:30.910 --> 58:32.910
We must use handmade

58:33.789 --> 58:35.380
handmade things

58:35.380 --> 58:42.269
For spiritual people would like to have something that is handmade or real when I can't wear a nylon sir

58:42.460 --> 58:45.720
Not that I am very fussy about you, but I just can't feel it

58:46.809 --> 58:51.449
After some time if I do not take out my soft 79 on what to do

58:52.359 --> 58:54.359
now vibrations get junk

58:58.450 --> 59:00.450
So you won't be able to wear

59:01.630 --> 59:06.630
Next to your skin near your skin near your body eating your clove everything in plastics

59:07.269 --> 59:09.269
Cooking in plastics. I mean, it's too much

59:10.029 --> 59:12.329
Thank God creaking I don't think is possible inclusion

59:13.329 --> 59:16.528
But aluminium is another thing it is very bad

59:18.069 --> 59:20.069
Aluminium you won't be able to

59:20.710 --> 59:23.369
You either try copper or brass things

59:23.769 --> 59:29.549
Now handmade things will you Bob because they are made by hand. So they have vibrations people would like to have one

59:31.150 --> 59:33.150
It takes a part

59:33.549 --> 59:39.629
So by that we remove the disparity of the world developing countries can do handmade things

59:40.210 --> 59:43.409
You cannot beat them with computers can

59:45.940 --> 59:48.299
You guys go ahead mad with your computers

59:49.930 --> 59:51.930
You will have to come back

59:52.690 --> 59:54.670
Must understand the whole

59:54.670 --> 59:57.210
If you don't understand the whole this is what is happening

59:57.730 --> 01:00:01.980
Like mad, you know computers going ahead ahead and we're into the ditch

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:10.179
In cryptic mouth now they have created big mountains of

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.409
Plastic, they don't know what to do with it. So

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.879
I know with computer. What will they do?

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.210
They'll create a greater

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:26.080
Mountains out of plastics maybe Himalaya I indicated

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:29.950
With the copter

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:34.629
So the developing countries should not try to follow these mad people on one side

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:42.490
they should develop their hand things and all that because they'll have to come back now the handmade things in this country are so

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:46.840
Important and so expensive you don't care whether it is pressed or not

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:52.509
But I mean, do you have to take nylons because this is nylons is a symbol of development

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.269
Not of our development perhaps but of development so they must take two nylons and

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.659
Plastics and two stainless steel and aluminium if possible

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.710
That's what we are doing

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.710
When you have less things

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.149
Consumed like that you use less things from your motherland

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.670
Because handmade you cannot go on mad

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:22.540
Like a machine goes like a raksasa eating away everything and producing more shit has to live like that. It is not economical

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:30.100
So when you have a handmade thing you have more value for your things you look after them better you feel better

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.410
You are comfortable and you?

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:34.780
Need not be that smart you see

01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.330
machine made

01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:40.269
That idea of smartness is going now

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:47.290
So the developing countries should also learn a lesson. They are going after you know, they are running fast. They try to run faster

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.230
They cannot

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:50.230
Thank God they cannot

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.990
But they should stick on to that side

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:57.340
You see one part of the country has to be something another part has to do something else

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.210
But two people have to look after

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.059
The side of machines, all right, I mean handmade things what can I make

01:02:09.619 --> 01:02:12.959
Some serum exciting apologies

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:22.620
Some apologies for that you better do what you know better and let them do what they can do better and share

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.880
If this balance is established, there's no aggression

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:41.639
Unemployment can be solved all the problems can be solved if you take to handle optics. We should take to handmade as far as possible

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:45.419
Sahaja, yoga should you hand me things?

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:48.150
We're not the cars

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.050
But for their personal use

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:59.219
Even I would say soap suds are horrid the soaps that you get in England are not meant for

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.029
Your your skin's at all for sahaja yoga. See I can't bear

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:11.700
What you have to is natural soaps that you get get from any country if you like but natural source

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.090
Which comes from natural oils?

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.490
Food also

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.959
Natural food. You must eat more natural food than artificial

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.600
All that will give you a better living and that is called as alternative

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.409
All right, that's all today is important, but that doesn't mean you go in a bullock cart

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:40.229
You can export your planes to India on your car to India and get khadi from there you're right

01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:43.770
We should understand

01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:47.219
Because we are part and parcel of one whole

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:54.479
and we just cannot exist by our only growth because then we become malignant to see oneself seeds are another

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.719
You have to if you have a machinery you have to each other

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:03.330
Because you produce so much you must find markets for them you must supply them

01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:06.090
You must send over then you must have other countries to attract them

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:14.040
People have tremendous respect for Mahatma Gandhi, but I don't know if people understand what he said about machinery

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:21.450
That doesn't mean the people who are doing machine work should give up by any chance, but some of them they can close down

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.910
For example plastic

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.920
Toys for children is horrifying

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:37.799
You can't even get wood toys now nothing just plastic they're touching plastic I mean imagine you cannot feel any plastic

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:49.349
So this is what a sane sahaja yogi has to understand that's how you can solve the problem of environmental

01:04:56.859 --> 01:05:00.899
Thank God somehow with your affluence and too much of machinery

01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:08.068
All the Western people, I'm happy to know even in Portugal realize the value of

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:10.359
Hand me

01:05:10.359 --> 01:05:12.568
But in India if you offer somebody

01:05:13.299 --> 01:05:15.389
In an handmade thing. They say Oh God

01:05:16.509 --> 01:05:19.379
They have no money, but stainless tea great

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:31.228
In a stainless steel glass they'll give you tea see it's very big if you give it in a ceramic

01:05:31.229 --> 01:05:33.809
Ah what this village craft?

01:05:37.509 --> 01:05:39.509
They have to be told

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:45.599
But if you create a demand they'll be all right, they look after their handmade thing and here you can't do much

01:05:45.599 --> 01:05:47.818
I've seen you see that it test that

01:05:48.339 --> 01:05:52.828
Deafness is not there. That's lucky now lost it very few people have that left in them?

01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:56.788
Even if they have to cut one coat with their hands they cannot do it

01:05:57.729 --> 01:05:59.999
They have to use a machine which cuts

01:06:00.969 --> 01:06:02.969
25 coats at times

01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:08.498
Ha then this problem of you have to have a figure

01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:13.659
Exactly because these only can fit certain figures. You can't have your own independent figure

01:06:14.239 --> 01:06:19.929
This is all machine like stuff. You see you all must have that figure. Otherwise none fit it. So that is an ideal figure

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.059
So everybody works out for that

01:06:22.249 --> 01:06:27.279
See there's a new machinery comes up you see for that kind of a thing then new styles to come there

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.909
It's such an artificial thing all man-made artificial

01:06:35.539 --> 01:06:38.679
From your democracy your politics to your economics

01:06:40.339 --> 01:06:42.339
To all your

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:43.880
so-called

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.769
ideas of creativity

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:47.769
everything becomes so artificial

01:06:47.869 --> 01:06:49.869
Now people can't paint

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:55.869
What they paint if you see is you are just a ghast you don't know what is this supposed to be

01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:57.470
and

01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:01.929
It is supposed to be the symmetric loops. There's a hand, isn't it? Got to see that? Yes, I can

01:07:07.999 --> 01:07:11.679
They can't do anything we can't have Shakespeare

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:21.669
We can't have doggie we can't have anyone of that time we can't have

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:27.130
Abraham Lincoln

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:36.700
We can have only machines you see bolts and laxity fitted nicely you fixed your fixed your fixture for instance

01:07:37.279 --> 01:07:39.279
everybody fix license

01:07:39.739 --> 01:07:43.959
Where do double this brain go where in this heart go? What will you do then?

01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:49.869
It cannot collapse, I mean it's as long as you are existing the heart has to be

01:07:53.749 --> 01:07:59.619
So all these artificialities has to be overcome by sahaja Yogi's the responsibility so build

01:08:01.969 --> 01:08:03.969
Such a big

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:11.680
Building you have to bear on your shoulders and the foundation stones have to get up in the morning

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.180
To be chiseled out properly

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.140
So I adapt my

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.809
Next you today may God bless
