00:02.630 --> 00:15.730
[Music]

00:09.900 --> 00:20.270
[Applause]

00:15.730 --> 00:26.619
this pure spirit within us is the

00:20.270 --> 00:26.619
reflection of God Almighty Sadashiva

00:29.290 --> 00:46.429
it's like the Sun that falls in the

00:38.930 --> 00:52.309
water and gives a clear reflection or

00:46.429 --> 00:57.140
else it falls on the stone it doesn't

00:52.309 --> 01:01.850
give any reflection at all if you have

00:57.140 --> 01:09.560
say the mirror the Sun will not only

01:01.850 --> 01:15.230
fall on the mirror but will reflect back

01:09.560 --> 01:22.220
its light in the same way in the human

01:15.230 --> 01:28.899
beings the reflection of God Almighty is

01:22.220 --> 01:33.110
expressed in a way your personality is

01:28.899 --> 01:38.060
if your personality is clean and clear

01:33.110 --> 01:41.079
innocent then that reflection could be

01:38.060 --> 01:41.079
like a mirror

01:41.890 --> 01:52.939
thus the saintly people they reflect God

01:46.219 --> 01:57.170
Almighty in the proper manner in the

01:52.939 --> 02:02.509
sense that their own identification with

01:57.170 --> 02:07.880
wrong things is no more when there is no

02:02.509 --> 02:13.700
such identification and when a person is

02:07.880 --> 02:19.000
absolutely the pure spirit then the

02:13.700 --> 02:24.099
reflection of God reflects into us

02:19.000 --> 02:27.140
luckily you all have got your

02:24.099 --> 02:31.099
self-realization that means the

02:27.140 --> 02:35.030
reflection of God my Almighty is already

02:31.099 --> 02:43.579
working into your attention the

02:35.030 --> 02:53.150
attention is enlightened by the power of

02:43.579 --> 02:59.810
the Spirit so when you are in sahaja

02:53.150 --> 03:03.919
yoga you have cleansed out yourself your

02:59.810 --> 03:09.010
Kundalini has also cleansed and now you

03:03.919 --> 03:14.049
have pure personalities that's why this

03:09.010 --> 03:18.799
reflection is clearer and clearer and

03:14.049 --> 03:22.699
people see it see it on your face see it

03:18.799 --> 03:28.419
in your body they see it in your work in

03:22.699 --> 03:33.079
your behavior in everywhere it is

03:28.419 --> 03:37.069
difficult for people to really believe

03:33.079 --> 03:40.729
in themselves that they could be the

03:37.069 --> 03:45.169
reflection of God Almighty they have

03:40.729 --> 03:47.959
some sort of a complexes about

03:45.169 --> 03:52.099
themselves I think that they cannot

03:47.959 --> 03:57.579
understand how they have suddenly become

03:52.099 --> 03:57.579
the reflection of God Almighty

04:00.260 --> 04:10.880
but they have a capacity and they can

04:05.550 --> 04:13.890
become the reflection of God Almighty

04:10.880 --> 04:17.459
for which they have to have faith in

04:13.890 --> 04:21.320
themselves faith in their ascent to

04:17.459 --> 04:24.920
believe that we have become that you

04:21.320 --> 04:28.170
must have confidence in sahaja yoga and

04:24.920 --> 04:31.260
confidence in yourself that you are on

04:28.170 --> 04:35.550
the right path and that you are now

04:31.260 --> 04:37.740
saved and nobody can attack you because

04:35.550 --> 04:42.870
you have the complete protection of the

04:37.740 --> 04:48.030
divine with the proper understanding

04:42.870 --> 04:51.000
that you are the pure spirit if you

04:48.030 --> 04:55.260
believe in that then you will be

04:51.000 --> 04:59.160
surprised that you will be very

04:55.260 --> 05:02.460
confident about what you are doing we

04:59.160 --> 05:06.920
have now sahaja Yogi's all over but what

05:02.460 --> 05:10.850
I find among sahaja Yogi's is this that

05:06.920 --> 05:15.800
some of the sahaja Yogi's grow very fast

05:10.850 --> 05:19.440
steadily strongly they achieve their

05:15.800 --> 05:22.740
principle of Shiva that the first

05:19.440 --> 05:28.320
achievement shows that from inside they

05:22.740 --> 05:31.380
start getting detached now detachment is

05:28.320 --> 05:35.370
not mental it's not mental it is not

05:31.380 --> 05:38.820
that we have to take to some sort of a

05:35.370 --> 05:41.430
sannyasa or you have to go to Himalayas

05:38.820 --> 05:45.960
give up our families and all that but

05:41.430 --> 05:50.250
the detachment is within oneself when

05:45.960 --> 05:55.560
that detachment starts working the first

05:50.250 --> 06:01.080
sign is that we become Joy's we become

05:55.560 --> 06:01.700
happy now if you ask anyone why are you

06:01.080 --> 06:06.240
unhappy

06:01.700 --> 06:11.490
he'll talk about this why maybe his

06:06.240 --> 06:16.250
house maybe his children maybe

06:11.490 --> 06:22.680
his country maybe society whatever it is

06:16.250 --> 06:25.380
so he gets absolutely upset or maybe

06:22.680 --> 06:31.490
very unhappy to see things happening

06:25.380 --> 06:36.230
around him now he is a realized soul

06:31.490 --> 06:40.800
this unhappiness is not going to help

06:36.230 --> 06:45.900
what is needed is now to know that you

06:40.800 --> 06:49.680
can correct all these eats of the

06:45.900 --> 06:54.570
society of the family of the whole

06:49.680 --> 06:58.080
country by transforming others not by

06:54.570 --> 07:00.270
feeling bad but while doing that the

06:58.080 --> 07:04.130
main thing that you should have is a

07:00.270 --> 07:08.180
complete detachment now how to achieve

07:04.130 --> 07:12.750
detachment is the point to understand

07:08.180 --> 07:16.860
yourself you should introspect try to

07:12.750 --> 07:20.610
find out - what thing am i attached why

07:16.860 --> 07:23.280
am i miserable for whom am I worried why

07:20.610 --> 07:26.190
should I worry you should discover about

07:23.280 --> 07:29.280
yourself what's wrong with you which

07:26.190 --> 07:32.280
side is catching is it right or left

07:29.280 --> 07:34.950
side it's meditation you can find out

07:32.280 --> 07:37.770
are you attached to money are you

07:34.950 --> 07:41.010
attached to business are you attached to

07:37.770 --> 07:48.660
your family are you attached to your

07:41.010 --> 07:51.930
country in a way which is not such or to

07:48.660 --> 07:57.030
your culture which is not such then try

07:51.930 --> 08:00.570
to get rid of this attachment by

07:57.030 --> 08:03.930
meditation this attachment will show on

08:00.570 --> 08:07.050
your fingertips and you have to see for

08:03.930 --> 08:11.160
yourself what centers you are catching

08:07.050 --> 08:16.080
in which way are you in problem and then

08:11.160 --> 08:19.230
you can clarify it very simply by taking

08:16.080 --> 08:23.670
a very simple search treatment

08:19.230 --> 08:27.030
I think here we fail that once we get

08:23.670 --> 08:29.190
attached to something we don't even

08:27.030 --> 08:31.350
think we are getting in time you think

08:29.190 --> 08:34.770
we're doing very great thing because now

08:31.350 --> 08:39.060
we love this person love that person she

08:34.770 --> 08:41.430
was qualities the compassion part that

08:39.060 --> 08:44.370
is no compassion of any kind to be

08:41.430 --> 08:47.310
attached to any such things is no

08:44.370 --> 08:53.780
compassion in you cannot have compassion

08:47.310 --> 08:58.680
of Shiva because that compassion is very

08:53.780 --> 09:00.780
few it is like as I have told you many

08:58.680 --> 09:05.820
times it's like the SAP in the tree

09:00.780 --> 09:08.670
which rises and goes to various parts of

09:05.820 --> 09:11.280
this tree and then either it's

09:08.670 --> 09:14.700
evaporates or goes down into mother

09:11.280 --> 09:18.090
earth it's not attached if it gets

09:14.700 --> 09:23.730
attached to one flower or to one leaf or

09:18.090 --> 09:26.880
to one fruit then the whole tree will

09:23.730 --> 09:30.420
suffer and also the flower will

09:26.880 --> 09:31.650
discipline in meditating on your heart

09:30.420 --> 09:34.980
on the Shiva tattva

09:31.650 --> 09:37.800
the principle of Shiva you can

09:34.980 --> 09:42.570
definitely detach and then the joy will

09:37.800 --> 09:44.850
be the maximum you can have interest you

09:42.570 --> 09:47.610
should have interest but in that

09:44.850 --> 09:51.540
interest there should be enlightenment

09:47.610 --> 09:54.750
that you cannot get attached what you

09:51.540 --> 09:57.540
know is much higher much greater and

09:54.750 --> 10:00.390
much more joy giving now these

09:57.540 --> 10:03.660
attachments people think that is very

10:00.390 --> 10:07.230
joy-giving it's a very wrong idea the

10:03.660 --> 10:10.170
joy comes from your own source of your

10:07.230 --> 10:13.080
spirit whether your husband is good

10:10.170 --> 10:16.860
whether your children are good or bad

10:13.080 --> 10:20.130
whatever they are they cannot give you

10:16.860 --> 10:24.720
John it's only you can enjoy yourself

10:20.130 --> 10:27.000
and this is why one becomes very

10:24.720 --> 10:30.820
forgiving

10:27.000 --> 10:34.090
when nobody can harm you then whom are

10:30.820 --> 10:37.030
you going to be angry with that is

10:34.090 --> 10:39.940
another great quality of Sadashiva is

10:37.030 --> 10:40.810
that is extremely forgiving he goes up

10:39.940 --> 10:43.720
to a point

10:40.810 --> 10:47.470
till he destroys the whole work of

10:43.720 --> 10:51.730
auditioning but otherwise he's very very

10:47.470 --> 10:56.820
forgiving and he also is very balanced

10:51.730 --> 11:02.760
about it what I find that in the whole

10:56.820 --> 11:11.590
atmosphere of today in the modern times

11:02.760 --> 11:14.760
there's a big struggle going on which is

11:11.590 --> 11:21.010
not she was culture

11:14.760 --> 11:25.810
she was culture is they I should say the

11:21.010 --> 11:33.480
Sahaj culture if you are sahaja Yogi's

11:25.810 --> 11:39.700
if you have compassionate understanding

11:33.480 --> 11:43.510
of others feelings and also you should

11:39.700 --> 11:47.680
have readiness to look after not only

11:43.510 --> 11:50.460
sahaja Yogi's also non sahaja yoga then

11:47.680 --> 11:52.930
your compassion will become effective

11:50.460 --> 11:56.830
you should have also collective

11:52.930 --> 11:59.940
meditation in your ashrams

11:56.830 --> 12:03.160
will be a good idea if you can try

11:59.940 --> 12:04.240
collective meditation will be nice but

12:03.160 --> 12:08.110
you don't have to give vibrations

12:04.240 --> 12:10.030
training you don't have to look after

12:08.110 --> 12:12.790
the chakras of others you just bother

12:10.030 --> 12:16.270
yourself what's wrong with you and now

12:12.790 --> 12:20.910
whatever is the solution for your ascent

12:16.270 --> 12:24.700
if you put because the responsibility of

12:20.910 --> 12:27.840
the whole world rests on sahaja Yogi's

12:24.700 --> 12:31.510
this you know that there's no way out

12:27.840 --> 12:36.220
without sahaja yoga to save humanity

12:31.510 --> 12:38.360
from all kinds of problems sahaja yoga

12:36.220 --> 12:40.639
has come on this earth

12:38.360 --> 12:45.230
so it is your responsibility to keep

12:40.639 --> 12:47.660
yourself in proper shape as far as

12:45.230 --> 12:51.639
sahaja Yoga is concerned get rid of your

12:47.660 --> 12:55.910
left and get rid of your right and then

12:51.639 --> 12:58.429
to spread sahaja yoga not by bombastic

12:55.910 --> 13:02.420
words or aggressiveness but with love

12:58.429 --> 13:05.059
and compassion I am sure we have done a

13:02.420 --> 13:08.629
lot we have achieved a lot but there are

13:05.059 --> 13:11.569
still some points here and there which

13:08.629 --> 13:14.749
is a very unpleasant task for me to

13:11.569 --> 13:19.309
correct them or whatever it is I have to

13:14.749 --> 13:22.970
say that is working and everybody should

13:19.309 --> 13:25.519
look at themselves and feel happy from

13:22.970 --> 13:29.529
where they have come here and how far we

13:25.519 --> 13:29.529
have to may God bless you

13:34.400 --> 13:36.430
Oh
