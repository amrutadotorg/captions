00:03.700 --> 00:05.340
Culie, have you written it down?

00:05.980 --> 00:09.023
Hello, How are you? May God bless you.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.983
You can sit on the chair. Be comfortable.

00:15.904 --> 00:18.919
Ask Culie to write it down for him.

01:00.473 --> 01:03.381
Hello! How are you Douglas? How are you?

01:03.543 --> 01:05.223
Douglas Fry: Very well!

01:05.348 --> 01:06.868
Looking very fine!

01:07.128 --> 01:09.336
Just like a flower, beautiful!

01:09.552 --> 01:13.531
See what beautiful children I have,

01:13.679 --> 01:15.879
just like these petals over here.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.581
Can you open a window for a while.

01:28.242 --> 01:30.775
Just open the window for five minutes.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.576
Sit comfortably.

01:48.780 --> 01:52.510
Be comfortable, like this. I mean. Yes, be very comfortable.

01:52.669 --> 01:56.716
One has to be very, very comfortable, very comfortable.

01:57.300 --> 02:02.600
She got it even before she had seen me!

02:03.460 --> 02:07.059
Because that shows that it’s flicking in the air.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.320
Because.

02:29.720 --> 02:34.284
Today I want to tell you about further meditation:

02:34.410 --> 02:38.122
how we have to go and how we have to understand ourselves.

02:41.100 --> 02:45.280
You see the thing is so far you have had habits

02:45.680 --> 02:49.499
of dealing with things and your practices.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.601
how you have dealt with worldly problems,

02:54.576 --> 03:00.341
with your personal problems, your physical problems, body problems,

03:01.841 --> 03:05.523
but now as you have entered into the Kingdom of God

03:05.931 --> 03:08.831
and the power of God is flowing through you,

03:09.200 --> 03:15.109
you must know that your solutions

03:15.268 --> 03:19.134
and your styles have to be different now.

03:20.304 --> 03:23.182
That is... You have to...

03:25.900 --> 03:30.000
put your attention at the disposal of God.

03:30.280 --> 03:34.831
Actually in your attention His light is flooded.

03:35.413 --> 03:37.306
I’ll try to explain it,

03:37.443 --> 03:40.644
because it’s just the opposite of what you have so far known.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.640
You always thought that you had to put your attention to a point

03:44.720 --> 03:47.923
and then you have to move

03:50.043 --> 03:53.703
then you have to attack the subject or attack the problem

03:53.880 --> 03:56.928
put all your energies divert to it and...

03:57.200 --> 03:59.274
Hello, how are you?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.987
and to...

04:09.969 --> 04:17.293
then take upon your self the responsibility the complete

04:20.455 --> 04:23.800
technique of the whole thing, how to work it out and...

04:23.948 --> 04:26.770
That was the sort of a ...

04:31.220 --> 04:34.603
a life's experience for you.

04:35.205 --> 04:39.513
You would use all your experiences that you have had

04:39.694 --> 04:42.758
about such a problem about a particular type of problem

04:42.860 --> 04:46.638
all others, whatever they have had all the books that are available

04:46.755 --> 04:48.703
and even out of sorts of these

04:48.805 --> 04:52.443
enterprises that have been for a particular problem, alright,

04:52.545 --> 04:55.130
- then you attack it, that problem.

04:55.306 --> 04:58.455
and then you find that when you try to attack it

04:58.593 --> 05:01.070
just slips out of your hands, you just can not find it,

05:01.273 --> 05:04.817
you do not understand how you have missed it

05:05.093 --> 05:07.902
The Sahaja is a very different system:

05:08.016 --> 05:12.528
now you have entered into a Kingdom of God - you are saints.

05:13.595 --> 05:16.997
And everything that was built so far is for your good.

05:17.111 --> 05:20.011
You have to experiment and see for yourself.

05:20.460 --> 05:24.029
But the thing is: you must give it a chance.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.394
Your attention itself is not located right.

05:29.267 --> 05:33.738
You don’t have to go to any books, you do not have to go anywhere.

05:34.040 --> 05:38.425
Your attention itself is flooded with that light which is dynamic.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.875
Now, if anything comes in your attention, you just..

05:43.079 --> 05:45.594
connect your attention with the Divine's attention How?

05:45.696 --> 05:48.229
By saying: “All right, let it be done.

05:49.618 --> 05:52.328
Let this be done. It’s your wish.”

05:52.820 --> 05:57.529
Thy will be done, this is what you should say: thy will be done.

05:58.084 --> 06:00.104
You just say this you will be surprised.

06:00.283 --> 06:02.332
And then the whole mechanism,

06:02.413 --> 06:04.746
that enlightened attention of yours

06:04.932 --> 06:07.694
is the part of the attention of God Itself.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.087
So the whole thing will work out, the whole force.

06:10.186 --> 06:13.621
As you have worked for your personal problem before,

06:13.769 --> 06:16.929
now the whole of it will work out and it will happen.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.903
It’s such a wonderful thing.

06:19.016 --> 06:24.424
And the attention has to be there, has to be in the subtle.

06:24.892 --> 06:27.331
Because your attention is in the gross

06:27.435 --> 06:30.571
that’s why you attack the problem in this manner.

06:30.703 --> 06:34.022
If your attention is somehow or other made

06:34.227 --> 06:40.122
more attracted towards the subtle then, what happens

06:40.221 --> 06:42.384
[is] the effect of that will be shown.

06:42.555 --> 06:44.100
Otherwise also, you will it.

06:44.214 --> 06:47.455
But then you will see it very clearly how it acts.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.360
For example now, say,

06:51.220 --> 06:55.990
I come in my room and you have done all these things so beautifully,

06:56.082 --> 06:58.927
it's all worked out so nicely,

06:59.356 --> 07:02.963
then when I come in here and I see all that,

07:03.980 --> 07:09.172
I don’t see every minute part of it, I don't see how it is done,

07:09.335 --> 07:12.666
this, that, but I just stand here,

07:12.812 --> 07:15.870
and I feel the whole thing within me, bubbling.

07:16.020 --> 07:20.280
It works, and it gives me joy, gives me joy, fills me with joy.

07:20.394 --> 07:23.980
Different types of joy start flowing in my body, in my being.

07:24.140 --> 07:28.546
In my full understanding it’s flowing, it’s making me happy.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.943
Now I don't judge it on the way the people who judge.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.807
They would immediately come supposing you see it is

07:35.898 --> 07:37.518
another level person.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.554
He would come and see in a very gross way.

07:39.653 --> 07:41.705
He’d say, “Oh this one, it would be nice.

07:41.843 --> 07:43.587
And this is a stone and this is the thing.”

07:43.734 --> 07:45.194
and “This should not have been here

07:45.288 --> 07:46.907
and that should not have been there!”

07:47.017 --> 07:49.452
and “How much you paid for that?” It goes on, on like that.

07:49.534 --> 07:52.380
You see it goes on on like that you see.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.682
But a person who is divine,

07:54.955 --> 07:58.864
he may talk the way you are talking, but in that also its play

07:58.977 --> 08:01.122
the Divine is playing its part.

08:01.260 --> 08:04.046
It is just playing its part just to make a little,

08:04.149 --> 08:06.733
sort of a, hallucination for you.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.704
But inside that flow of the Divine

08:09.829 --> 08:12.773
it’s just to give you joy, to get you alright.

08:12.955 --> 08:15.855
Even when such a person scolds you or says something

08:15.958 --> 08:17.302
it has that manner.

08:17.383 --> 08:21.103
In the same manner if you make yourself very very subtle

08:21.251 --> 08:23.380
How? That any gross ideas come into you,

08:23.517 --> 08:25.749
“You just shut up! I don’t like you.”

08:25.900 --> 08:29.537
Gradually your mind will be so trained, I mean, it would be

08:29.685 --> 08:32.406
so much understanding the nectar of subtleness

08:32.508 --> 08:34.842
that it would reject automatically.

08:35.186 --> 08:37.686
You will live in this world but you will not feel it.

08:37.834 --> 08:40.294
That'd be the way you feel it, you will not be involved.

08:40.413 --> 08:42.100
You'll be eating food,  all right

08:42.180 --> 08:44.526
very good and very nicely this, that,

08:44.685 --> 08:47.460
but then you don't know what you are eating. You are just enjoying

08:47.618 --> 08:49.988
the love that is in that food.

08:50.469 --> 08:53.809
So to be subtle, to be that love,

08:54.093 --> 08:56.893
you see, your attention has to be on love.

08:57.261 --> 09:01.141
If your attention is guided by the price of the thing,

09:01.300 --> 09:03.143
the quality of the thing,

09:03.310 --> 09:06.736
and all that then that subtleness can not be.

09:07.960 --> 09:12.467
So to be subtle is also a mental activity after Sahaja Yoga.

09:13.915 --> 09:18.295
Now many people Sahaj they think is a standstill stuff - it is not.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.820
Sometimes you misunderstand the meaning of ‘Sahaj’.

09:21.930 --> 09:25.333
That is like a, first I say that

09:26.196 --> 09:28.729
the car will start sahaja, all right?

09:29.019 --> 09:31.085
But you put the accelerator on.

09:31.801 --> 09:34.021
You have to manoeuvre the thing,

09:34.158 --> 09:37.918
That is most Sahaja because you have become a Sahaj.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.792
If your attention is sahaja then automatically you’ll manage.

09:40.917 --> 09:42.597
When you have mastered

09:42.686 --> 09:46.337
the manoeuvring of the car you just do it automatically, sahaj.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.100
But to be that Sahaja you have to first of all try.

09:51.369 --> 09:53.093
If you don't learn that,

09:53.241 --> 09:56.697
then that will mean that you are just at a standstill.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.003
“Oh I have left it to Sahaj Yog,

09:59.105 --> 10:02.689
when the vibrations will come, they’ll come!” It won’t!

10:02.846 --> 10:05.205
Because there are still problems with you.

10:05.296 --> 10:06.922
You are not yet that subtle.

10:07.061 --> 10:10.875
So to remove that, now you can remove, to make yourself Sahaja.

10:10.996 --> 10:15.202
To cleanse yourself, absolutely, you have to work out a little.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.916
For example, now with vibrations like this you have an imbalance

10:20.019 --> 10:21.728
with the body, supposing,

10:21.830 --> 10:24.096
then you have to remove it. You know how to remove it.

10:24.211 --> 10:26.218
This is what has happened with Sahaja Yoga,

10:26.320 --> 10:28.065
that you know there is an imbalance,

10:28.134 --> 10:31.135
you know that my such chakra is catching, that this has happening.

10:31.249 --> 10:33.370
Now you bring it to the subtle point,

10:33.461 --> 10:36.998
[which] is first of all you have to work on it physically.

10:37.134 --> 10:38.134
All right?

10:38.480 --> 10:42.180
To make yourself absolutely clean there are so many ways.

10:42.340 --> 10:45.761
First and foremost is feeling the vibrations in different hands,

10:45.864 --> 10:48.698
feeling them, how it works out.  Which is more, which is less,

10:48.800 --> 10:51.940
how it’s coming. Why is it this thing?

10:52.180 --> 10:56.429
Then finding out, “How? Where did I catch it?” “All right,

10:56.497 --> 10:58.412
Such and such person!” Beat him with shoes.

10:58.606 --> 11:00.463
These are all gross things

11:00.611 --> 11:03.411
and have to be taken away by gross things.

11:03.681 --> 11:06.581
You beat them. For me I don't need any beating of it,

11:06.673 --> 11:08.765
only just looking at it, it runs away.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.270
If I have been there only itself runs away.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.313
I don't have to go ahead.  But for you people, you do catch.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.381
So for that reason you have to be careful:

11:17.483 --> 11:20.616
physically you have to work it out. So there’s so many ways.

11:20.810 --> 11:24.696
Like even, many people I was speaking say, “Oh we are now Realised,

11:24.809 --> 11:27.414
why should we sit in the water?” No!

11:27.587 --> 11:30.487
Everyday as we have a bath, we have to do it.

11:32.646 --> 11:35.262
Mother knows many things, you know.

11:35.804 --> 11:37.925
It’s a very good idea, you see.

11:38.051 --> 11:40.620
Just to avoid what is there?  “Now we are all right,

11:40.723 --> 11:42.956
you know, the vibrations we are getting in our had!”

11:43.048 --> 11:46.809
But you are not subtle! Still you catch from others.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.541
So all these physical things are to be done still.

11:52.700 --> 11:56.144
You need it because still it is, we should say, problem
[is sustained]

11:56.213 --> 11:58.759
so it is not yet absolutely perfectly a healthy person.

11:58.888 --> 12:01.278
So we have to do it, that’s one thing.

12:01.379 --> 12:03.921
Physically, whatever is the physical thing you know about.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.368
Even if you want you can take it out, like that,

12:06.455 --> 12:09.368
if there’s a problem. Now this fellow was nearly taken up like that

12:09.446 --> 12:10.494
You can!

12:10.621 --> 12:13.716
You want to pull it up. It does! It does work, it is symbolic.

12:13.947 --> 12:17.089
Every action. After all is a sahaja action.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.223
Nobody does like this.

12:20.183 --> 12:24.151
You do it. Because it’s hot and terrible you just take it out.

12:25.783 --> 12:29.023
If you see a realised-soul, a small little child,

12:29.216 --> 12:30.656
you'll be amazed.

12:30.883 --> 12:34.723
They will go to an airport, they will be going on like this.

12:34.905 --> 12:37.864
All the time they will be going on like this, on their own!

12:37.967 --> 12:39.833
You don't have to tell them.

12:40.001 --> 12:42.453
But for you, you must understand that,

12:42.578 --> 12:46.263
that state is still there, so that you must feel it.

12:46.362 --> 12:48.399
And you should really throw it away.

12:48.548 --> 12:50.548
Physically it has to be done.

12:50.690 --> 12:54.861
It’s an exercise and you cannot be ‘sahaja’ about it, no.

12:55.688 --> 12:58.033
There is a difference between Me and you,

12:58.149 --> 12:59.926
so you have to work it out.

13:00.053 --> 13:02.398
Whose who think they are realised - all right - finished!

13:02.478 --> 13:05.584
“Now we are on top of the world!” You should grow,

13:05.720 --> 13:08.620
evolve in understanding, and respect others,

13:09.358 --> 13:13.346
that, “No, we have to still rise and still rise and still rise.”

13:13.676 --> 13:16.620
This is a physical side, means very important.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.190
Then the second side is our mental side.

13:20.363 --> 13:23.548
Now mentally also all the time we are

13:23.662 --> 13:26.129
bombarded with things from all over.

13:26.271 --> 13:28.896
You read the newspaper in the morning, it's finished!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.677
You catch on your agnya, catch on your mooladhara

13:31.866 --> 13:34.564
— horrible thing it is. It’s a sadistic thing.

13:34.734 --> 13:37.112
If you see that you just get a fright,

13:37.215 --> 13:39.148
the way things are described.

13:39.267 --> 13:41.285
So what you have to do, mentally,

13:41.355 --> 13:43.116
you must understand these are horrid things.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.639
Now, you cannot say that,

13:44.718 --> 13:47.563
“I am innocent I am reading this, it's all right!” No, you catch.

13:47.689 --> 13:50.185
So what you [should] do is to put a bandhan.

13:50.362 --> 13:53.457
And if you want today to read, you read two lines,

13:53.583 --> 13:56.165
and if you think it's worth it, read it.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.147
Otherwise what’s the use reading pornography?

13:58.239 --> 14:01.071
That’s not meant for us. We are different people.

14:01.184 --> 14:03.484
You must know we are a different class.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.479
This is not meant for us at all.

14:05.604 --> 14:07.994
So what’s the use of reading anything that’s not going

14:08.081 --> 14:10.005
to give us pleasure? Read something pleasurable,

14:10.074 --> 14:11.116
something nice.

14:11.208 --> 14:14.243
Like the lecture of Sadat, I can say or something like that.

14:14.357 --> 14:16.720
Then you go to say, such things,

14:16.844 --> 14:19.458
or something like that, then you go ahead.

14:19.596 --> 14:23.009
And when you read it you support that person inside.

14:23.180 --> 14:25.399
But if you read pornography, you are caught

14:25.490 --> 14:27.290
and you become one of them.

14:27.837 --> 14:31.043
Because of the habits, just the old habits, you see.

14:31.213 --> 14:32.381
These are old habits.

14:32.507 --> 14:35.561
Anything that you see must you read? Not necessarily.

14:35.718 --> 14:38.108
You see people have habits of reading all the

14:38.195 --> 14:39.442
advertisements on the way.

14:39.582 --> 14:42.423
If they miss one they'll turn round to see that they didn’t miss it

14:42.559 --> 14:44.495
Another they’ll see this and this.

14:44.609 --> 14:46.128
These are the habits we have.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.941
So we have to make our attention subtler:

14:49.140 --> 14:51.250
“Oh where are you going?”

14:51.386 --> 14:54.617
So be alert about it. So mentally we have to be alert.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.649
Then another thing of mentally is to

14:57.764 --> 15:00.379
see what thoughts are coming to you.

15:00.491 --> 15:02.510
Still negative thoughts come to you,

15:02.613 --> 15:04.076
[there’s] no denying of the fact.

15:04.180 --> 15:06.320
May not be about Sahaj Yoga,

15:06.434 --> 15:08.223
but may be it's about something else,

15:08.382 --> 15:10.749
may be about something in life.

15:10.931 --> 15:13.597
You might be dreaming about such things.

15:13.883 --> 15:17.592
At that time what you have to do is to sit down

15:17.717 --> 15:20.914
and do a push with positive thoughts like,

15:21.118 --> 15:23.598
as I said a very good way they say [is] that,

15:23.678 --> 15:25.811
count your blessings one by one.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.059
Say, “How fortunate am I?

15:28.173 --> 15:31.460
In this world there are so many people.

15:31.755 --> 15:34.915
Out of that even in this London there are so many.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.917
Out of that I am the one who has found out really the Truth.

15:38.008 --> 15:39.486
How fortunate I am!

15:39.601 --> 15:43.039
And I am the one who is going on the right path, I feel it.

15:43.130 --> 15:44.410
And I am moving.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.459
If I have to move it on this path, let me be very, very positive.

15:48.550 --> 15:50.199
So let me move on this way.”

15:50.360 --> 15:52.565
When you start doing that you will be amazed

15:52.656 --> 15:54.867
that gradually these negative ideas will go away.

15:54.991 --> 15:57.883
Because even now you are attacked.

15:58.371 --> 16:01.827
You are very much attacked. And the ideas come to you.

16:02.469 --> 16:05.346
And then, as your habits are,

16:05.482 --> 16:07.817
because you are all the intelligent people,

16:07.966 --> 16:10.573
and brought up with this intelligent atmosphere,

16:10.676 --> 16:12.176
there are styles I have seen.

16:12.336 --> 16:14.929
The intelligent styles are very dangerous,

16:15.055 --> 16:17.492
they are more dangerous than foolish styles.

16:17.594 --> 16:19.802
The intelligent styles are that

16:19.973 --> 16:23.173
you take it in such a way that you cheat yourself.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.076
All the time you start accepting things

16:26.190 --> 16:27.867
and you start cheating yourself.

16:28.020 --> 16:32.164
And these ideas get sedimented in your being, gradually.

16:32.299 --> 16:35.108
And suddenly you find a big thing in your head

16:35.245 --> 16:37.467
and you say, “Oh, from where this has come in?

16:37.550 --> 16:39.400
What has happened to me?”

16:39.515 --> 16:40.759
So be careful!

16:40.873 --> 16:44.135
Because these sedimentations will be settling down in you,

16:44.251 --> 16:47.687
gradually. And you have had those habits

16:47.800 --> 16:50.010
of intelligent way of doing things.

16:50.113 --> 16:52.843
When you do intelligently? Actually what is intelligent doing,

16:52.934 --> 16:56.074
so many times, is just to push it upside down

16:56.182 --> 16:57.862
and bring it inside you.

16:57.982 --> 17:01.371
You can see this is something so funny but it is so,

17:01.452 --> 17:04.173
that when you deal with something intelligently

17:04.253 --> 17:05.986
you know how to escape it,

17:06.100 --> 17:07.629
and how to avoid it

17:07.754 --> 17:12.391
and how to make it look different to yourself.

17:12.548 --> 17:14.826
You yourself, with intelligence,

17:15.018 --> 17:17.521
deceive yourself and make it look different

17:17.612 --> 17:19.310
and then you accept that thing,

17:19.435 --> 17:21.326
and that becomes a part and parcel of you

17:21.423 --> 17:23.290
and you are not aware of it.

17:23.549 --> 17:27.569
Isn’t it Gregoire? It’s a common style, so be careful!

17:27.740 --> 17:31.611
When you start clearing out your Vishuddhi part of it,

17:31.713 --> 17:35.377
you will be surprised the subtleness will start flowing in you,

17:35.547 --> 17:39.841
the subtleness will appear before you. The subtleness is a state.

17:40.022 --> 17:42.437
It is a state of your attention.

17:42.710 --> 17:44.896
Your attention is gross outside.

17:45.010 --> 17:47.617
Now you think of some sort of

17:47.743 --> 17:50.327
a moon which is just a stone you can call it.

17:50.476 --> 17:54.838
Then it starts little bit moving, becomes little,

17:54.942 --> 17:59.045
I should say, mobile, then gradually it becomes subtle.

17:59.237 --> 18:03.044
The core is melting away, the outside is still hard.

18:03.181 --> 18:06.505
It’s like that is your attention. It starts melting in you.

18:06.620 --> 18:10.801
Now you are in the core, you are not outside,

18:10.949 --> 18:12.737
but whenever you come in contact,

18:12.859 --> 18:15.164
the core part contacts with the gross,

18:15.271 --> 18:17.397
suddenly you start becoming one with it,

18:17.500 --> 18:20.710
then the crust starts again becoming

18:20.813 --> 18:23.704
an immobile stuff and the core starts becoming strong.

18:23.806 --> 18:25.674
Again you increase the core,

18:25.788 --> 18:28.973
it starts again to go out to periphery and the things stars melting

18:29.109 --> 18:31.730
That is how the attention, if you can understand, is.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.299
And that attention, which is enlightened in you,

18:34.390 --> 18:36.646
has to be kept all the time enlightened:

18:36.725 --> 18:38.556
no justification with yourself!

18:38.693 --> 18:41.529
With others also we don't have to justify.

18:41.655 --> 18:42.855
It’s all right.

18:43.178 --> 18:46.327
We think that we must grow, we must be all right,

18:46.452 --> 18:50.690
we must be very good and when we find somebody is troubling us,

18:50.803 --> 18:54.782
it’s rather difficult to tolerate a nonsense like that, it’s true.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.664
But, for that, I am sitting down, you just tell me

18:57.789 --> 18:59.874
and I can manage it! You have seen

18:59.954 --> 19:01.957
[how] we have solved one problem very nicely,

19:02.036 --> 19:03.654
and we can solve all the problems.

19:03.753 --> 19:06.335
It’s a very clever way, isn't it? That the subtle way!

19:06.460 --> 19:08.060
It just gets solved!

19:08.232 --> 19:10.656
So we don’t have to worry about anything.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.037
You don’t have to think a 100 times!

19:13.138 --> 19:15.368
Though I am the person who has put you in problems you see,

19:15.473 --> 19:17.580
“Do like this! You should have done like this!

19:17.659 --> 19:19.631
You should have put in effort like this!”

19:19.713 --> 19:21.763
But the problem I will be solving myself, you see.

19:21.867 --> 19:24.464
But I will just make you run up and down to see that.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.305
On the contrary when you see me doing like that

19:27.376 --> 19:29.659
you should understand I am I am playing tricks with you!

19:29.740 --> 19:32.969
So the problems can be solved just like that,

19:33.060 --> 19:34.993
if your attention is subtle.

19:35.281 --> 19:38.289
But if it is not the main the basic problem is

19:38.457 --> 19:40.457
that you cannot approach this.

19:41.361 --> 19:44.137
The approach to the problem is only possible

19:44.285 --> 19:46.130
if you are a subtle being.

19:46.232 --> 19:50.200
If you are not a subtle being you cannot approach any problem.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.461
So, to be subtle and to be there, to be Divine

19:55.598 --> 19:59.246
one has to understand the grossness that is covering you.

19:59.369 --> 20:00.852
Through Kundalini you can

20:00.955 --> 20:04.410
because you can raise your Kundalini, see where it is hanging.

20:04.534 --> 20:07.131
“Now it’s very heavy here. It’s like a stone here.

20:07.245 --> 20:08.867
It’s thumping here.

20:09.024 --> 20:10.983
It’s doing all these things.”

20:11.086 --> 20:13.466
Now, it’s a very gross way of looking at it,

20:13.568 --> 20:16.357
very gross way of looking at it. It is suggesting to you,

20:16.437 --> 20:17.437
something.

20:17.543 --> 20:22.030
So what you have to do is to see for yourself now, at Sahasrara,

20:22.121 --> 20:24.721
that’s the place for Somebody we know.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.577
Then you just sit down and say, “Now what have I done?

20:28.866 --> 20:30.723
Why this problem?

20:31.641 --> 20:35.867
If I have done anything like that, please forgive me!”

20:36.015 --> 20:39.019
It works out. It’s a simple way.

20:39.152 --> 20:41.613
But first of all, foremost thing, is that,

20:41.756 --> 20:43.480
what is the substance you gave me?

20:43.582 --> 20:47.294
Is it a subtle substance that’s speaking or the gross one?

20:48.941 --> 20:52.295
From which point are you speaking is the thing.

20:52.442 --> 20:55.070
Supposing you are speaking from that point

20:55.184 --> 20:58.156
where you are a governor general, everybody has to obey you!

20:58.304 --> 21:01.487
But if you are speaking from the point where you are a peon,

21:01.612 --> 21:03.478
nobody is going to obey you.

21:03.778 --> 21:06.157
So where is the attention is the thing.

21:06.249 --> 21:09.285
So mentally you have to work it out in your meditation.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.039
Now you sit down for meditation, all right,

21:12.152 --> 21:14.599
mostly trying to be thoughtlessly aware.

21:14.690 --> 21:18.482
But if there are thoughts you should try to keep it down by saying,

21:18.590 --> 21:22.356
“How fortunate that I have felt these vibrations, I felt it.

21:22.465 --> 21:24.525
And how happy I am about it!

21:24.617 --> 21:26.483
Now you get away all the negative thoughts!”

21:26.574 --> 21:27.996
That’s how you can fight it out.

21:28.059 --> 21:32.013
Now whatever you do will lead you to Sahaja, not before.

21:32.184 --> 21:34.811
Before Realisation it has got no meaning, it was a dead car

21:34.937 --> 21:37.976
standing there, but now the car has started moving.

21:38.088 --> 21:41.022
And whatever you do whatever you try,

21:41.135 --> 21:43.556
it will make you subtler and subtler.

21:43.660 --> 21:46.310
Simple things like declaration that,

21:46.424 --> 21:49.880
“Yes, I am going to do this! I have decided to do it.”

21:50.063 --> 21:53.305
Put your mind to positive thinking: What are we going to do?

21:53.420 --> 21:56.720
How are we going to do it? How are we going to work it out?

21:56.841 --> 21:59.313
You will be surprised how the things will come.

21:59.392 --> 22:02.656
But normally our habits are for our gross problems.

22:04.556 --> 22:07.524
Now I would say Bombay Sahaja Yogis are

22:07.638 --> 22:10.038
quite developed they are quite good

22:10.133 --> 22:12.711
but still sometimes they really tumbled down very badly.

22:12.813 --> 22:15.561
This time I thought they were a little bit proud

22:15.679 --> 22:18.094
than anything else because Delhi people were not so good at

22:18.197 --> 22:20.949
things and they had to come and do it.

22:21.108 --> 22:23.872
And I think that Bombay people did feel that they were

22:23.974 --> 22:28.237
sort of lending a hand to Delhi people. It happened.

22:28.657 --> 22:33.487
But then they found themselves quite low

22:33.601 --> 22:37.698
and and all of them Humpty Dumpties sitting down there!

22:37.809 --> 22:40.029
You see, so it can happen.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.922
So anyone who feels that,

22:42.024 --> 22:44.790
“I have achieved everything!” or, “I have reached everything!”

22:44.892 --> 22:46.798
can have a Humpty Dumpty fall.

22:46.924 --> 22:49.710
Because it was so beautifully played, you see.

22:49.858 --> 22:52.815
I'll tell you what happened: They came down

22:52.996 --> 22:56.708
and then in the Old Delhi we had no place to stay properly

22:56.874 --> 22:59.774
so I said, “All right, you arrange my place in the guesthouse

22:59.888 --> 23:01.702
and the boys can stay in the boys hostel

23:01.804 --> 23:03.639
and the girls can stay in the girls hostel.”

23:03.765 --> 23:05.771
“All right it can be done.”

23:06.383 --> 23:08.773
So then the gross thing came out.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.868
So one of the persons said that,

23:10.970 --> 23:13.486
“You see but the food in that boys hostel is full of oil

23:13.578 --> 23:18.033
and this and how can we eat there?”

23:20.277 --> 23:23.474
And I didn’t know about it, nobody told me.

23:23.656 --> 23:26.375
And then they had to arrange it with somebody

23:26.466 --> 23:28.867
and they had to suddenly purchase all the food

23:28.947 --> 23:32.416
and everything and then to arrange a cook and these things.

23:32.540 --> 23:36.063
And where they stayed was all full of bhoots!

23:36.437 --> 23:39.351
And they were all caught up in the head, terrible

23:39.454 --> 23:41.847
and this and that and they came to me.

23:41.951 --> 23:44.091
So they said, “Mother what has happened to us?

23:44.192 --> 23:46.449
We came all the way and this is what has happened.

23:46.530 --> 23:48.336
Now we are all vomiting and this and that.”

23:48.485 --> 23:50.946
I said, “Why? Where are you eating these days?

23:51.049 --> 23:53.101
Not in that oily place?”

23:53.486 --> 23:56.298
“No, we have our own cook we have our everything,

23:56.400 --> 23:58.645
but the problem is the house is full of bhoots and

23:58.759 --> 24:00.791
we are all finished with that!”

24:00.881 --> 24:02.795
So I said, “Who had asked you to suggest that?

24:02.910 --> 24:04.258
Can't you eat that food?

24:04.338 --> 24:06.256
So many thousands of boys are eating here.

24:06.367 --> 24:08.893
You are Sahaja Yogis you can't eat that food?

24:09.007 --> 24:11.340
Your attention is on the oily food

24:11.422 --> 24:14.176
what is so special about yourselves that you can't eat?

24:14.300 --> 24:17.608
I mean you should be able to eat even the stones.

24:17.688 --> 24:19.377
That’s what Sahaja Yoga is

24:19.445 --> 24:22.166
but you can’t eat the ordinary food that all so many

24:22.245 --> 24:23.978
thousands of boys are eating?

24:24.070 --> 24:26.811
And you wanted to stay away - such importance of yourself,

24:26.959 --> 24:30.287
so go ahead!” And it was all done by satanic forces.

24:30.392 --> 24:32.339
You should have thought once at least that,

24:32.442 --> 24:35.729
“Why are we wanting to go away from here that place?

24:35.854 --> 24:39.950
When where it is all organised, let us be here!” That is Sahaja.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.972
That part also they didn’t understand

24:43.052 --> 24:45.694
— discrimination also of what is Sahaja what is asahaja?

24:45.820 --> 24:47.983
Where are you Sahaja and where are you not,

24:48.087 --> 24:50.874
you should discriminate it. That point at least one should reach.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.362
So the so called, the high, top class

24:53.453 --> 24:57.338
Sahaja Yogis fell down like that, and they felt very shy and bad.

24:57.428 --> 25:01.316
I said, “It’s all right, don't you worry.” But it’s a simple thing.

25:01.453 --> 25:02.785
It's a lesson now.

25:02.899 --> 25:06.017
Because you can overcome [the] food problem

25:06.130 --> 25:07.930
but what about the bhoots?

25:08.080 --> 25:09.679
Why should you go in with somebody,

25:09.770 --> 25:11.685
a person who has just come to Sahaja Yoga,

25:11.765 --> 25:13.796
and you don't know what sort of person he is?

25:13.897 --> 25:15.731
They said, “Mother, it's your Maya!”

25:15.848 --> 25:18.622
I said, “But what about you? You people were thinking that you are

25:18.690 --> 25:21.683
great and you are the greatest Sahaj Yogis ever born,

25:21.785 --> 25:24.685
and you are the topmost among all the worlds!

25:24.980 --> 25:26.576
So don’t think like this.”

25:26.725 --> 25:29.229
And this is what happened. You see, so it plays on you,

25:29.331 --> 25:31.798
just to test you and it works on you.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.959
So, ‘sahaja’ means whatever comes your way you take it, no doubt,

25:36.083 --> 25:39.904
but you do it yourself with positiveness. That is very necessary.

25:40.020 --> 25:42.580
That doesn’t mean that you go on accepting everything ‘sahaja’ :

25:42.637 --> 25:45.085
“The bhoots coming onto me, I’m accepting, everything

25:45.176 --> 25:46.627
coming onto me I am accepting.

25:46.696 --> 25:49.110
That is not the way it is Sahaja, that’s the point.

25:49.220 --> 25:52.627
When we start doing like that, then

25:52.797 --> 25:55.348
actually ‘sahaja’ what you will get is bhoots,

25:55.473 --> 25:57.649
and what you will get is all the negativity,

25:57.775 --> 26:01.343
and also you’ll get all the sickness, illness, everything.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.273
You have to be careful.

26:03.707 --> 26:06.823
So mentally you should be alert.

26:07.436 --> 26:09.702
Physically you should work it out.

26:10.020 --> 26:13.056
And physically there is another point:

26:13.181 --> 26:16.378
is that you must look after your bodies, physically,

26:16.469 --> 26:18.336
[it’s] very much necessary,

26:18.441 --> 26:20.686
because this body is the temple of God.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.933
It is definitely now the temple.

26:23.440 --> 26:28.416
It’s a shrine. See how beautiful a shrine you have got.

26:29.391 --> 26:31.724
And I love to reside in this place.

26:32.418 --> 26:35.678
Let it be so beautiful that God should reside in that.

26:35.803 --> 26:39.510
Beautiful it is. Look after your body, look after your hair,

26:39.612 --> 26:43.602
look after yourself. If you treat yourself there’s no harm.

26:43.726 --> 26:46.036
People might say that, “Why should I treat myself?

26:46.127 --> 26:47.918
I must take all the burdens on myself!”

26:48.021 --> 26:52.147
All these out of date ideas of sufferings are useless for Sahaj Yog

26:52.250 --> 26:55.946
Nobody has to suffer.  You have to be very, very healthy people.

26:56.060 --> 26:58.302
Like somebody said that, “Why is it that Ramkrishna

26:58.393 --> 27:00.336
Paramahansa did not cure himself?

27:00.444 --> 27:03.230
Because he did not know how to cure himself, first of all.

27:03.956 --> 27:08.180
But Ramkrishna said, “I want to take all the burdens on my head.”

27:08.265 --> 27:11.632
You don't get sick if somebody who is sick you do not get sick.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.456
But, the only thing is that, if you look after your body,

27:14.546 --> 27:17.595
you respect your body, then your body also respects you.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.920
You body understands! If you don’t care for your body,

27:21.073 --> 27:23.099
you neglect your body, then body also says,

27:23.202 --> 27:25.135
“All right I'll have my way!”

27:25.282 --> 27:27.694
So you have to look after your body.

27:27.806 --> 27:29.894
You have to know how to keep it all right.

27:30.018 --> 27:32.149
I think we should really write it down,

27:32.243 --> 27:34.736
all the things that are to be done to look after your body.

27:34.848 --> 27:38.436
That is very important, because in these modern

27:38.537 --> 27:42.015
times or modern society, of course, you have devised ways

27:42.140 --> 27:44.870
of comfort that you press here,

27:45.006 --> 27:46.865
then you get everything coming down,

27:46.968 --> 27:49.073
you press there and you get food inside your stomach

27:49.164 --> 27:50.580
and all that is there.

27:50.739 --> 27:55.102
Not everywhere this is! That is all comfort they call it

27:55.193 --> 27:58.015
but I call it lethargy, or can call it laziness.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.416
It is not going to give you good health.

28:00.530 --> 28:03.861
Good health is possible only if you understand the balancing

28:03.975 --> 28:06.004
and have every understanding about

28:06.095 --> 28:08.362
how the body acts and what happens to body:

28:08.465 --> 28:11.617
small, small things like hot and cool, cold and hot.

28:11.708 --> 28:13.856
This is very important for Sahaj Yoga.

28:13.970 --> 28:16.983
You see Sahaja Yogis have to be perfect,

28:17.709 --> 28:19.309
absolutely perfect.

28:19.693 --> 28:23.332
And you don’t have to do with the norms of the modern times that

28:23.435 --> 28:26.682
everybody should be thin and everybody should be absolutely

28:26.920 --> 28:31.977
a TB patient going down for some sort of beauty parade!

28:32.780 --> 28:36.133
You should be all very healthy people and impressive.

28:36.326 --> 28:39.070
Whenever you sit there people should literally

28:39.184 --> 28:40.984
be frightened of you that,

28:41.110 --> 28:43.710
“From where these wrestlers have come?”

28:45.780 --> 28:52.228
So this is the sign of attending to your health attending yourself

28:52.884 --> 28:54.751
and your mental health also.

28:54.881 --> 28:57.928
And that’s why I say that you [should] be that you careful as to

28:58.054 --> 29:00.649
what you read and what you see and what you hear

29:00.797 --> 29:02.701
and how much attention you pay to it.

29:02.781 --> 29:05.409
You see supposing now a person like David comes here:

29:05.489 --> 29:07.703
you pay too much attention to a man like that.

29:07.773 --> 29:09.538
Everything is filled with that,

29:09.595 --> 29:11.307
the whole atmosphere is talking about it.

29:11.387 --> 29:15.547
Everybody is worried about it, it is all going on. It’s negative.

29:15.740 --> 29:18.345
I think you talked more about David than about me

29:18.436 --> 29:21.712
at that time. Because I have also come, but David was there.

29:21.814 --> 29:24.095
But [this] sort of thing, it happens.

29:24.200 --> 29:27.492
Because we are used to seeing a thing like a sensational

29:27.606 --> 29:30.156
thing coming up, you see. Like newspapers will always publish

29:30.293 --> 29:32.716
something sensational. We are used to a sensation.

29:32.889 --> 29:35.346
So Mr. David was quite important.

29:35.449 --> 29:38.940
But just see how unimportant he was — he’s just disappeared.

29:39.066 --> 29:42.657
So if you had just neglected him, not bothered very much paying

29:42.816 --> 29:44.992
attention to him very much.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.701
I hope Cooly is not too long with…

29:48.860 --> 29:54.900
You see, I don't want Cooly to be curing him and get into trouble.

29:55.104 --> 29:56.104
All right.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.782
So the regular habits of sitting in the water

30:14.897 --> 30:16.445
and all that should be done.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.972
Also regular habits about your mind:

30:19.109 --> 30:20.979
is not to read this. Just avoid!

30:21.059 --> 30:23.376
You don’t want to read any more of these things.

30:23.553 --> 30:25.874
There are so many beautiful books you can read.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.593
If you have to read and if you are used to it,

30:28.707 --> 30:31.326
you can read beautiful books.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.296
I have told you so many of them are there.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.187
You can read The Bible and see for yourself

30:36.268 --> 30:39.056
that it is all Sahaja, every word.

30:39.145 --> 30:41.409
You can find out so many quotations and so many things

30:41.512 --> 30:43.575
which can help us to tell these Christians,

30:43.643 --> 30:45.730
otherwise they are not going to listen to this,

30:45.855 --> 30:47.916
they are such conformed sort of things,

30:48.013 --> 30:49.944
that you have to tell something from The Bible.

30:50.059 --> 30:52.562
You can read Koran, you can read other books like

30:52.653 --> 30:55.981
Khalil Gibran and things, which are supporting you,

30:56.099 --> 30:59.761
which are also helping you which are giving you ideas.

31:00.180 --> 31:02.898
Are you all right? You sure?

31:03.896 --> 31:08.248
I think better put your left hand towards me and right hand outside
