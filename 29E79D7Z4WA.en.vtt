00:04:55.176 --> 00:05:01.698
The other day I told you about the center of Christ

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:05.222
and center of Shri Krishna

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:07.841
and their relationship with each other.

00:05:10.012 --> 00:05:13.334
Now the last and the most important center

00:05:13.562 --> 00:05:22.576
one within us is the center of Sahasrara is the limbic area.

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.540
When you enter into it you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:05:29.442 --> 00:05:33.230
This is the area to be entered through the Kundalini,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.730
through the center of Christ,

00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:40.127
through the Gate of Christ and that's why is written

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:44.543
that you have to enter through Him.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.244
But not by somebody else saying, "I'm the Christ" or

00:05:49.342 --> 00:05:52.005
saying, "I profess Christ and Christ"

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:54.505
It's not that way. Christ is within us

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.657
and when the Kundalini rises,

00:05:59.157 --> 00:06:01.157
if it stops at this center,

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.969
you have to take His name. Not

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:09.308
the people who are not realized, but realized people have to chant His name,

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:14.369
then only the Kundalini pierces through that center of Christ,

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.133
that's the door, that's the gate He's talked about,

00:06:19.856 --> 00:06:22.387
and then you enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:31.009
"Thou shalt inherit the Kingdom of God." Inherit.

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.509
That's your Father's Kingdom

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:36.723
and that you have to inherit.

00:06:38.116 --> 00:06:42.750
But now the most important is the last center of Sahasrara.

00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:49.495
When you have all the seven centers placed one after another,

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:53.545
these centers are really the seats

00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:56.045
of all the Deities we have talked about.

00:06:58.048 --> 00:07:00.737
The seats are in the brain,

00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:03.676
their aura is around the heart

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:08.671
but they are actually sleeping in the

00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:13.496
"Sthanas" as we call, the places of centers.

00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:18.392
So, it is in three ways you can understand. One,

00:07:19.253 --> 00:07:23.866
in the brain, there are seven centers of the seats

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:28.475
and their auras are falling on the heart.

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:37.764
Their places are in the center.

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:42.154
And the first stage of the awakening of the Kundalini

00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:44.654
only these Deities get awakened.

00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:50.360
That means when you chant any word or you call Them by name,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.557
They react. In the sense They open the chakras. You can

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:57.100
feel it; you can see it

00:07:57.266 --> 00:08:00.107
clearly with your own eyes the Kundalini rising through them.

00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:04.504
Then later on, when you grow more and more,

00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:10.256
these Deities leave Their places and occupy Their seats

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:14.228
and even the Spirit, which is in the heart,

00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:16.537
comes up here

00:08:16.798 --> 00:08:19.912
on the fontanel bone area where there is the heart,

00:08:20.412 --> 00:08:26.319
seat of the heart center, which is the heart here, opened goes there.

00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:29.360
But it is at a much later state,

00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:35.362
that state at a much later time, we can say much later

00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:37.747
state of your mind it's a,

00:08:37.903 --> 00:08:39.763
you get into that speed

00:08:40.263 --> 00:08:43.068
in which you just achieve that state.

00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:45.132
It is an achievement.

00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:49.639
It cannot be a false certificate from somebody or one can say this is written

00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:51.433
in the book. So this and this.

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:53.226
There's no calculation like that.

00:08:53.726 --> 00:08:56.599
It has to mature in its living way

00:08:56.707 --> 00:08:59.351
and you yourself will know

00:08:59.403 --> 00:09:02.317
that you have got now complete Self-realization.

00:09:03.936 --> 00:09:07.675
First thing you get is thoughtless awareness.

00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:12.103
With this you cross the Gate of Christ.

00:09:12.603 --> 00:09:15.867
You can cure people, you can raise the Kundalini.

00:09:16.367 --> 00:09:19.288
You may also be able to give Realization to people.

00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:22.804
But still you are capable of falling out.

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:26.542
Supposing somebody, a person comes

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:30.797
with negative forces and fanaticism

00:09:30.989 --> 00:09:35.001
he may encompass you. And you may go down.

00:09:36.052 --> 00:09:40.044
But the second state is called as the doubtless awareness.

00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:44.139
If you rise into that then you have no doubts whatsoever.

00:09:44.832 --> 00:09:48.610
You never fall down. Maybe your Kundalini comes and goes and

00:09:48.807 --> 00:09:51.791
supplies and sometimes you can feel the catches, it's all right.

00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:53.521
But after that,

00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:56.021
you are so sure of yourself

00:09:56.769 --> 00:10:01.113
and of your achievement, your Self-Realization that you never falloff.

00:10:02.798 --> 00:10:06.185
But the last one is the very important thing

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.181
where many Sahaja yogis also falter,

00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.212
is the integration.

00:10:12.098 --> 00:10:14.738
For example, a somebody's born a Christian,

00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:16.804
he's born.

00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:19.740
He could have been born a Hindu; he could have been born anything.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.464
He could have been Muslim.

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:23.633
Muslim I have seen one fanatic,

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:26.241
like a Muslim if he a fanatic he is

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:28.385
born today as a fanatic Hindu

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:29.699
or a fanatic Christian,

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:31.506
these are all fanatics.

00:10:31.675 --> 00:10:34.501
They go from one swing to another swing and they profess.

00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:36.393
He will have Koran in his hand,

00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:39.618
this fellow will have Bible in his hand and another will have Gita in his hand,

00:10:39.677 --> 00:10:40.795
three of them are fighting.

00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:44.348
He says I'm correct, he says I'm correct and he says I'm correct.

00:10:44.572 --> 00:10:45.853
Now what is the authority?

00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:49.206
Even of these books people will ask what is the authority of the Bible.

00:10:50.064 --> 00:10:51.844
What is the authority of the Gita

00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:54.016
and what is the authority of the Koran?

00:10:54.047 --> 00:10:56.047
They'll say what is the authority of The Old Testament?

00:10:56.547 --> 00:10:59.147
If they ask authority, what is the answer?

00:10:59.344 --> 00:11:01.344
And you can ask what is my authority?

00:11:02.175 --> 00:11:04.175
You must ask this question.

00:11:04.675 --> 00:11:07.173
In the beginning people do ask what is my authority.

00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:09.950
My authority is that I give you Realization.

00:11:10.643 --> 00:11:13.575
And you ask the question, "Mother are you the authority?"

00:11:13.744 --> 00:11:15.744
you get vibrations.

00:11:16.244 --> 00:11:17.851
This is my authority.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.851
Then you will understand why Bible is right, Koran is right and Gita is right.

00:11:24.013 --> 00:11:26.013
Because of the narrow vision we have.

00:11:26.513 --> 00:11:29.067
If they are born as a Christian then they'll stick into it.

00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:31.536
If you are Catholics you will be Protestants, if you are

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:32.916
Protestants you'll become

00:11:32.947 --> 00:11:35.145
a 7th Day Adventist, Pentecostals,

00:11:35.176 --> 00:11:37.423
this that, born again, this that nonsense

00:11:37.592 --> 00:11:42.001
we go on ending up like that in a Christian genealogy,

00:11:42.308 --> 00:11:45.103
from one madness to another madness achieving nothing,

00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:47.272
believing into some sort of a theoretical thing

00:11:48.627 --> 00:11:50.377
like 7th Day Adventist.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.688
I can't understand it.

00:11:53.719 --> 00:11:56.218
These theories and these things are not going to give you

00:11:56.387 --> 00:11:58.387
living experience,

00:11:58.446 --> 00:12:01.402
which is beyond rationality, which is beyond mind,

00:12:01.461 --> 00:12:04.531
which is Baptism, the real sense of the word,

00:12:04.618 --> 00:12:07.897
where you get this breeze in the hand, of the Holy Spirit.

00:12:09.252 --> 00:12:12.931
But we want to play about with these things with our narrow visions now see

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.100
one case of Christ.

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.755
Christ was definitely, as I told you, was

00:12:19.784 --> 00:12:21.784
Pranava, Omkara, everything was there,

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:23.445
no doubt.

00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:27.080
But when He was born,

00:12:27.992 --> 00:12:29.992
there was signs and everything.

00:12:30.492 --> 00:12:33.377
Despite all that there was a king who wanted to kill Him.

00:12:35.133 --> 00:12:40.284
See the negativity. No intellectual accepted Him.

00:12:40.431 --> 00:12:42.431
No bureaucrat accepted Him,

00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:45.478
no educated person accepted Him.

00:12:45.585 --> 00:12:48.137
He had to actually beg of those

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:52.387
very ordinary, mediocre people

00:12:53.024 --> 00:12:56.053
like fishermen to come and become His disciples.

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.854
See the situation.

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.410
And He was allowed to live

00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:02.019
only for 4 years

00:13:02.068 --> 00:13:03.533
by these horrible people.

00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:05.875
They may be born today as Christians and must be saying we are

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:08.460
Christians and Christ and Christ and Christ.

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:10.848
That's why Christ has said I will not recognize you.

00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:16.260
They might be the people who might have crucified Christ.

00:13:16.466 --> 00:13:18.248
And they're again crucifying Him

00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:21.140
by denying the living force of the living God.

00:13:24.427 --> 00:13:25.364
Four years.

00:13:25.432 --> 00:13:27.573
Now, what can you do in four years? I told you

00:13:27.601 --> 00:13:31.531
four years, with all my powers, I was struggling with six hippies

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.090
giving them realization in London city.

00:13:36.631 --> 00:13:39.300
He never even thought of giving Realization because He thought

00:13:39.349 --> 00:13:42.307
first of all they have no brains even to understand what is Realization.

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:45.470
Whatever He said,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.755
He said it very precise and deep.

00:13:47.823 --> 00:13:49.823
If anything that is narrow has to be deep.

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:53.943
Which cannot go into the heads of people who just listen to

00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:55.113
sermons and lectures

00:13:55.142 --> 00:13:59.481
and read books and sort of have big theories built up into anything.

00:14:00.413 --> 00:14:03.695
It will only be possible when you get your Realization,

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:08.940
when you get your collective consciousness, when you become baptized.

00:14:08.989 --> 00:14:13.244
Then only you will be able to see what He talked about.

00:14:13.528 --> 00:14:15.706
Before that it's only mental activity,

00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:18.827
quarrelling, fighting and living on artificial things.

00:14:19.327 --> 00:14:20.947
How long are you going to do like that?

00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:24.807
Your forefathers did it and their forefathers did it and their

00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:26.302
forefathers have done it.

00:14:27.312 --> 00:14:29.312
Now is it not time for you

00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:31.812
to see that a new age has come?

00:14:33.568 --> 00:14:35.217
What are you going to lose by that?

00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:37.085
You form organizations

00:14:37.134 --> 00:14:39.134
false and false and false.

00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:41.536
There should be some honesty about it.

00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:45.749
Just talking talking morning till evening,

00:14:45.798 --> 00:14:48.702
you are not going to receive any knowledge about Christ I can tell you.

00:14:51.715 --> 00:14:53.715
This narrow vision of Christianity

00:14:55.844 --> 00:14:59.088
has killed Christ and Christianity good.

00:14:59.352 --> 00:15:01.352
The narrow vision of Jews

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.005
has killed Moses and Abraham.

00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:06.289
The narrow vision of Krishna

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.911
and the narrow vision of all these people

00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:12.537
has killed them.

00:15:13.698 --> 00:15:16.532
They have dead in them. Your children are going to challenge you.

00:15:17.032 --> 00:15:18.287
They are going to ask you,

00:15:18.296 --> 00:15:21.011
what foolish things you have been doing all your lives.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.039
They are going to ask you why did you do it?

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:29.539
Have you any answer to give?

00:15:31.354 --> 00:15:34.170
For that one has to understand

00:15:34.914 --> 00:15:36.914
that we have now found our absolute.

00:15:37.884 --> 00:15:40.367
You be honest yourself. Have you found your absolute?

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:43.041
We have not yet found our absolute.

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:45.819
That's what you have to find.

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:49.494
You are to be born again. Not to certificate yourself that

00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:51.524
I am born again. I have seen many people,

00:15:51.589 --> 00:15:53.920
I am born again. Really? How do you say?

00:15:55.082 --> 00:15:57.658
Can you feel the chakras of another person?

00:15:57.688 --> 00:16:00.277
Are you collectively conscious? Can you feel your own chakras?

00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:01.979
Can you clarify yourself is there any

00:16:02.009 --> 00:16:03.921
transformation? No transformation.

00:16:06.058 --> 00:16:08.058
Then you have among Jews also

00:16:08.419 --> 00:16:10.750
very fanatic people. Muslims

00:16:13.357 --> 00:16:14.254
have lost

00:16:15.816 --> 00:16:19.391
even the recognition of God's

00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:21.527
mercy and compassion.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.686
It is such a sad state. At this

00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:29.395
sad state and confusion,

00:16:29.895 --> 00:16:31.267
there has to be

00:16:32.377 --> 00:16:34.115
the integrating force.

00:16:34.162 --> 00:16:36.861
And that integrating force is your Spirit.

00:16:38.075 --> 00:16:41.783
That integration takes place in this seventh chakra of Sahasrara.

00:16:43.067 --> 00:16:45.067
All the seven centers are there

00:16:45.654 --> 00:16:49.380
and all the centers are coordinated and co-related

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.896
and that's how, at the seventh chakra only you can get your Realization.

00:16:56.921 --> 00:16:59.256
He didn't allow any one of them

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:00.986
to say anything about it.

00:17:02.204 --> 00:17:04.854
If they try to say anything you brake bright out of the book,

00:17:04.936 --> 00:17:06.883
oh see this book is written it is written

00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:08.895
in so and so and this is written so and so.

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:11.395
Say for example when Christ was born.

00:17:13.044 --> 00:17:15.044
It was said that

00:17:16.258 --> 00:17:19.250
a child will be born to a girl.

00:17:20.673 --> 00:17:23.357
Kanya. In Sanskrit language it's Kanya.

00:17:25.303 --> 00:17:27.705
Now in England there was a controversy about it,

00:17:27.752 --> 00:17:30.630
Now I think the Jews started it maybe, I don't know who started it.

00:17:30.747 --> 00:17:32.343
Or maybe the Muslims.

00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:36.794
God only knows. They go into all these details of that thing to find out

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:38.386
they said it was not said

00:17:38.555 --> 00:17:41.696
that He will be born of virgin but it was said of the girl.

00:17:43.502 --> 00:17:46.363
So one of the Sahaja yogi wrote a nice letter to them,

00:17:46.393 --> 00:17:47.905
of course under my guidance

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.546
saying that

00:17:49.698 --> 00:17:52.413
at the time when Christ was born, even before that,

00:17:53.313 --> 00:17:55.437
this prophecy was made and that time,

00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:57.676
a girl meant a virgin.

00:17:58.054 --> 00:17:59.806
These are not modern times when

00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:01.203
a woman who is divorced

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.063
10 times and 80 years

00:18:04.093 --> 00:18:06.895
is her age, and she's still called as 'my girl'.

00:18:08.614 --> 00:18:10.843
These are foolish stupid modern times

00:18:11.169 --> 00:18:14.853
where there's no difference between a girl and a woman.

00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:18.311
That time a girl meant,

00:18:18.487 --> 00:18:20.898
even today in India, Kanya means a virgin.

00:18:22.478 --> 00:18:25.018
Girl means a virgin. It's the same thing.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.903
All such things have been raised against

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.468
either Christ or Moses or Mohammad or this and that.

00:18:35.529 --> 00:18:37.690
I mean there only busy

00:18:37.805 --> 00:18:40.641
raising things against each other, that's what they are doing.

00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:44.957
According to them, what they say is the truth? What have they found?

00:18:47.141 --> 00:18:49.141
First thing, can they cure cancer?

00:18:53.448 --> 00:18:56.503
Let's see, let's have this challenge.

00:18:57.407 --> 00:19:00.449
Can they give peace to anyone? Are they peaceful?

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.529
Have they been able to get over their adulterous eyes?

00:19:07.924 --> 00:19:09.294
Any transformation?

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:11.195
Nothing.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.690
So accept it. Be honest with yourself.

00:19:16.015 --> 00:19:19.975
You have no business to cheat yourself, or anything whatsoever.

00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:23.247
If you are hypnotized

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:25.747
awaken yourself.

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:29.724
arise and find what is the best,

00:19:30.557 --> 00:19:35.560
absolute and the only thing that you have to find, your Spirit.

00:19:37.762 --> 00:19:40.540
Your Spirit resides in the heart.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.315
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.964
It enjoys itself, by itself.

00:19:52.429 --> 00:19:56.604
It is the spectator of the world, of its power,

00:19:58.139 --> 00:19:59.090
The Holy Ghost.

00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:04.308
It watches you

00:20:05.896 --> 00:20:08.511
and is called as the knower of the fate.

00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:13.496
It knows what you are doing,

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:16.259
what are your aspirations,

00:20:16.952 --> 00:20:19.028
what mistakes you are committing.

00:20:19.984 --> 00:20:21.984
It goes to a long extent

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.110
to forgive and forgive and forgive.

00:20:25.242 --> 00:20:28.971
Forgiveness is one of the qualities of the Spirit.

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.664
It forgives you

00:20:35.164 --> 00:20:38.225
and says it will work out.

00:20:38.725 --> 00:20:40.725
It will come around.

00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:43.225
But when you go too far,

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:46.134
say if you pay too much attention to your physical being

00:20:46.827 --> 00:20:48.827
or to your mental being,

00:20:50.713 --> 00:20:53.626
if you try to think too much,

00:20:54.968 --> 00:20:58.533
the Spirit indicates its displeasure

00:20:59.033 --> 00:21:01.033
and you get a heart attack.

00:21:03.884 --> 00:21:05.884
Heart attack comes to you

00:21:05.963 --> 00:21:07.963
through displeasure of the Spirit.

00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:11.987
If the Spirit is angry with you, you get a heart attack.

00:21:13.382 --> 00:21:16.202
That means you've neglected your Spirit,

00:21:17.088 --> 00:21:19.088
you've paid attention to things

00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:20.247
which are not important.

00:21:22.641 --> 00:21:25.466
You have looked after things which are not important.

00:21:25.668 --> 00:21:29.422
You have not worried about yourself, about the Spirit, about your seeking.

00:21:29.992 --> 00:21:33.325
Even if you're lost, say in any fanatic behavior

00:21:33.386 --> 00:21:35.790
of reading some books and things and

00:21:35.939 --> 00:21:38.733
taking out certain things and remembering them by heart and

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:42.315
having an argument and goes on later all that,

00:21:42.815 --> 00:21:44.815
in all genuineness and goodness

00:21:44.933 --> 00:21:48.620
but stupidity then also you can get heart attack.

00:21:51.229 --> 00:21:53.229
Heart is very important.

00:21:55.175 --> 00:21:57.358
It sometimes gives you

00:21:57.637 --> 00:22:01.570
first warning by giving you a partial paralysis

00:22:01.749 --> 00:22:05.015
because in the heart is sort of a,

00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:10.652
resentment is created by the Spirit which creates a clot,

00:22:10.851 --> 00:22:15.026
a clot, and that clot when goes into the brain

00:22:15.225 --> 00:22:18.381
you get a partial paralysis,

00:22:19.162 --> 00:22:21.162
so that you do not move any further.

00:22:22.505 --> 00:22:24.505
Your attention is taken to it.

00:22:24.724 --> 00:22:26.724
Then you start thinking of God,

00:22:26.782 --> 00:22:28.782
thinking of all the things

00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:31.282
and maybe

00:22:32.103 --> 00:22:35.148
then if you come to Sahaja yoga you get cured

00:22:35.648 --> 00:22:38.476
because again your Spirit forgives you.

00:22:41.105 --> 00:22:43.754
We are taking too much liberty with our Spirit.

00:22:46.784 --> 00:22:49.737
It is true God has given you freedom

00:22:50.839 --> 00:22:54.183
and He is not going to take away your freedom at any cost.

00:22:54.683 --> 00:22:57.307
You have to be absolutely free to choose

00:22:57.345 --> 00:22:59.734
whether to go to heaven or to go to hell.

00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:02.234
He is not going to force you.

00:23:02.734 --> 00:23:04.734
Only thing one can do

00:23:04.832 --> 00:23:07.923
is to explain to you and tell you

00:23:08.082 --> 00:23:10.566
that this is the way you go to hell.

00:23:10.885 --> 00:23:12.885
Even then if you want to go

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.059
then what can anybody do about it?

00:23:18.097 --> 00:23:21.642
Even God, He doesn't want to challenge your freedom at all.

00:23:22.142 --> 00:23:24.770
He doesn't want to make you, in any way

00:23:24.929 --> 00:23:26.929
bound to Him, like some people are,

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:28.947
bound just bound, without understanding.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.943
But He wants your complete liberation.

00:23:33.222 --> 00:23:36.729
So the first stage is that you have to choose your liberation

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.610
through your own freedom of choice.

00:23:41.014 --> 00:23:44.023
Now, up to this point, till you were human beings,

00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:47.226
there was no choice for you,

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.469
but after becoming a human being

00:23:50.668 --> 00:23:53.689
you were given the choice because you could develop well

00:23:54.732 --> 00:23:58.218
to understand what is right and wrong in your own freedom,

00:23:58.718 --> 00:24:02.392
so that you can enter into the Kingdom of God as

00:24:02.892 --> 00:24:04.122
people

00:24:04.963 --> 00:24:09.071
who are free and have chosen good in their own glory

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.250
and in their own freedom.

00:24:14.722 --> 00:24:17.109
This is the only small little step

00:24:18.693 --> 00:24:22.736
where we always confuse our freedom with our ego.

00:24:24.782 --> 00:24:27.704
For example, now,

00:24:28.806 --> 00:24:31.707
this hall is here say, for me to speak.

00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:37.765
Somebody comes from outside who has been sort of

00:24:38.265 --> 00:24:40.909
worked up in some sort of an organization and

00:24:40.927 --> 00:24:44.606
he thinks he is doing the greatest work in the whole world in such a myth.

00:24:45.387 --> 00:24:47.830
Comes down here in that ego state,

00:24:47.969 --> 00:24:49.969
sits down here and asks me

00:24:50.108 --> 00:24:53.800
questions after questions, questions after questions, questions after questions,

00:24:54.079 --> 00:24:56.604
doesn't allow anybody else to speak,

00:24:56.823 --> 00:24:59.104
takes away all my time to himself

00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:02.978
as if this hall is booked by him and all the audience is gathered by him.

00:25:04.562 --> 00:25:07.094
He is least bother as to see

00:25:07.393 --> 00:25:10.355
that this is an ego that is working.

00:25:12.582 --> 00:25:14.582
So we should not

00:25:14.741 --> 00:25:17.210
confuse our freedom with ego,

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.630
that's what I have to give you a counsel.

00:25:20.313 --> 00:25:26.388
Try to differentiate your ego from your freedom.

00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:30.575
When you are ego bound, you are a slave of your ego.

00:25:31.918 --> 00:25:33.736
When you are super ego bound,

00:25:33.794 --> 00:25:36.176
you are slave of your super ego,

00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:37.709
of your conditioning.

00:25:37.747 --> 00:25:39.747
For example, you are born a Christian, you are a Christian

00:25:39.825 --> 00:25:41.403
you are bound forever then.

00:25:42.706 --> 00:25:46.456
All right, you are a Christian but what about real Christianity within you.

00:25:46.477 --> 00:25:48.956
What about your rebirth in the real sense of the word.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.338
So you become enslaved to these things, so there is no freedom.

00:25:56.838 --> 00:25:58.838
And Spirit is

00:25:58.997 --> 00:26:01.721
the freedom, is the free.

00:26:02.221 --> 00:26:04.221
Being within us.

00:26:04.721 --> 00:26:06.721
It is detached.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:08.759
It cannot be killed.

00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:11.259
It cannot be blown away.

00:26:11.418 --> 00:26:13.478
It cannot be burnt away.

00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:18.044
It is eternal. Anand. It is eternal.

00:26:18.946 --> 00:26:23.342
That Spirit is joy.

00:26:24.344 --> 00:26:27.013
That Spirit is the source of joy.

00:26:28.838 --> 00:26:30.726
That emits joy.

00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:36.471
Joy is different from happiness and unhappiness.

00:26:37.112 --> 00:26:40.413
Ego, when it feels pampered, it feels happy.

00:26:40.612 --> 00:26:43.281
I like it, I like it.

00:26:43.781 --> 00:26:45.781
This "I" business

00:26:47.345 --> 00:26:49.767
is ego pampering

00:26:50.173 --> 00:26:53.614
that is no joy. Because you like to drink today

00:26:53.677 --> 00:26:56.672
and tomorrow you don't like to have a headache.

00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:00.496
It has the double side of I like and I don't like.

00:27:02.575 --> 00:27:08.900
You like something through your ego, dislike through your super ego.

00:27:09.666 --> 00:27:13.392
So it is a one coin

00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:17.084
and there are two faces, one is happiness and another is unhappiness.

00:27:17.193 --> 00:27:21.538
Joy is beyond that. Joy is a drama

00:27:22.038 --> 00:27:27.130
seer, is a witness. You see a drama. You know it's a drama going on.

00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:30.677
You just watch it as a drama. You're not involved

00:27:30.786 --> 00:27:32.786
and you are seeing it and enjoying it.

00:27:33.286 --> 00:27:34.977
You are crying if you see something, you're

00:27:35.022 --> 00:27:37.400
weeping but you know you are not that, it's a drama.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.900
Seer, the witness.

00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.202
Your Spirit is the witness

00:27:44.242 --> 00:27:46.242
and when you become the Spirit

00:27:46.742 --> 00:27:48.742
you become the witness.

00:27:49.908 --> 00:27:52.742
You become the witness. For example,

00:27:54.009 --> 00:27:57.139
you are seeing something through a window.

00:27:57.639 --> 00:28:00.231
There is something exists in the window for example.

00:28:01.728 --> 00:28:07.074
Now you enter inside the room and you see through the window.

00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:12.997
Your conditioning is like one way arising in you as a thought,

00:28:12.998 --> 00:28:14.629
which comes from the past.

00:28:14.707 --> 00:28:18.303
It rises again and another thought comes up and goes

00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:21.416
in the past.

00:28:21.475 --> 00:28:23.640
First the past thought is there and

00:28:23.659 --> 00:28:26.140
then another future thought is there it disappears.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.939
You see the thought rising but you can't see a disappearing of the thought.

00:28:30.439 --> 00:28:32.439
In between that is the present.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.113
That's the place is established, that present

00:28:36.345 --> 00:28:37.483
is established

00:28:37.657 --> 00:28:41.600
when your attention becomes enlightened by the Spirit.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.986
Either you think of the future or of the past.

00:28:45.831 --> 00:28:49.191
But I say now. At this moment, at the present.

00:28:51.224 --> 00:28:52.816
You cannot stand there

00:28:52.987 --> 00:28:55.316
because your Spirit is not enlightened.

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.334
Because Spirit is the present.

00:28:59.735 --> 00:29:03.093
When you get your Realization,

00:29:03.593 --> 00:29:06.993
you find that you are not thinking

00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:09.590
of the future or the past, you are just enjoying.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.090
Everything becomes different.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.328
The whole life becomes a drama

00:29:16.828 --> 00:29:18.828
and the joy out of it starts coming out

00:29:19.328 --> 00:29:22.234
and you really enjoy small, small things here and there

00:29:23.213 --> 00:29:25.612
and you really understand

00:29:25.904 --> 00:29:28.414
how much joy was lost before Realization.

00:29:29.477 --> 00:29:31.985
This is not a mental thing that gives you joy

00:29:32.923 --> 00:29:36.082
but the joy pours on you from your head just like this,

00:29:36.145 --> 00:29:38.236
cool thing starts pouring down.

00:29:39.274 --> 00:29:43.033
As some people have a feeling of a tension rising up,

00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:46.764
it's the same way, a cool sort of thing,

00:29:48.097 --> 00:29:53.149
flow of joy you feel in your whole body pours out.

00:29:53.649 --> 00:29:56.354
Sometimes this cool breeze that rises in the head

00:29:56.854 --> 00:30:01.212
also starts becoming like a fountain pouring down that joy within you.

00:30:01.458 --> 00:30:05.113
You look at the pictures, are examples see this star of Moses.

00:30:06.176 --> 00:30:08.176
You David star you see that

00:30:09.259 --> 00:30:12.164
when you see than you can think about it

00:30:12.664 --> 00:30:14.664
or else just watch this.

00:30:14.977 --> 00:30:16.977
Watch it and don't think.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.216
The joy of the creation of that thing, whole thing,

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:23.716
becomes one with you.

00:30:23.862 --> 00:30:29.472
Like all the creation around a lake

00:30:31.305 --> 00:30:35.102
is completely felt in the lake

00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:37.126
if the lake has no ripples.

00:30:37.334 --> 00:30:41.549
Completely. In the same way, all that is joy,

00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:45.355
the creator, whosoever it may be has put there.

00:30:45.855 --> 00:30:49.045
You get the complete joy within yourself because there is no thought.

00:30:50.316 --> 00:30:53.048
There is no barrier. No conditioning.

00:30:53.694 --> 00:30:55.694
The whole thing becomes one with you

00:30:56.194 --> 00:30:58.194
and you start feeling extremely happy.

00:30:59.152 --> 00:31:01.152
Extremely joyous.

00:31:03.214 --> 00:31:07.772
A feeling, which is indescribable.

00:31:08.001 --> 00:31:10.001
It is to be just enjoyed,

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:12.946
to be felt. Like Kabira was asked,

00:31:13.446 --> 00:31:16.931
"Why don't you speak now?" So he says in Hindi language,

00:31:16.952 --> 00:31:18.952
he is one of the terrific poets we have,

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:21.825
he says, "Jab mast huye to kya huye.

00:31:21.867 --> 00:31:30.919
When I have gone into the nectar of the intoxication

00:31:31.063 --> 00:31:33.773
of the Spirit, now what can I talk.

00:31:33.877 --> 00:31:37.361
There no word. No cup can fill this joy,

00:31:37.674 --> 00:31:40.057
no words can fill this meaning.

00:31:40.307 --> 00:31:43.582
You better be with me and get it and enjoy yourself."

00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:45.255
That's all he could say.

00:31:45.922 --> 00:31:47.922
That's what I say, the narrow vision

00:31:48.422 --> 00:31:51.649
has closed your eyes to so many things.

00:31:51.753 --> 00:31:53.753
Even Christ you cannot understand.

00:31:54.253 --> 00:31:57.790
About Christ it is written in Devi Mahatmya, about Maha Vishnu,

00:31:57.978 --> 00:32:02.070
all His life is written, if you can read it you can find out

00:32:02.133 --> 00:32:04.955
that before coming on this earth you will see

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.256
how He was created, what powers He was given,

00:32:08.527 --> 00:32:10.991
how He is the Son and all that is written.

00:32:11.074 --> 00:32:14.921
But for us, only you think that Bible is the authority.

00:32:16.463 --> 00:32:19.953
It is. But even to understand that Bible,

00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:23.138
as I told you, to understand Gita you better get your Realization.

00:32:23.867 --> 00:32:26.975
In the same way to understand that Bible also

00:32:28.829 --> 00:32:31.625
you have to get your Realization.

00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:37.063
The One about Whom

00:32:37.563 --> 00:32:40.540
it is described had never been to a school.

00:32:43.686 --> 00:32:45.686
None of them have been to any school.

00:32:46.186 --> 00:32:49.187
For the first time in this life I have learnt this English language.

00:32:49.375 --> 00:32:52.493
I never knew this language in any one of my lives before.

00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:55.514
Because I knew I have to talk to you.

00:32:56.347 --> 00:33:00.109
And I have to tell you about Spirit in this language.

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:07.703
But to understand it we have to read ancient scriptures.

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:09.986
Beautiful ancient scripture are there

00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:13.407
which describes the nature of the Spirit.

00:33:13.907 --> 00:33:19.660
It is said that Spirit has got three qualities. Satchitananda -

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.521
Sat, chit, Ananda. Sat means truth,

00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:26.021
chit means attention.

00:33:26.521 --> 00:33:28.086
Anand means joy.

00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:32.949
Sat is the truth. What is the truth now?

00:33:34.199 --> 00:33:37.805
If you see something white it is the truth, all right.

00:33:38.305 --> 00:33:40.305
But what is the truth of this shawl.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.430
A realized soul can know

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.233
not you because his Spirit is enlightened.

00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:50.755
He sees the fifth dimension of this shawl.

00:33:51.255 --> 00:33:55.084
Let him hold it in his hands and he will know that this is Mother's shawl.

00:33:55.876 --> 00:33:59.547
Immediately he'll feel those cool vibrations coming out of it.

00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:01.839
He'll know that this is Mother's shawl.

00:34:02.547 --> 00:34:03.743
That is the truth.

00:34:05.035 --> 00:34:07.354
The four dimensions, which we know of,

00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:13.726
is not the truth but the fifth one which is the truth, which is the Spirit.

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:18.080
Sitting down here you can find out anybody

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.261
what is he suffering from what are his problems,

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.449
what are his chakras, it is absolute.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.571
This knowledge is absolute.

00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:30.633
If you have five or ten children who are realized

00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:34.262
and if you tied her eyes

00:34:34.762 --> 00:34:37.216
and ask them about a patient,

00:34:37.258 --> 00:34:40.427
which is he suffering from, they will all raise their fingers

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.510
this or this or this

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.744
or all of them,

00:34:46.015 --> 00:34:47.271
whatever maybe the case.

00:34:47.306 --> 00:34:50.042
All of them will raise the same fingers

00:34:50.834 --> 00:34:52.834
it is absolute knowledge.

00:34:54.355 --> 00:34:56.355
It cannot be argued.

00:34:57.188 --> 00:34:59.188
It cannot be refuted.

00:34:59.688 --> 00:35:01.688
It is what it is.

00:35:02.188 --> 00:35:06.667
And also today the man may be having these

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.273
problems tomorrow he may not have at all.

00:35:10.377 --> 00:35:12.752
So then whatever was there is finished

00:35:12.835 --> 00:35:15.210
whatever is today that's what they are going to tell you,

00:35:16.793 --> 00:35:20.684
so this is the truth. The rest is all

00:35:22.872 --> 00:35:26.109
is mithya, is false.

00:35:27.755 --> 00:35:32.603
I was once going in Kashmir

00:35:33.811 --> 00:35:37.514
driving through some very remote corner

00:35:38.514 --> 00:35:42.064
and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations in the air

00:35:43.522 --> 00:35:44.875
and I asked the driver

00:35:44.896 --> 00:35:46.710
"Is there any temple here or something?"

00:35:46.773 --> 00:35:51.301
because in Kashmir there are many temples which are vibrating.

00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:55.350
So many things have come out of the Mother Earth,

00:35:55.413 --> 00:35:57.413
as it said in the Ten Commandment

00:35:57.913 --> 00:35:59.814
that "Thou shalt not worship

00:35:59.835 --> 00:36:02.502
anything that is created by the Mother Earth,

00:36:03.002 --> 00:36:07.472
reproduced and worshipped."

00:36:07.972 --> 00:36:10.740
There are many in Kashmir like that.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.659
So, I asked him and he said "No there is no temple,

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.680
there are no Hindus live in this area.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.577
I said but still I feel tremendous vibration

00:36:18.702 --> 00:36:21.546
so my husband told driver "All right, let's go the way she says."

00:36:21.963 --> 00:36:23.963
So, we followed about three miles

00:36:24.276 --> 00:36:27.037
and we reached a colony of people

00:36:27.183 --> 00:36:28.975
who were Muslims living there.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.626
When we asked, "Is there any temple here?",

00:36:32.126 --> 00:36:36.753
he said, "No, but there is one great mosque."

00:36:36.982 --> 00:36:39.979
"What mosque is that?" called as "Hazrat Iqbal."

00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:44.948
That means one hair of Hazrat Mohammad Sahib

00:36:46.094 --> 00:36:48.524
of Mohammad Sahib one hair was there.

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:54.017
And even now to take His name, the vibrations start flowing.

00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:56.121
How can I deny Him?

00:36:57.975 --> 00:36:59.414
He was the truth.

00:37:00.352 --> 00:37:04.094
Spirit will not deny. It is the falsehood that denies

00:37:04.136 --> 00:37:05.662
all these real people.

00:37:06.162 --> 00:37:08.786
It is the Spirit, that

00:37:08.892 --> 00:37:12.148
gives you the truth, which integrates all that is truth

00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:16.312
and throws away that is untruth.

00:37:17.375 --> 00:37:19.606
That's why you must get your Spirit.

00:37:20.294 --> 00:37:23.802
Before that anybody talks to you about God,

00:37:24.135 --> 00:37:27.065
about anything they can even crucify.

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:30.186
They are such stupid foolish people

00:37:30.874 --> 00:37:33.726
that they can do anything. They'll argue with you they'll

00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:36.951
fight with you, they'll do all kinds of stupid things but

00:37:37.826 --> 00:37:39.826
understand you.

00:37:40.326 --> 00:37:42.326
This is what my father told me

00:37:42.701 --> 00:37:45.601
that you have to find out an en masse method,

00:37:46.101 --> 00:37:49.312
method by which you give Realization to many people

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.274
so that they can see that there is something beyond.

00:37:53.774 --> 00:37:55.774
They are all standing on the first floor

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:58.274
if you are born on the tenth floor

00:37:58.774 --> 00:38:01.970
and you tell them something that you see on the tenth floor,

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.999
they're not going to believe you, they will fight with you, they'll

00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:07.041
quarrel with you, they'll pull you down

00:38:07.062 --> 00:38:09.062
because their ego is challenged all the time.

00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:12.416
So best thing is to transform them,

00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:15.249
give them en masse Realization.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.520
That is what is the Spirit is

00:38:18.812 --> 00:38:22.422
that every one of you have got Spirit

00:38:24.547 --> 00:38:29.296
but it was very difficult in those days to give en masse realization,

00:38:30.629 --> 00:38:32.629
the blossom time had not come.

00:38:33.129 --> 00:38:35.297
Today the blossoms time has come.

00:38:35.943 --> 00:38:39.029
And the wind that blows the cool wind

00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:42.075
gives Realization to so many of them.

00:38:42.575 --> 00:38:46.066
Thousands of people have got Realization,

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:49.269
you also many of you have got your Realization.

00:38:49.873 --> 00:38:52.589
So this Spirit is established, you feel

00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:54.632
you are something different now.

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.726
The transformation has started, the baptism has

00:38:57.747 --> 00:38:59.747
been done in the actual sense.

00:39:00.351 --> 00:39:03.725
and you start feeling its moving, you feel the cool breeze.

00:39:05.371 --> 00:39:09.692
Now, when you take to your collective being, you become

00:39:09.796 --> 00:39:11.796
one with the others also.

00:39:12.671 --> 00:39:14.144
You try to give.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.884
Now you are taking from me when I go, you stand here and give.

00:39:19.426 --> 00:39:23.265
When the light, the lamp is not enlightened,

00:39:23.765 --> 00:39:25.765
then all right try to enlighten it.

00:39:25.786 --> 00:39:28.965
After enlightenment what does the light do, is to give the light.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.236
Spirit gives you, your meaning.

00:39:35.278 --> 00:39:40.291
Spirit gives you your understanding

00:39:40.624 --> 00:39:45.063
of the truth that is reality not unreal things,

00:39:46.292 --> 00:39:49.845
me you cannot understand if you are not Realized you cannot

00:39:50.949 --> 00:39:54.373
I'm just like you, there is no difference.

00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:59.814
But those who are Realized know about me very well.

00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:02.125
Even living in Ramuln.

00:40:02.271 --> 00:40:05.818
A saint who met one of the Sahaja yoginis, she was American,

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.860
and he just bowed to her

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.022
and made her sit higher than him and said, you have met Mother.

00:40:13.168 --> 00:40:15.390
I have not yet met Her. And she was surprised

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.890
that how did you know all these things.

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.390
There are so many saints in India

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:23.971
who are real saints, who know about me.

00:40:24.471 --> 00:40:26.979
But those who are very close to me also,

00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:30.797
because you know my husband is highly placed in life

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.605
and we have friends of very elite and very...

00:40:33.814 --> 00:40:36.063
I have seen all prime ministers of the world,

00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:39.319
I've met them and I've met all sorts of kings and queens

00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:42.250
and this and that and every day I am shaking hands with them.

00:40:44.042 --> 00:40:47.942
They don't know me, they don't recognize me.

00:40:48.228 --> 00:40:50.325
There was a gentleman who we knew very well

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.869
he is now the President of the High Court,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.518
World High Court

00:40:59.397 --> 00:41:02.037
and, I mean, we knew him very well

00:41:02.036 --> 00:41:03.863
a great friend of my husband's and all that,

00:41:04.149 --> 00:41:07.158
and suddenly he saw, his wife saw my photograph with

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:08.933
one of the Maharajas

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:10.967
place one of the Maharajas having in his pocket.

00:41:12.185 --> 00:41:15.175
So the Maharaja suddenly took it out the photograph and put it

00:41:15.169 --> 00:41:17.675
to his eyes and put it back. So she said what is this?

00:41:17.961 --> 00:41:19.961
Such and such lady, I know her very well.

00:41:20.014 --> 00:41:22.014
He said yes, but don't you know she is

00:41:22.085 --> 00:41:24.514
the Mataji, who has cured me of my heart trouble.

00:41:25.131 --> 00:41:27.713
She said, really? I didn't know she was a Mataji or anything.

00:41:28.213 --> 00:41:30.213
She comes to the party, she's very quiet.

00:41:30.713 --> 00:41:32.230
She just sits quietly.

00:41:32.245 --> 00:41:34.245
I never even heard her speaking.

00:41:34.493 --> 00:41:37.620
For the last 25 years I know, she speaks very little.

00:41:38.003 --> 00:41:41.577
Oh God, she gives lectures and there are thousands of people.

00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:43.054
Can she speak?

00:41:43.399 --> 00:41:44.719
She was surprised.

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:47.664
We have never seen her speaking anything.

00:41:48.164 --> 00:41:50.624
I won't even be able to recognize her voice even

00:41:50.658 --> 00:41:54.056
my husband of course speaks a lot and her husband speaks

00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:57.005
a lot, I also speak but I have never heard her speaking anything,

00:41:57.058 --> 00:42:00.295
she just keeps quiet, sometimes amusing to herself.

00:42:00.743 --> 00:42:03.364
She seems to be a dignified lady but otherwise

00:42:03.398 --> 00:42:07.261
she never makes any efforts to impress us or anyway tell us that she is Mataji.

00:42:10.344 --> 00:42:15.163
Immediately the husband got such a shock

00:42:15.236 --> 00:42:17.138
and he immediately telephoned to my husband,

00:42:17.153 --> 00:42:19.814
I never knew she was Mataji. It was such a thing.

00:42:19.848 --> 00:42:22.481
You knew I am a seeker, I'm a seeker, a seeker.

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:25.719
And he said that. So my husband said she's now in Delhi, go and meet her.

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:28.219
Immediately he sent for me.

00:42:28.408 --> 00:42:31.615
and he got his realization in five minutes,

00:42:31.843 --> 00:42:34.526
but his wife didn't get it. So he sent her back.

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:38.939
He sent her by plane, that you better get it.

00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:40.621
This is the thing one has to get.

00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:44.441
Now the emphasis

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.329
that you have to be your Spirit

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.140
is very much reduced

00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:51.572
in the modern society.

00:42:55.509 --> 00:42:58.231
Emphasis should be that your Spirit

00:42:58.731 --> 00:43:00.731
is to be achieved in this life time.

00:43:01.949 --> 00:43:04.297
This is what one has to do, is the

00:43:04.564 --> 00:43:06.564
only thing one have to do,

00:43:07.064 --> 00:43:09.064
that is not there in the western societies.

00:43:09.972 --> 00:43:13.268
Secondly for this you have to control your attention,

00:43:13.263 --> 00:43:15.263
don't allow your attention to spill out.

00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:19.437
I hope I told you the story of

00:43:19.607 --> 00:43:22.535
Janaka did I tell them I do not know but I'll again repeat

00:43:23.773 --> 00:43:27.022
Like there was a Raja Janaka, the father of Sita

00:43:27.075 --> 00:43:29.075
father-in-law of Rama.

00:43:30.953 --> 00:43:32.526
And Narada went to him,

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.684
another celestial being, he went to see him and he said,

00:43:36.262 --> 00:43:39.035
"How is it, you are a king and you move about

00:43:39.112 --> 00:43:41.535
like a king, you have everything like a king,

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.550
you have gold and everything

00:43:43.603 --> 00:43:46.972
and how is it people say that you are [unclear]

00:43:47.064 --> 00:43:49.064
above all these things, above your body?

00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:50.243
How is it?"

00:43:51.131 --> 00:43:53.131
He said, "All right, I will tell you in the evening,

00:43:53.223 --> 00:43:54.570
but just now you do me a job.

00:43:54.701 --> 00:43:57.714
You carry some milk in this pot."

00:43:57.845 --> 00:43:59.390
The pot had no rim also.

00:43:59.754 --> 00:44:02.556
So poor fellow was carrying that.

00:44:03.755 --> 00:44:05.755
The whole day he was carrying got tired.

00:44:05.828 --> 00:44:08.314
He said don't allow even a drop to spill out.

00:44:08.367 --> 00:44:09.940
He was looking at it all the time.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.526
In the evening he got tired

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.970
and put it there and he said, "Now will you tell me,

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:15.983
I've had enough of this."

00:44:16.269 --> 00:44:18.269
He said, "What did you see when you were moving about?"

00:44:18.944 --> 00:44:21.572
He said, "Nothing, what could I see? I was just watching

00:44:22.868 --> 00:44:24.868
this milk that it should not spill out."

00:44:26.203 --> 00:44:28.203
He said, "In the same way

00:44:28.994 --> 00:44:32.637
I am at that stage where my attention does not spill out."

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.565
That is the state you are achieving

00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:37.188
your Self-Realization,

00:44:37.688 --> 00:44:41.759
where the attention is completely enlightened by your Spirit.

00:44:42.259 --> 00:44:44.969
It doesn't envelope anything like that

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.809
and even if it goes round it comes back as it is.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:52.262
My hand when it touches it, it doesn't become this metal, does it?

00:44:52.762 --> 00:44:54.762
It comes out.

00:44:55.578 --> 00:44:59.549
It's absolutely detached from this. I can touch it but I am not that.

00:45:00.312 --> 00:45:03.552
Just now I am matter. I am everything,

00:45:03.578 --> 00:45:06.056
I am worried about my children my house this thing,

00:45:06.214 --> 00:45:08.214
but when I become realized

00:45:08.714 --> 00:45:10.714
I get completely detached.

00:45:12.557 --> 00:45:14.557
I am a spiritual living being.

00:45:15.057 --> 00:45:18.623
Then nothing

00:45:19.782 --> 00:45:23.060
can keep you down, nothing can dominate you.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.901
And you do not dominate anything.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:33.402
That is the state of the Spirit. When that happens

00:45:35.535 --> 00:45:40.742
you become beyond dharma sustenance, you are beyond it.

00:45:43.376 --> 00:45:48.746
For example there is no temptation for such a person.

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:51.246
There's no temptation.

00:45:52.062 --> 00:45:54.062
There is no mental activity either

00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:00.580
there is no stealing nor telling lies. Such a person is extremely

00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:01.966
honest and fearless,

00:46:02.466 --> 00:46:05.039
like Christ. He had nothing to do with the prostitute.

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:08.521
I mean she was a different style, He was a different style.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.455
But when people started stoning the prostitute

00:46:11.504 --> 00:46:13.128
He stood up before them and asked,

00:46:13.234 --> 00:46:15.323
who are the ones who have not committed the sin?

00:46:15.375 --> 00:46:16.654
They could have stoned Him.

00:46:16.812 --> 00:46:19.730
This His honesty and His strength stopped it.

00:46:21.389 --> 00:46:24.142
They will stand by all those who are tortured

00:46:24.326 --> 00:46:27.552
and troubled by people who are oppressive.

00:46:27.947 --> 00:46:30.419
They are not afraid of anything. They are fearless people.

00:46:30.919 --> 00:46:33.953
Neither they frighten anyone. They are compassionate.

00:46:34.163 --> 00:46:36.163
But when it comes to protesting

00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:40.909
they stand up fearlessly against those

00:46:41.014 --> 00:46:44.409
who try to torture and ruin others.

00:46:45.699 --> 00:46:49.345
There is no oppression. Even

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.835
I cannot force you to get Realization.

00:46:53.967 --> 00:46:57.122
I cannot argue it out with you. It has to work out.

00:46:57.438 --> 00:46:59.438
It is as simple as that.

00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:03.424
If you do not want it, you can never get it.

00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:04.966
Out of question.

00:47:05.097 --> 00:47:08.454
So there is [unclear] as I say, if you do not want it, you better go away

00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:12.523
But still some obstinate people will sit there. No, I'll sit here. For what?

00:47:14.525 --> 00:47:17.901
Such people also give out very bad vibrations to others

00:47:18.401 --> 00:47:21.800
and they disturb others getting their Realization, it is satanic.

00:47:24.302 --> 00:47:26.941
Still I make them sit all right sit down.

00:47:28.495 --> 00:47:30.495
You cannot force it.

00:47:30.995 --> 00:47:32.995
It's a light within you a flicker.

00:47:34.172 --> 00:47:38.614
And the analogy could be, like the gas.

00:47:39.661 --> 00:47:44.393
That rises and touches the flicker and the whole gas gets enlightened.

00:47:46.351 --> 00:47:49.660
The flicker is awake all the time and watching.

00:47:51.566 --> 00:47:53.566
Then the whole thing becomes the truth.

00:47:55.498 --> 00:47:59.299
Truth is very different from what we know as truth.

00:48:01.335 --> 00:48:04.318
Is a new dimension, by which we know

00:48:04.558 --> 00:48:07.525
this is the truth and this is not the truth.

00:48:08.025 --> 00:48:11.135
You can ask any questions when you are

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.884
connected with your Spirit. Ask any question.

00:48:17.019 --> 00:48:18.544
Ask the question about me.

00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:21.409
Then ask the question about Christ,

00:48:21.909 --> 00:48:26.112
about Moses, about God. Ask any question.

00:48:27.211 --> 00:48:30.489
And when the answer is yes, you will get cool breeze coming into you.

00:48:30.989 --> 00:48:32.989
If you aks any negative questions,

00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:37.409
you lose your vibrations. Might get tingling, might get heat.

00:48:39.784 --> 00:48:43.389
Because now your computer is connected with

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.763
the absolute and the rapport has been established of the truth.

00:48:49.096 --> 00:48:51.619
This is a new awareness you get by which

00:48:53.395 --> 00:48:55.657
you become aware

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:01.713
of truth which is the vibratory awareness.

00:49:04.088 --> 00:49:06.428
Through vibrations a child also can know.

00:49:06.563 --> 00:49:08.563
There are many children who are born realized.

00:49:09.662 --> 00:49:11.662
And they know where is the Kundalini.

00:49:12.162 --> 00:49:15.384
They know. They will tell you where is the Kundalini.

00:49:15.884 --> 00:49:17.107
It's the truth.

00:49:17.737 --> 00:49:20.617
Because they know the truth. For that you don't need

00:49:20.622 --> 00:49:23.197
too much of mental development.

00:49:26.353 --> 00:49:28.353
They are very dignified.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.543
They understand it better than many elderly people and

00:49:33.626 --> 00:49:37.166
people who are placed very highly in life.

00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:38.939
Christ has already said

00:49:39.048 --> 00:49:43.224
that rich men are not going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.856
He has already said because they are running.

00:49:45.913 --> 00:49:48.682
But I would say even those who think they know a lot,

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:51.052
all knowing, they will not enter.

00:49:55.875 --> 00:49:57.875
Because they do not want to enter.

00:49:57.958 --> 00:50:01.499
They know everything. They do not want to enter inside.

00:50:02.442 --> 00:50:06.811
They want to carry their mind everywhere.

00:50:08.274 --> 00:50:10.981
They want to carry their car inside the hall.

00:50:12.106 --> 00:50:14.106
How they will enter inside?

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.633
They are not willing to keep their mind outside

00:50:19.133 --> 00:50:22.004
because they are always dependent on that mind

00:50:22.218 --> 00:50:24.218
which has given them nothing.

00:50:24.718 --> 00:50:31.565
But to achieve Spirit you have to come there ego-lessly, to receive.

00:50:32.065 --> 00:50:34.888
The light of your being

00:50:35.388 --> 00:50:39.177
is going to enlighten the whole thing. Your temple.

00:50:40.146 --> 00:50:42.146
And when this light comes in,

00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:45.688
when this line shines in you,

00:50:46.891 --> 00:50:51.598
then you can feel your collective consciousness, you can feel it,

00:50:51.655 --> 00:50:54.730
the cool breeze of the Spirit manifesting through you,

00:50:56.584 --> 00:51:00.825
is described in the Bible in very short but deep.

00:51:01.716 --> 00:51:05.765
But, Adi Shankaracharya has written such a big book,

00:51:06.035 --> 00:51:08.265
one is called as Saundarya Lahiri

00:51:08.296 --> 00:51:09.663
or Chaitanya Lahiri.

00:51:11.882 --> 00:51:16.798
It is not easy to talk about all these in such a short time.

00:51:19.694 --> 00:51:23.617
He wrote treaties of philosophy.

00:51:24.117 --> 00:51:26.117
Great personality he was

00:51:27.841 --> 00:51:31.092
called as Vivekachudamani. First of all he gave

00:51:31.201 --> 00:51:35.357
conscious the call. Where is your conscience? Vivekachudamani.

00:51:35.857 --> 00:51:39.637
Then he wrote many books and

00:51:39.772 --> 00:51:42.968
ultimately he wrote Saundarya Lahiri.

00:51:44.041 --> 00:51:47.192
In that he says it's only the description of the beauty

00:51:47.248 --> 00:51:49.248
of my Mother I can describe

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.587
and in all details he has described nothing but The Mother.

00:51:52.696 --> 00:51:55.431
Her fingers, Her hands, Her movements and

00:51:55.488 --> 00:51:58.717
everything and what he saw how the vibrations move in Her,

00:51:58.878 --> 00:52:01.937
every words that She speaks.

00:52:03.374 --> 00:52:06.673
You have to read that book to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:10.631
It's very clearly given all these things.

00:52:11.626 --> 00:52:15.205
As I told you the other day, William Blake also has written about Sahaja Yoga

00:52:15.262 --> 00:52:17.262
very clearly.

00:52:17.996 --> 00:52:20.472
But unless and until you have Realization

00:52:20.842 --> 00:52:25.661
you cannot know the truth. So He's the truth, "Sat".

00:52:26.161 --> 00:52:30.101
Then is "Chit" is attention, He's the attention.

00:52:30.184 --> 00:52:32.184
Your Spirit is the attention.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:34.970
Attention of God.

00:52:36.616 --> 00:52:39.407
God is attentive to you through your Spirit

00:52:39.595 --> 00:52:42.424
and when your attention is enlightened by Him

00:52:42.429 --> 00:52:44.615
that means you've come in the attention of God.

00:52:46.235 --> 00:52:50.186
You are looked after by God. All His powers flow into you.

00:52:51.103 --> 00:52:53.103
All His protection comes to you.

00:52:53.369 --> 00:52:56.221
You will be amazed there will here Sahaja yogis will tell you.

00:52:56.566 --> 00:52:58.721
How they avoided accidents,

00:52:59.221 --> 00:53:01.221
what happened after accidents

00:53:01.721 --> 00:53:04.596
and miraculously how people are saved.

00:53:05.955 --> 00:53:09.987
It is nothing new to me. It is the minimum that can happen to a person.

00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:14.049
This is the minimum of minimum,

00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:17.542
because all the angels they take charge.

00:53:17.651 --> 00:53:21.757
You are on the stage, the angels are there to look after you.

00:53:22.127 --> 00:53:26.316
And you really start gradually feeling the presence of that blessing

00:53:26.816 --> 00:53:28.816
which is the attention of God.

00:53:29.316 --> 00:53:33.047
So He's the "Chit". " Sat", "Chit" and "Anand" He is the joy.

00:53:33.547 --> 00:53:35.547
He is the joy.

00:53:39.172 --> 00:53:41.172
Because God is joy.

00:53:42.193 --> 00:53:44.193
He created this universe

00:53:44.693 --> 00:53:47.525
not to make us serious and unhappy and sulky.

00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:52.189
See how many flowers, how many beautiful things,

00:53:52.194 --> 00:53:55.523
how many colors what He has created for us.

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:59.899
For us to enjoy He has created all this not to indulge into nonsense,

00:54:00.399 --> 00:54:02.399
into filth, into dirt,

00:54:06.102 --> 00:54:08.102
the dirt of the mind, the sin

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:11.045
the filthy ideas.

00:54:15.243 --> 00:54:17.243
But to have a clean heart

00:54:17.951 --> 00:54:21.238
and to have a clean morality within us.

00:54:24.863 --> 00:54:28.361
He has created this beautiful world for us to enjoy

00:54:28.392 --> 00:54:31.495
without that you cannot enjoy, you cannot enjoy

00:54:32.281 --> 00:54:35.258
unless and until you have a clean morality within you,

00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:37.341
you cannot enjoy yourself.

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:41.950
And that joy is your own

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.450
once you get your Realization.

00:54:46.278 --> 00:54:50.092
This joy is the compassion and grace of God.

00:54:50.436 --> 00:54:52.436
When the Kundalini first rises

00:54:53.379 --> 00:54:55.379
through one small little thread,

00:54:55.879 --> 00:54:57.879
She touches the Brahmarandra here,

00:54:59.134 --> 00:55:01.134
just one thread.

00:55:01.217 --> 00:55:03.882
She opens and the grace and joy.

00:55:04.382 --> 00:55:06.382
Because here is the seat

00:55:06.882 --> 00:55:11.110
of Sadashiva, here is the seat of your Spirit.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:16.289
When it touches the Spirit, that seat, the flow

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.956
of the grace starts coming

00:55:18.196 --> 00:55:20.934
on your sympathetic nervous system and you feel relaxed.

00:55:20.991 --> 00:55:22.991
First thing happens to you you feel relaxed.

00:55:23.231 --> 00:55:26.502
Is the grace. Only one thread has reached

00:55:28.018 --> 00:55:32.612
and then the flow that is flowing today this one is the Brahma

00:55:34.674 --> 00:55:38.300
is the power of God flowing through you.

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:43.138
This is what you have to get.

00:55:44.185 --> 00:55:48.101
This is what you've to remember, somebody touched Christ and the power went.

00:55:51.179 --> 00:55:53.179
For us

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:59.019
it is necessary to know that we are the first Australians to get Realization.

00:56:00.121 --> 00:56:02.274
You are the first people to get it.

00:56:03.139 --> 00:56:05.997
And it's a great responsibility on you,

00:56:06.132 --> 00:56:10.053
all of you who have got Realization today and before,

00:56:11.074 --> 00:56:12.628
to keep it strong.

00:56:12.711 --> 00:56:16.099
Make it into a tree, because you are responsible for

00:56:16.156 --> 00:56:19.142
all the progeny that is going to come to this

00:56:19.173 --> 00:56:22.475
beautiful land of yours by which you are blessed.

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.481
So this is the beautiful place

00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:31.913
and beautiful people. So many children of mine.

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:34.197
Today is the last day.

00:56:36.572 --> 00:56:41.592
It's a very sad thing that one has to say good-bye.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:46.400
I hope you all will make it convenient to come and see me on Sunday.

00:56:46.692 --> 00:56:48.692
I'll be looking forward to you.

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:51.463
Here I will try to cure you also

00:56:51.546 --> 00:56:54.858
if you have any problems, but don't bring all the hospitals there.

00:56:57.233 --> 00:57:01.413
I will teach you how to cure and how to give realization.

00:57:01.913 --> 00:57:05.182
Best thing is you bring the case to me and I will tell you how to

00:57:05.265 --> 00:57:08.539
cure yourself because if you are realized souls, you can cure also.

00:57:09.247 --> 00:57:11.247
We always in India do,

00:57:11.304 --> 00:57:13.304
when a cancer patient comes in, we call

00:57:13.335 --> 00:57:17.626
one of his relations, give him Realization, teach him how to cure cancer

00:57:17.709 --> 00:57:19.709
and he looks after the patient.

00:57:20.209 --> 00:57:23.552
Because that's the best way one can do it.

00:57:23.557 --> 00:57:25.634
He can give Realization,

00:57:25.665 --> 00:57:28.195
to that person he can look after better,

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:29.835
he knows the person better

00:57:29.996 --> 00:57:33.025
and it works out much better that way.

00:57:34.228 --> 00:57:37.157
So I hope you'll make it convenient to come and see me.

00:57:37.266 --> 00:57:40.857
I must say, I was very much impressed by Sydney people

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:46.212
who have been so kind to come here and listen and get their Realization.

00:57:46.842 --> 00:57:48.842
I have to say that

00:57:49.342 --> 00:57:51.342
because I am a mother.

00:57:52.102 --> 00:57:54.622
I cannot just leave it to your senses.

00:57:55.122 --> 00:57:57.695
I have to ask, I have to request you.

00:57:58.586 --> 00:58:02.093
I have to be very, very patient with you, extremely patient

00:58:02.723 --> 00:58:05.595
and loving so that you listen to me

00:58:05.835 --> 00:58:08.527
and take your Realization. I have to actually

00:58:08.584 --> 00:58:10.584
go to you to do that.

00:58:10.615 --> 00:58:13.900
It's all right, that is mother's job, only mother can do it.

00:58:13.983 --> 00:58:15.983
When Christ will come, He will take His

00:58:17.238 --> 00:58:19.660
eleven powers and He will just sort you out.

00:58:19.821 --> 00:58:24.276
Before that please have yourself completely judged

00:58:24.359 --> 00:58:27.577
through your own Kundalini awakening and work it out.

00:58:28.441 --> 00:58:31.301
Those people who have came with ideas

00:58:31.358 --> 00:58:32.498
of their own should

00:58:32.529 --> 00:58:36.187
just go and see for themselves what they have achieved by these

00:58:37.338 --> 00:58:38.540
ideas.

00:58:38.571 --> 00:58:41.985
There have been so many organizations, one after another.

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:45.273
There is no way to organize God.

00:58:45.487 --> 00:58:47.487
Better organize yourself

00:58:47.622 --> 00:58:50.356
through your Spirit, which is the absolute.

00:58:52.054 --> 00:58:54.093
May God Bless You.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:32.100
Please put your hands towards Me
and close your eyes.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.580
Those who are still struggling
with your questions,

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:41.940
I’ll tell you that I went to Melbourne
and not a single question was asked,

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.820
and all of them got realization.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.300
I’ve seen those who ask questions
never get Realization

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:54.180
and they disturb others also
who start thinking on their lines

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.340
and get ruined.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.540
It’s very sinful to do that to others.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:07.300
So please try to get your Realization
and understand.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.700
Questioning has never helped you.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:14.820
Please keep your questions to yourself.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.420
Ask them to Me some other time.

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:20.580
Just now, get your Realization.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:28.420
Some people who have been to gurus and all
that will feel tremendous heat in the body.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:33.940
Possibly, they may feel some sort of
a pressure on their necks.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:40.020
If they have been taken to mantras
or wrong things, they might feel it.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:44.580
Everybody is welcome in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:50.260
Whatever wrong has to be brought outside.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.460
That is very important.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:02:00.500
For Me it is important that you get
your pure Spirit.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:05.540
Please close your eyes,
just close your eyes

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.300
and do not analyze anything.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.700
Even if you have problems with your
vibrations, do not worry about it.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.740
If it gets too much heat
then you can just throw it away,

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.967
twice, thrice
as if you are throwing away water.

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:17.467
It will work out.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.460
Those who came for the first time
may not feel cool breeze,

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.940
they should definitely come also on Sunday..

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:35.220
All are welcome.
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:49.780
The first center is the center of Christ.

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.220
You have to forgive. Go on forgiving.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:03:00.820
Say, I forgive, I forgive, I forgive.

01:03:07.382 --> 01:03:14.100
Specially those who have been professing,
unauthorized about Christ

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.420
without Realization,
damage this center very badly.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.780
So you have to ask for forgiveness
from Christ for that.

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:30.420
Or from any other, like Moses or Krishna
or anyone whom you have been worshipping

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.940
without any authority.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.420
Without any Realization
you have no authority.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.260
Misidentifications can be corrected.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.860
For example power’s the same.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:10.100
Supposing you are a Muslim,
you can ask the question,

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.740
Mother are you Mohammad?

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.500
Just ask it.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.300
You are a Christian,
you can ask a question,

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.540
Mother are you Jesus?

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.740
Just ask the question.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.140
Because power is the same.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:26.260
I am here at the integrating point.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.700
So just ask the question.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.220
It will work it out.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.300
Ask thrice from your heart.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:37.460
Just ask the question. From your heart.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:42.420
Not just for making fun,
from your heart, just ask the question.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:47.220
If you are a real seeker
and a true person and honest to yourself,

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:51.860
you will ask a question from your heart.

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.940
But if you are frivolous and you have
come here just to be a frivolous person

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.020
then nothing is going to happen.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.660
Just ask a question like that.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.700
Any question of that kind
you can ask Me.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:36.100
Put your hand on your heart.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.500
Left hand towards Me.
Right hand on your heart.

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.420
Now ask for forgiveness.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:58.660
If you have done anything wrong
in your seeking without your knowledge

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:04.340
or with your knowledge you have to ask
for forgiveness from God Almighty.

01:06:04.514 --> 01:06:08.420
Because He’s the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:15.220
He’s the ocean of Grace,
ocean of compassion.

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:22.420
You have to ask for His forgiveness
and do not build any guilt with it.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.940
That is very important.

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:26.980
Once you have asked for forgiveness,
you are forgiven.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:31.300
As I have already told you
that Christ has suffered for you

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:37.060
and He has taken responsibility
of absolving your sins.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:42.340
Once your Kundalini passes through
that center, your sins are absorbed.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:49.380
So do not form any guilt
after saying that, please forgive me.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:54.740
You need not say precisely for everyone
but in general that please forgive me

01:06:54.740 --> 01:07:05.940
if I have done anything wrong against you
in my ignorance or in my knowledge.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.580
In all humility you have to ask
for forgiveness.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:14.740
Ask for it thrice. That’s all.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:25.380
You cleanse your heart of all burdens,
of so called repentance and mistakes

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:32.340
that you have committed.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.914
Say it thrice.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:06.660
Now ask a question,
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:13.700
Please ask the question,
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.510
Ask twelve times.

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.460
It is a very subtle happening.

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:42.420
So you may start feeling the cool breeze
on your fingers.

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:48.660
It is very subtle, while you are on a gross level
suddenly you become that subtle being.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:52.962
Just ask the question.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.140
You become that subtle being.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.980
Like an egg becomes a chick.

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.140
There’s nothing of the egg remains.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:11.300
Same way you become the subtle being.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.500
You become subtler.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:22.262
Ask the question. Am I the spirit.
Mother, am I the spirit?

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.940
Now ask for your Realization.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:54.980
Mother please give me my Realization
and sustain my Realization,

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:59.663
let me grow in my Spirit.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.100
Do not feel guilty.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.820
Just say I am not guilty.

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.260
Ask for realization.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.660
Mother give us our Realization.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.940
In a very simple way.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.060
Do not feel guilty about anything.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.580
Not at all.

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:16.020
That’s your right to have
your Realization.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.340
You have to desire.

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:42.340
Your desire is weaker
than your action.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.500
You have to desire from your heart.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.500
Your left side is weaker.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.980
Put both hands towards Me now
let’s see.

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:53.620
You are getting more vibrations
on your right hand, less on the left.

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.780
You may raise your left hand like this
if it is less.

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:05.060
You can raise your left hand like this.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:15.620
Do it seven times with the right hand.

01:16:22.884 --> 01:16:25.617
Just see how he is doing that.

01:16:30.104 --> 01:16:32.381
On top of your head.

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.180
Good better.

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:37.860
Now raise the Kundalini.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.500
Now see yourself how to raise
the Kundalini.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:45.060
You can see on the [unclear]
and you’ll see how to raise the Kundalini.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.820
Now you tie it up.

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.073
You will feel it.

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:53.700
It is rising again.

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.540
No the other way around.

01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.220
It moves like that.

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.794
Do it thrice.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:16.100
Now you’ll feel it better.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.900
You feel very relaxed.

01:17:28.232 --> 01:17:30.940
That’s what it is. But you must learn how to manage it.

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.780
Its all right, balanced now.

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.140
Both the sides.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:41.700
Mostly you feel the left side,
in any society which is western, is weak.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.500
Because of the desire is less.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.740
As I told you the desire
to achieve the Spirit is less.

01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:55.060
We don’t want action than the desire
so you have to raise the left side

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:59.333
and put it to the right.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:17.780
You’ll find the Cool Breeze on your head.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.980
It’s there.

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.020
Now you can take it down also like this.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:32.740
Good idea.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:39.140
Put down your pressures on the Mother Earth.

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:46.420
Raising and push it down. Again.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.860
Do it seven times.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.460
You will feel much better.

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:56.020
Because now your hands are now emitting
the Cool Breeze.

01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.100
Do it with respect to yourself.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.954
See now, if you have done seven times.

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.980
Feel very relaxed.

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.340
No thought in your mind.

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:25.060
I hope you will all make it convenient
to come on Sunday

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.900
and whatever I will tell you,
whatever needs to be done.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.020
Thank you very much all of you.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:31.940
May God bless you all.
