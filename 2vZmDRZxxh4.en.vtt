00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.840
Today we have decided to have a Hamsa Puja in Germany.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.940
We have never yet

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.720
paid much attention to this center of Hamsa,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.400
which is, I think, very important for the Western world,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.880
rather than for the Indian or the Eastern.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.280
The reason is, at the Hamsa chakra,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.860
part of the Ida and Pingala

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.840
come out and manifest.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.160
Means, the expression

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.260
of Ida and Pingala is given through the Hamsa chakra.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.420
So this Hamsa chakra is the one

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.060
that, as if has not gone

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.840
up to the Agya,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.880
but is holding on certain threads

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.580
or certain parts of the Ida and Pingala.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.460
And they start flowing through your nose,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.300
expressing through your eyes, from your mouth

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.580
and from your forehead.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.160
So you know that Vishuddhi chakra

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.940
has got sixteen petals,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.540
which look after the eyes,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.540
nose, throat, tongue, teeth.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.000
But the expression part

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.620
comes through the Hamsa chakra, of all
these. So

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.020
it's a very, very important thing

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.740
in a Western mind

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.480
to understand Hamsa chakra.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.680
There's a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit:

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.240
"Hansa kshveta ha, baka ha kshveta
ha.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.720
Ko bhedo hansa bakayo ho.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.880
Neera-ksheera vivek e tu.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.340
Hansa ha hansaksh, baka ha baka
ha."

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.940
Meaning: "The crane and the swan, both are white.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.960
And what makes the difference between the two?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.020
If you mix the water and the milk together,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.540
the hansa [swan, ed.] will just suck in the milk.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.840
So it can discriminate between the water and the milk.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.840
While the bakha, means the crane, cannot."

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.300
The very significant thing for Sahaja yogis to understand.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.660
Discretion is to be understood

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.680
very deeply within ourselves.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.060
And how we develop discretion

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.900
is very important in Sahaja yoga.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.720
But before we go to that, let us see,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.500
how this discretion plays a part, very much,

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.580
in the manifestation of our expressions out.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.480
We are the people, in the West, who always try

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.060
to express ourselves outside.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.760
It's very important how you look.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.640
It's very important where you look.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.600
What you look, what you see.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.240
It's very important that

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.760
your appearance should be good.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.080
Very particular, they spend lots of time in improving

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.980
their appearances. This is the minimum.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.180
Then they have a method by which we call "the medias".

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.060
The country speaks or manifests through the medias.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.680
And the medias have to have a training.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.880
Every country has it's specialty,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.880
one better than the other. And when you see all of them,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.040
you find that they lack discretion completely.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.600
Also in our speech,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.140
in our expression of literature,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.320
expression of poetry,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.520
expression of our relationships with others,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.180
any kind of expression requires discretion,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.720
which is a deep-seated knowledge or wisdom.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.940
If in the West people were not so much outside,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.260
they would have been much better off, I think.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.840
If, supposing, in England,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.960
people don't become punks,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.380
then others will laugh at them. And they'll think

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.620
that, "This man has no money to become a punk."

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.700
So kind of a fashion that sets in,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.280
in a society of that kind, which has no discretion

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.800
and which is very outward.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.260
Fashions won't work out in countries, where they are

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.040
deeply rooted into traditions

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.460
and into proper understanding of life.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.680
Of course, the countries which have been very ancient,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.840
have been traditionally trying to improve themselves

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.960
with "error and trial" and "error and trial" methods,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.080
have developed much better discretion.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.780
Much better understanding. But the countries which are

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.780
not gone through all that ordeal, have not worked out,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.620
have not gone through that discipline, lack in discretion.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.800
And that's why many of the people,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.380
though they are of very deep seeking,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.560
have gone astray.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.820
If they had discretion, they would not have gone astray,

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.980
they would not have gone to wrong places, but the discretion

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.080
was missing.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.120
So it comes to the discretion, how to use

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.620
your Ida nadi and Pingala nadi.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.120
And discretion to understand what is good and what is bad.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.400
Now let us see the Ida nadi.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.340
Ida nadi is very important,

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.360
because the discretion in this can only come

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.100
through traditional understanding.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.280
Ida Nadi starts from the Ganesha's point, Mooladhara.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.660
So first we miss the biggest support,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.700
the biggest help, the biggest nourishment

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.800
of holiness and auspiciousness at Mooladhara,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.740
if we have no discretion.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.720
We always take to thing, which is detrimental to our growth,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.560
and also which may destroy us,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.360
not only us but the whole country.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.480
We like people who are destructive,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.480
when there is no discretion. Discretion means

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.780
that you must choose the things which are good for you,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.700
which are benevolent to you, which are good for the collective,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.620
which are good for your ascent.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.400
On the contrary, the people who have no discretion

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.940
fall into the traps of wrong type of people, like Freud.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.380
I mean to an Indian, Freud... nobody can believe that

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.180
you can go into such a nonsensical idea.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.220
But people accepted Freud

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.820
more than they could accept Christ.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.620
Because the discretion was completely missing.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.560
If they had that traditional discretion in them,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.120
they would have been saved. This [type?] traditional discretion

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.420
is the thing that comes through Ida nadi.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.160
Now, that's what they people call it, as "conditioning".

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.620
And they say that, "Conditioning is very bad. And people

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.720
should not take to conditioning. And one should be free

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.620
from conditioning." Which is absolutely
a wrong idea.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.960
In that also, there has to be discretion.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.520
What conditioning is good and what is not good

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.760
has to be taken.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.000
Now, because there is no discretion about conditioning also,

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.280
outright discarding all traditions, all that is

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.300
coming to us through our experiences of our forefathers,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.100
everything is discarded. The history is discarded.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.060
And we say, "Oh, no, we are beyond it. We feel free."

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.520
Like I was surprised, yesterday in the plane
somebody told me,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.460
"I feel very free when I have no clothes upon myself."

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.440
I mean, if the clothes can imprison you,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.580
then what happens to the real prisons, what will they

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.700
be for you?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.880
But that sort of a funny idea

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.240
comes into the head of people and they think that,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.460
"We can justify all this stupidity that we follow,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.200
because we lack discretion."

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.400
Intelligence cannot give you discretion.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.400
It cannot give you discretion as far as

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.120
the conditioning is concerned.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.320
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.540
how you develop your discretion.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.740
Yesterday only, I gave a very beautiful talk

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.140
to the ladies of Paris or, I should say, ladies of France,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.920
regarding the discretion of women.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.640
The discretion of the Ida nadi is intuition.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.760
If you develop that discretion within you

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.500
through your meditative powers,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.500
you develop intuition.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.880
And intuition is nothing but is the help of the Ganas,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.440
which are surrounding you.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.840
If you learn to take help from the Ganas,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.660
you can become very intuitive and

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:14.040
without much intelligence of yours, you can say the right thing.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.820
The whole of Sahaja yoga, I would say,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.220
fifty percent at least out of that, is based on intuition.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.900
For that, you have to develop a proper sense of Shri Ganesh.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.460
Shri Ganesh in it's right sense you have to understand.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.040
From there it starts, because he is Ganapati. He is the one,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.900
who is the master, is the chief of all the Ganas.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.540
So the Ganas give you the intuition.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.720
For example,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.040
say, I have to go somewhere.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.960
And then I..., what I say is

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.120
that, "No, I won't be able to go there tomorrow."

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.300
And I won't go, somehow. And people think,

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.440
"Mother, how do You know?" I know,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.500
because the Ganas are there, and what they say is the truth.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.080
They know all about it.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:23.740
Or anything I say about someone comes true.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.320
So they start asking me, "How is it Mother,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.760
You have come to know about it?" I live
on intuition.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.580
Like I have to catch a plane, I know by intuition what's going

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.980
to happen. This part has to develop by worshiping Shri Ganesh.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.400
So imagine, Shri Ganesha also rules

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.800
a part of the Hamsa chakra.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.600
So when we say Ham and Sa, these two are

00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:00.080
actually the bija mantras of the Agya.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.920
But when the Agya touches the Hamsa, it starts here.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.620
That's why at the base, at the root of it, is the Hamsa.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.280
And here the Ham, Ham means
"I am".

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.080
If you are discrete, you will not take to fashions.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.740
You'll not take to stupid ideas. You have your own personality.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.040
You are a Sahaja yogi. You don't listen to people,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.240
who are non-Sahaja yogis.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.320
That is the Ham part:

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.080
"I am". Not the ego part.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.780
But the Ham - to understand that, "I'm a Yogi

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.000
and I know so many things, which normally people don't know,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.060
and so I have nothing to do with them.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.740
I've not to take any lessons from them.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.820
They are not to teach me anything.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.900
There's nothing that they know, I know much more."

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.860
To be aware of your Self is Ham.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.300
So that comes from the right side, I would say.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.200
The discretion of right side is Ham

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.160
and the discretion of left side is Sa.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:24.380
Sa means "You", means:

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.480
"You are The One."

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.920
In your case you know, who is the "You".

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.380
But for every human being "You" is the Divine.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.160
"You are The One." This comes

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.640
from the left side - is Sa.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.360
So the word "Hamsa" is made of two types of discretion,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.840
where to see "I am" and where to see "You are".

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.720
On these two balances - as they have shown here beautifully -

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.700
the Moon and the Sun.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.940
In the center is the cross,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.020
which gives you the balance, which gives you the dharma.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.220
How all these things are connected, one after another,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.340
layers after layers; you can see how

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.160
dharma is connected with discretion.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.960
Now there are people who are

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.200
suddenly enticed by some sort of a ritual.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.480
For example I've seen some Sahaja yogis,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.980
they come to the Puja and they are giving bandhan to them, like mad.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.760
On the way, they'll go, they'll give bandhan. Anywhere they go,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.160
they'll give bandhan, like mad.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.700
That's just conditioning. That's not discretion,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.700
that's not Sahaja yoga.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.340
It is to be seen - "Is it to be given bandhan or not?"

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.700
In the presence of Mother there is bandhan,

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.100
what is there to give bandhan to yourself?

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.120
The people, when I'm talking, are giving
bandhan,

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:12.840
raising their Kundalini. They're all mad people, I think.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.220
In the same way, there are people;

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.360
Yesterday I heard there's one kind of a music record,

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.440
is played everywhere in the ashrams,

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.340
because they can all jump like on a camel.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.520
It's a music for the camels, you see.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.660
Now, this record everybody appreciates. Why?

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.960
Because they can jump like a camel.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.460
Once you start jumping like a camel, human beings can't give up.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.080
They form habits. So they like that particular music.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.220
They'll go on jumping like a camel, because now they have become

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.280
camels, they have to behave like camels. Now if there's something,

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.540
some music, which is like a horse,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.120
like the trot maybe, maybe gallop, anything.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.280
Now, once they listen to it, suddenly they start following that

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.320
rhythm. Now they become the horse, which is galloping.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.240
Now the horse is galloping, they become

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.560
horses and they only like that galloping music.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:22.040
So on and so forth. Could be a donkey, could be anything.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.220
We are not animals, we are human beings and we are.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.480
Hum - "We are".

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.860
We are Sahaja yogis, we are not dominated by any

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.040
particular type of

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:45.800
rhythm or particular type of music.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.200
Every variety we can appreciate and understand,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.840
as long as it is dharmic.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.990
As long as it is balancing.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.460
As long as it is auspicious and holy.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:05.760
So you can see on the Hamsa how many things are judged.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.480
I think, the whole of Sahaja yoga stands

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.600
on the balance of Hamsa.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.000
There are people who are very

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.280
astute, means very honest.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.980
But this honesty can go into a ridiculous limit.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.580
Or else , there are people,

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.180
who are very hard working.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.560
This can also go to the ridiculous limit.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.980
So these qualities, which are supposed to be good,

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.160
cannot be righteous.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.960
The righteousness is discretion.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.780
Glorified.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.880
If you have discretion,

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.000
then you glorify

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.220
that discretion into righteousness.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.140
Like, we can say now, Christ. We can take Christ.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:29.740
Christ was such a discretion.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.480
When Mary Magdalene was stoned,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.800
He had nothing to do with prostitutes, I mean,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.120
it's nothing to do at all, no relationship.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.480
But He could see in discretion that these people had no business

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.040
to stone her. He stood up there,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.480
in His own courage, and he said that,

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.320
"Those who are not committed any sin can

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.260
throw the stone at [My/Me?]."

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.380
This is the power of His discretion,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.620
that people just felt that discretion within themselves.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.380
And they felt that, "In discretion

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.680
this man is a holy man

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.460
and we cannot throw stones at Him".

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.600
If you are discrete as Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.940
you will make others discrete also.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.660
Others will have to be discrete and to understand.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.120
And this "Neera-Ksheera Vivek" is the differentiation

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.780
between the water [neera, ed.] and the milk [ksheera, ed.].

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.240
The bad and the good can come to you if you develop

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.400
that discretion part.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.540
In Sahaja yoga, at every stage, you'll find people falter,

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.960
also with the right side indiscretion.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.040
And the right side indiscretion comes from the ego

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.660
manifestation of people.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.080
This ego is, as I said, is Ham.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.800
This ego doesn't work, when it has to work.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.120
For example, I find some people

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.800
went for a marriage in the church.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.860
Of course, that's wrong for Sahaja yogis. We don't believe in any

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.900
human religions, you know that. All right,

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.640
you went to the church, is all right.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.900
But they sent a lady to London

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.440
to buy "Laura Ashley" dresses.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.840
To buy. And I think, also, maybe, some men must be

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.220
wearing tailcoats to do the wedding.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.100
Where is that ego lost?

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.260
That ego that "you are the Sahaja yogi" was completely lost.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.340
I think, they all went for hairdressing,

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.340
all kinds of things they did, and they all wanted to go there

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.880
as old Christians,

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.480
walking to the church next to the graves

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.700
of stupid bishops.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:24.140
It's not only here, India is much worse.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.320
As far as religion is concerned, the left side,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.380
they are very, very conditioned people, and there they

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.640
fail to understand, what is discretion.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.560
For example, we had Gyanadeva. He was such a great

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.060
incarnation and He didn't even have shoes on His Feet!

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.960
And these days, they are taking out a big procession of palanquin,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.700
so-called shoes in it - of Shri Gyanadeva -

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.580
and thousands and thousands of people singing praise.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.620
Just imagine.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.260
Who can tell them that, "Gyanadeva had no shoes!

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.800
What shoes are you carrying in the palanquin?"

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.300
And whatever village they go, or whatever city they go,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.260
they are fed with sumptuous food;

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.400
everybody falls at their feet, "The saints have come

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.080
with a palanquin - " ...and the shoes never belonged

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.380
to Gyanadeva in it! So this madness goes on.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.560
Now, you see all these things happening around you,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.720
in every country, in every religion, in every

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.220
stupid area you see all this happening.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.560
But you just join hands!

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.020
You become one with it!

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.480
And then it becomes so difficult

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.300
to understand, what has happened to you.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.080
Now, this Ego, when used properly,

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.540
then it's discretion.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.140
Now also people have another very horrid, horrid conditioning,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.920
apart on the religion - is of the countries:

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.460
"I belong to India", "I belong to Germany",

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.640
"I belong to England." Everything is wretched.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.940
I mean, to say something like that means

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.940
you are not yet grown up to the Sahasrara land.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.520
Those who start becoming

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.740
some nationality

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.880
do not know that your nationality is transformed.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.580
Actually don't need any passports.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.300
In the area where the Divine reigns,

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.020
no passport is needed. It's written large on your faces.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.680
But still inside this deep conditioning is there

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.880
that, "I belong to this country, my country is
very great,

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.940
your country is not good."

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.260
But when it comes to discretion is to think

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.260
that, "All right, I was born in Germany

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.300
and Germany has made lots of mistakes.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.300
Let me work it out, so that I get back all my German people

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.600
into the area where resides peace, joy and happiness."

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:39.740
There is, this conditioning is used in discretion.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.840
In everything you will find there are two sides.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.400
Which way you move is your discretion.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.680
For example, there are people who have a conditioning

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.540
of a particular, say, a religion.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.800
Supposing they belong to the Jew religion,

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.100
and have come to Sahaja yoga. Or they belong to Christianity

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.600
and have come to Sahaja yoga.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.180
So now, what is the discretion?

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.480
As soon as another Jew person comes, or a Christian person

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.540
comes in, they'll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.260
And they all become great friends. Because "She's Jew, I'm Jew,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.660
my father is Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing...

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.080
Same with Christians, same with other communities,

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.020
same with any other nationality.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.240
Now, what is the discretion, when you see?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.780
The best thing, discretion at that point, is to see,

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.280
what are the faults of these so-called "human religions",

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.560
which are formed after the death of

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.060
the promoters, or we can say the incarnations,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.940
or the prophets who started them. This is first discretion.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.780
The second discretion is to read

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.760
those scriptures and find out, what is so special

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.100
that these incarnations have said. For I would say,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.760
if there is a Muslim, he should go to Koran and see,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.560
what's written in Koran as far as Sahaja yoga is concerned.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.580
If it's a Christian, let him go to the Bible and find out

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.860
whatever is written there as far as

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.940
Sahaja yoga is concerned, because Sahaja yoga is the Truth.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.640
And what Truth is written has to be found.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.320
If such a thing is developed, then you can go

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.800
further, if you are brave enough,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.040
and can be courageous, to go and tell the people

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.160
that, "See, what is this nonsense you are following?

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.120
It's not written, it's not done.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.380
Whatever is written, this is the essence of the whole thing."

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.640
That's the third stage, where you have to use your discretion

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.640
as far as a particular religion, nationality is concerned.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.020
Now when I am, say, in the

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.240
West, I have to discuss the West.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.280
When I am in India, you must hear Me!

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.240
You don't understand the language - this is good for you.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.400
You would lose all respect for Indians.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.900
I give them left and right!

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.620
And tell them what's wrong with them. But here

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.840
it is important that much is wrong

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.460
with us in the West.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.220
So the discretion is to see, what's gone wrong with us.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.280
Where are we wrong. Have you got any courage or not.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.360
For example, ladies don't have courage to wear a sari outside.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.280
Why? Sometimes - doesn't matter.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.780
When Indians can wear your dresses, you can wear saris also.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.160
Or a man won't wear Indian dresses outside.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.380
Is a little Hum is needed.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.720
They enjoy it, but they won't wear.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:30.060
They'll wear the same funny holey pants.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.660
They can wear the punky stuff, but they can't wear

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:41.000
something that is sensible, is good to wear.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.840
It's something that must give you the

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.620
idea that we are different people.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.660
Now, this red mark is very important, because

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.600
then you don't catch any bhoots. And has to be worn.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:03.040
In the Bible is written that, "There will be a mark on their heads."

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.100
But because there are so many other stupid people like Hare Rama

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.440
Hare Krishna - I don't think they wear any marks -

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.120
we are frightened of the society how to wear a mark.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:18.240
But supposing they say that, "You go about with a dishevelled hair",

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.720
we'll do it. Because that's allowed in the society.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.260
We are the people, we are not to be afraid of any society.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.520
We have to come out of it, and we have to teach them.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.820
Whatever is good we are going to do, whether you like it or not.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.540
That's the sign of a saint. If you have seen any saint,

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.140
anywhere, they've gone all out

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.500
to say whatever is right and whatever is to be done

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.780
and whatever is to be followed. That's the sign of a saint.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.080
Otherwise, if a saint sometimes gets dissolved

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.960
in the society, sometimes in Sahaja yoga, sometimes here,

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.540
then what's the use of such saints? Tell me any saint,

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.680
whom you know, who has not fought the society.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.860
Who has not pointed out the mistakes of the society,

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:11.280
in a very loud manner, without any fear.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.240
Have you known any saint like that? For Sahaja yogis

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.960
it is very important to have that courage within themselves.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.620
If you develop your discretion, then it works out.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.480
On the ego side, what kind of

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.740
a discretion you develop and how.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.140
On the right side are all the Devas, all the deities

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.120
sitting around you.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.280
You have to understand these deities.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.040
You have to know what They are going to do. Supposing, now

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.560
you are lost on the way.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.440
So, you should not think like all other people,

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.540
"Oh, I'm lost in the way, how will I go there,

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.540
what will I do?" After all, you are going for some nonsensical work.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.660
Doesn't matter. You must think,

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.920
"Why? Hanumana, He must have brought me here for some purpose,

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.520
let's be on the lookout." Accept it.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.280
Accept the situation.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.960
When you accept the situation, you are playing into the hands of the

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.440
deities and they are guiding you. Your deities are working it out.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.620
Accept it.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.440
And this acceptance will give you

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.200
a wonderful discretion over to your ego.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:43.620
Whatever goes wrong - "It's all right, we accept it."

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.360
And above all - the vibrations part,

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.000
which you have to see. If you do something,

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.160
if vibrations are going down,

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.200
then of course, "I am a Sahaja yogi.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.480
To me vibrations and my ascent

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.240
is the most important thing."

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.480
So to develop the discretion on the right hand side,

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.460
you have to know your goal, your destination.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.200
You must know on what path you are standing and where

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.260
you are brought, where are you today.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.780
You are not like other people.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.140
If that kind of a discretion you develop

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:33.320
within yourself, through pure intelligence.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.500
For that you need pure intelligence.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.060
And pure intelligence in a hamsa [swan, ed.] is that

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:46.320
it glides on the water.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.520
It shrugs [off] the water.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.720
It doesn't allow anything to overpower it.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.380
It's in the water, beautifully beautifying the lakes,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.580
also not allowing the lake to

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:10.980
dissolve them, or to overpower them, or to cover them.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.800
This is the part where they are Ham.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.100
If they want, they can dive down. If they don't want,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.500
they will not. They're gliding on the ocean.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.340
Ocean of the Samsara, of this Bhavasagara.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.440
And they are not going to be drowned into it. That is the

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.560
Ham part of it, which you should have, the discretion.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.480
On the one side, you should accept

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.440
things, when they come to you.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.440
The best among these was Shri Krishna,

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.500
I would say, who had real discretion.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:53.320
But, after all, He was Shri Krishna.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:58.100
But His methods were so interesting of discretion,

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.800
that it's enjoyable to know about

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.420
how He destroyed so many rakshasas.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.040
Every time He did not use His Sudarshan chakra,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.360
He used his discretion. Like there was a rakshasa,

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:20.500
who was trying to overpower the Pandavas,

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.900
who was trying to overpower the people, who were good.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.760
Shri Krishna

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.360
said, "Now, what to do with this horrible fellow?"

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.860
And this fellow had

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.380
boons from Brahmadeva and from Mahadeva and everyone.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.560
So Shri Krishna is the center, after all,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.180
so He wanted to organize

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.420
a proper destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.460
So what he did, that

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.700
there was a great right-sided saint

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.420
meditating, and he had taken a boon

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.540
that, "Nobody should disturb me.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.020
At least the one who disturbs me for the first time,

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.980
I should have power to destroy, if I look at that person."

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:25.300
And this one was meditating in a cave.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:30.140
Shri Krishna very beautifully ran away

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.320
from the battlefield. His name is Ranchordas.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.720
It's little... little bit derogatory [PEOPLE?] to say to somebody

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.920
that, "The one, who ran out of the battlefield."

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.960
So Shri Krishna ran out of the battlefield.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.260
But there was no other way out to kill this horrible fellow.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.320
And he went, and he was covering Himself with a shawl.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.360
He went into that cave and

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.000
covered that saint with His shawl.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.340
After Shri Krishna was running [away from] this horrible

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.240
rakshasa to kill him,

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.920
Shri Krishna went and hid Himself.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.400
When this rakshasa came near the cave,

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.480
he saw the shawl covering this saint.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.680
He said, "Oh, so now you are tired and sleeping here,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.800
running away from the field! Get up now!"

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.460
As soon as he said this, this saint got up and looked at him.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.020
And he was completely burnt away.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.200
So, if Shri Krishna is the Virata at His Feet;

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:56.140
or if Shri Krishna is Vitthala on His head,

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:01.580
in between the two resides Hamsa chakra.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.360
The discretion is very beautifully described

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.300
in the life of Shri Krishna.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.160
We can call Him that he had a naughty way of

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.520
using his discretion.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.520
He has done so many things like that.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.160
But they create a drama. They create His Leela.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.320
Because He was Leela. That's why he could

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.120
use His discretion to create a drama or a play.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.620
So on one side we have the help of Shri Krishna

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.320
to give us the discretion, and on the other side we have Christ.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.480
In between is placed this Hamsa.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.440
So we have two great incarnations within us,

00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:00.720
who are the embodiment of discretion.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.800
So one side is Shri Krishna,

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.080
who is the one,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.920
who looks after the conditioning side of it.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.940
And on the other side is Christ, who starts

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.100
looking after the ego side of it.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.900
The One who says on the cross, "Oh, God, forgive them,

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.420
because they do not know. Oh, Father, forgive them,

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.820
for they do not know, what they are doing." Is the same One,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.980
who takes a hunter in his hand and hits people, starts beating them,

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.720
because they are making money in the name of God.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.720
See the discretion. That's Jesus.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.240
Same Shri Krishna, who with his Sudarshan chakra

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:52.500
can kill thousands and thousands of rakshasas,

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.440
becomes the driver of Arjuna.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:02.400
The contrast of Their behavior

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.120
is the beautiful saga of Their discretion.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.460
Now, for a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.680
that they have to work out their discretion

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.820
in a manner that they develop their intuition.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.240
I would say the first thought could be the intuition,

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.840
could be the intuition. "Could be that this is intuition."

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:34.200
Try, experiment.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.960
But going to the extremes of everything is wrong in Sahaja yoga,

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.740
you have to do everything in moderation.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.880
Like, I told them to see everything through vibrations.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:54.400
So they will put their hands, I don't know, to everything.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.520
"Should I buy this sari or not?"

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.920
Even go beyond that: "Should I buy this

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.100
face powder or not?"

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.740
It's so ridiculous.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.840
Is so bad, that ultimately you find you have become a bhoot

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.000
and you are telling everybody that your vibrations are bad.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.460
Because your vibrations are bad.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.940
Your attention is bad. Putting your attention

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.340
to nonsensical thing

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.980
makes your vibrations absolutely disappear.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.560
So, with discretion

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.280
you must have common sense.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.980
Practical sense.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.560
I've seen people suddenly talking to anybody

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.840
about Sahaja yoga. No, it's not practical.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.360
Sahaja yoga is a precious diamond, you cannot give it

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.540
to every person. I've seen people at the airport

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.020
raising Kundalini of everyone. No, it's not meant.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.980
They have to come to Sahaja yoga. They have to ask for it,

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.740
they have to beg for it, then only they can get their Realization.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:27.240
We don't want quantity, we want quality.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.740
All My lectures, if you see in that, I've been insisting

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.600
on the quality of Sahaja yogis

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.820
and the quality of the seekers.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.680
But when we start thinking of getting a majority

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.000
for a vote for Shri Mataji -

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.680
I have to say I'm not standing for any election.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.500
Whether you elect me or not, I'm elected.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:09.620
You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.720
And when you fail in discretion, you find

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.340
some problems develop.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.720
Now, it is for you to find out, what indiscrete things

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.220
you have done, where have you gone wrong,

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.220
in which way have you done a mistake.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.180
It is for you to find out, then rectify it.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.240
Otherwise in Sahaja yoga there should be no problems,

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.280
there should be no ordeals,

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.620
there should be all joy and joy and joy.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.840
But the discretion should be to find out,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.600
what are your weaknesses,

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.940
where have you done wrong, what's gone wrong,

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.720
where, in what part and how we have failed.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.200
Sometimes people think, "Oh, we did a lot at that time,

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:11.420
now we can't do it." Then you have failed.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.620
Like I heard that people are saying, "Now we have come here,

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.680
so we'll not go to Guru Puja." It's wrong.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:22.180
Very wrong. You have to come to Guru Puja, no question.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.980
Guru Puja is the one puja you cannot miss.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.900
Even if you miss Sahasrara is alright, but Guru Puja is

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.140
very important.

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:42.220
At any cost you have to come for Guru Puja.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.680
I know I chose a place which is Andorra,

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.940
but it's not Himalayas!

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:57.980
Now the Sahaja yoga is so comfortable that we want

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.440
that there should be no change of flights.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.840
Directly we'll sit on a hansa (swan, ed.) and we can [DO RIGHT?].

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.120
You will, you'll see that. But if you

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.840
develop a habit of thinking, "Oh, it would be difficult..."

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.040
then it will be.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.780
But as Mother has said it, "It is going to be the easiest,

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.880
everything is going to work out."

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.240
Once you think like that, it will work out.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.720
Everything will work out, but first there shoul'd be

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.220
pure desire to do it.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.600
Whenever such ideas come into your head, again,

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.820
use your discretion.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:49.420
We go to Guru Puja for our own health.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.680
Every Guru Puja, if you remember,

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.340
you have come up very much higher.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.460
Every Guru Puja has helped you.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.860
Of course you say that, "Maharastra tour, that's very good."

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.740
I agree, it is - Maharastra tour helps you a lot.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.420
But that's for thirty days, so intensive.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.500
Guru Puja is only one day.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.280
How many pujas you have in Maharashtra? At least eight to nine,

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.780
sometimes even ten. That's why.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:29.600
Naturally it has to be much more effective.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:34.000
But Guru Puja itself is extremely effective.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.240
Indians have been asking Me, "Mother, once, at least once more,

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.860
give us the Guru Puja.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.340
We'll do anything to have Guru Puja,

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.780
please come." This time they wanted to have Guru Puja. Imagine!

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.260
You could not have attended Guru Puja in India.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:56.420
But Andorra, I have a special purpose.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.500
I have a special purpose. So please understand.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.620
I am not a purposeless personality.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.920
Gradually you'll learn how I fulfill the purpose.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:19.620
Yours, Mine and that of Sahaja yoga.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:24.520
Together. How I work it out beautifully

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:29.260
you will understand, and

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.240
I hope one day you also develop all those beautiful

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.220
ways and methods of discretion, by which

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:40.560
you just do the right thing and never the wrong thing!

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.980
Now, for the treatment of Hamsa chakra, which is

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:52.080
more on the physical side - it's outside, that's why it has to be

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.300
much more on the physical side also.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.040
So either we have used the ghee, and all that you know very well,

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.460
to put the Hamsa chakra alright.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:08.280
Also, for Hamsa chakra it's important

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.740
not to kiss people.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.120
I think kissing must be given up.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.260
Because with kissing you do allow

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.280
the germs of another person. In Sahaja yoga it's alright.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.520
But once I say that, that doesn't mean you go all crazy

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.640
with the kissing. No, not proper. If in India you go and kiss

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:33.380
somebody, he'll just be stunned. He'll not know, what is happening.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.000
The more you start expressing your love by all these gestures,

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.220
the less it is inside.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.840
The more you give expression, now for example,

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:52.560
there's a method of expressing "thank you."

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.260
And you go on saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.200
It's just a lip-service.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:03.120
But many people in many countries don't say "thank you" at all.

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.660
But they are very grateful, inside.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.600
The gratefulness inside creates the depth that is necessary.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:17.300
So to do it superficially, anything, too much,

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.840
has to be avoided in your discretion.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:30.180
But avoiding extremes,

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.600
avoiding too much outward expression,

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.640
again, can create another indiscretion like the English,

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:45.260
they don't speak, they just don't speak.

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.860
You travel with them every day for twenty-five miles,

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.320
sitting together; they will not say who you are.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.720
They'll know each and everything about you,

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.140
but they'll just keep quiet.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.060
They are not supposed to speak

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.880
- it's artificial. So the second point

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.600
we have to come to - we are not to be artificial.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:15.200
It's alright, if somebody feels like, just out of just spontaneity

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:20.120
wants to love me, and hug me, I don't mind.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.260
Because it's not artificial, it just comes. Children are most

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.820
spontaneous, they not artificial.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.800
They are not at all artificial. In the same way we have to be

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.280
very natural about everything. It's alright,

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:39.060
while talking to each other, if the men hit the men a little bit,

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.940
doesn't matter. They have not insulted, it's a love,

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.940
expression of love, is alright. But should be spontaneous,

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:49.860
should not be artificial. We should not take to artificiality

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.140
in Sahaja yoga. At all, by any chance.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.940
But wearing clothes is not artificiality.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.420
To be decent is not artificiality.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:05.220
To be dignified is not artificiality.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.020
Artificiality is that what you don't feel inside,

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.140
is to say out.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.380
That is artificiality and for Sahaja yogi, he feels

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.620
he has that bashfulness, he has that shyness,

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.580
he has that protocol and he respects his body.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.700
Out of respect of the body he doesn't want to do something

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.900
that will insult his body.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.680
And that's how if you understand how far to go

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.000
and how far to stop.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.900
Then there is another way

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.580
of indiscretion in Sahaja yoga, which I have seen. Is that

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.720
people start using Me in many purposes, like that.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:57.780
Like supposing, now, somebody's writing a poem.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.960
So he'll come to Me, he'll say, "Please correct my poem."

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:05.100
I'll correct one poem, two poems, three poems, ten poems.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.520
Then he will lose the capacity to produce poems.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.460
You should not use Me

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:17.340
for your own purpose in that manner.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.860
But in any case you are using Me.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:24.960
But with the understanding that, "Mother is all the time with me

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.440
and is helping me," there's no need

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.140
to come forward and jump on My time and to take My time

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.540
and to bother Me so that I should feel, "O God,

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.620
when will I get rid of this?" Or others have a thing, "Mother,

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.800
You must come to my house, You must take my child,

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.560
You must meet my husband, he might be a drunkard."

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.820
So taking attention to what you call "yours"

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.020
is also indiscretion.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:59.280
Instead of that, you put your attention to Me.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.820
Instead of taking My attention to you.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.120
It's a very delicate line,

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:09.740
as if we are walking on a sword.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:14.060
It's a very, very delicate line of discretion.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:18.100
But once you know

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.680
as a state within yourself, you are discrete.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.420
You cannot be indiscrete even if you want to be.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.480
And that is what is the ascent part. So once

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.640
you come out of this chakra

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.420
and pass through your Agya, you enter into Sahasrara,

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.060
where you have to be discrete.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.000
Whatever then comes out from there - blessed,

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:50.600
whatever expression comes out, blessed, from the Sahasrara,

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.780
is all discrete and beautiful.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:59.660
Some people have a habit of dominating Me also.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.500
Like I'm talking, they'll talk in between.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.460
I am saying something, they will come forward.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:11.360
Then I play tricks. I'm good at playing tricks.

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.560
But I'm very discrete, it's alright. My discretion

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.220
plays the tricks. Because if I am direct, you won't like it.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:24.060
So better be discrete and play tricks.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.740
In everything that we do, discretion expresses itself.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.760
And if you are a solid Sahaja yogi or a Sahaja yogini,

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.240
your discretion is evident and

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:40.400
everybody sees it and knows it, that it is there.

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:45.180
So for all of you it is important to develop your discretion today,

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:51.480
and to ask me to reside in your Hamsa chakra,

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.400
so that you are all the time stationed

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.360
in the power of discretion.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:02.160
With discretion we have evolved to human state.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:07.500
And to go further, we have to develop our innate discretion,

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:11.760
which I think is the essence of all the religions,

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.680
of all the adventures we have had,

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.020
of all the lives which we have known,

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.880
is the discretion around which everything moves.

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.480
May God bless you.
