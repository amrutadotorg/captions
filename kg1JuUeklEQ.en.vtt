00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.380
yes

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:37.329
What did he say mother could you please

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.370
say something about the collective and

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.089
the need for real-life selves to be

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.580
together but alright that's a very nice

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:51.309
addition I would like to say something

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.489
about connecting so far as you know in

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.839
the history of spirituality people have

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:05.920
gotten realization many people one after

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:08.800
another many people got it but I will

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.610
say one in a million one in a ten

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:18.520
million like because we have to have

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.250
some of the food to talk about beginning

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.940
we are missing what was written in the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.789
past but they those people who got

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.119
realization single-handed suffered a lot

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:35.500
and they could not transmit what it was

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:40.900
needed to be given to others in a way

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.920
that would be accepted now as you see

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.430
any discovery is made like that people

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.520
can benefit individually every person

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.960
can say oh I have parted so I can have

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.460
it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.400
ha but it is of a movin it is of Norman

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.670
I can take it I will say a personality

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.220
like Christ we once we had Christianity

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.350
what have they done about it I mean it's

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.840
a Saturday I mean to think such a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.850
personality too common what a great job

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.569
he has done to establish himself for our

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.140
detriment

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:20.220
what people have done the reason was he

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.140
wasn't he was alone it was not a mass

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.520
thing that was not the time because he

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.769
had to establish this Center without

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.650
that it could not be mass all right

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.870
it could not be a Hamas realization but

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.850
he talked about you have to be born

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.510
again and all that but the whole thing

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.290
fizzled out because they could not get

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.660
to the essence of it one person of that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:48.560
value coming on this earth found it

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:51.870
impossible to convince people in fact so

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.579
one has to understand that any anything

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.160
that is if evolutionary first-first

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:03.480
happens to one or two persons only but

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.760
then it happens to many me now in sahaja

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.739
yoga this another problem apart from

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.810
that that it is happening to many people

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.000
is them no doubt thousands are getting

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.000
realization is no doubt is working out

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.680
that you know that now the evolution has

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.900
come to the stage as I say it's the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.799
Blossom time many flowers are there and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.930
they have to become fruits but now why

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.130
necessary to have connectivity when

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.780
people are between or as a shield

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.570
that is a very important point one has

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.670
to understand the thing is that now when

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.400
you are getting realized what is

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.670
happening to you you are getting related

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.150
to the whole a my proposal is getting

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.200
related to the mattress say your body is

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.450
there and you are sleeping first you get

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.230
a little a vaguely you open your fingers

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.730
alright then you open your another thing

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.950
now there is a little trouble on your

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.960
finger and you can't see anything so you

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.020
open your eyes and you pay your

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.300
attention to your hands so that trouble

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.640
may be all right but you need another

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.310
hand to help so you want the another

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.549
hand also to be awakened to that point

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.580
like that so when the search opens are

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.770
getting awakened more and more see the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.440
problems that are facing us we can sort

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.690
them better because so many people are

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.630
working out the problem you understand

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.270
my point now together when we are

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:42.630
together we understand now this problem

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:42.630
I moved to America I had one in 1970

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:51.520
1973 for starting yes 1973 Allegra's I

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.830
was alone I mean I gave very good

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.280
lectures we had very big halls filled up

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.380
and everything is enough the reason is

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.900
the people who got realization didn't

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.060
have anybody to look after them there

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.480
was nobody to support them give them

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.920
assistance so they got lost I mean they

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.590
are there some of them are here and

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.040
there now now what has happened now

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.770
today when I am going to America

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.140
everybody is playing in Australia

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.080
they're playing in India they're playing

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.050
like the tension and we surprised some

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.970
people are coming from India to go down

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.310
Dominika some are coming from Australia

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.409
to go down to America some are coming

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.509
from France some from Switzerland they

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:37.319
are all rushing to America now the job

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.690
is in America all right so like the

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.849
attention see as soon as somebody pricks

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.970
me of my hand goes there my articles

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:48.479
that everything works so the collective

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.060
working out effort is going to solve the

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.770
problem but supposing if this finger is

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.460
fighting with this finger can I write

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:00.030
anything or if they are secluded and

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:05.460
alone then I can I use them all this

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:08.009
body has to become absolutely in Concord

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.889
with each other but so many are still

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:15.629
sleeping those who are awakened at least

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:18.599
must stick to it otherwise sahaja yoga

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:21.360
cannot go today I find it much easier to

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.219
give realization much as I was

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.490
struggling with six people for four

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:29.969
years in your London four years

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.370
seek speed but once they got realization

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:35.550
it started working fast and the more

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.529
people we get because the channel that

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.289
is to be used

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:42.539
it's like nerves in the body you become

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.719
a nerve of that body which is awakened

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.330
and once the nerves start working out

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.190
together realizing that there's one

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.310
force that is flowing through them all

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:58.319
of you have to work it out together with

00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:01.139
understanding of the divine it works

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:03.419
first any person who's all nerves are at

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.759
work will be much more dynamic than a

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:10.800
person who is half dead or is full

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:13.409
length so you can understand how

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.270
collectivities important then another

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:21.930
thing is that going to a very enjoyable

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:24.979
part that when the colour sahaja Yogi's

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.170
are collectively there they really know

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:32.290
because for the first time I'm starting

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.240
first before this you never enjoyed you

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.030
enjoy flowers enjoyed everything else

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.340
but not you wanted pure enjoyment of

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.950
human being starts coming when you

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.890
become truly realized I'll give you an

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:51.160
example we went to Calcutta one day and

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:53.320
I was in a room in a in one hotel and

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.380
there were three for sahaja Yogi's in

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.140
another hotel another one and one

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.570
gentleman came to me for his daily

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.670
language and whenever I raised him

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:09.250
Kundalini you see they've all got

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:10.870
vibrated and they all rushed to my to

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.780
know what has happened suddenly how is

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.640
it we got some joy within ourselves they

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.980
came to see and this man was there it

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.490
was a great room but they felt the

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.530
vibration is tremendous so it is not the

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.050
happening of an individual which is the

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.520
happening of the world and the

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.170
individual effort is going to be

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.320
absolutely useless it will be all

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.780
neutralized if you sit at home do your

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.770
meditation it won't work you won't have

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:43.110
any fun because the whole has to come I

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:48.250
give an example that when you churn the

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:50.770
butter in India I don't know you don't

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:54.820
do that way we do it very naturally you

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:58.150
put a little butter inside that and then

00:08:54.820 --> 00:09:00.610
again you structure so the butter starts

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:03.040
gathering around that butter all of it

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.590
comes together but some particles have

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.900
left they stick to the sides stick to

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:11.590
that there are no more as butter they

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:14.800
are thrown away as but it is as simple

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:18.490
as that you see the more you gather

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.470
together really enjoy the spirit of

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:27.730
friendship

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:31.270
spirit of mirth spirit of love and pure

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:34.750
form so far the loves buyers they say

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:37.540
it's last there's money there space

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.910
that's the relationship this is you a

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.070
British so I must love you I'm Indian so

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.440
I must love you all these nonsensical

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.420
barriers are there you love a human

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:51.339
being because he's a human being and

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:54.790
he's a yogi speaks the same now today I

00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:56.709
have attended a wedding party and the

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.450
bride and the bridegroom said we are

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:00.390
coming to Paris with you mother there

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.730
are hundred people coming to Madison

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.589
because I haven't changed pets but I

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.240
said you are asymptomatic I better enjoy

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:10.870
your money who said what are we going to

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.520
enjoy a line just to get our humans even

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.089
if I tell you don't come they won't

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.430
listen

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:17.410
they will enjoy their honeymoon there I

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.209
never said you come on the contrary I've

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.920
seen you go where you might be to enjoy

00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:23.140
your honeymoon where every left they

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.000
won't know because they know we're in

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:29.050
German hands with their brothers is

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.459
famous ancestors it's absolutely so I

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:37.149
think that the enjoyment of human beings

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:39.760
has not been there now there are people

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:43.209
who live in India who live in Australia

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.680
who live here all over the places but

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:47.260
when the sahaja Yogi's go to you I

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:51.459
should see them in the way they are

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:53.800
sahaja Yogi's in the villages way to

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:56.170
impress them way to feel the oneness

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.490
never there felt like this for a white

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.560
scheming they saw might scream they

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:02.290
would just run away and hide themselves

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.970
under this thing I see and even now

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.740
people are sometimes writing to see a

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.300
white skin in a village they say Oh God

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.089
they have come just to destroy something

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:12.459
but now that's all one now it's a human

00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:15.370
a human being is coming that all of this

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:18.120
for there is nothing like a black or a

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:22.529
white or anything left now it's such an

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:25.990
such a love that promise and understand

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:28.270
that's only possible if you learn how to

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:32.290
live collectively and collectivities

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:35.740
also teaches you where you are very

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:38.590
important a person was not live collect

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.390
cannot understand and seen people for

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.840
their own families even their families

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:48.220
their surgeries but once they come to

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:51.120
the ashram they know what yet because of

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:55.570
their chests you have to learn to adjust

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:57.670
you can't have private bathroom to

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.800
yourself and private room to yourself

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.750
alright you can have if you want to have

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.940
but you should also know how to exist as

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:07.270
you know I live very comfortably myself

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.520
but if it comes to live anywhere I have

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.520
no problem of comfort already in the

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.800
same way we are not barred from a job

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.170
because of all these things away we can

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.630
your bathrooms with us we do not enjoy

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.940
life so you want to have everything

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.400
absolutely first class that has lead

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.620
said that even when we go to the picnic

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.840
we take on the Metropolitan with us in

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.300
the same way we cannot enjoy life you

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.840
cannot enjoy nature we can enjoy

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:37.870
anything as long as we become a just an

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:41.380
individual oh I am the one who is well

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:43.930
to it the last of all we must know by

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.970
individualism will become malignant I

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.940
don't say become communist because

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.950
that's another monuments but by becoming

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.770
individuals will be combining them what

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.090
is malignancy that an individual self

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.850
takes up upon itself

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.770
I will grow I will put it doesn't know

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.720
how to grow with the whole it has no

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:06.190
coordination with the whole that's why

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:08.740
you say it is a cancer cancer is nothing

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:11.440
but is a malignant cell which is alone

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:16.240
and he's saying that I have to achieve I

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:19.810
can unit I can manage it and once it

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:23.350
starts going like that whosoever touches

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.960
that person becomes all these ideas we

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:28.710
are higher race or we have greater

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.100
people we are moneyed people we are

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.649
something

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:37.480
special we are of this club all these

00:13:32.649 --> 00:13:40.089
disappears it's all nonsensical they are

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.130
identified with nonsensical things I am

00:13:40.089 --> 00:13:46.300
making ourselves miserable another salsa

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:49.240
mr. eyed well you give up on that

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:52.000
suddenly you find Oh what did you you

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:55.720
don't want in it we just want to be in

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.240
the company of sahaja Yogi's I have seen

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:02.740
people ambassadors very highly placed

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:05.259
people just getting me lost when they

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.139
search the other day I had a businessman

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:15.399
from Bombay I took him down with me to a

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:17.589
place called hooray and it was all in a

00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:20.860
message that says there were no proper

00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:23.800
bathrooms aware it was just like he got

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.899
for second act expected and there

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:29.440
weren't even places to sit down properly

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:31.720
only the beach and the palm trees and

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.380
all sorts of thing was there and the man

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.720
but mustard absolutely lost and he said

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.000
I never wanted this day to finish still

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:44.189
only they are really enjoyed myself

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.449
though because there was such content

00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:55.209
such spontaneous love such attention and

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:58.899
such purity in that to enjoy that purity

00:14:55.209 --> 00:15:00.819
you have to be in collective sitting

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:03.069
down in the room you can't understand

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:05.610
there is no reflection of you can't

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:08.649
understand where are you how far your

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:10.959
collectivity is the most important thing

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:15.339
and those who try to break the

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:18.759
collectivity arguing anti sahaja we call

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:23.509
it a sahaja movement

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:25.429
sahaja activity you have to be one with

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:28.399
the hope those who have tried to

00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:32.269
separate themselves all of them go down

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:37.909
in sahaja yoga try to be one with

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:41.929
everyone to share and enjoy everybody

00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:45.619
speak because God has created you so you

00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:47.749
are salute and the enjoyment should not

00:15:45.619 --> 00:15:50.419
be lost because you have certain

00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:52.429
barriers like some people can't take out

00:15:50.419 --> 00:15:55.579
their shoes I mean just imagine how will

00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:57.679
they are identified with issues they can

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:58.569
take out their shoes to that extent

00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:01.669
they're stupid

00:15:58.569 --> 00:16:04.599
see all this kind of stupidity drops out

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:07.249
once you meet really wise people around

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:11.599
to get rid of all these nonsensical

00:16:07.249 --> 00:16:16.039
ideas which are really haunted your head

00:16:11.599 --> 00:16:18.739
all these days get rid of them and you

00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:22.339
really enjoy everyone

00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:25.519
whether he is a doorman or he is the

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:28.819
chairman all of them are mental it's

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:31.479
nothing more than all that drops up and

00:16:28.819 --> 00:16:34.699
you start enjoying yourself

00:16:31.479 --> 00:16:36.820
that's why collectivity is the only way

00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:40.210
I can work out

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:44.770
I can't think I can work out through the

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:49.480
people who are separated divided it is

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:51.930
said Christ has said also that they said

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.000
what you know what having to do he said

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:57.730
if when you love each other you have

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.280
done that it is just students true and

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:02.470
when I hear the loving conversation of

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.300
the sahaja Yogi's I feel the happiness

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.850
that's the greatest happiness for me

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:10.480
that all of you should love each other

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:12.550
in spirit without any return only for

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.610
love's sake you're or should love each

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:18.220
other and that is what it is and also

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:20.200
Krishna has said wherever people are

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.850
there together together in the name of

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:27.160
God I decided so in the knee joint so

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:30.310
called because you are all one moving

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.560
with one rhythm with one understanding

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:35.800
with one language so you all should

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.870
always meet all each other and have

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:43.030
record with each other it's so beautiful

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:46.350
it's music it's political we understand

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.350
that may God bless

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:57.070
I'd see for yourself when you got out to

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:59.170
a collectivity just abusing yourself at

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.760
that point that this is one thing we are

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:05.020
trying to teach me now I'm not going to

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:07.500
listen to this nonsense we are going to

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:10.120
be in otherwise also I mean we cannot

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.340
people cannot take even drinks without

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.280
somebody in there you can't take your

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:17.980
food alone there's so many things I mean

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:22.630
if you are not absolutely recluse you

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:26.730
can't live alone then in religion in in

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:33.120
the city especially in the realm of all

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:33.120
how can I be you all have to be there

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:44.450
I think it was a very good question

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:49.400
right chaos this individualism must be

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:51.320
given that doesn't mean you dress up

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:55.520
like a military people

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:57.440
that's not fascism or you should all

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.570
behave in the same manner that's not

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.600
necessary what I feel it's all the

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:06.560
beauty but does that mean that if I say

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:18.460
it is it is East you should say it is

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:22.780
West that's the main number case is it

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:25.550
that you can't dive into each other

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:34.120
what's the problem in connectivity

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:34.120
I can ask

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:51.480
must get out of individual limitations I

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:05.530
think everybody for some time more and

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.060
given a national survival but Ashna must

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.590
be such when there is collective dues

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:15.220
now I show me there fighting and

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:17.620
following this reversal yourself being

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.410
in the National ones but I leave it to

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:23.380
you it's all freedom you just decide

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:26.440
yourself I have not any rules and

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:30.250
regulations on how much because I've got

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.950
you to use your wisdom and put

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:39.040
everything right or self you are all

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:42.520
very wise people but first have them God

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.470
listen to others talk to them find out

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.690
what's the problem is on small small

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:49.510
things people find it's a very long

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:52.540
moreover you have to have one person as

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:54.490
a leader to whom you should listen to if

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.440
I find that fellow is useless I'll throw

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.540
him on it you know that throw him away

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.280
not in the way people throw me but he

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.070
just get out of sahaja line you know not

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:06.000
so there should be no problem but

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:10.360
everybody should not try to dominate

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.090
each other that's a valid try to change

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:19.270
your head as I would say how far can you

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:22.810
just how far can you accommodate

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:26.130
let's see that we have to learn that for

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.130
me isn't it

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:32.230
you must find out ways and methods of

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:35.050
accommodating yourself and others just

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:38.050
try to learn it's not difficult that's

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.440
the whole attitude of life is of

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.450
competition

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.940
this another should be changed you must

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:47.330
compete in level conflict in doing good

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.610
things confident working for others like

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:53.480
I won the know now I love take the fall

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:55.600
is very comfortable and watch the TV

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.800
this morning and I will not wash you

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.270
[Music]

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.640
then people start taking advantage

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:04.790
essence let them take advantage

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:10.520
disadvantage wonder actually if you see

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:14.360
the other side competent service

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:18.920
competing love confident good things of

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:21.830
saying good words of communicating in a

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:28.520
sweet away that others feel happy making

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:32.240
others happy try to change your attitude

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.100
towards others and you really enjoy I

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.440
tell you you'll enjoy that's the way you

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.810
know if you say something to hurt

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.760
someone and upset someone it must be

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.740
upsetting you definitely you may not

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.720
sure but it must be because whatever you

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.680
do to others comes back to you straight

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.990
forward march

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:56.750
I take it doesn't stay there altogether

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:58.970
it comes back so just try to be kind you

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.040
may say that the other may try to con

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:03.280
doesn't matter nobody can harm you

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:06.700
because you are the spirit you cannot

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.530
you are the spirit so just try to

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:11.240
understand the person I tell you after

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.070
some time and find that person will

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.890
become very some so many sahaja Yogi's

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:18.890
have become like that automatically we

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:24.050
are here for seeking God isn't it so to

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:26.100
help them you have a patient give up

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:29.430
your old methods and ways I must

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:36.150
to be good to disturb to be angry

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:39.210
there's no need at all I'm telling you

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:47.460
from my experience I've tried my wisdom

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:51.540
it works is it does work and you're

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:57.120
probably and failed in your ascent in

00:23:51.540 --> 00:24:00.360
their quality I like you to move brings

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.540
others to you I don't like people to

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:09.410
criticize others try to support any

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:12.870
children I never talk about their past

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:14.790
or anything like that it's very sad

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:17.880
sometimes I've seen people are very hard

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:20.100
and in anger they say things which one

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:23.010
should never see it's not gracious it's

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.800
not in the mannerism of sahaja Yogi's

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:28.380
you should never say these things do I

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.780
ever say anything like that about your

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.940
past when you write to me I know

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.890
everything about you did I ever mention

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.960
those things to you at all then why

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.030
should you say things of the past I have

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.130
heard these things people just rake it

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:43.500
up and flung it back

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:45.310
I've heard this kind of thing that you

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:49.710
bring it on other people is on

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:52.530
one should be very gracious many time

00:24:49.710 --> 00:25:01.750
and understand that everybody has

00:24:52.530 --> 00:25:05.980
tremendous potential respect yourself

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:08.620
and respect others I hope now you won't

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:11.200
have problem of collectivity after this

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:12.940
lecture and if you are you can listen to

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.750
this lecture again and again and my

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:19.450
special humble request there try to come

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:25.660
down your angles automatically other

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:28.480
angles will come down but if it is a non

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:31.120
surgery then you all should fight it

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.910
together won't you join together if it's

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.920

those days are corner none of you will

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:49.390
be drawn these are all satanic forces

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.210
and they can work through yours we must

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.640
know when they give you such ideas to

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:59.460
fight and to quarrel understand that

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:02.590
this is anti God you are doing horrible

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:06.520
you have to move towards more

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:09.850
understanding more coordination because

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:12.250
this is such a tremendous book and of

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:15.420
such a sublime nature and we have to be

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.420
supplying ourselves

00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:26.190
all right now is there any other

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:28.049
question with a very nice suggestion but

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:31.399
don't give me such big suggestions that

00:26:28.049 --> 00:26:31.399
I have to speak for half an hour

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:57.080
I'll say I just want to get even

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:21.060
you come here and tell people no no she

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:23.220
said that when collectively sahaja

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:27.270
Yogi's become one that those who are not

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:29.760
so lonely and isolated he stops you see

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.820
sahaja Yogi's have to be strong enough

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:36.810
not to eat like that there are people

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.710
say who are in the water and some people

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.320
are at the board

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:43.200
all right now the people who are in the

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:46.260
boat are in the boat so they are in a

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.820
way different from the people who are in

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.010
the water that's the situation

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.840
all right now the people in the boat

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:55.230
have to save the people who are in the

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.060
hope in the in the water right so what I

00:27:55.230 --> 00:28:00.210
am saying that those who are on the boat

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.890
must first of all be united and then

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.810
with full strength will them on why this

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:07.950
collectivity is just to pull out the

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:12.390
rest of them this collectivity is just

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:16.170
to achieve their emancipation their

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:17.940
realization all right it doesn't mean

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:21.240
that is they should exclude that to be

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:24.050
the whole collectivity is to bring those

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:27.570
people are but you see there are what so

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:29.490
anti-god activities going on as well you

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.600
know that for example there's a guru who

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:35.000
makes lots of fun right and he has

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.400
destroyed many people now they

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.039
to me and they're saying so he may send

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.590
somebody here paid for a job just to

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:44.450
disturb us then the duty of all the

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.309
sahaja Yogi's to get together and see

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.679
that you tell him that you see now you

00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:51.200
are doing wrong guru has done wrong to

00:28:48.679 --> 00:28:53.179
us and he's going to do wrong to others

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.970
why do join me that on that point

00:28:53.179 --> 00:28:58.309
everybody should be one but if they are

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:00.799
not strong and if they are not one they

00:28:58.309 --> 00:29:03.280
cannot pull out of us you see my point

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:08.179
is like not to exclude ease all

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:17.270
collectivity is to include everybody all

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:19.669
right I mean to say there is no

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:26.470
specialization in sahaja yoga in simple

00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:26.470
words everybody is a doctor of em

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:48.770
I mean to say that all the sahaja Yogi's

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:52.230
must form a strong by which they achieve

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:55.350
enlargement of sahaja yoga getting more

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:59.670
people into such more people benefited

00:29:55.350 --> 00:30:01.980
by sahaja yoga all right well anyway

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:04.140
have seen wherever there is connectivity

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:08.930
like I would say Australia has the

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:11.460
maximum collected or India positive but

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.590
Australia in all the European countries

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.440
on to the western-style communities

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:19.470
Australia has the maximum connectivity

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:23.130
and there achieve the maximum results

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:27.210
only in Sydney today only one had told

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:31.830
me that the halls like this get packed

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:34.800
for programs very well there is no hope

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:37.200
for new people who are coming and it's

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.570
such a big company I am amazed I mean

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.420
how many must be going there and it is

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.640
because of collectivity and as soon as I

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:47.040
went there it started gathering enough

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.500
but before that the people were fighting

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.270
among themselves and many people ran

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.650
away from sahaja yoga because they

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:57.110
thought these people are fighting what

00:30:52.650 --> 00:31:00.510
are going to give us maximum using

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:04.500
Australia IT and is Austria is having

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:07.350
some problem then I as soon as the

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:09.930
problem came in the whole thing became a

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:12.540
very small group again that problem is

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.550
over now positivity has come the people

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:21.150
have joined together again it has been

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:23.160
nice it happens here was a TLC why

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:27.020
Labour Party lost if they had not

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.020
followed they would not have been so bad

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.820
he's acted simple a simple equation

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:37.869
united we stand
