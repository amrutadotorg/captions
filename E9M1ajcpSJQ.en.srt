1
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:06,260
﻿…. To sustain our Spirit, nourished.

2
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:18,053
I think it is the quality of wisdom

3
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:26,700
which is still lingering, or is
manifesting in many Australians,

4
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:33,390
wisdom part, which many have lost

5
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:41,020
because they have taken to
the gross side of materialism.

6
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:52,993
Shri Ganesha is a tremendous,

7
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,379
purifying power,

8
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,958
tremendous purifying power,

9
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,047
because it cannot be contaminated by anyone.

10
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:05,660
Whatever you may try, it cannot be contaminated.

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,980
Only thing is, it may recede back.

12
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,563
It may not manifest.

13
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:16,700
But wherever it is, it is in its absolute form.

14
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:23,460
If you know how to use
it, you can purify everyone, you and yours, everyone.

15
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,628
You and yours, everyone.

16
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:33,369
So, the responsibility of Australians,
one must understand, is very great,

17
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:41,540
because they are living in a
country which is ruled by Shri Ganesh,

18
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:44,798
So first they have to maintain their purity.

19
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,740
Purity of their being.

20
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:54,740
Many people sometimes think that
purity is only limited to the gross side -

21
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,351
that you lead a sensible sex
life is sufficient. It is not so.

22
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:05,500
That’s why Christ has said
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

23
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:09,540
Meaning, your eyes should be clean.

24
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,988
And as you know, eyes
represent your ego and super-ego both.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,820
So, when He said that your eyes should be clean,

26
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:29,277
He meant that your thoughts should be clean.

27
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:33,700
Now, what is the generator of your power?

28
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:39,907
We have to go deep into it
and see how thoughts are generated.

29
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:46,340
The brain of human beings
as you know, is like a pyramid.

30
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:54,740
It’s elevated to a certain point
Here in a conical way.

31
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,540
It’s the epitome, it’s the Brahmarandhra.

32
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:07,700
And when this mind

33
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,920
elevates to that state in human beings

34
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:17,500
it goes into a tremendous change of its reactions,

35
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:22,460
to its environment.

36
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:28,060
For example, an animal, if it sees a thing,

37
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,945
it doesn’t think about it.
There’s no reaction created.

38
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,500
But only in human beings this reaction takes place

39
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:45,090
because of its conical brain,

40
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:51,460
we can say that this attention that’s coming in,

41
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,514
goes into a parallelogram of forces

42
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:03,940
because we have two
types of densities in our brain.

43
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,660
There is also refraction,

44
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:13,577
and because of refraction this
parallelogram of forces acts in such a way

45
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:16,582
that your attention goes out,

46
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:22,380
and the attention that goes out, reacts.

47
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,922
And when it reacts,

48
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,141
the thought waves start coming in to us.

49
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:32,660
You must have seen a lake.

50
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:36,180
If you drop a stone in a lake,

51
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:42,060
the waves start and they
come to the shores of the lake,

52
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:49,300
and then it is the shore that gives
 it another wave which goes back.

53
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:56,100
In the same way, when 
human beings look at anything,

54
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:00,340
they put attention to it,

55
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,140
there is always a reaction that comes to you.

56
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:13,222
Now according to Christ, we have to have
non-adulterous eyes. There should be no adultery.

57
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:16,540
The word adultery in the pure sense is not so bad.

58
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:23,900
Adultery means there should not be
any mixture of what it exists, simple as that.

59
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,660
When we say there is adulteration in the milk,

60
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,180
we mean that it’s not purely milk 
but there’s something else in it, all right.

61
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,500
So, when you look at things - say this is a wall.

62
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,220
A wall is a wall that’s all;
what is there to think about it?

63
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:51,140
But a person who is not a realized soul
will immediately start thinking about a wall even.

64
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:56,145
Now depending upon the conditioning of a person,

65
00:05:56,345 --> 00:06:02,020
if a person is a very perverted soul, I
don’t know what he would think of the wall

66
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:08,140
because I can’t go to every limit of thinking
also-I’m sorry I have certain limitations.

67
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,859
But a person who is say a normal person,

68
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,300
also may start thinking about
the wall: how much it will cost

69
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,141
and what will happen and this and that

70
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:24,940
all sorts of conditionings according to the
money point of view because he is money oriented.

71
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:31,140
If he is ego-oriented, then his
thoughts would go reacting that same way.

72
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:34,851
This is the adulteration.
That when you look at things

73
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:38,756
there is nothing to think
about. What is there to think?

74
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:41,500
Whatever is, it is.

75
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:46,060
But we think that by
thinking we solve the problems.

76
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,820
Also, this kind of a myth
exists among human beings,

77
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,100
that when you look at something or you think
about something then you solve the problem.

78
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,260
It’s not true. It’s a myth,

79
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,969
because thinking is just 
an empty process of the mind.

80
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:07,197
It’s like a wave passing toward the shore

81
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:12,860
and thinks that it can just
engulf it or dissolve it completely.

82
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:19,900
So, the thought is just an
empty vessel which carries nothing.

83
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:26,300
It cannot do anything; it cannot
bring forth any fruit whatsoever.

84
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:31,874
Sometimes this statement might look very
big and you might think: "How can that be Mother?

85
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,995
We’ve done so much by thinking" and this and that.

86
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:39,220
But you’ve not. Whatever you
have done is through spontaneity

87
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:44,480
because the unconscious has helped you,
has given you the ideas, the inspiration.

88
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:49,220
You have done everything through
inspiration and not by your own thinking.

89
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:53,700
Now there we do not want to agree,
because we have to give up our ego

90
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,495
because then we think we have
achieved it through our thinking.

91
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:02,300
But when you think too much, too much,
too much, like that, then what happens?

92
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,740
The unconscious gives you
the necessary information,

93
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:14,380
because it has compassion, it has love for
you and suddenly you find something there.

94
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,275
You are just pushed into
that corner where you find it.

95
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:20,580
And for this, you must know,
Einstein is the person who says

96
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,860
that the theory of relativity dawned
upon him from somewhere unknown,

97
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,433
because whatever is known is already there.

98
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:33,340
And whatever is unknown you cannot
find out by this brain which is thinking,

99
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,508
but by the brain which is enlightened.

100
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:42,420
Now when He said,
 “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

101
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:48,140
of course the adultery as we understand
is that we should not have lust in our eyes.

102
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,420
But I would go still further to say

103
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,314
that our attention has to be so pure

104
00:08:56,514 --> 00:09:01,132
that we should not have any return,

105
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:05,619
idea of return coming to
us from a particular thing,

106
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,420
but just enjoying it, just the joy part of it.

107
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:14,020
If I see a beautiful thing,
then I am just enjoying it,

108
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:18,278
not that I should possess it,
nor should I think about it,

109
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,420
nor do I need that I should repeat it.

110
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,900
Just enjoy it as it is.

111
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,060
Maybe if you just enjoy it
you will just create it again.

112
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:32,300
That’s the capacity one
should have of purification.

113
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:39,100
So, sometimes people think that Sahaja
Yoga is a very Victorian sort of a system

114
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,140
in which you can’t lead a life like
this and the freedom we have achieved,

115
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:48,861
the abandonment we have achieved,
we cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga.

116
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:59,220
But this virtue or this righteousness

117
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,900
that we have condemned so
far is really the sustainer of life,

118
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,300
is our quality, is our gold, is our wealth,

119
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:12,620
is our property, is our security

120
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,327
which we have lost.

121
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:20,120
And we have to just -

122
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:25,213
again have a cleansing.

123
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:31,518
It is there because if it is
fundamentally eternal it cannot be lost,

124
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:35,540
it cannot be permanently destroyed.

125
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,300
It is like, you have seen a
brass metal or something like that,

126
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,956
gets covered with atmosphere -

127
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:47,020
black, red, yellow, every
sort of a colour and ruined.

128
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,820
But again, you polish it out, it comes back.

129
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:57,216
But if it is gold, it is
untarnish, it is untarnishable.

130
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:04,300
But if gold is allowed to rust in the dirty,

131
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,126
gutter or something, you cannot see it.

132
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:16,580
It's covered with all kinds of things
and you think it is just finished now.

133
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:21,784
It exists, all the time
our innocence exists within us.

134
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:28,020
It’s not lost, it’s there, only it’s covered.
Just like the sky can be covered with clouds,

135
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,740
it is covered now because of the atmosphere,

136
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,279
because of the way we try to
dent it, through all kinds of things.

137
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,618
That’s why I say don’t feel guilty,

138
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:41,986
because if you feel guilty then
you have a hand which is weak,

139
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:45,267
a mind which is wobbly,

140
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,700
and then you don’t want to cleanse yourself.

141
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:54,940
But it exists all the time within
us, untarnishable it exists within.

142
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:57,727
You have to just get to it.

143
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:01,780
Now Shri Ganesha is the 
one who does that job for us.

144
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,300
He is the one who cleanses it.

145
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:09,900
That not He is the embodiment
of purity, but He does that job.

146
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,980
Only a person, or only the Deity
which is the embodiment of purity can do it.

147
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,220
As like you can see a soap.

148
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:24,756
Soap is the one which in quality
is a pure thing and it purifies too.

149
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:29,540
Supposing it is not pure,
it can become contaminated.

150
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,031
In the same way our innocence is absolutely pure.

151
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:40,540
So it is our innocence itself
cures ourselves. Just see this.

152
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:44,616
The one which is lying under,
which we have always repressed,

153
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:48,710
which we have undermined,
which we have not respected,

154
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:53,380
comes to our help, and shines within us.

155
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:59,757
It’s such a great blessing that we have
so many eternal things existing within us,

156
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,460
otherwise human beings would
have been finished a long time back.

157
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:11,740
There would have been no trace of human beings
the way they have been playing about with their chastity,

158
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:17,420
with their real power of their character.

159
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:27,499
So, when it is very much always impressed
in every religion that you have to lead a proper life,

160
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:33,060
a sane life, the reason is
this gold that is within us

161
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:38,380
must be made to shine. And
the brilliance of such a face, you can see

162
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:43,020
You can see a person who
leads a very fast life, as you call it:

163
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,100
this sallow face the sad life,

164
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,426
and all kinds of unhappy lines on his face.

165
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:59,180
But a person who starts shining one’s own being,

166
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:03,500
with that wisdom

167
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,340
and that purity beams, absolutely beams

168
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,820
with the lustre of Shri Ganesh.

169
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,453
The innocence of Shri Ganesh, His playfulness,

170
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:25,148
His joy.. joy.. enjoying, the way He enjoys joy,

171
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:30,540
the way He manifests joy. He is 
the source of all the joys of the world.

172
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:36,098
Now in the English language
there are no names given to joys.

173
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:42,820
There is only one-word joy, and I find it
sometimes difficult to describe the different kinds of "joy"

174
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,417
that you can have at
different levels of our evolution.

175
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:52,820
But when you get to your
Sahasrara the joy is called nirananda.

176
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,420
Now Nira is my name, you
know that. Ananda means joy.

177
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:01,460
Nira means: where there is nothing else but joy.

178
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,380
There is complete joy, no reaction,
nothing. Just submerged in joy.

179
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:12,300
That quality also evolves
through the quality of Shri Ganesha.

180
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:20,324
It’s the Shri Ganesha who evolves
that quality of nirananda within us.

181
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:25,260
He goes into evolution gradually, as you
see up to Agnya Chakra becomes Christ.

182
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:32,971
That doesn't mean that He goes into evolution,
but we can say a seed growing into that tree.

183
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:40,608
And ultimately what we find is that we are
sitting on top of that tree enjoying like children.

184
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:48,220
The joy that our heavenly Father
has bestowed upon us at the Sahasrara.

185
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:54,260
Now the puja part of it one should understand:

186
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:57,420
It is very important in Sahaja Yoga,

187
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:03,928
but everybody should not be exposed to
puja to begin with, from two points of view.

188
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:12,020
Sometimes the people who come to
puja actually are not really worthy of it. 

189
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:17,540
Not worthy of it. And then they react, they react to puja.

190
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:23,700
They think: why this puja? And this
is subservient and all sorts of things,

191
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:30,180
because they are not worthy of it; they have to
find out some excuse to justify their unworthiness.

192
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,660
So, we have to first find out if
the person is worthy of puja or not.

193
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:42,062
If the person is not worthy, it is better to leave
the person alone till he becomes worthy of it.

194
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:49,646
because doubts and all those things can
obstruct the flow of vibrations to other people

195
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:52,700
and such a person can create a problem for others.

196
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:56,980
So, it is not civil of that
person also to be in the puja.

197
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:03,260
If the person has not got an open
heart and an understanding of what puja is.

198
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:12,300
Doing puja to any Deity as such is not
an easy thing, especially to Shri Ganesha.

199
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:16,788
Those people who do puja
to Shri Ganesha should know

200
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:24,988
that of course it has to be a Swayambhu,
means the one that is created by Mother Earth.

201
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,560
No other Ganesha should be worshipped.

202
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:31,860
And if they are not a realized
soul, they can never worship Shri Ganesha.

203
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,460
They cannot even think of Him,
 they cannot even take His name.

204
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,937
It is so difficult to reach Shri Ganesha.

205
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:44,620
But after realization the first thing you
have to do is to worship Shri Ganesha

206
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:49,220
because that’s the basis
on which you got your realization.

207
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,180
He’s the one first who got His crucifixion

208
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:02,140
then His resurrection, and He is the one
who opened the path of realization for you.

209
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,660
So you have to worship Him before
any other Deity. With the greatest sacrifices,

210
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:16,660
The greatest evolutionary ascent He achieved
for your sake to become a human being, to die,

211
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,020
and to suffer like a human being so that you
should not find it difficult to get your realization.

212
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:27,738
Today when we say: "It’s so easy, how do you get it,"

213
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:34,519
we forget that people have done a lot of
work to achieve it for you, to create the path.

214
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:38,540
Like supposing I come to Perth.

215
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,991
Say, when I was studying in
schools, I used to read the word Perth,

216
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:51,900
and I couldn't not imagine that Indians could easily reach
Perth so easily from say just fly out and you are just there.

217
00:18:52,100 --> 00:19:00,100
But it’s possible today that we have achieved
this kind of an ascent from India to Perth so easily

218
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:03,020
because people have worked for it.

219
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:08,580
People have sacrificed. How many
people must have died creating an aeroplane?

220
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:11,397
How many must have had
shocks and things like that?

221
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:18,140
We are so privileged to use
their sacrifices for our benefit.

222
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,180
We take it all for granted.

223
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,337
In the same way in spiritual ascent when
we say it’s easy, it’s not so easy as you think,

224
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:30,740
because it has worked out
since ages in a very deep way,

225
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:34,420
and even your Mother has
worked very hard to achieve it.

226
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,420
So, somebody has done the job.

227
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:43,540
So if it is easy you should thank your stars that it’s not
difficult for you, instead of doubting it: Why is it so easy?

228
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,380
That you want to contribute
something to it, alright you can,

229
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,572
but first take advantage of what is available
and then you can contribute also something more to it.

230
00:19:53,773 --> 00:20:00,700
If you have not known an ordinary aeroplane,
how are you going to build a complicated one?

231
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,260
So first know that whatever
is achieved in Self-Realization

232
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,860
and the cleansing power of Shri Ganesha.

233
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:18,501
Establish Shri Ganesha within you. First of all, you must establish Him, and then you can use it for others,

234
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:25,486
for yourself, and for bettering and bettering
the methods of Sahaja Yoga that you have learnt.

235
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,300
That’s how Shri Ganesha is so
important for all the Sahaja Yogis, 

236
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,620
to be understood in all its aspects.

237
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:40,700
But this principle is very

238
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:44,860
enormous, I should say.

239
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:50,860
The principle is very 
spread out. It’s very subtle.

240
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:55,740
So to understand it in all its
aspects, is not an easy thing.

241
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,500
The only thing you can do is
to become one with it, like the ocean.

242
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,054
If you become one with the
ocean, you become the ocean.

243
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:06,820
Just become one with it
and that’s how it works out.

244
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:12,940
But if you use your brains to understand
it, your brain cannot even capture a wink of it.

245
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,060
So the best thing is that you
just be humble about the whole process,

246
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,860
just to try to become one with it.

247
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:27,620
And those who can achieve that will
realize that they have become joy themselves

248
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,740
and they have those joy-giving qualities.

249
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,822
They have those qualities by which
they just give bliss and peace to others.

250
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:42,420
Just they being there itself is
sufficient to create this feeling.

251
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:46,955
I always had great hopes on Australia,

252
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:55,202
and I am sure that one day it
will happen here in a big way.

253
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:02,820
And when it happens here, we’ll
achieve greater results in other places.

254
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:11,900
I have to work hard, and you all have to work very
hard to understand the importance of this country,

255
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:16,157
your importance as Australians.

256
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:22,505
Just before Puja, I would like, anyone
who has a genuine question you should to ask Me,

257
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:28,780
because I don’t want that at Puja time, should
have any problems, if you have any problems...

258
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,300
...Shri Ganesha himself is
(unclear), he is the word 'sta'.

259
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,300
He is the one who makes you settle down,

260
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,179
the word is 'sta' like (unclear)

261
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,380
The one who is a householder,
is the one who stays in the house,

262
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,861
who makes you stay or

263
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:13,585
makes you.. stick.

264
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,785
Yogi: Establish.

265
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:20,008
Shri Mataji: Established, 
established, established in that place.

266
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:25,000
Established - I don't know...  

267
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,600
We can say it's (about). 

268
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,743
Established” means more it is very (unclear). Little closer term.

269
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:39,240
...Sita.
Warren: Settled?

270
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:44,441
Shri Mataji: Settled you 
can say, settled.. all these

271
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:51,523
Or we should say rooted, keeps
you rooted is a better word. Rooted.

272
00:23:55,214 --> 00:24:02,057
So, My great message to 
Perth: this centre is the door.

273
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:08,100
This is the door of Shri Ganesha,

274
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:13,060
and you have to find out more 
people who are true seekers.

275
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:19,329
And don’t quarrel with people who are
doubting Sahaja Yoga, just don’t quarrel.

276
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,380
Gradually all of them have to come
and if they don’t come don’t despair,

277
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,746
that’s all right, that’s their luck.

278
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:29,340
So, you just don’t argue on that point.

279
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,535
Don’t waste your energy arguing with them.

280
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:38,624
We have other methods of convincing 
them: of giving them bandhan of,

281
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:47,368
of all the nirmala vidyas that you use.

282
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:53,100
So, you don’t get despaired and you don’t get 
angry with them, because they’re ignorant.

283
00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,940
And you must know your past also, how
you behaved towards Sahaja Yoga in the beginning

284
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,740
and then you will be kind to them. Be kind.

285
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:06,409
Gradually everyone has to
come, those who are seekers.

286
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,605
We’ll see that they’re all in
before we close the doors.

287
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,370
Who do, you do the puja? Come, good.

288
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:54,580
Did I give you these this 
time, this is your last (unclear).

289
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:04,712
This must have come from Shri Ganesh.

290
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:20,229
Warren: We would have like to have
taken you to Ayres Rock this time Mother to…

291
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:23,210
Shri Mataji: Yes, I would 
love to see, but how far is it?

292
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:29,380
Warren: It’s quite a long way and it means
one air journey to Alice Springs to the Centre

293
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,033
and then another smaller plane to the
place, we could do it, if you wish but...

294
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,121
Shri Mataji: Will do next year, doesn't matter.

295
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:41,300
Warren: It’s such a 
beautiful place full of vibrations.

296
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,723
Shri Mataji: I’ll see photographs, we should
get some more photographs of people to see.

297
00:26:45,923 --> 00:26:49,138
You see, Indians, when I tell them,
they havent seen the photograph

298
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:52,232
so if you could have some film or
something, they would love to see.

299
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,914
Warren: Actually we could 
put together a little exhibition.

300
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,980
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can see the 
trunk going like that, can you imagine,

301
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,380
what more you want? 
That expression of Shri Ganesh.

302
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:09,250
Warren: And it’s exactly on 
the parallel latitude of Chindwara.

303
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,811
Shri Mataji: As Chindwara. 
Warren: As it is North, so it is so.

304
00:27:13,012 --> 00:27:15,545
Shri Mataji: It's Capricorn? On the Capricorn.

305
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:20,855
Warren: Exactly, not 
within a few degrees but exactly!

306
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,940
Shri Mataji: What is the latitude?

307
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:30,859
Warren: Erm twenty, I've got it written and 
it's 22 and a half, 23 degrees. But it's a little -

308
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,222
Shri Mataji: And altitude?

309
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:42,839
Warren: I think it’s on a plateau 
about 1800 feet or something like that!

310
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,511
Shri Mataji: What do you called? 
Warren: The elevation of the hill, the moutains?

311
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:50,020
Shri Mataji: You see, we have two things. 
Warren: Oh longitude, sorry. Shri Mataji: Longitude.

312
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,420
Warren: I don't know. We better
check that, does anyone have a....

313
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:59,540
Shri Mataji: We should find 
out what is on the other side of it!

314
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:54,420
Warren: Should we begin by
saying the... Your Mantras Mother?

315
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,609
And then shall we begin with Your
Mantras and Shri Ganesha’s Mantras.

316
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,300
Shri Mataji: Yes, Shri Ganesha’s Mantras
is all right... sing Shri Ganesha's Mantras...

317
00:29:04,024 --> 00:29:05,980
washing my feet please

318
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,260
So my feet are Shri Ganesha.

319
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:13,370
The Hands are Shri Krishna.

00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,785
And the head is the Adi Shakti
