Adi Shakti Puja. Nirmal Nagari, Canajoharie, NY (USA),
2 July 2000.

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:18.320
Today we have come here to do the Adi Shakti Puja.

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:28.064
I have already told you about the Adi Shakti,  how

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:36.236
She had to work out so many things in this world —

00:00:38.128 --> 00:00:43.663
first to create and then

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:50.023
to create human beings through evolutionary process.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.566
After that, to comfort.

00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:04.456
Then to counsel.

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:12.273
So many people here came on this Earth just to do the counselling.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:17.875
They told what was wrong, what was right,

00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:21.943
what should we do, what we should not do,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.443
what is self-respect and what is the

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:38.979
duty of a human being as a superior-most creature.

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:41.976
So many of Them came on this Earth.

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:46.677
One after another, in every country, They came

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.898
and Their counselling formed religions.

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:56.544
Of course, you see the mess of the religions

00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:59.697
and that’s how Their life was wasted,

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.466
that They formed religions after religions,

00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:13.744
by which only human beings were divided,

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:20.983
divided to such an extent they hate each other.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.519
Hateful, somebody’s born in an X religion,

00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:31.755
he hates the person who follows the Y religion.

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:35.785
While Those who came as counsellors

00:02:36.762 --> 00:02:39.955
talked about complete unity,

00:02:40.896 --> 00:02:43.777
complete oneness of human race,

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:50.339
despite that, human brain, in its freedom,

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:54.605
did all kinds of wrong things

00:02:55.211 --> 00:03:00.062
and created a country or,

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:06.626
you can say the whole world, full of lots of problems

00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:10.407
arising out of religion.

00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:18.002
How can it be that religion makes you hate somebody?

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.509
Religion is there to understand love,

00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:26.877
imbibe love and compassion.

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:37.706
So the third thing one had to do is the Adi Shakti’s job,

00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:42.585
that is the one Kundalini within us.

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:51.679
And, by the awakening, we got pure knowledge, absolute knowledge,

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:57.521
pure knowledge that it cannot be challenged.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.802
Absolute it is!

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:06.077
Whatever you know after Realization is absolute.

00:04:08.256 --> 00:04:13.197
If you know that, then what you have to understand,

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:19.409
that everything has to be united.

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:27.607
You cannot have fights and you cannot hate anyone.

00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:31.835
If that thing starts happening,

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:37.063
all the problems of the world will be finished.

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:40.344
So the first thing, redemption,

00:04:40.743 --> 00:04:44.092
that is the quality of the Adi Shakti,

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:52.074
was to redeem people of their all wrong ideas about others.

00:04:53.517 --> 00:04:58.209
Firstly, as we know, there are six enemies we have got.

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:05.400
And unless and until we can conquer those six enemies,

00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:09.627
we cannot be a religious person. That is what is said,

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:14.073
but actually the all religions are based only

00:05:14.284 --> 00:05:19.153
on prospering those six enemies that we have within ourselves.

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:24.824
When you see this clearly, you start seeking,

00:05:25.134 --> 00:05:28.046
you start seeking, seeking

00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:34.215
earnest, the Truth.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.154
And the revelation of truth,

00:05:39.575 --> 00:05:44.744
absolute truth, can only come through your evolution,

00:05:44.904 --> 00:05:46.877
through your reformation

00:05:47.203 --> 00:05:53.833
that you become person who knows the Truth.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.538
For that, Adi Shakti’s ascent is important within you,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.491
which is your Kundalini.

00:06:02.314 --> 00:06:05.607
And when this thing takes place,

00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:11.239
automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have.

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:18.987
You become a beautiful human being.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.794
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state,

00:06:26.521 --> 00:06:30.822
it looks like all other small

00:06:34.235 --> 00:06:38.537
animals, or small, you can say, very, very,

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:41.382
small dirty things that are in the pond.

00:06:43.793 --> 00:06:46.574
And then, once it starts coming out,

00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:54.525
coming out of that horrible water,

00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:58.982
it becomes such a beautiful flower,

00:06:59.692 --> 00:07:05.078
rises up and opens out.
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi,

00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:11.720
though he lives along with all these horrible things
that are going on,

00:07:12.873 --> 00:07:16.359
but flowers like a lotus.

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.897
It doesn’t have all these insects,

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:25.082
all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives.

00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:30.232
It sucks only the pure water

00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:35.776
and the remnant, the others remain there as it is.

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:39.250
So what is left within you

00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:45.048
is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance,

00:07:46.315 --> 00:07:49.140
just like a lotus.

00:07:50.755 --> 00:07:56.887
Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.209
by all of these small, small creatures in the water

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:06.181
or all the dirty things that are in the water.

00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:13.151
And this state that you have achieved now,

00:08:13.923 --> 00:08:18.544
I’m very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it.

00:08:19.952 --> 00:08:22.302
You see, it’s a very great blessing,

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:28.476
because America is the leading country in so many ways.

00:08:29.543 --> 00:08:33.798
One can say that it has made lots of money.

00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:40.893
That is not the criteria of becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:45.573
What you get is the satisfaction,

00:08:46.514 --> 00:08:54.359
satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have
and whatever others have.

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:59.431
And the second thing that happens to you,

00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:02.145
you become absolutely collective.

00:09:02.982 --> 00:09:05.180
This has to happen.

00:09:06.153 --> 00:09:12.099
But I find still people have not understood
the meaning of collectivity.

00:09:12.938 --> 00:09:18.503
For example, family is very, very weak here.

00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:27.401
Family that has been created by natural relationships

00:09:28.027 --> 00:09:31.836
is not so much respected as it should have.

00:09:32.983 --> 00:09:37.587
It’s all because, based on money, so people start

00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:43.915
quarrelling, fighting and even killing each other.

00:09:46.756 --> 00:09:52.503
Now the basis of family is love and compassion.

00:09:53.247 --> 00:09:57.322
Those who do not have this cannot have good families.

00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.627
I’ve seen even among Sahaja Yogis sometimes,

00:10:01.957 --> 00:10:05.615
some people who are working for money,

00:10:06.494 --> 00:10:11.802
who are educated, sometimes look down upon people

00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:14.578
who are not so well off.

00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:18.660
Or maybe the housewives who are working in the house,

00:10:18.999 --> 00:10:22.836
looking after the children, building up the families

00:10:22.994 --> 00:10:29.517
are not treated with respect as some secretary in the

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.153
some organization.

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:38.847
I don’t know why this kind of a manliness comes into women.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.044
Why should they think they are something higher

00:10:43.224 --> 00:10:45.770
than the women who are working hard

00:10:45.914 --> 00:10:50.566
in the household, cooking, looking after children,

00:10:51.092 --> 00:10:55.910
bearing all the brunt of the society.

00:10:57.482 --> 00:11:03.172
This is something, I feel, is a part which is lacking very much

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:07.333
in America and also Western countries.

00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:10.873
When money becomes important,

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:13.981
if when money is important,

00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:20.306
then the Lakshmi principle is not respected.

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:22.338
Very surprising.

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:26.119
Money is the part which is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:28.547
but the Gruha Lakshmi is the one

00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:31.975
who is a householder, is not respected.

00:11:33.186 --> 00:11:35.681
And with this, I tell you,

00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:40.679
there’s a… very, very wrong things can happen.

00:11:41.646 --> 00:11:45.423
You can work, you can be educated,

00:11:45.783 --> 00:11:49.678
but you should be able to look after your family

00:11:50.054 --> 00:11:55.304
and look after their comfort and look after their unity.

00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:00.035
Instead of that, educated women,

00:12:00.258 --> 00:12:03.258
I call them manly women,

00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:08.213
educated women think that they are something higher,
they are sadly mistaken.

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:12.698
In no way, a man is higher than a woman.

00:12:13.752 --> 00:12:16.772
So this kind of a disparity that exists

00:12:17.343 --> 00:12:20.739
and one starts thinking that: “We are earning.

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:22.887
We are educated”

00:12:23.306 --> 00:12:26.355
are really manly women, I must say.

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:31.470
But the women who work very hard in a household with love,

00:12:32.565 --> 00:12:36.496
look after the children, look after the family,

00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:41.393
are in no way less than these people who are working in the office.

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:45.359
So, such women must be respected

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:49.267
by their husbands, by the men,

00:12:49.592 --> 00:12:51.899
members  of the family — not only that,

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:55.310
but all the Sahaja Yogis must respect such women,

00:12:55.484 --> 00:12:58.866
who are doing such a difficult task.

00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:03.013
I’ve been a housewife and I know what it is

00:13:04.038 --> 00:13:07.534
to run the house, to look after the children,

00:13:07.831 --> 00:13:11.940
to look after the complete organization

00:13:12.388 --> 00:13:16.261
and looking after the expenditure

00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:19.593
of the money, if that is limited.

00:13:20.998 --> 00:13:24.374
This ego has to go.

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:29.818
The other day, one lady, she came in interview and asked Me

00:13:30.034 --> 00:13:35.761
that: “How is it, in this world of men, you are so much respected?”

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:41.458
World of men —I was really laughing.

00:13:41.826 --> 00:13:46.059
What makes her think that is the world of men, I can’t understand.

00:13:46.319 --> 00:13:48.979
Can they exist without women?”

00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:54.273
But I was amazed at her question because she said

00:13:54.414 --> 00:13:59.321
that: “Even in the jail, criminals are so much respectful,

00:13:59.804 --> 00:14:01.491
how is it possible?

00:14:01.686 --> 00:14:05.523
How can they have so much respect for a women?”

00:14:06.316 --> 00:14:10.080
I said: “I can’t understand one thing,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.068
that criminals have got mothers or not?”

00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:19.318
They are all males, don’t they have a mother?

00:14:19.794 --> 00:14:24.770
They all have a mother and they respect the mother.

00:14:25.997 --> 00:14:28.044
That’s the point one should know,

00:14:28.319 --> 00:14:32.437
that woman is a much more important thing

00:14:32.731 --> 00:14:37.189
than the man is, as far as the children are concerned.

00:14:38.674 --> 00:14:42.482
But I’ve seen even some ladies,

00:14:42.603 --> 00:14:46.204
who think they are very capable, try to control everything

00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:48.785
and create problems.

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:53.414
And mother’s job is not to control.

00:14:54.163 --> 00:14:57.590
Her job is to love, to give compassion

00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:01.275
and this is the quality of women is lost

00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:04.434
in these Western, so-called advanced,

00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:09.201
It is a very dangerous thing. I personally think

00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:14.177
that, if such a thing happens, families will be destroyed.

00:15:14.437 --> 00:15:19.752
Nobody will have respect for the lady who looks after the family.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:24.633
And she is more than a prime minister, I would say, in a family

00:15:25.088 --> 00:15:28.427
and she’s to be respected and to be understood.

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:33.662
Today, I think it is important to say

00:15:34.103 --> 00:15:38.559
that all of you should understand the value of women

00:15:38.861 --> 00:15:40.829
who are housewives.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.644
It’s a tremendous job

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:48.021
to be a housewife. I have gone through it and I know what it is.

00:15:50.321 --> 00:15:53.465
If the respect for the housewife is not given…

00:15:54.597 --> 00:15:59.292
She will also look after the children.

00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:02.948
Children are tomorrow’s citizens.

00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:06.901
Who will groom them? Who will bring them up?

00:16:07.996 --> 00:16:11.415
All those manly women don’t also have children sometimes,

00:16:11.906 --> 00:16:14.588
so they don’t know what is the problem of children.

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:18.915
At least those who are solving the problem of their children,

00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:22.334
you must understand their responsibility.

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:28.132
This is a very, very crucial point, I think on which

00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:31.627
all the Western societies are collapsing,

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:35.442
because in their culture there is no place for the mother.

00:16:39.544 --> 00:16:42.429
So, the women should not feel in any way less

00:16:42.624 --> 00:16:45.437
if they are mothers and looking after the household.

00:16:45.632 --> 00:16:48.169
They should not feel inferior to anybody

00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:51.660
who thinks that they are something great.

00:16:53.384 --> 00:16:56.896
Basically, the families have to be good.

00:16:57.689 --> 00:17:01.028
This collectivity must work first in the family.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.454
The children are to be groomed properly.

00:17:04.887 --> 00:17:07.410
They are to be brought up in a proper way.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.677
As it is, in these days, you know what is happening to the children.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:15.069
When I read about it, I’m really shocked that

00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:20.824
children are just treated as if they’re some unwanted stuff.

00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:24.470
They are not given any attention.

00:17:25.068 --> 00:17:29.835
Ultimately, the children become drug addicts,

00:17:30.196 --> 00:17:33.628
they become vagabonds or anything. They can become anything,

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:37.205
because there’s so much, so much neglect

00:17:37.422 --> 00:17:40.494
and so much of hatred for children.

00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:46.649
So one has to first remember that, for collectivity,

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.918
you must look after your children.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.366
Not only that, with love and compassion,

00:17:58.584 --> 00:18:04.915
not as somebody who is trying to become a despot out of it,

00:18:05.348 --> 00:18:09.770
but a person who is a source,

00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:13.700
who is a source of joy and compassion.

00:18:15.264 --> 00:18:19.101
In one of My lectures, I talked to you about

00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:22.671
the emotional intelligence.

00:18:25.699 --> 00:18:28.382
That is what we should try to imbibe.

00:18:29.097 --> 00:18:32.774
Emotional intelligence, that means

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.065
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

00:18:39.401 --> 00:18:42.798
Unless and until we become emotionally intelligent,

00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:44.991
our society cannot work.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:50.212
In an emotional intelligence, you care

00:18:50.981 --> 00:18:53.308
and you enjoy caring.

00:18:54.232 --> 00:18:59.043
You do everything for others

00:18:59.859 --> 00:19:03.341
with a great emotional understanding.

00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:06.484
Not for one child, not for one son,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:12.298
but for everyone you have to be emotionally intelligent.

00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:17.411
Some children are born like this, but some are to be made like that,

00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:21.197
that they should be emotionally intelligent.

00:19:22.873 --> 00:19:28.030
Because, if the mother and father are money-oriented,

00:19:28.672 --> 00:19:33.402
very selfish, they wouldn’t allow their child

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.092
to give anything to others.

00:19:36.706 --> 00:19:41.429
So such a child will grow into a very funny type of a person

00:19:42.144 --> 00:19:46.953
and will never do anything for anybody not even for his own country.

00:19:47.278 --> 00:19:51.215
Why should he? Everything for selfishness.

00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:55.672
Then such people indulge into corruption,

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:58.758
indulge into all kinds of things,

00:19:58.953 --> 00:20:02.970
which are only selfish in attitude.

00:20:04.462 --> 00:20:07.117
Now we are talking of collectivity.

00:20:07.816 --> 00:20:11.104
In collectivity, we do for others.

00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:14.450
We enjoy doing for others.

00:20:15.237 --> 00:20:19.231
We love giving things to others, not for yourself,

00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:22.953
because your children will also become the same kind

00:20:23.148 --> 00:20:25.636
and they will only bother about themselves.

00:20:28.312 --> 00:20:32.912
This emotional intelligence has to be brought in our life.

00:20:33.497 --> 00:20:38.147
In our pattern that we have, are we emotionally

00:20:38.956 --> 00:20:45.114
intelligent or we are just intelligent or emotional?

00:20:46.008 --> 00:20:47.608
Both things are wrong.

00:20:47.897 --> 00:20:51.381
If you are just intelligent, you can become very dry person.

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:57.590
You may just have few friends maybe, you may not have

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.190
and you will always try to preserve yourself away

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.925
from the collectivity.

00:21:05.803 --> 00:21:09.922
And if you are emotional, you’ll be attached to only one person,

00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:15.446
attached to one child, attached to one person,

00:21:15.806 --> 00:21:18.893
to someone, even in the society.

00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:23.653
For no rhyme or reason. Why? Why are you attached to one person?

00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:28.643
Why you bothered about one person only?

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.869
All such people fall into such terrible play.

00:21:33.287 --> 00:21:35.471
In the politics you have seen how,

00:21:35.616 --> 00:21:37.772
people try to help their own sons

00:21:37.873 --> 00:21:40.326
and own daughters and this and that.

00:21:40.427 --> 00:21:43.016
And we Indians have suffered a lot with this

00:21:43.325 --> 00:21:46.088
kind of an emotional attachment.

00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:56.096
So, according to ethics,

00:21:57.134 --> 00:22:02.191
emotional intelligence is the highest quality,

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:07.484
by which you give to others,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.701
you care for others, for everyone

00:22:13.934 --> 00:22:17.028
and you become very, very collective.

00:22:20.677 --> 00:22:24.556
Now exclusiveness is another fashion

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.327
that’s very miserable, it’s exclusive.

00:22:28.069 --> 00:22:30.914
because you don’t want to be one of the multitudes.

00:22:31.023 --> 00:22:33.341
You want to be exclusive.

00:22:34.318 --> 00:22:41.926
You should be exclusive in emotional intelligence,
not on other things.

00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:45.670
That is the best thing that you can have.

00:22:46.044 --> 00:22:50.227
As I agree, I am just a woman and just a mother,

00:22:51.469 --> 00:22:57.209
but what I have is really the emotional intelligence,

00:22:57.627 --> 00:23:03.988
ocean of it, and from that I know about everyone,

00:23:05.703 --> 00:23:07.895
I understand about everyone.

00:23:08.552 --> 00:23:13.752
And all this work has been done because of that quality in My head.

00:23:14.106 --> 00:23:19.535
I’m not attached to one person or to one style.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.244
Whatever you say, I can understand,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.125
because I am at a level

00:23:26.263 --> 00:23:30.166
where I can understand everything that you are doing.

00:23:31.146 --> 00:23:36.396
To achieve that, you try to develop emotional intelligence.

00:23:37.246 --> 00:23:41.624
Here the children won’t even give a toy to somebody to play with.

00:23:43.852 --> 00:23:48.503
Even the mother is like that, the father is like that,
extremely selfish

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:53.528
and: “We must have our own, you see, everything should be our own.”

00:23:54.631 --> 00:24:00.378
This has to go. This has to go, from Americans especially, because

00:24:00.515 --> 00:24:05.796
they are the leading nation in this kind of selfishness.

00:24:08.377 --> 00:24:12.048
What selfishness they have done, I need not count,
but you know that.

00:24:12.791 --> 00:24:15.956
You go and ask the people of Canada, Mexico,

00:24:16.165 --> 00:24:18.502
Peru, all this, they will tell you.

00:24:19.396 --> 00:24:22.317
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.922
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

00:24:28.475 --> 00:24:33.769
Nobody can even tell them,
because they think they are very rich people.

00:24:35.052 --> 00:24:40.115
But all these riches will not give them the joy of life.

00:24:41.586 --> 00:24:46.974
Joy of life is only in the emotional intelligence.

00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:51.170
If you don’t have that, it becomes very dry.

00:24:51.372 --> 00:24:54.949
Life becomes very odd, unbearable, horrible

00:24:55.368 --> 00:24:59.954
and even the family gets broken,

00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:03.833
if there is no emotional intelligence in the family.

00:25:04.883 --> 00:25:07.075
I have known so many women

00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:10.004
who have had three marriages, five marriages.

00:25:10.105 --> 00:25:11.728
I don’t know how they can do it.

00:25:11.965 --> 00:25:16.120
But they’ve done because of this lack of emotional intelligence.

00:25:17.705 --> 00:25:22.307
It is something that is a sense of giving.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.175
It's not that your sacrifising anything, no.

00:25:27.421 --> 00:25:29.050
That’s also another idea,

00:25:29.187 --> 00:25:32.223
that we are to bear this —nothing of the kind.

00:25:33.586 --> 00:25:36.470
Look at the life of Christ, He gave His life.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.650
Why? What was the need for Him to do that?

00:25:40.531 --> 00:25:42.802
Behind Him was the Truth.

00:25:43.617 --> 00:25:46.819
When you have the Truth with you, the light of the Truth,

00:25:46.931 --> 00:25:49.834
the force of the Truth, the strength of the Truth,

00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:53.466
you become emotionally intelligent.

00:25:55.043 --> 00:25:58.586
You understand that, if you really love something,

00:25:58.752 --> 00:26:04.492
then you have to undergo every kind of trouble.

00:26:04.948 --> 00:26:07.304
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:09.287
I know it’s too much to say,

00:26:09.431 --> 00:26:15.804
but I thought that, for this special Puja, I should say something

00:26:15.963 --> 00:26:17.766
about the family life.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.462
In our ashrams or in our programs

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.911
or wherever we are, we should remember this point,

00:26:27.207 --> 00:26:32.918
that: “Are we having that emotional intelligence

00:26:33.055 --> 00:26:35.623
when we are trying to talk among Sahaja Yoga?”

00:26:37.476 --> 00:26:41.724
Why do I need to be every place to tell them? What is the need?

00:26:42.264 --> 00:26:43.836
You can tell them.

00:26:44.226 --> 00:26:47.378
If you have that emotional intelligence,

00:26:47.724 --> 00:26:50.550
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

00:26:50.814 --> 00:26:53.338
Not necessary I should go everywhere

00:26:53.472 --> 00:26:56.257
and talk to them. How many countries can I do?

00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:59.696
And the reaction to it is so beautiful

00:26:59.927 --> 00:27:03.043
and so nice. It’s very surprising.

00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:07.218
Like in a country like Benin country, all Muslims there,

00:27:07.536 --> 00:27:12.424
all black people, they all have become Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand.

00:27:14.379 --> 00:27:16.524
How could I capture that?

00:27:17.026 --> 00:27:21.106
Just think of that. Nine thousand people come to you!

00:27:21.718 --> 00:27:24.754
Then also other countries I have seen.

00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:29.204
Just this is the power of emotional intelligence

00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:31.850
that captures the heart of the people.

00:27:33.156 --> 00:27:37.790
You may have any amount of property, money, everything,

00:27:37.978 --> 00:27:40.992
people will abhor you. Alright.

00:27:41.649 --> 00:27:44.252
So you may say: “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with this?”

00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:52.978
That you are harming the greatest thing, is the human being.

00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:58.113
And the politicians they are horrible, as they say.

00:27:58.748 --> 00:28:01.957
Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence.

00:28:03.082 --> 00:28:09.782
Also as administrators, they are very much difficult,

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:12.133
because they have no emotional intelligence.

00:28:14.331 --> 00:28:19.135
All these people are devoid of that great quality

00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:21.385
of emotional intelligence.

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.904
If your country is very progressive,

00:28:25.048 --> 00:28:28.633
I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence.

00:28:29.488 --> 00:28:31.897
That way, they have philanthropists, I know.

00:28:32.383 --> 00:28:34.719
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:38.815
But behind that is they want to have power.

00:28:41.815 --> 00:28:44.252
They want to rule people with that money.

00:28:45.586 --> 00:28:50.246
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they just want to rule.

00:28:50.671 --> 00:28:54.024
If they start some sort of a charity,

00:28:54.543 --> 00:28:58.668
that is just to have a big name on the television,

00:28:58.906 --> 00:29:04.575
or to have a very great advertisement about, “Oh, him!”

00:29:04.778 --> 00:29:07.900
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

00:29:09.248 --> 00:29:12.961
We part of their  [UNCLEAR]   we part of their property

00:29:13.676 --> 00:29:16.906
work it out and make such a fuss about it,

00:29:17.187 --> 00:29:20.000
because they want to cash everything…

00:29:20.209 --> 00:29:22.575
Cash has been lots of cashed  in

00:29:23.542 --> 00:29:25.702
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.425
You have to send waves of emotional intelligence.

00:29:30.923 --> 00:29:35.041
You have to send love to all over the world.

00:29:35.653 --> 00:29:39.771
You have to show how you can, with love, win over.

00:29:40.442 --> 00:29:44.430
It is also possible, if you are not so attached.

00:29:44.898 --> 00:29:48.194
If you are attached, say to your country only—

00:29:48.491 --> 00:29:50.171
now this is a bigger issue —

00:29:50.392 --> 00:29:54.281
then you will try to exploit other countries,

00:29:54.578 --> 00:29:57.974
take advantage of them, try to run them down.

00:29:58.247 --> 00:30:01.016
But if you are emotionally attached to your country,

00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:05.683
then you’ll bring good name to your country by doing real good work.

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:10.709
I don’t know why people do not know how to discriminate.

00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:14.596
Why are they so selfish, trying to bring them up,

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.897
trying to do all the good things for themselves?

00:30:23.407 --> 00:30:26.761
There is a very great chance for all of you

00:30:27.692 --> 00:30:30.525
to get this within your reach,

00:30:30.663 --> 00:30:32.856
because you are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:33.223 --> 00:30:35.336
You have become like lotuses.

00:30:35.646 --> 00:30:39.455
And the lotus has the fragrance which spreads all over

00:30:40.426 --> 00:30:44.401
and, days together it stays in the water, in that dirty water,

00:30:44.689 --> 00:30:47.509
and it spreads the fragrance.

00:30:47.805 --> 00:30:50.943
With that fragrance also, you can do lots of things,

00:30:51.208 --> 00:30:55.283
that the bees come there, they sleep in that

00:30:56.192 --> 00:30:59.040
beautiful house of the lotus

00:30:59.494 --> 00:31:03.353
and in the night it closes down very carefully.

00:31:03.684 --> 00:31:06.569
All kinds of things that come from the flower

00:31:10.964 --> 00:31:22.783
to take the beauty

00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:24.770
of that flower,

00:31:25.097 --> 00:31:28.971
we can say, because you can extract also

00:31:29.112 --> 00:31:31.752
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

00:31:32.386 --> 00:31:36.534
You can also get some honey out of that.

00:31:36.764 --> 00:31:40.659
Whatever is possible, everybody comes to that flower.

00:31:41.558 --> 00:31:45.035
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way is weak,

00:31:45.207 --> 00:31:49.318
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

00:31:52.499 --> 00:31:56.336
That’s what you are. You are all made into lotuses.

00:31:57.289 --> 00:32:00.295
You are not made into some sort of creeps

00:32:00.454 --> 00:32:05.365
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

00:32:06.718 --> 00:32:12.048
You are the people who are to give fragrance of your love,

00:32:12.308 --> 00:32:15.798
fragrance of your compassion to others.

00:32:15.993 --> 00:32:17.954
And you should feel happy about it.

00:32:18.726 --> 00:32:20.839
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,

00:32:20.947 --> 00:32:22.736
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

00:32:23.154 --> 00:32:25.447
But it means that, whatever you have,

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.036
whatever is your possibility, capability,

00:32:28.209 --> 00:32:32.413
you must try to do for others, give it to them.

00:32:33.522 --> 00:32:36.276
And the more you do in this collectivity…

00:32:36.493 --> 00:32:40.402
That’s what is very important, at least for America,

00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:43.799
because everybody is trying to follow America,

00:32:44.872 --> 00:32:47.952
money-making business, this business, that thing.

00:32:49.752 --> 00:32:51.590
But you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:54.764
so what you have to do is take

00:32:55.997 --> 00:33:01.369
advantage of your achievement and give this to others,

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:05.848
give Realisation to others. Many people who get Realisation

00:33:06.121 --> 00:33:08.329
don’t even bother about it.

00:33:09.165 --> 00:33:11.876
They just don’t go and spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:12.417 --> 00:33:14.378
They are not bothered about it.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.112
Which is sometimes very shocking to Me,

00:33:17.349 --> 00:33:19.274
because what was the need for Me

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:23.286
to go around the whole world with all the mad people living,

00:33:23.473 --> 00:33:25.823
and talking to them about Sahaja Yoga?

00:33:26.797 --> 00:33:29.385
In the same way, you should also feel now

00:33:29.602 --> 00:33:32.351
that:  “We have to do this work, we have to change the world.

00:33:32.611 --> 00:33:34.643
We have to get them into Sahaja Yoga.”

00:33:34.788 --> 00:33:36.972
Why can’t we? We are so many people.

00:33:37.117 --> 00:33:39.172
Christ had only twelve disciples,

00:33:39.316 --> 00:33:41.690
and how much they spread Christianity!

00:33:42.677 --> 00:33:46.693
What about you people? You are so well equipped,

00:33:46.866 --> 00:33:48.943
you have so much of knowledge,

00:33:49.206 --> 00:33:53.451
absolute knowledge and experience.

00:33:54.093 --> 00:33:56.934
So if you have the experience and the knowledge,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.480
you can capture the people.

00:34:00.128 --> 00:34:03.605
But there is some sort of a lurking ambition,

00:34:05.321 --> 00:34:09.432
which goes against, against the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:11.774
You want to be leader,

00:34:11.861 --> 00:34:13.665
or you want to put down somebody,

00:34:13.788 --> 00:34:16.607
or you think no end of yourself. That’s no good.

00:34:16.722 --> 00:34:20.090
And also they do Sahaja Yoga or spread Sahaja Yoga

00:34:20.198 --> 00:34:22.132
because they want to enhance themselves.

00:34:25.173 --> 00:34:29.625
This is not the way. The way is a complete surrendering,

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:34.005
complete surrender to the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:34.848 --> 00:34:38.584
It’s possible, it’s not difficult at all, as I’m telling you.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.559
It’s very, very simple.

00:34:40.732 --> 00:34:42.979
Only thing, you should understand

00:34:43.102 --> 00:34:48.022
that you have a special place in the whole universe today.

00:34:50.025 --> 00:34:52.088
You are not to rot.

00:34:52.787 --> 00:34:55.117
You are not to waste your life.

00:34:56.833 --> 00:34:59.003
We have started marriages,

00:34:59.256 --> 00:35:02.336
and in America also they said.
I said: “Alright, we’ll have marriages.”

00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:05.769
But these marriages, what is the outcome?

00:35:06.013 --> 00:35:09.173
If they are like all other ordinary marriages, what’s the use?

00:35:09.748 --> 00:35:12.257
What are they doing for others?

00:35:12.511 --> 00:35:14.897
What sort of children they are producing?

00:35:15.187 --> 00:35:17.003
You have to see to it

00:35:17.251 --> 00:35:21.713
that you become married couples in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:26.012
Your family should be a different type,

00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:29.668
your love for your family should be of a different type.

00:35:30.373 --> 00:35:33.648
The whole family of Sahaja Yoga also needs your family.

00:35:34.134 --> 00:35:38.037
So, for everyone, you must have compassion and love.

00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:41.188
I know some people grow very fast,

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.375
but some don’t, because they lack this

00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:48.033
balance between emotion and intelligence.

00:35:48.508 --> 00:35:52.395
This balance has to be completely established.

00:35:52.611 --> 00:35:57.429
And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people,

00:35:57.695 --> 00:36:02.758
so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:03.162 --> 00:36:06.522
So far, whatever was wrong was adopted:

00:36:07.021 --> 00:36:10.583
drug addiction starts, then another thing starts.

00:36:10.828 --> 00:36:16.077
All kinds of nonsensical things started in this country.
Why?

00:36:18.394 --> 00:36:22.489
Now, the new lotuses that are there,

00:36:22.792 --> 00:36:26.007
they have to change the atmosphere of this lake,

00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:29.319
where all kinds of dirty things are coming up,

00:36:29.694 --> 00:36:33.415
immoral things are coming up, ruining the whole world.

00:36:34.063 --> 00:36:36.789
So, in our general attitude also,

00:36:37.943 --> 00:36:41.672
we should try to see: “Are we really following?

00:36:42.176 --> 00:36:44.736
Are we really doing what is to be done?

00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:47.340
What are we doing for morality?”

00:36:48.147 --> 00:36:51.342
That’s a very important point in Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.489
how you dress, how you walk, how you talk,

00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:57.861
everything’s very important,

00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:01.835
and all other things that you have, you should try.

00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:08.153
How to create, and all these things of different, different Chakras,

00:37:08.578 --> 00:37:10.979
you should try to concentrate on them

00:37:11.152 --> 00:37:13.532
and see for yourself what are you doing?

00:37:15.162 --> 00:37:17.736
What are you making out of your life?

00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:21.083
You are Sahaja Yogis. You are special people.

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:24.148
You are not ordinary. I want to tell you

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.746
that you should have self-esteem. Try to understand

00:37:28.864 --> 00:37:31.475
what is your quality, what are you.

00:37:32.319 --> 00:37:35.701
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!
