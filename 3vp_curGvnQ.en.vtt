00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:09.498
Adi Shakti Puja. Nirmal Nagari, Canajoharie, NY (USA),
2 July 2000.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:18.381
Today we have come here to do the Adi Shakti Puja.

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:28.125
I have already told you about the Adi Shakti, how

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:36.297
She had to work out so many things in this world —

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:43.724
first to create and then

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:50.084
to create human beings through evolutionary process.

00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:55.627
After that, to comfort.

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:04.517
Then to counsel.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:12.334
So many people here came on this Earth just to do the counselling.

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:17.936
They told what was wrong, what was right,

00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:22.004
what should we do, what we should not do,

00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:29.504
what is self-respect and what is the

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:39.040
duty of a human being as a superior-most creature.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.037
So many of Them came on this Earth.

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:46.738
One after another, in every country, They came

00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:52.959
and Their counselling formed religions.

00:01:53.603 --> 00:01:56.605
Of course, you see the mess of the religions

00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:59.758
and that’s how Their life was wasted,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.527
that They formed religions after religions,

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:13.805
by which only human beings were divided,

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:21.044
divided to such an extent they hate each other.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.580
Hateful, somebody’s born in an X religion,

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:31.816
he hates the person who follows the Y religion.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.846
While Those who came as counsellors

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:40.016
talked about complete unity,

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:43.838
complete oneness of human race,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.400
despite that, human brain, in its freedom,

00:02:51.053 --> 00:02:54.666
did all kinds of wrong things

00:02:55.272 --> 00:03:00.123
and created a country or,

00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:06.687
you can say the whole world, full of lots of problems

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.468
arising out of religion.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:18.063
How can it be that religion makes you hate somebody?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.570
Religion is there to understand love,

00:03:23.962 --> 00:03:26.938
imbibe love and compassion.

00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:37.767
So the third thing one had to do is the Adi Shakti’s job,

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:42.646
that is the one Kundalini within us.

00:03:44.388 --> 00:03:51.740
And, by the awakening, we got pure knowledge, absolute knowledge,

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:57.582
pure knowledge that it cannot be challenged.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.863
Absolute it is!

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:06.138
Whatever you know after Realization is absolute.

00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:13.258
If you know that, then what you have to understand,

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.470
that everything has to be united.

00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:27.668
You cannot have fights and you cannot hate anyone.

00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:31.896
If that thing starts happening,

00:04:33.177 --> 00:04:37.124
all the problems of the world will be finished.

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:40.405
So the first thing, redemption,

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:44.153
that is the quality of the Adi Shakti,

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:52.135
was to redeem people of their all wrong ideas about others.

00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:58.270
Firstly, as we know, there are six enemies we have got.

00:04:59.806 --> 00:05:05.461
And unless and until we can conquer those six enemies,

00:05:05.893 --> 00:05:09.688
we cannot be a religious person. That is what is said,

00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:14.134
but actually the all religions are based only

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:19.214
on prospering those six enemies that we have within ourselves.

00:05:21.897 --> 00:05:24.885
When you see this clearly, you start seeking,

00:05:25.195 --> 00:05:28.107
you start seeking, seeking

00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:34.276
earnest, the Truth.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.215
And the revelation of truth,

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:44.805
absolute truth, can only come through your evolution,

00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:46.938
through your reformation

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:53.894
that you become person who knows the Truth.

00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:59.599
For that, Adi Shakti’s ascent is important within you,

00:05:59.671 --> 00:06:01.552
which is your Kundalini.

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:05.668
And when this thing takes place,

00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:11.300
automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have.

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:19.048
You become a beautiful human being.

00:06:19.861 --> 00:06:25.855
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state,

00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:30.883
it looks like all other small

00:06:34.296 --> 00:06:38.598
animals, or small, you can say, very, very,

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:41.443
small dirty things that are in the pond.

00:06:43.854 --> 00:06:46.635
And then, once it starts coming out,

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:54.586
coming out of that horrible water,

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:59.043
it becomes such a beautiful flower,

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:05.139
rises up and opens out.
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi,

00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:11.781
though he lives along with all these horrible things
that are going on,

00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:16.420
but flowers like a lotus.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.958
It doesn’t have all these insects,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.143
all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives.

00:07:26.742 --> 00:07:30.293
It sucks only the pure water

00:07:30.882 --> 00:07:35.837
and the remnant, the others remain there as it is.

00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:39.311
So what is left within you

00:07:39.756 --> 00:07:45.109
is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance,

00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:49.201
just like a lotus.

00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:56.948
Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked

00:07:57.631 --> 00:08:02.270
by all of these small, small creatures in the water

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:06.242
or all the dirty things that are in the water.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:13.212
And this state that you have achieved now,

00:08:13.984 --> 00:08:18.605
I’m very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it.

00:08:20.013 --> 00:08:22.363
You see, it’s a very great blessing,

00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:28.537
because America is the leading country in so many ways.

00:08:29.604 --> 00:08:33.859
One can say that it has made lots of money.

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:40.954
That is not the criteria of becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:42.643 --> 00:08:45.634
What you get is the satisfaction,

00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:54.420
satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have
and whatever others have.

00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:59.492
And the second thing that happens to you,

00:08:59.603 --> 00:09:02.206
you become absolutely collective.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.241
This has to happen.

00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:12.160
But I find still people have not understood
the meaning of collectivity.

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:18.564
For example, family is very, very weak here.

00:09:19.742 --> 00:09:27.462
Family that has been created by natural relationships

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:31.897
is not so much respected as it should have.

00:09:33.044 --> 00:09:37.648
It’s all because, based on money, so people start

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.976
quarrelling, fighting and even killing each other.

00:09:46.817 --> 00:09:52.564
Now the basis of family is love and compassion.

00:09:53.308 --> 00:09:57.383
Those who do not have this cannot have good families.

00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:01.688
I’ve seen even among Sahaja Yogis sometimes,

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.676
some people who are working for money,

00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:11.863
who are educated, sometimes look down upon people

00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:14.639
who are not so well off.

00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:18.721
Or maybe the housewives who are working in the house,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.897
looking after the children, building up the families

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:29.578
are not treated with respect as some secretary in the

00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:33.214
some organization.

00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:38.908
I don’t know why this kind of a manliness comes into women.

00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:43.105
Why should they think they are something higher

00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:45.831
than the women who are working hard

00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:50.627
in the household, cooking, looking after children,

00:10:51.153 --> 00:10:55.971
bearing all the brunt of the society.

00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:03.233
This is something, I feel, is a part which is lacking very much

00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:07.394
in America and also Western countries.

00:11:08.374 --> 00:11:10.934
When money becomes important,

00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:14.042
if when money is important,

00:11:14.338 --> 00:11:20.367
then the Lakshmi principle is not respected.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.399
Very surprising.

00:11:22.508 --> 00:11:26.180
Money is the part which is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.608
but the Gruha Lakshmi is the one

00:11:28.724 --> 00:11:32.036
who is a householder, is not respected.

00:11:33.247 --> 00:11:35.742
And with this, I tell you,

00:11:36.376 --> 00:11:40.740
there’s a… very, very wrong things can happen.

00:11:41.707 --> 00:11:45.484
You can work, you can be educated,

00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:49.739
but you should be able to look after your family

00:11:50.115 --> 00:11:55.365
and look after their comfort and look after their unity.

00:11:56.712 --> 00:12:00.096
Instead of that, educated women,

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:03.319
I call them manly women,

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:08.274
educated women think that they are something higher,
they are sadly mistaken.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.759
In no way, a man is higher than a woman.

00:12:13.813 --> 00:12:16.833
So this kind of a disparity that exists

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:20.800
and one starts thinking that: “We are earning.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.948
We are educated”

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:26.416
are really manly women, I must say.

00:12:27.254 --> 00:12:31.531
But the women who work very hard in a household with love,

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:36.557
look after the children, look after the family,

00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:41.454
are in no way less than these people who are working in the office.

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:45.420
So, such women must be respected

00:12:46.025 --> 00:12:49.328
by their husbands, by the men,

00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:51.960
males of the family — not only that,

00:12:52.227 --> 00:12:55.371
but all the Sahaja Yogis must respect such women,

00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:58.927
who are doing such a difficult task.

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:03.074
I’ve been a housewife and I know what it is

00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:07.595
to run the house, to look after the children,

00:13:07.892 --> 00:13:12.001
to look after the complete organization

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:16.322
and looking after the expenditure

00:13:17.223 --> 00:13:19.654
of the money, if that is limited.

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:24.435
This ego has to go.

00:13:25.732 --> 00:13:29.879
The other day, one lady, she came in interview and asked Me

00:13:30.095 --> 00:13:35.822
that: “How is it, in this world of men, you are so much respected?”

00:13:37.444 --> 00:13:41.519
World of men —I was really laughing.

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:46.120
What makes her think that is the world of men, I can’t understand.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.040
Can they exist without women?”

00:13:49.552 --> 00:13:54.334
But I was amazed at her question because she said

00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:59.382
that: “Even in the jail, criminals have so much respect for You,

00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:01.552
how is it possible?

00:14:01.747 --> 00:14:05.584
How can they have so much respect for a women?”

00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:10.141
I said: “I can’t understand one thing,

00:14:10.321 --> 00:14:14.129
that criminals have got mothers or not?”

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:19.379
They are all males, don’t they have a mother?

00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:24.831
They all have a mother and they respect the mother.

00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:28.105
That’s the point one should know,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.498
that woman is a much more important thing

00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:37.250
than the man is, as far as the children are concerned.

00:14:38.735 --> 00:14:42.543
But I’ve seen even some ladies,

00:14:42.664 --> 00:14:46.265
who think they are very capable, try to control everything

00:14:46.972 --> 00:14:48.846
and create problems.

00:14:50.387 --> 00:14:53.475
And mother’s job is not to control.

00:14:54.224 --> 00:14:57.651
Her job is to love, to give compassion

00:14:57.875 --> 00:15:01.336
and this is the quality of women is lost

00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:04.495
in these Western, so-called advanced country.

00:15:05.916 --> 00:15:09.262
It is a very dangerous thing. I personally think

00:15:09.572 --> 00:15:14.238
that, if such a thing happens, families will be destroyed.

00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:19.813
Nobody will have respect for the lady who looks after the family.

00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:24.694
And she is more than a prime minister, I would say, in a family

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:28.488
and she’s to be respected and to be understood.

00:15:30.074 --> 00:15:33.723
Today, I think it is important to say

00:15:34.164 --> 00:15:38.620
that all of you should understand the value of women

00:15:38.922 --> 00:15:40.890
who are housewives.

00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:44.705
It’s a tremendous job

00:15:44.807 --> 00:15:48.082
to be a housewife. I have gone through it and I know what it is.

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:53.526
If the respect for the housewife is not given…

00:15:54.658 --> 00:15:59.353
She will also look after the children.

00:16:00.702 --> 00:16:03.009
Children are tomorrow’s citizens.

00:16:03.392 --> 00:16:06.962
Who will groom them? Who will bring them up?

00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:11.476
All those manly women don’t also have children sometimes,

00:16:11.967 --> 00:16:14.649
so they don’t know what is the problem of children.

00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:18.976
At least those who are solving the problem of their children,

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:22.395
you must understand their responsibility.

00:16:23.743 --> 00:16:28.193
This is a very, very crucial point, I think on which

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.688
all the Western societies are collapsing,

00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:35.503
because in their culture there is no place for the mother.

00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:42.490
So, the women should not feel in any way less

00:16:42.685 --> 00:16:45.498
if they are mothers and looking after the household.

00:16:45.693 --> 00:16:48.230
They should not feel inferior to anybody

00:16:48.346 --> 00:16:51.721
who thinks that they are something great.

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:56.957
Basically, the families have to be good.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.089
This collectivity must work first in the family.

00:17:02.041 --> 00:17:04.515
The children are to be groomed properly.

00:17:04.948 --> 00:17:07.471
They are to be brought up in a proper way.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.738
As it is, in these days, you know what is happening to the children.

00:17:11.258 --> 00:17:15.130
When I read about it, I’m really shocked that

00:17:16.256 --> 00:17:20.885
children are just treated as if they’re some unwanted stuff.

00:17:22.013 --> 00:17:24.531
They are not given any attention.

00:17:25.129 --> 00:17:29.896
Ultimately, the children become drug addicts,

00:17:30.257 --> 00:17:33.689
they become vagabonds or anything. They can become anything,

00:17:33.863 --> 00:17:37.266
because there’s so much, so much neglect

00:17:37.483 --> 00:17:40.555
and so much of hatred for children.

00:17:42.246 --> 00:17:46.710
So one has to first remember that, for collectivity,

00:17:46.841 --> 00:17:50.979
you must look after your children.

00:17:53.301 --> 00:17:57.427
Not only that, with love and compassion,

00:17:58.645 --> 00:18:04.976
not as somebody who is trying to become a despot out of it,

00:18:05.409 --> 00:18:09.831
but a person who is a source,

00:18:10.184 --> 00:18:13.761
who is a source of joy and compassion.

00:18:15.325 --> 00:18:19.162
In one of My lectures, I talked to you about

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:22.732
the emotional intelligence.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.443
That is what we should try to imbibe.

00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:32.835
Emotional intelligence, that means

00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:37.126
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

00:18:39.462 --> 00:18:42.859
Unless and until we become emotionally intelligent,

00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:45.052
our society cannot improve.

00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:50.273
In an emotional intelligence, you care

00:18:51.042 --> 00:18:53.369
and you enjoy caring.

00:18:54.293 --> 00:18:59.104
You do everything for others

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.402
with a great emotional understanding.

00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:06.545
Not for one child, not for one son,

00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:12.359
but for everyone you have to be emotionally intelligent.

00:19:13.822 --> 00:19:17.472
Some children are born like this, but some are to be made like that,

00:19:17.962 --> 00:19:21.258
that they should be emotionally intelligent.

00:19:22.934 --> 00:19:28.091
Because, if the mother and father are money-oriented,

00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:33.463
very selfish, they wouldn’t allow their child

00:19:33.731 --> 00:19:36.153
to give anything to others.

00:19:36.767 --> 00:19:41.490
So such a child will grow into a very funny type of a person

00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:47.014
and will never do anything for anybody not even for his own country.

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:51.276
Why should he do it? Everything for selfishness.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.733
Then such people indulge into corruption,

00:19:56.173 --> 00:19:58.819
indulge into all kinds of things,

00:19:59.014 --> 00:20:03.031
which are only selfish in attitude.

00:20:04.523 --> 00:20:07.178
Now we are talking of collectivity.

00:20:07.877 --> 00:20:11.165
In collectivity, we do for others.

00:20:12.269 --> 00:20:14.511
We enjoy doing for others.

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:19.292
We love giving things to others, not for yourself,

00:20:19.487 --> 00:20:23.014
because your children will also become the same kind

00:20:23.209 --> 00:20:25.697
and they will only bother about themselves.

00:20:28.373 --> 00:20:32.973
This emotional intelligence has to be brought in our life.

00:20:33.558 --> 00:20:38.208
In our pattern that we have, are we emotionally

00:20:39.017 --> 00:20:45.175
intelligent or we are just intelligent or emotional?

00:20:46.069 --> 00:20:47.669
Both things are wrong.

00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:51.442
If you are just intelligent, you can become very dry person.

00:20:52.445 --> 00:20:57.651
You may just have few friends maybe, you may not have

00:20:58.401 --> 00:21:02.251
and you will always try to preserve yourself away

00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:04.986
from the collectivity.

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:09.983
And if you are emotional, you’ll be attached to only one person,

00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:15.507
attached to one child, attached to one person,

00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:18.954
to someone, even in the society.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.714
For no rhyme or reason. Why? Why are you attached to one person?

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.704
Why you bothered about one person only?

00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:32.930
All such people fall into such terrible play.

00:21:33.348 --> 00:21:35.532
In the politics you have seen how,

00:21:35.677 --> 00:21:37.833
people try to help their own sons

00:21:37.934 --> 00:21:40.387
and own daughters and this and that.

00:21:40.488 --> 00:21:43.077
And we Indians have suffered a lot with this

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:46.149
kind of an emotional attachment.

00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:56.157
So, according to ethics,

00:21:57.195 --> 00:22:02.252
emotional intelligence is the highest quality,

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.545
by which you give to others,

00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:12.762
you care for others, for everyone

00:22:13.995 --> 00:22:17.089
and you become very, very collective.

00:22:20.738 --> 00:22:24.617
Now exclusiveness is another fashion

00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:27.388
that’s very miserly, it’s exclusive.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.975
because you don’t want to be one of the multitudes.

00:22:31.084 --> 00:22:33.402
You want to be exclusive.

00:22:34.379 --> 00:22:41.987
You should be exclusive in emotional intelligence,
not on other things.

00:22:42.673 --> 00:22:45.731
That is the best thing that you can have.

00:22:46.105 --> 00:22:50.288
As I agree, I am just a woman and just a mother,

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:57.270
but what I have is really the emotional intelligence,

00:22:57.688 --> 00:23:04.049
ocean of it, and from that I know about everyone,

00:23:05.764 --> 00:23:07.956
I understand about everyone.

00:23:08.613 --> 00:23:13.813
And all this work has been done because of that quality in My head.

00:23:14.167 --> 00:23:19.596
I’m not attached to one person or to one style.

00:23:20.151 --> 00:23:24.305
Whatever you say, I can understand,

00:23:24.471 --> 00:23:26.186
because I am at a level

00:23:26.324 --> 00:23:30.227
where I can understand everything that you are doing.

00:23:31.207 --> 00:23:36.457
To achieve that, you try to develop emotional intelligence.

00:23:37.307 --> 00:23:41.685
Here the children won’t even give a toy to somebody to play with.

00:23:43.913 --> 00:23:48.564
Even the mother is like that, the father is like that,
extremely selfish

00:23:49.351 --> 00:23:53.589
and: “We must have our own, you see, everything should be our own.”

00:23:54.692 --> 00:24:00.439
This has to go. This has to go, from Americans especially, because

00:24:00.576 --> 00:24:05.857
they are the leading nation in this kind of selfishness.

00:24:08.438 --> 00:24:12.109
What selfishness they have done, I need not count,
but you know that.

00:24:12.852 --> 00:24:16.017
You go and ask the people of Canada, Mexico,

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:18.563
Peru, all this, they will tell you.

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:22.378
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

00:24:23.121 --> 00:24:25.983
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

00:24:28.536 --> 00:24:33.830
Nobody can even tell them,
because they think they are very rich people.

00:24:35.113 --> 00:24:40.176
But all these riches will not give them the joy of life.

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:47.035
Joy of life is only in the emotional intelligence.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.231
If you don’t have that, it becomes very dry.

00:24:51.433 --> 00:24:55.010
Life becomes very odd, unbearable, horrible

00:24:55.429 --> 00:25:00.015
and even the family gets broken,

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:03.894
if there is no emotional intelligence in the family.

00:25:04.944 --> 00:25:07.136
I have known so many women

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.065
who have had three marriages, five marriages.

00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:11.789
I don’t know how they can do it.

00:25:12.026 --> 00:25:16.181
But they’ve done because of this lack of emotional intelligence.

00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:22.368
It is something that is a sense of giving.

00:25:23.551 --> 00:25:27.236
It's not that your sacrifising anything, no.

00:25:27.482 --> 00:25:29.111
That’s also another idea,

00:25:29.248 --> 00:25:32.284
that we are to bear this —nothing of the kind.

00:25:33.647 --> 00:25:36.531
Look at the life of Christ, He gave His life.

00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:39.711
Why? What was the need for Him to do that?

00:25:40.592 --> 00:25:42.863
Behind it was the Truth.

00:25:43.678 --> 00:25:46.880
When you have the Truth with you, the light of the Truth,

00:25:46.992 --> 00:25:49.895
the force of the Truth, the strength of the Truth,

00:25:50.227 --> 00:25:53.527
you become emotionally intelligent.

00:25:55.104 --> 00:25:58.647
You understand that, if you really love something,

00:25:58.813 --> 00:26:04.553
then you have to undergo every kind of trouble.

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:07.365
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.348
I know it’s too much to say,

00:26:09.492 --> 00:26:15.865
but I thought that, for this special Puja, I should say something

00:26:16.024 --> 00:26:17.827
about the family life.

00:26:18.391 --> 00:26:22.523
In our ashrams or in our programs

00:26:22.711 --> 00:26:26.972
or wherever we are, we should remember this point,

00:26:27.268 --> 00:26:32.979
that: “Are we having that emotional intelligence

00:26:33.116 --> 00:26:35.684
when we are trying to talk about Sahaja Yoga?”

00:26:37.537 --> 00:26:41.785
Why do I need to be every place to tell them? What is the need?

00:26:42.325 --> 00:26:43.897
You can tell them.

00:26:44.287 --> 00:26:47.439
If you have that emotional intelligence,

00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:50.611
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:53.399
Not necessary I should go everywhere

00:26:53.533 --> 00:26:56.318
and talk to them. How many countries can I do?

00:26:57.212 --> 00:26:59.757
And the reaction to it is so beautiful

00:26:59.988 --> 00:27:03.104
and so nice. It’s very surprising.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.279
Like in a country like Benin country, all Muslims there,

00:27:07.597 --> 00:27:12.485
all black people, they all have become Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.585
How could I capture that?

00:27:17.087 --> 00:27:21.167
Just think of that. Nine thousand people so much limit of...

00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:24.815
Then also other countries I have seen.

00:27:25.413 --> 00:27:29.265
Just this is the power of emotional intelligence

00:27:29.394 --> 00:27:31.911
that captures the heart of the people.

00:27:33.217 --> 00:27:37.851
You may have any amount of property, money, everything,

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:41.053
people will abhor you. Alright.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.313
So you may say: “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with this?”

00:27:44.658 --> 00:27:53.039
That you are harming the greatest thing, is the human being.

00:27:54.872 --> 00:27:58.174
And the politicians they are horrible, as they say.

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:02.018
Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence.

00:28:03.143 --> 00:28:09.843
Also as administrators, they are very much difficult,

00:28:09.937 --> 00:28:12.194
because they have no emotional intelligence.

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:19.196
All these people are devoid of that great quality

00:28:19.477 --> 00:28:21.446
of emotional intelligence.

00:28:22.528 --> 00:28:24.965
If your country is very progressive,

00:28:25.109 --> 00:28:28.694
I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence.

00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:31.958
That way, they are philanthropists, I know.

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:34.780
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

00:28:35.127 --> 00:28:38.876
But behind that is they want to have power.

00:28:41.876 --> 00:28:44.313
They want to rule people with that money.

00:28:45.647 --> 00:28:50.307
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they just want to rule.

00:28:50.732 --> 00:28:54.085
If they start some sort of a charity,

00:28:54.604 --> 00:28:58.729
that is just to have a big name on the television,

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:04.636
or to have a very great advertisement about, “Oh, him!”

00:29:04.839 --> 00:29:07.961
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:13.022
Wee part of it they will donate, wee part of their property

00:29:13.737 --> 00:29:16.967
work it out and make such a fuss about it,

00:29:17.248 --> 00:29:20.061
because they want to cash everything…

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.636
Cash has been given so cash they will...

00:29:23.603 --> 00:29:25.763
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:26.981 --> 00:29:30.486
You have to send waves of emotional intelligence.

00:29:30.984 --> 00:29:35.102
You have to send love to all over the world.

00:29:35.714 --> 00:29:39.832
You have to show how you can, with love, win over.

00:29:40.503 --> 00:29:44.491
It is also possible, if you are not so attached.

00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:48.255
If you are attached, say to your country only—

00:29:48.552 --> 00:29:50.232
now this is a bigger issue —

00:29:50.453 --> 00:29:54.342
then you will try to exploit other countries,

00:29:54.639 --> 00:29:58.035
take advantage of them, try to run them down.

00:29:58.308 --> 00:30:01.077
But if you are emotionally attached to your country,

00:30:01.302 --> 00:30:05.744
then you’ll bring good name to your country by doing real good work.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.770
I don’t know why people do not know how to discriminate.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.657
Why are they so selfish, trying to bring them up,

00:30:14.901 --> 00:30:19.958
trying to do all the good things for themselves?

00:30:23.468 --> 00:30:26.822
There is a very great chance for all of you

00:30:27.753 --> 00:30:30.586
to get this within your reach,

00:30:30.724 --> 00:30:32.917
because you are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:33.284 --> 00:30:35.397
You have become like lotuses.

00:30:35.707 --> 00:30:39.516
And the lotus has the fragrance which spreads all over

00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:44.462
and, days together it stays in the water, in that dirty water,

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.570
and it spreads the fragrance.

00:30:47.866 --> 00:30:51.004
With that fragrance also, you can do lots of things,

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:55.344
that the bees come there, they sleep in that

00:30:56.253 --> 00:30:59.101
beautiful house of the lotus

00:30:59.555 --> 00:31:03.414
and in the night it closes down very carefully.

00:31:03.745 --> 00:31:06.630
All kinds of things that come for the flower

00:31:11.025 --> 00:31:22.844
to take the little of that beauty

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.831
of that flower,

00:31:25.158 --> 00:31:29.032
we can say, because you can extract also

00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:31.813
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

00:31:32.447 --> 00:31:36.595
You can also get some honey out of that.

00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:40.720
Whatever is possible, everybody comes to that flower.

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:45.096
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way is weak,

00:31:45.268 --> 00:31:49.379
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.397
That’s what you are. You are all made into lotuses.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.356
You are not made into some sort of creeps

00:32:00.515 --> 00:32:05.426
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:12.109
You are the people who are to give fragrance of your love,

00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:15.859
fragrance of your compassion to others.

00:32:16.054 --> 00:32:18.015
And you should feel happy about it.

00:32:18.787 --> 00:32:20.900
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,

00:32:21.008 --> 00:32:22.797
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

00:32:23.215 --> 00:32:25.508
But it means that, whatever you have,

00:32:25.681 --> 00:32:28.097
whatever is your possibility, capability,

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.474
you must try to do for others, giving to them.

00:32:33.583 --> 00:32:36.337
And the more you do it, it's collectivity……

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:40.463
That’s what is very important, at least for America,

00:32:40.672 --> 00:32:43.860
because everybody is trying to follow America,

00:32:44.933 --> 00:32:48.013
money-making business, this business, that thing.

00:32:49.813 --> 00:32:51.651
But you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.825
so what you have to do is take

00:32:56.058 --> 00:33:01.430
advantage of your achievement and give this to others,

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.909
give Realisation to others. Many people who get Realisation

00:33:06.182 --> 00:33:08.390
don’t even bother about it.

00:33:09.226 --> 00:33:11.937
They just don’t go and spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:12.478 --> 00:33:14.439
They are not bothered about it.

00:33:14.771 --> 00:33:17.173
Which is sometimes very shocking to Me,

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.335
because what was the need for Me

00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:23.347
to go around the whole world with all the mad people living,

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:25.884
and talking to them about Sahaja Yoga?

00:33:26.858 --> 00:33:29.446
In the same way, you should also feel now

00:33:29.663 --> 00:33:32.412
that: “We have to do this work, we have to change the world.

00:33:32.672 --> 00:33:34.704
We have to get them into Sahaja Yoga.”

00:33:34.849 --> 00:33:37.033
Why can’t we? We are so many people.

00:33:37.178 --> 00:33:39.233
Christ had only twelve disciples,

00:33:39.377 --> 00:33:41.751
and how much they spread Christianity!

00:33:42.738 --> 00:33:46.754
What about you people? You are so well equipped,

00:33:46.927 --> 00:33:49.004
you have so much of knowledge,

00:33:49.267 --> 00:33:53.512
absolute knowledge and experience.

00:33:54.154 --> 00:33:56.995
So if you have the experience and the knowledge,

00:33:57.341 --> 00:33:59.541
you can capture the people.

00:34:00.189 --> 00:34:03.666
But there is some sort of a lurking ambition,

00:34:05.382 --> 00:34:09.493
which goes against, against the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.835
You want to be leader,

00:34:11.922 --> 00:34:13.726
or you want to put down somebody,

00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:16.668
or you think no end of yourself. That’s no good.

00:34:16.783 --> 00:34:20.151
And also they do Sahaja Yoga or spread Sahaja Yoga

00:34:20.259 --> 00:34:22.193
because they want to enhance themselves.

00:34:25.234 --> 00:34:29.686
This is not the way. The way is a complete surrendering,

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.066
complete surrender to the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:38.645
It’s possible, it’s not difficult at all, as I’m telling you.

00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:40.620
It’s very, very simple.

00:34:40.793 --> 00:34:43.040
Only thing, you should understand

00:34:43.163 --> 00:34:48.083
that you have a special place in the whole universe today.

00:34:50.086 --> 00:34:52.149
You are not to rot.

00:34:52.848 --> 00:34:55.178
You are not to waste your life.

00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:59.064
We have started marriages,

00:34:59.317 --> 00:35:02.397
and in America also they said.
I said: “Alright, we’ll have marriages.”

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.830
But these marriages, what is the outcome?

00:35:06.074 --> 00:35:09.234
If they are like all other ordinary marriages, what’s the use?

00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:12.318
What are they doing for others?

00:35:12.572 --> 00:35:14.958
What sort of children they are producing?

00:35:15.248 --> 00:35:17.064
You have to see to it

00:35:17.312 --> 00:35:21.774
that you become married couples in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:26.073
Your family should be a different type,

00:35:26.692 --> 00:35:29.729
your love for your family should be of a different type.

00:35:30.434 --> 00:35:33.709
The whole family of Sahaja Yoga also needs your family.

00:35:34.195 --> 00:35:38.098
So, for everyone, you must have compassion and love.

00:35:39.092 --> 00:35:41.249
I know some people grow very fast,

00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:44.436
but some don’t, because they lack this

00:35:44.746 --> 00:35:48.094
balance between emotion and intelligence.

00:35:48.569 --> 00:35:52.456
This balance has to be completely established.

00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:57.490
And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people,

00:35:57.756 --> 00:36:02.819
so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:03.223 --> 00:36:06.583
So far, whatever was wrong was adopted:

00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:10.644
drug addiction starts, then another thing starts.

00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:16.138
All kinds of nonsensical things started in this country.
Why?

00:36:18.455 --> 00:36:22.550
Now, the new lotuses that are there,

00:36:22.853 --> 00:36:26.068
they have to change the atmosphere of this lake,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.380
where all kinds of dirty things are coming up,

00:36:29.755 --> 00:36:33.476
immoral things are coming up, ruining the whole world.

00:36:34.124 --> 00:36:36.850
So, in our general attitude also,

00:36:38.004 --> 00:36:41.733
we should try to see: “Are we really following?

00:36:42.237 --> 00:36:44.797
Are we really doing what is to be done?

00:36:45.006 --> 00:36:47.401
What are we doing for morality?”

00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:51.403
That’s a very important point in Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:52.111 --> 00:36:55.550
how you dress, how you walk, how you talk,

00:36:55.832 --> 00:36:57.922
everything’s very important,

00:36:58.442 --> 00:37:01.896
and all other things that you have, you should try.

00:37:02.402 --> 00:37:08.214
How to create, and all these things of different, different Chakras,

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:11.040
you should try to concentrate on them

00:37:11.213 --> 00:37:13.593
and see for yourself what are you doing?

00:37:15.223 --> 00:37:17.797
What are you making out of your life?

00:37:18.164 --> 00:37:21.144
You are Sahaja Yogis. You are special people.

00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:24.209
You are not ordinary. I want to tell you

00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:27.807
that you should have self-esteem. Try to understand

00:37:28.925 --> 00:37:31.536
what is your quality, what are you.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.762
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!
