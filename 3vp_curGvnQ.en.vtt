00:04.341 --> 00:12.338
Adi Shakti Puja. Nirmal Nagari, Canajoharie, NY (USA),
2 July 2000.

00:13.128 --> 00:18.320
Today we have come here to do the Adi Shakti Puja.

00:20.651 --> 00:28.064
I have already told you about the Adi Shakti,  how

00:30.485 --> 00:36.236
She had to work out so many things in this world —

00:38.128 --> 00:43.663
first to create and then

00:46.084 --> 00:50.023
to create human beings through evolutionary process.

00:51.380 --> 00:55.566
After that, to comfort.

00:58.661 --> 01:04.456
Then to counsel.

01:05.794 --> 01:12.273
So many people here came on this Earth just to do the counselling.

01:14.011 --> 01:17.875
They told what was wrong, what was right,

01:18.403 --> 01:21.943
what should we do, what we should not do,

01:22.550 --> 01:29.443
what is self-respect and what is the

01:32.514 --> 01:38.979
duty of a human being as a superior-most creature.

01:40.072 --> 01:41.976
So many of Them came on this Earth.

01:42.865 --> 01:46.677
One after another, in every country, They came

01:47.760 --> 01:52.898
and Their counselling formed religions.

01:53.542 --> 01:56.544
Of course, you see the mess of the religions

01:56.785 --> 01:59.697
and that’s how Their life was wasted,

02:00.369 --> 02:06.466
that They formed religions after religions,

02:09.121 --> 02:13.744
by which only human beings were divided,

02:16.465 --> 02:20.983
divided to such an extent they hate each other.

02:22.139 --> 02:26.519
Hateful, somebody’s born in an X religion,

02:27.351 --> 02:31.755
he hates the person who follows the Y religion.

02:32.728 --> 02:35.785
While Those who came as counsellors

02:36.762 --> 02:39.955
talked about complete unity,

02:40.896 --> 02:43.777
complete oneness of human race,

02:44.089 --> 02:50.339
despite that, human brain, in its freedom,

02:50.992 --> 02:54.605
did all kinds of wrong things

02:55.211 --> 03:00.062
and created a country or,

03:00.256 --> 03:06.626
you can say the whole world, full of lots of problems

03:06.992 --> 03:10.407
arising out of religion.

03:11.443 --> 03:18.002
How can it be that religion makes you hate somebody?

03:19.729 --> 03:23.509
Religion is there to understand love,

03:23.901 --> 03:26.877
imbibe love and compassion.

03:29.817 --> 03:37.706
So the third thing one had to do is the Adi Shakti’s job,

03:39.091 --> 03:42.585
that is the one Kundalini within us.

03:44.327 --> 03:51.679
And, by the awakening, we got pure knowledge, absolute knowledge,

03:52.821 --> 03:57.521
pure knowledge that it cannot be challenged.

03:58.419 --> 04:00.802
Absolute it is!

04:01.718 --> 04:06.077
Whatever you know after Realization is absolute.

04:08.256 --> 04:13.197
If you know that, then what you have to understand,

04:13.788 --> 04:19.409
that everything has to be united.

04:21.206 --> 04:27.607
You cannot have fights and you cannot hate anyone.

04:28.796 --> 04:31.835
If that thing starts happening,

04:33.116 --> 04:37.063
all the problems of the world will be finished.

04:37.556 --> 04:40.344
So the first thing, redemption,

04:40.743 --> 04:44.092
that is the quality of the Adi Shakti,

04:44.905 --> 04:52.074
was to redeem people of their all wrong ideas about others.

04:53.517 --> 04:58.209
Firstly, as we know, there are six enemies we have got.

04:59.745 --> 05:05.400
And unless and until we can conquer those six enemies,

05:05.832 --> 05:09.627
we cannot be a religious person. That is what is said,

05:09.992 --> 05:14.073
but actually the all religions are based only

05:14.284 --> 05:19.153
on prospering those six enemies that we have within ourselves.

05:21.836 --> 05:24.824
When you see this clearly, you start seeking,

05:25.134 --> 05:28.046
you start seeking, seeking

05:30.007 --> 05:34.215
earnest, the Truth.

05:37.009 --> 05:39.154
And the revelation of truth,

05:39.575 --> 05:44.744
absolute truth, can only come through your evolution,

05:44.904 --> 05:46.877
through your reformation

05:47.203 --> 05:53.833
that you become person who knows the Truth.

05:54.630 --> 05:59.538
For that, Adi Shakti’s ascent is important within you,

05:59.610 --> 06:01.491
which is your Kundalini.

06:02.314 --> 06:05.607
And when this thing takes place,

06:06.803 --> 06:11.239
automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have.

06:13.285 --> 06:18.987
You become a beautiful human being.

06:19.800 --> 06:25.794
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state,

06:26.521 --> 06:30.822
it looks like all other small

06:34.235 --> 06:38.537
animals, or small, you can say, very, very,

06:38.764 --> 06:41.382
small dirty things that are in the pond.

06:43.793 --> 06:46.574
And then, once it starts coming out,

06:47.471 --> 06:54.525
coming out of that horrible water,

06:55.806 --> 06:58.982
it becomes such a beautiful flower,

06:59.692 --> 07:05.078
rises up and opens out.
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi,

07:05.562 --> 07:11.720
though he lives along with all these horrible things
that are going on,

07:12.873 --> 07:16.359
but flowers like a lotus.

07:17.569 --> 07:19.897
It doesn’t have all these insects,

07:20.279 --> 07:25.082
all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives.

07:26.681 --> 07:30.232
It sucks only the pure water

07:30.821 --> 07:35.776
and the remnant, the others remain there as it is.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.250
So what is left within you

07:39.695 --> 07:45.048
is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance,

07:46.315 --> 07:49.140
just like a lotus.

07:50.755 --> 07:56.887
Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked

07:57.570 --> 08:02.209
by all of these small, small creatures in the water

08:02.848 --> 08:06.181
or all the dirty things that are in the water.

08:09.553 --> 08:13.151
And this state that you have achieved now,

08:13.923 --> 08:18.544
I’m very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it.

08:19.952 --> 08:22.302
You see, it’s a very great blessing,

08:22.917 --> 08:28.476
because America is the leading country in so many ways.

08:29.543 --> 08:33.798
One can say that it has made lots of money.

08:35.064 --> 08:40.893
That is not the criteria of becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.573
What you get is the satisfaction,

08:46.514 --> 08:54.359
satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have
and whatever others have.

08:56.405 --> 08:59.431
And the second thing that happens to you,

08:59.542 --> 09:02.145
you become absolutely collective.

09:02.982 --> 09:05.180
This has to happen.

09:06.153 --> 09:12.099
But I find still people have not understood
the meaning of collectivity.

09:12.938 --> 09:18.503
For example, family is very, very weak here.

09:19.681 --> 09:27.401
Family that has been created by natural relationships

09:28.027 --> 09:31.836
is not so much respected as it should have.

09:32.983 --> 09:37.587
It’s all because, based on money, so people start

09:39.869 --> 09:43.915
quarrelling, fighting and even killing each other.

09:46.756 --> 09:52.503
Now the basis of family is love and compassion.

09:53.247 --> 09:57.322
Those who do not have this cannot have good families.

09:58.496 --> 10:01.627
I’ve seen even among Sahaja Yogis sometimes,

10:01.957 --> 10:05.615
some people who are working for money,

10:06.494 --> 10:11.802
who are educated, sometimes look down upon people

10:12.444 --> 10:14.578
who are not so well off.

10:14.817 --> 10:18.660
Or maybe the housewives who are working in the house,

10:18.999 --> 10:22.836
looking after the children, building up the families

10:22.994 --> 10:29.517
are not treated with respect as some secretary in the

10:30.210 --> 10:33.153
some organization.

10:34.744 --> 10:38.847
I don’t know why this kind of a manliness comes into women.

10:39.770 --> 10:43.044
Why should they think they are something higher

10:43.224 --> 10:45.770
than the women who are working hard

10:45.914 --> 10:50.566
in the household, cooking, looking after children,

10:51.092 --> 10:55.910
bearing all the brunt of the society.

10:57.482 --> 11:03.172
This is something, I feel, is a part which is lacking very much

11:03.467 --> 11:07.333
in America and also Western countries.

11:08.313 --> 11:10.873
When money becomes important,

11:11.566 --> 11:13.981
if when money is important,

11:14.277 --> 11:20.306
then the Lakshmi principle is not respected.

11:21.019 --> 11:22.338
Very surprising.

11:22.447 --> 11:26.119
Money is the part which is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

11:26.667 --> 11:28.547
but the Gruha Lakshmi is the one

11:28.663 --> 11:31.975
who is a householder, is not respected.

11:33.186 --> 11:35.681
And with this, I tell you,

11:36.315 --> 11:40.679
there’s a… very, very wrong things can happen.

11:41.646 --> 11:45.423
You can work, you can be educated,

11:45.783 --> 11:49.678
but you should be able to look after your family

11:50.054 --> 11:55.304
and look after their comfort and look after their unity.

11:56.651 --> 12:00.035
Instead of that, educated women,

12:00.258 --> 12:03.258
I call them manly women,

12:03.561 --> 12:08.213
educated women think that they are something higher,
they are sadly mistaken.

12:09.359 --> 12:12.698
In no way, a man is higher than a woman.

12:13.752 --> 12:16.772
So this kind of a disparity that exists

12:17.343 --> 12:20.739
and one starts thinking that: “We are earning.

12:20.919 --> 12:22.887
We are educated”

12:23.306 --> 12:26.355
are really manly women, I must say.

12:27.193 --> 12:31.470
But the women who work very hard in a household with love,

12:32.565 --> 12:36.496
look after the children, look after the family,

12:36.813 --> 12:41.393
are in no way less than these people who are working in the office.

12:42.597 --> 12:45.359
So, such women must be respected

12:45.964 --> 12:49.267
by their husbands, by the men,

12:49.592 --> 12:51.899
members  of the family — not only that,

12:52.166 --> 12:55.310
but all the Sahaja Yogis must respect such women,

12:55.484 --> 12:58.866
who are doing such a difficult task.

12:59.731 --> 13:03.013
I’ve been a housewife and I know what it is

13:04.038 --> 13:07.534
to run the house, to look after the children,

13:07.831 --> 13:11.940
to look after the complete organization

13:12.388 --> 13:16.261
and looking after the expenditure

13:17.162 --> 13:19.593
of the money, if that is limited.

13:20.998 --> 13:24.374
This ego has to go.

13:25.671 --> 13:29.818
The other day, one lady, she came in interview and asked Me

13:30.034 --> 13:35.761
that: “How is it, in this world of men, you are so much respected?”

13:37.383 --> 13:41.458
World of men —I was really laughing.

13:41.826 --> 13:46.059
What makes her think that is the world of men, I can’t understand.

13:46.319 --> 13:48.979
Can they exist without women?”

13:49.491 --> 13:54.273
But I was amazed at her question because she said

13:54.414 --> 13:59.321
that: “Even in the jail, criminals are so much respectful,

13:59.804 --> 14:01.491
how is it possible?

14:01.686 --> 14:05.523
How can they have so much respect for a women?”

14:06.316 --> 14:10.080
I said: “I can’t understand one thing,

14:10.260 --> 14:14.068
that criminals have got mothers or not?”

14:16.361 --> 14:19.318
They are all males, don’t they have a mother?

14:19.794 --> 14:24.770
They all have a mother and they respect the mother.

14:25.997 --> 14:28.044
That’s the point one should know,

14:28.319 --> 14:32.437
that woman is a much more important thing

14:32.731 --> 14:37.189
than the man is, as far as the children are concerned.

14:38.674 --> 14:42.482
But I’ve seen even some ladies,

14:42.603 --> 14:46.204
who think they are very capable, try to control everything

14:46.911 --> 14:48.785
and create problems.

14:50.326 --> 14:53.414
And mother’s job is not to control.

14:54.163 --> 14:57.590
Her job is to love, to give compassion

14:57.814 --> 15:01.275
and this is the quality of women is lost

15:01.491 --> 15:04.434
in these Western, so-called advanced,

15:05.855 --> 15:09.201
It is a very dangerous thing. I personally think

15:09.511 --> 15:14.177
that, if such a thing happens, families will be destroyed.

15:14.437 --> 15:19.752
Nobody will have respect for the lady who looks after the family.

15:20.378 --> 15:24.633
And she is more than a prime minister, I would say, in a family

15:25.088 --> 15:28.427
and she’s to be respected and to be understood.

15:30.013 --> 15:33.662
Today, I think it is important to say

15:34.103 --> 15:38.559
that all of you should understand the value of women

15:38.861 --> 15:40.829
who are housewives.

15:42.950 --> 15:44.644
It’s a tremendous job

15:44.746 --> 15:48.021
to be a housewife. I have gone through it and I know what it is.

15:50.321 --> 15:53.465
If the respect for the housewife is not given…

15:54.597 --> 15:59.292
She will also look after the children.

16:00.641 --> 16:02.948
Children are tomorrow’s citizens.

16:03.331 --> 16:06.901
Who will groom them? Who will bring them up?

16:07.996 --> 16:11.415
All those manly women don’t also have children sometimes,

16:11.906 --> 16:14.588
so they don’t know what is the problem of children.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.915
At least those who are solving the problem of their children,

16:19.001 --> 16:22.334
you must understand their responsibility.

16:23.682 --> 16:28.132
This is a very, very crucial point, I think on which

16:28.439 --> 16:31.627
all the Western societies are collapsing,

16:31.757 --> 16:35.442
because in their culture there is no place for the mother.

16:39.544 --> 16:42.429
So, the women should not feel in any way less

16:42.624 --> 16:45.437
if they are mothers and looking after the household.

16:45.632 --> 16:48.169
They should not feel inferior to anybody

16:48.285 --> 16:51.660
who thinks that they are something great.

16:53.384 --> 16:56.896
Basically, the families have to be good.

16:57.689 --> 17:01.028
This collectivity must work first in the family.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.454
The children are to be groomed properly.

17:04.887 --> 17:07.410
They are to be brought up in a proper way.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.677
As it is, in these days, you know what is happening to the children.

17:11.197 --> 17:15.069
When I read about it, I’m really shocked that

17:16.195 --> 17:20.824
children are just treated as if they’re some unwanted stuff.

17:21.952 --> 17:24.470
They are not given any attention.

17:25.068 --> 17:29.835
Ultimately, the children become drug addicts,

17:30.196 --> 17:33.628
they become vagabonds or anything. They can become anything,

17:33.802 --> 17:37.205
because there’s so much, so much neglect

17:37.422 --> 17:40.494
and so much of hatred for children.

17:42.185 --> 17:46.649
So one has to first remember that, for collectivity,

17:46.780 --> 17:50.918
you must look after your children.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.366
Not only that, with love and compassion,

17:58.584 --> 18:04.915
not as somebody who is trying to become a despot out of it,

18:05.348 --> 18:09.770
but a person who is a source,

18:10.123 --> 18:13.700
who is a source of joy and compassion.

18:15.264 --> 18:19.101
In one of My lectures, I talked to you about

18:19.245 --> 18:22.671
the emotional intelligence.

18:25.699 --> 18:28.382
That is what we should try to imbibe.

18:29.097 --> 18:32.774
Emotional intelligence, that means

18:32.940 --> 18:37.065
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

18:39.401 --> 18:42.798
Unless and until we become emotionally intelligent,

18:42.935 --> 18:44.991
our society cannot work.

18:46.180 --> 18:50.212
In an emotional intelligence, you care

18:50.981 --> 18:53.308
and you enjoy caring.

18:54.232 --> 18:59.043
You do everything for others

18:59.859 --> 19:03.341
with a great emotional understanding.

19:03.515 --> 19:06.484
Not for one child, not for one son,

19:06.680 --> 19:12.298
but for everyone you have to be emotionally intelligent.

19:13.761 --> 19:17.411
Some children are born like this, but some are to be made like that,

19:17.901 --> 19:21.197
that they should be emotionally intelligent.

19:22.873 --> 19:28.030
Because, if the mother and father are money-oriented,

19:28.672 --> 19:33.402
very selfish, they wouldn’t allow their child

19:33.670 --> 19:36.092
to give anything to others.

19:36.706 --> 19:41.429
So such a child will grow into a very funny type of a person

19:42.144 --> 19:46.953
and will never do anything for anybody not even for his own country.

19:47.278 --> 19:51.215
Why should he? Everything for selfishness.

19:52.289 --> 19:55.672
Then such people indulge into corruption,

19:56.112 --> 19:58.758
indulge into all kinds of things,

19:58.953 --> 20:02.970
which are only selfish in attitude.

20:04.462 --> 20:07.117
Now we are talking of collectivity.

20:07.816 --> 20:11.104
In collectivity, we do for others.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.450
We enjoy doing for others.

20:15.237 --> 20:19.231
We love giving things to others, not for yourself,

20:19.426 --> 20:22.953
because your children will also become the same kind

20:23.148 --> 20:25.636
and they will only bother about themselves.

20:28.312 --> 20:32.912
This emotional intelligence has to be brought in our life.

20:33.497 --> 20:38.147
In our pattern that we have, are we emotionally

20:38.956 --> 20:45.114
intelligent or we are just intelligent or emotional?

20:46.008 --> 20:47.608
Both things are wrong.

20:47.897 --> 20:51.381
If you are just intelligent, you can become very dry person.

20:52.384 --> 20:57.590
You may just have few friends maybe, you may not have

20:58.340 --> 21:02.190
and you will always try to preserve yourself away

21:02.804 --> 21:04.925
from the collectivity.

21:05.803 --> 21:09.922
And if you are emotional, you’ll be attached to only one person,

21:11.458 --> 21:15.446
attached to one child, attached to one person,

21:15.806 --> 21:18.893
to someone, even in the society.

21:19.679 --> 21:23.653
For no rhyme or reason. Why? Why are you attached to one person?

21:25.629 --> 21:28.643
Why you bothered about one person only?

21:29.270 --> 21:32.869
All such people fall into such terrible play.

21:33.287 --> 21:35.471
In the politics you have seen how,

21:35.616 --> 21:37.772
people try to help their own sons

21:37.873 --> 21:40.326
and own daughters and this and that.

21:40.427 --> 21:43.016
And we Indians have suffered a lot with this

21:43.325 --> 21:46.088
kind of an emotional attachment.

21:51.178 --> 21:56.096
So, according to ethics,

21:57.134 --> 22:02.191
emotional intelligence is the highest quality,

22:04.259 --> 22:07.484
by which you give to others,

22:08.590 --> 22:12.701
you care for others, for everyone

22:13.934 --> 22:17.028
and you become very, very collective.

22:20.677 --> 22:24.556
Now exclusiveness is another fashion

22:24.730 --> 22:27.327
that’s very miserable, it’s exclusive.

22:28.069 --> 22:30.914
because you don’t want to be one of the multitudes.

22:31.023 --> 22:33.341
You want to be exclusive.

22:34.318 --> 22:41.926
You should be exclusive in emotional intelligence,
not on other things.

22:42.612 --> 22:45.670
That is the best thing that you can have.

22:46.044 --> 22:50.227
As I agree, I am just a woman and just a mother,

22:51.469 --> 22:57.209
but what I have is really the emotional intelligence,

22:57.627 --> 23:03.988
ocean of it, and from that I know about everyone,

23:05.703 --> 23:07.895
I understand about everyone.

23:08.552 --> 23:13.752
And all this work has been done because of that quality in My head.

23:14.106 --> 23:19.535
I’m not attached to one person or to one style.

23:20.090 --> 23:24.244
Whatever you say, I can understand,

23:24.410 --> 23:26.125
because I am at a level

23:26.263 --> 23:30.166
where I can understand everything that you are doing.

23:31.146 --> 23:36.396
To achieve that, you try to develop emotional intelligence.

23:37.246 --> 23:41.624
Here the children won’t even give a toy to somebody to play with.

23:43.852 --> 23:48.503
Even the mother is like that, the father is like that,
extremely selfish

23:49.290 --> 23:53.528
and: “We must have our own, you see, everything should be our own.”

23:54.631 --> 24:00.378
This has to go. This has to go, from Americans especially, because

24:00.515 --> 24:05.796
they are the leading nation in this kind of selfishness.

24:08.377 --> 24:12.048
What selfishness they have done, I need not count,
but you know that.

24:12.791 --> 24:15.956
You go and ask the people of Canada, Mexico,

24:16.165 --> 24:18.502
Peru, all this, they will tell you.

24:19.396 --> 24:22.317
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.922
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

24:28.475 --> 24:33.769
Nobody can even tell them,
because they think they are very rich people.

24:35.052 --> 24:40.115
But all these riches will not give them the joy of life.

24:41.586 --> 24:46.974
Joy of life is only in the emotional intelligence.

24:47.759 --> 24:51.170
If you don’t have that, it becomes very dry.

24:51.372 --> 24:54.949
Life becomes very odd, unbearable, horrible

24:55.368 --> 24:59.954
and even the family gets broken,

25:00.805 --> 25:03.833
if there is no emotional intelligence in the family.

25:04.883 --> 25:07.075
I have known so many women

25:07.559 --> 25:10.004
who have had three marriages, five marriages.

25:10.105 --> 25:11.728
I don’t know how they can do it.

25:11.965 --> 25:16.120
But they’ve done because of this lack of emotional intelligence.

25:17.705 --> 25:22.307
It is something that is a sense of giving.

25:23.490 --> 25:27.175
It's not that your sacrifising anything, no.

25:27.421 --> 25:29.050
That’s also another idea,

25:29.187 --> 25:32.223
that we are to bear this —nothing of the kind.

25:33.586 --> 25:36.470
Look at the life of Christ, He gave His life.

25:37.220 --> 25:39.650
Why? What was the need for Him to do that?

25:40.531 --> 25:42.802
Behind Him was the Truth.

25:43.617 --> 25:46.819
When you have the Truth with you, the light of the Truth,

25:46.931 --> 25:49.834
the force of the Truth, the strength of the Truth,

25:50.166 --> 25:53.466
you become emotionally intelligent.

25:55.043 --> 25:58.586
You understand that, if you really love something,

25:58.752 --> 26:04.492
then you have to undergo every kind of trouble.

26:04.948 --> 26:07.304
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

26:07.479 --> 26:09.287
I know it’s too much to say,

26:09.431 --> 26:15.804
but I thought that, for this special Puja, I should say something

26:15.963 --> 26:17.766
about the family life.

26:18.330 --> 26:22.462
In our ashrams or in our programs

26:22.650 --> 26:26.911
or wherever we are, we should remember this point,

26:27.207 --> 26:32.918
that: “Are we having that emotional intelligence

26:33.055 --> 26:35.623
when we are trying to talk among Sahaja Yoga?”

26:37.476 --> 26:41.724
Why do I need to be every place to tell them? What is the need?

26:42.264 --> 26:43.836
You can tell them.

26:44.226 --> 26:47.378
If you have that emotional intelligence,

26:47.724 --> 26:50.550
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

26:50.814 --> 26:53.338
Not necessary I should go everywhere

26:53.472 --> 26:56.257
and talk to them. How many countries can I do?

26:57.151 --> 26:59.696
And the reaction to it is so beautiful

26:59.927 --> 27:03.043
and so nice. It’s very surprising.

27:03.259 --> 27:07.218
Like in a country like Benin country, all Muslims there,

27:07.536 --> 27:12.424
all black people, they all have become Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand.

27:14.379 --> 27:16.524
How could I capture that?

27:17.026 --> 27:21.106
Just think of that. Nine thousand people come to you!

27:21.718 --> 27:24.754
Then also other countries I have seen.

27:25.352 --> 27:29.204
Just this is the power of emotional intelligence

27:29.333 --> 27:31.850
that captures the heart of the people.

27:33.156 --> 27:37.790
You may have any amount of property, money, everything,

27:37.978 --> 27:40.992
people will abhor you. Alright.

27:41.649 --> 27:44.252
So you may say: “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with this?”

27:44.597 --> 27:52.978
That you are harming the greatest thing, is the human being.

27:54.811 --> 27:58.113
And the politicians they are horrible, as they say.

27:58.748 --> 28:01.957
Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence.

28:03.082 --> 28:09.782
Also as administrators, they are very much difficult,

28:09.876 --> 28:12.133
because they have no emotional intelligence.

28:14.331 --> 28:19.135
All these people are devoid of that great quality

28:19.416 --> 28:21.385
of emotional intelligence.

28:22.467 --> 28:24.904
If your country is very progressive,

28:25.048 --> 28:28.633
I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence.

28:29.488 --> 28:31.897
That way, they have philanthropists, I know.

28:32.383 --> 28:34.719
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

28:35.066 --> 28:38.815
But behind that is they want to have power.

28:41.815 --> 28:44.252
They want to rule people with that money.

28:45.586 --> 28:50.246
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they just want to rule.

28:50.671 --> 28:54.024
If they start some sort of a charity,

28:54.543 --> 28:58.668
that is just to have a big name on the television,

28:58.906 --> 29:04.575
or to have a very great advertisement about, “Oh, him!”

29:04.778 --> 29:07.900
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.961
We part of their  [UNCLEAR]   we part of their property

29:13.676 --> 29:16.906
work it out and make such a fuss about it,

29:17.187 --> 29:20.000
because they want to cash everything…

29:20.209 --> 29:22.575
Cash has been lots of cashed  in

29:23.542 --> 29:25.702
You are Sahaja Yogis.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.425
You have to send waves of emotional intelligence.

29:30.923 --> 29:35.041
You have to send love to all over the world.

29:35.653 --> 29:39.771
You have to show how you can, with love, win over.

29:40.442 --> 29:44.430
It is also possible, if you are not so attached.

29:44.898 --> 29:48.194
If you are attached, say to your country only—

29:48.491 --> 29:50.171
now this is a bigger issue —

29:50.392 --> 29:54.281
then you will try to exploit other countries,

29:54.578 --> 29:57.974
take advantage of them, try to run them down.

29:58.247 --> 30:01.016
But if you are emotionally attached to your country,

30:01.241 --> 30:05.683
then you’ll bring good name to your country by doing real good work.

30:07.009 --> 30:10.709
I don’t know why people do not know how to discriminate.

30:11.459 --> 30:14.596
Why are they so selfish, trying to bring them up,

30:14.840 --> 30:19.897
trying to do all the good things for themselves?

30:23.407 --> 30:26.761
There is a very great chance for all of you

30:27.692 --> 30:30.525
to get this within your reach,

30:30.663 --> 30:32.856
because you are all Sahaja Yogis.

30:33.223 --> 30:35.336
You have become like lotuses.

30:35.646 --> 30:39.455
And the lotus has the fragrance which spreads all over

30:40.426 --> 30:44.401
and, days together it stays in the water, in that dirty water,

30:44.689 --> 30:47.509
and it spreads the fragrance.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.943
With that fragrance also, you can do lots of things,

30:51.208 --> 30:55.283
that the bees come there, they sleep in that

30:56.192 --> 30:59.040
beautiful house of the lotus

30:59.494 --> 31:03.353
and in the night it closes down very carefully.

31:03.684 --> 31:06.569
All kinds of things that come from the flower

31:10.964 --> 31:22.783
to take the beauty

31:23.339 --> 31:24.770
of that flower,

31:25.097 --> 31:28.971
we can say, because you can extract also

31:29.112 --> 31:31.752
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

31:32.386 --> 31:36.534
You can also get some honey out of that.

31:36.764 --> 31:40.659
Whatever is possible, everybody comes to that flower.

31:41.558 --> 31:45.035
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way is weak,

31:45.207 --> 31:49.318
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

31:52.499 --> 31:56.336
That’s what you are. You are all made into lotuses.

31:57.289 --> 32:00.295
You are not made into some sort of creeps

32:00.454 --> 32:05.365
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

32:06.718 --> 32:12.048
You are the people who are to give fragrance of your love,

32:12.308 --> 32:15.798
fragrance of your compassion to others.

32:15.993 --> 32:17.954
And you should feel happy about it.

32:18.726 --> 32:20.839
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,

32:20.947 --> 32:22.736
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

32:23.154 --> 32:25.447
But it means that, whatever you have,

32:25.620 --> 32:28.036
whatever is your possibility, capability,

32:28.209 --> 32:32.413
you must try to do for others, give it to them.

32:33.522 --> 32:36.276
And the more you do in this collectivity…

32:36.493 --> 32:40.402
That’s what is very important, at least for America,

32:40.611 --> 32:43.799
because everybody is trying to follow America,

32:44.872 --> 32:47.952
money-making business, this business, that thing.

32:49.752 --> 32:51.590
But you are all Sahaja Yogis,

32:51.799 --> 32:54.764
so what you have to do is take

32:55.997 --> 33:01.369
advantage of your achievement and give this to others,

33:01.759 --> 33:05.848
give Realisation to others. Many people who get Realisation

33:06.121 --> 33:08.329
don’t even bother about it.

33:09.165 --> 33:11.876
They just don’t go and spread Sahaja Yoga.

33:12.417 --> 33:14.378
They are not bothered about it.

33:14.710 --> 33:17.112
Which is sometimes very shocking to Me,

33:17.349 --> 33:19.274
because what was the need for Me

33:19.397 --> 33:23.286
to go around the whole world with all the mad people living,

33:23.473 --> 33:25.823
and talking to them about Sahaja Yoga?

33:26.797 --> 33:29.385
In the same way, you should also feel now

33:29.602 --> 33:32.351
that:  “We have to do this work, we have to change the world.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.643
We have to get them into Sahaja Yoga.”

33:34.788 --> 33:36.972
Why can’t we? We are so many people.

33:37.117 --> 33:39.172
Christ had only twelve disciples,

33:39.316 --> 33:41.690
and how much they spread Christianity!

33:42.677 --> 33:46.693
What about you people? You are so well equipped,

33:46.866 --> 33:48.943
you have so much of knowledge,

33:49.206 --> 33:53.451
absolute knowledge and experience.

33:54.093 --> 33:56.934
So if you have the experience and the knowledge,

33:57.280 --> 33:59.480
you can capture the people.

34:00.128 --> 34:03.605
But there is some sort of a lurking ambition,

34:05.321 --> 34:09.432
which goes against, against the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

34:10.109 --> 34:11.774
You want to be leader,

34:11.861 --> 34:13.665
or you want to put down somebody,

34:13.788 --> 34:16.607
or you think no end of yourself. That’s no good.

34:16.722 --> 34:20.090
And also they do Sahaja Yoga or spread Sahaja Yoga

34:20.198 --> 34:22.132
because they want to enhance themselves.

34:25.173 --> 34:29.625
This is not the way. The way is a complete surrendering,

34:30.299 --> 34:34.005
complete surrender to the work of Sahaja Yoga.

34:34.848 --> 34:38.584
It’s possible, it’s not difficult at all, as I’m telling you.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.559
It’s very, very simple.

34:40.732 --> 34:42.979
Only thing, you should understand

34:43.102 --> 34:48.022
that you have a special place in the whole universe today.

34:50.025 --> 34:52.088
You are not to rot.

34:52.787 --> 34:55.117
You are not to waste your life.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.003
We have started marriages,

34:59.256 --> 35:02.336
and in America also they said.
I said: “Alright, we’ll have marriages.”

35:02.639 --> 35:05.769
But these marriages, what is the outcome?

35:06.013 --> 35:09.173
If they are like all other ordinary marriages, what’s the use?

35:09.748 --> 35:12.257
What are they doing for others?

35:12.511 --> 35:14.897
What sort of children they are producing?

35:15.187 --> 35:17.003
You have to see to it

35:17.251 --> 35:21.713
that you become married couples in Sahaja Yoga.

35:22.131 --> 35:26.012
Your family should be a different type,

35:26.631 --> 35:29.668
your love for your family should be of a different type.

35:30.373 --> 35:33.648
The whole family of Sahaja Yoga also needs your family.

35:34.134 --> 35:38.037
So, for everyone, you must have compassion and love.

35:39.031 --> 35:41.188
I know some people grow very fast,

35:41.310 --> 35:44.375
but some don’t, because they lack this

35:44.685 --> 35:48.033
balance between emotion and intelligence.

35:48.508 --> 35:52.395
This balance has to be completely established.

35:52.611 --> 35:57.429
And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people,

35:57.695 --> 36:02.758
so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.522
So far, whatever was wrong was adopted:

36:07.021 --> 36:10.583
drug addiction starts, then another thing starts.

36:10.828 --> 36:16.077
All kinds of nonsensical things started in this country.
Why?

36:18.394 --> 36:22.489
Now, the new lotuses that are there,

36:22.792 --> 36:26.007
they have to change the atmosphere of this lake,

36:26.119 --> 36:29.319
where all kinds of dirty things are coming up,

36:29.694 --> 36:33.415
immoral things are coming up, ruining the whole world.

36:34.063 --> 36:36.789
So, in our general attitude also,

36:37.943 --> 36:41.672
we should try to see: “Are we really following?

36:42.176 --> 36:44.736
Are we really doing what is to be done?

36:44.945 --> 36:47.340
What are we doing for morality?”

36:48.147 --> 36:51.342
That’s a very important point in Sahaja Yoga,

36:52.050 --> 36:55.489
how you dress, how you walk, how you talk,

36:55.771 --> 36:57.861
everything’s very important,

36:58.381 --> 37:01.835
and all other things that you have, you should try.

37:02.341 --> 37:08.153
How to create, and all these things of different, different Chakras,

37:08.578 --> 37:10.979
you should try to concentrate on them

37:11.152 --> 37:13.532
and see for yourself what are you doing?

37:15.162 --> 37:17.736
What are you making out of your life?

37:18.103 --> 37:21.083
You are Sahaja Yogis. You are special people.

37:21.372 --> 37:24.148
You are not ordinary. I want to tell you

37:24.270 --> 37:27.746
that you should have self-esteem. Try to understand

37:28.864 --> 37:31.475
what is your quality, what are you.

37:32.319 --> 37:35.701
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!
