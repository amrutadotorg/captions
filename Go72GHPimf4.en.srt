1
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:20,065
So now, let’s have it, the second question. Now what is it?

2
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,408
Yogi: Mother, how can we please you best?

3
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:31,198
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Gregoire: How can we please you best?

4
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:38,581
I have no desires.

5
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:42,690
I don’t know

6
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:02,847
You see, inside me is complete peace and complete satisfaction.

7
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,393
There is nothing that is needed inside.

8
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:24,175
But the ripples of that joy flows outward all the time.

9
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:34,237
And when it reaches your shores, you see, it comes back.

10
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:42,237
And it weaves a beautiful pattern,

11
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:49,221
and I see the pattern.

12
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:54,815
The reciprocity, how much you reciprocate,

13
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:02,675
is the way the pattern is beautiful.

14
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:13,722
It’s delicate, it’s powerful.

15
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:19,526
It’s so soothing

16
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:29,442
and it weaves the complete beauty of bhakti.

17
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:45,275
So much so that this ocean of joy itself gets turbulent,

18
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:53,885
and I really swing with it.

19
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:00,690
And it is not easy to describe

20
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:07,942
that beautiful feeling of tremendous joy.

21
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,495
The first thing you have to know

22
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,909
that I love you very much,

23
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:27,042
with all my heart, with all my soul.

24
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,057
In the same way try to love me

25
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,340
with all sincerity and trust.

26
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,684
May God bless you all!
