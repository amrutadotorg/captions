00:41:01.006 --> 00:41:06.910
Today is a very great day for all the sahaja
yogis;

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:18.986
because Sahasrara opened in you, you could
feel the existence of God.

00:41:19.187 --> 00:41:24.990
By saying there is God that was not
sufficient

00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:33.472
and to say there is no God also was wrong,
very wrong

00:41:33.673 --> 00:41:39.880
and people have suffered who have said
like them.

00:41:40.884 --> 00:41:45.412
Only after getting realisation you know

00:41:45.618 --> 00:41:52.547
that there is God and there are vibrations.

00:41:52.748 --> 00:41:59.748
It's a very big opening all over the world.

00:42:00.703 --> 00:42:06.797
Today I say that's why is one of
the greatest day for you.

00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:23.424
Many of you have felt the cool breeze on
your hands and out of your brain.

00:42:24.226 --> 00:42:29.632
Some have grown in Sahaja Yoga, some
have not.

00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:42.392
Some are still carrying on with old
catches.

00:42:46.111 --> 00:42:54.075
But now I have to say that quite a lot of
you can become gurus,

00:42:54.276 --> 00:43:02.124
means teachers, and you should act as
teachers.

00:43:05.693 --> 00:43:14.249
To act as teacher you should know Sahaja
Yoga, the theory and the practice of it,

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:21.354
thoroughly well and then you can become
a guru.

00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:32.324
It's a very responsibility, lot of
understanding for a guru.

00:43:35.674 --> 00:43:40.514
You should not have any ego, first;

00:43:42.245 --> 00:43:48.195
you should not have any of your chakras
catching;

00:43:48.724 --> 00:43:53.221
you should be absolutely clear all the time

00:43:53.428 --> 00:44:00.076
and there the vibrations should be flowing
in both the hands.

00:44:00.277 --> 00:44:06.314
If they are moving in one hand and not in
another you cannot become guru.

00:44:06.515 --> 00:44:17.993
So you have to be a perfect Sahaja Yogi.
Then only you can be a guru,

00:44:19.538 --> 00:44:23.999
and so many of you can be,

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:32.935
but you have to ascertain first: are you
capable of being a guru or not.

00:44:34.187 --> 00:44:38.303
With humbleness you'll understand.

00:44:38.504 --> 00:44:45.116
Those who think they can be guru should
become gurus

00:44:45.317 --> 00:44:51.050
because now I can't travel from places
to places

00:44:51.613 --> 00:44:59.204
and you have to do My job, is to give
realisation to people.

00:44:59.904 --> 00:45:05.424
But you have be able to give en-masse
realisation,

00:45:05.625 --> 00:45:10.130
then only you could be a guru.

00:45:10.354 --> 00:45:19.360
If you can give en-masse realisation then
you could be a guru.

00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:23.409
You can use My photograph

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:31.323
but the realisation should not be from
the photograph,

00:45:32.508 --> 00:45:35.771
but from you.

00:45:38.262 --> 00:45:42.386
Then only you can be a guru.

00:45:45.302 --> 00:45:52.477
There can be ladies or men, both can become
gurus

00:45:52.678 --> 00:45:56.976
and spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:45:58.361 --> 00:46:04.862
In My whole touring business, Canada
I have missed

00:46:05.063 --> 00:46:12.857
and I would request some of you to go to
Canada because it's a very beautiful place

00:46:13.058 --> 00:46:17.802
and we have very beautiful Sahaja Yogis
there.

00:46:18.003 --> 00:46:25.493
You have to do now My work. I won't be able
to go all over,

00:46:25.694 --> 00:46:34.340
but you have to go to other countries and
create new Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:37.469
You can do it.

00:46:37.971 --> 00:46:44.726
To begin with you can use My photograph
but later on

00:46:44.927 --> 00:46:57.563
you can only put the photograph there but
use your own powers and give realisation.

00:46:57.764 --> 00:47:06.506
You can do it, and that is how we can
spread Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

00:47:06.707 --> 00:47:15.193
I have done My level best now but I don't
think now I can travel any more,

00:47:15.394 --> 00:47:25.526
so I'm telling you that you have to take
over and work it out.

00:47:26.137 --> 00:47:31.621
That doesn't mean you cancel Me, no,
not at all.

00:47:31.822 --> 00:47:39.750
I am there with you and every place you
work you put My photograph,

00:47:39.951 --> 00:47:49.199
but realisation you have to give and try
to give mass realisation.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:57.572
If that doesn't work out then you should
know you are not a guru.

00:48:00.414 --> 00:48:07.793
If you can give mass realisation, then only
you are a guru.

00:48:07.994 --> 00:48:11.801
Otherwise you are not.

00:48:12.586 --> 00:48:23.596
I said you can use My photograph but you
have to give realisation to people.

00:48:24.456 --> 00:48:28.432
This is the sign of a guru.

00:48:32.352 --> 00:48:39.672
Then you already know what are different
centres

00:48:39.873 --> 00:48:48.301
and what are the things missing in people.
I've explained very clearly.

00:48:48.502 --> 00:48:54.166
In the same way you'll find those who come
for realisation,

00:48:54.367 --> 00:49:02.296
they'll have some defects and you'll find
out what chakras they are catching.

00:49:02.497 --> 00:49:11.327
You know how to clear those chakras, so you
have to tell them how to clear.

00:49:11.528 --> 00:49:19.063
Now you have mastered Sahaja Yoga so you
should know what is to be done.

00:49:19.264 --> 00:49:27.416
If you think you have mastered, if you
believe that you have mastered,

00:49:28.293 --> 00:49:32.273
then you can become gurus.

00:49:32.474 --> 00:49:40.347
But first of all, you should ascertain and
find out for yourself

00:49:40.548 --> 00:49:44.803
if you are a guru or not.

00:49:46.454 --> 00:49:52.314
It is your responsibility now to give
realisation to people

00:49:55.429 --> 00:50:08.087
and you can give if you have vibrations
as like a guru.

00:50:09.527 --> 00:50:20.487
Or ladies also, they're called as guruvi,
not as gurus, but as guruvis,

00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:25.056
but they can be called as guru also.

00:50:26.655 --> 00:50:31.075
And they can also do this work very well.

00:50:31.276 --> 00:50:36.452
Solving the problems of people is not
difficult then.

00:50:36.653 --> 00:50:44.210
Once they get realisation, their problems
will be solved.

00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:51.033
This is a big power you have got, you all
should use.

00:50:51.234 --> 00:50:56.691
First of all, you can use a group if you
want

00:50:56.895 --> 00:51:02.611
and afterwards, you should do it
individually.

00:51:02.812 --> 00:51:07.782
Can you imagine all of you, if you become
gurus,

00:51:07.983 --> 00:51:13.301
how many Sahaja Yogis we'll have all over
the world?

00:51:19.424 --> 00:51:25.015
Whatever you teach, you must practice.

00:51:25.216 --> 00:51:30.034
When a person who drinks, cannot become
a guru.

00:51:30.235 --> 00:51:38.142
A person who flirts and has a licentious
life, cannot become a guru.

00:51:38.343 --> 00:51:45.737
So first examine yourself: are you clean
or not?

00:51:48.016 --> 00:51:54.631
If there are many possessed people who try
to become gurus, they cannot.

00:51:54.832 --> 00:52:02.322
Honestly you should see on the photograph
if you are possessed,

00:52:02.679 --> 00:52:09.895
then you cannot be guru. So now to become
a guru is first to criticise yourself,

00:52:10.096 --> 00:52:16.985
to find out yourself fully, and then you
can become a guru.

00:52:17.186 --> 00:52:25.945
I don't want to tell anybody individually
but you all can find out.

00:52:26.146 --> 00:52:31.384
Say four-five people can join together

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:40.121
and they can find out from each other if
they are all right or not,

00:52:40.322 --> 00:52:45.540
if there is missing, if they are catching.

00:52:45.857 --> 00:52:51.801
But if they say there you are alright then
you can become gurus

00:52:52.002 --> 00:53:00.590
and you can preach Sahaja Yoga. This is
your responsibility.

00:53:00.791 --> 00:53:04.432
This is how Sahaja Yoga will grow.

00:53:04.633 --> 00:53:14.014
Otherwise, after I'll retire or I'll don't
go anywhere,

00:53:14.215 --> 00:53:19.034
then Sahaja Yoga will go into waste.

00:53:21.517 --> 00:53:29.639
So it is for you to carry the torch,
the light.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:39.656
It's your responsibility now. You have got
your realisation.

00:53:42.163 --> 00:53:46.823
I was born with the responsibility,

00:53:47.837 --> 00:53:51.334
I was born with all the understanding.

00:53:51.535 --> 00:53:58.002
And now you are also understanding
yourself.

00:53:58.203 --> 00:54:06.111
Do not condemn yourself, as long as you
start your own realisation,

00:54:06.312 --> 00:54:12.948
but be careful: don't become egoistical.

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:20.405
You have to be very humble, very humble
with everyone.

00:54:20.606 --> 00:54:25.942
And work it out because if they are not
realised souls

00:54:26.143 --> 00:54:33.714
you shouldn't condemn them but tell them
very patiently and sweetly

00:54:33.915 --> 00:54:42.012
that "you are not alright". Tell them how
to meditate, how to improve.

00:54:42.213 --> 00:54:46.931
It's now a very big responsibility.

00:54:47.132 --> 00:54:58.256
Actually, I have done this work and you can
do this work also.

00:54:58.457 --> 00:55:02.415
So you all have to become a guru.

00:55:02.616 --> 00:55:12.438
This is the day of Guru Purnima and I bless
you that you all become gurus.

00:55:12.639 --> 00:55:17.952
Whatever you have got now, don't waste it.

00:55:18.153 --> 00:55:26.776
Don't throw away, but use it for
the betterment of people.

00:55:26.977 --> 00:55:33.430
If you want, in the beginning, have four
to five people together.

00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:39.261
Then you should separate. You have to give
time to this.

00:55:39.462 --> 00:55:47.296
You have got your realisation but you have
to give realisation

00:55:47.497 --> 00:55:58.293
otherwise, your state is not alright, is
not normal.

00:55:59.485 --> 00:56:09.097
So today I want to tell you what are
the qualities needed for a guru.

00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:24.079
First of all, he should be a detached
person.

00:56:27.487 --> 00:56:31.627
That doesn't mean you give up your family
or anything,

00:56:31.828 --> 00:56:35.889
but you should have a detached attitude

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:45.638
that anybody from your family does wrong,
you should go away from him or her.

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:56.784
Secondly, through your realisation you can
see that you can spread happiness

00:56:56.985 --> 00:57:04.080
and remove their problems. You have seen
whatever I have done you can do it.

00:57:04.281 --> 00:57:10.925
You have got power to do it but no
hypocrisy.

00:57:11.126 --> 00:57:17.538
No hypocrisy, otherwise you'll spoil
the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:17.739 --> 00:57:26.174
So if you are sure about yourself then only
you should become gurus

00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:30.421
and carry the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:30.622 --> 00:57:39.307
I think, I give you all My blessings and
all My support

00:57:39.508 --> 00:57:46.263
that now you take over and become gurus.

00:57:46.464 --> 00:57:55.489
You can also have all the pujas and then
you can use photograph.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:07.827
You have seen how one has to work it out
and if somebody has some defect

00:58:08.028 --> 00:58:15.994
or some chakras are catching, then you
should tell that person how to correct it.

00:58:16.195 --> 00:58:22.739
On the photograph it is the best. And very
humbly you should tell them

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:28.964
what is to be done and you can save all
the people.

00:58:29.165 --> 00:58:37.465
So now I am no more available in the sense,
I've done My best

00:58:37.666 --> 00:58:47.150
and I think I won't be able to do this
again.

00:58:49.155 --> 00:59:01.700
It is not My old age but I want to give you
a complete freedom to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:12.777
You have got it free and you also have to
give it to people free - not to charge them.

00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:26.899
On puja days only, be careful that don't
put yourself on the puja.

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:32.511
Till you are confirmed and you are sure

00:59:32.712 --> 00:59:40.361
that you have created at least hundred
Sahaja Yogis, good Sahaja Yogis.

00:59:40.562 --> 00:59:48.411
Then they can do your puja also. But
the best thing is to wait and see.

00:59:48.612 --> 00:59:55.979
You don't end to puja business till you are -

00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:08.149
you have done about thousand people each,
then you have the right to have a puja.

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:15.714
But you could have a puja with My
photograph till you are completely alright.

01:00:15.915 --> 01:00:19.870
Now how confidence is the main thing.

01:00:20.071 --> 01:00:26.227
Do not condemn yourself. You are all
realised souls,

01:00:26.428 --> 01:00:34.445
but those who can think they can become
gurus, can become and try.

01:00:34.646 --> 01:00:40.692
You have to have patience with the seekers.

01:00:40.893 --> 01:00:46.378
You can't be angry and hot-tempered.

01:00:46.579 --> 01:00:58.043
Unless and until they try to trouble you,
you shouldn't lose your temper.

01:00:58.244 --> 01:01:01.176
You should be quiet.

01:01:01.377 --> 01:01:08.177
Most of the gurus are very hot-tempered
or have been before

01:01:08.378 --> 01:01:11.463
and that's why they were busy with their
temper

01:01:11.664 --> 01:01:19.922
and couldn't produce anything sensible, I
think. They could never give Realisation.

01:01:20.123 --> 01:01:27.782
So, I have to warn you - control your
temper.

01:01:27.983 --> 01:01:34.766
Watch yourself if you get angry, then you
cannot become a guru.

01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:43.252
Guru has to be a loving person, very loving
and understanding.

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:54.712
Then you have to be humble, not to abuse
people, not to shout at people.

01:01:54.913 --> 01:02:02.535
If they misbehave, you can ask them
to go out, but don't shout.

01:02:02.736 --> 01:02:08.577
If you think somebody is misbehaving, you
can ask that person to get out,

01:02:08.778 --> 01:02:14.115
but you need not shout or get angry with
that person.

01:02:14.551 --> 01:02:21.997
So it's a very big responsibility now.
You've got your Realisation

01:02:22.198 --> 01:02:29.719
and so four or five of you should join
to form a Sahaja Yoga group,

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:37.724
giving Realisation to people. Try.

01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:44.487
Of course, My photograph will be there, but
still you must try.

01:02:44.688 --> 01:02:50.764
Try to understand that now what is your
responsibility.

01:02:52.224 --> 01:02:59.052
If a position is given, you have to always
carry on

01:02:59.253 --> 01:03:09.752
with the responsibility of that position.
In the same way, if you become

01:03:10.427 --> 01:03:17.928
a guru, you have a certain amount
of responsibility

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:26.402
that your own behaviour should be very good
to begin with.

01:03:29.243 --> 01:03:33.309
In the beginning, you cannot tell them,
"Don't go to church,"

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:38.962
or "Don't do this, don't do that."

01:03:39.637 --> 01:03:46.108
You give them Realization and then you can
talk to them.

01:03:47.481 --> 01:03:54.141
In the beginning, you shouldn't tell them
or they'll just shun you.

01:03:54.342 --> 01:03:58.474
Accept them as they are.

01:03:58.675 --> 01:04:04.228
In the beginning, you should not also cure
people if possible.

01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:12.801
You can use My photograph to begin with,
but don't cure them.

01:04:13.002 --> 01:04:21.799
Later on if you are confident, then four,
five together should treat that person.

01:04:27.926 --> 01:04:34.555
Curing people is not very easy and you may
catch,

01:04:34.756 --> 01:04:41.531
so before acting on them you must take
a bandhan. Bandhan is very good.

01:04:41.732 --> 01:04:47.684
You should, even when you are going out,
you should take a bandhan.

01:04:51.316 --> 01:04:58.779
You should also make a very good speech,
if possible.

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:04.829
Now you know so many things and you can
talk to them.

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:08.945
It's a very big responsibility.

01:05:09.146 --> 01:05:14.841
Now I have been working from the year 1970

01:05:15.042 --> 01:05:22.764
and today, so many years I have worked
so hard, but I can't now do it.

01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:32.974
I have to go back and take some rest as
everybody has said, and you will also agree.

01:05:33.175 --> 01:05:42.965
But you can tell about Me, if it is
necessary, but use My photograph.

01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:49.421
Every time you have a meeting, use
My photograph.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:58.000
Those who think they can be leaders and,
as gurus,

01:05:58.201 --> 01:06:07.702
they should first see their own vibrations.
Meditate on My photograph and find out.

01:06:07.903 --> 01:06:15.505
You have to be absolutely honest that you
are hundred percent all right

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:23.449
and there is no catch and then you can
become a guru.

01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:27.601
You have to be.

01:06:28.538 --> 01:06:37.223
First you may get two people, then three
people. I started with five.

01:06:37.405 --> 01:06:43.987
So you can imagine how one can go with it.

01:06:44.407 --> 01:06:52.401
Try first of all with two, three, five and
more.

01:06:52.602 --> 01:07:00.035
You can also advertise afterwards, if you
have given Realization to people,

01:07:00.236 --> 01:07:08.929
say about - you have given Realization
to ten people - you can start

01:07:09.374 --> 01:07:20.114
your own organization, or whatever you may
call, and can work it out.

01:07:20.315 --> 01:07:24.158
Now you have the power,

01:07:26.638 --> 01:07:34.933
you have the right, but you must have
a temperament also.

01:07:35.273 --> 01:07:41.674
In the beginning, you have to be very
patient and kind –

01:07:45.302 --> 01:07:48.322
very kind.

01:07:50.019 --> 01:07:54.999
Then gradually, you'll find that you can
cure people.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.434
You can use My photograph for curing
to begin with

01:07:59.635 --> 01:08:03.615
and later on you can see you can cure.

01:08:03.816 --> 01:08:10.546
First of all, on vibrations you'll see what
chakras are catching,

01:08:10.747 --> 01:08:14.692
which are good, which are bad.

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:20.680
And then you should correct them.

01:08:20.881 --> 01:08:27.523
If there's something wrong, you must
correct it and then become guru.

01:08:27.724 --> 01:08:32.113
It's not just accepting that “I am guru”
you become guru,

01:08:32.314 --> 01:08:37.352
but you have to be very, very –

01:08:41.823 --> 01:08:48.894
authority on yourself. You have to judge
yourself.

01:08:49.095 --> 01:08:54.806
First of all, you should find out: can you
become gurus?

01:08:59.371 --> 01:09:02.765
And then you can send Me your reports.

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:09.410
I'd be very happy to know how many you
have got now.

01:09:09.611 --> 01:09:16.283
And that is how Sahaja Yoga would spread,
no doubt.

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:23.370
It is - it cannot remain at this stage
because I am withdrawing,

01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:30.880
but because now you are so many Sahaja
Yogis, it will grow and work out.

01:09:31.081 --> 01:09:38.362
But I think now I can't travel, and I am
going back.

01:09:38.563 --> 01:09:45.245
I won't be able to come back again –
not possible.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:54.933
So you better work it out for yourself.

01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:59.900
You must write to Me if you have any
difficulties,

01:10:00.101 --> 01:10:06.660
if somebody is catching or something, or
you have problem.

01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:12.448
Now I don't think any newspaper will
criticize you.

01:10:12.649 --> 01:10:18.599
They have done it for Me, but not for you.

01:10:20.146 --> 01:10:28.037
All of you promise Me that you'll try
to become gurus.

01:10:33.113 --> 01:10:39.172
I didn't take any money from you, nothing
from you.

01:10:39.373 --> 01:10:45.425
I just want that you should spread Sahaja
Yoga.

01:10:45.626 --> 01:10:55.080
In the beginning, even in the pujas, don't
take any presents or money.

01:10:55.281 --> 01:10:58.945
You can only take little money from them

01:10:59.146 --> 01:11:10.270
if you have need to have a hall or a big
place,

01:11:10.471 --> 01:11:14.390
but that would be much later.

01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:20.200
First of all, try with few people.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:26.816
It will grow very well.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:30.645
Now, the another thing is,

01:11:30.846 --> 01:11:37.319
puja you should not allow them to do
to you, to begin with.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:47.380
Till you have done three hundred Sahaja
Yogis, you can't ask them to do you puja.

01:11:47.581 --> 01:11:54.246
You can use My photograph for the puja,
to begin with,

01:11:54.492 --> 01:12:01.085
but be very careful because you have powers
now

01:12:01.286 --> 01:12:11.795
and it might pamper your ego, maybe you
start thinking you are great – no.

01:12:11.996 --> 01:12:18.827
You have to save the world. All My work is
that,

01:12:19.028 --> 01:12:28.950
and I would ask you to write to Me in India
if there is any difficulty.

01:12:30.249 --> 01:12:33.841
Also write to Me how you are spreading
Sahaja Yoga,

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:38.356
what is happening, I would like to know.

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:48.299
But I think you will understand that I must
retire now. I can't travel.

01:12:50.444 --> 01:12:54.606
If you have any questions, ask Me.

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:15.678
Those who are confident that they can
become gurus, raise your hands.

01:13:19.545 --> 01:13:22.786
Oh, so many.

01:13:27.566 --> 01:13:31.640
Only one hand, not two.

01:13:38.054 --> 01:13:44.507
If anybody is making money, you should tell
him not to do it

01:13:44.693 --> 01:13:53.178
and also write to Me. You cannot make
money, to begin with,

01:13:53.444 --> 01:14:00.089
but when you have about three thousand
people,

01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:10.713
you can celebrate all the worshipping days
and worship.

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:16.164
But you must make at least three thousand
disciples, each.

01:14:16.365 --> 01:14:24.097
Then you can ask for a puja.

01:14:33.462 --> 01:14:37.899
There are some people who cannot become
gurus,

01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:43.405
who are catching and they have problems.

01:14:43.606 --> 01:14:49.555
If you have problems, don't become guru,
otherwise, it will affect you.

01:14:49.756 --> 01:14:58.338
But if you think you are clear and opened
out, then you can become gurus.

01:15:01.886 --> 01:15:05.410
Is there any question?

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:33.000
I am opening a centre for international
Sahaja Yoga

01:15:33.201 --> 01:15:37.772
and when you have done with three hundred
Sahaja Yogis,

01:15:37.973 --> 01:15:43.292
you can ask them to do puja and take money.

01:15:43.493 --> 01:15:50.501
Before that, if you get any money, you can
send it to that centre.

01:15:53.197 --> 01:15:59.861
There would be about eleven members in that
centre and I'll declare it.

01:16:00.062 --> 01:16:04.542
If you have any questions, ask Me now.

01:16:14.576 --> 01:16:19.652
First three hundred people you don't take
any money,

01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:28.682
except for the hall or except for other
expenses.

01:16:28.883 --> 01:16:35.870
But you don't take any money for yourself.

01:16:39.571 --> 01:16:45.851
Now, can you raise again your hands how
many would like to be gurus?

01:16:50.724 --> 01:16:53.907
May God bless you.

01:17:03.612 --> 01:17:07.533
Do you have any questions?

01:17:26.788 --> 01:17:31.034
You can take money on organization basis,

01:17:31.235 --> 01:17:37.363
that you have to have a hall, loudspeaker,
and all those things.

01:17:37.564 --> 01:17:42.370
But you shouldn't take it for your
individual use.

01:17:42.584 --> 01:17:49.437
You should be very careful till you have
three hundred Sahaja Yogis.

01:17:49.956 --> 01:17:59.043
You can form a group of five to ten people
and start your work.

01:17:59.244 --> 01:18:02.273
You'll enjoy it.

01:18:12.555 --> 01:18:17.188
Anyone has any problem, ask Me.

01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:46.354
I have to go to Canada - I have not been,
but I'll try to find some time.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:54.405
First now I have to go to Russia, and then
I can go to Canada.

01:18:57.603 --> 01:19:05.254
You have to work more in your country than
outside, to begin with,

01:19:06.952 --> 01:19:11.326
and then you can spread it all over.

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:20.537
Again let us see how many want to be gurus?

01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:26.394
Oh! What a big number.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:31.765
Thank you very much, thank you, thank
you all.

01:20:02.069 --> 01:20:04.234
Yogi: Should we do the Aarti?
Shri Mataji: Yes, you may do, it went well.

01:20:04.435 --> 01:20:08.185
Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: From where are they all?

01:20:19.902 --> 01:20:22.724
Yogi: Are we permitted to do Aarti? Aarti?
Shri Mataji: We should go…

01:20:22.925 --> 01:20:26.642
Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: Do Aarti.
