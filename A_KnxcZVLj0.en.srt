1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,933
We all have today gathered here

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:13,849
on top of this beautiful mountain,

3
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:19,266
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

4
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:24,225
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

5
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:30,642
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

6
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:35,016
by which He showed

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,682
that the spirit does not die.

8
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:43,475
He was – He was the Omkara,

9
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:48,225
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

10
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:54,392
and that is why He could walk on the water.

11
00:00:55,517 --> 00:01:00,266
And also now we have made a film

12
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,849
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

13
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:09,392
which shows the carbon atom,

14
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:13,682
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

15
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:17,642
you find a proper swastika there;

16
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:23,392
and left to the right we see Omkara.

17
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:26,392
But when you see from down below upward,

18
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:30,392
what you see is alpha and omega.

19
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:35,266
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,933
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

21
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:45,808
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

22
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:50,183
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

23
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:56,183
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

24
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:01,141
I don’t know at the time of Christ

25
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:05,308
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

26
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:07,933
but definitely to Him

27
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,058
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

28
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:26,100
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

29
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:31,808
and very important for our ascent.

30
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,724
If He had not resurrected Himself,

31
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:41,266
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

32
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:44,683
So it’s a great contribution.

33
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:49,933
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

34
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:53,891
what you were before

35
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,475
and what you are today.

36
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:03,392
It is such a change,

37
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,933
such a difference,

38
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:09,183
such a transformation.

39
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:13,642
It is His own sacrifice

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,558
on the cross

41
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:19,558
and His own

42
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,600
beautiful resurrection

43
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:26,100
has created a way for all of us

44
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:31,682
to get into this new transformed state.

45
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:42,308
In this state is a different story for human beings,

46
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:45,141
and a different for Christ.

47
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,558
Christ was Himself

48
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:52,058
was holiness, was purity.

49
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:56,016
So His resurrection

50
00:03:56,308 --> 00:04:02,766
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

51
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:08,266
because He did not need transformation,

52
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,849
He did not

53
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:16,642
have to go through any cleansing.

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,433
But what happened in His case

55
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,225
was that He became

56
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:31,891
resurrected from death

57
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:36,933
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

58
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:39,891
is like a death;

59
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:42,266
because they do everything

60
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:48,225
without any understanding about the totality,

61
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,600
about the reality,

62
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:54,974
about the absolute truth.

63
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,558
Whatever they do ultimately

64
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:02,058
takes them to their destruction.

65
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:07,058
Even the religions which are established

66
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,517
by these great incarnations

67
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:14,308
are absolutely on a decline.

68
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:18,683
You do not find any trace of religious life

69
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,600
with all those people

70
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:23,808
who claim that they are the ones

71
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:27,933
who can represent those incarnations.

72
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:31,683
If you see in a subtle way

73
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,016
it’s very painful also,

74
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:38,517
that in the name of all these great incarnations

75
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,433
the kind of work people are doing,

76
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:46,392
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

77
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:49,682
because they have no fear of God.

78
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,183
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

79
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,183
all over the world.

80
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:56,600
Of course here,

81
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,808
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

82
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,058
Everywhere people are seeing

83
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:04,724
all these false things have been exposed.

84
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,974
But these false things they have used

85
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:13,433
under a garb of God,

86
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:16,642
spirituality and beauty.

87
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:20,266
That’s the best way you can hide.

88
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:25,766
All the cruelty, all the violence,

89
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:29,600
all the ugliness

90
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,933
– this is how they have worked it out.

91
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:37,016
And it has gone into such a state

92
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,433
that you do not find the slightest

93
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,308
even tinge of religious life among these people.

94
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:47,724
Like all the thieves of the world,

95
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,016
all the great crooks of the world

96
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:54,016
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

97
00:06:56,266 --> 00:07:00,558
It’s only because what was written in all the books

98
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,724
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

99
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,683
was never done.

100
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:12,682
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

101
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,517
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

102
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,308
He also said that “You are to be born again”

103
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:22,600
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

104
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:28,433
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

105
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,724
But they don’t think that actually

106
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,683
what benevolence it has given them.

107
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,933
At the most they might have made some money,

108
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,724
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,100
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,849
One must pity their insanity,

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,308
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

112
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:01,225
or to anybody else’s life

113
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,933
of such a noble and a higher value system,

114
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:12,433
and are doing all very low-graded things.

115
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:19,600
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

116
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:23,766
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

117
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:28,475
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

118
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:33,475
that you are coming from that environment,

119
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:36,682
that style of life,

120
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,308
that kind of thinking

121
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:41,891
which was all for your destruction.

122
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:46,558
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

123
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:49,600
So when you’re coming out of it,

124
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:53,058
still these things hang over,

125
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:58,433
still you get affected by them.

126
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:01,642
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

127
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,225
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

128
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:08,100
to some sort of a funny situation,

129
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:13,891
to some sort of a degrading things.

130
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:17,350
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

131
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,600
sometimes you accept all that.

132
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:23,392
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

133
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:25,475
that after coming to realization

134
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,891
he has to be very introspective.

135
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:31,141
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

136
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:35,266
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

137
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,016
It’s very important that you have to know

138
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:44,350
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

139
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:49,225
Because Christ did not need this,

140
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:53,558
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

141
00:09:54,058 --> 00:10:00,392
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

142
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:07,558
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

143
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:10,225
on the sense that from He died

144
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:13,724
and then He resurrected Himself.

145
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:17,433
But for us it is very different.

146
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:20,849
We are now Sahaja yogis,

147
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:24,724
but we were ordinary human beings.

148
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,600
We had no light within us.

149
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:30,016
Now the light comes within us

150
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:32,682
and we see the light,

151
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:36,392
then what do we become?

152
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:40,266
We have to become the light itself.

153
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,433
Christ was the light.

154
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,350
He did not have to become.

155
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:46,683
So we have to become the light.

156
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:50,891
And now you have to guard on

157
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:55,350
the way this light might get disturbed,

158
00:10:55,683 --> 00:11:01,016
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

159
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:07,141
So carrying on yourself with this light,

160
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,849
first thing you should know that

161
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,517
if you see the light, is not proper

162
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,183
– means you are not the light.

163
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:18,016
You have to become the light.

164
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:20,849
When you are the light,

165
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,891
then in that light you can easily see

166
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,724
how your mind works,

167
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:29,308
what ideas it gives,

168
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:36,225
what affects your mind

169
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,891
while you’re ascending.

170
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,141
Is this the worry

171
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:46,933
or is this the responsibility that you have?

172
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:51,558
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

173
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,724
that there is an impediment

174
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,225
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

175
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,682
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

176
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:08,058
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

177
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:12,558
It’s a very beautiful journey

178
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,642
– very, very beautiful journey.

179
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,308
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

180
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:22,308
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

181
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:28,558
the journey of kundalini.

182
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:38,266
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

183
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:44,642
Basically you were not a realized soul,

184
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:47,891
but now you are a realized soul.

185
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,266
You are a evolved state.

186
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:56,475
Now what is missing is the idea

187
00:12:56,933 --> 00:13:01,891
that we are absolutely all right

188
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:06,683
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

189
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,724
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

190
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,891
it’s not going to help you at all.

191
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:19,392
What you have to do is to

192
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,016
all the time introspect yourself.

193
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,600
That’s what is meditation for,

194
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,517
to see for yourself

195
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:30,974
how you are keeping up

196
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:34,642
your spiritual ascent.

197
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,558
No one else can do it,

198
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:39,392
it’s your own individual work.

199
00:13:39,682 --> 00:13:41,642
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

200
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,683
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

201
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:48,808
They may not say, they may not refer it,

202
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:50,682
but they will know definitely

203
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:52,808
that such-and-such chakra is catching

204
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,141
and this person has this problem.

205
00:13:55,558 --> 00:14:00,266
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

206
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,766
what is their problem is.

207
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:07,225
So if somebody tells you

208
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,475
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

209
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,475
you should never, never feel bad about it,

210
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:15,517
because by keeping that chakra intact

211
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:18,724
you are ruining your own life.

212
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,682
So what you have to do is to see

213
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:23,808
that if somebody tells you that

214
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:28,100
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

215
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,058
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

216
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:34,058
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

217
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,600
there’s something wrong with your face,

218
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:38,308
you can immediately correct it.

219
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:42,308
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

220
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:46,100
you have to be mature enough that you should know

221
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,100
that it is a great blessing

222
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:51,600
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

223
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,266
Like the other day there was some quarrel

224
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,016
between the two leaders.

225
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:58,849
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

226
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,433
There should not be.

227
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:04,225
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

228
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,891
two legs do not fight.

229
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:09,183
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

230
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,724
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

231
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:17,308
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

232
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:22,266
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

233
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:26,308
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

234
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,974
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

235
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,974
When he puts his hand towards Me,

236
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,266
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

237
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,808
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

238
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:41,016
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

239
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,517
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

240
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:47,558
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

241
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:53,642
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

242
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:56,558
because I said it to him.

243
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,141
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

244
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:02,475
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

245
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:03,933
what is good for him.

246
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:05,683
He did not feel bad at all.

247
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:08,183
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

248
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,350
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

249
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:16,100
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

250
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,683
Now, the problem with us is that

251
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:31,308
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

252
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,808
and we have consolidated it.

253
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,308
Also, we have a great collective force,

254
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:40,183
I can see, in every country.

255
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:43,350
We can give realizations to so many,

256
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,350
and we can really establish

257
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:51,475
all these great truths in our lives.

258
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,308
We can do it.

259
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:57,183
All the time we should establish them.

260
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:01,350
But there is one point

261
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:04,808
on which one should not be very sure:

262
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:11,433
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

263
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:15,100
You have to be careful on this point very much.

264
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:21,308
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

265
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:26,392
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

266
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:30,808
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

267
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,600
The reason is that they have no faith

268
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:41,558
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

269
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,642
This is the faith which is missing.

270
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:50,849
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

271
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:55,808
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

272
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:04,141
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

273
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:11,849
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

274
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:13,974
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

275
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:16,392
– you have known that it is so.

276
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:18,392
But even knowing that,

277
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:22,225
it has not become such a faith within you.

278
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:26,475
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

279
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:29,350
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

280
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:31,183
not the blind faith.

281
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,016
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

282
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:39,558
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

283
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:44,808
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

284
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,433
There cannot be any problems

285
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:51,266
if your faith is enlightened.

286
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:54,933
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

287
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,766
many people who are very steady,

288
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,683
who are upright,

289
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,558
who are very valuable.

290
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,891
They are like the people

291
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:12,433
who know they are standing on the rocks.

292
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:17,016
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

293
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:20,433
they think they are still dwindling

294
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:26,517
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

295
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:32,724
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

296
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:37,350
and also that has come out of faith

297
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:40,849
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

298
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:43,849
nothing can trouble us.

299
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,683
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

300
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,766
I mean, He knew everything,

301
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:52,183
so He was sure about it.

302
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:56,350
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

303
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:00,392
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

304
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,433
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

305
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,600
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

306
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,849
It is so.

307
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,517
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

308
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:17,350
while the other people,

309
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:21,974
even Sahaja yogis,

310
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,642
have to become like Christ

311
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,891
as far as the faith is concerned.

312
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:33,849
This faith is to be understood.

313
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:37,475
This is an enlightened faith.

314
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:42,183
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

315
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,058
He went into all kinds of things,

316
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:49,475
just because He knew it was just a drama

317
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:54,100
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

318
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,849
and there’s nothing serious,

319
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,016
nothing is going to matter,

320
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,849
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

321
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,475
He played the drama.

322
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:08,433
To Him it was nothing very serious.

323
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:14,682
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

324
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:19,433
He also in His heart knew everything that

325
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:23,808
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

326
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:28,682
But at the same time,

327
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:32,600
He was the embodiment of faith:

328
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,600
faith in Himself

329
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,682
and in this all-pervading Power.

330
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,392
This never lets you down,

331
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:50,766
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

332
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:56,225
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

333
00:21:57,475 --> 00:22:01,558
naturally I will give him all the work,

334
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,475
I will trust everything,

335
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,808
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

336
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:11,433
never doubt such a person.

337
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,849
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

338
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:25,308
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

339
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,225
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

340
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,808
how life will improve

341
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:39,392
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

342
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:42,225
You’ll have no doubts,

343
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,350
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

344
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:54,141
So, this is such a state

345
00:22:54,682 --> 00:22:56,392
– only with faith.

346
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:59,642
But now this faith, how do you get?

347
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:04,225
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

348
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,016
There’s no course about it,

349
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:08,225
there’s no literature about it,

350
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,849
there’s no lecture about it.

351
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:16,724
But there is an awakening within you

352
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:21,225
which will ask this

353
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:24,266
“What am I?” – this awakening,

354
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:27,058
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

355
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:32,891
You see, this will question

356
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:38,766
“What is it that I have achieved?

357
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:42,433
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

358
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:45,475
All these questions will come to you.

359
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,016
But if you have faith,

360
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,849
not the blind but the enlightened

361
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:53,808
which is established by many miracles in life,

362
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,308
many things in life;

363
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:58,475
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

364
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:00,016
small, small things.

365
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,433
There have been miracles even in big things,

366
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,558
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

367
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:08,600
So now you know, very well settled,

368
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:12,517
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

369
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:15,600
For example, it starts raining.

370
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,183
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

371
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,225
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

372
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,808
nothing can happen.

373
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:26,350
Let it rain as much as it likes.

374
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:30,475
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

375
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,558
it’s not going to drench us.

376
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:38,058
In the same way this faith within us

377
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:42,141
has to be absolutely solid,

378
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,808
and that makes you extremely strong

379
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,683
and makes you responsible

380
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:52,308
for the resurrection of thousands

381
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:57,100
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

382
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:06,517
This kind of life that we have

383
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:13,600
– that only by our own establishment,

384
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:17,683
by our own understanding,

385
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:23,724
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

386
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,308
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

387
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:31,891
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

388
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:36,475
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

389
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:41,100
You all should have the chance

390
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:45,266
to know your spirit

391
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:49,891
and to know yourself.

392
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,350
So one has to have faith in oneself.

393
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:56,016
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

394
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:59,392
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

395
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,766
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

396
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:10,849
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

397
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:14,475
What do you want?

398
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:19,141
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

399
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
even if you don’t ask.

400
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:29,058
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

401
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:32,974
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

402
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:36,016
because this all-pervading Power

403
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:38,141
is the only real power,

404
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:41,433
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

405
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:49,016
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

406
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:56,766
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

407
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,433
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

408
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:03,517
and he was deceived by someone

409
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:06,350
and made him buy a land and a house

410
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:10,682
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

411
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:12,058
And this fellow said,

412
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,891
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

413
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,974
they will not say anything to you.”

414
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:18,682
He believed him – had wrong faith,

415
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:22,683
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

416
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:28,558
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

417
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:35,517
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

418
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:42,016
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

419
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:45,350
and so many people came and saw all this.

420
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:49,891
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

421
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:51,558
he could not understand,

422
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,558
“Why it has happened to me

423
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:57,933
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

424
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:01,600
And he was deceived and he was,

425
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,600
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

426
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,766
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

427
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:12,600
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

428
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:19,183
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

429
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:25,225
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

430
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:28,724
That’s all – “Have faith.”

431
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,433
And what a miraculous thing happened,

432
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:36,558
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

433
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:41,517
And that fellow said,

434
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:44,933
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

435
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:48,350
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

436
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:52,600
that I want to pay.”

437
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:58,891
It’s something unbelievable.

438
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,517
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

439
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:09,100
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

440
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:12,225
Nothing worked out, nothing

441
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,724
– only his faith.

442
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:18,849
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

443
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:20,808
He was supposed to go to jail,

444
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:22,475
now he’s going to become a rich man.

445
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:25,266
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

446
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:27,266
This is just the financial side of it,

447
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:28,475
but I know you know

448
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,724
that there are so many other miracles happening.

449
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:35,350
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

450
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:39,183
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

451
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:43,266
After realization at least you should take to faith.

452
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,600
That really is something surprising

453
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:49,016
that people get their realization and everything,

454
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:53,766
still they do not have faith in themselves.

455
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:59,600
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

456
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:04,974
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

457
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,016
faith was part and parcel of His being.

458
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:13,225
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

459
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:16,808
Now we have to have it.

460
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:21,058
We have to believe in ourselves.

461
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,766
There’s so many incidents I can give you

462
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:26,642
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

463
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,058
where just the faith has helped.

464
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,808
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

465
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,475
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

466
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,058
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

467
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:44,225
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

468
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,682
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

469
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:48,308
She said it three times.

470
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,642
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

471
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,266
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

472
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,350
She just got up, walked out.

473
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:58,225
And then she started running all the way,

474
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:00,600
and everybody started laughing.

475
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:02,642
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

476
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:05,266
I said, “But see her faith!”

477
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:11,808
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

478
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:19,141
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

479
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:22,849
They have shown faith in that person.

480
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:24,683
As I have told you always,

481
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,016
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

482
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:30,100
One among hundred might deceive us

483
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:31,891
doesn’t matter, we trust.

484
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,016
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

485
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,225
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

486
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:41,517
But what about deities?

487
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:44,849
You show faith in them and it works,

488
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:46,600
immediately they work out.

489
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:48,266
Like Guido told Me that

490
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:51,392
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

491
00:31:51,891 --> 00:31:53,558
for these two days.”

492
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:58,058
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

493
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:02,141
It disappeared.

494
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,141
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

495
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:14,974
And when we talk of faith, you know,

496
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:21,266
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

497
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:27,100
which organizes, which knows everything,

498
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:29,724
which is so intelligent, efficient

499
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:31,682
– above all, it loves you.

500
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:35,141
And then you show faith.

501
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:43,808
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

502
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:49,766
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

503
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:51,683
They don’t feel then bad,

504
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,808
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

505
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,683
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

506
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:01,141
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

507
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:04,058
whether this thing happens or not.

508
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,475
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

509
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:10,141
Supposing you are lost on the way,

510
00:33:10,517 --> 00:33:13,808
know that it has to be that way.

511
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:18,350
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

512
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,266
He was to be crucified.

513
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,100
He had to carry the cross,

514
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,058
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

515
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:28,475
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

516
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:31,350
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

517
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:35,724
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

518
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:39,266
But this faith in Him gave Him

519
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:44,766
such a tremendous powers.

520
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:47,891
He could have done anything.

521
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:50,392
He could have killed all these people

522
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:54,308
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

523
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:56,642
Just one glance could have killed them.

524
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:00,100
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

525
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:01,642
He went through it.

526
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:05,475
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

527
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:08,683
He is the one who won everything.

528
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:11,225
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

529
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,433
has to look at one’s own life.

530
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:20,225
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

531
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:25,266
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

532
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:27,682
In the evolutionary process

533
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,642
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

534
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:38,475
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

535
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,517
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

536
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,683
most of the people are not going to be there.

537
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:46,600
Not that we are not available,

538
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:52,682
but because they are not fated

539
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:54,933
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

540
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,558
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

541
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,475
So, you are so fortunate

542
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:03,724
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

543
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,100
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

544
00:35:07,517 --> 00:35:11,933
in your resurrection that is your being now.

545
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,475
And with that you will know how precious

546
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,642
you are for the whole world,

547
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,141
and that what you have to do is not

548
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:24,225
to think of material gains, physical gains

549
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:29,933
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

550
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:35,350
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

551
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:37,891
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

552
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:40,517
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

553
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:41,974
everything works out,

554
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:46,141
everything in its own time shows its own results.

555
00:35:48,308 --> 00:35:52,100
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

556
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,642
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

557
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:06,600
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

558
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:08,433
“All right, Mother says so.

559
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,974
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

560
00:36:12,558 --> 00:36:14,225
Like the other day I had a journalist,

561
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:17,642
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

562
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:19,016
I said, “Why?”

563
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,683
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

564
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,058
How can there be a blind child,

565
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,849
how can this and how can that?”

566
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:31,766
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

567
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:33,891
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

568
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:37,600
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

569
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:42,891
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

570
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:47,766
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

571
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:52,600
So the situation is explainable;

572
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:57,475
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

573
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:01,933
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

574
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,225
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

575
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:08,642
have you any problems? None.”

576
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:13,683
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

577
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,891
Now if you say that there is a way out

578
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,350
and that there is a solution,

579
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:24,808
and that a time can come

580
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:28,058
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

581
00:37:28,475 --> 00:37:31,849
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

582
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:35,350
so why not see this?

583
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:39,433
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

584
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:44,682
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

585
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,517
So this kind of negative attitude

586
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,016
also Sahaja yogis can have.

587
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:53,724
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

588
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:56,682
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

589
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:00,225
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

590
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:05,225
You can cure, your faith can cure.

591
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:08,558
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

592
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:10,183
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

593
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:14,308
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

594
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:16,933
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

595
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:21,849
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

596
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,058
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

597
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:28,266
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

598
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,766
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

599
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,642
Third day he was out of hospital,

600
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:35,100
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

601
00:38:35,517 --> 00:38:39,100
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

602
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,724
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

603
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,392
the deities have to work it out.

604
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:48,016
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

605
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:51,392
It’s the deities who stood by it.

606
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:01,808
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

607
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,600
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

608
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,849
Why not we develop that complete faith

609
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,225
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

610
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:18,600
we are in the Kingdom of God,

611
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,350
and that this Power is going to look after us?

612
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:26,475
Then we’ll have no choices,

613
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:32,808
we’ll have no hesitation.

614
00:39:33,683 --> 00:39:37,225
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

615
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:40,100
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

616
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:42,682
or go anywhere – so what?

617
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:46,350
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

618
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:49,350
it’s perfectly all right.

619
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:52,266
And no worry of any kind.

620
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,225
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

621
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:57,974
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

622
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,100
Everything drops out.

623
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:01,808
Doesn’t matter.

624
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:05,100
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

625
00:40:05,558 --> 00:40:09,350
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

626
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:10,766
Like people tell Me,

627
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,475
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

628
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:15,600
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

629
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:18,433
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

630
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:20,016
only the seat is changed.

631
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,683
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

632
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:27,808
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

633
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:35,392
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

634
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,475
then you don’t bother.

635
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:41,392
Many people will find out whether

636
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:44,141
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

637
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:49,058
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

638
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:53,974
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

639
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:58,016
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

640
00:40:58,517 --> 00:41:01,392
Nothing can bind you,

641
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:03,600
nothing can pull you down,

642
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:07,766
no habit can come back on you;

643
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:15,058
because faith will purify you completely,

644
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,683
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

645
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:22,974
This faith is not something

646
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:25,058
that can be put into your heads

647
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:29,058
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

648
00:41:29,766 --> 00:41:34,600
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

649
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:40,308
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

650
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:45,517
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

651
00:41:46,642 --> 00:41:48,642
would be established,

652
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,808
would be effective,

653
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:56,600
and for the whole world will be a model.

654
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:01,766
May God bless you all.

655
00:42:34,558 --> 00:42:39,058
There are just the children, there are so many children.

656
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:43,642
Today is the day of Christ,

657
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:48,100
so we should have children in any case to wash My feet.

658
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:54,392
Can you fit it there, or you will have to move it?
