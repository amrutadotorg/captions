00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.320
Now this futuristic behavior starts in a society where

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.654
people always think of the future.

00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:15.695
“What will I do, what am I to do tomorrow,

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.529
what am I to achieve tomorrow?”

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.649
And all these things, when they start doing

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.320
their attention goes to the right extreme.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.111
Now, in this place we are very dangerously placed,

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:30.111
very dangerously placed, when we start looking for the

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:38.861
future and the future seeing is a imaginary stuff,

00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:43.695
is absolutely imaginary, because what you think

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:47.986
of the future doesn’t exist. What exists is the present,

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:50.986
you have to be in the present not in the future.

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:54.899
But people will say you have to be in the present, but how?

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.695
We cannot. Either we are in the past or in the future.

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:03.362
Because when the thought wave rises, it comes up and goes down.

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:07.445
Another thought wave rises, goes up and comes down.

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:10.320
Now, this thought wave which comes up,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.903
we go with it but we don’t see it’s going down.

00:01:13.023 --> 00:01:16.111
Another thought wave that rises, we see that but

00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:17.861
don’t see where it goes out.

00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:20.320
And so we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.861
and we do not know, perhaps we are with the past

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:27.654
or perhaps with the future. But in the center of these two

00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:30.487
thoughts there is the present and we don’t know

00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:33.779
how to take our attention there, which is a very difficult thing

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.669
and just to say that you should be in the center is not possible.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.570
All these things, “You should do this, you should do that,”

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.695
is not going to work out unless and until there is light.

00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:46.695
For example, there is no light in this room and you say,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.362
“Walk straight,” you cannot walk because you can’t see

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.037
where is the passage, how to walk.

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:53.150
Even if you order, do whatever you please,

00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:56.362
you cannot just walk straight without touching any of these

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:59.612
chairs because there is no light, you can’t see.

00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:02.695
So one has to understand that in the

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.487
futuristic life when we live and we plan too

00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:08.320
much for the future, actually what we are doing,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.093
we are living in an imaginary world.

00:02:11.174 --> 00:02:13.779
We have many stories of people who lived in imaginary

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:18.487
worlds and how they found that everything was destroyed.

00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:22.861
And there are people who work it out through their

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.654
physical efforts, and when they go into their physical

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:29.445
efforts they create another problem for them because

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:33.237
they just become physically oriented people.

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:35.861
And if you are just physically oriented,

00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:38.487
the Spirit gets angry with you.

00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:41.695
So the right side movement is for the people who

00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:44.570
are very meticulous, you see, which you can call the people

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.570
who are very particular about the time and who are very

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.445
firm about things, who are very dry people and who are very

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:55.819
straight and they won’t tolerate any nonsense.

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.445
One sort of people, you see, that you find normally and

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:02.570
that sort of people become a headache and

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.770
they are very boring, you see.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.695
You can’t just bear their company,

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:08.321
they can be very boring people.

00:03:08.402 --> 00:03:10.861
And they give you big lectures about how to be

00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:14.111
straightforward and how to walk straight absolutely.

00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:18.153
In the nature nothing is straight, it all moves so

00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:23.711
beautifully because the nature is created out of varieties, and variety brings the beauty.

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:26.445
They don’t think of beauty, they don’t think of love,

00:03:26.565 --> 00:03:29.695
of compassion, nothing. For them it is a very meticulous

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:31.986
world and that’s how they live.

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:36.570
Such people are developing a big ego within themselves,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.570
as you see there, is a yellow stuff in the head called as ego.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.362
By the action of the left side, emotional side,

00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:51.362
we develop a superego, but by the action of the right side

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:56.612
we develop a ego. Now this ego is not easy to be seen.

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:59.737
Because if you have a superego you have pains

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:03.278
in the body, you are a miserable person, you have wrinkles

00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:06.903
on the face and you look absolutely worn out.

00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:10.320
But if you have ego then you look so dynamic.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.570
We can say that Hitler was the extreme of this ego business.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.278
And he got into his head that he is some sort of a god

00:04:19.398 --> 00:04:22.237
incarnation and that he has to save the people,

00:04:22.357 --> 00:04:25.861
and he was the one who knows about races and everything

00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:29.986
and he is supposed to save some race.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:33.695
This kind of idea comes from these people who

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:37.903
are right sided, they are very aggressive, they may be very

00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:42.362
good to talk to, they may be very humble to look at,

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:45.237
could be very good business men, could be anything,

00:04:45.357 --> 00:04:48.362
but they do not know that they have this Mister Ego

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:51.445
coming up on their heads just like a big balloon

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:54.986
and they are floating in the air. The end of ego is stupidity.

00:04:55.106 --> 00:04:57.819
You’ll be surprised, the end of ego is stupidity.

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:01.237
Such people indulge into all kinds of stupid things,

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:03.487
and they say, “What’s wrong?”

00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:07.028
For example I’ve known old people behaving in so

00:05:07.148 --> 00:05:09.819
stupid ways, and they say, “What’s wrong?”

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.028
You know, an old man, say of ninety years,

00:05:12.148 --> 00:05:16.028
Who can’t even walk without a stick, takes to these dances you

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:19.153
do and then he falls down, you see, and

00:05:19.273 --> 00:05:22.111
he thinks, “what’s wrong?” Like a lady I knew, she was

00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:26.153
about eighty-five, she died from a horse falling down.

00:05:26.273 --> 00:05:29.278
Naturally I mean what else you expect at eighty-five,

00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:32.243
that’s what is evident, for a lady of eighty-five she should

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:34.601
settle down at home, look after her grandchildren,

00:05:34.682 --> 00:05:36.981
maybe she might have great grandchildren, you see.

00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:40.001
Instead of that why does she want to be twenty-five-year-old

00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:42.362
lady to climb on a horse?

00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:46.111
So all such stupid things they do and then they will say,

00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:49.362
“What’s wrong?” Is nothing wrong in stupidity, what’s wrong?

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:55.237
But such people are a nuisance to the society, to others.

00:05:55.357 --> 00:05:59.111
The people who are superego are troublesome to themselves,

00:05:59.231 --> 00:06:03.570
but those are egoistical are troublesome to others.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.819
They are all the time correcting others, torturing others,

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.737
putting their ideas on to other people, and such people

00:06:10.857 --> 00:06:13.903
can be very, very successful because nothing

00:06:14.023 --> 00:06:15.695
succeeds like success.

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:19.278
They go on hammering things into the heads of people,

00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:21.357
saying, “Now this is true, this is true,”

00:06:21.438 --> 00:06:24.066
and when you go on saying it, this you suddenly believe,

00:06:24.147 --> 00:06:27.737
“Yes, must be so.” And such people are much more dangerous

00:06:27.857 --> 00:06:29.819
I would say from the superego type.

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.819
But for people who do not know the tricks of the

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:41.278
superego they can be very, very, very dangerous because

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:45.403
they are very subtle, you cannot see them, they mesmerize,

00:06:45.523 --> 00:06:51.153
and they can possess you and they can be very sly, and they can

00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:54.945
work out all sorts of methods which you are not aware.

00:06:55.065 --> 00:06:59.737
So it is not easy to choose which is better, which is not better.

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:02.482
Both things are wrong to go to extremes,

00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:04.549
on the right or to the left.
