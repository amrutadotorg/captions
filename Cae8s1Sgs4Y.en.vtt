00:04.600 --> 00:09.160
As I am today talking about only on
the left, I would say that to feel

00:09.240 --> 00:14.820
miserable for nothing at all is also
wrong, is being unjust to yourself.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.280
The people who are left sided must
know that they are the Spirit,

00:21.420 --> 00:27.700
that they are that beauty which has to come,
which has to express itself. That they are not

00:27.780 --> 00:37.120
the people who have to suffer all the time and
to live like miserable people. They are not. But

00:37.200 --> 00:42.880
because they take so much upon themselves, bear
so much upon themselves, they become like that.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.700
And to avoid that bearing up they may take to
some other habits, you see. Many people take to

00:48.780 --> 00:55.600
alcohol also for reason because they can’t bear
the pangs of life, they can’t bear it. That’s

00:55.680 --> 01:00.420
why they take to it. But once the Spirit is
awakened within you, you become so strong,

01:01.740 --> 01:08.440
you become so joyous, so spontaneous that
all these things drop out, all those things,

01:08.520 --> 01:16.380
so-called diseases, so-called habits, just drop
out and you become a new, blooming personality.

01:18.360 --> 01:26.860
Now the basics of having this center
within you – you can blame God for that,

01:26.940 --> 01:31.840
“Why did He give us these centers on the left hand
side, what was the need? He should not have given

01:31.920 --> 01:36.760
these left sided ones, so we would have been
just in the center to go.” But the trouble is,

01:36.840 --> 01:44.800
the human beings have to know in their own
freedom, how to deal with themselves. They have

01:44.880 --> 01:51.780
to learn little hard way the wisdom. They have
to know by going to extremes they have suffered.

01:52.920 --> 02:03.880
They have to realize it because if they have to
become truly, absolutely free they have to rise

02:03.960 --> 02:10.600
in their wisdom. If they’re not wise people,
then they cannot enter into the Kingdom of

02:10.680 --> 02:15.880
God because they’ll be abandoned people.
Say, people who are abandoned, who don’t

02:15.960 --> 02:20.340
understand any laws or regulations, if you get
them in England, we’ll have to put them in jail.

02:21.720 --> 02:28.120
In the same way, human beings who have
not got that wisdom within themselves –

02:28.200 --> 02:33.700
through sufferings only one learns, but we should
not ask for suffering. When we ask for sufferings,

02:33.780 --> 02:38.500
we are asking actually for mistakes to begin
with. How will you suffer if you do not commit

02:38.580 --> 02:44.800
mistakes? So when we ask for sufferings we are
committing mistakes. So what we should ask for is

02:44.880 --> 02:51.580
nothing but our Spirit. And if you ask for your
Spirit, it is your own and you have to get it,

02:51.660 --> 02:58.480
it is in your own right that you’re going to
get it. Is no way that I’m obliging you or doing

02:58.560 --> 03:04.000
something special for you, it’s all there. You
are like a light which is just to be enlightened

03:04.080 --> 03:10.060
because I’m an enlightened light and you become
an enlightened light, you can enlighten other

03:10.140 --> 03:16.360
lights also. It’s very simple. If you become
an enlightened light, you can enlighten others.

03:16.440 --> 03:21.640
You don’t have to bother about anything else then.
You become an enlightened light yourself, that’s

03:21.720 --> 03:29.040
the point. It is all there, it is all your own,
you have to just have it. It is as simple as that.

03:29.640 --> 03:37.720
There is nothing very complicated as these people
make it or anything that these philosophers have

03:37.800 --> 03:42.900
put before you. Nothing of the kind. It’s very
simple, it is within you, it is spontaneous,

03:43.680 --> 03:47.920
it is a living process, as in living
process you have become human beings,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.680
you are going to become super human beings. It’s
absolutely spontaneous, you can’t pay for it.

03:53.760 --> 03:58.140
How can you pay? I mean, absurd
it is! If it is a living process

04:00.960 --> 04:07.060
how can you pay? How much do you pay to the tree
to grow up? I mean in anything living, do we pay

04:07.140 --> 04:13.600
anything? How much do we pay our nose to breathe?
Can we pay for it? It’s absurd, it’s ridiculous.

04:13.680 --> 04:19.840
Can we pay for it? We cannot, it’s a living
process, we have to become, an egg has to become a

04:19.920 --> 04:27.760
chick. Now how much do you pay an egg to become a
chick? Or how much does the egg pay to the mother

04:27.840 --> 04:38.500
for becoming a chicken? It’s that ridiculous,
but we never understand that living things are so

04:38.580 --> 04:44.500
spontaneous. We never see living things, we live
with matter, we live with the dead, not with the

04:44.580 --> 04:50.160
living things. If you start watching a tree, you
start watching a flower, how it becomes a fruit.

04:51.480 --> 04:57.280
You can’t even watch because it does it so
slowly, you can’t even watch a flower becoming

04:57.360 --> 05:05.140
a fruit. Suddenly you find all coming up. Like
when I came to London from India I found all the

05:05.220 --> 05:11.920
trees were bare, absolutely like dry sticks,
absolutely like dry sticks. Within a week,

05:12.000 --> 05:19.480
what I find is the green coming up; and within
second week it was all lush, you can’t believe it.

05:20.940 --> 05:26.980
We never even notice, we take it for granted, it’s
happening. How does it happen? It’s a miraculous

05:27.060 --> 05:31.840
thing. If you see it, it’s miraculous! How
these flowers, for example the particular

05:31.920 --> 05:37.560
flowers are only on a particular tree and others,
another, are on another tree. How does it happen?

05:38.580 --> 05:44.860
Who chooses them? Who puts them in proper shape?
Who organizes all that? And this is what one has

05:44.940 --> 05:52.060
to realize and that is the All -pervading
Power of God that does all the living work.

05:52.140 --> 05:57.180
And once you become that – the Spirit –
then this power starts flowing through

05:58.020 --> 06:02.580
you. You feel the power through
you as Christ was touched and

06:03.720 --> 06:10.780
He said some power has gone to someone, like that.
You just become a medium of that power flowing.

06:10.860 --> 06:17.320
But you are empowered to manoeuvre
it, to manage it, to understand it.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.160
You know completely about it, you know how
to give it, you know to how to work it out,

06:21.240 --> 06:28.860
you know how to cure others, cure yourself. You
know the complete working of your machinery.

06:29.640 --> 06:35.940
Apart from that, you get the powers to overcome
all the problems of your own machinery also.

06:37.980 --> 06:43.120
It’s so fantastic, whole thing sounds very
fantastic because we have never seen this

06:43.200 --> 06:49.960
before. But to us it doesn’t sound fantastic
when we see all these flowers suddenly turning

06:50.040 --> 06:55.440
into fruits. It doesn’t sound. But we
see human beings turning into fruits,

06:56.280 --> 07:01.660
then it sounds very fantastic, “How can that be?”
It has never happened before. Only one person

07:01.740 --> 07:06.840
would get realization and it was such a difficult
thing and nobody got it. How is it today?

07:09.180 --> 07:13.740
I say, it’s the blossom time, which
is been promised, which is been

07:14.940 --> 07:20.920
already prophesized. Even a great
poet in your country, William Blake,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.700
has prophesized it. He said these times will
come, when men of God will become prophets

07:29.160 --> 07:34.420
and these prophets will have power to make
others prophets. I mean nobody could be more

07:34.500 --> 07:41.500
precise than Blake, I tell you. He was so great
to say this will happen and this is what we have

07:41.580 --> 07:47.760
to expect. when we go to anybody for seeking.
Have we become prophets? And what is a prophet?

07:48.360 --> 07:55.260
Prophet is a person who is a collective being
and who knows all about it, who is the master.

07:56.400 --> 08:03.400
We call prophet a master. And that’s what you
have to become: The master! And that mastery

08:03.480 --> 08:12.220
is very simple because it’s all built within you
just it has to be connected. Like anything like a

08:12.300 --> 08:16.300
television set is to be connected to the mains,
it’s all built in, it’s there, it just starts

08:16.380 --> 08:23.380
working. In the same way you are that, you are
that. Just it is to be connected. Whatever may

08:23.460 --> 08:31.300
be your caste, community, race, nationality,
shapes, heights – anything whatever you may be,

08:31.380 --> 08:36.780
makes no difference because all of you have
got this great thing within you, this power

08:37.440 --> 08:44.206
of a rebirth and you are to be born again,
and you will be born again. Why not today?
