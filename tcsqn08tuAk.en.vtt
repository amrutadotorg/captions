WEBVTT

00:35.405 --> 00:41.952
Shri Mataji (in Hindi: Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is a little sick

00:41.954 --> 00:50.982
and I stayed back to make her better.

00:52.956 --> 00:56.562
First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

00:59.910 --> 01:10.460
Today we are going to worship Rajalakshmi,

01:11.548 --> 01:21.111
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

01:25.905 --> 01:32.541
It’s a very important thing today to understand

01:33.764 --> 01:38.267
that something has basically gone wrong

01:38.501 --> 01:46.856
in the working of our political systems

01:49.298 --> 02:01.063
and why the people have lost their sense of

02:03.834 --> 02:11.821
justice, fair play and the benevolence of the people.

02:12.071 --> 02:19.696
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

02:21.921 --> 02:32.859
It’s not only in India, it’s not only in Japan or in England

02:32.860 --> 02:41.923
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

02:51.383 --> 02:59.353
First and foremost thing is that all these countries,

02:59.553 --> 03:04.453
even those who have got their freedom,

03:04.453 --> 03:07.802
started following those countries

03:07.804 --> 03:12.822
which were supposed to be highty and mighty and very powerful

03:12.823 --> 03:20.259
– like America, like Russia, like China, England –

03:23.824 --> 03:29.997
without understanding how far they have reached

03:30.006 --> 03:36.516
in delivering the goods that they are supposed to do.

03:39.210 --> 03:43.859
In any case, in a country like England,

03:44.445 --> 03:49.125
you see the monarchy, the way it has been working,

03:49.265 --> 03:54.703
is shocking, absolutely shocking.

03:56.445 --> 04:04.992
The way they have acted towards their ministers, like Cromwell,

04:06.820 --> 04:14.622
you feel as if some primitive people are trying to manage something.

04:14.820 --> 04:19.083
And the kings so cruel, queens so cruel,

04:19.312 --> 04:24.492
so character-less, so irresponsible.

04:24.507 --> 04:33.031
They had no character to be kings and queens.

04:37.023 --> 04:45.417
There was no surrendering to the Rajalakshmi principle of one’s being.

04:47.613 --> 04:51.101
Then of course, it became independent,

04:51.117 --> 04:57.250
and even now I find such stupid things they’re doing.

04:57.500 --> 05:05.490
Even in France the president has a keep,

05:06.553 --> 05:11.078
they run after money, little money here and there.

05:11.585 --> 05:18.920
There are people in every country who are really of very, very low level

05:18.922 --> 05:27.770
and who are trying to look after the welfare of the people.

05:31.007 --> 05:33.922
Also if you read the history of Samurai

05:33.922 --> 05:37.968
and all those people in Japan you are shocked.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.512
They thought no end of themselves,

05:39.514 --> 05:44.913
they had no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

05:44.680 --> 05:50.990
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

05:50.859 --> 05:56.513
There also those who came in power

05:56.515 --> 06:03.430
became really like despotic rulers.

06:03.430 --> 06:07.499
Then we have on the other side Mr. Hitler

06:07.501 --> 06:11.427
who came, thinking no end of himself.

06:11.429 --> 06:17.828
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

06:19.639 --> 06:24.640
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

06:24.734 --> 06:30.740
without any higher qualities than the rest of the people

06:30.742 --> 06:34.249
can look after their well-being.

06:34.251 --> 06:37.883
It’s impossible!

06:43.031 --> 06:49.989
I should say in our own country we had great kings, very great,

06:49.989 --> 06:54.734
because our heritage is great

06:54.759 --> 07:00.429
and we had saints who really ruled the kings.

07:00.710 --> 07:08.930
Like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

07:08.930 --> 07:11.790
Janaka had a guru.

07:11.790 --> 07:15.340
Everybody had a guru.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.920
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.430
But they were real gurus!

07:21.430 --> 07:26.519
They were the people who really lived the life of saints,

07:26.519 --> 07:33.060
they were real saints, inside, outside.

07:33.060 --> 07:47.489
And the people also accepted the kings who had spiritual background.

07:47.489 --> 07:49.910
Those who respected spiritual people.

07:49.910 --> 07:58.970
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different

07:58.970 --> 08:01.900
till sometime.

08:01.900 --> 08:10.260
I don’t know when the English came what happened to them.

08:10.260 --> 08:12.720
The majority of the people didn’t like

08:12.720 --> 08:19.780
the way the English were living, their style, their methods,

08:19.780 --> 08:22.389
they didn’t appreciate.

08:22.389 --> 08:26.910
But these king and queens of different states

08:26.910 --> 08:32.320
they started feeling that they are very sophisticated people

08:32.320 --> 08:35.160
and we should have their culture.

08:35.160 --> 08:39.170
And so many of these queens, modern ones,

08:39.170 --> 08:47.060
who smoke, who drink, tell Me that it was taught by their governess

08:47.060 --> 08:57.440
who came either from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.420
And they picked up these things.

09:00.420 --> 09:04.170
Of course the men also thought that we are very backward, you see,

09:04.170 --> 09:07.150
that’s the idea they gave them, “You are very backward people,

09:07.150 --> 09:12.020
you don’t know how to smoke, you don’t know how to drink,

09:12.020 --> 09:14.930
you have no ballroom dancing,” this that.

09:14.930 --> 09:19.360
Even our military got corrupted with it.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.990
In the military

09:21.990 --> 09:24.990
is all English style things still going on.

09:24.990 --> 09:27.630
I don’t know when will they stop.

09:27.630 --> 09:30.490
They don’t know anything about our own country.

09:30.490 --> 09:33.460
They’ll know about England,

09:33.460 --> 09:37.120
and you ask them anything about England they’ll know.

09:37.120 --> 09:42.160
The whole education system came through English,

09:42.160 --> 09:49.190
but all about England and western life than about Indian life.

09:49.190 --> 09:55.080
Nobody ever cared for Indian things, you see.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.300
Even in medicine same thing happened.

09:58.300 --> 10:02.790
Nobody wanted to listen to any vaidya (ayurveda) or anyone.

10:02.790 --> 10:12.610
They thought “Oh, these are useless primitive people, backward!”

10:12.610 --> 10:16.750
So even one country, which was really, I should say,

10:16.750 --> 10:29.630
had spirituality ruling in the politics also went down like this.

10:29.630 --> 10:35.150
Before independence in this country, I remember,

10:35.150 --> 10:39.770
we had to fight the British,

10:39.770 --> 10:45.830
and what patriotism people had at that time.

10:45.830 --> 10:51.420
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

10:51.420 --> 10:55.900
and My father always had a national flag on it,

10:55.900 --> 10:59.260
that time it was not national it was congress flag, in the car.

10:59.260 --> 11:02.820
So the soldiers came, they said, “Take down this flag!”

11:02.820 --> 11:05.970
So My driver got down he said,

11:05.970 --> 11:10.290
“You cut my throat first and then you take down the flag!”.

11:10.290 --> 11:21.680
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

11:21.680 --> 11:27.120
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism came at that time

11:27.120 --> 11:36.800
when we were fighting these people.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.320
But they divided us and created a problem for us.

11:40.320 --> 11:46.480
And you know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

11:46.480 --> 11:54.050
we were fighting, we were divided.

11:54.050 --> 11:58.590
I don’t know whom to blame for that.

11:58.590 --> 12:01.940
If we had not accepted this division,

12:01.940 --> 12:06.800
there would have been no problem.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.010
But they accepted it.

12:08.010 --> 12:11.570
Now, poor Bangladeshi’s are so, so, so poor.

12:11.570 --> 12:19.200
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.280
And what is Pakistan?

12:20.280 --> 12:23.050
It’s just an empty place, you know,

12:23.050 --> 12:24.900
no industries, nothing.

12:24.900 --> 12:29.390
That’s why they are all the time talking about Kashmir, Kashmir.

12:29.390 --> 12:30.820
They have nothing else!

12:30.820 --> 12:37.690
[In] their own country people are having fights, this that, but there’s no growth.

12:37.690 --> 12:41.390
Now they cut out only this India.

12:41.390 --> 12:52.640
Now here, after all this happening, you know, any war,

12:52.640 --> 12:59.910
any kind of crisis like that, immediately changes the value system.

12:59.910 --> 13:03.700
Not that in the West there were no value systems, there were,

13:03.700 --> 13:11.730
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

13:11.730 --> 13:17.310
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,

13:17.310 --> 13:25.920
or those who stood for something good were regarded as no ideal.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.790
And people took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

13:30.790 --> 13:34.590
and they became very self-centred,

13:34.590 --> 13:38.830
only worried about their own personal things, their families,

13:38.830 --> 13:45.620
or maybe accumulation of money and

13:45.620 --> 13:48.240
transferring of money from here to Switzerland.

13:48.240 --> 13:53.280
I mean something, I mean I tell you I’ve gone through My life

13:53.280 --> 13:58.310
with the people who were fighting, fighting for freedom.

13:58.310 --> 14:04.770
I mean they could not even think of these things.

14:04.770 --> 14:08.410
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends,

14:08.410 --> 14:13.610
I know so many people who were in our family used to come,

14:13.610 --> 14:19.880
so many Sikhs and so many other people, Muslims even.

14:19.880 --> 14:25.980
They could not think of taking any money,

14:25.980 --> 14:32.310
I mean it was really regarded as very low-level.

14:32.310 --> 14:41.700
For what to take?

14:41.700 --> 14:46.020
What is the need?

14:46.020 --> 14:51.730
If you are satisfied in your heart of what you wanted, you got,

14:51.730 --> 14:54.820
you’ve got your freedom, now finished.

14:54.820 --> 15:00.480
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

15:00.480 --> 15:04.140
who did nothing for the country,

15:04.140 --> 15:07.180
sacrificed nothing for the country,

15:07.180 --> 15:16.190
just came up on top and all the good people went down.

15:16.190 --> 15:23.760
If you read the history of Shivaji,

15:23.760 --> 15:28.890
or Rana Pratap, or any of them, Shalivahana, anyone,

15:28.890 --> 15:35.820
you’ll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.

15:35.820 --> 15:41.740
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

15:41.740 --> 15:45.630
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

15:45.630 --> 15:49.770
Up to the point till the dharma was there.

15:49.770 --> 15:53.280
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

15:53.280 --> 16:00.390
But in the subtle way, one feels that

16:00.390 --> 16:07.800
this partition suddenly changed the attitude of people,

16:07.800 --> 16:15.400
or I should say those who were very low-level they came up.

16:15.400 --> 16:22.100
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

16:22.100 --> 16:31.910
and I was married and three people came to Me.

16:31.910 --> 16:35.050
I was sitting outside in the garden,

16:35.050 --> 16:37.830
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

16:37.830 --> 16:43.660
So they came, and they looked at Me and they said,

16:43.660 --> 16:49.660
“Can we have one room in your house?”

16:49.660 --> 16:51.960
I said, “Why not, I’ve got it.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.560
It’s a very big house of My father.

16:54.560 --> 16:59.070
I’ll give it to you.”

16:59.070 --> 17:03.380
They said, “We need for one or two months.

17:03.380 --> 17:04.380
We are refugees.”

17:04.380 --> 17:05.380
I said “Alright, and it has an outside door,

17:05.380 --> 17:08.460
you need not bother us and there’s also kitchen attached

17:08.460 --> 17:09.760
and a bathroom attached.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.549
You can do whatever you like.”

17:12.549 --> 17:15.430
Just I offered.

17:15.430 --> 17:20.640
In the evening My brother came, elder brother, and My husband

17:20.640 --> 17:27.490
and both of them were friends and he just started shouting at Me.

17:27.490 --> 17:28.930
These people were in the other room.

17:28.930 --> 17:31.590
“What do you mean by keeping such people?

17:31.590 --> 17:32.590
Who are they?

17:32.590 --> 17:35.130
What will they do?” and this and that.

17:35.130 --> 17:38.910
I said, “What will they do?”

17:38.910 --> 17:41.170
“They may steal something from me!”

17:41.170 --> 17:44.480
“So what is there in this house to steal?

17:44.480 --> 17:50.540
They are refugees, look nice people to Me.

17:50.540 --> 17:54.490
I have approved them because of vibrations they’re alright.”

17:54.490 --> 17:58.080
“No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!”

17:58.080 --> 18:02.300
I said, Look at these people [my husband and brother],

18:02.300 --> 18:06.530
“Without even talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

18:06.530 --> 18:14.610
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees.”

18:14.610 --> 18:19.980
Then I did feel that in this country a new wave had started,

18:19.980 --> 18:26.070
that a person is not respected if he has no money,

18:26.070 --> 18:30.400
he’s not trusted if you have no money.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.840
Actually it is the other way round,

18:32.840 --> 18:36.430
those who have money, you better never trust them.

18:36.430 --> 18:39.980
And those who don’t have money are much more honest people

18:39.980 --> 18:43.330
in this country than the people who have money,

18:43.330 --> 18:49.170
who are all cheats practically.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.440
So it happened like this and I said,

18:52.440 --> 18:54.380
“No they are going to stay here!”

18:54.380 --> 18:57.030
I put down My foot.

18:57.030 --> 19:02.130
I said, “This house My father has given Me

19:02.130 --> 19:04.490
and they are going to stay here.”

19:04.490 --> 19:11.700
Poor things they stayed for a month in a very,

19:11.700 --> 19:16.800
I think, must be very much embarrassed.

19:16.800 --> 19:21.910
And while they were there so many Sikhs,

19:21.910 --> 19:26.640
that time it was a big organisation – Sikhs and RSS were one,

19:26.640 --> 19:29.330
and they came to My house and said,

19:29.330 --> 19:31.760
“We’ve heard there’s a Muslim staying with you.”

19:31.760 --> 19:33.160
There was a Muslim.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.390
“And we’re going to kill that Muslim.”

19:36.390 --> 19:41.170
I said, “What makes you think there’s a Muslim?”

19:41.170 --> 19:42.770
“We’ve got reports.”

19:42.770 --> 19:47.550
I said, “Wrong, there’s no Muslim in the house.”

19:47.550 --> 19:53.400
I told him a lie.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.310
So they said, “How are we to believe you?”

19:57.310 --> 20:00.900
I said, “See I’m wearing a thing (bindi).

20:00.900 --> 20:02.760
I am a Hindu lady.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.650
How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

20:04.650 --> 20:11.620
We’re all frightened of them and there’s no one like that.”

20:11.620 --> 20:13.960
Somehow or other they believed Me.

20:13.960 --> 20:18.140
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

20:18.140 --> 20:26.680
They had brought lots of those swords, with blood.

20:26.680 --> 20:36.590
But I was not afraid and I told them in a very determined manner.

20:36.590 --> 20:39.200
Anybody else in My place would have said,

20:39.200 --> 20:48.120
“Alright, alright there is one you can take away.”

20:48.120 --> 20:54.400
Then these three persons, who were there, left My house

20:54.400 --> 20:59.950
and one of them is a very famous actress,

20:59.950 --> 21:03.120
another one is a very famous poet

21:03.120 --> 21:06.870
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

21:06.870 --> 21:10.220
And it so happened that

21:10.220 --> 21:16.130
they (a charitable organisation) wanted to make a film about young people

21:16.130 --> 21:22.200
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

21:22.200 --> 21:24.370
and they wanted to call this actress.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.810
I said, “Don’t tell her My name.”

21:27.810 --> 21:31.040
Because I had lost her completely.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.600
I’d just said let it be wherever they are, let them be.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.520
There’s no, sort of, I never made any enquiries or anything.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.750
“Don’t tell them My name.”

21:38.750 --> 21:39.750
They said “Why?”

21:39.750 --> 21:48.210
I said, “For some reason you just don’t tell her My name,

21:48.210 --> 21:51.490
otherwise she’ll be compelled to say yes, which I don’t want.”

21:51.490 --> 21:54.700
So when they went to her and asked her,

21:54.700 --> 21:58.980
she said, “I must get a sari, I must get a chappal,

21:58.980 --> 22:02.410
I must get a purse to match, I must get this,

22:02.410 --> 22:05.120
all this you have to pay, plus so much money you’ll have to pay.”

22:05.120 --> 22:07.280
They said, “Ours is a charitable.”

22:07.280 --> 22:09.810
She said, “Whatever it is.”

22:09.810 --> 22:14.370
I said, “Alright, give her whatever she asks for.”

22:14.370 --> 22:20.210
Then I went for the opening ceremony and she saw Me

22:20.210 --> 22:25.420
and she couldn’t control herself, tears started rolling down her.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.490
Just came and fell at My feet.

22:27.490 --> 22:33.410
She said, “How are you here after such a long time?”

22:33.410 --> 22:37.480
So they said, “She’s the one who’s making this film.”

22:37.480 --> 22:38.480
“What?

22:38.480 --> 22:44.960
She’s making this film, why didn’t you tell me?

22:44.960 --> 22:45.960
My God, my God.”

22:45.960 --> 22:48.990
She couldn’t help it, she was crying, crying, crying, crying.

22:48.990 --> 22:50.540
I said, “Now it’s alright.”

22:50.540 --> 22:52.760
She said, “You take money from me.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.360
I’ll pay for the whole making of the film.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.100
You don’t know this lady.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.490
You don’t know her.

22:58.490 --> 23:02.910
What She’s done for me, nobody would do [what] she had done.”

23:02.910 --> 23:09.330
She said, “She never told us anything how are we to know?”

23:09.330 --> 23:12.980
Such a change that she, immediately she telephoned to her husband

23:12.980 --> 23:16.980
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all…

23:16.980 --> 23:24.720
But a small good gesture of administration:

23:24.720 --> 23:31.170
that was My house given to Me by My father.

23:31.170 --> 23:34.940
That time of course My husband and My brother

23:34.940 --> 23:42.820
didn’t know how to trust people.

23:42.820 --> 23:45.210
But I trusted them, fully.

23:45.210 --> 23:50.590
They were saying, “They will cut your throat.”

23:50.590 --> 23:51.590
“Why?

23:51.590 --> 23:53.900
Why will they cut My throat?

23:53.900 --> 23:57.080
For what?”

23:57.080 --> 23:59.680
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.880
And the worst thing I felt was

24:02.880 --> 24:10.600
they were afraid because they had no money.

24:10.600 --> 24:15.730
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

24:15.730 --> 24:22.160
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

24:22.160 --> 24:27.120
Without money people started suffering very much.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.990
Poor people don’t mind because they are used to it.

24:30.990 --> 24:35.730
Whatever money they have, they eat it and sleep off.

24:35.730 --> 24:40.550
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

24:40.550 --> 24:43.680
but they were poor people no doubt.

24:43.680 --> 24:47.720
But what I realised at that moment,

24:47.720 --> 24:53.880
that the people who have any position or any power or anything

24:53.880 --> 25:02.640
are literally frightened of everybody else.

25:02.640 --> 25:07.290
This is the beginning of our downfall.

25:07.290 --> 25:13.090
We got frightened.

25:13.090 --> 25:17.180
Those who were in charge got frightened

25:17.180 --> 25:26.390
that I may lose my seat or I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

25:26.390 --> 25:31.720
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

25:31.720 --> 25:37.770
Supposing I am left with no money.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.500
So what?

25:39.500 --> 25:41.230
What happens?

25:41.230 --> 25:48.240
All these thoughts started coming after that partition, I felt it’s everywhere.

25:48.240 --> 25:53.460
While I’ll tell you in My childhood,

25:53.460 --> 25:56.190
My father never used to lock the house, it was a very big house

25:56.190 --> 25:58.430
he never use to lock.

25:58.430 --> 26:00.450
And we had a very beautiful gramophone

26:00.450 --> 26:04.630
will all that horn sort of a thing.

26:04.630 --> 26:11.550
And one day one thief came and stole that.

26:11.550 --> 26:16.480
So next day we discovered, My father said,

26:16.480 --> 26:21.060
“Poor thing, he was fond of music so he’s taken away doesn’t matter,

26:21.060 --> 26:24.900
but he didn’t take the records now what will he use,

26:24.900 --> 26:27.460
he must have records.”

26:27.460 --> 26:29.111
So My Mother started teasing him,

26:29.111 --> 26:31.240
“Alright you advertise now.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.360
The one who has stolen our gramophone

26:34.360 --> 26:39.350
should come and take the records they are available for him.”

26:39.350 --> 26:42.590
It’s so natural you know.

26:42.590 --> 26:45.770
He just felt [that] we have money after all,

26:45.770 --> 26:48.230
this fellow doesn’t have money

26:48.230 --> 26:54.870
and he wants to listen to music you see.

26:54.870 --> 26:57.790
So My father said, ‘Alright’.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.270
Otherwise he was a criminal lawyer

26:59.270 --> 27:02.460
My father knew law very well.

27:02.460 --> 27:05.240
Was not a stupid fool

27:05.240 --> 27:11.190
but he couldn’t understand this fellow has only taken gramophone only

27:11.190 --> 27:12.470
without the records.

27:12.470 --> 27:13.470
He said,

27:13.470 --> 27:17.680
“he must not have found it, you see it was there kept and all that.”

27:17.680 --> 27:24.340
My Mother said, “You better advertise it.”

27:24.340 --> 27:28.290
He was a politician also.

27:28.290 --> 27:34.740
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

27:34.740 --> 27:38.740
how to raise the standard of these people

27:38.740 --> 27:47.659
who are not having what we are having.

27:47.659 --> 27:56.170
All the people who had money donated lavishly to so many things.

27:56.170 --> 28:01.080
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Lakshminarayan,

28:01.080 --> 28:08.630
he donated all his money, everything, to a big university.

28:08.630 --> 28:11.930
Most of the things that happened in those days

28:11.930 --> 28:16.160
were done by charity people.

28:16.160 --> 28:19.500
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

28:19.500 --> 28:22.220
crores and crores and crores.

28:22.220 --> 28:24.950
They never thought like that.

28:24.950 --> 28:30.960
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

28:30.960 --> 28:33.850
and do something good for others.

28:33.850 --> 28:40.360
So when the Rajalakshmi, Lakshmi that is the one responsible

28:40.360 --> 28:45.080
for looking after the benevolence of the people,

28:45.080 --> 28:51.310
when She acts people think that they have,

28:51.310 --> 28:54.800
not even think, they do it, automatically,

28:54.800 --> 28:59.370
that they are there for benevolence.

28:59.370 --> 29:02.380
They don’t have to tell themselves,

29:02.380 --> 29:08.190
it’s just that they feel that it is their job,

29:08.190 --> 29:11.990
this is what they have to do, is to look after the people

29:11.990 --> 29:17.040
they are to be brought to better levels of life.

29:17.040 --> 29:23.610
This is what they think, they don’t think like a party politics,

29:23.610 --> 29:33.690
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind!

29:33.690 --> 29:37.540
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi,

29:37.540 --> 29:47.520
which rules the political side we can say, the kingdoms and all that

29:47.520 --> 29:54.980
– first thing is generosity, first thing is generosity.

29:54.980 --> 30:02.880
For example, Mahavira was meditating and while coming out His cloth

30:02.880 --> 30:06.670
– He had one cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

30:06.670 --> 30:15.090
And the upper cloth just got caught up in the bushes.

30:15.090 --> 30:17.480
So he cut it out and came out with half the cloth

30:17.480 --> 30:20.270
– it was in His own palace.

30:20.270 --> 30:25.440
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

30:25.440 --> 30:30.330
He said, “See I have no clothes, I’m just naked.”

30:30.330 --> 30:33.960
He came before Him like a beggar.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.560
“You have this, why don’t you give Me this cloth?

30:37.560 --> 30:40.650
You can go to your palace and wear your dress.”

30:40.650 --> 30:41.870
He said, “Alright.”

30:41.870 --> 30:48.580
He took it out and gave it to him.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.390
And then He got some leaves and all that, covered Himself,

30:52.390 --> 30:54.380
went to His palace and got dressed.

30:54.380 --> 31:01.460
But now these Jains, you know, they make His statue so big,

31:01.460 --> 31:03.330
insult Him completely

31:03.330 --> 31:17.200
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

31:17.200 --> 31:26.279
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

31:26.279 --> 31:28.690
Goddess is Shri Shobha!

31:28.690 --> 31:33.520
She’s the One who decorates you.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.920
She’s a mother.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.510
She decorates you with ornaments,

31:38.510 --> 31:41.560
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She’s your mother.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.740
She does it!

31:44.740 --> 31:52.010
Like, Raja Janaka, He was the king so

31:52.010 --> 32:00.149
He had to wear ornaments, He had to wear beautiful clothes,

32:00.149 --> 32:01.700
He had to do everything.

32:01.700 --> 32:02.700
And when Nachiketa went to Him

32:02.700 --> 32:06.980
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to this king

32:06.980 --> 32:10.350
who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that and

32:10.350 --> 32:14.100
he also had a big function of dancing and this.

32:14.100 --> 32:19.930
He said, “He’s not a saint so why my guru touches His feet?

32:19.930 --> 32:24.860
He’s a king.”

32:24.860 --> 32:32.740
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

32:32.740 --> 32:34.950
He said, “Why have you come here Nachiketa?”

32:34.950 --> 32:38.600
He said, “I’m here to get my Self-realisation.”

32:38.600 --> 32:42.960
He said, “You can take all My kingdom

32:42.960 --> 32:46.550
but not easy to give you Self-realisation.”

32:46.550 --> 32:53.560
He said, “Alright, whatever you say I’ll do.”

32:53.560 --> 33:01.700
So He put a big sword on his head and asked him to sleep.

33:01.700 --> 33:07.630
He couldn’t sleep at all.

33:07.630 --> 33:09.090
Then they were having a bath,

33:09.090 --> 33:11.770
he said, “Come and have bath in the river.”

33:11.770 --> 33:18.090
People came and told that there’s fire and everybody’s running away

33:18.090 --> 33:20.180
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood,

33:20.180 --> 33:22.880
He was just sitting quietly.

33:22.880 --> 33:25.580
Nachiketa got a little upset.

33:25.580 --> 33:27.890
Then they said, “The fire is coming here

33:27.890 --> 33:30.659
and all these cloths are going to be burnt.”

33:30.659 --> 33:40.990
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still He was meditating.

33:40.990 --> 33:45.810
Then they came out and Nachiketa found

33:45.810 --> 33:49.279
that nothing that was burnt was there.

33:49.279 --> 33:53.210
It was just an illusion for people.

33:53.210 --> 33:58.240
He was amazed.

33:58.240 --> 34:02.779
Then he realised what was wrong with him,

34:02.779 --> 34:08.630
that he was doubting the Divine power Itself.

34:08.630 --> 34:13.890
The one who was Janaka, who was a king,

34:13.890 --> 34:17.840
was not bothered about His own powers, these are what?

34:17.840 --> 34:20.870
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

34:20.870 --> 34:25.320
Because I’m married, I have to wear a mangalsutra.

34:25.320 --> 34:30.140
So this is for the parampara, for the tradition style,

34:30.140 --> 34:46.100
but inside He was a saint, a very high…high level of saintliness.

34:46.100 --> 34:56.900
When this thing happens that you get some position,

34:56.900 --> 35:01.600
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

35:01.600 --> 35:09.230
If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him.

35:09.230 --> 35:10.230
It is a myth.

35:10.230 --> 35:13.080
There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.660
It’s just a myth.

35:16.660 --> 35:24.330
But suddenly people jump up.

35:24.330 --> 35:30.719
It is ego that gets pampered.

35:30.719 --> 35:40.230
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rajalakshmi.

35:40.230 --> 35:43.840
She is the giver of balance.

35:43.840 --> 35:58.600
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

35:58.600 --> 36:02.260
Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant,

36:02.260 --> 36:07.450
I have done it, it’s not easy.

36:07.450 --> 36:10.080
Without fear.

36:10.080 --> 36:23.200
And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.

36:23.200 --> 36:28.520
And Her blessings are tremendous.

36:28.520 --> 36:43.840
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity.

36:43.840 --> 36:49.300
Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen.

36:49.300 --> 36:57.820
You are a queen, so you can’t behave like street women.

36:57.820 --> 37:08.000
With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity.

37:08.000 --> 37:17.480
That dignity is full of love, love for others.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.870
That personality emits nothing

37:19.870 --> 37:26.930
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

37:26.930 --> 37:35.280
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

37:35.280 --> 37:38.290
She doesn’t expect anything.

37:38.290 --> 37:43.660
She is a queen, what can you give to the queen?

37:43.660 --> 37:48.220
She’s the highest of all in every way,

37:48.220 --> 37:49.890
what can you give it to Her?

37:49.890 --> 37:54.150
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents

37:54.150 --> 37:55.370
of all these countries are beggars.

37:55.370 --> 38:02.510
All the time give me this, give me this,

38:02.510 --> 38:05.910
like greedy people going around are beggars!

38:05.910 --> 38:13.350
They are not the people who can rule.

38:13.350 --> 38:19.780
Hankering after things.

38:19.780 --> 38:26.400
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality

38:26.400 --> 38:33.469
that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

38:33.469 --> 38:39.390
cares for each and every person who comes along.

38:39.390 --> 38:49.090
This is a blessing of the Goddess.

38:49.090 --> 38:53.430
Then the second blessing of the Goddess

38:53.430 --> 39:00.090
is that you develop a kind of a temperament,

39:00.090 --> 39:09.020
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

39:09.020 --> 39:15.160
and understanding what other people are like.

39:15.160 --> 39:20.770
There’s a story of a king who was going on a horse

39:20.770 --> 39:21.900
and he met a drunkard.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.250
So you can say

39:24.250 --> 39:28.990
these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

39:28.990 --> 39:32.490
So the drunkard stopped.

39:32.490 --> 39:36.380
He said, “I want to buy your horse.”

39:36.380 --> 39:38.980
People said, “Do you know what he is?”

39:38.980 --> 39:40.790
“Yeah I know he’s a king.

39:40.790 --> 39:41.790
Alright.

39:41.790 --> 39:42.790
So what?

39:42.790 --> 39:43.790
I want to buy his horse.”

39:43.790 --> 39:48.970
He said, “Alright not today, tomorrow we’ll sell the horse to you.”

39:48.970 --> 39:50.030
So went away.

39:50.030 --> 39:51.800
Next day he was called.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.780
So he came with folded hands bent down.

39:55.780 --> 40:00.960
He said, “What, you were the one who was going to buy my horse,

40:00.960 --> 40:02.660
what has happened to you?

40:02.660 --> 40:06.110
I want to sell it to you.”

40:06.110 --> 40:14.500
He said, “Sir, the one who wanted to buy is dead.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.230
I am an ordinary person.”

40:17.230 --> 40:38.370
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

40:38.370 --> 40:41.850
that anybody would have been angry, would have said

40:41.850 --> 40:42.890
“Beat this man!

40:42.890 --> 40:43.920
Throw him away!

40:43.920 --> 40:45.670
He talks to me like this,

40:45.670 --> 40:52.690
behaves like this.”

40:52.690 --> 40:58.320
What the king said was remarkable.

40:58.320 --> 41:07.209
Because he knew he’s drunk, he knew he’s not in his senses,

41:07.209 --> 41:12.130
that’s why he’s talking.

41:12.130 --> 41:14.090
Didn’t get angry with him,

41:14.090 --> 41:17.130
he said, “Alright, come along tomorrow, I’ll sell you the horse.”

41:17.130 --> 41:21.160
That’s only possible if you have this Rajalakshmi in you

41:21.160 --> 41:24.730
otherwise you would never behave like this.

41:24.730 --> 41:31.020
Now what about today’s politicians anywhere?

41:31.020 --> 41:35.010
They even shoot people, they kill people,

41:35.010 --> 41:37.300
they arrest them,they put them into trouble I mean,

41:37.300 --> 41:50.930
all kinds of things they are doing.

41:50.930 --> 41:58.250
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals!

41:58.250 --> 42:00.970
But we accept!

42:00.970 --> 42:05.719
As in Hindi we say, “Aaj kal ka zamana hai aisa.”

42:05.719 --> 42:07.540
(Such is todays world)

42:07.540 --> 42:16.430
We accept it – all such people as our rulers.

42:16.430 --> 42:23.780
Then Rajalakshmi is the one who stands on dharma.

42:23.780 --> 42:25.810
She stands on dharma.

42:25.810 --> 42:38.230
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

42:38.230 --> 42:46.130
Adharmi is to be taken out.

42:46.130 --> 42:58.670
But if he’s not, then he will go all out to save that person.

42:58.670 --> 43:06.240
But if he finds he’s adharmi, he will not.

43:06.240 --> 43:13.630
Is a kind of a divine discretion he should have

43:13.630 --> 43:21.690
as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

43:21.690 --> 43:27.840
That divine discretion should be there in a person,

43:27.840 --> 43:31.130
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people

43:31.130 --> 43:42.020
who are around you, teaching you something, doing something.

43:42.020 --> 43:48.760
One day I was in My mother’s place Nandgaon,

43:48.760 --> 43:53.720
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.340
I just kept quiet.

43:55.340 --> 44:04.090
He was a big politician and he told Me,

44:04.090 --> 44:08.520
“We have to do like this and we have to do.”

44:08.520 --> 44:10.380
I said, “Alright, alright, alright.”

44:10.380 --> 44:16.490
Then three, four professors from the university came to tell Me,

44:16.490 --> 44:20.280
“Mother, he’s a politician, be very careful.

44:20.280 --> 44:23.900
He’s a very bad man, you be careful about him.”

44:23.900 --> 44:26.320
I said, “What do you know about him?”

44:26.320 --> 44:28.190
They said, “He’s a politician.”

44:28.190 --> 44:30.090
I said, “There are so many politicians.”

44:30.090 --> 44:31.710
“But he’s not a good man.”

44:31.710 --> 44:33.890
“But what do you mean?”

44:33.890 --> 44:36.610
I said, “Now you sit down and I’ll tell you.

44:36.610 --> 44:40.480
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin.

44:40.480 --> 44:48.699
He himself is not a Brahmin and this child is from him to her

44:48.699 --> 44:54.110
and how much he has deceived people everything I know.”

44:54.110 --> 44:55.110
They were shocked.

44:55.110 --> 44:56.110
“You know Mother?”

44:56.110 --> 44:58.450
“Of course.

44:58.450 --> 45:02.470
I know everything!”

45:02.470 --> 45:12.780
“Then why do You allow him to come close to You?”

45:12.780 --> 45:16.310
“Do you think he is close to Me?”

45:16.310 --> 45:21.850
I said, “You are sadly mistaken.

45:21.850 --> 45:26.330
But it’s nice he’s come to Me

45:26.330 --> 45:30.990
because he’s been troubling people too much and I’ll correct him.”

45:30.990 --> 45:35.070
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got,

45:35.070 --> 45:38.110
and some of them came to tell Me be careful of this man

45:38.110 --> 45:45.250
without knowing what he was.

45:45.250 --> 45:50.230
This kind of a divine discretion has to be there.

45:50.230 --> 45:54.290
If a king does not have that divine discretion

45:54.290 --> 46:07.190
then he can punish the good and he may help the bad people.

46:07.190 --> 46:11.260
But this divine discretion disappears when you are self-centred.

46:11.260 --> 46:15.130
That’s the main point, is a complete detachment

46:15.130 --> 46:18.719
about the power should be there.

46:18.719 --> 46:20.630
Complete detachment.

46:20.630 --> 46:23.880
Why should Rajalakshmi care for anything?

46:23.880 --> 46:29.160
What does She get?

46:29.160 --> 46:31.090
But now there are some who’ll pamper a person

46:31.090 --> 46:33.570
this, this and that, and then they feel

46:33.570 --> 46:39.810
“ah, we’re on top of the world!”

46:39.810 --> 46:43.630
They just pamper, pamper and pamper

46:43.630 --> 46:51.080
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man,

46:51.080 --> 46:59.110
then in the election he doesn’t understand why he’s on the ground.

46:59.110 --> 47:09.850
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

47:09.850 --> 47:12.110
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever you may say to Me,

47:12.110 --> 47:16.060
I’ll listen, “Alright, alright, alright”,

47:16.060 --> 47:23.010
but I don’t accept anything as something great.

47:23.010 --> 47:29.420
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

47:29.420 --> 47:35.130
Now supposing this is a lamp here.

47:35.130 --> 47:37.320
So is it great or not great?

47:37.320 --> 47:38.430
It is a lamp.

47:38.430 --> 47:51.730
So if I’m Adi Shakti, I’m Adi Shakti, So what?

47:51.730 --> 47:56.140
If you are a king you are a king so what?

47:56.140 --> 48:00.880
I mean if you are an impostor then you might feel your ego.

48:00.880 --> 48:07.340
But if you are really the king then you won’t feel.

48:07.340 --> 48:14.260
If you are under the influence of the Goddess

48:14.260 --> 48:19.570
then that is the only thing you enjoy.

48:19.570 --> 48:24.480
The rest of it is nothing.

48:24.480 --> 48:29.260
Whether you have diamonds or you have silver

48:29.260 --> 48:40.850
or you have anything makes no difference at all.

48:40.850 --> 48:46.560
Now how people misuse the scriptures also one should see.

48:46.560 --> 48:51.990
That, Rajalakshmi is sitting on the elephant alright,

48:51.990 --> 48:57.110
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

48:57.110 --> 49:03.010
She’s sitting on the elephant because elephant is the highest animal!

49:03.010 --> 49:10.430
Is very kind, very forgiving and has such a tremendous memory.

49:10.430 --> 49:17.500
That’s why She’s sitting on an elephant.

49:17.500 --> 49:24.410
She’s not sitting there to show off.

49:24.410 --> 49:30.890
But She’s sitting there to see around, what is happening

49:30.890 --> 49:39.540
avalokan, She can see around what is happening, to be at a higher place.

49:39.540 --> 49:49.209
That’s why a king is made to sit on a higher pedestal.

49:49.209 --> 49:53.150
But the purpose is not to show off.

49:53.150 --> 49:56.209
But the purpose is

49:56.209 --> 50:02.689
that from that state he can see others better,

50:02.689 --> 50:12.709
he can be watchful of others.

50:12.709 --> 50:15.020
If somebody gets a high position

50:15.020 --> 50:25.350
then they think they are the owners of that position.

50:25.350 --> 50:36.570
This has all come because the brain has gone upside down I think.

50:36.570 --> 50:40.680
How can it be?

50:40.680 --> 50:42.600
Logically?

50:42.600 --> 50:50.469
Now if you are this throne is given, alright, so with the throne

50:50.469 --> 50:58.820
I sit on this, but this throne cannot give Me anything,

50:58.820 --> 51:04.650
I can give something to this throne.

51:04.650 --> 51:08.930
The king has to think he is obliging all these things th

51:08.930 --> 51:13.650
at he is sitting on them because he is a king.

51:13.650 --> 51:18.590
On the contrary he thinks all these things are important because something is lacking

51:18.590 --> 51:22.920
in him or what?

51:22.920 --> 51:26.890
And that’s why when they come to do Raj

51:26.890 --> 51:31.990
they start gathering things which are useless absolutely,

51:31.990 --> 51:39.480
clutter up their houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

51:39.480 --> 51:47.730
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

51:47.730 --> 51:49.709
and to show that they are kings.

51:49.709 --> 51:52.040
Of course they are given a crown,

51:52.040 --> 51:58.380
they are given a big necklace, they are to wear something here

51:58.380 --> 51:59.380
because they are kings.

51:59.380 --> 52:09.130
But these are not actually his decorations

52:09.130 --> 52:15.790
but these things get decorated by a king.

52:15.790 --> 52:21.510
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow from the street,

52:21.510 --> 52:27.860
half starved, who is a beggar, say, for example,

52:27.860 --> 52:35.420
and put those ornaments on him and all the dresses of a king.

52:35.420 --> 52:41.060
Put him on the stage, everybody may start laughing.

52:41.060 --> 52:47.370
Nobody will think that he is a king by any chance,

52:47.370 --> 52:50.570
because he doesn’t have that dignity, doesn’t have that face,

52:50.570 --> 52:52.990
he doesn’t have that body, he doesn’t have that mind,

52:52.990 --> 52:55.980
he doesn’t have that wisdom.

52:55.980 --> 52:59.870
So how is he a king?

52:59.870 --> 53:07.219
Like, there was one king who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

53:07.219 --> 53:09.790
But he’s so stupid looking, you know,

53:09.790 --> 53:13.830
that when I saw the pearls I said,

53:13.830 --> 53:19.110
“This is the man only who can think like this!”

53:19.110 --> 53:22.230
So stupid he was to look at.

53:22.230 --> 53:29.740
And was sure of these pearls being put on his shoes.

53:29.740 --> 53:35.910
So there are many such things these days all of these stupid people are doing.

53:35.910 --> 53:39.500
There are big, big cartoons coming out

53:39.500 --> 53:45.480
and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

53:45.480 --> 53:51.740
To Me it’s such a difference I tell you.

53:51.740 --> 53:52.870
Such a difference.

53:52.870 --> 53:56.700
To them all these things are so important,

53:56.700 --> 54:04.080
which if they don’t have they’ll buy and put it.

54:04.080 --> 54:13.290
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland to our program,

54:13.290 --> 54:21.770
I mean to our dinner, I asked him, “Why are you carrying the garland?”

54:21.770 --> 54:27.120
“See after all you see I was garlanded so I’m keeping the garland.”

54:27.120 --> 54:31.200
We didn’t know what to do!

54:31.200 --> 54:32.820
We Indians will never take a garland,

54:32.820 --> 54:36.760
first of all, anybody gives you they’ll put it, except for the Gods.

54:36.760 --> 54:40.340
They will take it out immediately.

54:40.340 --> 54:42.950
Another lady who came to see Me and she said,

54:42.950 --> 54:44.750
“I don’t understand these Indians,

54:44.750 --> 54:47.590
I bought a garland, I put it in my neck

54:47.590 --> 54:52.940
so they were all laughing on the street at me.”

54:52.940 --> 54:59.670
Now you Indians understand this, how subtle it is, just see,

54:59.670 --> 55:03.220
that you can’t put garland, you are not God.

55:03.220 --> 55:08.000
You cannot buy a garland (laughing) and put it in your neck and walk out.

55:08.000 --> 55:14.330
Innately you have to be that.

55:14.330 --> 55:24.939
So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rajalakshmi.

55:24.939 --> 55:27.840
Then what does She do?

55:27.840 --> 55:30.780
What does She do to such a man?

55:30.780 --> 55:35.380
What She does is first

55:35.380 --> 55:43.230
his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.

55:43.230 --> 55:51.750
She writes it with her own hand.

55:51.750 --> 55:54.330
They adore him,

55:54.330 --> 56:05.700
they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

56:05.700 --> 56:13.070
Another blessing of Rajalakshmi is

56:13.070 --> 56:23.000
that She grants a particular type of a body,

56:23.000 --> 56:31.189
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

56:31.189 --> 56:39.180
They may not be very selfish people

56:39.180 --> 56:42.760
to make a big advertisement about themselves,

56:42.760 --> 56:46.030
talking about themselves, this that.

56:46.030 --> 56:54.760
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

56:54.760 --> 57:02.969
We had many like these in our times also.

57:02.969 --> 57:08.449
Maybe that people didn’t accept them, maybe they are nowhere now,

57:08.449 --> 57:14.060
some new johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

57:14.060 --> 57:19.330
But whatever name is written in the heart of the people,

57:19.330 --> 57:24.439
are the people who are blessed by this Rajalakshmi.

57:24.439 --> 57:27.830
So what a politician has to understand [is]

57:27.830 --> 57:33.420
that he has not to make money,

57:33.420 --> 57:43.010
he does not have to have a big show about himself.

57:43.010 --> 57:49.780
He does not have to do anything that is like

57:49.780 --> 57:54.110
laundering the money from the country.

57:54.110 --> 57:57.141
He does not have to kill others who oppose him,

57:57.141 --> 58:01.360
he doesn’t have to shout at those who trouble them.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.290
But what has he to do?

58:03.290 --> 58:05.710
He has to remember that.

58:05.710 --> 58:14.350
“I am here for the fame of a good man.”

58:14.350 --> 58:21.900
He should worry about the fame he will be leaving after his death.

58:21.900 --> 58:25.780
He should see to it that his fame is safe.

58:25.780 --> 58:38.209
For example, see Shri Rama who was a king of benevolence, no doubt about it.

58:38.209 --> 58:44.320
But His own wife when somebody challenged that

58:44.320 --> 58:49.060
– “She has lived with Ravana and how can She be pure?”

58:49.060 --> 58:55.270
He knew that She was pure, still He decided that He will ask Her to go

58:55.270 --> 59:05.280
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image of a king

59:05.280 --> 59:10.670
and He sent Her away.

59:10.670 --> 59:16.610
But nowadays you find somebody’s brother employed in America,

59:16.610 --> 59:22.490
sister employed there and he has made, his uncle has made a big house

59:22.490 --> 59:25.340
and his wife has accumulated so much money.

59:25.340 --> 59:31.340
It is all going on.

59:31.340 --> 59:34.410
Everybody will talk like that about that person,

59:34.410 --> 59:37.010
that he’s just money oriented,

59:37.010 --> 59:42.040
he just spends money on nonsensical things and he is just exploiting us.

59:42.040 --> 59:49.460
Everybody will talk but nobody will tell him on the face.

59:49.460 --> 59:54.689
So what you have to worry is about absolute correct character.

59:54.689 --> 01:00:00.660
These days this is another point.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.660
Every politician

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.451
must have three, four keeps otherwise he is not a politician.

01:00:03.451 --> 01:00:08.910
Like we had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow

01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:10.140
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.760
He thought if he doesn’t have hundred and sixty five,

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:20.420
people won’t accept him as a Nawab.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.490
So this is another inferiority complex

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:27.380
that you should have some women around you

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:36.010
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:44.380
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:53.660
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody who is not blessed by Rajalakshmi

01:00:53.660 --> 01:01:03.130
will have to go to jail or will have to leave the seat,

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:08.570
will be thrown away or will be as they say,

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.110
“Doubly dying go to the waste, dust”.

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:14.100
It has to be.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:20.860
They’ll be all exposed, whatever tricks they may try.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:33.650
And they will have the consequence of being artificially the rulers.

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:46.020
But a genuineness is the sign that the queen of blessings,

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:54.350
the goddess of Rajalakshmi, is residing in that person.

01:01:54.350 --> 01:02:04.420
In Satya Yuga it will happen I’m sure.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.950
But even in Sahaja Yoga I find people doing politics sometimes,

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.850
I was amazed!

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:17.380
People think politics means keeping groups,

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:23.280
making groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.810
That shows you lack collectivity.

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:36.810
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:43.380
because the power lies in collectivity.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.669
To break the collectivity for anything

01:02:48.669 --> 01:02:57.640
is very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:03.050
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:09.240
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:17.199
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well,

01:03:17.199 --> 01:03:22.270
sit properly, should take up your seats.

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:25.120
You have to be systematic

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.880
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.680
You are not ordinary people.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.700
You are special people.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:42.560
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.949
You are special people,

01:03:45.949 --> 01:03:56.780
so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Rajalakshmi

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.650
that people when they will see you they will vote for you

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:14.890
and tomorrow you will rule the world.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:20.010
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:25.870
but you have to first get the blessings of the Rajalakshmi

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:28.390
and then only you should understand

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:32.620
what’s wrong with our country, what we have to do,

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:40.100
what is the purpose, why do we want to become politicians,

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:45.800
what we have to do, we have to have plans, what is your project.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.940
All these things now put your attention from yourself to outside.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:55.720
Like, that day I received a letter saying,

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:00.010
“my father is sick and my mother is sick then my son is sick,

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:02.920
and this and that and that and that.”

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.110
Such people can’t do much.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.050
When the war of independence started in India

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:13.199
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents, gave up everything,

01:05:13.199 --> 01:05:16.060
we were very young people.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.210
So now you have to know

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:23.510
that if you have to really take to politics

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:25.870
you have to have the blessings of Rajalakshmi

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:30.340
and for that you have to build up yourself

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:34.459
with that dignity, with that sense.

01:05:34.459 --> 01:07:40.850
I bless you from My heart that in every country such

01:07:40.850 --> 01:08:44.029
people

01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:49.379
will come up.

01:08:49.379 --> 01:10:43.819
May God bless you.
