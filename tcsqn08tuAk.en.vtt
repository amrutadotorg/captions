00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:41.952
Shri Mataji (in Hindi: Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is a little sick

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:50.982
and I stayed back to make her better.

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:56.562
First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:10.460
Today we are going to worship Rajalakshmi,

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:21.111
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:32.541
It’s a very important thing today to understand

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:38.267
that something has basically gone wrong

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:46.856
in the working of our political systems

00:01:49.298 --> 00:02:01.063
and why the people have lost their sense of

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:11.821
justice, fair play and the benevolence of the people.

00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:19.696
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:32.859
It’s not only in India, it’s not only in Japan or in England

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.923
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:59.353
First and foremost thing is that all these countries,

00:02:59.553 --> 00:03:04.453
even those who have got their freedom,

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:07.802
started following those countries

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:12.822
which were supposed to be highty and mighty and very powerful

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:20.259
– like America, like Russia, like China, England –

00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:29.997
without understanding how far they have reached

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:36.516
in delivering the goods that they are supposed to do.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.859
In any case, in a country like England,

00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:49.125
you see the monarchy, the way it has been working,

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:54.703
is shocking, absolutely shocking.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:04:04.992
The way they have acted towards their ministers, like Cromwell,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.622
you feel as if some primitive people are trying to manage something.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.083
And the kings so cruel, queens so cruel,

00:04:19.312 --> 00:04:24.492
so character-less, so irresponsible.

00:04:24.507 --> 00:04:33.031
They had no character to be kings and queens.

00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:45.417
There was no surrendering to the Rajalakshmi principle of one’s being.

00:04:47.613 --> 00:04:51.101
Then of course, it became independent,

00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:57.250
and even now I find such stupid things they’re doing.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.490
Even in France the president has a keep,

00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:11.078
they run after money, little money here and there.

00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:18.920
There are people in every country who are really of very, very low level

00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:27.770
and who are trying to look after the welfare of the people.

00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:33.922
Also if you read the history of Samurai

00:05:33.922 --> 00:05:37.968
and all those people in Japan you are shocked.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.512
They thought no end of themselves,

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:44.913
they had no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.990
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:56.513
There also those who came in power

00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:03.430
became really like despotic rulers.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.499
Then we have on the other side Mr. Hitler

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:11.427
who came, thinking no end of himself.

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:17.828
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.640
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:30.740
without any higher qualities than the rest of the people

00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:34.249
can look after their well-being.

00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.883
It’s impossible!

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:49.989
I should say in our own country we had great kings, very great,

00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:54.734
because our heritage is great

00:06:54.759 --> 00:07:00.429
and we had saints who really ruled the kings.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:08.930
Like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.790
Janaka had a guru.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.340
Everybody had a guru.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.920
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.430
But they were real gurus!

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.519
They were the people who really lived the life of saints,

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:33.060
they were real saints, inside, outside.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:47.489
And the people also accepted the kings who had spiritual background.

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:49.910
Those who respected spiritual people.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:58.970
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.900
till sometime.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:10.260
I don’t know when the English came what happened to them.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.720
The majority of the people didn’t like

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.780
the way the English were living, their style, their methods,

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.389
they didn’t appreciate.

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:26.910
But these king and queens of different states

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:32.320
they started feeling that they are very sophisticated people

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.160
and we should have their culture.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.170
And so many of these queens, modern ones,

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:47.060
who smoke, who drink, tell Me that it was taught by their governess

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:57.440
who came either from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.420
And they picked up these things.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.170
Of course the men also thought that we are very backward, you see,

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.150
that’s the idea they gave them, “You are very backward people,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:12.020
you don’t know how to smoke, you don’t know how to drink,

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.930
you have no ballroom dancing,” this that.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.360
Even our military got corrupted with it.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.990
In the military

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.990
is all English style things still going on.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.630
I don’t know when will they stop.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.490
They don’t know anything about our own country.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.460
They’ll know about England,

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.120
and you ask them anything about England they’ll know.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.160
The whole education system came through English,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:49.190
but all about England and western life than about Indian life.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:55.080
Nobody ever cared for Indian things, you see.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.300
Even in medicine same thing happened.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.790
Nobody wanted to listen to any vaidya (ayurveda) or anyone.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:12.610
They thought “Oh, these are useless primitive people, backward!”

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.750
So even one country, which was really, I should say,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:29.630
had spirituality ruling in the politics also went down like this.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:35.150
Before independence in this country, I remember,

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.770
we had to fight the British,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.830
and what patriotism people had at that time.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:51.420
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.900
and My father always had a national flag on it,

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.260
that time it was not national it was congress flag, in the car.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.820
So the soldiers came, they said, “Take down this flag!”

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.970
So My driver got down he said,

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.290
“You cut my throat first and then you take down the flag!”.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:21.680
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.120
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism came at that time

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:36.800
when we were fighting these people.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.320
But they divided us and created a problem for us.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.480
And you know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:54.050
we were fighting, we were divided.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.590
I don’t know whom to blame for that.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.940
If we had not accepted this division,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.800
there would have been no problem.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.010
But they accepted it.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.570
Now, poor Bangladeshi’s are so, so, so poor.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:19.200
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.280
And what is Pakistan?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.050
It’s just an empty place, you know,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.900
no industries, nothing.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.390
That’s why they are all the time talking about Kashmir, Kashmir.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.820
They have nothing else!

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:37.690
[In] their own country people are having fights, this that, but there’s no growth.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.390
Now they cut out only this India.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:52.640
Now here, after all this happening, you know, any war,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.910
any kind of crisis like that, immediately changes the value system.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.700
Not that in the West there were no value systems, there were,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:11.730
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:17.310
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:25.920
or those who stood for something good were regarded as no ideal.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.790
And people took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.590
and they became very self-centred,

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.830
only worried about their own personal things, their families,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:45.620
or maybe accumulation of money and

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.240
transferring of money from here to Switzerland.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.280
I mean something, I mean I tell you I’ve gone through My life

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.310
with the people who were fighting, fighting for freedom.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:04.770
I mean they could not even think of these things.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.410
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends,

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:13.610
I know so many people who were in our family used to come,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:19.880
so many Sikhs and so many other people, Muslims even.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.980
They could not think of taking any money,

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:32.310
I mean it was really regarded as very low-level.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:41.700
For what to take?

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.020
What is the need?

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:51.730
If you are satisfied in your heart of what you wanted, you got,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.820
you’ve got your freedom, now finished.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:00.480
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.140
who did nothing for the country,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.180
sacrificed nothing for the country,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:16.190
just came up on top and all the good people went down.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:23.760
If you read the history of Shivaji,

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.890
or Rana Pratap, or any of them, Shalivahana, anyone,

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:35.820
you’ll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:41.740
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.630
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.770
Up to the point till the dharma was there.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.280
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:00.390
But in the subtle way, one feels that

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:07.800
this partition suddenly changed the attitude of people,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:15.400
or I should say those who were very low-level they came up.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:22.100
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:31.910
and I was married and three people came to Me.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.050
I was sitting outside in the garden,

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.830
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:43.660
So they came, and they looked at Me and they said,

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.660
“Can we have one room in your house?”

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.960
I said, “Why not, I’ve got it.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.560
It’s a very big house of My father.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.070
I’ll give it to you.”

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.380
They said, “We need for one or two months.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.380
We are refugees.”

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.380
I said “Alright, and it has an outside door,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.460
you need not bother us and there’s also kitchen attached

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.760
and a bathroom attached.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.549
You can do whatever you like.”

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:15.430
Just I offered.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:20.640
In the evening My brother came, elder brother, and My husband

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:27.490
and both of them were friends and he just started shouting at Me.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.930
These people were in the other room.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.590
“What do you mean by keeping such people?

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.590
Who are they?

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.130
What will they do?” and this and that.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.910
I said, “What will they do?”

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.170
“They may steal something from me!”

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.480
“So what is there in this house to steal?

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.540
They are refugees, look nice people to Me.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.490
I have approved them because of vibrations they’re alright.”

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.080
“No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!”

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.300
I said, Look at these people [my husband and brother],

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.530
“Without even talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:14.610
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees.”

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.980
Then I did feel that in this country a new wave had started,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:26.070
that a person is not respected if he has no money,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.400
he’s not trusted if you have no money.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.840
Actually it is the other way round,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.430
those who have money, you better never trust them.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.980
And those who don’t have money are much more honest people

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.330
in this country than the people who have money,

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:49.170
who are all cheats practically.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.440
So it happened like this and I said,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.380
“No they are going to stay here!”

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.030
I put down My foot.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:02.130
I said, “This house My father has given Me

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.490
and they are going to stay here.”

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:11.700
Poor things they stayed for a month in a very,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.800
I think, must be very much embarrassed.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.910
And while they were there so many Sikhs,

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:26.640
that time it was a big organisation – Sikhs and RSS were one,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.330
and they came to My house and said,

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.760
“We’ve heard there’s a Muslim staying with you.”

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.160
There was a Muslim.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.390
“And we’re going to kill that Muslim.”

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.170
I said, “What makes you think there’s a Muslim?”

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.770
“We’ve got reports.”

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.550
I said, “Wrong, there’s no Muslim in the house.”

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:53.400
I told him a lie.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.310
So they said, “How are we to believe you?”

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.900
I said, “See I’m wearing a thing (bindi).

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.760
I am a Hindu lady.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.650
How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:11.620
We’re all frightened of them and there’s no one like that.”

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.960
Somehow or other they believed Me.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.140
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:26.680
They had brought lots of those swords, with blood.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:36.590
But I was not afraid and I told them in a very determined manner.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.200
Anybody else in My place would have said,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:48.120
“Alright, alright there is one you can take away.”

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:54.400
Then these three persons, who were there, left My house

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.950
and one of them is a very famous actress,

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.120
another one is a very famous poet

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.870
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.220
And it so happened that

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:16.130
they (a charitable organisation) wanted to make a film about young people

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:22.200
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.370
and they wanted to call this actress.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.810
I said, “Don’t tell her My name.”

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.040
Because I had lost her completely.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.600
I’d just said let it be wherever they are, let them be.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.520
There’s no, sort of, I never made any enquiries or anything.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.750
“Don’t tell them My name.”

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.750
They said “Why?”

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:48.210
I said, “For some reason you just don’t tell her My name,

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.490
otherwise she’ll be compelled to say yes, which I don’t want.”

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.700
So when they went to her and asked her,

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.980
she said, “I must get a sari, I must get a chappal,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.410
I must get a purse to match, I must get this,

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.120
all this you have to pay, plus so much money you’ll have to pay.”

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.280
They said, “Ours is a charitable.”

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.810
She said, “Whatever it is.”

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:14.370
I said, “Alright, give her whatever she asks for.”

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:20.210
Then I went for the opening ceremony and she saw Me

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:25.420
and she couldn’t control herself, tears started rolling down her.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.490
Just came and fell at My feet.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:33.410
She said, “How are you here after such a long time?”

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.480
So they said, “She’s the one who’s making this film.”

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.480
“What?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:44.960
She’s making this film, why didn’t you tell me?

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960
My God, my God.”

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.990
She couldn’t help it, she was crying, crying, crying, crying.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.540
I said, “Now it’s alright.”

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.760
She said, “You take money from me.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.360
I’ll pay for the whole making of the film.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.100
You don’t know this lady.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.490
You don’t know her.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.910
What She’s done for me, nobody would do [what] she had done.”

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:09.330
She said, “She never told us anything how are we to know?”

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.980
Such a change that she, immediately she telephoned to her husband

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.980
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all…

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:24.720
But a small good gesture of administration:

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:31.170
that was My house given to Me by My father.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.940
That time of course My husband and My brother

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:42.820
didn’t know how to trust people.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.210
But I trusted them, fully.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.590
They were saying, “They will cut your throat.”

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.590
“Why?

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.900
Why will they cut My throat?

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.080
For what?”

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.680
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.880
And the worst thing I felt was

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:10.600
they were afraid because they had no money.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.730
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:22.160
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.120
Without money people started suffering very much.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.990
Poor people don’t mind because they are used to it.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.730
Whatever money they have, they eat it and sleep off.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:40.550
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.680
but they were poor people no doubt.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.720
But what I realised at that moment,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.880
that the people who have any position or any power or anything

00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:02.640
are literally frightened of everybody else.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.290
This is the beginning of our downfall.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:13.090
We got frightened.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.180
Those who were in charge got frightened

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:26.390
that I may lose my seat or I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:31.720
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.770
Supposing I am left with no money.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.500
So what?

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.230
What happens?

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:48.240
All these thoughts started coming after that partition, I felt it’s everywhere.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.460
While I’ll tell you in My childhood,

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.190
My father never used to lock the house, it was a very big house

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.430
he never use to lock.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.450
And we had a very beautiful gramophone

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.630
will all that horn sort of a thing.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:11.550
And one day one thief came and stole that.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:16.480
So next day we discovered, My father said,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.060
“Poor thing, he was fond of music so he’s taken away doesn’t matter,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.900
but he didn’t take the records now what will he use,

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.460
he must have records.”

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.111
So My Mother started teasing him,

00:26:29.111 --> 00:26:31.240
“Alright you advertise now.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.360
The one who has stolen our gramophone

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.350
should come and take the records they are available for him.”

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.590
It’s so natural you know.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.770
He just felt [that] we have money after all,

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.230
this fellow doesn’t have money

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:54.870
and he wants to listen to music you see.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.790
So My father said, ‘Alright’.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.270
Otherwise he was a criminal lawyer

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.460
My father knew law very well.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.240
Was not a stupid fool

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:11.190
but he couldn’t understand this fellow has only taken gramophone only

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.470
without the records.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.470
He said,

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.680
“he must not have found it, you see it was there kept and all that.”

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:24.340
My Mother said, “You better advertise it.”

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.290
He was a politician also.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:34.740
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.740
how to raise the standard of these people

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:47.659
who are not having what we are having.

00:27:47.659 --> 00:27:56.170
All the people who had money donated lavishly to so many things.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.080
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Lakshminarayan,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:08.630
he donated all his money, everything, to a big university.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.930
Most of the things that happened in those days

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.160
were done by charity people.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.500
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.220
crores and crores and crores.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.950
They never thought like that.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:30.960
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.850
and do something good for others.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:40.360
So when the Rajalakshmi, Lakshmi that is the one responsible

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.080
for looking after the benevolence of the people,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:51.310
when She acts people think that they have,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:54.800
not even think, they do it, automatically,

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.370
that they are there for benevolence.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.380
They don’t have to tell themselves,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:08.190
it’s just that they feel that it is their job,

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.990
this is what they have to do, is to look after the people

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:17.040
they are to be brought to better levels of life.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.610
This is what they think, they don’t think like a party politics,

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:33.690
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind!

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:37.540
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi,

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:47.520
which rules the political side we can say, the kingdoms and all that

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:54.980
– first thing is generosity, first thing is generosity.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:02.880
For example, Mahavira was meditating and while coming out His cloth

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.670
– He had one cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:15.090
And the upper cloth just got caught up in the bushes.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.480
So he cut it out and came out with half the cloth

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.270
– it was in His own palace.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:25.440
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.330
He said, “See I have no clothes, I’m just naked.”

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.960
He came before Him like a beggar.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.560
“You have this, why don’t you give Me this cloth?

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.650
You can go to your palace and wear your dress.”

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.870
He said, “Alright.”

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:48.580
He took it out and gave it to him.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.390
And then He got some leaves and all that, covered Himself,

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.380
went to His palace and got dressed.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:31:01.460
But now these Jains, you know, they make His statue so big,

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.330
insult Him completely

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:17.200
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:26.279
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:28.690
Goddess is Shri Shobha!

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:33.520
She’s the One who decorates you.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.920
She’s a mother.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.510
She decorates you with ornaments,

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.560
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She’s your mother.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.740
She does it!

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:52.010
Like, Raja Janaka, He was the king so

00:31:52.010 --> 00:32:00.149
He had to wear ornaments, He had to wear beautiful clothes,

00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:01.700
He had to do everything.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.700
And when Nachiketa went to Him

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.980
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to this king

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.350
who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that and

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.100
he also had a big function of dancing and this.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:19.930
He said, “He’s not a saint so why my guru touches His feet?

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:24.860
He’s a king.”

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:32.740
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.950
He said, “Why have you come here Nachiketa?”

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.600
He said, “I’m here to get my Self-realisation.”

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.960
He said, “You can take all My kingdom

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.550
but not easy to give you Self-realisation.”

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:53.560
He said, “Alright, whatever you say I’ll do.”

00:32:53.560 --> 00:33:01.700
So He put a big sword on his head and asked him to sleep.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:07.630
He couldn’t sleep at all.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.090
Then they were having a bath,

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.770
he said, “Come and have bath in the river.”

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:18.090
People came and told that there’s fire and everybody’s running away

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.180
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood,

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.880
He was just sitting quietly.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.580
Nachiketa got a little upset.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.890
Then they said, “The fire is coming here

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.659
and all these cloths are going to be burnt.”

00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:40.990
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still He was meditating.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:45.810
Then they came out and Nachiketa found

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.279
that nothing that was burnt was there.

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:53.210
It was just an illusion for people.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.240
He was amazed.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.779
Then he realised what was wrong with him,

00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:08.630
that he was doubting the Divine power Itself.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:13.890
The one who was Janaka, who was a king,

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:17.840
was not bothered about His own powers, these are what?

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.870
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:25.320
Because I’m married, I have to wear a mangalsutra.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.140
So this is for the parampara, for the tradition style,

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:46.100
but inside He was a saint, a very high…high level of saintliness.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:56.900
When this thing happens that you get some position,

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.600
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:09.230
If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.230
It is a myth.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.080
There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.660
It’s just a myth.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:24.330
But suddenly people jump up.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:30.719
It is ego that gets pampered.

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:40.230
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rajalakshmi.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.840
She is the giver of balance.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:58.600
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.260
Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant,

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:07.450
I have done it, it’s not easy.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.080
Without fear.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:23.200
And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.520
And Her blessings are tremendous.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:43.840
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.300
Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:57.820
You are a queen, so you can’t behave like street women.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:08.000
With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.480
That dignity is full of love, love for others.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.870
That personality emits nothing

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:26.930
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:35.280
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.290
She doesn’t expect anything.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:43.660
She is a queen, what can you give to the queen?

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:48.220
She’s the highest of all in every way,

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.890
what can you give it to Her?

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:54.150
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.370
of all these countries are beggars.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:02.510
All the time give me this, give me this,

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.910
like greedy people going around are beggars!

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:13.350
They are not the people who can rule.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:19.780
Hankering after things.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:26.400
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.469
that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

00:38:33.469 --> 00:38:39.390
cares for each and every person who comes along.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:49.090
This is a blessing of the Goddess.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:53.430
Then the second blessing of the Goddess

00:38:53.430 --> 00:39:00.090
is that you develop a kind of a temperament,

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:09.020
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.160
and understanding what other people are like.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.770
There’s a story of a king who was going on a horse

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:21.900
and he met a drunkard.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.250
So you can say

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.990
these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.490
So the drunkard stopped.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:36.380
He said, “I want to buy your horse.”

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.980
People said, “Do you know what he is?”

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.790
“Yeah I know he’s a king.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:41.790
Alright.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:42.790
So what?

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:43.790
I want to buy his horse.”

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:48.970
He said, “Alright not today, tomorrow we’ll sell the horse to you.”

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.030
So went away.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.800
Next day he was called.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.780
So he came with folded hands bent down.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.960
He said, “What, you were the one who was going to buy my horse,

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.660
what has happened to you?

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.110
I want to sell it to you.”

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:14.500
He said, “Sir, the one who wanted to buy is dead.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.230
I am an ordinary person.”

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:38.370
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.850
that anybody would have been angry, would have said

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:42.890
“Beat this man!

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.920
Throw him away!

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.670
He talks to me like this,

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:52.690
behaves like this.”

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:58.320
What the king said was remarkable.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:07.209
Because he knew he’s drunk, he knew he’s not in his senses,

00:41:07.209 --> 00:41:12.130
that’s why he’s talking.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.090
Didn’t get angry with him,

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:17.130
he said, “Alright, come along tomorrow, I’ll sell you the horse.”

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.160
That’s only possible if you have this Rajalakshmi in you

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.730
otherwise you would never behave like this.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:31.020
Now what about today’s politicians anywhere?

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.010
They even shoot people, they kill people,

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.300
they arrest them,they put them into trouble I mean,

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:50.930
all kinds of things they are doing.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:58.250
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals!

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.970
But we accept!

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.719
As in Hindi we say, “Aaj kal ka zamana hai aisa.”

00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:07.540
(Such is todays world)

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:16.430
We accept it – all such people as our rulers.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:23.780
Then Rajalakshmi is the one who stands on dharma.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.810
She stands on dharma.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:38.230
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:46.130
Adharmi is to be taken out.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:58.670
But if he’s not, then he will go all out to save that person.

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:06.240
But if he finds he’s adharmi, he will not.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:13.630
Is a kind of a divine discretion he should have

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:21.690
as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:27.840
That divine discretion should be there in a person,

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.130
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:42.020
who are around you, teaching you something, doing something.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:48.760
One day I was in My mother’s place Nandgaon,

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.720
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.340
I just kept quiet.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:04.090
He was a big politician and he told Me,

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:08.520
“We have to do like this and we have to do.”

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.380
I said, “Alright, alright, alright.”

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:16.490
Then three, four professors from the university came to tell Me,

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.280
“Mother, he’s a politician, be very careful.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.900
He’s a very bad man, you be careful about him.”

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.320
I said, “What do you know about him?”

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.190
They said, “He’s a politician.”

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.090
I said, “There are so many politicians.”

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:31.710
“But he’s not a good man.”

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.890
“But what do you mean?”

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.610
I said, “Now you sit down and I’ll tell you.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:40.480
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:48.699
He himself is not a Brahmin and this child is from him to her

00:44:48.699 --> 00:44:54.110
and how much he has deceived people everything I know.”

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.110
They were shocked.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.110
“You know Mother?”

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.450
“Of course.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:02.470
I know everything!”

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:12.780
“Then why do You allow him to come close to You?”

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.310
“Do you think he is close to Me?”

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:21.850
I said, “You are sadly mistaken.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:26.330
But it’s nice he’s come to Me

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:30.990
because he’s been troubling people too much and I’ll correct him.”

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:35.070
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got,

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.110
and some of them came to tell Me be careful of this man

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:45.250
without knowing what he was.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:50.230
This kind of a divine discretion has to be there.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.290
If a king does not have that divine discretion

00:45:54.290 --> 00:46:07.190
then he can punish the good and he may help the bad people.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:11.260
But this divine discretion disappears when you are self-centred.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.130
That’s the main point, is a complete detachment

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.719
about the power should be there.

00:46:18.719 --> 00:46:20.630
Complete detachment.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.880
Why should Rajalakshmi care for anything?

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:29.160
What does She get?

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.090
But now there are some who’ll pamper a person

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.570
this, this and that, and then they feel

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:39.810
“ah, we’re on top of the world!”

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.630
They just pamper, pamper and pamper

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:51.080
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man,

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:59.110
then in the election he doesn’t understand why he’s on the ground.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:09.850
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.110
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever you may say to Me,

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:16.060
I’ll listen, “Alright, alright, alright”,

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:23.010
but I don’t accept anything as something great.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:29.420
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:35.130
Now supposing this is a lamp here.

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.320
So is it great or not great?

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.430
It is a lamp.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:51.730
So if I’m Adi Shakti, I’m Adi Shakti, So what?

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:56.140
If you are a king you are a king so what?

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.880
I mean if you are an impostor then you might feel your ego.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:07.340
But if you are really the king then you won’t feel.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:14.260
If you are under the influence of the Goddess

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:19.570
then that is the only thing you enjoy.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:24.480
The rest of it is nothing.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.260
Whether you have diamonds or you have silver

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:40.850
or you have anything makes no difference at all.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:46.560
Now how people misuse the scriptures also one should see.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.990
That, Rajalakshmi is sitting on the elephant alright,

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:57.110
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:03.010
She’s sitting on the elephant because elephant is the highest animal!

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:10.430
Is very kind, very forgiving and has such a tremendous memory.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:17.500
That’s why She’s sitting on an elephant.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:24.410
She’s not sitting there to show off.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:30.890
But She’s sitting there to see around, what is happening

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:39.540
avalokan, She can see around what is happening, to be at a higher place.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:49.209
That’s why a king is made to sit on a higher pedestal.

00:49:49.209 --> 00:49:53.150
But the purpose is not to show off.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.209
But the purpose is

00:49:56.209 --> 00:50:02.689
that from that state he can see others better,

00:50:02.689 --> 00:50:12.709
he can be watchful of others.

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:15.020
If somebody gets a high position

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:25.350
then they think they are the owners of that position.

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:36.570
This has all come because the brain has gone upside down I think.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:40.680
How can it be?

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.600
Logically?

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:50.469
Now if you are this throne is given, alright, so with the throne

00:50:50.469 --> 00:50:58.820
I sit on this, but this throne cannot give Me anything,

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:04.650
I can give something to this throne.

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:08.930
The king has to think he is obliging all these things th

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:13.650
at he is sitting on them because he is a king.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:18.590
On the contrary he thinks all these things are important because something is lacking

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:22.920
in him or what?

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.890
And that’s why when they come to do Raj

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:31.990
they start gathering things which are useless absolutely,

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:39.480
clutter up their houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:47.730
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.709
and to show that they are kings.

00:51:49.709 --> 00:51:52.040
Of course they are given a crown,

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:58.380
they are given a big necklace, they are to wear something here

00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:59.380
because they are kings.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:09.130
But these are not actually his decorations

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:15.790
but these things get decorated by a king.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:21.510
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow from the street,

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:27.860
half starved, who is a beggar, say, for example,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:35.420
and put those ornaments on him and all the dresses of a king.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:41.060
Put him on the stage, everybody may start laughing.

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:47.370
Nobody will think that he is a king by any chance,

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:50.570
because he doesn’t have that dignity, doesn’t have that face,

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.990
he doesn’t have that body, he doesn’t have that mind,

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:55.980
he doesn’t have that wisdom.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:59.870
So how is he a king?

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:07.219
Like, there was one king who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

00:53:07.219 --> 00:53:09.790
But he’s so stupid looking, you know,

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:13.830
that when I saw the pearls I said,

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:19.110
“This is the man only who can think like this!”

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:22.230
So stupid he was to look at.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:29.740
And was sure of these pearls being put on his shoes.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:35.910
So there are many such things these days all of these stupid people are doing.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:39.500
There are big, big cartoons coming out

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:45.480
and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:51.740
To Me it’s such a difference I tell you.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:52.870
Such a difference.

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:56.700
To them all these things are so important,

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:04.080
which if they don’t have they’ll buy and put it.

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:13.290
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland to our program,

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:21.770
I mean to our dinner, I asked him, “Why are you carrying the garland?”

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:27.120
“See after all you see I was garlanded so I’m keeping the garland.”

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:31.200
We didn’t know what to do!

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.820
We Indians will never take a garland,

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.760
first of all, anybody gives you they’ll put it, except for the Gods.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.340
They will take it out immediately.

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.950
Another lady who came to see Me and she said,

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:44.750
“I don’t understand these Indians,

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.590
I bought a garland, I put it in my neck

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:52.940
so they were all laughing on the street at me.”

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:59.670
Now you Indians understand this, how subtle it is, just see,

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:03.220
that you can’t put garland, you are not God.

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:08.000
You cannot buy a garland (laughing) and put it in your neck and walk out.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.330
Innately you have to be that.

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:24.939
So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rajalakshmi.

00:55:24.939 --> 00:55:27.840
Then what does She do?

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.780
What does She do to such a man?

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:35.380
What She does is first

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:43.230
his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:51.750
She writes it with her own hand.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.330
They adore him,

00:55:54.330 --> 00:56:05.700
they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:13.070
Another blessing of Rajalakshmi is

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:23.000
that She grants a particular type of a body,

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:31.189
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

00:56:31.189 --> 00:56:39.180
They may not be very selfish people

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.760
to make a big advertisement about themselves,

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.030
talking about themselves, this that.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:54.760
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:02.969
We had many like these in our times also.

00:57:02.969 --> 00:57:08.449
Maybe that people didn’t accept them, maybe they are nowhere now,

00:57:08.449 --> 00:57:14.060
some new johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:19.330
But whatever name is written in the heart of the people,

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:24.439
are the people who are blessed by this Rajalakshmi.

00:57:24.439 --> 00:57:27.830
So what a politician has to understand [is]

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:33.420
that he has not to make money,

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:43.010
he does not have to have a big show about himself.

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:49.780
He does not have to do anything that is like

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.110
laundering the money from the country.

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:57.141
He does not have to kill others who oppose him,

00:57:57.141 --> 00:58:01.360
he doesn’t have to shout at those who trouble them.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.290
But what has he to do?

00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:05.710
He has to remember that.

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:14.350
“I am here for the fame of a good man.”

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:21.900
He should worry about the fame he will be leaving after his death.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:25.780
He should see to it that his fame is safe.

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:38.209
For example, see Shri Rama who was a king of benevolence, no doubt about it.

00:58:38.209 --> 00:58:44.320
But His own wife when somebody challenged that

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.060
– “She has lived with Ravana and how can She be pure?”

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:55.270
He knew that She was pure, still He decided that He will ask Her to go

00:58:55.270 --> 00:59:05.280
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image of a king

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:10.670
and He sent Her away.

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:16.610
But nowadays you find somebody’s brother employed in America,

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:22.490
sister employed there and he has made, his uncle has made a big house

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:25.340
and his wife has accumulated so much money.

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:31.340
It is all going on.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.410
Everybody will talk like that about that person,

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:37.010
that he’s just money oriented,

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:42.040
he just spends money on nonsensical things and he is just exploiting us.

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:49.460
Everybody will talk but nobody will tell him on the face.

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:54.689
So what you have to worry is about absolute correct character.

00:59:54.689 --> 01:00:00.660
These days this is another point.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.660
Every politician

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.451
must have three, four keeps otherwise he is not a politician.

01:00:03.451 --> 01:00:08.910
Like we had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow

01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:10.140
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.760
He thought if he doesn’t have hundred and sixty five,

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:20.420
people won’t accept him as a Nawab.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.490
So this is another inferiority complex

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:27.380
that you should have some women around you

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:36.010
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:44.380
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:53.660
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody who is not blessed by Rajalakshmi

01:00:53.660 --> 01:01:03.130
will have to go to jail or will have to leave the seat,

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:08.570
will be thrown away or will be as they say,

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.110
“Doubly dying go to the waste, dust”.

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:14.100
It has to be.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:20.860
They’ll be all exposed, whatever tricks they may try.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:33.650
And they will have the consequence of being artificially the rulers.

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:46.020
But a genuineness is the sign that the queen of blessings,

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:54.350
the goddess of Rajalakshmi, is residing in that person.

01:01:54.350 --> 01:02:04.420
In Satya Yuga it will happen I’m sure.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.950
But even in Sahaja Yoga I find people doing politics sometimes,

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.850
I was amazed!

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:17.380
People think politics means keeping groups,

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:23.280
making groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.810
That shows you lack collectivity.

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:36.810
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:43.380
because the power lies in collectivity.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.669
To break the collectivity for anything

01:02:48.669 --> 01:02:57.640
is very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:03.050
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:09.240
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:17.199
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well,

01:03:17.199 --> 01:03:22.270
sit properly, should take up your seats.

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:25.120
You have to be systematic

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.880
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.680
You are not ordinary people.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.700
You are special people.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:42.560
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.949
You are special people,

01:03:45.949 --> 01:03:56.780
so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Rajalakshmi

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.650
that people when they will see you they will vote for you

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:14.890
and tomorrow you will rule the world.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:20.010
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:25.870
but you have to first get the blessings of the Rajalakshmi

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:28.390
and then only you should understand

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:32.620
what’s wrong with our country, what we have to do,

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:40.100
what is the purpose, why do we want to become politicians,

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:45.800
what we have to do, we have to have plans, what is your project.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.940
All these things now put your attention from yourself to outside.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:55.720
Like, that day I received a letter saying,

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:00.010
“my father is sick and my mother is sick then my son is sick,

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:02.920
and this and that and that and that.”

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.110
Such people can’t do much.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.050
When the war of independence started in India

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:13.199
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents, gave up everything,

01:05:13.199 --> 01:05:16.060
we were very young people.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.210
So now you have to know

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:23.510
that if you have to really take to politics

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:25.870
you have to have the blessings of Rajalakshmi

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:30.340
and for that you have to build up yourself

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:34.459
with that dignity, with that sense.

01:05:34.459 --> 01:07:40.850
I bless you from My heart that in every country such

01:07:40.850 --> 01:08:44.029
people

01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:49.379
will come up.

01:08:49.379 --> 01:10:43.819
May God bless you.
