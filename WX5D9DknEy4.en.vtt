04:19.542 --> 04:22.709
I must have said lots of things about Christ before,

04:22.751 --> 04:28.042
and how Jesus Christ is related to Shri Radhaji,

04:28.084 --> 04:37.709
that He is the incarnation of Sri Ganesha who was the son of the Adi Shakti

04:37.709 --> 04:41.668
to begin with but then he was given to Shri Radhaji

04:41.668 --> 04:48.209
and Shri Radha created as Mahalaxmi, as Mother Mary

04:48.209 --> 04:51.459
this great incarnation of Christ.

04:51.459 --> 04:56.751
Now for the western mind it is impossible to understand

04:56.793 --> 05:01.376
how there can be a immaculate conception because they have no sense at all,

05:01.417 --> 05:05.042
no sensitivity at all to spiritual life.

05:05.042 --> 05:06.834
We Indians can understand it,

05:06.876 --> 05:09.918
is very easy for Indians to understand

05:09.918 --> 05:13.834
because we had Sri Ganesha created that way.

05:13.876 --> 05:16.292
We just believe it we don't doubt these things.

05:16.334 --> 05:18.626
Whatever is said about God is not to be doubted

05:18.668 --> 05:21.958
with this limited brain, that's not done in India.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.918
But in the west, from the very birth of Christ

05:26.918 --> 05:31.542
they have had arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments

05:31.542 --> 05:37.209
with this limited brain they had, and the whole religion in the name of Christ

05:37.209 --> 05:43.209
is just a perversion, such a horrible things have been said

05:43.250 --> 05:52.167
that it's unbelievable. His purity, his holiness, his auspiciousness

05:52.209 --> 05:55.376
is never understood in the west I think.

05:55.417 --> 06:02.376
Those who follow Christianity, how can they be so debased

06:02.376 --> 06:07.042
in their moral character. They're all right for their political,

06:07.084 --> 06:13.626
their economical you can say, their legal side but their moral sense

06:13.668 --> 06:16.459
is absolutely missing. Is very surprising,

06:16.501 --> 06:18.334
those who are the followers of Christ

06:18.376 --> 06:23.167
should have the greatest amount of morality.

06:23.167 --> 06:31.125
He has said that thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,

06:31.167 --> 06:36.376
such a subtle thing, even the eye should not have adultery,

06:36.417 --> 06:44.501
should not have lust and greed. Such a subtle thing he has said it,

06:44.501 --> 06:50.292
and just think in the west people could not follow it

06:50.334 --> 06:52.958
because the whole religion got perverted

06:52.958 --> 07:00.751
under the influence of Paul and Peter. It's a very serious thing

07:00.793 --> 07:03.918
they have done against Christ, it's still going on.

07:03.918 --> 07:08.084
Still this Catholic church, though being exposed so much,

07:08.125 --> 07:10.751
is still going on, in India also all over,

07:10.793 --> 07:15.042
is stupid this Protestant church also is going on everywhere.

07:15.042 --> 07:19.751
What good name have they brought to Christ? One should see.

07:19.793 --> 07:24.084
The first and foremost thing he has said

07:24.084 --> 07:31.376
that you must enter into the Kingdom of God,

07:31.417 --> 07:33.626
that you must be born again.

07:33.626 --> 07:37.292
So it's all mental, you are born again,

07:37.292 --> 07:40.793
you have a certificate, you are born again, finished.

07:40.834 --> 07:46.958
So this mental attitude of the west is responsible

07:47.000 --> 07:55.417
for killing the great incarnation of Christ,

07:55.417 --> 07:57.834
I think is another crucifixion.

07:57.876 --> 08:02.542
Mentally you cannot understand spirituality.

08:02.542 --> 08:05.918
So they were telling your brain trust, brain trust,

08:05.958 --> 08:09.751
I said brain trusting-I can't understand in Sahaja Yoga.

08:09.751 --> 08:20.584
In Sahaja Yoga what is the brain trust? Where is the brain?

08:20.584 --> 08:27.417
In thoughtless awareness where is the brain?

08:27.459 --> 08:32.209
So this brain trust business might be all right

08:32.209 --> 08:35.250
for any other place but for Sahaja Yoga, I still don't understand

08:35.250 --> 08:38.709
what do you do in brain trust. Because some people

08:39.793 --> 08:41.042
want to come on the stage and speak you see,

08:41.042 --> 08:50.334
they have a kind of a madness, they can't get over it.

08:50.376 --> 08:53.292
So they might be coming to the brain trust maybe,

08:53.292 --> 09:02.542
but it's not brain, it's the heart, is the heart

09:02.584 --> 09:08.876
which has to be opened out because with the brain

09:08.918 --> 09:13.084
what we do is all kinds of materialism.

09:13.084 --> 09:18.876
All kinds of nonsense has come from human brain only,

09:18.918 --> 09:23.668
not so much from animals brain. You can see

09:23.709 --> 09:29.501
if you go to any forest it's clean, nice smelling,

09:29.542 --> 09:33.125
so well but put one human being there and you will know

09:33.167 --> 09:38.250
that this filth, dirt has come from some human being.

09:38.292 --> 09:47.084
So as it is they have made a mess of all the great incarnations

09:47.125 --> 09:53.376
but worst is done to Christ and I feel what a waste it was.

09:53.417 --> 10:03.626
So we must understand Christ in the right sense, he is the eternal child,

10:03.668 --> 10:09.209
he is the innocence itself, he's the source of innocence

10:09.250 --> 10:14.292
and he is the bestower of all blessings in all chakras.

10:15.668 --> 10:18.751
But that doesn't mean that you are Christians,

10:18.793 --> 10:23.334
you should be very proud that oh she's talking about Christ,

10:23.334 --> 10:27.709
many I've seen Sahaja Yogis are still identified with Christ

10:27.709 --> 10:30.958
while they have nothing to do with Christ at all.

10:30.958 --> 10:43.417
Now one has to understand that how Christ in his miraculous life

10:43.417 --> 10:47.876
has shown so many miracles. First of all his birth was immaculate.

10:50.167 --> 10:52.542
So now they are discussing the birth of Mary

10:52.584 --> 10:55.793
whether it's immaculate or not. For all incarnations

10:55.834 --> 10:59.709
every kind of birth is immaculate, they are beyond sins,

10:59.709 --> 11:02.250
they are special people. They may come as human beings,

11:02.250 --> 11:05.042
they may come as angels, they may come as anything,

11:05.084 --> 11:08.918
they are divine and we should understand

11:08.958 --> 11:12.793
that this little brain of ours cannot discuss about them

11:12.793 --> 11:19.292
and talk about them but is to just surrender and worship them.

11:19.334 --> 11:26.668
They are much beyond us. So for the western mind

11:26.668 --> 11:31.334
it is important to understand that the life of Christ

11:31.376 --> 11:36.250
was such a blessing for them that they have lost it,

11:36.250 --> 11:40.250
they have wasted it and they have never understood how to respect it.

11:40.292 --> 11:50.793
The whole thing became like a political, economical, nonsensical fraud.

11:50.834 --> 12:00.918
I have told you long time back that how we can prove

12:00.918 --> 12:05.459
that Christ was Ganesha and he was the logos,

12:05.501 --> 12:10.209
he was the what we call is the Brahmanat, the first sound.

12:10.250 --> 12:17.668
By looking at your left side from the right side,

12:17.668 --> 12:23.209
if you see the Mooladhara you will see swastikas

12:23.209 --> 12:26.209
because it is made of carbon atom.

12:26.250 --> 12:31.501
If you see from left to the right you can see Omkara

12:31.501 --> 12:38.584
and if you see from down upward it looks like Alpha and Omega.

12:38.626 --> 12:44.167
In those days Christ has said I am the Alpha and I am the Omega

12:44.209 --> 12:46.292
and now we have made the animation,

12:46.292 --> 12:48.167
we have no arrangement to show you there,

12:48.209 --> 12:50.376
I don't know if you could arrange it somehow,

12:50.376 --> 12:54.958
but you can see it clearly, what I have said can be proved.

12:54.959 --> 13:01.209
So as you worship Ganesha you must worship Christ

13:01.209 --> 13:05.250
in the same manner for all those who worship Ganesha.

13:05.292 --> 13:09.292
Because I have seen that Hindus, they are stuck to Ganesha

13:09.334 --> 13:18.542
and Christians are stuck to Christ, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

13:18.584 --> 13:23.167
they carry those traits. Ganesha is all right up to a point

13:23.209 --> 13:31.709
and then it is important we must pray to his incarnation that is Christ.

13:31.751 --> 13:38.417
In the same way those who worship Christ must also worship Ganesha

13:38.417 --> 13:44.709
because he is the source, he is the potential of Christ.

13:44.709 --> 13:50.834
All this was in the Divine plan, done with Divine discretion,

13:50.876 --> 13:54.584
everything was done so beautifully but as I told you

13:54.626 --> 13:58.626
human beings are good at massacring anything that is beautiful

13:58.626 --> 14:02.751
and that's how it has happened. It's very, very sad

14:02.793 --> 14:06.042
and on his birthday today we have to decide

14:06.084 --> 14:10.918
that he has to be born within us again, in a proper way,

14:10.918 --> 14:14.793
that he is the Alpha and the Omega.

14:14.793 --> 14:19.167
At that time of his time I didn't know that anybody knew

14:19.167 --> 14:23.668
about these symbols. These symbols also must have come

14:23.668 --> 14:28.501
from unconscious to some of the great mathematicians

14:28.501 --> 14:31.876
in long time and that's why these symbols

14:31.918 --> 14:35.958
are used exactly like Alpha and Omega,

14:36.000 --> 14:42.958
you see him clearly. It is so clear cut now in Sahaja Yoga,

14:42.958 --> 14:47.334
we can prove so many things all tangible;

14:47.376 --> 14:50.918
how Christ used to cure people, what did he do,

14:50.958 --> 14:56.542
it's all tangible, we can prove it now in Sahaja Yoga, how it works out,

14:56.584 --> 15:01.668
how these powers work out, but we have to first of all

15:01.709 --> 15:07.084
cleanse our lives, we have to lead a very honest,

15:07.084 --> 15:13.959
powerful and pure life. I've seen those stalls outside,

15:14.000 --> 15:18.542
I told them not to put up any stalls here

15:18.542 --> 15:22.459
because they are making profit for themselves not for Sahaja Yoga.

15:22.501 --> 15:27.958
Once Christ saw like that and he took a hunter and hit all of them,

15:27.958 --> 15:32.542
now I can't do that. One should not encourage these people,

15:32.542 --> 15:38.292
it's not a shopping centre, you have come for meditation.

15:38.334 --> 15:43.209
Is all right if you need anything we have bought things for you,

15:43.250 --> 15:46.417
if you buy them, there might be little profit, may not be,

15:46.417 --> 15:50.459
but that will go to Sahaja Yoga, is not going to be used

15:50.459 --> 15:55.042
for any private purpose. But these people from outside come

15:55.042 --> 15:58.376
and put up a stall and you all run about means

15:58.417 --> 16:00.292
you are still hanging around with that thing,

16:00.334 --> 16:03.459
you have come here for what?

16:03.501 --> 16:11.626
One should be all the time meditative in Ganapatipule,

16:11.668 --> 16:15.958
all the time you should be in a meditative condition

16:15.958 --> 16:19.417
and shouldn't get to these mundane things

16:19.459 --> 16:25.084
which you always do outside also. But these people know

16:25.125 --> 16:28.876
that you still have those weaknesses, that's why they have put up the stalls.

16:28.918 --> 16:38.376
Leaders should stop all this nonsense, I've told not to eat outside.

16:38.376 --> 16:41.459
Last time all of you suffered because of that

16:41.459 --> 16:44.584
but still the stalls are on, that means see they know

16:44.626 --> 16:48.958
there are some culprits who would like to buy things from them

16:48.959 --> 16:52.250
and get sick and bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

16:52.292 --> 16:56.959
So the first thing of Ganesha is that wisdom,

16:57.000 --> 17:04.793
and that wisdom we see in the life of Christ,

17:04.834 --> 17:09.501
from the very beginning, he was so confident of it

17:09.559 --> 17:16.893
that at the age of twelve years he went and talked to these parses,

17:16.918 --> 17:20.626
means the people who were priests, we still have priests

17:20.626 --> 17:23.876
and mullahs and these burgees and all of them,

17:23.918 --> 17:28.334
these so called dharmamantandas, all over,

17:28.334 --> 17:33.542
but he went and argued with them at that young age

17:33.584 --> 17:36.584
and he was just saying what are you doing here.

17:36.626 --> 17:45.918
What is this? What are you talking, all lip service.

17:45.918 --> 17:49.793
He was discussing and talking to them

17:49.834 --> 17:54.958
but his parents were perhaps, were frightened that these people

17:54.958 --> 17:57.417
might kill him so they brought him to India,

17:57.417 --> 17:59.542
he came to India for wisdom.

17:59.584 --> 18:03.167
I don't know where is that wisdom missing now from Indians,

18:03.209 --> 18:07.167
but must be this country was full of wisdom when he came

18:07.209 --> 18:14.958
and stayed in India and we have lots of memories

18:14.959 --> 18:20.626
about him, even the King Shaliman met him, is described in his book

18:20.668 --> 18:25.292
that he met a man in Cashmere who was very saintly

18:25.292 --> 18:27.959
and he asked him what's your name?

18:28.000 --> 18:34.958
He said my name is Isa, see now imagine-Isa.

18:34.958 --> 18:39.626
I is the word used in the Vedas for the Adi Shakti-

18:39.668 --> 18:47.668
Sa means with.He said my name is Isa, he said from what country do you come.

18:47.709 --> 18:52.084
He said I come from a country which is foreign to me

18:52.125 --> 18:57.876
and this is my country. So this India, the Bharat,

18:57.876 --> 19:05.751
the Hindustan was the country of spirituality, and one should not try to compete

19:05.793 --> 19:11.334
and feel inferior to other countries who have gone up materially higher,

19:11.376 --> 19:13.042
you don't know where they are,

19:13.084 --> 19:18.584
but we should be spiritually higher,

19:18.584 --> 19:25.250
that's what Christ said. This is my own country, is clearly written,

19:25.292 --> 19:27.084
that means Christ recognised

19:27.125 --> 19:31.417
that this country of spirituality is his own.

19:31.417 --> 19:37.042
So we belong to that country of spirituality

19:37.084 --> 19:43.834
and not to the materialistic or to the mundane or the baser type of life.

19:43.834 --> 19:58.000
In his life time which was so very short, whatever he has said,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.417
every word is great but as I told you

20:02.417 --> 20:10.167
that this Paul tried to completely change, re-edit the bible

20:10.167 --> 20:15.250
and he's put lots of things in there, whatever weaknesses he has,

20:15.292 --> 20:19.542
he has put them nicely.  Now recently I've got a book

20:19.584 --> 20:25.459
which was hidden in a jar in Egypt

20:25.501 --> 20:31.793
for about, till fifty years they discovered it, and this book is called

20:31.793 --> 20:35.250
as the Library of Hamadhi. The place was called Hamadhi

20:35.250 --> 20:38.834
were it was discovered, and what Christ has said,

20:38.876 --> 20:44.626
what Thomas has written, when Thomas was coming to India he put all these things there, is very interesting.

20:44.668 --> 20:49.958
About drinking, he said drinking begets debauchery,

20:49.958 --> 20:53.958
it's a bad word to use and while Christians don't know.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.584
On the contrary they think that drinking is allowed in Christianity,

21:00.626 --> 21:04.000
very nicely. Was he mad to allow drinking?

21:04.000 --> 21:10.376
How can he allow drinking

21:10.376 --> 21:12.958
which goes against your awareness,

21:12.958 --> 21:15.250
but they thought it was nice,

21:15.250 --> 21:22.042
and that's what people have been using as a big attraction

21:22.084 --> 21:24.584
that you can drink in Christianity.

21:24.626 --> 21:32.958
So in the other religion, like Catholic religion, you could have only once the Marriage.

21:32.958 --> 21:39.042
So they have one marriage and ten keeps, is all right,

21:39.042 --> 21:41.334
allowed, in the bible is written,

21:41.376 --> 21:44.417
only you can have one marriage you cannot divorce,

21:44.459 --> 21:47.918
do what you like. No sense of morality

21:47.958 --> 21:54.876
and everything came like a derailment towards themselves

21:54.918 --> 21:58.876
and they accepted one after another, all kinds of nonsense,

21:58.876 --> 22:04.876
and the basic thing of Christ's life is morality.

22:04.918 --> 22:10.125
He is on the left side as you can see he's from Sri Ganesh

22:10.167 --> 22:13.292
and then he establishes himself at Agnya,

22:13.292 --> 22:18.668
but morality is the essence of his life,

22:18.709 --> 22:24.709
what we call in India language his character.

22:24.751 --> 22:33.459
Our character is how we lead a life of purity.

22:33.501 --> 22:38.376
We indulge into all kinds of nonsense,

22:38.417 --> 22:42.417
I mean if you go to the west you'll be amazed what things they do.

22:42.417 --> 22:48.000
I mean you cannot even believe it

22:48.042 --> 22:51.584
and I cannot even mention it to you, you won't believe

22:51.584 --> 22:54.042
that these so called advanced countries

22:54.084 --> 22:56.084
are advancing towards what.

22:56.125 --> 23:04.209
Impossible we cannot conceive it even, such an impurity,

23:04.209 --> 23:15.334
such a horrible, destructive immorality,

23:15.376 --> 23:17.668
and I don't know from where it comes,

23:17.668 --> 23:19.834
I think it's something wrong with the genetics,

23:19.876 --> 23:24.209
from where do they get these ideas. One after another

23:24.250 --> 23:31.167
it's impossible to believe these people doing all these things

23:31.209 --> 23:34.834
and then nicely dress up and go to church on Sunday,

23:34.876 --> 23:41.668
pray to God and come back. Now it is for you to decide,

23:41.709 --> 23:45.459
you have to pull out all these people in your own countries

23:45.501 --> 23:51.542
and you have to tell them this is all nonsense in the name of Christ,

23:51.542 --> 23:59.042
in the name of God, you have to come up and talk about it,

23:59.042 --> 24:03.668
same about Sri Ganesh. I have seen in Poona, I was surprised,

24:03.709 --> 24:08.793
there was Ganesh ........... everybody was drinking nicely,

24:08.834 --> 24:13.334
the horrible dirty songs, some western songs,

24:13.376 --> 24:16.958
some horrible cinema songs put up there

24:16.958 --> 24:22.167
and everybody was using as a disco in front of Sri Ganesh.

24:22.209 --> 24:27.209
Sahaja Yogis should go and object to this kind of a nonsense

24:27.250 --> 24:30.918
they are in that how could they drink in the presence of Sri Ganesh.

24:30.918 --> 24:42.084
No wisdom of Sri Ganesha, no respect for his auspiciousness.

24:42.084 --> 24:46.376
Now not only drinking, doing all kinds of things.

24:46.417 --> 24:50.793
Sri Ganesha has been shown by these tantrikas

24:50.834 --> 24:55.000
as something so horrible which is also done

24:55.042 --> 24:59.793
by so many psychologists, so called, in the west.

24:59.834 --> 25:04.209
Thank God one of them is Mr. Freud is exposed now.

25:04.250 --> 25:11.250
So the another quality of Ganesha, is shown in Christ's life,

25:11.292 --> 25:18.918
is a devotion to Mother. In that book the,

25:18.918 --> 25:25.751
Mary is telling them about knowledge,

25:25.751 --> 25:30.834
but this Paul objects to it,

25:30.834 --> 25:37.125
and she says that this is what you have to achieve.

25:37.167 --> 25:40.668
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with her,

25:40.709 --> 25:49.584
but then Thomas said that what Christ has said on the Cross

25:49.626 --> 25:56.542
"behold the Mother". She is the Mother of Christ

25:56.542 --> 26:02.417
and how dare he insult her but just the opposite,

26:02.459 --> 26:09.668
Paul never respected women, so he appointed,

26:09.668 --> 26:14.876
I mean he called her as just a woman.

26:14.876 --> 26:19.376
No respect for Mahalaxmi, no respect.

26:19.376 --> 26:25.793
Can you imagine, just a woman,

26:25.834 --> 26:28.000
and a big controversy going on

26:28.042 --> 26:32.584
on these so called advanced people whether the women

26:32.626 --> 26:35.793
should be ordained as priests or not.

26:35.793 --> 26:38.125
We think we are very backward

26:38.167 --> 26:42.501
but I think they are so backward in religion, nonsense.

26:42.542 --> 26:45.668
We had.............

26:45.668 --> 26:48.876
such people here and we respect the Mother

26:48.918 --> 26:56.292
as the Adi Shakti, she is the one we call her, the one who has created us,

26:56.334 --> 26:58.250
she is the one who looks after us,

26:58.292 --> 27:01.709
for us she is important, Shakti is important,

27:01.709 --> 27:07.542
they don't call her Shakti but a woman,

27:07.584 --> 27:13.042
and supposed to be very advanced people,

27:13.084 --> 27:19.334
and all other nonsense they do in the name of advancement.

27:19.334 --> 27:28.209
It's impossible to tell, my words fall short, feel so ashamed

27:28.209 --> 27:32.042
in the name of Christ.

27:32.084 --> 27:39.084
Today now when we are celebrating the pure life of Christ,

27:39.125 --> 27:43.376
he came on this earth. They can't believe

27:43.417 --> 27:48.000
that he could have been so pure. A criminal cannot believe

27:48.042 --> 27:50.834
that others could be non criminal.

27:50.876 --> 28:00.250
So we have to within ourselves see if we have developed

28:00.250 --> 28:06.668
that purity of mind that expresses through our eyes.

28:06.668 --> 28:12.334
Eyes have to become innocent, otherwise they have no effect.

28:12.376 --> 28:19.584
If you are hankering after attracting other people

28:19.626 --> 28:22.334
and charming other people and all that,

28:22.334 --> 28:25.709
you are not a Sahaja Yogi, there's no need.

28:25.709 --> 28:29.125
Once the light is within yourself, people will know.

28:29.167 --> 28:35.292
As Sahaja Yogis you have to have

28:35.334 --> 28:40.000
the light of Christ in your own life.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.626
He was a young man who came on this earth, and how he lived.

28:46.668 --> 28:53.000
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalen, who was a prostitute,

28:53.000 --> 28:58.334
but he stood by truth, and when people started stoning her

28:58.334 --> 29:03.000
he stood up and said those who are not committed any sin

29:03.042 --> 29:09.459
can throw the stone at me. What a strength of truth.

29:09.459 --> 29:17.042
So not that only he was a pure personality but purity also

29:17.626 --> 29:21.834
is expressed in truth and his compassion and love.

29:21.876 --> 29:27.501
Such compassion he has expressed, such compassion.

29:27.542 --> 29:31.876
I think Sri Ganesha got a little transformation.

29:31.876 --> 29:36.958
Sri Ganesha is definitely very compassionate to people

29:36.958 --> 29:43.751
who are worshipping him but those who go against them

29:43.793 --> 29:49.626
he hits them hard.............they have to suffer,

29:49.668 --> 29:53.834
aids, this, that, everything comes.

29:53.834 --> 30:01.292
But those who are pure people, Sri Ganesha protects.

30:01.292 --> 30:04.292
But Christ is compassionate, he forgives

30:04.292 --> 30:08.459
because he believes that there could be a transformation.

30:08.459 --> 30:15.417
At the level of Sri Ganesha he thinks is better

30:15.417 --> 30:19.209
that let them be killed and be born again

30:19.209 --> 30:23.459
because they're so impure but Christ had hopes

30:23.501 --> 30:25.626
that he can transform people,

30:25.626 --> 30:30.376
but he could not, they crucified him.

30:30.417 --> 30:35.793
What wonderful people they must have been to crucify Christ.

30:35.793 --> 30:41.209
Brainless we should call them, absolutely

30:41.250 --> 30:46.167
without any understanding about spirituality,

30:46.209 --> 30:51.958
very insensitive to true knowledge.

30:51.958 --> 31:00.417
So for Sahaja Yoga, only the wise can follow.

31:00.459 --> 31:07.167
It is not meant for stupid idiotic people nor it is meant for very smart ones.

31:07.209 --> 31:13.542
Some people think they are very smart because they are successful in life,

31:13.584 --> 31:17.751
they can say some smart sentences, they can say something very,

31:17.793 --> 31:23.668
outstandingly very sharp, it's not meant for that.

31:23.709 --> 31:30.042
For that Christ has said meek in heart will inherit the earth.

31:30.042 --> 31:36.876
Meek in heart, not those who think too much of themselves

31:36.876 --> 31:42.793
but for meek in heart will inherit the earth.

31:42.793 --> 31:45.751
Among Sahaja Yogis also only those who are meek in heart

31:45.793 --> 31:52.668
will inherit the blessing of Mother. You have to be meek,

31:52.709 --> 31:58.417
you have to be wise and with wisdom you'll become meek

31:58.417 --> 32:00.125
because then you will see

32:00.125 --> 32:03.459
where are we into this great cosmos,

32:03.459 --> 32:10.334
that, you will feel that you have entered into this Kingdom of God,

32:10.376 --> 32:15.958
for what? How? How have we come here?

32:15.959 --> 32:20.709
How have you entered here? So many tried,

32:20.709 --> 32:25.459
thousands of years sacrificing this sacrificing that,

32:25.501 --> 32:28.626
standing on their heads, fasting,

32:28.626 --> 32:31.626
how is it suddenly we got this blessing?

32:31.626 --> 32:33.876
How are we there?

32:33.918 --> 32:39.417
When we start looking at this we become meek.

32:39.417 --> 32:42.918
Is the blessing, is the grace.

32:42.918 --> 32:45.417
It's not through our ego,

32:45.459 --> 32:48.793
through our conditionings but is just the grace,

32:48.834 --> 32:53.125
the compassion, the love the Sandrakaruna,

32:53.125 --> 33:01.250
and then you enjoy your transformed life,

33:01.292 --> 33:09.417
the new dimension of spirituality which is in reality.

33:09.417 --> 33:12.958
Now you know reality, you know totality, you know everything

33:12.959 --> 33:16.459
but those who have not known themselves

33:16.501 --> 33:19.000
have not become Sahaja Yogis.

33:19.042 --> 33:25.793
Tukarama has said in very simple words .............

33:25.834 --> 33:31.709
the one who has known himself is the last one.

33:31.709 --> 33:36.042
You can judge the chakras of others

33:36.084 --> 33:38.167
but you can't judge your own chakras,

33:38.209 --> 33:40.501
you can introspect others,

33:40.501 --> 33:42.584
you can judge others but you cannot judge yourself.

33:42.584 --> 33:45.584
You know everything about others but about yourself

33:45.584 --> 33:50.918
you don't know anything, then you are not Sahaja Yogis.

33:50.918 --> 33:52.751
First thing you must know yourself.

33:52.751 --> 33:55.834
What sort of an ego stuff I am doing.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.250
What sort of a conditioning I have got.

33:58.250 --> 34:01.918
Even now people have so many conditionings.

34:01.958 --> 34:05.250
So there's a new discipline of Sahaja Yoga,

34:05.292 --> 34:13.876
in the new discipline you have to be meek, humble and you have to be wise.

34:13.918 --> 34:18.000
Every step of yours, every talk of yours,

34:18.042 --> 34:22.376
everything should express wisdom

34:22.417 --> 34:26.292
and the Sahaj discipline which automatically stops you

34:26.334 --> 34:28.000
from doing wrong things.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.709
Now say I'm walking down and some lady suddenly

34:30.751 --> 34:35.000
falls at my feet without even understanding that I am just walking,

34:35.000 --> 34:39.584
I may fall down or catches hold of my feet,

34:39.626 --> 34:43.709
is all self oriented.

34:43.751 --> 34:48.167
I should see Mother, I should go and meet her,

34:48.167 --> 34:51.834
I touched her feet, is all ego.

34:51.876 --> 34:57.042
A Sahaja Yogi stands in the back,

34:57.084 --> 35:05.834
real Sahaja Yogi is at the back from there he can enjoy because he knows I am everywhere.

35:05.876 --> 35:14.084
He doesn't want to see me, nothing, just like this, standing.

35:14.125 --> 35:18.834
He doesn't force his way in any way.

35:18.876 --> 35:23.000
Mother is here.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.125
But this is what it is Christ has said, meek in heart.

35:29.167 --> 35:33.084
There's a very big word "meek" and people don't understand meek

35:33.084 --> 35:36.292
because in the west if you are meek people say you are weak,

35:36.292 --> 35:38.918
you have to be aggressive. If they have to praise somebody

35:38.958 --> 35:41.584
they'll say, oh he is very good, he is very aggressive.

35:41.626 --> 35:45.876
I think their genetics are little lower than normal,

35:45.876 --> 35:51.417
must be some animals in them otherwise how can they think

35:51.417 --> 35:56.209
that to be aggressive is being something higher.

35:56.250 --> 36:04.501
It's impossible, how can a person who is supposed

36:04.542 --> 36:07.959
to be a higher person, could be like a devil.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.084
How could Hitler say that he was a higher race

36:13.125 --> 36:16.417
when he was himself a devil?

36:16.459 --> 36:20.793
Is very nice for a devil to say I am a higher race.

36:20.793 --> 36:29.376
So in dealing in Sahaja Yoga, the sweetness of natural meekness

36:29.417 --> 36:33.959
not artificial of a businessman but a natural one

36:34.000 --> 36:44.751
that makes you shine with your great, great spirituality.

36:44.793 --> 36:49.125
Nobody can touch you, I have told you, except for you.

36:49.167 --> 36:54.584
You can only fall down but nobody can touch you,

36:54.626 --> 36:57.626
you are all protected from every angle

36:57.668 --> 37:01.376
but if you want to hit yourself I can't help it.

37:01.376 --> 37:04.250
So again we come to Tukarama saying,

37:04.292 --> 37:10.209
as Christ has said "know thyself ".

37:10.209 --> 37:16.000
First and foremost thing of introspectionis know thyself.

37:16.042 --> 37:22.167
What you are doing,

37:22.209 --> 37:26.209
are you trying to look at yourself or not?

37:26.209 --> 37:34.626
He has also said that we see a big beam into the eyes of others,

37:34.668 --> 37:41.751
then it's all right, but the beam is in your eyes

37:41.793 --> 37:44.918
and you start seeing the beam in others eyes and that's.

37:44.958 --> 37:52.084
So in your meditation you have to sit down

37:52.125 --> 37:55.376
and first of all introspect-Oh Christ,

37:55.376 --> 37:59.918
Oh Sri Ganesha please give me wisdom to see myself

37:59.958 --> 38:06.834
and understand what's wrong with me and understand

38:06.876 --> 38:14.376
where do I lack all the qualities of a good Sahaja Yogi.

38:14.417 --> 38:21.958
Just to meditate and you feel so happy, so joyous,

38:21.959 --> 38:26.958
because virtue within you gives you joy.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.209
But you don't say I'm virtuous,

38:29.250 --> 38:32.459
you don't say that, but the virtue within you

38:32.501 --> 38:35.334
when you discover, that gives you joy

38:35.334 --> 38:42.292
and not your bad qualities and your hankerings,

38:42.334 --> 38:45.958
your lust and greed, no it does not.

38:45.959 --> 38:53.626
So we must really concentrate, even coming to Sahaja Yoga

38:53.668 --> 38:58.751
people think how I can use it for say fame,

38:58.751 --> 39:04.626
leadership you see is another myth. Then they sometimes think

39:04.668 --> 39:08.501
why not use it for making some money some how.

39:08.501 --> 39:12.042
Some sort of a business they start.

39:12.042 --> 39:17.250
Don't do any business with Sahaja Yoga or Sahaja Yogis,

39:17.292 --> 39:20.292
I've told a hundred times, if you do it you'll be in trouble

39:20.334 --> 39:22.834
and then don't come and tell me the trouble.

39:22.834 --> 39:29.125
Sahaja Yoga is only Gods business, that's all.

39:29.125 --> 39:39.376
Everything that you are doing is for God and that's why

39:39.376 --> 39:41.542
you are doing it for your self.

39:41.542 --> 39:45.084
So introspection is very important,

39:45.084 --> 39:50.250
criticising others should be less and criticising yourself

39:50.292 --> 39:52.459
and laughing at yourself is the best.

39:52.501 --> 39:53.834
I laugh at myself many a times

39:53.876 --> 39:57.376
and say many things like that, if you have noticed,

39:57.417 --> 40:06.042
that makes life so interesting. That will kill your ego.

40:06.084 --> 40:12.250
How I am trying to assert myself and where is the meekness

40:12.250 --> 40:18.542
that Christ has talked about. It is a natural goodness within us.

40:18.584 --> 40:26.626
Once it shines and shows, you become so beautiful, so loveable.

40:26.668 --> 40:29.292
Whether you are sitting here near me or there

40:29.334 --> 40:32.292
I know who is that kind.

40:32.334 --> 40:37.958
My heart just opens for such a personality.

40:37.958 --> 40:49.292
I know who they are. But even if I know I will never tell you,

40:49.334 --> 40:53.125
it is better that you know yourself.

40:53.167 --> 40:58.417
"Know thyself" is his message,

40:58.459 --> 41:03.459
in the real way not with deception because you are deceiving yourself,

41:03.459 --> 41:10.209
whom are you deceiving, know thyself without any deception,

41:10.209 --> 41:19.501
without any lies, with full concentration,

41:19.501 --> 41:26.751
see where is your attention going, that's how you are going to rise,

41:26.793 --> 41:30.417
you are not going to rise by seeing the defects of others

41:30.417 --> 41:35.542
but you are going to rise only by seeing your own defects.

41:35.542 --> 41:38.459
Exactly this what Christ has said,

41:38.501 --> 41:42.501
I am telling you in very, very simple words.

41:42.501 --> 41:48.501
Then he has said love thy neighbour as thyself which is a very,

41:48.542 --> 41:52.958
very big thing to say. Now is only possible in Sahaja Yoga

41:52.958 --> 41:58.084
because you are collective, those who are not collective

41:58.125 --> 42:01.876
how can they love their neighbour. I mean who is the neighbour then,

42:01.918 --> 42:04.167
nobody's the neighbour, they're outsiders,

42:04.167 --> 42:07.668
but as soon as you become collective,

42:07.668 --> 42:11.918
see today there are fifty five nations, you are all so collective,

42:11.918 --> 42:15.584
so moral, so beautiful, no complications, nothing,

42:15.626 --> 42:17.958
I am so overjoyed to see that

42:17.958 --> 42:21.584
but to make it perfect we should introspect.

42:21.584 --> 42:26.958
Socially, collectively you people have improved a lot

42:26.958 --> 42:29.958
but also individually within yourself

42:29.959 --> 42:33.125
you have to improve for your own goodness.

42:33.167 --> 42:39.584
So on this great occasion, we have to celebrate

42:39.584 --> 42:45.209
because really such a great amount of work was done by Christ

42:45.250 --> 42:48.167
though neutralised by these horrible priests,

42:48.167 --> 42:51.417
which is done in every country, in every religion

42:51.417 --> 42:55.459
but now we should take a vow to save others

42:55.501 --> 43:00.292
who are taking the name of Christ and doing something

43:00.334 --> 43:05.709
just the opposite. If it could be done, if it could be achieved

43:05.751 --> 43:09.876
through your lives Christ's work has been done.

43:09.876 --> 43:17.292
You have to now express Christ through your life, this is what it is.

43:17.334 --> 43:22.876
Through your life you can express it, through the purity,

43:22.918 --> 43:26.751
through the meekness, through the compassion

43:26.751 --> 43:35.459
and the wisdom of Christ. Absolutely fearless was he

43:35.459 --> 43:38.376
and that's why you have to be fearless

43:38.376 --> 43:44.125
because you have to be only afraid of God and nobody else,

43:44.125 --> 43:47.834
that's all and if you have done nothing wrong

43:47.876 --> 43:51.459
then there's nothing to be afraid of God also because he loves you very much.

43:51.459 --> 44:01.459
So be clear cut about everything, be understanding,

44:01.501 --> 44:08.626
you are all loveable people no doubt but you should be such

44:08.626 --> 44:12.207
that you can adore yourself and love yourself

44:12.232 --> 44:14.549
because of the virtues you have.

44:14.647 --> 44:18.981
May God Bless you all.
