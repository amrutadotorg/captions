00:00:01.187 --> 00:00:09.227
Today, we are celebrating Jesus Christ's birthday.

00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:19.210
His incarnation was a very great thing.

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:25.036
And, about Him,

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:31.475
there is description in the scriptures also,

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:35.278
as to how Mahavishnu's incarnation will take place in this world,

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.268
and

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:41.593
He will become the foundation of the whole world.

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:48.807
But, since the religion started taking an opposite direction,

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.511
it got diverted to various different forms,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.319
and everything got drowned into darkness and ignorance.

00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:04.747
Therefore, the unity of dharma

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:15.251
on this beautiful tree of divine power,

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:20.528
where one after another beautiful incarnations took birth,

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.780
got divided into different religions which were established.

00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:33.078
And, by taking these dead flowers,

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:39.307
human beings made their own religions and started fighting.

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:47.279
Jesus Christ is the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:49.402
and there is proof for this.

00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:53.522
About this proof I will tell you later in English.

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:58.289
But from His life we have to learn that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.922
the life of Jesus Christ was extremely pure.

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:06.348
Just like Shri Ganesha is pure,

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.337
similarly, after taking His incarnation in this world,

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:11.604
and while being in this world,

00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:14.414
He lived in complete purity,

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:18.121
because impurity just couldn't touch Him.

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:21.684
This was how extraordinary His incarnation was.

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:27.753
And because of this incarnation in this world

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:34.561
a very big event took place,

00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:39.896
that our Agnya chakra got opened.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.031
As He was crucified on the cross,

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:49.190
our Agnya chakra got opened

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:51.978
and this was a great boon granted by Him.

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:53.868
He had to do this so He did it

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.704
and for Him it was just a play.

00:02:56.905 --> 00:03:01.651
At a very young age, He did all this work.

00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:06.386
But this led to so much of overturn and alter of Christianity,

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.184
that people can't understand,

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:13.889
how people who consider the pure life of Jesus Christ,

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:17.077
as their foundation,

00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:20.629
can be so low level (gross).

00:03:22.131 --> 00:03:25.055
This is the reason why the religion became distorted.

00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:26.431
Similarly in our country also,

00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:29.301
several distorted forms of Hindu religion have emerged,

00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:31.239
among which are tantrics,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.249
and different kinds of people in our country (India),

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.506
have in the streets, in the temples and everywhere

00:03:36.707 --> 00:03:40.369
done very vulgar jobs in a dirty way.

00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:43.576
They have spoilt the temples too

00:03:43.777 --> 00:03:48.249
and the whole belief of religion has been turned upside-down.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.436
Regarding this I just have to say,

00:03:53.637 --> 00:03:56.797
that all these incarnations have done so much work and left,

00:03:56.998 --> 00:04:00.358
and they have taken so much effort,

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:05.086
and whatever they have constructed, is the tree of your Kundalini.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.167
And  the most important of this tree, the Agnya chakra,

00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:13.028
was opened by Jesus Christ, by His sacrifices.

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.913
We owe a lot to Him.

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:22.451
I must have said lots of things about Christ before,

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:27.883
and how Jesus Christ is related to Shri Radhaji,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.974
that He is the incarnation of

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.403
Sri Ganesha who was the son of the Adi Shakti to begin with.

00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:41.417
But then he was given to Shri Radhaji

00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:48.209
and Shri Radha created as Mahalaxmi, as Mother Mary,

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:50.916
this great incarnation of Christ.

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:52.944
Now for,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.709
the western mind it is impossible to understand

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.410
how there can be a immaculate conception

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:03.437
because they have no sense at all no sensitivity at all

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:04.897
to spiritual life.

00:05:05.098 --> 00:05:06.715
We Indians can understand it,

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.918
is very easy for Indians to understand

00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:13.294
because we had Sri Ganesha created that way.

00:05:13.495 --> 00:05:15.937
We just believe it we don't doubt these things.

00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:18.549
Whatever is said about God is not to be doubted,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.258
with this limited brain,

00:05:20.657 --> 00:05:22.202
that's not done in India.

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:27.387
But in the west, from the very birth of Christ

00:05:28.198 --> 00:05:32.231
they have had arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments with this

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:37.669
limited brain they had, and the whole religion in the name of Christ

00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:43.595
is just a perversion, such a horrible things have been said

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.934
that it's unbelievable.

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:52.771
His purity, his holiness, his auspiciousness

00:05:53.198 --> 00:05:55.575
is never understood in the west I think.

00:05:55.893 --> 00:06:01.303
Those who follow Christianity, how can they be so

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.772
debased in their moral character.

00:06:04.794 --> 00:06:07.327
They're all right for their political,

00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:12.077
their economical you can say, their legal side,

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:16.557
but their moral sense is absolutely missing, Is very surprising,

00:06:16.758 --> 00:06:18.772
those who are the followers of Christ

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:23.470
should have the greatest amount of morality.

00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:31.512
He has said that thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,

00:06:31.962 --> 00:06:36.623
such a subtle thing, even the eye should not have adultery,

00:06:37.902 --> 00:06:41.182
should not have lust and greed.

00:06:42.312 --> 00:06:44.712
Such a subtle thing he has said it,

00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:50.038
and just think in the west people could not follow it

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:53.238
because the whole religion got perverted

00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:58.164
under the influence of Paul and Peter.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.634
It's a very serious thing they have done against Christ

00:07:02.872 --> 00:07:04.207
it's still going on.

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.791
Still this Catholic church, though being exposed so much,

00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:10.071
is still going on, in India also

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.991
all over, is stupid,

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:15.313
this Protestant church also is going on everywhere.

00:07:16.215 --> 00:07:18.839
What good name have they brought to Christ?

00:07:19.157 --> 00:07:20.308
One should see.

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:24.244
The first and foremost thing he has said

00:07:24.976 --> 00:07:26.876
that you must

00:07:29.352 --> 00:07:31.352
enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.626
that you must be born again.

00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:36.970
So it's all mental, you are born again,

00:07:37.171 --> 00:07:40.154
you have a certificate, you are born again, finished.

00:07:41.337 --> 00:07:47.458
So this mental attitude of the west is responsible

00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:55.301
for killing the great incarnation of Christ,

00:07:55.502 --> 00:07:57.834
I think is another crucifixion.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.649
Mentally you cannot understand spirituality.

00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:05.823
So they were telling your brain trust, brain trust,

00:08:06.024 --> 00:08:09.709
I said brain trusting-I can't understand in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:18.711
In Sahaja Yoga what is the brain trust? Where is the brain?

00:08:25.052 --> 00:08:27.417
In thoughtless awareness where is the brain?

00:08:29.941 --> 00:08:32.795
So this brain trust business might be all right for any other place

00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:35.348
but for Sahaja Yoga, I still don't understand

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.635
what do you do in brain trust.

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:40.909
Because some people want to come on the stage and speak you see,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.338
they have a kind of a

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.576
madness, they can't get over it.

00:08:51.003 --> 00:08:54.207
So they might be coming to the brain trust maybe,

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:59.603
but it's not brain, it's the heart,

00:09:01.894 --> 00:09:03.263
is the heart,

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.468
which has to be opened out.

00:09:08.008 --> 00:09:13.757
because with the brain, what we do is all kinds of materialism.

00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:18.876
All kinds of nonsense has come from human brain only,

00:09:19.377 --> 00:09:21.412
not so much from animals brain.

00:09:23.182 --> 00:09:27.270
You can see, if you go to any forest,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.088
it's clean, nice smelling so well

00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:33.169
but put one human being there and you will know,

00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:38.606
that this filth, dirt has come from some human being.

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:42.309
So as it is they have made a mess,

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:47.545
of all the great incarnations but,

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:50.612
worst is done to Christ and I feel,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.826
what a waste it was.

00:09:56.004 --> 00:10:00.642
So we must understand Christ in the right sense,

00:10:01.511 --> 00:10:03.903
he is the eternal child,

00:10:04.642 --> 00:10:09.597
he is the innocence itself, he's the source of innocence

00:10:10.056 --> 00:10:14.716
and he is the bestower of all blessings in all chakras.

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:18.921
But that doesn't mean that you are Christians,

00:10:19.122 --> 00:10:20.969
you should be very proud.

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:23.192
that oh she's talking about Christ,

00:10:23.393 --> 00:10:28.152
Many I've seen Sahaja Yogis are still identified with Christ

00:10:28.938 --> 00:10:31.597
while they have nothing to do with Christ at all.

00:10:38.102 --> 00:10:41.398
Now one has to understand that how,

00:10:41.797 --> 00:10:45.266
Christ in His miraculous life, has shown so many miracles.

00:10:47.115 --> 00:10:50.598
First of all his birth was immaculate.

00:10:52.648 --> 00:10:57.498
Every kind of birth is immaculate, they are beyond sins.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.527
They are special people.

00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:02.437
They may come as human beings, they may come as angels,

00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:04.310
they may come as anything,

00:11:04.786 --> 00:11:07.976
they are divine and we should understand

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:11.768
that this little brain of ours cannot discuss about them

00:11:11.974 --> 00:11:17.911
and talk about them but is to just surrender and worship them.

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:21.473
They are much beyond us.

00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:27.073
So for the western mind, it is important

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:30.757
to understand that the life of Christ was

00:11:31.074 --> 00:11:33.448
such a blessing for them,

00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:36.407
that they have lost it, they have wasted it

00:11:36.774 --> 00:11:39.545
and they have never understood how to respect it.

00:11:43.113 --> 00:11:44.517
The whole thing became,

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:50.458
aannn like a political, economical, nonsensical fraud.

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:57.082
I have told you long time back

00:11:58.368 --> 00:12:02.349
that how we can prove that Christ was Ganesha

00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:05.214
and he was the logos, he was the

00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:09.381
what we call is the Brahmanad, the first sound.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:17.310
By looking at your left side from the right side,

00:12:18.627 --> 00:12:22.277
if you see the Mooladhara you will see swastikas

00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:25.412
because it is made of carbon atom.

00:12:26.618 --> 00:12:30.381
If you see from left to the right, you can see Omkara.

00:12:31.488 --> 00:12:37.543
and if you see from down upward, it looks like Alpha and Omega.

00:12:38.376 --> 00:12:43.008
In those days Christ has said I am the Alpha and I am the Omega

00:12:43.452 --> 00:12:45.897
and now we have made the animation, we have no arrangement

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:49.405
to show you there, I don't know if you could arrange it somehow,

00:12:49.762 --> 00:12:54.225
but you can see it clearly, what I have said can be proved.

00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:00.543
So as you worship Ganesha you must worship Christ

00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:04.185
in the same manner for all those who worship Ganesha.

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:08.401
Because I have seen that Hindus, they are stuck to Ganesha

00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:12.659
and Christians are stuck to Christ,

00:13:16.273 --> 00:13:20.057
even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they carry those traits.

00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:22.602
Ganesha is all right up to a point

00:13:23.475 --> 00:13:27.533
and then it is important we must pray

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:31.364
to his incarnation that is Christ.

00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:36.168
In the same way those who worship Christ must also

00:13:36.652 --> 00:13:39.700
worship Ganesha because he is the source,

00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:43.922
he is the potential of Christ.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:50.164
All this was in the Divine plan, done with Divine discretion,

00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:53.982
everything was done so beautifully but as I told you

00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:57.647
human beings are good at massacring anything that is beautiful

00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:02.131
and that's how it has happened, It's very, very sad,

00:14:02.503 --> 00:14:05.365
and on his birthday today we have to decide

00:14:05.566 --> 00:14:09.809
that he is to be born within us again, in a proper way,

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.807
that he is the Alpha and the Omega.

00:14:14.347 --> 00:14:16.379
At that time of his time,

00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:20.095
I didn't know that anybody knew about these symbols.

00:14:20.613 --> 00:14:24.061
These symbols also must have come from unconscious,

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:28.629
to some of the great mathematicians in long time

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:35.013
and that's why these symbols are used exactly like Alpha and Omega,

00:14:35.214 --> 00:14:37.513
you see him clearly.

00:14:39.887 --> 00:14:42.149
It is so clear cut now in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:46.285
we can prove so many things all tangible;

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:50.048
how Christ used to cure people, what did he do,

00:14:50.286 --> 00:14:54.032
it's all tangible, we can prove it now in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:54.731 --> 00:14:57.974
how it works out, how these powers work out,

00:14:58.562 --> 00:15:01.109
but we have to first of all

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:06.622
cleanse our lives, we have to lead a very honest,

00:15:06.892 --> 00:15:09.601
powerful and pure life.

00:15:11.522 --> 00:15:13.684
I've seen those stalls outside,

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:17.749
I told them not to put up any stalls here.

00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:21.891
Because they are making profit for themselves not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:26.880
Once Christ saw like that and he took a hunter and hit all of them,

00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:28.578
now I can't do that.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.341
One should not encourage these people,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.591
it's not a shopping centre, you have come for meditation.

00:15:39.361 --> 00:15:41.141
Is all right if you need anything

00:15:41.342 --> 00:15:43.395
we have bought things for you, if you buy them,

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:45.540
there might be little profit, may not be,

00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:47.279
but that will go to Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:52.224
is not going to be used for any private purpose.

00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:55.492
But these people from outside come and put up a stall,

00:15:55.706 --> 00:15:57.075
and you all run about means

00:15:57.276 --> 00:15:58.969
you are still hanging around with that thing,

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.671
you have come here for what?

00:16:07.506 --> 00:16:10.628
One should be all the time meditative in Ganapatipule,

00:16:12.151 --> 00:16:15.166
all the time you should be in a meditative condition

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:18.317
and shouldn't get to these mundane things

00:16:18.518 --> 00:16:21.017
which you always do outside also.

00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:26.219
But these people know, that you still have those weaknesses,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.342
that's why they have put up the stalls.

00:16:33.212 --> 00:16:35.644
Leaders should stop all this nonsense,

00:16:35.922 --> 00:16:37.628
I've told not to eat outside.

00:16:37.858 --> 00:16:40.191
Last time all of you suffered because of that

00:16:40.593 --> 00:16:42.431
but still the stalls are on,

00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:45.883
that means see they know there are some culprits who would like to

00:16:46.781 --> 00:16:51.152
buy things from them and get sick and bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:56.311
So the first thing of Ganesha is that wisdom,

00:17:00.668 --> 00:17:03.977
and that wisdom we see in the life of Christ.

00:17:04.469 --> 00:17:08.779
From the very beginning, he was so confident of it,

00:17:09.215 --> 00:17:14.584
that at the age of twelve years he went and talked to these

00:17:15.422 --> 00:17:18.228
farsis, means the people who were priests,

00:17:18.477 --> 00:17:21.890
we still have priests and mullahs and these burgees,

00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:27.324
and all of them, these so called dharmamantandas, all over.

00:17:28.783 --> 00:17:32.925
But he went and argued with them at that young age

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.827
and he was just saying "what are you doing here"?

00:17:40.468 --> 00:17:45.041
What is this? What are you talking, all lip service?

00:17:47.072 --> 00:17:49.390
He was discussing and talking to them

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:52.675
but his parents were perhaps, were frightened

00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:54.936
that these people might kill him,

00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:58.558
so they brought him to India, he came to India for wisdom.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.627
I don't know where is that wisdom missing now from Indians,

00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:05.563
but must be this country was full of wisdom,

00:18:05.764 --> 00:18:07.628
when he came and stayed in India

00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:11.249
and we have lots of

00:18:13.654 --> 00:18:15.701
memories about him, even

00:18:16.326 --> 00:18:20.249
the King Shaliman met him, is described in his book

00:18:20.606 --> 00:18:22.773
that he met a man in Kashmir,

00:18:23.368 --> 00:18:27.098
who was very saintly and he asked him what's your name?

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:29.569
He said my name is Isa,

00:18:31.783 --> 00:18:33.917
see now imagine-Isa.

00:18:34.229 --> 00:18:38.323
I is the word used in the Vedas for the Adi Shakti-

00:18:40.363 --> 00:18:41.340
Sa means with.

00:18:42.229 --> 00:18:46.801
He said my name is Isa, he said from what country do you come?

00:18:47.512 --> 00:18:49.715
He said I come from a country,

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:53.271
which is foreign to me and this is my country.

00:18:55.372 --> 00:18:58.530
So this India, the Bharat, the Hindustan

00:18:59.141 --> 00:19:01.345
was the country of spirituality.

00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:03.947
and one should not try

00:19:04.334 --> 00:19:07.218
to compete and feel inferior to other countries,

00:19:07.512 --> 00:19:10.099
who have gone up materially higher,

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.408
you don't know where they are.

00:19:15.207 --> 00:19:17.571
But we should be spiritually higher,

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:22.835
that's what Christ said, this is my own country,

00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:26.432
is clearly written, that means Christ recognised

00:19:26.811 --> 00:19:30.585
that this country of spirituality is his own.

00:19:32.236 --> 00:19:36.371
So we belong to that country of spirituality

00:19:36.572 --> 00:19:38.607
and not to the materialistic,

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:43.607
or to the mundane or the baser type of life.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.315
In his life time which was so very short,

00:19:55.966 --> 00:20:00.150
whatever he has said, every word is great

00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:02.705
but as I told you that

00:20:03.134 --> 00:20:10.138
this Paul tried to completely change, re-edit the bible and he's

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.961
put lots of things in there,

00:20:13.162 --> 00:20:16.487
whatever weaknesses he has, he has put them nicely.

00:20:17.171 --> 00:20:21.010
Now recently I've got a book, which was

00:20:22.796 --> 00:20:26.058
hidden in a jar in Egypt for about,

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:28.741
till fifty years they discovered it,

00:20:29.907 --> 00:20:32.698
and this book is called as the Library of Hamadhi.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:35.969
The place was called Hamadhi were it was discovered,

00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:39.556
and what Christ has said, what Thomas has written,

00:20:39.776 --> 00:20:41.367
when Thomas was coming to India,

00:20:41.605 --> 00:20:44.412
he put all these things there, is very interesting.

00:20:44.668 --> 00:20:48.332
About drinking, he said drinking begets debauchery,

00:20:48.533 --> 00:20:52.909
it's a bad word to use and while Christians don't know.

00:20:54.417 --> 00:20:56.181
On the contrary they think,

00:20:56.454 --> 00:21:00.378
that drinking is allowed in Christianity, very nicely.

00:21:00.765 --> 00:21:02.898
Was he mad to allow drinking?

00:21:07.695 --> 00:21:11.704
How can he allow drinking which goes against your awareness,

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:14.420
but they thought it was nice,

00:21:14.991 --> 00:21:18.721
and that's what people have been using

00:21:18.922 --> 00:21:23.558
as a big attraction, that you can drink in Christianity.

00:21:26.144 --> 00:21:30.306
So in the other religion, like Catholic religion, you could have

00:21:30.932 --> 00:21:32.503
only once the Marriage.

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:37.354
So they have one marriage and ten keeps,

00:21:37.574 --> 00:21:40.484
is all right, allowed, in the bible is written,

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:44.996
only you can have one marriage you cannot divorce, do what you like.

00:21:45.206 --> 00:21:47.185
No sense of morality

00:21:48.267 --> 00:21:54.236
and everything came like a derailment towards themselves

00:21:54.728 --> 00:21:58.293
and they accepted one after another, all kinds of nonsense,

00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:03.682
and the basic thing of Christ's life is morality.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.974
He is on the left side as you can see he's from Sri Ganesh

00:22:09.548 --> 00:22:12.403
and then he establishes himself at Agnya,

00:22:14.649 --> 00:22:17.956
but morality is the essence of his life,

00:22:21.115 --> 00:22:24.121
what we call in Indian language is character.

00:22:25.423 --> 00:22:32.388
Our character is how we lead a life of purity.

00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:37.073
We indulge into all kinds of nonsense,

00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:41.538
I mean if you go to the west you'll be amazed what things they do.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.020
I mean you cannot even believe it and

00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:48.855
I cannot even mention it to you,

00:22:49.056 --> 00:22:51.915
you won't believe that these so called

00:22:52.123 --> 00:22:55.313
advanced countries are advancing towards what.

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:59.178
Impossible we cannot conceive it even,

00:23:01.935 --> 00:23:03.586
such an impurity,

00:23:05.787 --> 00:23:06.836
such a

00:23:08.503 --> 00:23:09.828
horrible,

00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:14.670
destructive immorality,

00:23:15.209 --> 00:23:16.549
and I don't know from where it comes,

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.793
I think it's something wrong with the genetics,

00:23:18.994 --> 00:23:21.371
from where do they get these ideas.

00:23:22.474 --> 00:23:23.768
One after another,

00:23:24.442 --> 00:23:26.969
it's impossible to believe

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:31.699
these people doing all these things and then nicely dress up

00:23:32.152 --> 00:23:36.082
and go to church on Sunday, pray to God and come back.

00:23:39.109 --> 00:23:41.200
Now it is for you to decide,

00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:44.700
you have to pull out all these people in your own countries

00:23:45.054 --> 00:23:46.537
and you have to tell them,

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:52.175
this is all nonsense in the name of Christ, in the name of God.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.875
You have to come up and talk about it,

00:23:58.542 --> 00:24:00.069
same about Sri Ganesh.

00:24:00.784 --> 00:24:03.112
I have seen in Poona, I was surprised,

00:24:03.552 --> 00:24:05.228
there was Ganesh mahotsav.

00:24:05.943 --> 00:24:08.367
everybody was drinking nicely,

00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:10.768
the horrible dirty songs,

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:15.892
some western songs, some horrible cinema songs put up there

00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:21.517
and everybody was using as a disco, in front of Sri Ganesh.

00:24:23.386 --> 00:24:24.612
Sahaja Yogis should go and object

00:24:24.813 --> 00:24:26.569
to this kind of a nonsense they are in,

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.170
that how could they drink in the presence of Sri Ganesh.

00:24:35.144 --> 00:24:41.446
No wisdom of Sri Ganesha, no respect for his auspiciousness.

00:24:42.628 --> 00:24:45.802
Now not only drinking, doing all kinds of things.

00:24:46.596 --> 00:24:47.926
Sri Ganesha has

00:24:48.345 --> 00:24:52.116
been shown by these tantrikas as something so horrible

00:24:53.072 --> 00:24:58.758
which is also done by so many psychologists, so called in the west.

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:03.237
Thank God one of them is Mr. Freud is exposed now.

00:25:05.318 --> 00:25:10.487
So the another quality of Ganesha, is shown in Christ's life,

00:25:11.334 --> 00:25:13.234
is a devotion to Mother.

00:25:15.016 --> 00:25:16.016
In that

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.717
book

00:25:19.822 --> 00:25:24.367
the Mary is telling them about knowledge,

00:25:26.122 --> 00:25:29.314
But this Paul objects to it,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.988
and she says that this is what you have to achieve.

00:25:36.825 --> 00:25:39.841
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with her,

00:25:41.023 --> 00:25:48.652
but then Thomas said that what Christ has said on the Cross

00:25:48.912 --> 00:25:50.786
"behold the Mother".

00:25:53.922 --> 00:25:56.044
She is the Mother of Christ

00:25:56.542 --> 00:25:59.387
and how dare he insult her.

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:03.752
But just the opposite, Paul never respected women,

00:26:05.062 --> 00:26:08.920
so he appointed,

00:26:11.355 --> 00:26:14.078
I mean he called her as just a woman.

00:26:14.767 --> 00:26:18.340
No respect for Mahalaxmi, no respect.

00:26:22.138 --> 00:26:24.831
Can you imagine, just a woman,

00:26:25.164 --> 00:26:30.402
and a big controversy going on these so called advanced people

00:26:30.871 --> 00:26:34.452
whether the women should be ordained as priests or not.

00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:36.962
We think we are very backward

00:26:37.163 --> 00:26:41.991
but I think they are so backward in religion, nonsense.

00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:45.598
We had Gargi, Mythreyi, such people here

00:26:46.344 --> 00:26:48.268
and we respect the Mother

00:26:49.419 --> 00:26:53.360
as the Adi Shakti, she is the one we call her,

00:26:54.022 --> 00:26:57.974
the one who has created us, she is the one who looks after us,

00:26:58.601 --> 00:27:01.303
for us she is important, Shakti is important,

00:27:01.709 --> 00:27:04.835
they don't call her Shakti but a woman,

00:27:08.383 --> 00:27:11.514
and supposed to be very advanced people,

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.460
and all other nonsense they do in the name of advancement.

00:27:19.032 --> 00:27:21.159
It's impossible to tell,

00:27:21.944 --> 00:27:27.443
my words fall short, feel so ashamed

00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:30.026
in the name of Christ.

00:27:31.311 --> 00:27:38.220
Today now when we are celebrating the pure life of Christ,

00:27:38.522 --> 00:27:40.030
he came on this earth.

00:27:41.387 --> 00:27:44.375
They can't believe that he could have been so pure.

00:27:45.795 --> 00:27:49.129
A criminal cannot believe that others could be non criminal.

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:59.659
So we have to within ourselves see if we have developed

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:06.153
that purity of mind that expresses through our eyes.

00:28:06.823 --> 00:28:12.066
Eyes have to become innocent, otherwise they have no effect.

00:28:14.947 --> 00:28:18.677
If you are hankering after attracting other people

00:28:18.878 --> 00:28:21.573
and charming other people and all that,

00:28:21.898 --> 00:28:24.232
you are not a Sahaja Yogi, there's no need.

00:28:25.256 --> 00:28:28.430
Once the light is within yourself, people will know.

00:28:31.748 --> 00:28:34.572
As Sahaja Yogis you have to have,

00:28:34.773 --> 00:28:38.653
the light of Christ in your own life.

00:28:39.964 --> 00:28:45.758
He was a young man who came on this earth, and how he lived.

00:28:47.323 --> 00:28:51.871
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalen, who was a prostitute,

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:57.013
But he stood by truth, and when people started stoning her

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.612
he stood up and said those who have not committed any sin

00:29:03.564 --> 00:29:05.342
can throw the stone at me.

00:29:05.564 --> 00:29:07.863
What a strength of truth.

00:29:09.234 --> 00:29:13.821
So not that only he was a pure personality,

00:29:14.091 --> 00:29:20.793
but purity also is expressed in truth and his compassion and love.

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:27.157
Such compassion he has expressed, such compassion.

00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:31.463
I think Sri Ganesha got a little transformation.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.701
Sri Ganesha is definitely very compassionate to people

00:29:37.336 --> 00:29:40.001
who are worshipping him

00:29:41.183 --> 00:29:46.485
But those who go against Him, he hits them hard, He doesn't care.

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:52.907
They have to suffer, aids, this, that, everything comes.

00:29:55.469 --> 00:30:00.448
But those who are pure people, Sri Ganesha protects.

00:30:00.988 --> 00:30:03.885
But Christ is compassionate, he forgives.

00:30:04.591 --> 00:30:07.632
Because he believes that there could be a transformation.

00:30:09.211 --> 00:30:12.322
At the level of Sri Ganesha,

00:30:13.608 --> 00:30:18.249
He thinks is better that let them be killed and be born again

00:30:19.491 --> 00:30:21.086
because they're so impure.

00:30:21.364 --> 00:30:24.975
but Christ had hopes that he can transform people,

00:30:25.475 --> 00:30:29.221
but he could not, they crucified him.

00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:34.922
What wonderful people they must have been to crucify Christ.

00:30:36.176 --> 00:30:40.835
Brainless we should call them, absolutely

00:30:41.168 --> 00:30:44.743
without any understanding about spirituality,

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:51.746
very insensitive to true knowledge.

00:30:55.285 --> 00:30:59.154
So for Sahaja Yoga, only the wise can follow.

00:30:59.781 --> 00:31:03.257
It is not meant for stupid idiotic people,

00:31:03.503 --> 00:31:06.746
nor it is meant for very smart ones.

00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:10.381
Some people think they are very smart

00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:12.711
because they are successful in life,

00:31:12.912 --> 00:31:15.305
they can say some smart sentences,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.958
they can say something very, outstandingly very sharp,

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.942
it's not meant for that.

00:31:23.617 --> 00:31:28.836
For that Christ has said meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:36.125
Meek in heart, not those who think too much of themselves

00:31:36.419 --> 00:31:40.301
but for meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:31:41.103 --> 00:31:45.103
Among Sahaja Yogis also only those who are meek in heart

00:31:45.357 --> 00:31:49.270
will inherit the blessing of Mother.

00:31:50.834 --> 00:31:52.214
You have to be meek,

00:31:53.952 --> 00:31:57.584
you have to be wise and with wisdom you'll become meek

00:31:58.164 --> 00:32:02.624
Because then you will see where are we into this great cosmos,

00:32:04.195 --> 00:32:09.887
that, you will feel that you have entered into this Kingdom of God,

00:32:10.414 --> 00:32:15.082
for what? How? How have we come here?

00:32:15.871 --> 00:32:17.744
How have you entered here?

00:32:19.228 --> 00:32:25.059
So many tried, thousands of years sacrificing this sacrificing that,

00:32:25.385 --> 00:32:27.917
standing on their heads, fasting,

00:32:28.266 --> 00:32:30.684
how is it suddenly we got this blessing?

00:32:31.692 --> 00:32:32.902
How are we there?

00:32:35.311 --> 00:32:39.216
When we start looking at this we become meek.

00:32:40.088 --> 00:32:42.369
Is the blessing, is the grace.

00:32:43.234 --> 00:32:46.023
It's not through our ego, through our conditionings

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:48.459
but is just the grace,

00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:52.400
the compassion, the love the Sandrakaruna,

00:32:56.348 --> 00:33:00.538
and then you enjoy your transformed life,

00:33:01.855 --> 00:33:08.829
the new dimension of spirituality which is in reality.

00:33:09.377 --> 00:33:12.440
Now you know reality, you know totality, you know everything

00:33:12.707 --> 00:33:17.263
but those who have not known themselves have not become SahajaYogis.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:27.336
Tukarama has said in very simple words 'aapanachi jaanile jani'

00:33:27.963 --> 00:33:30.884
the one who has known himself is the last one.

00:33:33.363 --> 00:33:35.261
You can judge the chakras of others

00:33:35.462 --> 00:33:37.673
but you can't judge your own chakras,

00:33:38.378 --> 00:33:39.563
you can introspect others,

00:33:39.764 --> 00:33:42.561
you can judge others but you cannot judge yourself.

00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:44.257
You know everything about others,

00:33:44.458 --> 00:33:46.843
but about yourself you don't know anything,

00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:50.081
then you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:50.547 --> 00:33:52.337
First thing you must know yourself.

00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:55.527
What sort of an ego stuff I am doing.

00:33:55.793 --> 00:33:57.948
What sort of a conditioning I have got?

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.621
Even now people have so many conditionings.

00:34:02.296 --> 00:34:04.708
So there's a new discipline of Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:05.335 --> 00:34:10.636
in the new discipline you have to be meek, humble and

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.580
you have to be wise.

00:34:14.687 --> 00:34:18.000
Every step of yours, every talk of yours,

00:34:18.987 --> 00:34:21.394
everything should express wisdom

00:34:22.338 --> 00:34:23.826
and the Sahaj discipline,

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:27.251
which automatically stops you from doing wrong things.

00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:31.596
Now say I'm walking down and some lady suddenly falls at my feet

00:34:32.152 --> 00:34:35.620
without even understanding that I am just walking, I may fall down

00:34:37.598 --> 00:34:39.156
or catches hold of my feet,

00:34:40.355 --> 00:34:42.895
is all self oriented.

00:34:43.855 --> 00:34:47.843
I should see Mother, I should go and meet her,

00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:50.772
I touched her feet, is all ego.

00:34:54.288 --> 00:34:57.042
A Sahaja Yogi stands in the back,

00:34:57.583 --> 00:34:59.685
real Sahaja Yogi is at the back

00:35:01.543 --> 00:35:05.447
from there he can enjoy because he knows I am everywhere.

00:35:07.482 --> 00:35:11.982
He doesn't want to see me, nothing, just like this, standing.

00:35:15.128 --> 00:35:17.544
He doesn't force his way in any way.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.939
Mother is here.

00:35:23.462 --> 00:35:28.231
But this is what it is Christ has said, meek in heart.

00:35:28.918 --> 00:35:32.481
There's a very big word "meek" and people don't understand meek

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:35.388
because in the west if you are meek people say you are weak,

00:35:35.602 --> 00:35:37.021
you have to be aggressive.

00:35:37.222 --> 00:35:38.546
if they have to praise somebody they'll say,

00:35:38.747 --> 00:35:40.975
oh he is very good, he is very aggressive.

00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:45.371
I think their genetics are little lower than normal,

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.331
must be some animals in them

00:35:49.791 --> 00:35:52.471
otherwise how can they think that to be aggressive,

00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:55.060
is being something higher.

00:35:56.066 --> 00:35:57.104
It's impossible.

00:35:58.644 --> 00:36:02.065
how can a person who is

00:36:03.716 --> 00:36:07.655
supposed to be a higher person, could be like a devil?

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:12.550
How could Hitler say that he was a higher race

00:36:12.751 --> 00:36:14.779
when he was himself a devil?

00:36:15.985 --> 00:36:18.651
Is very nice for a devil to say I am a higher race.

00:36:22.382 --> 00:36:26.996
So in dealing in Sahaja Yoga, the sweetness of

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:33.631
natural meekness not artificial of a businessman but a natural one

00:36:35.545 --> 00:36:43.356
that makes you shine with your great, great spirituality.

00:36:44.933 --> 00:36:48.966
Nobody can touch you, I have told you, except for you.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.417
You can only fall down

00:36:52.124 --> 00:36:56.624
but nobody can touch you, you are all protected from every angle

00:36:57.155 --> 00:37:00.549
but if you want to hit yourself I can't help it.

00:37:01.438 --> 00:37:03.764
So again we come to Tukarama saying,

00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:07.713
as Christ has said "know thyself ".

00:37:10.102 --> 00:37:15.173
First and foremost thing of introspectionis know thyself.

00:37:20.252 --> 00:37:21.792
What you are doing,

00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:25.126
are you trying to look at yourself or not?

00:37:25.991 --> 00:37:30.324
He has also said that we see a big beam,

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:34.626
into the eyes of others,

00:37:36.805 --> 00:37:40.514
then it's all right, but the beam is in your eyes

00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:45.427
and you start seeing the beam in others eyes and that's the point.

00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:51.697
So in your meditation you have to sit down

00:37:51.898 --> 00:37:54.761
and first of all introspect-Oh Christ,

00:37:55.578 --> 00:37:59.733
Oh Sri Ganesha please give me wisdom to see myself

00:38:00.081 --> 00:38:02.963
and understand what's wrong with me,

00:38:05.653 --> 00:38:08.333
and understand where do I lack,

00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:13.738
all the qualities of a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:38:16.296 --> 00:38:21.388
Just to meditate and you feel so happy, so joyous,

00:38:22.663 --> 00:38:26.036
because virtue within you gives you joy.

00:38:27.041 --> 00:38:29.509
But you don't say I'm virtuous, you don't say that,

00:38:30.622 --> 00:38:34.891
but the virtue within you when you discover, that gives you joy

00:38:35.092 --> 00:38:42.200
and not your bad qualities and your hankerings,

00:38:42.454 --> 00:38:45.311
your lust and greed, no it does not.

00:38:47.478 --> 00:38:51.539
So we must really concentrate,

00:38:52.182 --> 00:38:54.036
even coming to Sahaja Yoga people think,

00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:58.550
how I can use it for say AAAA fame,

00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:01.854
leadership you see is another myth.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.521
Then they sometimes think,

00:39:04.783 --> 00:39:07.864
why not use it for making some money some how.

00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:11.457
Some sort of a business they start.

00:39:11.783 --> 00:39:16.465
Don't do any business with Sahaja Yoga or Sahaja Yogis,

00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:19.727
I've told a hundred times, if you do it you'll be in trouble

00:39:20.334 --> 00:39:22.633
and then don't come and tell me the trouble.

00:39:24.203 --> 00:39:28.419
Sahaja Yoga is only Gods business, that's all.

00:39:32.562 --> 00:39:36.573
Everything that you are doing is for God

00:39:37.399 --> 00:39:40.660
and that's why you are doing it for your self.

00:39:42.272 --> 00:39:44.690
So introspection is very important,

00:39:45.976 --> 00:39:48.087
criticising others should be less,

00:39:48.524 --> 00:39:51.563
and criticising yourself and laughing at yourself is the best.

00:39:51.764 --> 00:39:53.473
I laugh at myself many a times

00:39:53.674 --> 00:39:56.362
and say many things like that, if you have noticed,

00:39:56.806 --> 00:39:58.745
that makes life so interesting.

00:40:03.793 --> 00:40:05.491
That will kill your ego.

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:10.034
How I am trying to assert myself,

00:40:10.539 --> 00:40:13.603
and where is the meekness that Christ has talked about.

00:40:15.389 --> 00:40:18.206
It is a natural goodness within us.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.882
Once it shines and shows,

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:26.017
you become so beautiful, so loveable.

00:40:26.278 --> 00:40:28.794
Whether you are sitting here near me or there

00:40:28.995 --> 00:40:30.713
I know who is that kind.

00:40:31.975 --> 00:40:37.192
My heart just opens for such a personality.

00:40:37.848 --> 00:40:39.553
I know who they are.

00:40:46.236 --> 00:40:49.036
But even if I know I will never tell you,

00:40:49.766 --> 00:40:52.234
it is better that you know yourself.

00:40:53.803 --> 00:40:58.097
"Know thyself" is his message,

00:40:58.684 --> 00:41:00.121
in the real way,

00:41:00.415 --> 00:41:02.851
not with deception because you are deceiving yourself,

00:41:03.052 --> 00:41:04.419
whom are you deceiving?

00:41:05.959 --> 00:41:09.832
know thyself without any deception,

00:41:14.409 --> 00:41:18.813
without any lies, with full concentration,

00:41:21.472 --> 00:41:26.751
see where is your attention going, that's how you are going to rise,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.114
you are not going to rise by seeing the defects of others

00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:33.527
but you are going to rise only by seeing your own defects.

00:41:35.542 --> 00:41:37.912
Exactly this what Christ has said,

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.547
I am telling you in very, very simple words.

00:41:43.531 --> 00:41:46.952
Then he has said love thy neighbour as thyself

00:41:47.365 --> 00:41:49.960
which is a very, very big thing to say.

00:41:50.206 --> 00:41:52.390
Now is only possible in Sahaja Yoga

00:41:52.958 --> 00:41:55.101
because you are collective,

00:41:56.617 --> 00:41:59.490
those who are not collective how can they love their neighbour.

00:41:59.689 --> 00:42:01.070
I mean who is the neighbour then,

00:42:01.316 --> 00:42:03.582
nobody's the neighbour, they're outsiders,

00:42:05.177 --> 00:42:07.467
but as soon as you become collective,

00:42:07.668 --> 00:42:11.278
see today there are fifty five nations, you are all so collective,

00:42:11.479 --> 00:42:13.342
so moral, so beautiful,

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.955
no complications, nothing, I am so overjoyed to see that

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.343
but to make it perfect we should introspect.

00:42:23.323 --> 00:42:26.757
Socially, collectively you people have improved a lot

00:42:27.006 --> 00:42:29.758
but also individually within yourself

00:42:30.033 --> 00:42:32.748
you have to improve for your own goodness.

00:42:36.129 --> 00:42:39.311
So on this great occasion, we have to celebrate

00:42:39.512 --> 00:42:44.804
because really such a great amount of work was done by Christ

00:42:45.027 --> 00:42:47.562
though neutralised by these horrible priests,

00:42:47.769 --> 00:42:51.012
which is done in every country, in every religion

00:42:51.515 --> 00:42:55.459
but now we should take a vow to save others

00:42:56.964 --> 00:42:58.933
who are taking the name of Christ,

00:42:59.134 --> 00:43:01.224
and doing something just the opposite.

00:43:01.552 --> 00:43:05.342
If it could be done, if it could be achieved

00:43:05.564 --> 00:43:09.157
through your lives Christ's work has been done.

00:43:09.396 --> 00:43:16.817
You have to now express Christ through your life, this is what it is.

00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:22.587
Through your life you can express it, through the purity,

00:43:23.222 --> 00:43:26.539
through the meekness, through the compassion

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:31.877
and the wisdom of Christ.

00:43:32.275 --> 00:43:34.988
Absolutely fearless was He,

00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:38.401
and that's why you have to be fearless

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:43.473
because you have to be only afraid of God and nobody else,

00:43:44.884 --> 00:43:47.300
that's all and if you have done nothing wrong

00:43:47.501 --> 00:43:48.683
there's nothing to be afraid of God also,

00:43:48.884 --> 00:43:52.228
because he loves you very much.

00:43:55.316 --> 00:43:57.459
So be clear cut about everything,

00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:01.213
be understanding,

00:44:03.508 --> 00:44:06.421
you are all loveable people no doubt

00:44:07.063 --> 00:44:11.801
but you should be such that you can adore yourself and love yourself

00:44:12.167 --> 00:44:14.198
because of the virtues you have.

00:44:14.941 --> 00:44:18.981
May God Bless you all.
