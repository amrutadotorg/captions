WEBVTT

00:17.904 --> 00:28.180
Shri Hanuman puja. Pune (India), 31 March 1999.

00:59.420 --> 01:06.311
Today we are celebrating Jayanti (Birth Anniversary) of Hanumanji.

01:10.155 --> 01:17.941
What should we say about Hanumanji!

01:18.326 --> 01:26.143
He was so powerful and wise.

01:28.143 --> 01:33.972
He was equally devoted and dedicated.

01:36.762 --> 01:44.730
Generally such a powerful person becomes right sided.

01:45.159 --> 01:49.309
He considers Himself so dignified that

01:50.087 --> 01:56.589
He doesn't give any importance to anyone in His comparison.

01:58.219 --> 02:08.437
But Hanumanji is a special Deity.

02:09.388 --> 02:16.726
A special deity full of qualities that as much strong He was

02:16.926 --> 02:24.081
as much powerful He was as much was His devotion.

02:24.726 --> 02:27.666
An embodiment of balanced strength

02:27.691 --> 02:32.510
He had as much power, as He had devotion.

02:38.217 --> 02:48.608
How did He maintain this balance?

02:48.861 --> 02:54.317
And was steady in it  is worth understanding.

02:58.426 --> 03:02.766
In Sahaja yoga, when we are enlightened

03:03.153 --> 03:09.707
and in Sahaja yoga we get many powers

03:10.609 --> 03:15.064
simultaneously, we get balance.

03:18.582 --> 03:21.151
We love others.

03:22.998 --> 03:27.735
With love and with the help of the power of Love

03:27.838 --> 03:32.956
we get busy in our work and go on doing our work.

03:33.395 --> 03:37.080
In this way, Shree Hanumanji

03:37.351 --> 03:39.759
was very powerful.

03:39.963 --> 03:42.389
He had Divine powers

03:42.495 --> 03:46.121
He had NAVADHA (Special) powers.

03:46.915 --> 03:49.673
which are called GARIMA, LAGHUMA.

03:49.698 --> 03:52.298
He could become as big as He wanted to be

03:52.323 --> 03:54.637
or as minute as He wanted to be

03:54.725 --> 03:58.799
and as small as an atom.

04:00.026 --> 04:03.430
All these powers

04:04.263 --> 04:06.868
He got through His devotion.

04:07.601 --> 04:10.897
It means that devotion and power

04:10.954 --> 04:13.404
are both the same.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.138
He who has power

04:17.163 --> 04:21.312
and doesn't have devotion, becomes a Rakshasa (Demon).

04:22.235 --> 04:24.734
And He who has devotion

04:24.759 --> 04:28.481
but doesn't have power, becomes mad.

04:30.190 --> 04:34.196
Between both these, he who is in the central path

04:38.883 --> 04:46.948
attains this state which you may call power, or devotion.

04:47.047 --> 04:51.436
Each part of his body is made of that.

04:53.888 --> 05:00.888
Because of His this special feature today we worship Bajrang Bali

05:01.281 --> 05:07.754
in our motherland as well as in foreign countries.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.175
I am so surprised

05:10.370 --> 05:14.250
that the young boys, children of foreign countries,

05:14.401 --> 05:17.119
when they draw any picture

05:17.144 --> 05:21.974
first of all they draw Hanumanji’s picture.

05:23.316 --> 05:25.995
Next, His special quality

05:26.033 --> 05:32.216
was that He was half man and half monkey.

05:34.074 --> 05:41.988
Means, it was a perfect combination of animal and human being.

05:42.576 --> 05:55.923
So within us, whatever we have lost  in our evolution

05:56.593 --> 06:05.719
in that, the element of love and attachment that was what he

06:06.223 --> 06:08.214
took with him.

06:10.448 --> 06:21.442
For example, you see that guru's enamored path is believed

06:21.467 --> 06:30.409
in which of guru's  which creatures are considered as attendants.

06:30.659 --> 06:33.319
That is why they consider dogs.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.296
A dog has that quality

06:36.424 --> 06:44.882
that like a guru's disciple is fully dedicated

06:45.488 --> 06:51.222
and has no other master except his guru

06:52.071 --> 06:56.062
and has no other thought.

06:56.301 --> 07:01.576
Every time,  he sacrifices his life for his master.

07:02.798 --> 07:06.458
In the same way, it should be understood that

07:06.648 --> 07:11.166
a creature who has been brought up in evolution

07:11.191 --> 07:14.262
when he comes in contact with a human being,

07:14.543 --> 07:19.091
what he learns, is full devotion.

07:19.882 --> 07:26.959
It means, devotion is innately born within us.

07:30.190 --> 07:37.891
The seed of devotion is beforehand completely sown within us.

07:38.794 --> 07:44.225
When we were not in this state, not in the human state

07:44.264 --> 07:48.950
the emergence of devotion was more at that time.

07:49.067 --> 07:53.536
Devotion set its roots deeply in us.

07:53.561 --> 07:56.750
Take an example of any animal.

07:57.571 --> 07:59.585
You get a little love from him,

07:59.610 --> 08:02.966
give him a little love, a little fondness for him

08:03.134 --> 08:08.643
he gets so close to you, gives his regard to you

08:09.232 --> 08:13.037
and in this way loves you.

08:13.502 --> 08:16.310
You must have heard about a horse too

08:16.510 --> 08:21.279
that when a horse's rider falls down

08:21.304 --> 08:26.220
or is about to die, he remains loyal to him.

08:33.920 --> 08:40.705
In the same way it is said about elephants.

08:42.416 --> 08:46.435
The elephants' determination too is terrific.

08:46.460 --> 08:53.511
They never put their master to any trouble

08:54.090 --> 09:06.680
and if a lion or any other animal attacks their master

09:06.705 --> 09:09.719
the elephant will better die while going on fighting

09:10.156 --> 09:13.096
but he will not allow his master to be touched.

09:13.354 --> 09:22.646
This relation of a master and superior and high-quality animals

09:24.312 --> 09:29.127
this relation is established within us beforehand.

09:30.596 --> 09:36.493
And along with this relationship we get that power as well.

09:36.731 --> 09:38.316
For example, I told you that

09:38.341 --> 09:41.035
the elephant will die while going on fighting in the battlefield.

09:41.060 --> 09:45.415
The elephant gets this power of fighting too

09:45.440 --> 09:48.842
because of his love and devotion.

09:53.368 --> 10:03.276
We say that Sahaj yoga is the work of love and Divine love is true.

10:03.522 --> 10:09.320
But while doing this work, that power is also inherent in it.

10:12.347 --> 10:16.933
We may or may not know it,

10:18.986 --> 10:23.722
we may or may not have any knowledge of that

10:23.949 --> 10:29.898
but that also is inherent in it, and that is Divine power.

10:32.728 --> 10:37.319
Man's bowing down before anyone

10:37.419 --> 10:42.785
to respect anyone, to consider anyone great

10:42.844 --> 10:46.081
all these are the indications of that.

10:46.423 --> 10:53.321
But when he respects his master, then within him

10:53.543 --> 10:56.443
there is importance to his master

10:56.468 --> 11:01.285
but along with that is his power as well.

11:01.712 --> 11:05.342
So, devotion and power are not two different things.

11:05.391 --> 11:08.058
They are just one and the same.

11:08.083 --> 11:12.426
We will say that if there is power in the right hand

11:12.451 --> 11:14.295
there is devotion in the left hand.

11:15.399 --> 11:18.065
This fusion of power and devotion

11:18.360 --> 11:23.236
has been described beautifully in Shree Hanumanji.

11:25.049 --> 11:28.981
On the one hand He went burn Ravan's Lanka

11:30.412 --> 11:35.742
and there only He prostrated before Sitaji.

11:37.048 --> 11:42.223
And when Sitaji said ''No, you are My son

11:42.319 --> 11:44.438
I will not come at the behest of My son.

11:44.463 --> 11:48.318
My husband will have to come and will have to destroy this man.

11:49.912 --> 11:56.291
When He will destroy him (Ravana), then I will go with Him."

11:56.532 --> 12:00.499
Hanumanji said, “That is okay!"

12:00.524 --> 12:03.263
He could have picked Her up like that only.

12:03.581 --> 12:06.911
He had such powers.

12:07.301 --> 12:15.201
But He said,"If Mother is saying so, it is okay."

12:15.434 --> 12:19.465
And after that, such a great war broke out.

12:19.490 --> 12:22.941
There was a need for that.

12:24.849 --> 12:27.977
Now there were special qualities of Shri Ram.

12:28.002 --> 12:31.330
Extremely powerful!

12:31.949 --> 12:35.754
And His aim would never go astray.

12:36.987 --> 12:41.997
You must have heard what He did in Sita Swayamvar.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.767
But the same Shri Ram

12:44.792 --> 12:50.403
when it was the case of Ravana

12:51.828 --> 12:54.017
He didn't give up.

12:55.762 --> 12:57.884
He killed Him.

12:58.537 --> 13:06.128
Tulsidas ji has given a beautiful description of this scene.

13:06.694 --> 13:12.677
Then Shri Ram was repeatedly hitting the arrows

13:14.914 --> 13:18.297
at Ravana's ten heads.

13:18.456 --> 13:21.036
The heads would fall down one by one but get back again,

13:21.061 --> 13:22.871
fall down and get back again.

13:26.137 --> 13:28.819
Then Laxman said ,"what are You doing?

13:29.185 --> 13:32.012
Shoot one arrow in His heart,

13:32.834 --> 13:35.930
the moment You will hit an arrow in His heart

13:35.955 --> 13:37.605
instantly He will die

13:37.630 --> 13:39.530
Otherwise, how can He die ?

13:39.555 --> 13:41.406
He cannot die."

13:42.492 --> 13:47.025
The arrow should hit His heart.

13:48.276 --> 13:52.231
There is a beautiful description of Shri Ram there.

13:52.653 --> 13:55.241
He was a shy person, very shy.

13:55.415 --> 14:02.579
Shri Ram, even though He was so powerful, so intense

14:04.123 --> 14:06.625
even though He was such a noble person

14:06.650 --> 14:09.846
He said, " You see the problem is that

14:09.871 --> 14:14.818
in Ravan's heart resides My Sita.

14:14.942 --> 14:17.336
So, I won't hit Him in his heart.

14:18.436 --> 14:22.281
But when his head will cut off repeatedly

14:22.306 --> 14:26.620
his attention will surely shift towards his head.

14:26.687 --> 14:30.532
At that time I will kill him with an arrow."

14:30.557 --> 14:32.519
Otherwise for Him, it would be said

14:32.544 --> 14:35.030
that he would kill a person just with one arrow.

14:35.055 --> 14:37.882
But now you see how delicate the matter is.

14:37.907 --> 14:44.411
Simply, it is a husband's love towards his wife.

14:45.615 --> 14:53.083
Even though being an ocean of power, what an amount of love He had!

14:55.153 --> 14:58.688
There are many instances of Hanumanji

14:59.437 --> 15:10.934
in which Hanumanji proved that He is ocean of love

15:11.110 --> 15:16.430
and at the same time, he who is evil minded

15:16.526 --> 15:22.309
he who bothers others, he who destroys others

15:22.756 --> 15:31.169
he doesn't hesitate in any way to kill him.

15:31.969 --> 15:40.069
As all this fact is about Hanuman's devotion

15:40.460 --> 15:45.775
the same is worth noticing about his power of strength.

15:48.545 --> 15:54.078
He knew that Ravana was afraid only of fire.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.506
So, He went to Lanka and set it on fire.

16:00.014 --> 16:06.415
This was His power that He put Lanka on fire.

16:07.295 --> 16:13.341
And in that fire, He didn't kill anyone, He did not burn anyone.

16:13.841 --> 16:16.484
Ravana also did not get burnt,  nobody got burnt

16:16.509 --> 16:19.525
but he got scared.

16:19.550 --> 16:24.331
People got scared, as to what crime Ravana is doing.

16:24.553 --> 16:30.076
People had given full consent about
the type of deeds Ravana was doing.

16:30.282 --> 16:35.947
They would say, "He is Ravana. it is his will.

16:36.295 --> 16:41.319
Whatever he wants to do, let him do. Who are we to question him?

16:41.899 --> 16:43.980
Ravana is after all Ravana."

16:45.445 --> 16:52.396
But it is worth noticing that when Lanka was on fire

16:52.421 --> 16:56.570
when Lanka was completely combusted

16:56.843 --> 17:03.723
people understood that it was a dangerous situation

17:04.698 --> 17:11.671
because Lanka was put on fire and we too could be burnt.

17:12.404 --> 17:16.336
The quality of fire is that it goes upwards, doesn't come downwards.

17:16.615 --> 17:20.024
Everybody was watching upwards that it was burning.

17:20.238 --> 17:25.511
Whole of Lanka was combusted but nobody got burnt.

17:27.928 --> 17:30.646
He did so to frighten them

17:30.671 --> 17:37.421
to make them understand that Ravana is committing a great sin.

17:38.228 --> 17:44.052
How much understanding and how much balanced was Bajrang Bali

17:44.077 --> 17:46.048
should be noted.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.148
The same we come across in History.

17:50.369 --> 17:57.211
All those who were very powerful had immense love.

17:57.932 --> 18:02.852
If you observe an example, there is an example of Shivaji Maharaj.

18:02.953 --> 18:10.098
He was as powerful as He was well behaved,

18:10.203 --> 18:17.038
very disciplined and very well balanced.

18:19.467 --> 18:24.527
When you get this balance, then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

18:25.303 --> 18:29.335
If you get the power, it doesn't mean

18:29.360 --> 18:37.404
that you in your love and your dealings you somehow give up.

18:38.399 --> 18:43.785
But you are powerful and its beauty is that

18:44.120 --> 18:49.919
those who are Schedule caste, poor and unhappy

18:49.944 --> 18:53.817
those who are victims, those who are facing disaster

18:53.842 --> 18:55.376
are secured.........

18:56.598 --> 19:01.010
And those who are troubling them

19:01.095 --> 19:06.482
those who are destroying, those who are bothering

19:06.631 --> 19:09.715
have created  problems for people

19:09.740 --> 19:12.937
to such people

19:13.416 --> 19:14.760
there is no need to do anything.

19:14.785 --> 19:17.066
You can set them right only with the help of bandhans.

19:19.667 --> 19:23.366
The powers that you have received inside your being

19:23.502 --> 19:26.676
it should be used for this very purpose

19:26.917 --> 19:33.415
so that the evil will be destroyed.

19:34.929 --> 19:37.935
But in your power there is no sword

19:38.230 --> 19:41.072
or mace in your hand like Hanumanji.

19:42.252 --> 19:48.043
Mace is not outwardly but it is inside.

19:49.714 --> 19:52.756
You watch your experiences

19:52.986 --> 20:00.082
that he who bothers or disturbs, he is attacked by a mace

20:01.367 --> 20:05.069
you may or may not pick a mace in your hand.

20:05.549 --> 20:09.812
In this way you yourself are safe by default

20:10.036 --> 20:12.601
your safety is  guaranteed

20:12.626 --> 20:29.058
but along with that your other sahaja yogis too are safe.

20:30.198 --> 20:34.997
Now in this Shri Bajrangbali has a great role to play.

20:35.022 --> 20:36.553
You don't know

20:36.578 --> 20:40.382
that he is standing in front of you as well as at your back.

20:45.628 --> 20:49.044
His nature is just like children

20:50.208 --> 20:56.385
Too pure and too simple

20:57.125 --> 21:01.544
but such wisdom

21:03.881 --> 21:07.425
and all types of virtues He knows.

21:08.891 --> 21:13.262
It means that along with His power

21:13.287 --> 21:23.103
He has a lot of absolute discretion- very wise.

21:23.963 --> 21:27.195
The wisdom of the present time is useless

21:27.328 --> 21:28.914
but the wisdom

21:28.939 --> 21:32.887
that will scrutinize and understand everything with love

21:35.431 --> 21:40.980
a special form of that wisdom

21:42.370 --> 21:48.539
was Shri Ganesha and is Shri Hanumana.

21:51.490 --> 21:57.130
The speciality of both of them is that

21:57.155 --> 22:06.547
Hanumanji is very strong, very quick deity

22:06.572 --> 22:11.246
and Shri Ganesha is very cool.

22:11.271 --> 22:20.752
But both are great destructors in times of need.

22:20.888 --> 22:24.519
For Sahaja Yogis there is no need of destruction.

22:24.726 --> 22:27.672
There is no need to destroy anyone.

22:27.839 --> 22:30.373
You just think

22:33.221 --> 22:38.979
that both of them are with you at every moment.

22:39.586 --> 22:43.745
Whenever anyone bothers you

22:44.088 --> 22:50.921
in reality, your protectors are standing with you.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.845
Many times, you must be noticing

22:54.899 --> 23:02.191
that ministers or anyone visits a place, security escorts them.

23:02.525 --> 23:08.167
Sahaja Yogis' security always escorts them.

23:10.535 --> 23:17.112
The other security with them is that of Ganas.

23:21.043 --> 23:24.303
Now their work is too diversified

23:24.328 --> 23:28.171
miscellaneous and little job work also.

23:29.182 --> 23:31.707
And these only

23:31.732 --> 23:38.616
give a message about you to Shri Ganesha who is Ganapati

23:38.642 --> 23:39.641
about what is going on?

23:39.666 --> 23:41.404
What wrong is going on and where?

23:41.429 --> 23:44.559
From where you are being attacked ?

23:44.584 --> 23:48.697
And from where you are troubled?

23:51.016 --> 23:52.672
you may not even be knowing.

23:52.697 --> 23:56.069
Somebody may like to attack you in an unknown form

23:57.093 --> 24:02.479
even then both these deities are standing with you

24:02.504 --> 24:07.961
and when Ganapati tells this

24:08.153 --> 24:11.629
Shri Hanuman gets ready.

24:11.765 --> 24:15.541
Sahaja Yogis need not be afraid of anything.

24:15.739 --> 24:18.383
No need to be afraid of anything

24:18.408 --> 24:20.353
Right now I am going to tell you a Story.

24:20.378 --> 24:22.468
It is so amazing.

24:22.493 --> 24:34.559
You must have heard that America exploded a lot of bombs everywhere

24:35.526 --> 24:43.694
thinking that terrorists have made some arrangements.

24:44.861 --> 24:51.477
The story I am going to tell you is about a place in Africa.

24:51.700 --> 24:56.831
Here were some Sahaja Yogis and a bomb exploded there.

24:58.401 --> 25:03.132
Because of that bomb explosion, all the people died

25:03.157 --> 25:05.090
and Sahaja Yogis remained unhurt.

25:06.611 --> 25:07.643
They were so surprised.

25:07.668 --> 25:10.364
Even the dust did not touch them.

25:11.173 --> 25:15.395
They had never come to Cabella.

25:17.191 --> 25:19.920
They had never thought that they would ever come to Cabella.

25:19.945 --> 25:22.811
But when it took place, they came to Cabella.

25:23.354 --> 25:28.604
And after coming said,''Mother, don't know who saved us

25:29.154 --> 25:31.133
who protected us.''

25:31.502 --> 25:37.722
But all Sahaja Yogis were saved and the rest of the people died...

25:43.818 --> 25:47.844
Now it is an incident, it is true.

25:47.869 --> 25:55.420
And its reason is this that you have now recognized God.

25:55.445 --> 26:06.569
You have enlightened your soul in Sahaja Marga.

26:11.788 --> 26:21.866
With this new transformation

26:21.891 --> 26:33.619
you have become a great devotee and a powerful human being.

26:34.416 --> 26:38.337
Now it is not at all possible for anyone to touch you.

26:38.362 --> 26:42.232
I can give you hundreds of such examples

26:42.519 --> 26:45.627
that when you get your realization in Sahaja

26:47.882 --> 26:51.985
nobody can touch you.

26:53.734 --> 26:55.907
Previously also there were saints.

26:55.971 --> 26:59.495
All of them were tortured, victimized, everything happened.

27:00.049 --> 27:06.845
But in spite of being victimized or tortured, they didn't give up

27:06.870 --> 27:11.252
and not only this, they were always protected.

27:13.034 --> 27:18.464
And they would talk about such things
which would make people very angry.

27:18.495 --> 27:20.853
They would think, what are they talking

27:20.878 --> 27:25.677
against kings, against emperors and against everybody.

27:25.724 --> 27:29.900
They would talk about such things which would scare people

27:29.925 --> 27:34.959
but because of Hanumanji's powers, nobody could touch them.

27:35.711 --> 27:38.073
Nobody hit them.

27:38.327 --> 27:42.107
There is a nice story about Khwaja Nizzamudin Saheb.

27:42.553 --> 27:50.839
That his king told him to bow down before him ..[unclear]..

27:50.864 --> 27:52.200
He didn't bow down.

27:52.225 --> 27:56.231
He said, "No, I am not going to bow down before you. Who are you?''

27:56.940 --> 27:58.630
He was very angry.

27:58.655 --> 28:00.977
He said that if within three days

28:01.002 --> 28:04.206
you do not come and bow down before me

28:04.231 --> 28:06.896
I will get your neck cut off''.

28:06.979 --> 28:08.668
He said,'' Ok, get it cut off!

28:08.693 --> 28:10.128
I won't

28:10.153 --> 28:14.458
because you are not a great saint that i will bow down before you.''

28:16.820 --> 28:23.334
Then he came and raised a great commotion

28:23.359 --> 28:28.099
that after three days this man's neck is to be cut off.

28:28.148 --> 28:31.430
The day his neck was going to be cut off

28:31.455 --> 28:35.629
that night only, this King's neck got cut off, nobody knows how?

28:39.149 --> 28:45.397
If this would not have been in history, those who were great saints

28:45.422 --> 28:51.494
those who were great followers of dharma, would have been no more.

28:52.300 --> 28:58.590
Because Rakshas's ways are so powerful and violent

28:58.981 --> 29:06.620
and are so comprehensive that
they would have surely put an end to them.

29:07.271 --> 29:14.055
But behind them is God.

29:14.516 --> 29:20.717
And God is on one side Hanuman and on another side Ganesha.

29:20.865 --> 29:23.978
He is made of these two powers together.

29:24.762 --> 29:29.311
He is a protector, He takes care.

29:30.598 --> 29:35.655
There is a story of Rana Pratap of Mewar

29:36.468 --> 29:39.363
that when he went to fight a war,

29:40.651 --> 29:46.558
his soldiers thought that he was going to be defeated.

29:46.583 --> 29:47.416
So, they told him

29:47.441 --> 29:48.908
''You return back

29:50.453 --> 29:52.252
because we want that your life should be saved

29:52.277 --> 29:53.576
for the sake of Mewar."

29:53.998 --> 29:55.297
He didn't listen.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.756
He said,"All of you better go back.

29:57.781 --> 30:00.459
I will stay put like this

30:00.484 --> 30:03.475
because the Ganas are standing with me."

30:04.034 --> 30:05.525
He too was a Sahaja Yogi.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.677
"If you want to go, you go.

30:08.702 --> 30:10.665
I will stay here like this, only

30:10.881 --> 30:13.509
because the Ganas are with me."

30:13.932 --> 30:16.748
Just understand that

30:16.840 --> 30:21.427
you have every type of protection in your front and back.

30:29.211 --> 30:32.454
But just on getting this protection

30:33.316 --> 30:37.285
what should a man have? What should a Sahaja Yogi have?

30:37.577 --> 30:43.861
A very serious and determined person, and not afraid of anyone.

30:49.045 --> 30:52.657
He doesn't run away from anyone.

30:53.805 --> 30:57.758
He sticks at that place

30:58.825 --> 31:08.942
and those who are evil persons,in front of him.

31:13.575 --> 31:16.602
He doesn't need to do anything.

31:18.735 --> 31:20.659
That period is over.

31:20.684 --> 31:24.444
Now you just stand at a place and the other person will run away.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.554
He won't come to know what happened.

31:27.547 --> 31:31.972
Sahaja Yogis write and send about many such experiences

31:31.997 --> 31:36.421
that happened like this and that.

31:36.446 --> 31:40.965
Otherwise in the presence of these foreigners

31:40.990 --> 31:44.732
it is not so easy to spread Sahaja Yoga.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.108
And since Sahaja Yoga has started spreading among Muslims too

31:49.133 --> 31:51.460
you can understand that

31:51.485 --> 31:55.089
that this Divine power which is the power of love,

31:55.114 --> 31:57.392
how much strength it has within it

31:59.194 --> 32:02.997
and how many tasks can be done with the help of it.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.605
But it doesn't mean that

32:05.952 --> 32:16.724
you make any harassment in the name of Hanumanji.

32:16.988 --> 32:19.483
It doesn't at all mean that.

32:19.797 --> 32:21.640
For example nowadays, there are such (organizations)

32:21.732 --> 32:24.710
which  take the name of Hanumanji, take the name of Ganesh ji

32:24.782 --> 32:30.835
or of Mahadevji and make such organizations.

32:31.698 --> 32:34.451
There is no need of making any organization.

32:35.044 --> 32:38.240
You yourself are an organization.

32:38.265 --> 32:41.366
Neither anybody can touch you

32:43.844 --> 32:46.807
nor, anyone can destroy you.

32:48.898 --> 32:53.190
First, it is a matter of understanding one's own self

32:53.311 --> 32:55.954
which has been said in all scriptures

32:56.571 --> 33:01.534
that Atmasakhshatkar means to know oneself.

33:01.743 --> 33:04.093
What does it mean to know oneself?

33:05.753 --> 33:12.877
To know means to know who is in front of you and who is behind you.

33:13.587 --> 33:16.308
Who is your protector?

33:16.670 --> 33:22.028
And the love and affection you have for people

33:22.053 --> 33:28.435
and those who always think how to please others

33:28.460 --> 33:31.835
For example (NOT CLEAR)

33:31.860 --> 33:34.371
that i will make the whole world happy.

33:34.396 --> 33:36.805
I will fill everyone's heart with joy.

33:36.830 --> 33:38.983
This thought that comes in your mind

33:39.008 --> 33:45.060
you should understand that there is nobody who can harm you.

33:45.096 --> 33:47.542
Have courage!

33:47.982 --> 33:49.913
Nobody will destroy you.

33:49.938 --> 33:52.600
And for that you don't have to do anything.

33:56.327 --> 34:01.310
For that you don't need to keep any sword

34:01.600 --> 34:03.894
no need to have a mace

34:03.935 --> 34:05.210
They are already there.

34:05.235 --> 34:07.319
They have already come, well prepared.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.389
And they are settled in you.

34:11.335 --> 34:18.940
You don't need to make yourself strong. You are already so.

34:22.277 --> 34:26.990
There is a Chinese story, very interesting!

34:27.165 --> 34:31.324
In their country, cock fights are organized.

34:33.099 --> 34:36.872
When the cock fight was on, it so happened that

34:37.919 --> 34:43.847
somehow a king felt that he should go to a saint.

34:45.042 --> 34:52.081
Let the cocks learn from the saint, how to fight with the world.

34:52.608 --> 34:54.698
Because, this saint does not fight with anyone

34:54.723 --> 34:56.288
nor anyone touches him.

34:56.769 --> 34:58.709
People run away from him

34:58.734 --> 35:01.522
and salute him.

35:01.547 --> 35:05.479
So what is so special about him

35:05.614 --> 35:11.631
that he is living in this wicked world like this.

35:12.475 --> 35:16.476
The saint told him,''Ok! leave the cock here.''

35:17.219 --> 35:20.857
So, he went back, leaving one cock with him.

35:20.882 --> 35:23.861
He took back that cock after one month

35:24.246 --> 35:28.897
and put him where the cock fight was going on.

35:28.922 --> 35:31.025
There were a lot of cocks.

35:31.609 --> 35:34.603
He put him in such a courtyard.

35:35.113 --> 35:41.533
But this great cock kept standing.

35:42.310 --> 35:46.097
Now all the cocks were fighting among themselves.

35:46.122 --> 35:48.496
One after the other they left.

35:51.052 --> 35:53.335
Only this one cock kept standing.

35:55.143 --> 35:57.722
Everybody started getting scared of him
and he is not reacting at all.

35:57.747 --> 36:00.009
Is he somewhat special?

36:01.661 --> 36:06.612
And at the end that one cock was saved who kept standing gracefully.

36:08.828 --> 36:11.749
So when we are doing the puja of Hanuman Ji here today

36:11.774 --> 36:16.717
we must think that Hanumanji has settled in reality within us.

36:18.511 --> 36:21.158
He is on our right side.

36:28.184 --> 36:30.593
That means He is working on our Pingala Nadi.

36:31.960 --> 36:38.110
He works on our Pingala Nadi and creates enthusiasm in us

36:39.584 --> 36:43.793
and that creates warmath in our body.

36:44.687 --> 36:46.657
But his path is such that

36:46.765 --> 36:50.680
along with warmath you feel devotion within you.

36:53.807 --> 36:56.863
So, the warmath that comes, the enthusiasm it creates

37:00.810 --> 37:04.581
that works inside us on our right side

37:05.085 --> 37:10.522
and when we do not absorb the balanced power of Hanumanji

37:10.547 --> 37:14.592
we get a lot of diseases.

37:14.764 --> 37:31.029
For example the liver problem, asthma

37:32.638 --> 37:35.299
and when its heat goes downwards

37:35.324 --> 37:38.206
Hanumanji controls this heat.

37:38.231 --> 37:43.615
But when the heat doesn't get controlled, such diseases attack

37:43.640 --> 37:45.873
which are incurable.

37:45.898 --> 37:48.271
It can cause blood cancer

37:48.296 --> 37:50.336
and there can be intestinal trouble

37:50.361 --> 37:52.608
which means all the troubles all over the world are

37:52.633 --> 37:55.317
caused just by the breakdown of the liver

37:55.342 --> 38:02.505
and the liver gets spoiled because we do not follow Hanumanji.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.595
There is no need to get angry.

38:08.245 --> 38:11.319
But getting angry and start hitting,

38:11.851 --> 38:17.261
beating this and that person to create panic,

38:17.554 --> 38:20.365
this is not Hanumanji's power.

38:22.296 --> 38:25.524
There is no question of getting angry.

38:27.993 --> 38:32.215
There is no question of getting angry about anyone.

38:32.240 --> 38:38.097
There is no need at all, if you respect Hanumanji.

38:38.258 --> 38:40.659
He is not angry with anyone

38:43.449 --> 38:47.327
But a human being gets angry over everything.

38:48.012 --> 38:50.382
He gets ego.

38:51.302 --> 38:53.343
Hanumanji didn't have ego at all.

38:53.368 --> 38:56.615
A right sided person is very egoistic.

38:57.795 --> 39:01.482
A human being has so much ego!

39:01.507 --> 39:05.435
I become restless when I see what they were egotistical.

39:06.673 --> 39:10.384
That ego doesn't have any meaning

39:10.409 --> 39:11.700
What does "I" mean?

39:13.863 --> 39:19.521
Even an ordinary human being becomes egoistic.

39:19.657 --> 39:23.074
And many Kings and emperors also are not egoistic.

39:24.010 --> 39:29.135
Its reason is that inside their being there is such a conditioning

39:29.256 --> 39:31.831
that they do not recognize Hanumanji.

39:33.097 --> 39:38.371
As soon as you recognize Hanuman Ji, you recognise Shri Ram.

39:40.691 --> 39:46.353
Now tell Me if you are right sided, you should not get Asthma

39:46.378 --> 39:48.214
because Shree Ram is settled

39:48.239 --> 39:50.973
according to Sahaja Yoga in our right heart.

39:53.109 --> 39:55.955
Because you do not recognize Hanumanji

39:56.091 --> 40:00.955
your behaviour and your balance is not like His

40:00.980 --> 40:04.344
that is why you get Asthma as well.

40:06.676 --> 40:14.483
Shivji's place is in your heart,  there also is the same fuss

40:14.690 --> 40:19.979
and you can get a heart attack or you can have some other diseases.

40:22.354 --> 40:27.002
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you should understand that

40:27.027 --> 40:30.432
Hanumanji is an ideal in front of you.

40:30.747 --> 40:36.522
Ganeshji is already there, He is the incarnation of innocence

40:37.136 --> 40:41.542
just like small children, very innocent

40:41.610 --> 40:44.571
but very wise.

40:45.295 --> 40:49.255
And a perfect balance of Hanumanji’s

40:49.482 --> 40:52.516
happiness full of love

40:53.146 --> 40:56.380
and along with that experience Divine power.

40:58.906 --> 41:01.359
Keeping this in mind

41:01.384 --> 41:04.366
a Sahaja Yogi's character or life should be such

41:04.391 --> 41:07.699
that he should be balanced.

41:07.724 --> 41:14.393
Even when you are angry, just observe silence.

41:17.317 --> 41:20.046
I feel, I never get angry.

41:20.071 --> 41:24.303
Or maybe I get angry, but I am not aware of it.

41:26.093 --> 41:29.485
And the problem gets solved without getting angry.

41:29.510 --> 41:32.522
Yes, I may say,"what are you doing?"

41:32.547 --> 41:35.780
Not much beyond this.

41:36.271 --> 41:40.944
People abuse and use all bad words

41:41.056 --> 41:43.391
But when it crosses its limits

41:45.159 --> 41:49.265
and when this habit of getting angry crosses its limits and man.....

41:49.290 --> 41:51.521
He is sitting angrily

41:51.546 --> 41:53.167
sitting there in a very angry mood.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.068
He is showing his anger.

41:55.093 --> 42:00.565
When people are like that, a serious problem arises

42:00.590 --> 42:06.016
they get a serious disease called Alzheimer.

42:06.420 --> 42:09.916
Alzheimer is caused by anger.

42:12.787 --> 42:16.893
That anger which we get unnecessarily.

42:17.554 --> 42:21.063
Now try to understand, Your son has been slapped by somebody.

42:21.088 --> 42:23.200
And you get angry.

42:24.373 --> 42:26.889
Nothing is gained by getting angry.

42:26.914 --> 42:30.680
On the contrary you should think, if it is the mistake of our son?

42:30.705 --> 42:35.178
Or we are spoiling that boy unnecessarily
under the cover of our love.

42:39.264 --> 42:42.712
He will never have a balance in this way.

42:42.737 --> 42:46.200
Alzheimer is a very serious disease.

42:46.225 --> 42:48.345
A person gets mad,

42:48.409 --> 42:51.701
doesn't even die, nor allows anyone to die,

42:53.849 --> 42:57.327
abuses, goes on shouting.

42:57.352 --> 43:01.680
He gets so much caught up in his left side, in his brain

43:01.729 --> 43:04.799
that his personality becomes very strange.

43:07.708 --> 43:10.101
It's treatment is in Sahaja Yoga

43:10.126 --> 43:11.726
but it is very difficult,

43:11.751 --> 43:14.159
because they go on abusing.

43:14.184 --> 43:17.173
If they will abuse the person who will go to set them right,

43:17.198 --> 43:20.142
who will accept it. If anyone is a doctor.

43:20.167 --> 43:22.625
if he is abused, he will say let him go to hell.

43:22.650 --> 43:24.526
What have I to do with him?

43:24.838 --> 43:27.582
This is what happens with them, they don't want to.

43:27.892 --> 43:30.828
Mother we won't set them right, let them go.

43:31.795 --> 43:34.322
Whichever way they want to live, let them live.

43:34.347 --> 43:41.449
Now the next greatest enemies of Hanumanji are drunkards.

43:43.326 --> 43:48.851
Those who drink, are put to flames like Lanka.

43:52.133 --> 43:55.260
Say, you see those who drink

43:55.448 --> 43:58.161
nobody will talk to them nor do anything else.

43:58.186 --> 44:01.325
He will collect ten more drunkards and drink.

44:02.380 --> 44:04.518
And now when all of them are drinking

44:04.543 --> 44:08.720
they don't have anything to eat nor to drink at their homes.

44:08.745 --> 44:13.274
They are drinking just like mad people.

44:14.651 --> 44:18.473
Those who respect Hanumanji, can't drink,

44:19.097 --> 44:20.097
can't drink because,

44:21.873 --> 44:23.811
on the one hand, you respect Him

44:23.836 --> 44:25.733
and on the other hand do the opposite, that is not possible.

44:27.194 --> 44:30.761
Nowadays I find that drinking is on the rise.

44:38.586 --> 44:41.335
And I am so surprised , there was a senior officer

44:41.546 --> 44:44.769
once we went to his house,

44:45.244 --> 44:48.478
because both of them were friends of My Husband.

44:48.645 --> 44:51.128
And both husband and wife would drink.

44:51.806 --> 44:53.707
It was very cold.

44:53.732 --> 44:55.894
They told Me,"Stay here for the night."

44:55.919 --> 44:57.820
I said,"Ok, we will stay."

44:57.845 --> 44:59.976
In the whole house, there was just one blanket.

45:00.001 --> 45:01.613
I said,"Oh! My God!"

45:01.724 --> 45:04.646
Just one blanket in the home of such a senior officer.

45:04.671 --> 45:06.806
I said," It doesn't matter to Me, I will sleep."

45:06.831 --> 45:10.275
Now they were worried, how to manage for My husband in one blanket.

45:11.269 --> 45:14.235
I said," Don't worry. I will set it right."

45:14.260 --> 45:17.944
They had such a great problem about themselves and their daughter

45:17.969 --> 45:19.487
but they were not willing to agree

45:19.512 --> 45:22.184
that their daughter had any problem.

45:22.216 --> 45:23.944
As soon as they drink

45:23.969 --> 45:25.480
they will start saying

45:25.505 --> 45:28.512
our daughter is best of all, don't say anything.

45:28.559 --> 45:31.166
That girl was in complete devastation,

45:31.210 --> 45:32.873
because they were under the influence of intoxication.

45:32.898 --> 45:34.962
When intoxicated they were not are not in senses.

45:36.613 --> 45:40.331
That girl was completely devastated.

45:40.356 --> 45:42.999
At last she came to Me just now, crying.

45:43.248 --> 45:45.794
She has been totally devastated.

45:47.149 --> 45:50.671
So it is like this that intoxication on account of drinking

45:51.005 --> 45:54.803
increases intoxication all the more

45:55.964 --> 45:59.174
and in that the most intoxicating thing is that

45:59.317 --> 46:02.489
a man is devoid of love.

46:02.648 --> 46:04.483
He doesn't love anyone.

46:04.675 --> 46:10.646
That is why everyone, in every religion, prohibited drinking.

46:12.385 --> 46:14.500
But for example, as is the case with the Christian religion

46:14.636 --> 46:17.453
everybody manages somehow.

46:17.478 --> 46:18.416
They say it is so in Hindu dharam,

46:18.441 --> 46:21.142
in Christians and in Mohammedans too.

46:21.167 --> 46:24.089
So they said that when

46:24.865 --> 46:29.232
Christ had gone to attend a marriage,

46:29.257 --> 46:31.908
in that marriage liquor was made.

46:31.933 --> 46:34.122
Absolutely false!

46:35.539 --> 46:37.284
That is why we drink.

46:37.309 --> 46:41.307
I was surprised in England that if anyone dies, they drink

46:41.332 --> 46:43.627
if anyone dies, even then they drink.

46:43.652 --> 46:45.994
If anyone is born, even then they drink.

46:46.019 --> 46:48.391
What does it mean, I can't understand.

46:49.483 --> 46:51.751
The habit that they have got used to

46:51.776 --> 46:55.637
and drink has become like culture.

46:55.662 --> 46:57.460
They have to write books about drinks

46:57.485 --> 46:59.902
which should be drunk when

46:59.927 --> 47:00.968
not this,that

47:00.993 --> 47:04.201
and  which type of glass should be used.

47:05.496 --> 47:09.920
Now the condition of these drunkards that I have seen

47:09.945 --> 47:14.387
I think they are half human beings and half absolutely mad.

47:15.409 --> 47:16.724
They are mad!

47:17.502 --> 47:19.747
But it is getting sanctified there.

47:19.772 --> 47:21.821
It is topmost in France.

47:21.846 --> 47:23.687
It became the culture of France.

47:23.712 --> 47:26.534
We don't have to learn anything from them.

47:26.559 --> 47:29.313
Now what they talk about drinks;

47:29.433 --> 47:35.200
Christ, when He went there that time,  that place

47:35.225 --> 47:37.702
I have read this in HEBRU

47:37.933 --> 47:40.792
that the people

47:41.475 --> 47:44.746
used to drink the juice of DRAKSHA

47:44.873 --> 47:47.734
means, they used to take grape juice.

47:47.891 --> 47:54.481
So He put His hand in water and made juice of grapes out of water.

47:54.625 --> 47:59.025
Does that juice ever become a drink without rotting and softening?

48:00.320 --> 48:04.278
Can a drink ever be made in two minutes in Sahaj?

48:04.397 --> 48:06.631
Till you do not rot the drink a lot

48:06.656 --> 48:10.385
and the more it is rotten, the more it is costlier.

48:10.909 --> 48:14.402
If it has been rotten for the past fifty years
it is all the more better.

48:14.427 --> 48:18.445
And if it is a hundred year old, it is rare.

48:18.857 --> 48:22.107
These notions about drinks were created by drunkards,

48:22.132 --> 48:25.009
the drunkard writers and the drunkard tellers.

48:26.778 --> 48:29.051
With the lectures of the drunkards

48:29.076 --> 48:32.058
don't know how many people become fools.

48:32.083 --> 48:37.234
But I have not seen any effigy erected of
any drunkard in any country.

48:39.505 --> 48:47.042
So all these people

48:48.267 --> 48:52.828
are not only against Shri Hanuman,

48:52.900 --> 48:56.047
but they attack Him.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.225
Then He also shows His power,

48:58.250 --> 49:01.220
causing such heat in his stomach.

49:01.245 --> 49:05.443
It then causes Cancer and all the diseases.

49:05.468 --> 49:07.065
Drink more and more!

49:14.028 --> 49:16.654
This drinking and serving drinks to others

49:16.679 --> 49:20.164
is the custom of drinking that has started.

49:21.150 --> 49:22.952
I am scared of this.

49:22.977 --> 49:24.845
Manage Hanumanji

49:24.870 --> 49:26.853
Don't know what He will do.

49:27.777 --> 49:30.124
What disaster He may cause

49:30.149 --> 49:32.384
is unpredictable.

49:33.211 --> 49:38.057
I am afraid that one day He may put all the drunkards in the sea,

49:39.040 --> 49:44.542
because  He has mercy, devotion and everything

49:44.567 --> 49:47.282
but those who are against Him

49:47.307 --> 49:49.079
he is not for them.

49:49.358 --> 49:51.484
For example Shri Ganesha

49:51.509 --> 49:55.433
if anyone has a bad character

49:55.647 --> 49:58.848
if any one acts badly

49:58.895 --> 50:04.486
is attacked on his Mooladhara Chakra.

50:04.734 --> 50:07.850
But His case is different.

50:08.096 --> 50:14.631
When He sees that he is playing with his own consciousness

50:14.731 --> 50:23.242
by drinking- consciousness is lost- then He chases him.

50:23.747 --> 50:28.169
There will be conflict, quarrels and fights in homes

50:28.194 --> 50:31.023
and you see there will be fights on roads if you..

50:31.078 --> 50:32.796
NOT CLEAR..

50:32.821 --> 50:36.784
two drunkards will be hitting each other

50:38.418 --> 50:41.350
and then it spreads all the more.

50:41.375 --> 50:45.827
So Sahaja Yogis should not visit any drunkard's house

50:46.206 --> 50:48.679
that is an unholy place

50:48.704 --> 50:55.742
nor should keep any association with any drunkard.

50:57.929 --> 51:00.338
This is also fatal for Sahaja Yogis

51:00.363 --> 51:02.933
because on one hand you respect Hanumanji

51:02.958 --> 51:05.160
and on the other hand join drunkards.

51:10.380 --> 51:24.399
Especially in Poona, I don't know
how many types of Hanumanjis have come  here,

51:24.424 --> 51:29.578
people living in Poona should be very alert.

51:33.982 --> 51:37.148
Once a Hanumanji group had come
and requested Me to deliver a lecture.

51:37.173 --> 51:38.450
I said ,"I won't come".

51:38.475 --> 51:39.862
They asked, “Why Mother?"

51:40.632 --> 51:45.134
I told them that after having a drink you sing silly movie songs.

51:45.159 --> 51:48.941
Do you know who is this Maruti?

51:48.966 --> 51:51.167
When He will strangle throats of all of you

51:51.192 --> 51:53.059
then only you will come to know.

51:53.084 --> 51:59.966
I have heard about Ganpati programs
that  they don't allow anyone to drink.

52:00.273 --> 52:02.752
They drive away those who drink.

52:02.777 --> 52:04.303
Just think,

52:04.328 --> 52:06.682
see their courage!

52:06.707 --> 52:10.685
In front of Hanumanji, they do all this business

52:10.710 --> 52:14.102
In front of Hanumanji!

52:15.153 --> 52:17.589
What a courage!

52:19.216 --> 52:21.086
and this

52:21.504 --> 52:23.324
by doing everything

52:24.426 --> 52:27.281
people think that they get money.

52:28.508 --> 52:31.262
Those who deal in it

52:31.750 --> 52:35.901
and those who drink, are its customers

52:36.401 --> 52:41.403
everybody somehow absolutely

52:42.992 --> 52:48.730
useless, bankrupt , don't have a single penny

52:53.197 --> 52:56.020
We will say, what is there so much in drinking

52:56.045 --> 52:59.755
because it is Shri Hanumanji's case.

53:00.159 --> 53:04.405
What is the reason you are going against Hanumanji?

53:04.740 --> 53:08.713
His power flows through your right side.

53:08.738 --> 53:11.985
Use that in balance.

53:12.010 --> 53:16.395
instead of upsetting your liver, spoil this and spoil that.

53:16.411 --> 53:17.949
He will definitely get upset.

53:18.551 --> 53:21.795
That means it is Hanumanji's job in subtle.

53:23.414 --> 53:27.014
People don't understand this in reality.

53:27.212 --> 53:29.191
In reality it is such

53:29.216 --> 53:31.310
that if you say something against drinking

53:31.335 --> 53:34.285
people will run to kill you.

53:35.039 --> 53:36.006
If you don't drink

53:36.031 --> 53:38.627
they will say you are a fool that you don't drink.

53:41.331 --> 53:50.608
Oh!  behind him is standing such great Hanumanji.

53:51.771 --> 53:53.589
If you attack him even once

53:53.614 --> 53:55.896
you will be no more,  you will lose your life.

53:55.921 --> 53:58.096
I think that if people start striking beforehand.....

53:58.135 --> 54:00.808
How do people talk such nonsense?

54:04.171 --> 54:06.854
They will repeat the same thing again and again.

54:09.021 --> 54:10.883
They are almost absolutely mad

54:10.908 --> 54:16.106
they are all together, have a party and they are all mad.

54:19.773 --> 54:24.670
It may be marriage or marriage procession,
everywhere it is prevalent.

54:26.351 --> 54:33.512
Now the person who works

54:33.537 --> 54:38.231
one who thinks of the future, one who is thoughtful

54:38.256 --> 54:41.948
but is devoid of love towards everyone

54:42.036 --> 54:45.686
has no feeling of love, he is also in trouble.

54:46.298 --> 54:52.208
Because  the devotee of Rama

54:52.873 --> 54:57.411
there is no whereabouts of Hanumanji.

55:01.134 --> 55:06.152
If you are a great worker

55:06.379 --> 55:08.385
you are a well to do person, a nice person

55:08.422 --> 55:11.260
but you don't have love for anyone

55:13.243 --> 55:15.687
it won't work.

55:16.813 --> 55:20.446
You have to love everyone

55:21.299 --> 55:23.062
and that is why

55:23.217 --> 55:28.092
Christ has said ,"Forgive everyone."

55:28.283 --> 55:32.446
Who are you not to forgive?

55:33.031 --> 55:35.301
You yourself are not Hanumanji.

55:35.562 --> 55:40.133
Yes, Hanumanji is with you and He is an ideal for you

55:40.636 --> 55:49.124
that He on the basis of His devotion
has attained this high position.

55:51.227 --> 55:56.156
Wherever there is heat, people's brains get upset

55:57.116 --> 56:00.384
and the bond of love gets disrupted.

56:02.736 --> 56:09.622
Every body should salute such Hanuman devotee, Shri Bajrangbali

56:12.396 --> 56:18.363
and should understand that whatever powers
we have got from Sahaja Yoga

56:18.388 --> 56:21.090
we should keep in balance.

56:24.489 --> 56:26.712
Love is such a thing

56:26.737 --> 56:34.380
that you can win over great personalities with the bond of love.

56:37.451 --> 56:40.188
I go on doing the same

56:40.213 --> 56:43.375
because I have to face strange people.

56:44.072 --> 56:49.418
Now handle them with such a trick of love that they will be ok.

56:50.221 --> 56:52.379
Once I went somewhere.

56:52.418 --> 56:56.634
There was a famous but very short tempered saint;

56:56.659 --> 56:59.660
All of them are very short tempered.

56:59.962 --> 57:01.734
Then I climbed up and went there.

57:02.662 --> 57:06.968
He was shaking his neck in anger.

57:07.167 --> 57:15.186
Because he was egoistic that he could control rain.

57:15.685 --> 57:19.590
And as I climbed up and reached

57:19.741 --> 57:22.552
I was drenched completely wet in rain.

57:23.625 --> 57:26.983
Now, he was sitting in great anger.

57:27.423 --> 57:29.831
I sat in his cave.

57:29.856 --> 57:31.820
He came and sat

57:31.845 --> 57:33.817
He was very angry.

57:33.842 --> 57:37.266
I asked,"What happened, even if I got wet?"

57:37.291 --> 57:46.068
He said, "You did not stop the rain to take away my ego.

57:46.093 --> 57:47.939
Because I can stop it.

57:47.964 --> 57:50.025
I had this ego."

57:50.050 --> 57:51.971
"There is nothing like that."

57:52.142 --> 57:57.273
I said,"You are a Saint and you have purchased a saree for Me.

57:57.740 --> 58:03.951
I cannot take anything from a saint.

58:04.182 --> 58:07.019
And you cannot give Me anything.

58:07.336 --> 58:11.592
Then I thought it is better to get wet
nd I will have to accept it."

58:13.447 --> 58:15.045
Because of that

58:15.070 --> 58:19.524
tears came out of his eyes and he fell down at My feet.

58:20.262 --> 58:23.681
I said, ‘what should I have done?
I had to just get wet.

58:23.706 --> 58:26.989
Otherwise I too would not have accepted it.

58:27.014 --> 58:28.903
I said that it is better to get a little wet

58:28.928 --> 58:30.539
then I will have to accept it’.

58:31.859 --> 58:34.099
Then he said, "Is it so?"

58:34.124 --> 58:38.708
I said you have purchased a peach coloured saree for Me

58:38.733 --> 58:41.520
and nauvar (nine yards) this you have done a good thing

58:41.545 --> 58:46.625
because My petticoat too has got wet, so I can wear this nauvar.

58:47.765 --> 58:50.001
He was very happy.

58:50.026 --> 58:53.404
So, love is such a thing

58:53.579 --> 58:58.427
that it brings down to earth even great people fuming with anger.

59:00.033 --> 59:05.459
There are so many earlier examples of it.

59:05.484 --> 59:10.507
When they say," Basu"(Sit down),
the whole night will pass like that.

59:11.093 --> 59:14.025
And even now everyday it happens so.

59:14.050 --> 59:16.357
Talk with love.

59:17.253 --> 59:19.098
How does it matter?

59:19.123 --> 59:24.410
If you love others, their good qualities will transmit to you

59:24.699 --> 59:34.258
and if you hate someone, their bad qualities will transmit to you.

59:34.798 --> 59:37.261
It is all give and take.

59:37.494 --> 59:41.220
This person is like this, that person is like that

59:41.245 --> 59:43.334
whosoever you see is not right.

59:44.935 --> 59:47.532
It is a custom with so many people

59:47.557 --> 59:49.028
It is their culture

59:49.176 --> 59:50.360
that if someone comes to his home

59:50.385 --> 59:53.355
stays, has his meals and fun and everything is over.

59:53.380 --> 59:57.300
As soon as he leaves, comments follow that he is such a bad man.

59:57.325 --> 59:58.827
Next came and sat down

59:58.866 --> 01:00:00.430
especially among women it is too much prevalent.

01:00:01.236 --> 01:00:02.956
He comes and sits.

01:00:02.981 --> 01:00:05.105
You are very nice, very nice and now you can go.

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:06.944
Yes he is like that!

01:00:07.928 --> 01:00:12.259
Oh! this outward love won't work.

01:00:12.432 --> 01:00:18.316
If you shower artificial love, does he not understand?

01:00:18.922 --> 01:00:24.740
You have got the power to love by heart as you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:00:27.562 --> 01:00:33.177
And when you will imbibe this

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:39.634
when the tree of love will bloom by itself

01:00:39.861 --> 01:00:45.231
you will give joy to others and you too will enjoy its fragrance.

01:00:46.254 --> 01:00:50.780
Except the ocean of love, you will not like anything.

01:00:53.795 --> 01:00:57.427
So, what you have to learn from Bajrangbali is

01:00:57.452 --> 01:01:03.874
His devotion and that power which He has given to you

01:01:03.899 --> 01:01:08.961
that nobody can touch you if your devotion is pure.

01:01:09.407 --> 01:01:11.402
Nobody can touch you.

01:01:11.427 --> 01:01:14.499
There are thousands of such examples in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:14.524 --> 01:01:16.564
People call these miracles

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:21.076
but I say that it is Shri Hanumanji's blessing.

01:01:24.435 --> 01:01:31.222
So, now I give My blessings and love to all of you.

01:01:33.045 --> 01:01:37.321
First love yourself and then others.

01:01:37.346 --> 01:01:39.545
It doesn't mean my son, my this

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.302
No! No! No!

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.179
It means selfless love.

01:01:46.204 --> 01:01:48.721
Love that expects no return,

01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:53.518
Which has no relation, is limitless.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:02:00.160
Such a power of love has come to you, use it.

01:02:01.391 --> 01:02:03.692
Lots of blessings!

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.090
Anant Aashirvad (Limitless blessings).
