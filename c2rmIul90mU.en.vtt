00:02.917 --> 00:08.417
Sahaja Marriage and Gruha Lakshmi Puja

00:13.959 --> 00:20.917
April 7th, 1981, Sydney, Australia

00:28.250 --> 00:32.959
Today is the anniversary day of the wedding,

00:36.999 --> 00:40.542
and I have allowed them to celebrate it

00:41.208 --> 00:44.542
because marriage is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:45.041 --> 00:48.166
It is one of the most important things for Sahaja Yoga,

00:48.875 --> 00:51.542
that one should get married.

00:51.542 --> 00:54.041
Firstly, marriage always gives you

00:54.625 --> 00:57.375
a balance of understanding,

00:57.709 --> 00:59.625
if you have proper ideas about marriage.

00:59.917 --> 01:04.375
If you have funny ideas, and if you are just marrying

01:04.625 --> 01:07.875
for fun’s sake, and you do not understand

01:08.083 --> 01:12.291
the value of marriage, then it is just a joke,

01:12.667 --> 01:14.500
it’s not a marriage.

01:14.750 --> 01:17.208
But in Sahaja Yoga you really understand

01:17.542 --> 01:21.000
the value of marriage first of all, what it means.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.583
And then, luckily today we are going to have

01:24.834 --> 01:27.709
some Sahaja Yoga weddings, in which you will see

01:27.959 --> 01:35.041
how we try to conform to the divine laws of marriage,

01:35.375 --> 01:38.166
and get married under those laws.

01:42.750 --> 01:47.208
Here I find in Australia as well as in other countries

01:47.542 --> 01:49.999
that marriage has lost its sanctity.

01:50.333 --> 01:52.709
People don’t understand that by doing sin

01:53.000 --> 01:55.667
against the marriage, they are committing such

01:55.917 --> 02:00.375
great sins that many generations will have to suffer

02:00.375 --> 02:02.500
for this kind of a thing.

02:02.792 --> 02:04.959
One has to understand that fidelity

02:05.250 --> 02:09.125
is the basis of marriage.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.542
If there is no fidelity marriage has no meaning.

02:12.834 --> 02:16.083
If you are not capable of being “fidel”(faithful),

02:16.375 --> 02:18.667
that means you are not yet a human being.

02:18.999 --> 02:22.542
A human being has to be a “fidelite”.

02:22.875 --> 02:27.792
In marriage we confirm that the problem is over now,

02:28.125 --> 02:31.333
we have finished with the choices we had,

02:31.667 --> 02:35.208
and now we are going to settle down with one person.

02:35.542 --> 02:39.709
And the sharing of life, in even absolutely

02:40.000 --> 02:43.458
private life, is with one person.

02:43.792 --> 02:47.041
So you have to be very much harmonized

02:47.375 --> 02:53.500
with that person, and in complete understanding

02:53.875 --> 02:58.875
and loyalties with each other, one has to develop.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.959
Now the marriage is for the reproduction

03:04.250 --> 03:07.458
of the species, as they say.

03:07.709 --> 03:12.750
Now as you are another species, you are Sahaja yogis -

03:12.999 --> 03:16.375
it’s a new awareness – marriages between you

03:16.375 --> 03:21.166
will bring forth children of very high caliber.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.625
There are great saints who are anxious

03:23.875 --> 03:27.542
to get birth on this Earth,

03:27.792 --> 03:32.999
and if they find good Sahaja yogi husband and wife

03:32.999 --> 03:34.834
who love each other,

03:34.834 --> 03:38.959
are good progressive people in Sahaja Yoga,

03:39.250 --> 03:42.166
who are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga,

03:42.625 --> 03:45.250
they would be definitely descending

03:45.250 --> 03:48.166
on this Earth through you.

03:48.583 --> 03:52.542
So it is very important and imminent at this time

03:52.834 --> 03:56.208
that one should understand the value,

03:56.208 --> 04:01.792
the value of the marriage of Sahaja Yoga.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.166
So many marriages have taken place before also,

04:06.625 --> 04:09.625
but what is the validity or what is the credibility

04:09.875 --> 04:13.375
of those marriages, when the person who marries them

04:13.625 --> 04:16.417
in the name of God is not a realized soul?

04:16.417 --> 04:19.625
He has to be a realized soul to marry them.

04:19.917 --> 04:22.291
He has no authority to marry in the name of God.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.583
All right, registration is a different thing altogether

04:24.917 --> 04:27.208
because they do not marry in the name of God,

04:27.583 --> 04:29.834
they marry in the name of a nation.

04:30.208 --> 04:32.000
But if you have to marry in the name of God,

04:32.250 --> 04:34.667
you must have a realized soul to do that.

04:34.959 --> 04:37.500
And one should understand every bit of the marriage

04:37.792 --> 04:40.709
that is performed, what you are doing,

04:40.959 --> 04:42.291
why you are doing.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.250
There are certain promises that are to be given.

04:45.625 --> 04:48.041
We have taken this marriage system

04:48.375 --> 04:51.166
from the old wedding system, also changed it

04:51.417 --> 04:53.792
very much according to the Sahaja Yoga,

04:54.041 --> 04:56.500
where we have been trying to use all,

04:56.875 --> 04:59.041
also certain ceremonies which are done

04:59.417 --> 05:02.333
in the churches and other religions,

05:02.750 --> 05:06.125
but mainly it is based on the Kundalini.

05:07.583 --> 05:11.834
So the promise is to the fire, in this marriage,

05:12.542 --> 05:16.583
promise is to the fire; because fire is the one

05:16.917 --> 05:20.333
that burns up all that is ugly.

05:20.583 --> 05:25.083
And Kundalini is also like a fire on one point,

05:25.083 --> 05:29.208
because that’s the only energy that rises above.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.709
See, so like the fire goes upward,

05:31.959 --> 05:34.458
the Kundalini also rises upward.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.834
That’s why it is compared to the fire.

05:36.834 --> 05:39.999
But fire is the energy which is in the stomach,

05:39.999 --> 05:42.875
which is the dharma, which is the religion.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.875
And the religion of the Sahaja yogis

05:45.208 --> 05:47.999
is to keep in the center, not to go to extremes.

05:48.291 --> 05:53.458
And when they get married, by their understanding

05:53.750 --> 05:56.792
of Sahaja Yoga they pull each other

05:57.000 --> 05:59.999
towards the center much more, and enjoy themselves –

06:00.208 --> 06:04.000
the present, the present moment, and the present as it is.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.500
Sahaja Yoga marriages can be really fantastic

06:07.500 --> 06:10.458
if the Sahaja yogis who marry are sensible,

06:10.458 --> 06:13.500
are equally balanced,

06:13.500 --> 06:16.250
or are not criticizing each other,

06:16.500 --> 06:18.834
not taking an upper hand.

06:19.041 --> 06:22.500
It is possible for one Sahaja yogi to marry another one,

06:22.875 --> 06:26.792
to gradually upgrade that Sahaja yogi.

06:27.083 --> 06:30.875
It is possible also to degrade if a,

06:30.875 --> 06:34.792
another Sahaja yogi is more powerful or negative so much

06:35.000 --> 06:38.250
that it can degrade also another person.

06:38.250 --> 06:42.917
It depends on your quality to be upgraded or degraded.

06:43.125 --> 06:46.500
So marriage is a very big blessing in Sahaja Yoga,

06:46.792 --> 06:51.750
because all the, all the gods and all the angels

06:51.750 --> 06:53.625
are watching these marriages,

06:53.875 --> 06:55.542
and they will see to it

06:55.875 --> 06:58.041
that these marriages are successful.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.417
But if you are bent upon making them unsuccessful

07:00.417 --> 07:03.875
because you still have the same kind of an awareness

07:04.083 --> 07:06.917
which you had before, and you want to go to the same,

07:07.291 --> 07:10.667
it can fail also like animals, you see.

07:10.999 --> 07:13.083
If you live with the animals,

07:13.375 --> 07:16.250
even human beings can become like animals.

07:17.542 --> 07:20.208
So the Sahaja yogis must know that their awareness

07:20.500 --> 07:22.458
is changed, they are different people,

07:22.458 --> 07:25.792
they have to live with Sahaja yogis and with other

07:25.792 --> 07:28.417
human beings who are not yet realized.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.458
They can talk to them, but they must know that

07:30.709 --> 07:35.750
the Sahaja yogis are at a very different level of awareness.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.458
If they realize this point, if they understand

07:38.750 --> 07:41.999
this simple point that their awareness is very different,

07:41.999 --> 07:44.959
they would ajust much better in married life.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.583
There’s no divorce in Sahaja Yoga.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.959
We do not think of as divorce,

07:50.250 --> 07:51.792
but there’s nothing forced.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.917
I mean, if they fail to live together it’s a shame,

07:55.250 --> 07:57.583
but so far we have had no divorces.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.250
But as the people are coming from every

08:00.583 --> 08:03.041
sort of culture and things, there is a possibility

08:03.375 --> 08:06.291
that people may like to divorce legally.

08:06.542 --> 08:09.667
But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like divorce,

08:09.999 --> 08:12.041
but there’s no force on anyone.

08:13.333 --> 08:16.917
One must try to understand marriage,

08:17.125 --> 08:19.583
that it is for your enjoyment.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.583
If you cannot your enjoyment,

08:21.917 --> 08:25.333
you cannot enjoy the marriage, then it is of no use.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.834
In Sahaja Yoga it is to be ensured

08:28.125 --> 08:31.041
that people enjoy their marriages,

08:31.041 --> 08:34.291
and live very well, happily with each other.

08:38.792 --> 08:43.333
It is the responsibility of both the people in Sahaja Yoga.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.625
But say in My case, own case, My husband

08:45.917 --> 08:49.208
was not a realized soul, nor did he understood realization,

08:49.542 --> 08:53.583
nor was he a seeker. Despite all these ….

08:53.999 --> 08:58.208
It would like to come to Me for sitting in My lap now!

09:06.041 --> 09:08.125
And despite all that, you see,

09:08.375 --> 09:11.625
I didn’t get upset or anything, I didn’t push him.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.500
I didn’t push anyone.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.417
I said, “Gradually he will be able to see it clearly.”

09:16.667 --> 09:18.667
So even if the person, another person

09:18.999 --> 09:21.500
is not a realized soul one can manage it very well,

09:21.750 --> 09:23.625
and can live very happily.

09:23.875 --> 09:28.542
But in case you get both the people realized,

09:28.917 --> 09:31.834
then it’s a much better thing and should be enjoyed.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.667
But the interest should be in Sahaja Yoga.

09:34.667 --> 09:38.250
If you have other interests then there could be problems,

09:38.250 --> 09:41.959
because a Sahaja yogi would not tolerate his wife or

09:42.208 --> 09:44.959
a Sahaja yogini would not tolerate her husband

09:44.959 --> 09:47.625
to waste his energy on nonsensical things.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.959
And a new sort of conflict will start between

09:51.166 --> 09:54.417
Sahaja Yoga and the Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yoginis.

09:54.750 --> 09:58.999
So it should never be a matter of conflict, because

09:59.291 --> 10:02.041
we have so many now ways and methods of finding out

10:02.417 --> 10:03.999
what’s the matter with us.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.917
And if there is anything wrong with us,

10:05.917 --> 10:08.000
we should try to face it and clear it out.

10:08.333 --> 10:12.083
We should not try to clear each other’s chakras, but our own.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.208
Actually, we do not pay attention to ourselves,

10:14.458 --> 10:16.333
we start paying attention to others.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.583
Moreover, I must say that Sahaja Yoga marriages

10:20.834 --> 10:24.834
will be the most successful marriages – have to be.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.500
They will re-establish the institution of marriage

10:27.750 --> 10:29.583
on very sound basis.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.250
There’s no doubt about it.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.750
And those who’ll be married in Sahaja Yoga

10:33.750 --> 10:38.291
will be really remarkably happy married couples.

10:38.291 --> 10:42.667
But there will be an attack of the negativity on them

10:42.667 --> 10:44.583
as soon as they get married,

10:44.917 --> 10:50.834
because it is not a very happy thing

10:50.834 --> 10:52.999
for these negative forces to see

10:53.250 --> 10:55.166
that people are happily married.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.041
And they would try their level best

10:57.291 --> 10:58.875
to bring all sorts of problems,

10:59.083 --> 11:01.375
all sorts of complications in the beginning,

11:01.375 --> 11:03.792
to see that these marriages are broken.

11:03.792 --> 11:05.959
And when you start playing into their hands

11:06.250 --> 11:09.041
you will also be spoiling the chances

11:09.375 --> 11:11.375
of getting good realized souls to you,

11:11.709 --> 11:14.125
because they would not accept the situation.

11:14.417 --> 11:16.417
If you have been quarreling in the beginning also

11:16.750 --> 11:19.542
it’s not good, because you go down in their estimation.

11:19.875 --> 11:24.792
So you have to be very patient, very soft and

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
good to each other, to see that you create

11:28.291 --> 11:31.709
an atmosphere of invitation for these great souls

11:31.999 --> 11:33.333
to come on this Earth.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.999
And if that is not so, then they will wait,

11:37.208 --> 11:41.000
they will not incarnate, because they don’t want

11:41.250 --> 11:42.834
to have parents who are quarreling,

11:42.834 --> 11:45.500
who are fighting, who are suspecting,

11:45.750 --> 11:47.750
who are troubling each other.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.999
Now, one has to know that Sahaja Yoga marriage

11:51.250 --> 11:53.999
has a precise reason.

11:54.875 --> 11:57.291
It is not you are marrying just out of fashion;

11:57.667 --> 12:01.333
you are marrying because you want to have children

12:01.333 --> 12:05.208
who are realized souls, on this Earth to come.

12:05.208 --> 12:09.583
We’ll give them a place, parentage to do that.

12:12.709 --> 12:14.917
And if you do not understand the value

12:15.250 --> 12:17.834
of that marriage, then it is better

12:18.709 --> 12:21.166
not to be married in Sahaja Yoga.

12:21.166 --> 12:23.709
It’s better to spare the Sahaja Yoga.

12:23.959 --> 12:27.000
There’s only one snag in Sahaja Yoga is this,

12:27.291 --> 12:29.625
that you are all born of the same Mother,

12:30.375 --> 12:33.083
so you are all brothers and sisters in a way.

12:33.792 --> 12:36.000
But when you are going to marry each other,

12:36.417 --> 12:39.125
then this point becomes a little funny,

12:39.417 --> 12:42.792
that how can a brother marry a sister?

12:43.083 --> 12:48.208
Now, we can say like that, that I would say that

12:48.500 --> 12:51.375
it would be better if you marry not in the same

12:51.792 --> 12:54.500
community, but marry from somewhere else.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.250
At the most a Sydney Sahaja yogi should marry

12:57.250 --> 12:59.375
a Melbourne Sahaja yogi.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.709
Some distance should be like that, so that

13:01.959 --> 13:04.417
it is kept like not brothers and sisters,

13:04.709 --> 13:05.999
should be better.

13:06.250 --> 13:09.417
But I’ve seen when this happens there is more conflict,

13:09.875 --> 13:12.208
because they still carry on with the idea that

13:12.458 --> 13:14.875
they are from Melbourne and another from –

13:14.875 --> 13:20.208
(what do you call it?) – Sydney.

13:20.583 --> 13:23.333
(Just I can’t tell them about it) – Sydney.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.375
Now the Sydney and Melbourne

13:25.375 --> 13:28.208
should not be a matter of conflict.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.625
Because as soon as they start quarreling they’ll say,

13:30.917 --> 13:33.583
“Oh, you Melburnian, I know you are like that.”

13:33.834 --> 13:36.125
And she’ll say, “You Sydneians, you are like that.”

13:36.125 --> 13:38.125
And immediately you become like that,

13:38.125 --> 13:39.999
and you start quarreling about it.

13:39.999 --> 13:42.250
So you must know that you are not a Sydneian

13:42.250 --> 13:46.417
or a Melburnian, but you are nothing but a Sahaja yogi.

13:46.417 --> 13:49.792
And Sahaja yogi has no caste, community or any race,

13:49.792 --> 13:56.166
or any, any religion, or also no bar of any nation.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.417
Whatever nation you come from, you are a Sahaja yogi,

13:58.417 --> 14:02.000
you are a universal being – you are.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.458
You can feel the vibrations of anyone sitting down here,

14:04.458 --> 14:09.041
whether he’s from Hawaii or from America, doesn’t matter.

14:09.041 --> 14:12.166
So, when you can feel about everyone, that means

14:12.166 --> 14:14.875
you are no more belonging to any community

14:15.125 --> 14:18.750
or any particular country, you are a universal being.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.417
And that’s what we have to do,

14:20.417 --> 14:22.417
we have to create more universal beings.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.375
And to expedite that, we want to get these great

14:25.667 --> 14:28.959
souls on this Earth, so it’s a very important work.

14:28.959 --> 14:30.583
They have to be on this Earth, because they are

14:30.875 --> 14:33.083
the great channels for this divine work.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.999
Once they start descending on this Earth,

14:35.333 --> 14:37.542
the real ones, it will all expedite,

14:37.792 --> 14:39.959
it will be such a great – you don’t know,

14:40.250 --> 14:44.166
it will be such a great sudden explosion of Sahaja Yoga.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.291
You’ll be amazed how it can grow faster

14:47.291 --> 14:49.375
with these people coming down.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.000
And we should try to make such arrangements

14:52.250 --> 14:56.250
that we get the real blessings of those people,

14:56.500 --> 14:58.208
that they come down on this Earth.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.166
It’s very important.

15:00.417 --> 15:02.625
So I would request you to think about the marriage

15:02.999 --> 15:06.792
from a new angle and from new ideas by which

15:07.000 --> 15:11.125
you can really understand the value,

15:11.542 --> 15:14.542
the value of these marriages.

15:14.792 --> 15:17.583
And then you make it a successful marriage,

15:17.834 --> 15:21.834
and not a failure or a nonsense of it.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.375
That’s such a great sinful thing to do,

15:24.375 --> 15:28.166
because you are married before realized souls.

15:28.417 --> 15:33.875
So there is no question of being just married

15:34.083 --> 15:36.291
like other people are married, and then they,

15:36.291 --> 15:42.166
they take a name-plate on their car saying

15:42.166 --> 15:44.458
“Just married” – and they go,

15:44.917 --> 15:47.917
they are going to a divorce case.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.458
There cannot be such a thing for Sahaja Yog –

15:51.458 --> 15:53.041
it’s a serious thing.

15:53.041 --> 15:56.375
If you are not serious enough about it, better not marry.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.500
If you have expectations about marriage,

15:58.500 --> 16:00.500
it is better not to marry.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.291
It is better not to marry.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.291
Nobody is going to force you to marry.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.999
Just say, “No, not at all, I’m not going to.”

16:06.999 --> 16:09.041
But if you are going to go on like this,

16:09.041 --> 16:11.625
you are really be harming Sahaja Yoga

16:11.625 --> 16:13.583
in the worst possible way.

16:13.875 --> 16:17.083
It is like stabbing Sahaja Yoga from the back.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.000
So there is no need for you to get married,

16:20.333 --> 16:23.125
in case you do not want to have it.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.083
On the contrary, it would be better that

16:25.333 --> 16:30.000
there are many married couples who can produce children,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.166
and they can have those great people born to them.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.125
But if you think that adjustment and all that means

16:36.417 --> 16:39.875
all kinds of these old ideas of married life,

16:40.083 --> 16:42.500
it’s better that you do not get married.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.083
It’s a new heavenly marriage,

16:44.333 --> 16:46.542
for which you should be prepared to receive

16:46.834 --> 16:50.458
the beauty and the blessings, and also

16:50.792 --> 16:56.500
the greatest of greatest, the ultimate meaning of it.

16:56.959 --> 17:01.125
I hope you will understand that Sahaja Yoga

17:01.375 --> 17:04.959
is emphasizing on marriages, and we do not believe

17:05.250 --> 17:08.041
in any asceticism, running away from family life.

17:08.417 --> 17:12.542
We believe that family life is the most important thing.

17:12.792 --> 17:15.750
We have to establish it very well on this Earth,

17:15.750 --> 17:19.083
and that we have to see in these beautiful nests

17:19.333 --> 17:22.999
of divine love that great souls are born,

17:23.208 --> 17:25.792
and we have to continue with it.

17:25.792 --> 17:29.667
There’s no escape from having a very good married life.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.959
And I wish you, all of you,

17:32.166 --> 17:35.375
that you will have a very good happy married life.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.750
And those who are not married, I wish them

17:37.999 --> 17:41.792
that they also will have a very happy married life.

17:42.041 --> 17:44.917
Now I’ve been married, I think thirty-sixth year is this,

17:45.166 --> 17:45.917
My marriage today.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.041
There’s so many years have passed but still,

17:48.417 --> 17:51.583
I still feel like a bride with My husband,

17:51.583 --> 17:53.709
because really we have been very wise people

17:53.959 --> 17:56.083
to live like that. And of course there are

17:56.375 --> 17:58.500
ups and downs, but ultimately

17:58.500 --> 18:02.417
one feels very different about the whole thing.

18:02.792 --> 18:04.999
He has sent a beautiful letter today,

18:04.999 --> 18:07.999
thanking you all for your kindness shown to Me,

18:08.333 --> 18:12.417
and for all the kindness you have shown to him.

18:14.625 --> 18:18.000
So we should have the puja: is today as a Gruha Laxmi

18:18.291 --> 18:21.208
you are worshipping Me. As a Gruha Lakshmi in you

18:21.542 --> 18:23.999
and which is very essential also, to worship Me

18:24.250 --> 18:26.375
as a Gruha Lakshmi, because you all have a problem

18:26.667 --> 18:29.959
with your Gruha Lakshmi. That’s the left Nabhi.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.208
So I hope it will work out better for you,

18:32.458 --> 18:35.250
and we’ll start with the puja.

18:36.458 --> 18:39.375
After this short puja that we have,

18:39.709 --> 18:44.083
then we’ll start with this Devi havan,

18:44.083 --> 18:47.125
because this we have not been able to do so far,

18:47.417 --> 18:49.041
and this is very important.

18:49.417 --> 18:52.417
We have to somehow or other manage it today if possible.

18:53.250 --> 18:57.583
We should do thousand Names, would be a very good idea.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.834
Who else is getting married?

19:42.291 --> 19:44.750
You also? Get these two.

19:45.999 --> 19:50.041
Would you come, too? Please come.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.083
These are very handy things, eh?

20:23.542 --> 20:25.208
Very handy.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.291
Now everyone sit down.

21:51.792 --> 21:53.375
Yes, that’s all right. Come along, sit down.

21:53.709 --> 21:55.375
Now, who else is there?

21:56.917 --> 21:58.542
You can sit there. You can move there.

25:45.834 --> 25:47.458
First is Ganesha Puja.

25:59.542 --> 26:00.999
Tell the meaning of it.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.125
They should know the meaning.

26:24.166 --> 26:28.208
This is a – I have told him to today say it out.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.291
Now this is what we were saying,

26:30.625 --> 26:32.542
that Christ is described in short.

26:32.875 --> 26:34.417
This is very short description.

26:34.417 --> 26:36.583
And what He is, actually His all aspects

26:36.959 --> 26:39.333
have been described in short, again in short,

26:39.583 --> 26:40.333
very much in short.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.875
These few things he will be reading it and

26:44.208 --> 26:47.542
explaining it to you, while you just wash Me.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.000
Ganesha Atharva Sheersha is begun

27:10.083 --> 27:13.083
Yogi: Now here we worship the Lord Jesus

27:13.959 --> 27:16.625
in the name of Lord Ganesha.

27:17.667 --> 27:23.083
He is supposed to be in totality the essence

27:23.417 --> 27:25.542
of all the principles.

27:26.667 --> 27:30.417
principles, all the principles - Tattwa

27:35.959 --> 27:37.999
Then he is supposed to be the kartasi,

27:39.291 --> 27:41.709
Shri Mataji: The Doer

27:47.166 --> 27:51.291
Then he says twameva kevalam dartasi means he is the

27:52.250 --> 27:55.959
Shri Mataji.... Support. So He is the support.

28:01.333 --> 28:05.709
He is the one who takes away all the problems.

28:06.208 --> 28:07.750
He’s the one.

28:08.583 --> 28:11.166
He’s the sucker of all the problems of the universe.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.500
Brahma, Brahma.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.500
Brahma is this Brahma shakti, you see,

28:21.750 --> 28:23.291
this pranava. Pranava.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.375
Present in you as the spirit.

28:33.875 --> 28:38.834
He resides you as spirit.

28:40.959 --> 28:41.500
Is the truth.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.166
Not “He says the truth”, but He is the truth.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.999
The disciples. In the disciple principle.

29:44.792 --> 29:46.792
He exists in all the directions.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.917
He is the complete literature.

30:25.875 --> 30:26.417
Joy.

30:32.792 --> 30:37.000
“You are the one who is the all-pervading Power within us.”

30:46.208 --> 30:48.583
“Sat chit ananda dvitiyosi” means

30:50.375 --> 30:56.291
“Nobody can compare You to Your capacity

30:56.959 --> 31:00.083
to be Sat Chit Ananda.”

31:02.208 --> 31:03.041
Attention.

31:03.792 --> 31:06.875
Ananda means joy.

31:07.667 --> 31:10.875
And “Nobody can be compared with You.”

31:18.250 --> 31:20.333
The Creator.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.250
Destroys

31:58.333 --> 32:00.041
"Tish thati" means it stays:

32:00.458 --> 32:03.166
“The whole world stays because of You.

32:03.917 --> 32:07.583
As long as You are there, the world will stay.”

32:23.750 --> 32:25.291
When you are completely,

32:25.583 --> 32:27.000
the whole world is destroyed,

32:27.333 --> 32:28.875
that time only You are there.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.000
You are the witness.

32:39.041 --> 32:43.750
Everybody can only experience You and nothing else.

32:49.625 --> 32:52.041
Him, through Him, through Him.

32:59.999 --> 33:04.375
The water. He is the akasha.

33:12.917 --> 33:19.000
He’s the sky, ether. All the elements.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.999
Guided by Him.

33:34.291 --> 33:39.083
There are, you see, four stages of your sound,

33:39.458 --> 33:43.000
you see, when they – para, pashanti, madhyama.

33:43.417 --> 33:47.709
You see, there are four stages of your sound

33:48.000 --> 33:49.667
that starts from here.

33:57.792 --> 34:00.458
You see, the sound starts from here.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.417
This is para. Sound starts from para.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.875
From here it starts.

34:06.166 --> 34:09.417
Then it goes to pashanti and the heart just pulsate.

34:09.750 --> 34:12.166
But it is, pashanti means it is just watching.

34:12.458 --> 34:14.208
Here it is madhyama.

34:14.542 --> 34:16.458
It is the center, means it doesn’t,

34:16.875 --> 34:18.792
neither watch nor this thing.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.709
And then, at the mouth part it becomes eloquent.

34:22.999 --> 34:25.083
So “all these four stages of the sound

34:26.083 --> 34:29.458
are governed by You.” By You.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.208
No, no,gunas virtues nahi.

34:57.542 --> 35:00.875
Gunas means moods, moods, moods; qualities.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.917
You see, tamo guna and rajo guna and satya guna:

35:04.125 --> 35:06.542
He’s beyond them, He’s transcended.

35:06.834 --> 35:09.375
You see, for Him there’s nothing like sin.

35:09.375 --> 35:14.166
Whatever He does is divine.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.709
“You are beyond Your body.”

35:21.250 --> 35:22.709
“You are beyond time.”

35:29.792 --> 35:31.417
Mooladhara Chakra.

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
“You are the three powers.”

35:42.333 --> 35:45.333
Three powers. Trigunatmika -means all these

35:45.834 --> 35:48.834
three powers: Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.

35:59.875 --> 36:03.417
“Upon You.” All the time.

36:09.291 --> 36:10.792
He’s the Creator.

36:11.083 --> 36:14.125
He’s the Sustainer.

36:14.542 --> 36:16.208
He’s the Protector also.

36:16.709 --> 36:19.083
He’s the one destroys.

36:21.917 --> 36:23.834
Indra is the God of the Gods.

36:41.166 --> 36:44.999
He is the sound of God – Aumkara.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.999
He’s the assemblage of all that.

37:48.875 --> 37:53.417
Gana means all the, all the celestial beings

37:53.834 --> 37:56.417
on the left-hand side are called as ganas, you see?

37:57.041 --> 38:00.792
They are – the leader of them is St. Michael.

38:03.750 --> 38:07.125
He is even before them, He’s born even before them.

38:07.583 --> 38:09.917
He’s even higher than them.

38:23.250 --> 38:25.458
You see, this is what is Alpha and Omega:

38:25.917 --> 38:29.125
that He is, He’s the first Word that is created,

38:30.041 --> 38:32.542
and He is the last Word,

38:33.375 --> 38:36.375
He’s above the last Word that is created.

39:26.583 --> 39:29.583
The bindu gives you salvation.

39:37.792 --> 39:38.500
You see the vibrations,

39:39.458 --> 39:41.375
I don’t know if you can see them?

39:41.625 --> 39:44.875
It looks like a comma – “anusvarah” is commas.

39:45.291 --> 39:48.417
So that’s how you – each side like little,

39:48.834 --> 39:50.709
little commas; if you can see them ….

40:07.875 --> 40:10.667
See, the complete Aumkara is: first is Ga-karah,

40:10.999 --> 40:14.834
is Ganapati, Ga. “Ga-karah purva-rupam”:

40:15.125 --> 40:16.583
the first is, you see.

40:16.834 --> 40:19.166
You take the form of Ganesha in the beginning,

40:19.166 --> 40:21.458
“purva-rupam” – Ganesha is in that.

40:21.792 --> 40:24.834
Then You take the form of Aumkara …

40:30.166 --> 40:33.834
And the last is when You become just a comma.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.667
Sound is mantras, you see.

41:12.041 --> 41:14.291
To know Him through the mantras,

41:14.792 --> 41:16.792
you have to learn the Ganesha-vidya,

41:17.166 --> 41:20.166
is the Knowledge of Jesus.

41:20.542 --> 41:22.166
If you have to know the mantras,

41:22.458 --> 41:25.000
you have to know through the knowledge that

41:25.333 --> 41:27.083
the whole science is called,

41:27.542 --> 41:29.917
is the Knowledge of Ganesha.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.083
Or you can call the Vidya of Ganesha,

41:32.375 --> 41:34.041
means the Technique of Ganesha.

41:34.333 --> 41:37.041
And if you have to know how the mantras work out,

41:37.500 --> 41:38.166
this is the science.

41:38.166 --> 41:39.750
The science is called as Ganesha-vidya,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.709
is all His science.

41:50.792 --> 41:52.875
He, that’s why He’s called as Ganaka,

41:53.166 --> 41:54.917
Ganaka-rishihi, that’s why He’s called,

41:55.208 --> 41:56.625
because He’s the master of that.

41:56.999 --> 42:01.917
He’s the master of the art of mantras, the sounds.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.625
Chandah.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.625
It’s a mantra – Gayatri is one of the mantras, you see.

42:17.166 --> 42:19.041
And it’s on the right-hand side.

42:22.417 --> 42:29.250
Chandah is … music of all the mantras.

42:31.417 --> 42:33.792
The rhythm, rhythm, rhythm.

42:35.792 --> 42:37.083
You see, you have to say mantras

42:37.458 --> 42:39.667
with a certain rhythm, and He’s the rhythm.

43:13.041 --> 43:19.291
How to, awaken this deity.

43:25.709 --> 43:27.709
[Yogi: “Aum Gam Ganapataye namah” –

43:28.083 --> 43:31.041
this is the mantra for awakening this deity.]

43:57.208 --> 43:59.083
You see, the Ganesha-vidya.

44:06.125 --> 44:09.917
One tooth; because with the another one He writes.

44:14.917 --> 44:17.041
And He’s got the trunk.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.625
Is one of the loops.

44:22.959 --> 44:25.041
See, He controls you with a loop.

44:25.375 --> 44:26.667
If you try to misbehave,

44:26.999 --> 44:29.667
then He puts a loop round you and pulls you back.

44:35.875 --> 44:41.000
Yes. Ankusha is that you use it on the elephant,

44:42.083 --> 44:48.375
to control. On the elephant. Ankusha.

44:49.583 --> 44:53.250
But it is a very, it’s a guiding instrument.

45:03.959 --> 45:05.875
Protection.

45:16.667 --> 45:19.667
I mean, something very humble animal, very humble,

45:20.125 --> 45:22.125
is mouse for Him.

45:22.458 --> 45:25.333
And for Christ also, the donkey,

45:25.709 --> 45:29.500
which is the humblest animal.

45:40.166 --> 45:41.999
Red clothes.

45:54.458 --> 45:58.999
At least on His chakras we should put red.

47:14.291 --> 47:18.166
Good yogi, not a – … No, no, “a yogi” means

47:18.500 --> 47:21.875
anybody going to church: that’s not a yogi.

47:22.166 --> 47:26.291
See, a yogi … yoga.

47:32.542 --> 47:36.667
You see, “evam dhyayati” means “by which you know.”

47:59.750 --> 48:02.208
Only the yogis, again.

48:28.875 --> 48:30.500
Bow to You.

48:39.208 --> 48:39.999
Because He’s purity.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.500
of Shiva. Shiva is the ….

49:04.041 --> 49:06.250
You know Shiva, you know.

49:09.250 --> 49:16.500
You are the one, You are the statue of blessings.

49:17.542 --> 49:19.875
You are the statue of blessings.

49:27.875 --> 49:30.333
This is just the abridged form.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.583
So this is nothing to understand Him.

49:39.959 --> 49:41.375
But just this is said,

49:41.625 --> 49:43.291
is just in the beginning, to make it ….

50:37.291 --> 50:41.166
See, they’re gods, you see.

50:41.625 --> 50:44.417
You’re also gods now, because you have all the powers.

50:44.750 --> 50:50.000
Prayed to the – prayed to Vishnu to create

50:50.458 --> 50:52.125
a power by which they,

50:52.542 --> 50:55.500
all these horrible devils can be destroyed.

50:57.041 --> 50:59.917
And then a Goddess was created.

51:00.250 --> 51:02.875
This story is better to hear.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.709
You’ve got “Devi Bhagwat” – you have got it?

51:46.750 --> 51:49.291
But I wish you had read it. All right.

51:54.166 --> 51:57.500
You know the story? All right … then say the mantras.

55:25.375 --> 55:27.125
“Mahalakshmi Stotram.”

56:00.125 --> 56:02.333
Raul Bai is very particular about the ritual

56:02.583 --> 56:03.834
to be done properly.

56:04.125 --> 56:06.125
I said the brain should be all right, first of all.

56:06.458 --> 56:08.375
If you go on doing everything properly,

56:08.667 --> 56:10.458
doing this, do this.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.417
First of all ego must go, otherwise what’s the use?

01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:33.834
There is some yoghurt in that?

01:09:14.291 --> 01:09:16.875
You have; two pujas is too much!

01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:20.999
You see the raktagandha: He likes to be,

01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:25.917
He likes to be covered with raktagandha, you see.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:31.250
You see, the kind of a tree we get,

01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:36.291
called as raktagandha, which is like the sandalwood

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:40.000
but is red-colored; and He likes it to be

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:42.834
all the time covered with it.

01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:44.959
That’s why I have to cover Myself,

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:49.959
it’s to cover this portion – there He resides.

01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:56.125
Raktagandha. “Rakta” means blood, and “gandha”

01:11:56.417 --> 01:12:00.709
means this particular type of a sandalwood it is,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.792
which is of the red color,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.792
which is rubbed and is put here.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.333
This is typically Bali, or Australian?

01:14:56.834 --> 01:14:59.250
There’s so much vibrations, all the rest I’m doing it.

01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:07.999
She says, you have said all the mantras,

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:10.834
she says, now she’s finished.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.959
Let’s see who gets the best!

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:03.000
Where is Barbara?

01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:07.083
Come along, take your photograph.

01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:15.041
Let her have one. Let’s see now, and she’ll decide.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.500
See, your photographs also depend

01:17:37.834 --> 01:17:42.417
on your state of mind, very much so.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:57.125
Done? All right? Now – May God bless you.

01:17:58.125 --> 01:17:59.917
Does he want? All right.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:04.041
You can come closer, for My feet.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.166
Come along, you have to do My feet also.

01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:22.125
Done? All right.

01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:03.166
Of the sanctity of marriage.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.834
May God bless you, and give you the full idea

01:20:06.125 --> 01:20:08.625
of sanctity of marriage.

01:21:27.166 --> 01:21:29.083
Let’s start the ….

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.375
Now, you all have to get up from here,

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:52.041
and some people who have come for the first time

01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:55.417
should come forward.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.208
If you have come for the first time,

01:21:59.542 --> 01:22:01.291
you should come forward.

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:06.000
And you can also take a stool for yourself

01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:07.917
or something, or a chair.
