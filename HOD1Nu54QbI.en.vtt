04:45.760 --> 04:50.200
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.000
At the very outset we have to know

04:58.200 --> 05:02.060
that truth is what it is.

05:07.080 --> 05:11.100
We cannot conceptualize it,

05:16.380 --> 05:20.660
nor can we organize it,

05:21.160 --> 05:25.680
neither we can order it.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.080
So we have to know it.

05:38.300 --> 05:42.200
I know in Finland, I came here in 1980,

05:42.380 --> 05:47.000
I found people were big seekers, no doubt.

05:59.080 --> 06:03.060
And they are seeking the truth.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.360
But at the same time you have to know

06:09.580 --> 06:14.960
that truth is a manifestation

06:15.340 --> 06:19.200
on your central nervous system.

06:29.660 --> 06:33.540
Like we have to feel

06:34.120 --> 06:37.680
this all-pervading power

06:37.880 --> 06:41.140
all around us.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.620
You have to feel it on your finger tips.

06:54.980 --> 06:59.800
It's not just what one may claim about,

06:59.980 --> 07:04.400
but it actually has to happen to you.

07:09.840 --> 07:14.920
From ameba stage now we have come to human stage.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.400
And there is a little breakthrough

07:22.600 --> 07:27.880
which we have to achieve in this lifetime.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.940
So how do we do it? Many people ask me,

07:38.120 --> 07:42.040
"How do we do it?"

07:45.360 --> 07:49.320
Now, how do we become human beings?

07:51.700 --> 07:54.460
Spontaneously.

07:54.660 --> 07:58.220
Within us is the power, which spontaneously acts.

08:03.180 --> 08:06.580
Because it's a living process.

08:06.780 --> 08:11.840
It is not an artificial process, but a living process.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.340
Like this Mother Earth sprouts a seed,

08:18.540 --> 08:21.680
spontaneously.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.940
Because the Mother Earth has got the capacity,

08:28.140 --> 08:32.520
while the seed has got built-in properties.

08:41.880 --> 08:47.020
In the same way, within us is also built-in this instrument.

08:52.320 --> 08:58.160
Now, you have to have an open mind of a scientist,

09:02.160 --> 09:07.340
that you should see for yourself it works or not.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.680
There should not be any blind faith

09:12.880 --> 09:16.600
about me or about anything.

09:21.880 --> 09:26.300
We have lived with concept, all throughout.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.180
Some people believe into this, some people believe into that,

09:33.360 --> 09:37.500
some people believe into that.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.560
So this belief has led you nowhere.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.860
Whatever belief you may have,

09:50.080 --> 09:53.780
whatever religion you may follow,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.500
whatever philosophies you may follow,

09:57.720 --> 10:01.940
every human being is capable of committing any sin.

10:14.340 --> 10:21.160
So, as we are ourselves, we are miraculous things.

10:27.560 --> 10:33.160
Look at the eyes; are best camera also you could ever think of!

10:38.980 --> 10:43.840
Look at our brain, what we have created out of it!

10:48.480 --> 10:51.240
Look at our hands!

10:51.400 --> 10:53.660
All this is a miracle.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.000
And look at the flowers.

11:04.880 --> 11:09.240
These are so beautiful, coming out of a seed.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.160
Who does this work?

11:18.600 --> 11:22.040
Who does all the living work?

11:23.320 --> 11:26.180
It is done by the all-pervading power,

11:26.360 --> 11:30.780
which is a subtle power of God's love.

11:37.860 --> 11:41.580
In the modern times, if you take the name of God in the West,

11:41.760 --> 11:44.940
people don't like it.

11:50.920 --> 11:57.040
They also conceptualize by saying, "We don't believe in God."

12:03.540 --> 12:05.880
But this is very unscientific.

12:06.080 --> 12:11.760
You should find out, first of all, if there is God or not.

12:18.180 --> 12:20.480
Without finding out any facts,

12:20.660 --> 12:23.220
if you say there is nothing like God,

12:23.400 --> 12:26.980
then you are outside of it.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.900
Now, if I say that there is God

12:40.100 --> 12:44.100
and there is the all-pervading power of God Almighty,

12:44.300 --> 12:47.200
which does all the subtle work,

12:47.400 --> 12:53.680
then as a scientist you take it as a hypothesis.

13:05.800 --> 13:10.020
And if it is proved, you have to accept it.

13:15.700 --> 13:21.220
So as it is the living process, you can't pay for it.

13:26.520 --> 13:31.020
Those people who take money from you for doing anything

13:31.220 --> 13:35.080
that is called as God's work,

13:35.300 --> 13:37.980
or increasing your awareness,

13:38.180 --> 13:41.480
are all false people.

13:50.360 --> 13:54.940
There are some who will say that, "You can fly in the air."

13:59.000 --> 14:03.060
But we are flying in the air systematically.

14:06.940 --> 14:11.860
But if you just take that some of you just start flying half way in the air,

14:12.060 --> 14:15.380
what will happen?

14:15.960 --> 14:19.800
If you people start just flying half way, you see,

14:19.960 --> 14:23.420
in somewhere, not systematically.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.020
Is that what is going to happen to us,

14:33.200 --> 14:37.000
that we are going to become birds or what?

14:40.780 --> 14:46.480
Then some people say that, "You start jumping like a frog."

14:52.220 --> 14:57.400
Are we going to become like frogs or earthworms now?

15:02.080 --> 15:06.000
What is going to happen to us

15:06.220 --> 15:11.800
is that we are going to become people of absolute truth.

15:18.780 --> 15:22.060
Absolutely righteous.

15:23.260 --> 15:26.580
Absolutely compassionate.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.320
Absolutely loving.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.760
Moreover, we are going to have

15:34.960 --> 15:38.640
the dynamics of truth.

15:45.240 --> 15:49.320
Like Christ, when he saw Mary Magdalene;

15:49.500 --> 15:51.860
he had nothing to do with the prostitute,

15:52.040 --> 15:54.740
just stood up and said,

15:54.920 --> 15:58.260
"Those who have not done any sin

15:58.440 --> 16:01.800
can throw the stone at Me."

16:16.400 --> 16:19.420
That is the courage, that is the courage

16:19.620 --> 16:25.220
of a person who knows the absolute.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.720
While we live in a relative world.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.440
We don't know which theory is correct.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.620
It's all the mental projection.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.800
And nowadays people have become so much mental

16:58.000 --> 17:02.360
that I don't know, how will they recognize the truth?

17:11.820 --> 17:16.040
Because the mental projection moves in a linear way,

17:16.240 --> 17:20.540
it cannot sustain itself, because it's not the truth.

17:29.140 --> 17:32.320
It cannot sustain itself.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.120
So it recoils.

17:37.680 --> 17:41.100
We had science,

17:41.860 --> 17:44.580
so we produced ultimately going to the extremes

17:44.760 --> 17:47.960
atom bomb, hydrogen bomb, this bomb, that bomb

17:48.160 --> 17:51.520
for our destruction.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.960
We started cutting the trees, so ecological problem has come.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.980
We started using the machines, now become slaves of machines.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.960
Machines are for us, we are not for machines!

18:29.420 --> 18:33.420
So there is no balance in our life.

18:34.560 --> 18:40.020
Anything we start, we would start going to the extremes.

18:45.740 --> 18:49.640
And then we feel guilty.

18:51.420 --> 18:55.440
We think, "Oh, we have done something wrong."

18:58.680 --> 19:02.520
So, one side we start using our ego too much

19:02.700 --> 19:07.740
and then we feel guilty, "we should not have done like that."

19:15.820 --> 19:19.440
So the knowledge that you have about science,

19:19.640 --> 19:24.460
about all other things, is the knowledge of the tree.

19:34.660 --> 19:38.960
But this is the knowledge of your roots.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.840
The tree that grows out of proportion

19:47.040 --> 19:50.560
without having relationship with the roots

19:50.760 --> 19:54.320
is definitely going to be destroyed.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.480
So through Sahaja yoga,

20:04.660 --> 20:09.480
sahaja, 'sahaj' means 'born with you', is 'spontaneous'.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.940
And 'yoga' means 'the union with the divine'.

20:23.960 --> 20:30.500
So this Sahaja yoga is a right of every human being.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.480
This is the last breakthrough, as I told you,

20:36.660 --> 20:40.200
of our evolutionary process.

20:43.940 --> 20:48.460
As a result of that you get powers, you become powerful.

20:48.640 --> 20:53.380
You do not become somebody's slave, but you become powerful.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.620
You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

21:04.800 --> 21:08.800
which is the all-pervading power.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.860
And you get the experience of actualization

21:18.060 --> 21:20.940
of your second birth,

21:21.120 --> 21:26.520
which we can say an actualization of a baptism.

21:33.100 --> 21:38.700
You feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.580
You feel it!

21:51.960 --> 21:56.840
Then you start understanding your own centers

21:57.020 --> 22:02.760
which are within you, and also the centers that belong to others.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.820
It is like this instrument (mike with wire)

22:13.000 --> 22:17.460
if it is not connected to the means, it has no meaning.

22:22.560 --> 22:25.440
In the same way, our lives have no meaning

22:25.640 --> 22:28.680
unless and until we are connected to this

22:28.880 --> 22:33.680
all-pervading power, which has created us.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.380
I mean of course, as a result of that

22:47.560 --> 22:51.580
so many diseases get cured completely.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.360
We have records and records and records

23:00.540 --> 23:04.340
of so many diseases like breast cancer, another,

23:04.520 --> 23:08.660
so many incurable diseases being cured.

23:18.180 --> 23:21.740
It happens automatically.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.360
You yourself become a doctor.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.180
Because you can feel the diseases of another person

23:32.360 --> 23:35.400
on your fingertips. And if you know, how to correct them,

23:35.580 --> 23:38.820
you are a doctor!

23:50.100 --> 23:53.680
Mentally you become so peaceful.

23:59.820 --> 24:05.200
You feel such joy and such a peace within yourself.

24:12.020 --> 24:14.720
In Helsinki, there is a big talk of peace.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.180
Because, I think, for the safety we have.

24:18.380 --> 24:22.300
(For translator:) Big talk of peace in Helsinki.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.280
And this peace, as there are Peace Foundations,

24:31.460 --> 24:36.600
'peace' this thing, 'peace' that, but nobody has peace within.

24:44.240 --> 24:48.440
So, you establish your peace within yourself.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.360
But such a person is so compassionate,

24:56.540 --> 25:00.100
at the same time so dynamic,

25:11.700 --> 25:14.660
that you work

25:15.860 --> 25:20.040
any length of time, you are not tired.

25:25.280 --> 25:29.500
You're always feeling fresh

25:30.040 --> 25:34.000
and you give joy to others.

25:35.540 --> 25:38.180
The first thing that happens to you, that you become

25:38.340 --> 25:41.840
an innocent person.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.600
And you develop respect for yourself,

25:47.780 --> 25:51.560
because you know you your glory.

25:56.900 --> 26:01.480
You realize you are at the epitome of evolution.

26:05.440 --> 26:09.240
You no more feel guilty,

26:12.900 --> 26:17.740
because you are now one with that Divine power,

26:17.920 --> 26:22.020
which is the source of all these things.

26:27.220 --> 26:30.100
But your attention

26:30.300 --> 26:34.620
become so innocent and so powerful.

26:41.400 --> 26:45.540
What Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

26:51.420 --> 26:57.000
Your eyes become completely devoid of lust and greed.

27:05.540 --> 27:10.120
And even one glance of such a person

27:10.300 --> 27:13.640
can solve the problem

27:13.840 --> 27:17.820
of anybody in trouble or distress.

27:29.520 --> 27:34.260
So this transformation takes place spontaneously.

27:39.040 --> 27:43.740
But one has to open the mind.

27:45.900 --> 27:49.660
And to recognize that your are all capable

27:49.860 --> 27:53.280
of reaching that state.

27:57.380 --> 28:00.440
Also one thing I've noticed

28:00.620 --> 28:03.920
about, specially about Finland

28:04.100 --> 28:07.380
was that people were very simple

28:07.580 --> 28:10.520
and very humble.

28:21.340 --> 28:26.000
But unnecessarily they felt too much guilty.

28:32.380 --> 28:35.160
They have done nothing wrong so far,

28:35.340 --> 28:38.520
they've never dominated any country

28:38.700 --> 28:42.600
and I don't know why they are (feel) so guilty;

28:53.880 --> 28:59.440
to such an extend that they are very frightened also, afraid.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.860
But there is nothing to be afraid.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.840
If you are in the collective consciousness,

29:12.040 --> 29:17.280
then every nation is your friend.

29:26.240 --> 29:31.520
Like this hand will always help this hand.

29:36.100 --> 29:41.240
Because you are part and parcel of the whole.

29:44.860 --> 29:48.920
You are not hanging somewhere in the air.

29:51.860 --> 29:55.340
Today you will be amazed to know that

29:55.520 --> 29:59.760
for Helsinki we have got people from many different countries,

30:00.100 --> 30:04.560
rushing about, even, even from New Zealand.

30:12.440 --> 30:17.140
And Sahaja yoga is now working in thirty nations.

30:20.140 --> 30:23.680
And you should see the way they all are together,

30:23.860 --> 30:29.420
no quarreling, no fighting, no arguments.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.660
Just enjoying each other.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.820
More than flowers;

30:42.000 --> 30:44.680
more than flowers, more than paintings,

30:44.860 --> 30:47.580
more than anything else

30:47.780 --> 30:52.040
the best things to enjoy are human beings.

30:59.200 --> 31:04.020
But we have to develop that capacity, that state.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.540
I am sorry I am here only for one day,

31:10.720 --> 31:12.920
I wish I had come yesterday

31:13.100 --> 31:17.000
and I am very sorry that I did not come yesterday.

31:26.380 --> 31:30.700
Only thing I have to make a humble request to you all,

31:31.540 --> 31:34.600
that when you get your realization,

31:34.760 --> 31:38.020
don't get lost.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.920
I'll give you an analogy.

31:54.940 --> 31:58.860
Somebody is standing with a snake in his hand

32:00.720 --> 32:04.840
and you tell that person, "There is a snake in your hand."

32:05.020 --> 32:08.640
But he is in darkness.

32:14.400 --> 32:18.660
So, you put on the lights.

32:21.560 --> 32:25.000
He sees the lights

32:25.500 --> 32:29.240
and then he sees the snake

32:29.440 --> 32:32.660
and he is frightened.

32:32.920 --> 32:36.820
He throws away the snake, alright,

32:37.540 --> 32:41.100
but also puts off the light.

32:41.320 --> 32:44.460
Because he is frightened.

32:44.660 --> 32:48.020
That happens very much.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.940
There's nothing to be frightened.

32:58.860 --> 33:00.820
You must know

33:01.000 --> 33:04.280
that all these things which frighten you

33:04.480 --> 33:07.820
will just run away.

33:12.980 --> 33:17.340
But you have to stand on your legs.

33:20.360 --> 33:25.960
So far we have had thousands and thousands of people,

33:26.360 --> 33:29.760
in the West also,

33:29.940 --> 33:34.740
who have got their Realization. They had no problems.

33:41.500 --> 33:45.980
Also I would say that in India, say, when I go there,

33:46.180 --> 33:49.940
we have fifteen thousand people in the meeting.

33:50.140 --> 33:54.740
We have eternal football grounds, you see.

34:03.480 --> 34:08.040
Because we have a background.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.640
And the false gurus are not interested in Indians,

34:14.760 --> 34:18.960
because they have not so much money to waste.

34:20.640 --> 34:24.880
And Indians know that you are not to pay to anyone

34:25.100 --> 34:29.500
who says that "I am such and such."

34:36.700 --> 34:40.400
So it works much faster there.

34:42.280 --> 34:46.540
But in the West those sahaja yogis we have got

34:46.720 --> 34:50.860
are excellent people, very deep.

34:57.620 --> 35:01.520
Quantity is less but quality is great.

35:04.340 --> 35:10.080
I hope today it will work out among you people

35:10.300 --> 35:14.400
and then you are going to master it.

35:25.180 --> 35:29.460
This will hardly take a month at the most.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.260
But you must have determination

35:34.440 --> 35:38.320
that you are going to master this.

35:40.620 --> 35:45.020
I'll give you another analogy that when you start driving the car,

35:45.220 --> 35:49.380
there is a break and an accelerator, you use both.

35:58.020 --> 36:01.020
As the left and the right sympathetic nervous system

36:01.180 --> 36:05.000
as you have seen. (pointing to chart)

36:07.260 --> 36:10.960
But once you learn the balancing,

36:11.180 --> 36:14.880
you become automatically a driver.

36:21.360 --> 36:25.080
But still the master is sitting behind.

36:28.860 --> 36:32.860
So you have to become the master.

36:33.380 --> 36:37.300
And once you become the master, you can see the driver,

36:37.520 --> 36:42.260
the accelerator and the break. And you control it fully.

36:53.620 --> 36:57.740
All this may sound very fantastic.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.720
But you are fantastic.

37:06.280 --> 37:10.180
You are not yet aware of it.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.660
Like if you take a television in Indian village

37:14.880 --> 37:19.320
and tell them that, "You can see everything in this box."

37:19.500 --> 37:23.600
They will say, "What, this box, how can you see everything?"

37:43.840 --> 37:48.400
But if you put to the mains then they will see what the (connectivity?) it is.

37:53.460 --> 37:58.420
So in our ignorance about ourselves, we might not think much about ourselves.

38:02.780 --> 38:07.900
But each one of you is capable of achieving that state.

38:11.580 --> 38:15.780
So you have to have confidence in yourself.

38:21.300 --> 38:25.340
May God bless you all!

38:25.840 --> 38:31.280
It's a very vast ocean of knowledge

38:32.620 --> 38:36.520
and I must have given thousands and thousands of lectures

38:36.700 --> 38:40.160
even in English language.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.320
Like for these beautiful lights

38:51.520 --> 38:56.120
we have to just switch on one switch.

39:03.460 --> 39:06.680
But if I go on telling all about electricity

39:06.880 --> 39:10.260
and how it was (told?) and how it started in Finland,

39:10.460 --> 39:13.840
you will have a headache.

39:20.820 --> 39:24.100
Better thing is to have the light!

39:27.220 --> 39:30.440
In any case,

39:30.720 --> 39:33.380
I think because I am here for one day,

39:33.580 --> 39:36.100
if you have any questions you please ask me.

39:36.300 --> 39:39.620
But they should be relatively sensible,

39:39.800 --> 39:45.480
in the sense that they should show that

39:45.800 --> 39:49.840
'we want your self-realization.'

40:03.000 --> 40:07.740
So I am not here to ask for anything.

40:11.180 --> 40:15.500
I am just going to give you your own property,

40:18.960 --> 40:22.100
your own powers.

40:26.140 --> 40:30.360
So I am not here for any votes or elections either.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.040
I am sorry I have come to Finland very late.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.040
But it's the end of the lands, so naturally

40:46.220 --> 40:50.080
it took some time for me to come here.

40:59.420 --> 41:04.760
But I must tell you that among all the Scandinavian nations you are the greatest.

41:12.340 --> 41:15.500
I mean spiritually.

41:15.720 --> 41:19.720
And don’t have any inferiority complex in your heads at all.

41:23.020 --> 41:27.040
Doesn't I know Finns very well? (Shri Mataji laughing)

41:29.880 --> 41:34.620
There humility goes up to the inferiority complex.

41:43.700 --> 41:47.700
That's going too far.

41:48.400 --> 41:52.300
You are good for everything!

41:54.840 --> 41:58.920
And specially very good for spiritual ascent!

42:03.580 --> 42:06.380
Alright. Is there a question?

42:06.580 --> 42:11.660
Q. Yes. How can you divide people? For Scandinavian people, for Finnish people, Swedish people?

42:11.860 --> 42:13.900
A. That is an incidence.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.360
Q. How can you make.. how can you make divide?

42:16.500 --> 42:20.380
A. Yes, you can also, once you get this realization, you can also.

42:20.580 --> 42:25.840
Because when you go to a nation, you see a spiritual life,

42:26.020 --> 42:30.840
how many are seeking the divine.

42:43.360 --> 42:48.100
And how do you... how do some people go deep into it

42:48.300 --> 42:51.980
and some people are very superficial.

42:54.780 --> 42:59.360
You can easily see, that say I would say Turkey,

42:59.580 --> 43:03.260
we had such a lot of sahaja yogis suddenly coming up

43:03.460 --> 43:07.620
without any difficulties, Turkey, of all the places.

43:14.580 --> 43:18.400
And they were the people who were told

43:18.600 --> 43:24.160
that they will never come to Sahaja Yoga (Turkey people), because they are islamic people.

43:28.860 --> 43:32.140
But they blossomed!

43:33.180 --> 43:36.560
Now, as you know my husband’s job is international;

43:36.680 --> 43:45.500
I met many people who are Finn, who are also Swedish and also from Denmark;

43:45.700 --> 43:51.080
but I found the Finn people have a genuine desire to know.

44:05.740 --> 44:10.940
So when I say that, I mean the more percentage of people.

44:16.560 --> 44:23.860
If I say so, Russians will be very great seekers and they will be there very soon.

44:31.700 --> 44:38.320
Imagine their (Russian) Government has accepted Sahaja Yoga officially.

44:44.400 --> 44:49.800
And also Italian Government has accepted in a very big way.

44:57.380 --> 45:01.000
And even if, I mean Indians accept it, I am not surprised

45:01.180 --> 45:04.900
because they know all about it already.

45:09.100 --> 45:14.400
So the quality of spirituality can be determined by the percentage of people

45:20.880 --> 45:24.540
and the depth of the people.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.640
It's easy to ascertain.

45:28.900 --> 45:32.500
It is easy to ascertain them.

45:38.380 --> 45:42.000
Now, let others as the questions. Alright?

45:56.520 --> 46:00.980
He says that if you have some bad habits,
like smoking tobacco,

46:01.180 --> 46:05.180
and you want to grow and try to reach the state of enlightenment,

46:05.380 --> 46:08.100
do you have to leave them before you can have it.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.060
A. You just leave them automatically. I don’t have to tell you.

46:11.240 --> 46:14.860
Once you get your realization.

46:23.300 --> 46:26.980
In England we had drug addicts, overnight they gave up.

46:27.160 --> 46:31.400
Overnight. You won't believe that (unclear).

46:37.380 --> 46:41.400
Because you get the light

46:42.540 --> 46:46.840
and you get the power.

46:51.120 --> 46:56.040
I know there is a drug problem here, I know that very well.

46:59.140 --> 47:02.060
Because you depend on it [drugs] and then suddenly

47:02.220 --> 47:07.220
you start depending on your spirit; the whole thing is finished.

47:24.140 --> 47:26.220
Q. How often?

47:26.440 --> 47:28.900
How do you practice and how often do you practice?

47:29.080 --> 47:32.280
A. You don't need. This is no question of time I mean, my child,

47:32.460 --> 47:35.800
you go beyond time.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.160
It just works.

47:42.280 --> 47:46.040
You see, it's... the Kundalini starts rising,

47:46.240 --> 47:51.960
and she starts enriching your centers by which you start

47:52.160 --> 47:57.720
feeling better and satisfied with yourself.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.380
And in most of the cases it has happened, it has happened overnight.

48:16.100 --> 48:22.480
That's why I said the quality of seeking in the West is much better than in India.

48:30.920 --> 48:37.040
Most of the people take to drugs because they are seeking.

48:44.220 --> 48:50.160
Most of the people who commit suicide, they are also seeking.

48:54.500 --> 48:58.980
They do it out of frustration.

49:00.360 --> 49:06.540
Also in sahaja yoga you will be happy to know that family life becomes beautiful.

49:12.780 --> 49:16.080
Every year we have about 75 marriages

49:16.260 --> 49:20.220
and I would say 1% will be divorced or some sort of thing;

49:20.420 --> 49:24.440
but otherwise they have got very beautiful.

49:31.520 --> 49:35.840
And also they have beautiful children,

49:38.400 --> 49:42.020
just like saints.

49:47.100 --> 49:49.020
Yes, please?

49:49.200 --> 49:54.180
Q. What's the first point about deepening and maintaining the experience,

49:54.380 --> 49:58.740
what is the first point about that, Shri Mataji?

50:09.960 --> 50:13.360
A: Yes. For that I am saying it take about a month,

50:13.560 --> 50:18.400
at the most, to see, because you yourself become knowledgeable.

50:18.600 --> 50:22.800
You yourself know, what's wrong with you.

50:34.940 --> 50:37.600
I will give you an example.

50:37.800 --> 50:41.600
There was a gentleman who came and he said, he is a realized soul,

50:41.820 --> 50:45.320
he said, “Mother my this agya chakra is catching”.

50:58.160 --> 51:03.460
That means his ego is troubling him,

51:05.900 --> 51:10.200
that means he can see his ego, separately.

51:13.020 --> 51:16.960
If you tell somebody, "You are suffering from ego", that people will hate you;

51:17.140 --> 51:21.040
anybody.

51:27.560 --> 51:32.720
But this person himself says that he has got ego.

51:38.620 --> 51:44.080
Now what do I tell him? That you just forgive,

51:44.280 --> 51:47.480
everyone.

51:52.460 --> 51:55.880
And he has those cool vibrations in his hands

51:56.060 --> 52:00.360
and he can correct it. (Shri Mataji pointing at forehead.)

52:05.880 --> 52:11.020
So you have to just know how to correct your damages, that's all.

52:14.240 --> 52:17.460
Which is of course free.

52:17.660 --> 52:21.980
The whole knowledge is absolutely free.

52:27.340 --> 52:31.860
Q. What can you say about... what can you say about wish?

52:32.040 --> 52:39.200
Is it if we have not enough... not strong enough wish

52:39.460 --> 52:43.660
to enlightenment, to self-realization.

53:02.260 --> 53:05.380
A: You see, actually this is the point one should know

53:05.560 --> 53:09.600
that we cannot force it on anyone.

53:12.740 --> 53:16.240
Then we cannot force it. That's all.

53:16.440 --> 53:20.500
Just can't force it. We are very sorry.

53:26.960 --> 53:30.220
We can't help people if they don't want to have it.

53:30.420 --> 53:33.820
It cannot be forced.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.980
No, not at all.

53:37.180 --> 53:42.020
And moreover, if you want to leave us, it's alright,

53:42.200 --> 53:46.000
very good, thank you very much.

53:52.440 --> 53:58.340
You see also in the Kingdom of God there isn’t many place, you see.

54:07.420 --> 54:15.000
Q. Is it possible to sing or make music which are same as Truth?

54:23.820 --> 54:29.620
A. Of course, music is very close to it.

54:32.500 --> 54:35.060
But first you must get your realization.

54:35.260 --> 54:38.640
Then you will have discretion to know, which is the right music

54:38.820 --> 54:41.700
and which is not.
