Now what is the suggestion?

00:16.520 --> 00:18.200
[Shri Mataji shows her right thumb]

00:18.360 --> 00:20.320

00:20.480 --> 00:23.920
I would suggest put your right hand towards me and the left hand out.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.280
Right hand towards me, and left hand out.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.800

02:43.120 --> 02:46.760

Just do it like that.

Right Vishudhi- right.

04:08.880 --> 04:15.040
[Shri Mataji massages her right wrist and blows on her thumb]

04:26.160 --> 04:31.360

04:33.680 --> 04:36.880
Left hand on your liver.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.880
Now just watch me without thinking.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.080
And forgive, forgive, forgive.

06:01.240 --> 06:05.480
Forgive every one, forgive every

Let us say once Lord’s prayer :

06:12.720 --> 06:16.600
"Our Father, who art in heaven,

06:16.800 --> 06:18.880
Hallowed be thy name.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.640
Thy Kingdom come.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.200
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.920
Give us this day our daily bread.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.040
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive

06:32.200 --> 06:34.760
those who trespass against us.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.280
And lead us not into temptation,

06:37.440 --> 06:40.040
But deliver us from evil.

06:40.240 --> 06:44.240
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory

06:44.400 --> 06:47.560
for ever and ever. Amen."

06:47.720 --> 06:49.840
May God bless you

06:59.640 --> 07:07.000
Forgive, forgive, forgive.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.640
[Shri Mataji asks for the musical program]

07:31.520 --> 07:33.760
Watch me here,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.480
put your attention to my red spot here.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.360
Ah, better.

[Sahaja Yogi to other Yogis].

"Before that, we will sing the three mantras"
