00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.960
1987-01-15 (or 14) Meditation excerpt

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.960
of a talk to Sahaja Yogis Rahuri India

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.280
Now what is the suggestion?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.200
[Shri Mataji shows her right thumb]

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.320
Every one, still.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.920
I would suggest put your right hand towards me and the left hand out.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.280
Right hand towards me, and left hand out.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.800
[Shri Mataji blows in the mike]

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.240
Did you hear that?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.960
[Shri Mataji blows in the mike]

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.720
[Shri Mataji asks to a Sahaja Yogi what he feels]

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.760
[He says he feels the right Vishudhi]

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.000
Just do it like that.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560
Right Vishudhi- right.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.040
[Shri Mataji massages her right wrist and blows on her thumb]

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.360
Why don’t you put your left hand on your liver?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.880
Left hand on your liver.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.880
Now just watch me without thinking.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.080
And forgive, forgive, forgive.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.480
Forgive every one, forgive every

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.400
Let us say once Lord’s prayer :

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.600
"Our Father, who art in heaven,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.880
Hallowed be thy name.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.640
Thy Kingdom come.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.200
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.920
Give us this day our daily bread.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.040
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.760
those who trespass against us.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.280
And lead us not into temptation,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.040
But deliver us from evil.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.240
For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.560
for ever and ever. Amen."

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.840
May God bless you

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.000
Forgive, forgive, forgive.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.640
[Shri Mataji asks for the musical program]

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.760
Watch me here,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.480
put your attention to my red spot here.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.360
Ah, better.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.200
Don’t have a harmonium?

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.440
[Sahaja Yogi to other Yogis].

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.480
"Before that, we will sing the three mantras"
