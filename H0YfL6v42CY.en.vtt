WEBVTT

00:26.802 --> 00:36.260
Today we have assembled here to do
the Kundalini Puja.

00:36.455 --> 00:41.377
Once we had done it in India long, long
time back

00:41.578 --> 00:50.991
and this is the first time we are doing
this puja here in Austria.

00:55.957 --> 01:04.194
This is the puja of the Adi Kundalini,
is the Primordial Kundalini.

01:05.126 --> 01:08.451
[Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Can you just
put it off?”]

01:08.670 --> 01:19.775
You must have seen in the hand of Athena,
who is the Primordial Mother,

01:19.976 --> 01:31.217
there is a power which is a snake
in the left hand.

01:31.418 --> 01:33.497
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: “Put it away.

01:33.698 --> 01:38.192
It’s all right, little far away if you
keep it, it’s all right.

01:38.757 --> 01:42.465
Yes, little that side it’s all right”.]

01:47.020 --> 01:58.546
And the Primordial Mother has one
of Her powers,

01:59.362 --> 02:07.740
which we can say, as the Primordial
Kundalini, is a part of Her.

02:07.940 --> 02:16.796
Of course, She's beyond that, but She
is reflected in human beings

02:18.476 --> 02:22.761
as the Kundalini.

02:23.020 --> 02:29.958
Now one has to know that to create
an incarnation,

02:30.835 --> 02:34.853
lot of work has gone into.

02:35.971 --> 02:43.691
So many things had to be envisaged.

02:43.892 --> 02:55.884
One had to have the vision that, when
a human being is created,

02:57.282 --> 03:01.931
how an incarnation can help him.

03:02.132 --> 03:09.755
At different levels, we had incarnations
on this Earth,

03:09.956 --> 03:15.699
and they were sent with a particular idea

03:15.900 --> 03:26.815
that they should achieve a particular type
of ascent in that particular time.

03:27.726 --> 03:34.028
They were all part and parcel
of the Primordial Mother

03:34.734 --> 03:44.783
And they all had a very powerful Kundalini
built within them.

03:47.389 --> 03:58.370
But the incarnation of this Kali Yuga
is very complicated.

03:59.003 --> 04:05.795
First it had to be worked out what will be
the situation

04:05.996 --> 04:10.500
in which this incarnation would be born

04:11.738 --> 04:20.297
and what sort of encounters this
incarnation would have.

04:25.026 --> 04:35.214
So, the major propelling force, you can
say,

04:35.415 --> 04:42.484
or the major work had to be done
in the incarnation

04:42.685 --> 04:50.339
to create a very strong spinal cord,

04:50.540 --> 04:58.322
so that it could bear the Primordial
Kundalini,

04:58.523 --> 05:10.874
which is responsible for doing this great
work of transformation.

05:14.596 --> 05:20.415
Now, this Kundalini, which is
the primordial one,

05:21.384 --> 05:42.407
has all the powers built-in of redemption,
of ascent.

05:48.428 --> 05:55.833
But apart from that, to be born in this
Kali Yuga,

05:57.738 --> 06:06.367
One had to know what sort of people
One has to face

06:07.436 --> 06:17.411
and then how to bring them round
to the understanding of Sahaja Yoga

06:17.612 --> 06:23.274
and to the understanding that they have
to have their ascent.

06:30.666 --> 06:46.499
So, there are many sources of energies
and knowledge which are to be used

06:46.700 --> 06:54.819
because it's a very complicated world in
which the Primordial Kundalini had to work.

06:55.020 --> 06:59.620
It was not a simple thing like people
coming to Himalayas.

06:59.821 --> 07:07.366
They were already clean people, very
desirous of getting Realization.

07:07.567 --> 07:15.740
They didn't have all kinds of inhibitions
and conditions and ego.

07:15.941 --> 07:22.545
They were completely surrendered and
after a great amount of penance,

07:22.746 --> 07:24.740
they would arrive.

07:24.948 --> 07:29.833
So to raise their Kundalini was not such
a complicated thing.

07:30.034 --> 07:38.777
So, not only that, the Primordial Kundalini
had to give ascent to people,

07:38.978 --> 07:49.953
but She had to also understand what
sort of people are there.

07:53.652 --> 07:58.143
Why don’t you take out the child?
What’s the matter?

08:01.843 --> 08:07.258
I think, open the windows, perhaps
the children are feeling hot.

08:57.628 --> 09:01.249
Normally children don’t cry unless and
until there is some problem, you see.

09:01.459 --> 09:04.379
You have to be careful.

09:10.220 --> 09:19.051
So, all the aspects of human beings on
the random movement of human beings,

09:19.252 --> 09:33.277
all their adventures and enterprises,
were to be understood by the incarnation,

09:37.736 --> 09:45.225
to communicate with the Primordial
Kundalini.

09:46.947 --> 09:51.750
And also, such a person had to be
a Mahamaya

09:51.951 --> 10:01.965
so that She or He, whatever it is, has
to behave in such a manner

10:02.166 --> 10:15.751
that nobody should feel frightened
or should feel something distant.

10:15.957 --> 10:20.699
So this Mahamaya Swarupa had to be taken.

10:23.148 --> 10:28.659
So, the Adi Shakti's work is double fold.

10:28.860 --> 10:37.643
First is to know about the present:
the way the people are,

10:37.844 --> 10:42.357
their cultures, their styles, their
conditionings, their egos, everything,

10:42.529 --> 10:45.035
how they behave.

10:45.236 --> 10:49.697
Though the Adi Shakti is unaware of all
these things because She doesn’t know -

10:49.898 --> 10:56.731
this is human adventure. She doesn't know
how far they have gone

10:57.533 --> 11:02.222
and what do they see, what do they dream,
what are their ideas.

11:02.423 --> 11:08.564
And the another work is of the Kundalini.
So She is divided into two parts.

11:08.765 --> 11:14.821
One is the Kundalini and another
is the Sahasrara.

11:15.330 --> 11:18.112
So [the] Sahasrara has to supply
all the material,

11:18.313 --> 11:28.195
all the information to the Kundalini and
then the Kundalini has to work out.

11:28.396 --> 11:33.102
Of course, as you know very well, there
are deities who are built-in

11:33.303 --> 11:37.811
everywhere in the Sahasrara also,
in the whole body,

11:38.012 --> 11:44.140
and they are the ones who communicate
whatever has to be communicated properly,

11:44.309 --> 11:49.001
but it’s a very complicated work, extremely
complicated.

11:49.202 --> 11:59.089
So this Primordial Kundalini acts for
the collective, Samashti,

11:59.290 --> 12:03.779
as well as for the individual.

12:03.980 --> 12:11.099
Now supposing you go to a place like,
say, an airport.

12:11.300 --> 12:17.244
So you start absorbing the heat
of the people.

12:17.918 --> 12:21.462
Then the perspiration starts and you have
to see

12:21.663 --> 12:27.228
that all this work is done through
your body.

12:27.429 --> 12:33.935
Or, at the same time, if there’s somebody,
individual, who has some problem,

12:34.136 --> 12:42.829
also can be absorbed and can be corrected.

12:43.030 --> 12:48.746
So, it acts on both the levels – one on
the individual and one on the collective,

12:48.947 --> 12:54.093
as they say samashti and vyashti.

12:55.099 --> 12:58.977
And simultaneously this can act.

12:59.178 --> 13:05.902
Now the attention, which is the power
of the brain,

13:06.103 --> 13:13.222
we can say, or power of Sahasrara, also
has to be

13:13.423 --> 13:24.682
extremely deep, alert and intelligible.

13:25.643 --> 13:33.127
All this work had to be done to create

13:33.765 --> 13:39.587
this incarnation of Primordial Kundalini
and the Sahasrara.

13:42.928 --> 13:55.667
So many mechanisms were used. So many
types of wiring were done, as you do it,

13:55.868 --> 14:00.819
like as you try to fix your computer
to make it the most efficient one,

14:01.020 --> 14:05.885
in the same way, a lot of work was to be
put in.

14:12.561 --> 14:22.387
And first You had to watch human beings
for two thousand years,

14:22.588 --> 14:26.508
how they have been behaving, what they
have been doing

14:26.709 --> 14:31.450
and now what sort of human beings are
there.

14:32.548 --> 14:37.443
Every nation had different conditionings.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.135
Every individual had different
conditioning.

14:40.336 --> 14:48.025
It's a very difficult work and One had
to have really the ocean of patience,

14:48.226 --> 14:52.610
inexhaustible ocean of patience.

14:52.811 --> 14:56.171
And that's how

15:00.508 --> 15:03.915
this work of Sahaja Yoga, the whole stage
was set in.

15:04.116 --> 15:10.196
As you have put the stage here, you have
done a marvellous work

15:10.397 --> 15:17.780
and it looks very nice, beautiful,
everything is there.

15:20.380 --> 15:28.897
but the stage for Sahaja Yoga was a very
complicated one, extremely complicated.

15:31.740 --> 15:37.089
Because the work was so dynamic, so subtle,

15:37.290 --> 15:47.325
at the same time so loving, so affectionate.

15:53.084 --> 16:08.499
All the intelligence of the Divine was used
to manufacture this incarnation.

16:16.275 --> 16:22.124
And to get a human Realization was also
very difficult.

16:22.325 --> 16:24.866
You had to be born like an ordinary human
being,

16:25.067 --> 16:28.456
to live in your family like an ordinary
person.

16:28.661 --> 16:34.315
You had to find out through entering
into everybody's Kundalini

16:34.516 --> 16:40.350
what was wrong with them, what
was the mistake,

16:40.551 --> 16:45.602
how you could use the permutations
and combinations

16:45.803 --> 16:50.779
of their chakras to give them en masse
Realization.

16:50.980 --> 16:58.274
It was a tremendous task and that had to be
done with the Sahasrara.

17:03.212 --> 17:05.738
But it has been achieved.

17:05.939 --> 17:20.897
All these great plans of the Divine
and everybody's detailed working

17:21.555 --> 17:32.139
and bringing everything to a par excellence
level was really tremendous.

17:32.328 --> 17:40.040
I'm Myself surprised at Myself and amazed

17:41.171 --> 17:49.253
how I could really get so many people
in Sahaja Yoga.

17:52.060 --> 17:55.008
I didn't expect it,

17:57.156 --> 18:02.025
but it has worked tremendously, because
of the cooperation of human beings also,

18:02.226 --> 18:06.186
otherwise it would not have been possible.

18:08.859 --> 18:13.707
Now when you do these pujas and
all those things,

18:13.908 --> 18:22.761
you please those deities, make them happy
because they have done so much work.

18:22.962 --> 18:29.597
Is your gratitude for them that they have
worked so hard

18:29.798 --> 18:34.699
with such diligence, with such precisions

18:34.900 --> 18:42.392
that today we have been able to achieve
this great drama of Sahaja Yoga.

18:42.836 --> 18:47.315
Those who are Sahaja Yogis perhaps
do not realize

18:47.516 --> 18:52.355
what is the great work done in
the background

18:52.556 --> 18:58.988
and how much time it took to build up
the whole thing,

18:59.189 --> 19:03.926
to bring it to this level of perfection.

19:09.987 --> 19:15.778
So the Primordial Kundalini, which
is reflected in you as your Kundalini,

19:15.979 --> 19:24.848
also is of the same nature and it works
in the same way.

19:25.049 --> 19:34.852
It rises, gives you Self Realization,
gives you the powers,

19:36.983 --> 19:43.773
but, after all, one has to know it is
a reflection.

19:45.303 --> 19:53.011
and a reflection to make it truthful, real,

19:53.720 --> 19:59.926
you have to look at reality first,

20:01.452 --> 20:08.264
how the real One, the real Kundalini,

20:08.465 --> 20:14.915
the real Primordial One, how it acts,
how it works.

20:15.116 --> 20:18.178
If you start thinking about My Kundalini
only,

20:18.379 --> 20:22.444
immediately you will become silent,
no question.

20:22.645 --> 20:27.059
You cannot think, just you'll become
silent.

20:27.260 --> 20:34.955
Just think of any one of My chakras
and your chakras will be all right.

20:35.156 --> 20:39.852
But you have to have that depth. You have
to have that much protocol.

20:40.036 --> 20:44.502
You have to have that much right.
Just it will act.

20:44.703 --> 20:49.360
Don't have to do anything. Just you have
to think of My chakras.

20:49.561 --> 20:53.949
Just think about My Kundalini. That's
sufficient.

20:54.150 --> 20:57.540
But you have to develop that surrendering
situation.

20:57.740 --> 21:01.110
Even now there are Sahaja Yogis who doubt.

21:01.287 --> 21:04.558
They have seen the work, they have seen
everything, still they doubt,

21:04.759 --> 21:09.906
and they yield to people who are
on the periphery.

21:10.107 --> 21:14.435
And there are Sahaja Yogis who [are]
still sticking on to many things.

21:14.636 --> 21:20.278
They cannot change. They haven’t got yet
that courage to change themselves.

21:20.479 --> 21:24.524
I don't say that you have to change
anything outside,

21:24.725 --> 21:30.046
but a time comes you might have to change
also, so you should be prepared.

21:30.247 --> 21:36.587
How much we are courageous, that is to be
weighed and to be found out.

21:36.788 --> 21:40.228
Unless and until you have full courage,

21:40.429 --> 21:47.378
you cannot establish Sahaja Yoga
in a quick way.

21:47.579 --> 21:51.988
When you are using your own Kundalini,
you have to know

21:52.189 --> 21:58.179
that the Kundalini that is your own has
problems.

21:58.380 --> 22:02.779
She Herself has gone through various ages
and stages

22:02.980 --> 22:06.620
and She Herself is sometimes very much
hurt,

22:06.820 --> 22:12.964
very unhappy and very weak, and then
She cannot rise.

22:13.165 --> 22:19.908
So if you want that this Kundalini that is
your own, that is your own mother

22:20.109 --> 22:23.370
has to give you all the nourishment and
everything,

22:23.571 --> 22:30.290
you must learn, first of all, foremost
thing, how to surrender to reality.

22:30.491 --> 22:36.587
So, if you learn how to surrender
to the Primordial Kundalini,

22:36.788 --> 22:40.147
then your Kundalini's immediately
strengthened.

22:40.348 --> 22:45.067
It's like this, supposing you have a stone

22:45.268 --> 22:53.802
and you try to put anything on it,
it won't reflect.

22:54.003 --> 22:59.003
Then you improve with the wood, still
nothing will be reflected.

22:59.204 --> 23:02.299
Then you paint it, some reflection will
come.

23:02.500 --> 23:06.700
Then you have the glass. The glass won't
reflect.

23:06.873 --> 23:11.113
But if you use some mercury and make it
a mirror, it will reflect,

23:11.275 --> 23:13.981
but still it may not be the perfect mirror.

23:14.182 --> 23:18.660
So this is how the kind of a reflector
you are,

23:18.821 --> 23:23.015
on that depends the kind of a reflection
you get

23:23.216 --> 23:26.931
and the kind of personality you develop.

23:27.132 --> 23:39.326
So there should be no aim as such but
to be dissolved into the reality,

23:39.527 --> 23:46.147
should be the desire within you. To start
dissolving into it.

23:46.348 --> 23:49.308
Then one does not have to talk about
detachment.

23:49.509 --> 23:53.749
One does not have to talk about anything,
about any virtues.

23:53.950 --> 23:57.644
They automatically come because now
you have become the Divine.

23:57.845 --> 24:01.698
Once you become the Divine, even your
Kundalini becomes

24:01.899 --> 24:09.258
absolutely, beautifully, completely
reflecting the Primordial One.

24:09.459 --> 24:12.336
So today I had decided to have this puja

24:12.537 --> 24:15.032
and to tell you about this Primordial
Kundalini,

24:15.233 --> 24:19.767
how it has been worked out,
it has been built in

24:19.968 --> 24:28.353
and it has been given so many powers.

24:30.756 --> 24:34.635
Formerly, before this kind of Sahaja Yoga,

24:34.836 --> 24:38.806
people had to cleanse their chakras,
cleanse their body,

24:39.007 --> 24:41.607
cleanse their mind, do all kinds of things,
tapas

24:41.808 --> 24:46.762
and then they would think of having
Realization.

24:46.963 --> 24:50.069
Even Mahavira did twelve years of tapas,

24:50.270 --> 24:53.540
while in Sahaja Yoga none of you have done
any tapas, nothing.

24:53.741 --> 24:58.646
From the very first day you have been
blessed and you have had blessings

24:58.847 --> 25:02.196
and you have been enjoying your blessings
throughout.

25:02.397 --> 25:07.380
So that is a temptation. Remember
it's a temptation.

25:07.580 --> 25:10.699
Don't get lost with the blessings that
you are having.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.620
You have to go further and further
and further.

25:13.820 --> 25:16.285
So it's not a difficult life in Sahaja
Yoga, at all.

25:16.486 --> 25:21.796
On the contrary, it’s very much easier.
But then people start using Sahaja Yoga

25:21.997 --> 25:25.065
for certain purposes which secretly they
know

25:25.266 --> 25:28.580
that they are using Sahaj Yoga for this
purpose and that purpose.

25:28.752 --> 25:34.733
If you start using Sahaj Yoga for any such
purpose, then again you have a fall,

25:34.934 --> 25:39.174
then again you have to understand that this
was a wrong thing and then again you rise.

25:39.375 --> 25:43.509
So people go like this, up and down,
up and down, up and down.

25:43.710 --> 25:48.986
But still, I must say, this Realization
that is given to you, has been given

25:49.187 --> 25:55.640
without cleansing you, without telling you
anything, without asking for anything,

25:55.854 --> 26:06.522
without any kind of bondage on you, bandhan
on you, and you got this Realisation.

26:06.723 --> 26:15.911
But now, immediately after Realization,
you are in the bondage of your Kundalini

26:16.128 --> 26:19.519
and you have to look after Her and you have
to look after yourself.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.565
Now you have to identify yourself fully
with your Kundalini

26:23.766 --> 26:26.441
and then everything works out all right.

26:26.642 --> 26:30.539
So today is the day when we have to decide

26:30.740 --> 26:37.380
that our greatest weapon as Austria
is Astra, is Kundalini

26:37.581 --> 26:43.820
and we should know how to use it,
what mantras to be used,

26:44.020 --> 26:49.485
what is the problem we have and we should
not be shy of our problem.

26:49.694 --> 26:55.387
If we have a problem, we should know
this is our problem, it must be corrected.

26:55.588 --> 26:58.761
Also, we should know the technique fully.

26:58.962 --> 27:02.837
I find that some people know lot
of techniques

27:03.038 --> 27:05.610
and also they know how to give big
speeches,

27:05.811 --> 27:11.013
but they are not good in their hearts.
Their hearts are not clean.

27:11.214 --> 27:17.780
They want to use their power of speech
just to show off their knowledge.

27:17.943 --> 27:22.502
Then there are some people who are –
who are such

27:22.670 --> 27:27.273
that they are good in vibrations and they
want to give vibrations,

27:27.474 --> 27:31.423
but they are afraid, and they don't know
much about the technique.

27:31.624 --> 27:34.951
So you have to know all these three things
properly,

27:35.152 --> 27:39.905
if you really want to achieve full results
of your ascent.

27:40.106 --> 27:43.159
And if you want really to transform
the world,

27:43.360 --> 27:47.898
then you must know you have to be ideal
people. You cannot be problematic people.

27:48.099 --> 27:53.046
Now see, yesterday I was surprised
how many people there were sick,

27:53.247 --> 27:57.312
how many people were suffering from this
or that.

27:57.513 --> 28:00.962
While you should thank your stars that none
of you have any sickness,

28:01.163 --> 28:03.783
you are perfectly all right, you don't have
bad habits,

28:03.984 --> 28:06.644
you don't have anything. You have just
come out of it.

28:06.845 --> 28:11.311
But to go further, you have to have full
determination and understanding

28:11.512 --> 28:15.403
that this is a tremendous work and
a tremendous task

28:15.604 --> 28:18.522
and all your powers to be awakened
within yourself,

28:18.723 --> 28:25.819
you have to be, first of all, fully
equipped with readiness,

28:26.020 --> 28:32.655
readiness to serve the Divine. Unless
and until you have that readiness,

28:32.856 --> 28:37.063
that, "I don't want anything. I don't want.
I just want to serve the Divine.”

28:37.264 --> 28:45.641
As long as you are striving for it and
asking for it with full heart,

28:45.842 --> 28:50.948
with full sincerity, then I’m sure this
Kundalini will be strengthened

28:51.149 --> 28:55.504
and She'll cleanse you completely and
you'll be one day Mahayogis.

28:55.705 --> 28:58.869
May God bless you all.
