WEBVTT

00:01.929 --> 00:08.589
The state of our planet, or Mother Earth,
is very precarious.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.912
On one side we see signs of great
destruction

00:12.113 --> 00:18.108
at the hands of human beings and which
are therefore our own creation.

00:18.317 --> 00:23.443
The potent idea of destruction is at work
within human beings,

00:23.644 --> 00:28.306
but it creates destructions on the outside.

00:28.507 --> 00:33.631
This destructiveness is not necessarily
deliberate,

00:33.832 --> 00:37.161
but blind and uncontrollable.

00:37.362 --> 00:43.960
It is this blindness and ignorance that
have to be enlightened.

00:44.161 --> 00:47.654
According to the ancient Puranas of India

00:47.855 --> 00:52.033
it is precisely these dark days of Kali
Yuga

00:52.240 --> 00:56.249
or modern times that are the times

00:56.450 --> 01:04.723
for en masse Self-Realization
or the Age of enlightenment.

01:04.924 --> 01:07.930
But, we still have many problems

01:08.131 --> 01:11.100
from our past or our history

01:11.301 --> 01:14.205
that have to be solved beforehand.

01:14.406 --> 01:18.752
These have a bearing on the international
situation,

01:18.953 --> 01:26.005
so first let us see which problem or
problems have to be solved.

01:26.206 --> 01:29.060
In international relations, there have been

01:29.261 --> 01:32.869
a number of fundamental problems in recent
years.

01:33.070 --> 01:36.734
In the post-World War the most important
political development

01:36.935 --> 01:41.679
has been the conflict between communism
and the democratic idea.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.089
There was a fundamental cleavage between
these forms

01:45.290 --> 01:47.517
of political thoughts and government,

01:47.718 --> 01:55.652
and this has resulted in a lot of constant
tensions between East and West.

01:55.853 --> 01:58.343
This became one of the very crucial issues

01:58.544 --> 02:01.516
of our times for the future of humanity.

02:01.717 --> 02:07.920
In recent years, however, there was a major
change initiated,

02:08.121 --> 02:11.803
first in China by Mr Deng (Deng Xianping)

02:12.004 --> 02:16.288
who began to open Chinese society
to the new ideas.

02:16.489 --> 02:19.485
But the most important change came with
the arrival

02:19.686 --> 02:24.295
of Mr Gorbachev on the world scene.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.128
When he assumed power, he obviously made

02:27.328 --> 02:31.288
a very thorough review of the situation
in his country

02:31.489 --> 02:36.216
and came to the conclusion that the old
political and economic structure,

02:36.417 --> 02:41.583
in accordance with the orthodox communist
doctrine, needed to be changed

02:41.784 --> 02:45.732
and that change had to be fundamental
in nature.

02:45.933 --> 02:49.827
So he gave to the world two new words,

02:50.028 --> 02:54.856
“perestroika” and “glasnost”,

02:55.057 --> 03:00.248
which encompass some very radical changes.

03:01.185 --> 03:10.106
Is this the beginning of the new Age in
accordance with the play of the Divine?

03:11.361 --> 03:17.546
First of all, “perestroika” really means
“restructuring”.

03:17.747 --> 03:24.436
Mr Gorbachev is engaged in a really great
endeavour

03:24.806 --> 03:31.518
in totally restructuring the Soviet
political and economic system.

03:31.719 --> 03:35.800
Accordingly, he has made breath-taking
changes

03:36.001 --> 03:39.320
within a very limited period of time.

03:39.521 --> 03:42.961
He has also opened up Soviet society

03:43.162 --> 03:50.268
by using “glasnost”, which means
“openness”.

03:50.968 --> 03:56.211
Now, the democratic world is getting far
more news of the USSR

03:56.412 --> 03:59.659
and the people of the USSR are getting
far better news

03:59.860 --> 04:05.365
about their own affairs and those of
the rest of the world.

04:05.656 --> 04:08.997
Not only that, but many more people are now

04:09.198 --> 04:13.035
visiting the USSR without any difficulties.

04:13.236 --> 04:16.458
I should mention that recently about forty
Sahaja Yogis

04:16.659 --> 04:19.995
from the west went to Russia.

04:20.196 --> 04:22.902
The invitation came out of the blue.

04:23.103 --> 04:27.775
We had a tremendous success and thousands
of people came pouring in

04:27.976 --> 04:34.466
and most of them got their Self-realization.

04:36.332 --> 04:40.656
Russia is the first country which has
recognized

04:40.857 --> 04:46.365
the unique capacity of Sahaja Yoga

04:46.566 --> 04:51.247
by granting official status

04:51.448 --> 04:56.241
of absolutely independent organization.

04:57.187 --> 05:01.865
Perhaps they have realised

05:02.066 --> 05:06.733
that it is only after Self-realization

05:06.934 --> 05:09.968
that the inner transformation process
is triggered

05:10.169 --> 05:14.964
through which ultimately you get your
enlightenment.

05:15.165 --> 05:18.078
This is our guess.

05:19.698 --> 05:22.381
But even on the spiritual level,

05:22.582 --> 05:26.015
as far as international relations are
concerned,

05:26.216 --> 05:31.029
Mr Gorbachev and his new policies

05:31.244 --> 05:37.915
have resulted in the lessening of tensions
between East and West.

05:38.116 --> 05:40.576
In fact, by a very wise approach,

05:40.777 --> 05:45.182
Mr Gorbachev has taken a number
of initiatives

05:45.383 --> 05:51.772
to demonstrate that he does not believe
in East-West conflict at all,

05:51.973 --> 05:55.363
but rather in East-West cooperation.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.627
Perhaps he believes that by reducing
pressure

05:58.828 --> 06:03.939
from the reformed Soviet side, the aim
of bringing about a better relationship

06:04.140 --> 06:09.956
between the peoples of different parts of
the world could be easily achieved,

06:10.157 --> 06:14.400
by gradually creating, in this way,
a deeper sense of security,

06:14.601 --> 06:17.729
world peace could be finally established.

06:17.930 --> 06:23.748
He has shown by his initiatives, with
regard to disarmament in particular,

06:24.014 --> 06:26.940
that he no longer wants to take a stand

06:27.149 --> 06:29.868
on the basis of a mighty military force

06:30.069 --> 06:35.015
that has been perceived over the years
as a threat to freedom in the West.

06:35.216 --> 06:38.875
He has shown remarkably his courage

06:39.076 --> 06:44.157
in the nuclear field and even in the field
of conventional forces

06:44.358 --> 06:49.590
and has continued zealous negotiations

06:49.791 --> 06:54.748
between East and West for overall
disarmament.

06:54.949 --> 06:59.004
We should now appreciate how the
apprehensions

06:59.205 --> 07:02.996
of the West are losing their substance.

07:03.197 --> 07:07.393
This is so obvious today in the views that
have been expressed

07:07.594 --> 07:12.149
by a number of countries in the Western
alliance.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.616
For example, West Germany,

07:14.817 --> 07:18.434
who was once the bitter enemy of
the Soviet Union,

07:18.635 --> 07:22.154
now feels that the changes that have
taken place in Russia

07:22.355 --> 07:27.117
are not merely cosmetic, but they are
fundamental changes.

07:27.333 --> 07:33.750
The conclusion is that the West should now
respond in a suitable way.

07:35.641 --> 07:39.671
Although some countries have not really
responded,

07:39.872 --> 07:43.490
the results are evident.

07:44.327 --> 07:47.158
Thus, East-West conflicts have now ceased

07:47.359 --> 07:51.546
to be the most fundamental point of
conflict in the world.

07:51.747 --> 07:54.624
When there is a much better understanding
between the two

07:54.825 --> 07:57.734
super powers and their allies,

07:57.935 --> 08:05.132
this naturally also has an effect on
thinking in the NATO alliance.

08:05.333 --> 08:10.437
Not that one can say that all the problems
are solved,

08:10.638 --> 08:15.566
but it is certainly not “problem number
one” any more.

08:15.767 --> 08:18.732
Then, what is the problem?

08:18.933 --> 08:23.253
The world must decide that it can do

08:23.454 --> 08:28.814
to ease the labour pains of the birth of
a democratic Russia

08:29.015 --> 08:32.621
and also decide how to tell the truth

08:32.822 --> 08:38.708
about the problems of the so-called free
world without any egotism.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.284
This is a great challenge for the honesty

08:41.485 --> 08:44.504
and devotion to peace of the Western world.

08:44.705 --> 08:48.645
This is the moment for them to formulate
a clear policy

08:48.846 --> 08:51.105
as to how to help that process,

08:51.306 --> 08:57.111
as well as diligently and wisely working
out through profound introspection,

08:57.334 --> 09:00.882
how to establish security and peace within
their own countries

09:01.083 --> 09:10.558
and to curb the self-destructive ventures
of their own people.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.542
If this policy is the right one

09:13.743 --> 09:17.761
and this process is supported in a
pragmatic and humanistic way,

09:17.962 --> 09:22.210
then very quickly these changes will be
miraculously consolidated

09:22.411 --> 09:28.704
and we will see a more humane freer society
in the communist world.

09:28.905 --> 09:32.388
I feel that the Russians need real freedom,

09:32.589 --> 09:36.173
while the West needs wise self-discipline.

09:36.374 --> 09:41.867
Thus, My vision is that these right actions
and these appropriate reactions

09:42.068 --> 09:45.262
will bear their fruit of a very beautiful
world

09:45.463 --> 09:51.732
of brotherhood and peace, which will be
worthy of its enlightenment.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.971
Crucial and dangerous problem we must face

09:56.172 --> 09:59.793
is surely that of religious fundamentalism

09:59.994 --> 10:06.655
and we cannot point the finger at any
religion in particular.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.601
Wherever you see or look you find that
the concept of religion

10:11.802 --> 10:16.089
has strayed far from the original ideas
of its founder.

10:16.290 --> 10:21.350
I have said many times before and I say
it again now,

10:21.551 --> 10:25.475
on the tree of spirituality many beautiful
flowers have appeared

10:25.676 --> 10:32.381
as seers, saints, prophets and Divine
Incarnations at different times.

10:32.582 --> 10:37.003
Those flowers were nourished by the same
sap of Divinity

10:37.204 --> 10:41.124
to manifests the fragrance of love for
the whole world.

10:41.325 --> 10:45.572
But they were plucked from the tree of life
by human beings

10:45.773 --> 10:48.898
and now these dead flowers have become

10:49.099 --> 10:55.501
so many dead religions without any
fragrance or vitality.

10:55.702 --> 11:01.008
Religion is meant to make human beings
worthy,

11:01.209 --> 11:04.875
to transform them from their state
of subjection

11:05.076 --> 11:08.600
to their original animal instincts

11:08.801 --> 11:14.805
and, after that, to wean them from their
tribal instincts,

11:15.169 --> 11:19.600
which are based on insecurity, fear and
conflict,

11:19.801 --> 11:24.223
balancing them to prepare them for their
final transformation

11:24.424 --> 11:29.142
into enlightened and complete human beings,

11:29.350 --> 11:34.367
conscious of divine laws through their
connection to God,

11:34.571 --> 11:39.298
God Almighty. This was the original
intention

11:39.499 --> 11:43.523
at the awakening of the various religions
in different parts of the world

11:43.724 --> 11:45.973
as a message of God to make human beings

11:46.174 --> 11:51.896
aware of His power of love, beauty and
bliss.

11:52.097 --> 11:55.634
Unfortunately, in the course of time,

11:55.835 --> 12:00.448
religion has become the point of the
most tremendous conflict.

12:00.657 --> 12:03.645
They preach love and blind faith,

12:03.846 --> 12:07.906
while they themselves have become money-
or power-oriented

12:08.107 --> 12:14.671
and those in the highest position of these
so-called religion and religions

12:14.872 --> 12:18.140
do not themselves know God.

12:18.341 --> 12:22.826
They have no knowledge of reality.

12:23.027 --> 12:26.395
In this way, these man-made religions
have twisted

12:26.596 --> 12:29.713
or rationalized the words of pure
scriptures.

12:29.914 --> 12:35.704
For in their pure form, all religions
are created from one universal principle:

12:35.905 --> 12:38.264
seek ye first the kingdom of heaven,

12:38.465 --> 12:42.075
that is, seek the eternal which is
unlimited

12:42.276 --> 12:44.676
and use the transitory only

12:44.877 --> 12:49.153
with a clear understanding of its
limitations.

12:49.354 --> 12:54.971
But on the contrary, in practice, man-made
religions are organized

12:55.172 --> 12:57.600
for the contempt and hatred of others

12:57.801 --> 13:01.850
on the assumption that we are the chosen
ones

13:02.051 --> 13:07.580
and yet no matter what faith they may
profess,

13:07.781 --> 13:12.497
these staunch believers are capable of
committing any number of sins.

13:12.698 --> 13:15.754
This is because they do not have
the consciousness

13:15.955 --> 13:20.040
of the guiding principle of the Spirit
which spontaneously acts

13:20.241 --> 13:23.695
in our attention, only after
Self-realisation,

13:23.896 --> 13:28.663
which leads eventually to our total
enlightenment.

13:28.898 --> 13:33.530
Then the good or higher self, controls
the lower or baser self.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.635
This, which relies within our reach,

13:36.836 --> 13:39.812
on the path of our true ascent, in this
Kali Yuga

13:40.013 --> 13:43.692
or dark Age in which we live.

13:44.262 --> 13:49.782
Now, what I have found is that instead
of uniting people,

13:49.983 --> 13:53.660
instead of making human beings good
and loving,

13:53.868 --> 14:00.406
religions actually turn people into
self-opinionated mental acrobats

14:00.607 --> 14:03.480
and fearsome defenders of faith.

14:03.681 --> 14:09.081
Of course, the truth in fact defends
everyone

14:09.282 --> 14:12.132
and is in need of no defence.

14:12.333 --> 14:17.186
In the end all one can say

14:17.387 --> 14:21.689
about man-made religions is that

14:21.890 --> 14:25.869
the tree is known by the fruit it bears.

14:26.070 --> 14:31.196
Of course, as a result, many people do not
believe in God.

14:31.407 --> 14:34.640
They do not believe in God at all. They
believe only

14:34.841 --> 14:37.077
what can be scientifically proved,

14:37.278 --> 14:39.738
what can be demonstrated to give results.

14:39.939 --> 14:44.409
But if you want to be scientific you must
keep an open mind.

14:44.610 --> 14:52.842
You must be prepared to consider the
evidence of demonstrable truths.

14:53.177 --> 14:57.329
Unless and until you have not felt the
All-pervading Power of God

14:57.530 --> 15:01.039
how can you be at all sure that He does
not exist?

15:01.240 --> 15:04.903
If you do not keep an open mind, then it is
simply the ego

15:05.104 --> 15:08.419
that is covering the pure light of your
intelligence.

15:08.620 --> 15:12.518
However, I can assure you that the time
has come

15:12.719 --> 15:15.836
to prove the existence of God

15:16.037 --> 15:18.683
by experiencing His All-pervading Power

15:18.884 --> 15:24.532
on your central nervous system, that is,
on your fingertips.

15:24.733 --> 15:28.889
And so we realize that human beings have
to be transformed

15:29.090 --> 15:32.168
and have to enter into a higher state
of awareness,

15:32.369 --> 15:34.658
through inner transformation. This has
to be

15:34.859 --> 15:39.201
the last breakthrough of our evolution,
which is a living process.

15:39.402 --> 15:45.119
The question before Me is: how make

15:45.320 --> 15:49.306
human beings seek the truth and the truth
alone,

15:49.507 --> 15:53.966
by removing the evil effects of the
conditioning

15:54.167 --> 15:59.032
of the past and of religions. This is
a very delicate task,

15:59.233 --> 16:03.977
because the human ego is so very easily
hurt.

16:04.178 --> 16:07.544
As I have discovered, no amount
of discussion

16:07.745 --> 16:10.055
or any mental process can achieve it.

16:10.256 --> 16:13.343
So, what is the answer? It is obvious;

16:13.544 --> 16:16.140
the only way is the inner transformation

16:16.341 --> 16:20.073
by the living process of evolution in
every seeker

16:20.274 --> 16:22.227
who comes for his Self-realization.

16:22.428 --> 16:25.763
This will be enough to change the world.

16:25.964 --> 16:30.075
A further important point, that needs
to be appreciated,

16:30.276 --> 16:33.648
particularly by the free world,

16:33.849 --> 16:38.998
is that when freedom is abused it can
become demonic.

16:39.199 --> 16:43.971
Because the freedom of the rational human
being can also be used

16:44.172 --> 16:47.168
to serve destructive and evil purposes,

16:47.369 --> 16:51.542
either consciously or unconsciously.

16:52.391 --> 16:56.909
In the free world, politicians are very
anxious

16:57.110 --> 17:02.708
to keep their seats glued to them,
if possible,

17:02.909 --> 17:06.042
and for that they have to please
the voters.

17:06.243 --> 17:09.641
This is why the voters are given full
freedom

17:09.842 --> 17:13.280
to run amok in their own private lives.

17:13.481 --> 17:18.787
They have freedom to drink in their beds
or in the pub

17:18.988 --> 17:23.704
from sunrise to sunset and from sunset
to sunrise, all over again.

17:23.904 --> 17:30.425
They have freedom to keep any number of
guns they like, to kill each other.

17:30.626 --> 17:36.190
They have freedom to become like primitive
people

17:36.391 --> 17:39.132
and to degenerate into a mere sex point,

17:39.333 --> 17:43.774
rather than a human being if so they
choose.

17:44.987 --> 17:49.205
They have freedom to get themselves
a heart attack

17:49.436 --> 17:53.437
from over-work or if not, then from
jogging.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.938
Freedom to insult their husbands or wives

17:56.139 --> 17:59.278
by sleeping with any Tom, Dick or Harry.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.991
They have freedom to destroy their brain
cells

18:02.192 --> 18:06.026
by listening to heavy, very heavy rock
music

18:06.227 --> 18:08.640
from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn.

18:08.841 --> 18:11.911
The media have now achieved their final
liberation

18:12.112 --> 18:17.332
from self-respect, decency, decorum and
social responsibility,

18:17.533 --> 18:21.081
and have developed the highest expertise

18:21.282 --> 18:24.160
in slinging mud at anyone they please,

18:24.361 --> 18:26.733
and in preventing truth in the service

18:26.934 --> 18:31.533
of political creeds or sensationalisation,

18:31.734 --> 18:36.191
to slander and blaspheme the Divine
without knowing

18:36.392 --> 18:40.223
or caring what sin they are committing.

18:40.978 --> 18:43.006
They have freedom to destroy creativity

18:43.207 --> 18:47.224
with negative criticism and perverted
values.

18:47.425 --> 18:53.656
So that, in order to win public acclaim in
any branch of the arts,

18:53.857 --> 19:00.105
an artist is obliged to have recourse to
something sub-human or obscene.

19:00.306 --> 19:05.224
They have freedom to burn their skin
in the summer sun

19:05.425 --> 19:08.713
and to sleep without clothes like animals
in the winter.

19:08.914 --> 19:12.827
Freedom to preach the religion of sex
or gay liberation.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.528
Freedom to get cancer or AIDS.

19:15.729 --> 19:19.698
They have freedom to take a black magic
spell

19:19.899 --> 19:23.834
and spoil their own and others’ innocence.

19:24.035 --> 19:27.056
Freedom to indulge in any habit they
choose,

19:27.257 --> 19:29.828
except so far drugs, but maybe tomorrow

19:30.029 --> 19:33.788
drugs will be made free as they are already
in Amsterdam.

19:33.989 --> 19:39.003
They are free to accumulate as much money
as they like, regardless of the means.

19:39.204 --> 19:41.913
They are free to look stupid and weird,

19:42.121 --> 19:48.656
to be the last word in idiocity, to walk
and talk in society

19:48.857 --> 19:54.434
in the most ghastly and crude manner,
without even blushing.

19:54.642 --> 20:00.282
Every woman has the freedom to attract
the looks of every man, like a prostitute,

20:00.483 --> 20:05.738
and every man is obliged to look
young forever and so never maturing

20:05.939 --> 20:09.983
and reaching the heights of wisdom.

20:11.229 --> 20:15.131
In this way, the so-called liberated or
permissive society,

20:15.332 --> 20:19.714
have reached the very limit of their
decadence and their self-destruction.

20:19.915 --> 20:25.982
So this so-called freedom has its built-in
polarity of enslavement

20:26.183 --> 20:31.362
and destruction, which manifest side
by side.

20:31.563 --> 20:35.486
And yet so often people are blind to evil

20:35.686 --> 20:38.744
and no explanation is of any avail.

20:38.945 --> 20:44.155
If you try to tell them that they are
damaging or destroying themselves,

20:44.356 --> 20:47.263
they will just say, “So what? What’s
wrong?”

20:47.464 --> 20:51.665
The slow suicide or the gradual decay

20:51.866 --> 20:56.418
is done in the name of freedom.

20:56.619 --> 20:58.664
But a free society must not mean

20:58.865 --> 21:01.957
that human beings are allowed to do what
they please

21:02.158 --> 21:05.067
regardless of whether it is evil or good.

21:05.268 --> 21:09.991
One has to be aware of the importance
of preserving goodness.

21:10.192 --> 21:16.098
So let not the free world believe that
its battle is against communism.

21:16.299 --> 21:20.405
It has a battle on its own country,

21:20.613 --> 21:24.014
on its own hands, which it has to face.

21:24.215 --> 21:30.432
If it does not recognize that it is itself
its own greatest problem,

21:30.633 --> 21:36.239
there will be terrible conflict of
destruction or survival.

21:36.440 --> 21:39.442
And it is the abuse of freedom in the West

21:39.643 --> 21:44.846
that is in My view the fundamental problem
facing the world today.

21:45.775 --> 21:49.525
I hope that the Russians will keep their
wisdom

21:49.726 --> 21:54.734
and their discretion intact and aim for
freedom to ascend

21:54.935 --> 21:58.075
and not freedom to destroy themselves

21:58.283 --> 22:02.047
as the West is doing by creating a host
of plagues,

22:02.270 --> 22:09.803
such as football hooligans and the mafias,
all in the name of freedom.

22:10.932 --> 22:17.116
If, in a free society, young people and
people of mature years

22:17.317 --> 22:21.622
can openly take to degrading ways,

22:21.823 --> 22:26.000
then there must be a fundamental disease
in that society.

22:26.201 --> 22:28.939
Therefore, at a time when the communist
countries

22:29.140 --> 22:32.414
are making a wide-ranging review of their
situation,

22:32.615 --> 22:34.935
the Western world also needs to make

22:35.136 --> 22:37.669
the same kind of fundamental review
of itself.

22:37.870 --> 22:41.483
A solution has to be found to its most
urgent problem,

22:41.684 --> 22:45.444
which is the abuse of its own freedom.

22:45.647 --> 22:49.570
A further pressing problem is that of
the environment.

22:49.771 --> 22:56.395
The very existence of human beings is now
being threatened.

22:56.596 --> 23:01.650
People have now become aware of the damage
that has been done to the environment

23:01.851 --> 23:04.762
and of the depletion of the ozone layer.

23:04.963 --> 23:07.901
Why do we still have acid rain?

23:08.102 --> 23:13.620
Why do we have often disastrous climatic
problems around the world?

23:13.821 --> 23:16.553
We have to find the answers to these
problems.

23:16.754 --> 23:20.232
It is an extraordinary thing that in the
developed world

23:20.433 --> 23:24.729
you cannot now be confident of getting
proper food to eat.

23:24.930 --> 23:29.671
Every day there is a new scare about
salmonella

23:29.872 --> 23:35.851
or a new product is put onto the banned
food list.

23:36.059 --> 23:42.217
So, now food poisoning has become a very
serious issue.

23:42.418 --> 23:45.917
What does that indicate?

23:46.736 --> 23:51.455
We have to know that this is the extreme
of industrial development,

23:51.656 --> 23:55.042
by which we have become slaves of machines.

23:55.253 --> 23:57.886
Machines are created for our own use

23:58.087 --> 24:01.401
and yet we have become the victims
of machines.

24:01.602 --> 24:04.002
We have to change the balance between
machine-made

24:04.203 --> 24:10.636
and hand-made goods and take more
to natural things.

24:10.837 --> 24:16.832
Machines create things like plastics,
which have no natural vibrations

24:17.033 --> 24:20.200
and which are actually injurious to human
beings.

24:20.401 --> 24:25.646
But how to achieve this is the problem.
How to reduce the consumption

24:25.863 --> 24:34.070
of such useless things, like plastic,
in our daily life?

24:34.271 --> 24:41.126
Another problem we have is that of
relationships between people in society.

24:41.327 --> 24:45.544
The rapport between husband and wife
or between one human being and another

24:45.768 --> 24:49.091
has become very artificial. They can
no longer relate

24:49.306 --> 24:51.768
directly and simply to each other,

24:51.969 --> 24:56.880
ut have to have something in between,
in order to have a relationship at all.

24:57.088 --> 24:59.800
Like the television or a squabble,

25:00.001 --> 25:03.048
just to make the link. There are some
people I’m told,

25:03.249 --> 25:06.012
who prefer to talk to the refrigerator,

25:06.213 --> 25:11.476
rather than their husband or their wife,
because it won’t aggress them.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.547
So much so, that in developed countries,
people’s pets

25:15.748 --> 25:18.547
have become more important than other
human beings.

25:18.748 --> 25:22.781
They have their dogs in their beds,
on their dining room tables,

25:22.982 --> 25:26.453
but they will push their babies out into
another room.

25:26.654 --> 25:33.656
They will entertain their dogs or their
cats at their own table for their birthday,

25:33.857 --> 25:38.907
while thousands of human beings cannot
find enough to eat.

25:40.125 --> 25:43.517
This is a funny sort of society that we
have developed

25:43.718 --> 25:48.308
and we can see that first of all we have
lacked maturity

25:48.509 --> 25:54.084
to understand that we are not individual
but we are part and parcel of the whole.

25:54.285 --> 25:59.587
Our freedom has not given us the chance
to mature,

25:59.838 --> 26:04.485
to also know that this world is created
by God –

26:04.686 --> 26:06.781
He did not create nations.

26:06.990 --> 26:12.016
You find very old men running after young
girls,

26:12.217 --> 26:17.672
old women running after young boys.
This is unnatural.

26:19.213 --> 26:21.651
There is a terrible increase in child abuse

26:21.852 --> 26:24.259
and the destruction of innocence going on.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.787
It is as if they cannot bear anyone to be
innocent.

26:27.988 --> 26:30.961
People cannot even grow old naturally.

26:31.163 --> 26:39.355
The other day I saw, for instance, several
octogenarian actors and actresses

26:39.556 --> 26:42.580
doing a rock and roll and shake sort
of a dance.

26:42.781 --> 26:45.728
They had no need to; they were shaking
themselves

26:45.929 --> 26:50.204
quite naturally with walking sticks
in their hands.

26:50.405 --> 26:52.962
All these things might appear funny,

26:53.163 --> 26:56.547
but they are in fact very serious and
a country which is filled

26:56.748 --> 27:02.886
with such immature, insane, sick people
will explore anything,

27:03.087 --> 27:07.777
regardless of its value for our growth
and our ascent.

27:07.978 --> 27:09.714
It is people who make society

27:09.915 --> 27:12.561
and it is the society that preserves
the country.

27:12.762 --> 27:16.765
So all these crazy things that come from
this sort of freedom

27:16.966 --> 27:19.270
have to be brought round and cured

27:19.470 --> 27:24.123
or these countries will be ruined in
no time.

27:24.324 --> 27:29.763
To My mind, there is only one solution;

27:29.964 --> 27:32.671
that is the transformation of human beings.

27:32.872 --> 27:35.892
Now this transformation is possible,

27:36.093 --> 27:39.747
here and now, and on a mass scale.

27:39.948 --> 27:43.983
I would like to show you on another
occasion how it can be done

27:44.184 --> 27:47.426
and how to work out the emancipation
of human beings,

27:47.627 --> 27:51.810
spontaneously and effortlessly and without
paying a penny for it.

27:52.011 --> 27:53.784
Let Me show you one day,

27:53.985 --> 27:58.801
how through Sahaja Yoga you can transform
yourself and change the world.
