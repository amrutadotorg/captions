00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:08.589
The state of our planet, or Mother Earth,
is very precarious.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.912
On one side we see signs of great
destruction

00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:18.108
at the hands of human beings and which
are therefore our own creation.

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:23.443
The potent idea of destruction is at work
within human beings,

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:28.306
but it creates destructions on the outside.

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:33.631
This destructiveness is not necessarily
deliberate,

00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:37.161
but blind and uncontrollable.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:43.960
It is this blindness and ignorance that
have to be enlightened.

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.654
According to the ancient Puranas of India

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:52.033
it is precisely these dark days of Kali
Yuga

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.249
or modern times that are the times

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:04.723
for en masse Self-Realization
or the Age of enlightenment.

00:01:04.924 --> 00:01:07.930
But, we still have many problems

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:11.100
from our past or our history

00:01:11.301 --> 00:01:14.205
that have to be solved beforehand.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:18.752
These have a bearing on the international
situation,

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:26.005
so first let us see which problem or
problems have to be solved.

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:29.060
In international relations, there have been

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:32.869
a number of fundamental problems in recent
years.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.734
In the post-World War the most important
political development

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:41.679
has been the conflict between communism
and the democratic idea.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.089
There was a fundamental cleavage between
these forms

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.517
of political thoughts and government,

00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:55.652
and this has resulted in a lot of constant
tensions between East and West.

00:01:55.853 --> 00:01:58.343
This became one of the very crucial issues

00:01:58.544 --> 00:02:01.516
of our times for the future of humanity.

00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:07.920
In recent years, however, there was a major
change initiated,

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:11.803
first in China by Mr Deng (Deng Xianping)

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:16.288
who began to open Chinese society
to the new ideas.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.485
But the most important change came with
the arrival

00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:24.295
of Mr Gorbachev on the world scene.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.128
When he assumed power, he obviously made

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:31.288
a very thorough review of the situation
in his country

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.216
and came to the conclusion that the old
political and economic structure,

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:41.583
in accordance with the orthodox communist
doctrine, needed to be changed

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:45.732
and that change had to be fundamental
in nature.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:49.827
So he gave to the world two new words,

00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:54.856
“perestroika” and “glasnost”,

00:02:55.057 --> 00:03:00.248
which encompass some very radical changes.

00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:10.106
Is this the beginning of the new Age in
accordance with the play of the Divine?

00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:17.546
First of all, “perestroika” really means
“restructuring”.

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:24.436
Mr Gorbachev is engaged in a really great
endeavour

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:31.518
in totally restructuring the Soviet
political and economic system.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.800
Accordingly, he has made breath-taking
changes

00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:39.320
within a very limited period of time.

00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.961
He has also opened up Soviet society

00:03:43.162 --> 00:03:50.268
by using “glasnost”, which means
“openness”.

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:56.211
Now, the democratic world is getting far
more news of the USSR

00:03:56.412 --> 00:03:59.659
and the people of the USSR are getting
far better news

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.365
about their own affairs and those of
the rest of the world.

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:08.997
Not only that, but many more people are now

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:13.035
visiting the USSR without any difficulties.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:16.458
I should mention that recently about forty
Sahaja Yogis

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.995
from the west went to Russia.

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:22.902
The invitation came out of the blue.

00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:27.775
We had a tremendous success and thousands
of people came pouring in

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:34.466
and most of them got their Self-realization.

00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:40.656
Russia is the first country which has
recognized

00:04:40.857 --> 00:04:46.365
the unique capacity of Sahaja Yoga

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:51.247
by granting official status

00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:56.241
of absolutely independent organization.

00:04:57.187 --> 00:05:01.865
Perhaps they have realised

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:06.733
that it is only after Self-realization

00:05:06.934 --> 00:05:09.968
that the inner transformation process
is triggered

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.964
through which ultimately you get your
enlightenment.

00:05:15.165 --> 00:05:18.078
This is our guess.

00:05:19.698 --> 00:05:22.381
But even on the spiritual level,

00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:26.015
as far as international relations are
concerned,

00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:31.029
Mr Gorbachev and his new policies

00:05:31.244 --> 00:05:37.915
have resulted in the lessening of tensions
between East and West.

00:05:38.116 --> 00:05:40.576
In fact, by a very wise approach,

00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:45.182
Mr Gorbachev has taken a number
of initiatives

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:51.772
to demonstrate that he does not believe
in East-West conflict at all,

00:05:51.973 --> 00:05:55.363
but rather in East-West cooperation.

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.627
Perhaps he believes that by reducing
pressure

00:05:58.828 --> 00:06:03.939
from the reformed Soviet side, the aim
of bringing about a better relationship

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.956
between the peoples of different parts of
the world could be easily achieved,

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:14.400
by gradually creating, in this way,
a deeper sense of security,

00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.729
world peace could be finally established.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.748
He has shown by his initiatives, with
regard to disarmament in particular,

00:06:24.014 --> 00:06:26.940
that he no longer wants to take a stand

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:29.868
on the basis of a mighty military force

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:35.015
that has been perceived over the years
as a threat to freedom in the West.

00:06:35.216 --> 00:06:38.875
He has shown remarkably his courage

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:44.157
in the nuclear field and even in the field
of conventional forces

00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:49.590
and has continued zealous negotiations

00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:54.748
between East and West for overall
disarmament.

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:59.004
We should now appreciate how the
apprehensions

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:02.996
of the West are losing their substance.

00:07:03.197 --> 00:07:07.393
This is so obvious today in the views that
have been expressed

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:12.149
by a number of countries in the Western
alliance.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.616
For example, West Germany,

00:07:14.817 --> 00:07:18.434
who was once the bitter enemy of
the Soviet Union,

00:07:18.635 --> 00:07:22.154
now feels that the changes that have
taken place in Russia

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:27.117
are not merely cosmetic, but they are
fundamental changes.

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:33.750
The conclusion is that the West should now
respond in a suitable way.

00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:39.671
Although some countries have not really
responded,

00:07:39.872 --> 00:07:43.490
the results are evident.

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:47.158
Thus, East-West conflicts have now ceased

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:51.546
to be the most fundamental point of
conflict in the world.

00:07:51.747 --> 00:07:54.624
When there is a much better understanding
between the two

00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:57.734
super powers and their allies,

00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:05.132
this naturally also has an effect on
thinking in the NATO alliance.

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:10.437
Not that one can say that all the problems
are solved,

00:08:10.638 --> 00:08:15.566
but it is certainly not “problem number
one” any more.

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:18.732
Then, what is the problem?

00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:23.253
The world must decide that it can do

00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:28.814
to ease the labour pains of the birth of
a democratic Russia

00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:32.621
and also decide how to tell the truth

00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:38.708
about the problems of the so-called free
world without any egotism.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.284
This is a great challenge for the honesty

00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:44.504
and devotion to peace of the Western world.

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:48.645
This is the moment for them to formulate
a clear policy

00:08:48.846 --> 00:08:51.105
as to how to help that process,

00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:57.111
as well as diligently and wisely working
out through profound introspection,

00:08:57.334 --> 00:09:00.882
how to establish security and peace within
their own countries

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:10.558
and to curb the self-destructive ventures
of their own people.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.542
If this policy is the right one

00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:17.761
and this process is supported in a
pragmatic and humanistic way,

00:09:17.962 --> 00:09:22.210
then very quickly these changes will be
miraculously consolidated

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:28.704
and we will see a more humane freer society
in the communist world.

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:32.388
I feel that the Russians need real freedom,

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:36.173
while the West needs wise self-discipline.

00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:41.867
Thus, My vision is that these right actions
and these appropriate reactions

00:09:42.068 --> 00:09:45.262
will bear their fruit of a very beautiful
world

00:09:45.463 --> 00:09:51.732
of brotherhood and peace, which will be
worthy of its enlightenment.

00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:55.971
Crucial and dangerous problem we must face

00:09:56.172 --> 00:09:59.793
is surely that of religious fundamentalism

00:09:59.994 --> 00:10:06.655
and we cannot point the finger at any
religion in particular.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:11.601
Wherever you see or look you find that
the concept of religion

00:10:11.802 --> 00:10:16.089
has strayed far from the original ideas
of its founder.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:21.350
I have said many times before and I say
it again now,

00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:25.475
on the tree of spirituality many beautiful
flowers have appeared

00:10:25.676 --> 00:10:32.381
as seers, saints, prophets and Divine
Incarnations at different times.

00:10:32.582 --> 00:10:37.003
Those flowers were nourished by the same
sap of Divinity

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:41.124
to manifests the fragrance of love for
the whole world.

00:10:41.325 --> 00:10:45.572
But they were plucked from the tree of life
by human beings

00:10:45.773 --> 00:10:48.898
and now these dead flowers have become

00:10:49.099 --> 00:10:55.501
so many dead religions without any
fragrance or vitality.

00:10:55.702 --> 00:11:01.008
Religion is meant to make human beings
worthy,

00:11:01.209 --> 00:11:04.875
to transform them from their state
of subjection

00:11:05.076 --> 00:11:08.600
to their original animal instincts

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:14.805
and, after that, to wean them from their
tribal instincts,

00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:19.600
which are based on insecurity, fear and
conflict,

00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:24.223
balancing them to prepare them for their
final transformation

00:11:24.424 --> 00:11:29.142
into enlightened and complete human beings,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.367
conscious of divine laws through their
connection to God,

00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:39.298
God Almighty. This was the original
intention

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:43.523
at the awakening of the various religions
in different parts of the world

00:11:43.724 --> 00:11:45.973
as a message of God to make human beings

00:11:46.174 --> 00:11:51.896
aware of His power of love, beauty and
bliss.

00:11:52.097 --> 00:11:55.634
Unfortunately, in the course of time,

00:11:55.835 --> 00:12:00.448
religion has become the point of the
most tremendous conflict.

00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:03.645
They preach love and blind faith,

00:12:03.846 --> 00:12:07.906
while they themselves have become money-
or power-oriented

00:12:08.107 --> 00:12:14.671
and those in the highest position of these
so-called religion and religions

00:12:14.872 --> 00:12:18.140
do not themselves know God.

00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:22.826
They have no knowledge of reality.

00:12:23.027 --> 00:12:26.395
In this way, these man-made religions
have twisted

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:29.713
or rationalized the words of pure
scriptures.

00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:35.704
For in their pure form, all religions
are created from one universal principle:

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:38.264
seek ye first the kingdom of heaven,

00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:42.075
that is, seek the eternal which is
unlimited

00:12:42.276 --> 00:12:44.676
and use the transitory only

00:12:44.877 --> 00:12:49.153
with a clear understanding of its
limitations.

00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:54.971
But on the contrary, in practice, man-made
religions are organized

00:12:55.172 --> 00:12:57.600
for the contempt and hatred of others

00:12:57.801 --> 00:13:01.850
on the assumption that we are the chosen
ones

00:13:02.051 --> 00:13:07.580
and yet no matter what faith they may
profess,

00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:12.497
these staunch believers are capable of
committing any number of sins.

00:13:12.698 --> 00:13:15.754
This is because they do not have
the consciousness

00:13:15.955 --> 00:13:20.040
of the guiding principle of the Spirit
which spontaneously acts

00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:23.695
in our attention, only after
Self-realisation,

00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:28.663
which leads eventually to our total
enlightenment.

00:13:28.898 --> 00:13:33.530
Then the good or higher self, controls
the lower or baser self.

00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.635
This, which relies within our reach,

00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:39.812
on the path of our true ascent, in this
Kali Yuga

00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:43.692
or dark Age in which we live.

00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:49.782
Now, what I have found is that instead
of uniting people,

00:13:49.983 --> 00:13:53.660
instead of making human beings good
and loving,

00:13:53.868 --> 00:14:00.406
religions actually turn people into
self-opinionated mental acrobats

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:03.480
and fearsome defenders of faith.

00:14:03.681 --> 00:14:09.081
Of course, the truth in fact defends
everyone

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:12.132
and is in need of no defence.

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:17.186
In the end all one can say

00:14:17.387 --> 00:14:21.689
about man-made religions is that

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.869
the tree is known by the fruit it bears.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:31.196
Of course, as a result, many people do not
believe in God.

00:14:31.407 --> 00:14:34.640
They do not believe in God at all. They
believe only

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:37.077
what can be scientifically proved,

00:14:37.278 --> 00:14:39.738
what can be demonstrated to give results.

00:14:39.939 --> 00:14:44.409
But if you want to be scientific you must
keep an open mind.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:52.842
You must be prepared to consider the
evidence of demonstrable truths.

00:14:53.177 --> 00:14:57.329
Unless and until you have not felt the
All-pervading Power of God

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.039
how can you be at all sure that He does
not exist?

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.903
If you do not keep an open mind, then it is
simply the ego

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:08.419
that is covering the pure light of your
intelligence.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.518
However, I can assure you that the time
has come

00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:15.836
to prove the existence of God

00:15:16.037 --> 00:15:18.683
by experiencing His All-pervading Power

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:24.532
on your central nervous system, that is,
on your fingertips.

00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:28.889
And so we realize that human beings have
to be transformed

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.168
and have to enter into a higher state
of awareness,

00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:34.658
through inner transformation. This has
to be

00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:39.201
the last breakthrough of our evolution,
which is a living process.

00:15:39.402 --> 00:15:45.119
The question before Me is: how make

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.306
human beings seek the truth and the truth
alone,

00:15:49.507 --> 00:15:53.966
by removing the evil effects of the
conditioning

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:59.032
of the past and of religions. This is
a very delicate task,

00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:03.977
because the human ego is so very easily
hurt.

00:16:04.178 --> 00:16:07.544
As I have discovered, no amount
of discussion

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:10.055
or any mental process can achieve it.

00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:13.343
So, what is the answer? It is obvious;

00:16:13.544 --> 00:16:16.140
the only way is the inner transformation

00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:20.073
by the living process of evolution in
every seeker

00:16:20.274 --> 00:16:22.227
who comes for his Self-realization.

00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:25.763
This will be enough to change the world.

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:30.075
A further important point, that needs
to be appreciated,

00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:33.648
particularly by the free world,

00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:38.998
is that when freedom is abused it can
become demonic.

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:43.971
Because the freedom of the rational human
being can also be used

00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:47.168
to serve destructive and evil purposes,

00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:51.542
either consciously or unconsciously.

00:16:52.391 --> 00:16:56.909
In the free world, politicians are very
anxious

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.708
to keep their seats glued to them,
if possible,

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:06.042
and for that they have to please
the voters.

00:17:06.243 --> 00:17:09.641
This is why the voters are given full
freedom

00:17:09.842 --> 00:17:13.280
to run amok in their own private lives.

00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:18.787
They have freedom to drink in their beds
or in the pub

00:17:18.988 --> 00:17:23.704
from sunrise to sunset and from sunset
to sunrise, all over again.

00:17:23.904 --> 00:17:30.425
They have freedom to keep any number of
guns they like, to kill each other.

00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:36.190
They have freedom to become like primitive
people

00:17:36.391 --> 00:17:39.132
and to degenerate into a mere sex point,

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:43.774
rather than a human being if so they
choose.

00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:49.205
They have freedom to get themselves
a heart attack

00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:53.437
from over-work or if not, then from
jogging.

00:17:53.638 --> 00:17:55.938
Freedom to insult their husbands or wives

00:17:56.139 --> 00:17:59.278
by sleeping with any Tom, Dick or Harry.

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:01.991
They have freedom to destroy their brain
cells

00:18:02.192 --> 00:18:06.026
by listening to heavy, very heavy rock
music

00:18:06.227 --> 00:18:08.640
from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn.

00:18:08.841 --> 00:18:11.911
The media have now achieved their final
liberation

00:18:12.112 --> 00:18:17.332
from self-respect, decency, decorum and
social responsibility,

00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:21.081
and have developed the highest expertise

00:18:21.282 --> 00:18:24.160
in slinging mud at anyone they please,

00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:26.733
and in preventing truth in the service

00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:31.533
of political creeds or sensationalisation,

00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:36.191
to slander and blaspheme the Divine
without knowing

00:18:36.392 --> 00:18:40.223
or caring what sin they are committing.

00:18:40.978 --> 00:18:43.006
They have freedom to destroy creativity

00:18:43.207 --> 00:18:47.224
with negative criticism and perverted
values.

00:18:47.425 --> 00:18:53.656
So that, in order to win public acclaim in
any branch of the arts,

00:18:53.857 --> 00:19:00.105
an artist is obliged to have recourse to
something sub-human or obscene.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:05.224
They have freedom to burn their skin
in the summer sun

00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:08.713
and to sleep without clothes like animals
in the winter.

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:12.827
Freedom to preach the religion of sex
or gay liberation.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:15.528
Freedom to get cancer or AIDS.

00:19:15.729 --> 00:19:19.698
They have freedom to take a black magic
spell

00:19:19.899 --> 00:19:23.834
and spoil their own and others’ innocence.

00:19:24.035 --> 00:19:27.056
Freedom to indulge in any habit they
choose,

00:19:27.257 --> 00:19:29.828
except so far drugs, but maybe tomorrow

00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:33.788
drugs will be made free as they are already
in Amsterdam.

00:19:33.989 --> 00:19:39.003
They are free to accumulate as much money
as they like, regardless of the means.

00:19:39.204 --> 00:19:41.913
They are free to look stupid and weird,

00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:48.656
to be the last word in idiocity, to walk
and talk in society

00:19:48.857 --> 00:19:54.434
in the most ghastly and crude manner,
without even blushing.

00:19:54.642 --> 00:20:00.282
Every woman has the freedom to attract
the looks of every man, like a prostitute,

00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:05.738
and every man is obliged to look
young forever and so never maturing

00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:09.983
and reaching the heights of wisdom.

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:15.131
In this way, the so-called liberated or
permissive society,

00:20:15.332 --> 00:20:19.714
have reached the very limit of their
decadence and their self-destruction.

00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:25.982
So this so-called freedom has its built-in
polarity of enslavement

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:31.362
and destruction, which manifest side
by side.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:35.486
And yet so often people are blind to evil

00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:38.744
and no explanation is of any avail.

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:44.155
If you try to tell them that they are
damaging or destroying themselves,

00:20:44.356 --> 00:20:47.263
they will just say, “So what? What’s
wrong?”

00:20:47.464 --> 00:20:51.665
The slow suicide or the gradual decay

00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:56.418
is done in the name of freedom.

00:20:56.619 --> 00:20:58.664
But a free society must not mean

00:20:58.865 --> 00:21:01.957
that human beings are allowed to do what
they please

00:21:02.158 --> 00:21:05.067
regardless of whether it is evil or good.

00:21:05.268 --> 00:21:09.991
One has to be aware of the importance
of preserving goodness.

00:21:10.192 --> 00:21:16.098
So let not the free world believe that
its battle is against communism.

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:20.405
It has a battle on its own country,

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:24.014
on its own hands, which it has to face.

00:21:24.215 --> 00:21:30.432
If it does not recognize that it is itself
its own greatest problem,

00:21:30.633 --> 00:21:36.239
there will be terrible conflict of
destruction or survival.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.442
And it is the abuse of freedom in the West

00:21:39.643 --> 00:21:44.846
that is in My view the fundamental problem
facing the world today.

00:21:45.775 --> 00:21:49.525
I hope that the Russians will keep their
wisdom

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:54.734
and their discretion intact and aim for
freedom to ascend

00:21:54.935 --> 00:21:58.075
and not freedom to destroy themselves

00:21:58.283 --> 00:22:02.047
as the West is doing by creating a host
of plagues,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:09.803
such as football hooligans and the mafias,
all in the name of freedom.

00:22:10.932 --> 00:22:17.116
If, in a free society, young people and
people of mature years

00:22:17.317 --> 00:22:21.622
can openly take to degrading ways,

00:22:21.823 --> 00:22:26.000
then there must be a fundamental disease
in that society.

00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:28.939
Therefore, at a time when the communist
countries

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.414
are making a wide-ranging review of their
situation,

00:22:32.615 --> 00:22:34.935
the Western world also needs to make

00:22:35.136 --> 00:22:37.669
the same kind of fundamental review
of itself.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.483
A solution has to be found to its most
urgent problem,

00:22:41.684 --> 00:22:45.444
which is the abuse of its own freedom.

00:22:45.647 --> 00:22:49.570
A further pressing problem is that of
the environment.

00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:56.395
The very existence of human beings is now
being threatened.

00:22:56.596 --> 00:23:01.650
People have now become aware of the damage
that has been done to the environment

00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:04.762
and of the depletion of the ozone layer.

00:23:04.963 --> 00:23:07.901
Why do we still have acid rain?

00:23:08.102 --> 00:23:13.620
Why do we have often disastrous climatic
problems around the world?

00:23:13.821 --> 00:23:16.553
We have to find the answers to these
problems.

00:23:16.754 --> 00:23:20.232
It is an extraordinary thing that in the
developed world

00:23:20.433 --> 00:23:24.729
you cannot now be confident of getting
proper food to eat.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.671
Every day there is a new scare about
salmonella

00:23:29.872 --> 00:23:35.851
or a new product is put onto the banned
food list.

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:42.217
So, now food poisoning has become a very
serious issue.

00:23:42.418 --> 00:23:45.917
What does that indicate?

00:23:46.736 --> 00:23:51.455
We have to know that this is the extreme
of industrial development,

00:23:51.656 --> 00:23:55.042
by which we have become slaves of machines.

00:23:55.253 --> 00:23:57.886
Machines are created for our own use

00:23:58.087 --> 00:24:01.401
and yet we have become the victims
of machines.

00:24:01.602 --> 00:24:04.002
We have to change the balance between
machine-made

00:24:04.203 --> 00:24:10.636
and hand-made goods and take more
to natural things.

00:24:10.837 --> 00:24:16.832
Machines create things like plastics,
which have no natural vibrations

00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:20.200
and which are actually injurious to human
beings.

00:24:20.401 --> 00:24:25.646
But how to achieve this is the problem.
How to reduce the consumption

00:24:25.863 --> 00:24:34.070
of such useless things, like plastic,
in our daily life?

00:24:34.271 --> 00:24:41.126
Another problem we have is that of
relationships between people in society.

00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:45.544
The rapport between husband and wife
or between one human being and another

00:24:45.768 --> 00:24:49.091
has become very artificial. They can
no longer relate

00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:51.768
directly and simply to each other,

00:24:51.969 --> 00:24:56.880
ut have to have something in between,
in order to have a relationship at all.

00:24:57.088 --> 00:24:59.800
Like the television or a squabble,

00:25:00.001 --> 00:25:03.048
just to make the link. There are some
people I’m told,

00:25:03.249 --> 00:25:06.012
who prefer to talk to the refrigerator,

00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:11.476
rather than their husband or their wife,
because it won’t aggress them.

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:15.547
So much so, that in developed countries,
people’s pets

00:25:15.748 --> 00:25:18.547
have become more important than other
human beings.

00:25:18.748 --> 00:25:22.781
They have their dogs in their beds,
on their dining room tables,

00:25:22.982 --> 00:25:26.453
but they will push their babies out into
another room.

00:25:26.654 --> 00:25:33.656
They will entertain their dogs or their
cats at their own table for their birthday,

00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:38.907
while thousands of human beings cannot
find enough to eat.

00:25:40.125 --> 00:25:43.517
This is a funny sort of society that we
have developed

00:25:43.718 --> 00:25:48.308
and we can see that first of all we have
lacked maturity

00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:54.084
to understand that we are not individual
but we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:25:54.285 --> 00:25:59.587
Our freedom has not given us the chance
to mature,

00:25:59.838 --> 00:26:04.485
to also know that this world is created
by God –

00:26:04.686 --> 00:26:06.781
He did not create nations.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:12.016
You find very old men running after young
girls,

00:26:12.217 --> 00:26:17.672
old women running after young boys.
This is unnatural.

00:26:19.213 --> 00:26:21.651
There is a terrible increase in child abuse

00:26:21.852 --> 00:26:24.259
and the destruction of innocence going on.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.787
It is as if they cannot bear anyone to be
innocent.

00:26:27.988 --> 00:26:30.961
People cannot even grow old naturally.

00:26:31.163 --> 00:26:39.355
The other day I saw, for instance, several
octogenarian actors and actresses

00:26:39.556 --> 00:26:42.580
doing a rock and roll and shake sort
of a dance.

00:26:42.781 --> 00:26:45.728
They had no need to; they were shaking
themselves

00:26:45.929 --> 00:26:50.204
quite naturally with walking sticks
in their hands.

00:26:50.405 --> 00:26:52.962
All these things might appear funny,

00:26:53.163 --> 00:26:56.547
but they are in fact very serious and
a country which is filled

00:26:56.748 --> 00:27:02.886
with such immature, insane, sick people
will explore anything,

00:27:03.087 --> 00:27:07.777
regardless of its value for our growth
and our ascent.

00:27:07.978 --> 00:27:09.714
It is people who make society

00:27:09.915 --> 00:27:12.561
and it is the society that preserves
the country.

00:27:12.762 --> 00:27:16.765
So all these crazy things that come from
this sort of freedom

00:27:16.966 --> 00:27:19.270
have to be brought round and cured

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:24.123
or these countries will be ruined in
no time.

00:27:24.324 --> 00:27:29.763
To My mind, there is only one solution;

00:27:29.964 --> 00:27:32.671
that is the transformation of human beings.

00:27:32.872 --> 00:27:35.892
Now this transformation is possible,

00:27:36.093 --> 00:27:39.747
here and now, and on a mass scale.

00:27:39.948 --> 00:27:43.983
I would like to show you on another
occasion how it can be done

00:27:44.184 --> 00:27:47.426
and how to work out the emancipation
of human beings,

00:27:47.627 --> 00:27:51.810
spontaneously and effortlessly and without
paying a penny for it.

00:27:52.011 --> 00:27:53.784
Let Me show you one day,

00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:58.801
how through Sahaja Yoga you can transform
yourself and change the world.
