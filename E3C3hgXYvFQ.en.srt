1
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:34,514
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:47,715
As it is, today, a question has been put forward before Me

3
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:55,242
that why our attention gets lost; in the modern times,

4
00:00:55,443 --> 00:01:00,015
why our attention is not towards God.

5
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:01,812
And that, in modern times,

6
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:09,680
why a human being has gone down in his quality of humanity.

7
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:15,739
These questions point out to one single fact

8
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:23,940
that our attention has been challenged by modern times.

9
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:42,915
This attention has been challenged

10
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:46,430
by all that we call modern today.

11
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:52,880
I do not say that we have to be primitive people.

12
00:01:53,081 --> 00:02:02,160
In this great country of ours, India, which was Bharatvarsh,

13
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,525
we had such a great quality of humanity,

14
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:12,486
such a great quality of administration,

15
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:20,340
quality of kings, queens; all that was not a myth.

16
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:26,160
It was a fact that we had Rama, Krishna

17
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:33,345
the benevolent king and a great diplomat of the divine force.

18
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:39,533
But today we find all these things sound like mythical

19
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:45,070
because at what level we are, we see that as the truth,

20
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,945
as the reality - but it is not.

21
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:54,050
All this is created by human beings.

22
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:59,155
How this is created, and why it has happened,

23
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:02,754
I would like to explain to you.

24
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:10,642
When our attention was created before, in a way

25
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:16,897
that we were living with very few things in this country,

26
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:26,862
everyone knew that you have to have your self-realization.

27
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:29,696
Nobody bothered their heads about

28
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:34,416
how much wealth you are going to acquire,
how many things we are going to have,

29
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:38,917
except for the kings who acquired wealth

30
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:43,084
for the betterment of the society and also

31
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:48,972
who acquired the power for the protection of the society.

32
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,125
Then we became slaves of two cultures

33
00:03:55,326 --> 00:04:00,427
One the Islamic, another the British culture,

34
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:02,028
the English culture.

35
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,753
And I think the real downfall came

36
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:07,901
when this English culture came upon us.

37
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:11,518
Because, though they were Muslims they believed in God.

38
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,127
Whatever wrong they did,

39
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:16,831
they did it in the name of God and they believed it.

40
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:20,435
But the attention was not, still, in acquiring things.

41
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,307
We say that Aurangazeb was a very bad king, no doubt.

42
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:27,101
He killed so many Hindus because he believed

43
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:29,916
that Islam is the only religion.

44
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:32,085
That was his stupidity I should say.

45
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:34,957
He was ignorant; he was so violent.

46
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,991
But he himself was an extremely frugal person.

47
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:43,157
He used to make his own caps,

48
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:45,490
sell them in the market and live on that.

49
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:51,490
And he would not touch any money of the public.

50
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,168
But then the English, when they started ruling in this country,

51
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:59,007
this language English came upon us

52
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:03,552
as not a blessing but a curse, I think.

53
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:10,050
Because the whole literature is full with ideas

54
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:14,680
which are contrary to the culture of God,

55
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,105
contrary to the culture of Christ.

56
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:21,655
They believed that Christ was born in England.

57
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:25,466
Many Christians still believe that you become a sahab

58
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,606
when you become Christians.

59
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:33,482
This culture of the English which was forced on us,

60
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:35,785
this language which was forced on us,

61
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:42,170
gave us a absolutely a different direction

62
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:45,152
which we should not have accepted.

63
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:49,480
But as it is, we were three hundred years already in the slavery,

64
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:53,332
people had to accept it blindfolded.

65
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,936
Shri Krishna has clearly said

66
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:01,744
that the awareness grows downward

67
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:08,121
while the roots are in the brain of a person;

68
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:13,800
and the awareness, which is growing downwards,

69
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:19,765
forms the tree. And this western culture is the one,

70
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:24,083
which makes you grow downwards towards materialism;

71
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:28,714
whether it is communism or it is socialism or democracy

72
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:30,331
that makes no difference.

73
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:38,016
The whole thing is that you have to attend to the material side.

74
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:43,792
So the first object of the western culture

75
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:49,164
or the western science was, first to capture the matter,

76
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:51,524
the five elements in such a way

77
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:54,351
that it can be used for the comfort of human beings,

78
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:59,125
for the physical comfort of human beings.

79
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:03,656
But as the culture is just to move forward

80
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,560
without any control over yourself,

81
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,846
like a kite flying in the air

82
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:15,318
without having any control of a finger on it,

83
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,446
the whole thing drifted into various

84
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:27,065
directions and various fields, where it got lost.

85
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:33,633
When we pay attention to something, if the attention is pure,

86
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:41,150
it will purify the matter and will come back to us as a pure attention.

87
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:44,376
But when the attention is filled with these ideas

88
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:49,349
that you have to use all the matter for your comfort,

89
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,987
then it gets lost in the matter.

90
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:55,909
It gets involved in the matter. It gets spoilt in the matter,

91
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:02,024
and then what comes back to us is the thought, “How to possess it”.

92
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:07,801
To possess the matter, to use the matter,

93
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:11,938
to sit on top of the matter was the first mistake.

94
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,461
Matter is your slave, in any case.

95
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:20,187
In any case it is your slave, and this you would have got it

96
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:22,779
without paying so much attention to it.

97
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:27,039
To think that science was discovered by scientists is egoistical.

98
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,153
Its only your ego, says that.

99
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,945
You cannot discover anything unless and until

100
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:34,489
the God’s grace is upon you.

101
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,504
It’s the God’s grace that brings forth

102
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:42,901
the exposition of His powers.

103
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:47,287
Even a person like Einstein has said that.

104
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:52,332
Even the person like Newton has said that.

105
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:57,450
Einstein has clearly said that “I was fed up and I was tired;

106
00:08:57,651 --> 00:09:00,767
I couldn’t find the theory of relativity;

107
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:05,903
I was just resting in my garden playing with soap bubbles,

108
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:09,087
and from somewhere unknown

109
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:13,189
the theory of relativity dawned upon me”.

110
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,636
But we Indians living, three hundred years

111
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:21,490
in the slavish mentality, accepted it blindfolded

112
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:25,179
without knowing how much knowledge and science we had.

113
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,179
We had aeroplanes in our country.

114
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:29,374
We had pilotless bombs in our country.

115
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:32,460
We had all kinds of things in our country.

116
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:40,723
But, why did we accept this without going into the roots

117
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:44,629
to find out how did we have these things?

118
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,031
We started doubting all that was the past in India,

119
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:50,271
and we would not go into the past of it

120
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:55,339
but we started moving downward with this western culture.

121
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,240
And that’s the downfall of our country.

122
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:02,294
That has brought all this nonsense here.

123
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:06,750
When money becomes everything, the money orientation,

124
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,497
the economics of it.

125
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:13,524
This was the country of philosophers, of the seers,

126
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:17,464
of the saints, where now today economics is dominating

127
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,463
without understanding that you cannot put this western

128
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:24,397
economics in this country at all, we cannot work it out.

129
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:28,587
This is a country of generosity.

130
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:31,289
People love to serve you, people love to do;

131
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,239
even today they like to do something for you.

132
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,719
Go to a village, even if they may not have anything with them,

133
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,946
they’ll bring some milk; make you sit there.

134
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:42,779
“Please have some milk. You have come from foreign countries,

135
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:46,139
please have it.” But in the western countries:

136
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,834
you may give them any amount of things,

137
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,693
they won’t even return one present to you.

138
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,761
Shamelessly they’ll take everything thinking

139
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:55,922
that they are the ones who should have it.

140
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,159
They have no subtleties.

141
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,362
They have no subtleties to understand generosity, they cannot.

142
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,919
They think we do it because we are slavish people.

143
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,724
Even I was surprised when the some villagers told Me

144
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:16,338
that even the animals coming from the West are stupid.

145
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,424
I said, “how?” He said, “Now take a hen from India

146
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:28,193
and take a leghorn or rooster from western countries.

147
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:32,901
If there is an attack on the little chicks,

148
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:36,634
the mother will start shouting or doing something,

149
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:40,334
screaming or doing something to call all her children

150
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,999
under her wings - if it’s an Indian hen.

151
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:44,673
But if it’s an English hen, she wouldn’t mind.

152
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,858
She would look at everything very peacefully,

153
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:52,970
stithapragya, not bothered.” Then he said,

154
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,561
“Most surprising thing is that our bullocks,

155
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:59,639
if you tell them go this way, that way, they understand.

156
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,059
But if you tell a western bullock,

157
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,025
he walks straight into the car, into the trucks;

158
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:10,044
he doesn’t know where he is walking. He has no idea.

159
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,544
You cannot leave them alone.

160
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:12,776
And if you tell them walk this way,

161
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:15,377
they will walk the other way round.”

162
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,995
So what is in this culture?

163
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:27,075
What is in this whole upbringing that makes you so gross?

164
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:31,728
The attention is on the matter and not on the spirit.

165
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:37,541
All the time the matter is trying to overpower the spirit.

166
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:42,548
Supposing there is a tree that falls off, it dies,

167
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:46,655
then you make a chair out of it. It’s a dead from the dead.

168
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:50,665
Now you sit on the chair and you become a slave of the chair.

169
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:53,391
You cannot sit on the ground.

170
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:56,162
Then you have to carry chairs with you.

171
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,781
If you start moving in a car,

172
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:05,469
you become so useless that you cannot walk with your legs.

173
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:09,132
Tomorrow you start having calculators…

174
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:10,745
you’ll be surprised, I live in London

175
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:12,733
I am amazed at the people.

176
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:17,129
Even if they have to do two plus two they want their tambaaku.

177
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,827
They want to calculate it.

178
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:21,666
For two plus two they cannot do it,

179
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,781
they have no brains left because computers have come.

180
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,690
So as a result of this machinery,

181
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:32,166
the machines that have created… We say the “machine age”

182
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,645
what an age it is - and the age of development.

183
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:41,698
Without any control if the machines have

184
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:46,904
gone up to this point, it is time that we understand

185
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:49,933
we should not go too much towards it,

186
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,753
that we become slaves of this machine.

187
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,545
The machine is like a devil.

188
00:13:55,746 --> 00:14:01,708
It requires, like a devil, all the time to eat something.

189
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:07,404
Like, you… in England it’s impossible to get fresh food.

190
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,675
You have to go to the main market to get it.

191
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:12,740
But in America, is even worse

192
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:16,623
and in most of the countries they have everything packed,

193
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:20,326
everything in a plastic bag, everything measured.

194
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,206
You go to the shop, you get this, this, this, this… nothing fresh.

195
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:28,242
There’s no taste in the food. Now they are using chemicals.

196
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:31,594
They put chemicals in the body of the animals, which they eat;

197
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:33,934
put chemicals in the foods that they eat;

198
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:38,588
put chemicals because the machine must have a quantity.

199
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,114
To have the quantity they have to do all this.

200
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,323
So what you are taking is all this chemicals.

201
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:44,461
As a result of that,

202
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,870
what you are developing is nothing else but your destruction

203
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:53,320
So all this attention outside, into the matter,

204
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:57,141
builds up your destructions gradually.

205
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:01,872
The attention gets fragmented.

206
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,570
For example, you are talking to someone…

207
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:06,007
this is a very modern stuff, I have seen many.

208
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,796
You are talking to someone and this person is looking somewhere else.

209
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:10,910
“Where are you looking?”

210
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,913
“Oh, I was looking at that picture or something.

211
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,342
I think I should buy that.”

212
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:22,230
But I am talking to you here - doesn’t go into the head. Nothing.

213
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,301
He is looking at something, or at some woman,

214
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:29,414
or at some man - which is joyless pursuit.

215
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:34,724
We have nothing to do with it and there is no alertness,

216
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:38,192
which picks up things at the right moment.

217
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,419
Then another thing a gentleman told Me,

218
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,533
whose four children are in an English school

219
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,054
and one child in an Indian school.

220
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:49,012
He says these four children don’t talk much.

221
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:52,403
They think no end of themselves and they don’t know.

222
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:58,348
You ask them how many roads there are to your house?

223
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:59,744
They wouldn’t know.

224
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:04,726
They just go like a blinkers of a horse around their heads.

225
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,205
They walk like that. They don’t know anything.

226
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,009
They don’t read newspapers;

227
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,877
they have no ideas as to what things we have.

228
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:14,804
The youngest child, who is brought up in an Indian way

229
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:17,820
and in an Indian school, has got a little parrot,

230
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:22,205
has got a little doggy, has… looks after all the cows.

231
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:27,775
He gives all the news about all the animals in the house.

232
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,960
He gives all the news about the relations.

233
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,861
He knows who are the relations, who are suffering,

234
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:36,226
what is the problem. What in the kitchen is needed?

235
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,158
He is so alert, his attention is so alert

236
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,171
because it is not fragmented.

237
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:46,072
Now with any convenience,

238
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:49,265
we want to put our children into English schools.

239
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:52,142
I tell you, you’ll have it.

240
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,418
If they don’t beat you when they grow up,

241
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,645
you shouldn’t be surprised. I’ve seen

242
00:16:56,846 --> 00:16:59,470
western children beat their parents.

243
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:02,473
They answer them back.

244
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:05,919
It was a day when the children of a good family

245
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,049
would always address their parents as sir or mother as a madam.

246
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:15,047
But today, I have seen them answering them back

247
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:17,216
saying all kinds of funny things

248
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,451
and knowing all the filth of the world,

249
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:21,586
all the filth of the world.

250
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:24,624
They know so much of filth that you are shocked;

251
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,627
you don’t know that.

252
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,752
And the whole attitude of all their medias,

253
00:17:29,953 --> 00:17:32,835
or ours also I should say, in a way,

254
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,319
is to create that attitude,

255
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,092
to put our children into that filth all the time,

256
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:39,988
take them to that filth.

257
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,387
Our people also - I see in the television, here also

258
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:47,860
they show all these horribly nude

259
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,692
funny women in the advertisement.

260
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:53,238
Because these advertisements, and the medias also,

261
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,946
work out your attention onto the gross.

262
00:17:57,158 --> 00:18:00,441
They play on your weaknesses.

263
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:04,140
That’s how they make you weak, and when you become weak,

264
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,069
weak, they become very powerful.

265
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:09,857
When the media is so powerful, you can’t do anything.

266
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:15,343
There is no purity in their hearts to do benevolence,

267
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,919
to do good to the people - as we call janahith.

268
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:22,242
That’s not in their mind at all. Somehow to make money.

269
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,643
What’s the harm in making money?

270
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:28,428
It’s surprising how people are compromising

271
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:32,410
for the sake of money. Money doesn’t give you joy.

272
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:35,027
I have to tell you it cannot give you joy.

273
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,772
Don’t run after money.

274
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:41,194
Have a integrated attitude towards money.

275
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:43,871
Money is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

276
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:47,701
and the Lakshmi is a very beautiful woman

277
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:54,261
who has got a very motherly attitude. She is the Mother.

278
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:59,222
A man who has money has to have motherly attitude.

279
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:03,207
She has got two lotuses in Her hands;

280
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,705
pink shows that She is love.

281
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,879
She expresses Her love in two of Her hands

282
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,767
which also means a lotus which is pink,

283
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:19,824
is even entertaining a thorny bhavraa, we call it

284
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:24,035
the black big beetle, which has got thorns

285
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:30,145
on its soft petals and gives it a place of rest.

286
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:32,960
How many of these rich people in this country,

287
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:37,461
and specially abroad, would entertain such an idea

288
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:41,407
of having a place for a ashrayaa,

289
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:46,711
for a support for the persons who are like a bhavraa.

290
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:57,363
Then, the other hand, which is like this, has to be daan.

291
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,009
You have to give, if you have money you must give.

292
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:02,618
How many of them know where to give money?

293
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,514
They’ll give money to places

294
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:08,178
where people will cheat them - like Rajneesh.

295
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:12,556
They’ll not give money to the poor.

296
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:16,585
They’ll not develop anything for the poor in a proper way.

297
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,837
The other day, I was surprised, I went to Poona.

298
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,548
We have there a very good thing system started

299
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:26,225
of called as JanaShanti where people give food

300
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,496
for two rupees, very good food for one, one meal,

301
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,137
very very good food, excellent food they give and sufficient

302
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:37,772
for two rupees. And they said all the, President downward,

303
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:40,801
people came here; we had to spend money on their reception.

304
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:42,681
We gave them this that, garland,

305
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:46,010
this that and everybody gave big big lectures.

306
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:51,431
And nobody is willing to even give them a place on rent.

307
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,858
No one wants them there

308
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:55,749
because they think you will go into competition

309
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:59,147
with others who are making profits and will not get votes.

310
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:02,795
So the whole system is so funny

311
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,810
that you end up at a point that

312
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,042
they want to give money because they want to have votes.

313
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:10,831
They want to win the election because they want to make money.

314
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,926
I mean, I came to this country and everybody is saying,

315
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:16,837
“What’s the matter, why can’t we get the plot?”

316
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,955
Because the person wants to eat the money;

317
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:22,012
here everybody eats the money,

318
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,714
eating the money, paishe khaato.

319
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,410
Te paishe khata, te paishe khata, te paishe khata.

320
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:31,511
Say, don’t they eat their food, or why are they eating money?

321
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:34,266
This is the trouble of this country has come because money

322
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:37,544
has become the most important thing for them.

323
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:42,117
Nothing that they think that this body, this being,

324
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:46,438
this is a collective being. This is the samoohik being.

325
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:49,737
It cannot be happy with this kind of a harm

326
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:51,352
we are doing to our society.

327
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:53,768
All those who do things like this,

328
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:57,024
their seven generations will be cursed by God.

329
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:58,491
You must understand:

330
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:01,795
those who make money at the cost of the poor people,

331
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,932
they will be cursed forever.

332
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:07,552
And one should not join such people,

333
00:22:07,753 --> 00:22:09,603
even if you have to suffer.

334
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:13,905
I know it’s very hard time, people cannot afford

335
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:17,994
to live with the earnings they have. But still, if you decide,

336
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:22,010
you can live with the satisfaction that you have done right.

337
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:25,517
When My father was…

338
00:22:28,191 --> 00:22:31,323
and My mother, both were in jail so many times.

339
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:32,300
We were eleven children.

340
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,977
We were very rich people living in huts.

341
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,487
And we didn’t have food for days together sometimes.

342
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:40,758
And we have… were used to very rich life.

343
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:44,508
They sacrificed everything for the country’s freedom.

344
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,211
Where are such people now? You can’t think of them.

345
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,399
They are legendary people.

346
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,454
Nobody wants to sacrifice anything whatsoever.

347
00:22:52,655 --> 00:22:54,493
And this is the movement;

348
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:58,311
this is a new movement of swatantra.

349
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:02,084
Swaatantrya is not yet complete; you can see it clearly.

350
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:04,676
It is not. Your freedom is not complete.

351
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,676
If your freedom has to be complete,

352
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,561
you must get your swatantra;

353
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:14,636
you must know the technique of your swa, of your spirit.

354
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:17,543
Unless and until you get this full freedom,

355
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:20,730
you are not free people. You are slaves of money.

356
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:25,685
You are slaves of powers. You are slaves of showing off.

357
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:30,748
You are slaves of everything, to Me. All kinds of bad habits.

358
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:34,566
I’ve never known so many drunkards that we find these days.

359
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:38,370
So we have become greater slaves of all the bad habits,

360
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:43,041
all the bad doings. And there is nothing

361
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:48,375
that a person in a big position can think of not doing.

362
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,526
Why it has happened to us?

363
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:57,252
Why have we all collapsed into such insipid useless people?

364
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:00,374
What has happened to our countrymen? Is this:

365
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,343
that they have not realized

366
00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:09,322
that the greatest thing is in the brain. Is the roots,

367
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:13,992
and these roots are in this country, in this Maharastra.

368
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:19,418
These roots are here. The Kundalini has to only enlighten these roots,

369
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:23,161
and we never bothered about it. We never cared for it.

370
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:27,136
We are all the time worried as to how to get more money.

371
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:29,522
So the people who are highly paid

372
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:33,201
or who are at a higher position with less pay, also maybe,

373
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:36,032
they are making money by eating that.

374
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:38,158
And the others are a sort of people

375
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:41,319
who are going on strike for everything. For what?

376
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:43,619
For money, again for money.

377
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,083
This Bombay is half finished because of strikes.

378
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:50,154
What for strikes? I asked them. You are a drunkard?

379
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,839
Yes. You drink? All right. And you smoke? Yes.

380
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,388
You eat tambaaku? Yes. You eat paan.

381
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:57,690
That means you have money.

382
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,487
Otherwise how can you afford all these things?

383
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:03,471
When you ask for more money in a strike,

384
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:06,035
better find out what sort of a man he is.

385
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:07,531
If he can drink, afford to drink,

386
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:10,325
then you need not give him any money to drink more.

387
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:12,927
Any mother who sees her son is drinking,

388
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:14,232
will never give him any money

389
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:15,924
because he will be drinking with that money.

390
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,807
What else is he going to do? What good is he going to do with that?

391
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:22,080
So what happens is that this attention,

392
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:24,734
when it starts moving towards money,

393
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:27,990
we become so blind that we do not see why,

394
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:34,381
why are we asking for money. What is the need for money?

395
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:36,265
I am not for these capitalists at all.

396
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:38,310
I know how horrid they are.

397
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:42,612
But what I’m saying that why break the machinery like this.

398
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,537
Now whatever you may do,

399
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:47,368
whatever you may tell them that finish this striking

400
00:25:47,569 --> 00:25:51,022
and enjoy yourself now, for the God sake.

401
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:55,229
We have really poor people in the villages, not in Bombay.

402
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,028
In Bombay we don’t have poor people.

403
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:59,596
They can go to cinema; they can do all kinds of things.

404
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:03,294
How can they be poor? But they have time.

405
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,268
They have more time. That’s why they get…

406
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:06,362
enter into such things.

407
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:10,635
And they are going to finish this Mumbai of yours

408
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,938
very soon if you allow these people to go on strike.

409
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,467
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity

410
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:19,834
and it come from the western people - it’s not from Gandhiji.

411
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:23,960
Gandhiji didn’t tell you to fight for money. Did he?

412
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:26,792
He asked you to fight for swaatantrya.

413
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,692
And today if he was living,

414
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:32,192
he would have talked about Sahaja Yoga, I am sure of that.

415
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:35,661
But the problem that exists with us is that

416
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:40,752
we don’t want to see that this machinery is now shaking.

417
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:42,846
We have to have another system,

418
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,009
a parallel system that will crush this stupid machinery,

419
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,139
which is taking us downward and downward and downward.

420
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,373
A girl must have ten types of sarees,

421
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:57,535
ten types of clothes she must wear, like a Kashmiri girl;

422
00:26:57,736 --> 00:26:59,027
she must wear like a Punjabi girl;

423
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:01,066
she must wear like an English girl.

424
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,644
What is the need? I mean, we used to have…

425
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:05,574
we are rich people, I should… very rich,

426
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:06,860
we used to have only two sarees.

427
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:08,871
And one for - thevni as they call it -

428
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:12,146
one for some special occasions. And we lived well,

429
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:15,511
we educated well where attention was learning

430
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,370
and attention was towards God.

431
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,672
But the attention, when it gets lost it fritters away.

432
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:25,560
It gets lost. It gets fragmented.

433
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:28,151
There’s no continuity in it. It fritters away

434
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,794
and a person becomes a superficial person,

435
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:34,893
extremely superficial. He cannot go deep.

436
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:39,748
How can he feel his spirit? The superficiality makes you,

437
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:45,446
absolutely, a person who has sort of a crust

438
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:51,433
and nothing inside, absolutely what we call the hollowness,

439
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:56,134
kokhlapan, completely hollow. If you just break that man,

440
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:58,621
you find out he is not a man of character.

441
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:00,805
He is not a man to be dependant upon.

442
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:03,110
He is not a man who talks good of others.

443
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:06,876
He will try to pull you down. This is what happens to your attention

444
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:14,237
and you become extremely, extremely low-level human being.

445
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:17,797
You’ll be surprised I went to four villages before coming here

446
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:23,087
and the people who were there were five times more than Bombay people.

447
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,620
They came, they didn’t have cars, nothing;

448
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:30,833
they didn’t have buses. They came walking. They came on bullock carts.

449
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:35,508
And such a big crowd and all of them got realization

450
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:39,309
because, thank God, they don’t know English language.

451
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:45,177
And these nonsensical ideas that we have got from the western culture.

452
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:49,458
We are not to compete with them. They have to compete with us.

453
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,904
They have nothing to offer you.

454
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:55,748
You have to stick onto your ideal. But instead of that,

455
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:57,417
we have learnt all the bad things,

456
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:00,221
and all the bad traditions like taking dowry,

457
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:03,983
torturing our women and doing all these things,

458
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:08,131
which do not at all look civil.

459
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:12,335
In that we are not modern. In that we are not modern;

460
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,032
in that we are very very primitive.

461
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:19,664
But it was never so before. Nobody used to torture wives.

462
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:22,875
We never knew there was a dowry system in India.

463
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:24,057
Nobody knew it.

464
00:29:24,258 --> 00:29:26,617
It is absolutely something we cannot understand

465
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:30,414
from where it came, and I discovered it came from the English only.

466
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:34,176
Because they said we should be very,

467
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:38,106
very balanced about our children.

468
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:41,895
And we should not give only the money to the boy.

469
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:44,588
They’ll just quarrel but we should give it to the girl also.

470
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:48,283
Because, you see, the whole inheritance will go to the boys,

471
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:50,923
the land will go to the boys, you must give some money.

472
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,334
That was sensible but we have gone to the extremes now,

473
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:57,233
and all these problems are coming before us,

474
00:29:57,434 --> 00:30:00,376
which we call as social problems.

475
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:01,939
Then we have problems,

476
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,623
which we call as emotional problems out of family problems.

477
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:09,717
Now if you want to follow them

478
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:11,503
then I would like to give you the picture

479
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:13,566
how their family lives are.

480
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:16,990
So that you’ll understand that you just stop

481
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:20,227
having all those ideas into your heads.

482
00:30:20,477 --> 00:30:23,878
The family picture is like this:

483
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,144
That a husband and wife get married, so called.

484
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:34,341
Within say a year or so, they are divorced.

485
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:40,046
Then in one lifetime they’ll have eight husbands and eight wives, at least.

486
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,101
Then they all land up in the orphanage in old age.

487
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:46,155
The children are in the orphanage.

488
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,542
The father is in the orphanage and the mother is also in the orphanage.

489
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:54,149
All the mothers, fathers, everybody ends up in orphanage.

490
00:30:54,415 --> 00:31:01,307
There is no love. There is no feeling in England itself,

491
00:31:01,508 --> 00:31:05,015
I was feeling, but it is only in London.

492
00:31:05,305 --> 00:31:09,058
Two children are killed by their parents.

493
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:12,769
There’s no compassion. There’s no daya.

494
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,314
There’s no karuna in them.

495
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:17,722
And that’s what today happening to us also.

496
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,720
Our children are going the same way.

497
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,378
Our parents are going the same way.

498
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:26,439
So as My mother always used to say, “lakshya kuthe?”

499
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,936
where’s your attention? Where is your attention?

500
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:33,249
So you would say that no, my attention is nowhere.

501
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:35,733
Nowhere means what? Should be on God.

502
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,235
Where is your attention? Should be on God.

503
00:31:40,436 --> 00:31:43,149
Devaa kade lakshya thevaa. Keep attention towards God.

504
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,161
Where is your attention?

505
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,326
Even when they taught music they used to say,

506
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:52,368
“first think of God.” Anything they did, think of God.

507
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:54,368
When you think of God,

508
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:59,571
you don’t think of other nonsensical things but sensible things.

509
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:02,581
And that is how our… our attention frittered away

510
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:04,713
because when the attention comes out

511
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:14,226
it attacks the modern, because there’s a challenge.

512
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:18,258
As a result of that fight the attention breaks into fragments.

513
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,281
There is no... Fragmentation is there.

514
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,742
Your attention is not collected.

515
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:23,748
You don’t know where you are, where you are moving.

516
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:25,648
You can’t see anything; you don’t understand.

517
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,639
You ask them one question, they don’t know.

518
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,419
They’ve forgotten. What is your father’s name?

519
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,393
“No, I don’t know what’s my father’s name”.

520
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:38,638
This is the situation, which they are facing.

521
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:44,198
You have no idea as to what hell they are living into.

522
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,622
And if you want to take yourself and your children to that hell, follow them.

523
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,278
But it doesn’t mean that you go to these bhajjis

524
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:56,906
and give them money, or go to these horrible gurus.

525
00:32:57,107 --> 00:33:01,750
It doesn’t mean that either. It never means that.

526
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:03,125
You avoid that nonsense

527
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:05,880
because your parents were stupid to go to these gurus.

528
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:08,458
These have started only hundred years back.

529
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,013
We have never known such people.

530
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:11,614
Before, these bhondoos we never knew.

531
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:14,482
Hundred years back nobody talks except for Nanaka,

532
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,998
who has said it that these bhondoos must be avoided.

533
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:19,498
“Sadguru che lakshan he” and all these things

534
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:23,826
have been written by Ramdaasa. But who reads Ramdaas?

535
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:26,271
Because he was a Brahmin, non-Brahmins won’t read.

536
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,628
Who will read Tukharaama? Because he was a non-Brahmin,

537
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:33,693
Brahmins won’t read it. If their caste is such a big thing,

538
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:37,647
that by reading something it falls off, better give it up.

539
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:39,514
All these caste systems

540
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:42,970
and all these are now so much settled into our heads.

541
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:45,640
So much settled; it was never so before.

542
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,330
It’s very surprising.

543
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,397
And in the early times there was no caste system.

544
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,127
There was a caste system according to your karmas,

545
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:58,084
according to your doings, not according to where you are born.

546
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:02,440
Otherwise, how could Valmiki be called a brahma rishi?

547
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:06,798
And how could Vyasa, who was an illegitimate child

548
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:12,066
of a fisherwoman, could be called as the greatest of greatest?

549
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:17,998
All these false ideas have to fall out,

550
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,722
and for that we have to start a new system.

551
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:24,217
And a new system has to come forward through the people

552
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,928
who have achieved their yoga.

553
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:29,225
Shri Krishna Himself has clearly said,

554
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:32,339
“yogakshema vahamyaham” - when you get your yoga,

555
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,780
you will get kshema. Always He has said about yogis.

556
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:39,290
He has used the word yogis for that.

557
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,243
These yogis have to come that,

558
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,110
and as you have read in the Pasaydaan just now

559
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:47,545
you have heard about it that the forests,

560
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:54,493
forests of these great people who are kalpatarus,

561
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:59,126
who are the givers of your desires, will be walking.

562
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:01,874
These are the yogis.

563
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:07,194
And the oceans of this talking nectar

564
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:13,699
will be talking about God. These are the yogis.

565
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,189
Others are all ordinary useless people,

566
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,944
will be frittered away.

567
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:21,219
Only the yogis will be respected in the kingdom of God.

568
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,288
And we have to bring the kingdom of God on this earth.

569
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:29,302
First in India, then everywhere. Here it is going to come.

570
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:35,612
Now people might say Marxism, this ism, that ism.

571
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:43,222
Tukaraama has said ava ghaachi samsaara sukha cha kari.

572
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:46,508
He said it. Same - Marx says the same.

573
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,927
He says that the whole world should be so…

574
00:35:49,123 --> 00:35:52,305
such a happy place, such a happy place

575
00:35:52,506 --> 00:35:56,306
that there should be no state.

576
00:35:56,714 --> 00:36:01,693
How? Nobody asked him how. He talks of evolution. How?

577
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:04,593
How the evolution is going to take place? Ask him.

578
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,327
Ask all these communists.

579
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:09,054
They are not becoming better people. Are they?

580
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:10,873
Who is becoming better?

581
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,421
Who is getting transformed by that Isms? None of them.

582
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,585
Somebody is a disciple of this gentleman.

583
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,359
Somebody is a disciple of that gentleman.

584
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:21,625
Somebody is following this kind of a political theory.

585
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,568
Another following that kind of a theory. It’s a theory.

586
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:28,161
In Marathi as they say, “bhola cha tsa baata bhola chi tsa kari”.

587
00:36:28,414 --> 00:36:29,458
Whatever theories you have,

588
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:30,994
you have written down on your heads.

589
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:34,935
Are you going to get transformation with that?

590
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:38,073
There has to, something, happen within you.

591
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:41,911
If you have to get to that point what Marx has said,

592
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,271
what Tukaraama has said.

593
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:48,568
This parivarthan, this change, this transformation has to take place

594
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:52,662
and that’s only possible through the Kundalini awakening.

595
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:55,146
There are people who have read about Kundalini.

596
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,365
They come and ask Me,

597
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:58,857
“Mother this Kundalini that You are talking about,

598
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:01,045
people say that this Kundalini can give us madness, this that.”

599
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:05,592
Even they have said that six,

600
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:09,199
sixth chapter of Gynaneshwari should not be read at all

601
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:11,394
7because it deals with Kundalini.

602
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,445
Naturally - because they don’t know anything about it.

603
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,625
So it is better not to deal with it.

604
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:20,846
But Kundalini is the shuddha iccha, is the real icchaa,

605
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,985
is the one that is going to give you

606
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:25,935
that what you are born for, is going to give you.

607
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:30,618
After that you do not want anything else.

608
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:33,924
It’s not like the economics that you want today this,

609
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:38,041
tomorrow that and it is never satiable in general.

610
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:41,197
It gets completely…

611
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:47,551
the thing that you want is the entire source of satisfaction.

612
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:50,317
But is the movement is upward;

613
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:54,082
the Kundalini doesn’t go downward towards the gravity,

614
00:37:54,294 --> 00:37:56,778
towards the matter.

615
00:37:57,864 --> 00:38:04,679
It comes up. It moves upward and pierces through this

616
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,905
fontanelle bone area and you get your self-realization.

617
00:38:09,106 --> 00:38:11,882
This is what you should ask from any guru.

618
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,973
All the rest of it is useless. How can you pay for it?

619
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:18,327
Can you show rupee to that Kundalini?

620
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:21,874
It’s a living process of the living evolution,

621
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:23,075
which has to take place.

622
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:26,863
You have to achieve the epitome of your life by this.

623
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:28,421
How are you going to do it?

624
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:31,668
Are you going to do it by standing on your head?

625
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:34,346
Any living process like a sprouting of a seed,

626
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:37,455
how do you do it? You put the seed in the Mother Earth.

627
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:41,190
And She has the power and She just sprouts it.

628
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:44,351
In the same way it has to happen that it should sprout.

629
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:49,205
In that same manner it should sprout spontaneously.

630
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:52,473
Sahaj. Saha – with, ja - born.

631
00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:58,134
This is born with you. To get this yoga is your birthright.

632
00:38:58,346 --> 00:39:01,832
Get it, and for Indians it’s a special blessing

633
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:04,935
that they get it very fast. Just like their independence,

634
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:08,136
without any effort. Without much struggle, I should say.

635
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,425
Others have struggled much more than us.

636
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:15,349
When you get that you also loose it very fast.

637
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:20,541
So those people who understand Kundalini

638
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:23,351
understand the essence of everything

639
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:28,721
and they understand that all the religions are on one essence.

640
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:32,200
They are the flowers of the same tree.

641
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:34,344
Stupidly we are fighting here.

642
00:39:34,545 --> 00:39:41,161
Christ has said those who are not against us are with us.

643
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:43,809
Who are those? Christians don’t want to find out.

644
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,931
Now they are after Christ’s life.

645
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:49,558
Hindus don’t want to know about it.

646
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:53,093
There is no greatness of art. I would say now,

647
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:58,590
there was a problem in Aurangabad and the people attacked.

648
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:00,598
They should not have attacked. All right.

649
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,437
But we have to understand what has happened in this one,

650
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:08,437
where we have gone wrong. We should see our mistake.

651
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:12,012
In a masjid, whatever it is, it’s a God place.

652
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:15,910
It’s a God’s place, and in a masjid if they are meditating,

653
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:19,516
you should not make noise. If you are insulting that,

654
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,537
you are insulting Vittala Himself.

655
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:26,602
In the Vittala mandir you have a different type of aarti,

656
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:30,449
all right, have it. In that aarti if somebody starts

657
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,910
doing discotheque dance, how will you like it?

658
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:40,774
In the same way if that is a place of ibaadat,

659
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:44,412
is a place where people are praying in a dhyana.

660
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:47,706
Just now we are so quiet, we are sitting in the

661
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:54,456
surrounding horrible noises, but everything is quiet.

662
00:40:54,657 --> 00:40:56,105
That’s why we are enjoying.

663
00:40:56,306 --> 00:41:00,458
And if that is the way they want to meditate,

664
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,670
must we go and disturb them

665
00:41:02,873 --> 00:41:05,896
for something that some boys are troubling and all that?

666
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:09,002
Can’t we respect it? To show our greatness,

667
00:41:09,194 --> 00:41:12,349
khorpana, must we do that?

668
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,042
Is it very important that at that time

669
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:20,149
we should take these besura, betaala bands in front of that?

670
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:28,122
Why don’t we see that we also must respect

671
00:41:28,323 --> 00:41:30,833
whatever is God, everywhere?

672
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:32,650
This is the mistake we commit.

673
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:36,189
In the name of religion we insult God Himself.

674
00:41:36,398 --> 00:41:39,064
When they say “Allah-O-Akbar”, they mean Virat,

675
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,772
means Shri Krishna Itself. If you come to Sahaja yoga,

676
00:41:41,945 --> 00:41:43,952
you will know that they are all related to each other.

677
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:47,548
That Mohammed Sahib was nothing (but) a maha medha.

678
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:52,804
He was the Dattatreya Himself. This is the medha,

679
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:55,606
and He is settled down there.

680
00:41:55,872 --> 00:41:58,911
I know He was given poison and He was tortured.

681
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:02,586
And the same thing - when we do it by saying

682
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:05,130
that Mohammed was wrong. He was not wrong.

683
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:07,586
Who was wrong? Are the Muslims. Who was wrong?

684
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:10,185
Is the Hindus. Who was wrong? Are the Christians.

685
00:42:10,386 --> 00:42:12,380
They are all against all these prophets,

686
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:16,703
all these great incarnations and bringing bad name to them.

687
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:22,068
Let us start understanding. Let us start respecting.

688
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:26,307
Let us be great. Let us be noble.

689
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:30,783
Let us be higher people of affection,

690
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:34,127
compassion and understanding. Let us be those people.

691
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,292
Let us start. Let us start a nucleus like that.

692
00:42:37,493 --> 00:42:39,072
If you can do it, we can

693
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:42,715
make all those who have gone down also

694
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:45,425
pull back all of them upward.

695
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,788
It was built in this country - this system.

696
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:53,244
Whole thing was built in this country that we should ascend.

697
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,632
Very beautifully done longtime back

698
00:42:55,828 --> 00:43:00,189
but was lost in the deluge of modern life.

699
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,051
So people should take to all the traditional things,

700
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:06,715
which are beautiful, all the traditional games

701
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:12,421
that are beautiful, all the traditions that give respect.

702
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:14,300
If you loose the sense of respect,

703
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:18,563
you have lost the humanity, absolutely hundred percent.

704
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,454
If you do not know how to respect,

705
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:23,339
you are not an Indian at all. You are not an Indian.

706
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:28,459
Don’t call yourself an Indian. You must learn how to respect.

707
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,489
Respect gives you greatness. It makes you humble

708
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:37,637
like Tukharaama said,

709
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:43,085
“anurenu uni thodkaa, tukha aakaashaye vadaa”.

710
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:45,335
When he becomes smaller than anurenu

711
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:48,689
then he becomes aakaashaye vadaa.

712
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,439
In the vadaat tree the seed is so very small,

713
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:54,931
if you see that, it’s a extremely small

714
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:57,338
and the biggest tree it creates.

715
00:43:57,908 --> 00:44:02,175
Once Shastriji said that even the small thing can do great job.

716
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,537
And that’s what we are seeing. That a small thing,

717
00:44:05,738 --> 00:44:07,683
only when you become humble,

718
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,738
then the grace of God surrounds your humility,

719
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,687
surrounds your personality. And you become

720
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:18,844
really a personality that has authority of God.

721
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:22,740
That is the greatness of God - in that humility it works,

722
00:44:22,936 --> 00:44:24,180
it just works.

723
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:28,001
After realization, the attention becomes enlightened.

724
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:31,482
By that attention, looking at people

725
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:33,011
you can raise their Kundalini.

726
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,071
Only looking at people you can cure them.

727
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,110
All your powers are expressed in your attention

728
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:42,488
and you don’t get lost in the matter.

729
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,532
Then you become the Baadshah.

730
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:49,417
Baadshah is a person who doesn’t mind anything;

731
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:51,339
he doesn’t need anything.

732
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,011
As you know, I am born in a rich family and

733
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:59,662
My in-laws are also rich. My husband is rich and all that,

734
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,347
but I can live there, I can sleep there.

735
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,870
I have lived in the jungles. I have lived along the rivers.

736
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:08,847
I have no problem because - why do I want anything?

737
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:11,387
Nothing can dominate Me. You can sleep on the stones.

738
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:12,611
You can do what you like.

739
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:15,892
But that’s only possible when you become the yogi.

740
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:17,892
When you become the yogi, you can do it.

741
00:45:18,057 --> 00:45:20,259
These four hundred people, who have come from abroad,

742
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,798
come from very rich families, very good families.

743
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:25,403
And they have got all the comforts that you can think of,

744
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:30,093
but they want to live under the sky, near the river.

745
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:34,007
They just don’t want to see the cement on top of their heads.

746
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:38,247
They are so much, now, in the higher level

747
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:40,971
that they don’t want to see anything that is gross.

748
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:44,312
They want this mud.

749
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:49,627
They want this beautiful clay of this country.

750
00:45:49,828 --> 00:45:54,080
Kya deshachi maati bokha lagait. Tithe baslaat tumhi.

751
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:58,055
You are sitting on top of that; and what are you doing?

752
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:05,200
Your attention, where is it? Where is your attention?

753
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:08,994
You must keep your attention to God;

754
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,434
and once that is there, you’ll become a yogi.

755
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:15,286
And once you become the yogi,

756
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:22,158
you will be in the realm of God, in the kingdom of heaven.

757
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:24,151
When you’ll be blessed with everything

758
00:46:24,352 --> 00:46:26,625
you don’t have to desire. It will just before,

759
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:31,133
you will not know how to contain all that God has given you,

760
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:33,810
the kshema that He gives you. Apart from that,

761
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,375
your attention itself will be such a powerful

762
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:42,293
instrument that you can change the entire universe with that.

763
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:45,426
Why I beg of you? - Because you are Indians.

764
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,550
You are born in this country because of poorva sukrutaas,

765
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:51,510
because what you have done in last life.

766
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:54,574
That’s why you are born in this great country.

767
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:58,660
But it’s like those who have teeth don’t have the chanas to eat,

768
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:02,251
and those who don’t have teeth have got the chanas.

769
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,319
It’s like that. The situation is very bad.

770
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,967
You are the ones who can become the greatest yogis,

771
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:10,300
but you do not. But the western people

772
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:14,110
who do not have any idea about holiness,

773
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:17,766
about auspiciousness, nothing they are so ignorant

774
00:47:17,978 --> 00:47:21,925
they shoot off much faster than you can.

775
00:47:22,149 --> 00:47:25,287
So I have to make a humble request to you that

776
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:32,376
do not get enamored by this attention that goes to any matter.

777
00:47:32,577 --> 00:47:36,387
But matter itself is made by God.

778
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:41,106
So despite the fact human beings got involved

779
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,377
into the material advancement,

780
00:47:43,755 --> 00:47:47,254
it is today helping us in Sahaja yoga in a very great way.

781
00:47:47,435 --> 00:47:51,850
For example, this mic is important,

782
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:54,350
is also useful for carrying My vibrations.

783
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:59,334
It carries vibrations. Camera shows all the light around Me

784
00:47:59,535 --> 00:48:02,484
and shows all the kinds of forms I have.

785
00:48:02,685 --> 00:48:05,265
So whatever you may try,

786
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,981
the Divine will sparkle through that matter also

787
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:13,247
and will establish the existence of Divinity.

788
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:18,382
But if you cut out the Divinity out of the matter,

789
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:22,524
you will be hit hard and you’ll be submerged

790
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,914
in the greater ocean of ignorance and filth.

791
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:32,301
So keep Divinity at your heart and then deal with matter.

792
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:36,361
And then you will understand what is the use of this matter,

793
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,577
and what one has to do with it.

794
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:42,862
Tomorrow, in Hindi, I will be talking about the rest of it

795
00:48:43,063 --> 00:48:50,870
about the truth because today I’ve talked about the Chit.

796
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,823
Tomorrow I’ll be talking about the truth.

797
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:56,810
Sat-Chit-Anand. And third day I’ll be talking

798
00:48:57,011 --> 00:48:59,813
about Anand to you in Marathi language.

799
00:49:00,032 --> 00:49:06,128
I hope you will sit down and meditate on what I have said.

800
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:09,674
I do not want to condemn any culture as such.

801
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:13,160
But I want to protect you from what has happened

802
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:16,257
to that culture and where it has gone,

803
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:21,510
to bring you back to your own great culture,

804
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:24,222
which came to us in thousands of years.

805
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:27,701
Their culture is very, very, very new,

806
00:49:27,902 --> 00:49:29,848
it’s very new and one day they will also have

807
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:31,982
the same culture as we have.

808
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:34,752
But why not we short circuit it

809
00:49:35,026 --> 00:49:38,309
and adjust ourselves to this great culture,

810
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:46,322
which is so much God oriented, not money oriented,

811
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:50,357
ego oriented but God oriented?

812
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:56,834
Let us all attain that state of yogi.

813
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,506
I hope today it will happen to all of you

814
00:49:59,694 --> 00:50:02,423
and that you’ll all get your realization.

815
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,186
May God bless you.
