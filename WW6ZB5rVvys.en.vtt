00:04.417 --> 00:08.680
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

00:09.055 --> 00:14.721
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

00:15.021 --> 00:18.521
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.251
We all have heard about His birth

00:27.209 --> 00:31.084
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

00:31.292 --> 00:37.709
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

00:40.209 --> 00:43.584
And then it was predicted

00:44.000 --> 00:47.875
that a child will be born in your family

00:48.501 --> 00:53.501
who will be either a great saint

00:54.251 --> 00:57.875
or a very great King,

00:58.084 --> 01:01.875
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

01:02.292 --> 01:06.459
is the ruler of the whole world.

01:09.292 --> 01:11.917
So the father got worried,

01:12.959 --> 01:19.959
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

01:20.668 --> 01:22.459
into material life

01:24.000 --> 01:27.459
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

01:27.709 --> 01:32.209
So he built a very special place for Him,

01:32.417 --> 01:35.125
a beautiful palace to live in.

01:36.125 --> 01:44.084
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

01:44.584 --> 01:46.709
was a very, very beautiful woman,

01:47.334 --> 01:49.668
gave HIm all the pleasures of life,

01:49.875 --> 01:57.668
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.709
Also you know the story of His going

02:04.917 --> 02:11.417
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

02:11.668 --> 02:17.917
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

02:18.125 --> 02:21.709
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

02:22.167 --> 02:25.251
and ‘Why should people die?’.

02:25.459 --> 02:33.292
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

02:33.626 --> 02:37.334
and He started trying to understand

02:37.542 --> 02:40.709
why these things happen to human beings.

02:40.917 --> 02:43.292
With this the enquiry started.

02:43.542 --> 02:49.917
So He reached a point where

02:50.125 --> 02:57.251
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

02:57.459 --> 03:00.584
that were entangled around him by His father.

03:01.292 --> 03:04.334
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

03:04.542 --> 03:12.251
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

03:13.709 --> 03:20.292
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

03:20.501 --> 03:23.626
for the search of the truth because

03:23.833 --> 03:28.042
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

03:28.251 --> 03:35.709
And so He started from collective towards the center.

03:36.042 --> 03:38.334
When we see miseries all around us,

03:38.542 --> 03:41.209
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

03:41.417 --> 03:43.251
Will everybody get realization?

03:43.459 --> 03:45.501
Will everybody will have this, you see?

03:45.709 --> 03:51.000
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

03:51.292 --> 03:56.334
first of all we must know, are we all right?

03:57.833 --> 04:01.709
Have we - are we perfect?

04:01.917 --> 04:04.750
Are we full of joy?

04:04.959 --> 04:10.709
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

04:10.917 --> 04:15.542
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

04:15.709 --> 04:18.833
Because He started from the wrong point,

04:19.042 --> 04:21.875
searching it from the collective

04:22.084 --> 04:24.417
to remove the miseries of the people

04:24.626 --> 04:27.875
He had to go in a very round about way.

04:28.417 --> 04:32.542
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

04:32.709 --> 04:35.542
He went to big pundits,

04:35.709 --> 04:42.417
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

04:42.875 --> 04:49.209
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

04:49.709 --> 04:56.709
that is the ‘roga’, is the

04:58.709 --> 05:03.833
health or miserable physical body,

05:04.376 --> 05:09.542
then the death and the old age.

05:10.709 --> 05:13.501
He went and asked so many people

05:13.709 --> 05:17.792
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

05:18.292 --> 05:21.584
And then they said that you have to

05:21.792 --> 05:26.875
become old because you are born like that

05:27.334 --> 05:29.626
and you have to suffer

05:29.959 --> 05:32.084
because you commit sins.

05:32.292 --> 05:35.209
He was not satisfied with this answer.

05:35.959 --> 05:40.292
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

05:40.626 --> 05:44.209
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

05:44.417 --> 05:50.542
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

05:50.709 --> 05:54.792
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.125
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

06:03.334 --> 06:07.209
because He got so tired of His seeking.

06:07.417 --> 06:10.459
And after the sleep He got up

06:10.709 --> 06:14.542
and suddenly He got His Realization.

06:14.709 --> 06:19.209
And He thought the whole drama is over.

06:19.417 --> 06:24.459
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

06:24.668 --> 06:27.417
and She died just after the birth of the child.

06:27.626 --> 06:32.792
And He got His Realization.

06:33.167 --> 06:37.209
Now at that time when He got His Realization

06:37.417 --> 06:41.376
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

06:41.584 --> 06:45.376
that what it means Realization is.

06:45.584 --> 06:46.750
Nobody to decode

06:46.959 --> 06:52.875
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

06:53.167 --> 06:57.209
But because of His tremendous seeking

06:57.417 --> 07:01.959
and such ardent desire

07:02.376 --> 07:08.376
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

07:08.584 --> 07:10.626
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

07:10.833 --> 07:14.833
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

07:17.833 --> 07:21.626
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

07:21.833 --> 07:27.584
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

07:28.125 --> 07:32.042
the need of the time had to act firstly,

07:32.292 --> 07:39.000
secondly the need of the

07:39.251 --> 07:41.875
incarnation to come on this earth

07:42.125 --> 07:46.501
was first created in the human beings.

07:46.709 --> 07:51.668
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

07:51.875 --> 07:55.750
Brahmanism or priesthood

07:55.959 --> 08:00.584
and people were trying to take everything

08:00.792 --> 08:05.750
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

08:05.959 --> 08:13.125
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

08:13.334 --> 08:17.626
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

08:17.833 --> 08:19.833
the puja and everything He canceled.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.334
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

08:22.584 --> 08:26.000
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

08:26.209 --> 08:28.251
It's all a joke going on, you see.

08:28.459 --> 08:34.167
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

08:34.376 --> 08:37.125
that the whole world is a leela,

08:37.334 --> 08:41.750
is a play of God's own whims.

08:41.959 --> 08:43.709
So you just enjoy it.

08:44.417 --> 08:50.709
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

08:50.917 --> 08:52.626
which we had

08:52.833 --> 08:57.209
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

08:57.417 --> 08:58.167
You were there?

08:58.459 --> 09:00.501
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

09:00.709 --> 09:03.084
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.584
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

09:06.792 --> 09:10.501
So in the same way when Buddha came in

09:10.833 --> 09:13.584
first problem was that

09:13.792 --> 09:17.917
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

09:18.251 --> 09:21.501
Because in His search everybody told Him

09:21.709 --> 09:25.584
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

09:25.792 --> 09:30.042
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

09:30.251 --> 09:32.750
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

09:32.959 --> 09:35.042
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

09:35.251 --> 09:38.042
“Where is the God?”

09:38.251 --> 09:42.833
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.084
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

09:47.334 --> 09:50.542
and nothing unusual I should say.

09:50.709 --> 09:53.959
So this must be done by God, you see.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.501
If you cut your throat:

09:55.709 --> 10:00.750
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

10:01.125 --> 10:05.125
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

10:05.376 --> 10:08.459
Because everybody is going towards God.

10:08.833 --> 10:11.292
Then the people whom He met they said,

10:11.501 --> 10:14.042
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

10:14.251 --> 10:16.792
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

10:17.000 --> 10:18.959
Because he could mesmerize people,

10:19.167 --> 10:23.125
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

10:23.334 --> 10:26.709
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

10:26.917 --> 10:29.959
because people take God in the hand and use it

10:30.167 --> 10:31.709
for their own purpose,

10:31.917 --> 10:36.376
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

10:36.584 --> 10:38.125
and it’s God has

10:38.334 --> 10:40.750
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

10:41.167 --> 10:44.875
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

10:45.084 --> 10:48.626
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

10:48.833 --> 10:52.417
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

10:52.626 --> 10:55.000
and just doing all these horrible things

10:55.334 --> 11:01.125
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

11:01.334 --> 11:04.917
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

11:05.125 --> 11:07.501
they shave it completely.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.376
And they have to -

11:09.584 --> 11:13.167
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

11:13.376 --> 11:15.792
some walls of the temple.

11:16.084 --> 11:18.792
And the ladies who shaved their heads

11:19.084 --> 11:22.334
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

11:22.542 --> 11:26.917
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

11:27.251 --> 11:29.584
and the water is poured on them.

11:29.792 --> 11:33.251
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

11:33.542 --> 11:36.542
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

11:36.709 --> 11:39.084
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

11:39.292 --> 11:40.626
buckets after buckets.

11:40.833 --> 11:44.334
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

11:44.542 --> 11:45.917
you see one is finished then another one.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.833
Poor ladies rolling like that,

11:48.042 --> 11:53.709
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

11:54.167 --> 11:56.792
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

11:57.000 --> 12:00.251
And then later on you see they became modern,

12:00.542 --> 12:04.376
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

12:04.584 --> 12:08.501
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

12:08.709 --> 12:13.042
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

12:13.251 --> 12:17.125
and they sent it to England and other places.

12:17.376 --> 12:22.251
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

12:22.459 --> 12:24.750
ridiculous things were done!

12:24.959 --> 12:26.959
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

12:27.167 --> 12:30.376
The first step is Self-Realization.

12:30.668 --> 12:32.750
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.709
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

12:35.917 --> 12:38.459
first you get your Realization.

12:38.668 --> 12:42.084
That was the first condition, establish it.

12:42.292 --> 12:45.376
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

12:45.584 --> 12:46.542
- nothing doing.

12:46.709 --> 12:54.167
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

12:54.417 --> 12:57.501
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.584
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.084
So all that He started

13:02.292 --> 13:06.542
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

13:06.709 --> 13:11.251
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

13:11.542 --> 13:15.000
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

13:15.209 --> 13:18.334
means the one who is a Realized soul.

13:18.584 --> 13:22.376
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

13:22.584 --> 13:25.750
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

13:26.000 --> 13:32.292
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.

13:32.917 --> 13:36.251
You are all Buddhas because you know.

13:36.459 --> 13:40.125
When you know, you are the Buddha.

13:40.626 --> 13:43.959
Now without going into all that nonsense

13:44.167 --> 13:48.917
of renunciation and shaving your head and wearing that dress

13:49.125 --> 13:51.584
and everything, you have achieved your Realization.

13:51.792 --> 13:55.459
It’s a short circuit or a short path.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.542
Why? Because He started from the other side.

13:59.709 --> 14:05.542
But if He had started directly from Himself, you see,

14:06.376 --> 14:07.833
it would have been better.

14:08.042 --> 14:12.501
You see, in practical sense I'll tell you how it is.

14:15.042 --> 14:19.709
Supposing you want to repair your house.

14:20.042 --> 14:23.709
So you have to have instrument for that house.

14:24.292 --> 14:27.792
But supposing you are worried about all the houses of the world.

14:28.167 --> 14:33.167
and you start repairing, neither you'll repair other houses nor yours.

14:33.376 --> 14:37.042
So first you must practice on yourself.

14:38.209 --> 14:41.542
Put your attention to yourself first.

14:41.709 --> 14:46.709
Is also is a method by which you avoid

14:46.917 --> 14:48.792
seeing the point,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.417
seeing the reality,

14:50.709 --> 14:55.917
that, if you are not all right, how can you improve the whole world?

14:56.167 --> 14:59.750
So when your attention goes to other things, are

14:59.959 --> 15:02.792
you must know that there’s something wrong with you first of all,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.417
which must be corrected.

15:05.626 --> 15:06.833
And that’s why

15:07.042 --> 15:10.042
it took Him so much time to go round and round and round.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.959
He had to give up His wife, give up His family,

15:13.167 --> 15:16.292
give up everything and get to Realization.

15:16.668 --> 15:19.167
Because by giving up everything He realized

15:19.417 --> 15:22.125
that it is He, who should achieve it.

15:22.501 --> 15:25.167
It's a very circuitous way,

15:25.376 --> 15:27.459
but you can just say: It doesn't exist anything,

15:27.668 --> 15:31.084
first let me get all right - that’s Sahaja Yoga.

15:32.251 --> 15:36.668
Now what happened, that became a method for people to achieve God.

15:36.875 --> 15:42.125
Many people think that you must suffer like Christ to achieve God.

15:43.459 --> 15:46.959
You must renounce the world then achieve God.

15:47.167 --> 15:51.501
Actually renouncing the world and all that is just a myth.

15:51.709 --> 15:54.209
How do you renounce the world?

15:54.459 --> 15:56.209
It’s myth. What are you renouncing?

15:56.417 --> 15:59.125
I mean in any case, you can’t carry this with you, can you?

15:59.542 --> 16:03.542
I mean, can you even carry, I would say, even a thread?

16:03.709 --> 16:07.125
Nothing! When you come you come like this, you are born

16:07.459 --> 16:10.459
with closed fists. When you go, the hands are like this open.

16:10.709 --> 16:13.000
Have you ever seen a dead corpse?

16:13.209 --> 16:15.542
He always has his hands like this. Nothing can he take,

16:15.709 --> 16:18.917
just going like this.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.542
So you don't take anything from here.

16:21.709 --> 16:24.959
So this renouncing, this ‘I renounce that’, ‘I renounce that"

16:25.167 --> 16:29.626
'I’ll give up this’, ‘I’ll give up my wife’, ‘I’ll give up that",

16:30.000 --> 16:31.668
has no meaning.

16:32.334 --> 16:36.376
Because it’s a state of mind in which your

16:37.000 --> 16:41.584
being becomes -

16:41.792 --> 16:43.626
I don't know the English word for that

16:43.833 --> 16:47.917
which doesn't stick to something, what is it called?

16:49.959 --> 16:56.668
I don't know. You see, any substance that doesn't stick to anything.

16:56.875 --> 17:00.542
I mean we have all kind of stick plast. Yogi: Unattached?

17:00.709 --> 17:03.334
Shri Mataji: No, but that quality.

17:03.542 --> 17:09.084
There is a quality of the temperament, which doesn't stick to anything.

17:10.584 --> 17:13.542
Doesn't stick to anything, I mean you put it here, it will come out.

17:13.833 --> 17:18.167
You can say the soap or something like that –

17:18.376 --> 17:21.334
Yogi: Like mercury. Mother, like mercury, just flows.

17:21.584 --> 17:23.709
Shri Mataji: Ah - like mercury.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.584
But mercury also you can apply sometimes,

17:26.792 --> 17:29.792
you know with heat and, but this is something beyond mercury,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.417
is absolute, which doesn't stick to anything, you see.

17:34.626 --> 17:36.209
You just become like that.

17:36.417 --> 17:40.668
All you do, wear this, you wear that, you have this, all right.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.084
You are never stuck.

17:43.334 --> 17:48.251
Then name of the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’, ‘Nirmama’,

17:48.251 --> 17:51.417
that for Her nothing is Her own, you see,

17:51.626 --> 17:53.959
see, She doesn't stick to anything.

17:54.459 --> 17:57.709
She is in everything, but She doesn't stick to anything.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.459
For example now see the light here,

18:00.668 --> 18:06.251
it’s not sticking to anything, it exists by itself.

18:06.584 --> 18:08.668
It doesn’t stick to anything.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.709
This is the nearest you can say, it doesn't stick to anything.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.417
Any but thing tries to stick it gets burned, that’s a good idea.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.292
So this is what it is,

18:21.501 --> 18:25.750
this is called an enlightened person doesn't stick to anything.

18:26.292 --> 18:30.917
And whatever tries to come very close gets burnt off.

18:31.125 --> 18:36.792
So, such a person is not attached to anything.

18:37.042 --> 18:39.792
But that’s not a mental thing that you can do

18:40.000 --> 18:41.542
that, “Oh I am not attached to you”, you see.

18:41.709 --> 18:44.917
It’s very common in this country especially, “I hate you”.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.668
Then you can't hate anyone. How can you?

18:47.875 --> 18:49.959
And nor can you love anyone because

18:50.167 --> 18:56.125
the attachment cannot give you both the qualities.

18:56.334 --> 19:00.251
You see, because you are attached to someone,

19:00.459 --> 19:04.709
you say that you hate, simultaneously you are loving that person.

19:04.917 --> 19:10.000
Because these are the dual qualities of attachment, see?

19:10.251 --> 19:13.584
So once you have attachment you have both things.

19:13.792 --> 19:16.459
One moment you hate, another moment you love,

19:16.709 --> 19:17.959
another moment you hate,

19:18.167 --> 19:20.501
then you love and you don't know what's the matter with yourself.

19:20.833 --> 19:25.334
But the thing is the quality of the mind is such that

19:25.542 --> 19:30.334
it is either getting attached mentally

19:30.542 --> 19:33.833
or either getting detached mentally.

19:34.417 --> 19:40.251
But actually anybody say, you love someone very much.

19:40.542 --> 19:44.542
Now you don't even die together, whatever you may try.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.334
You cannot die together.

19:46.542 --> 19:49.501
One person has to die earlier, another has to die later.

19:50.209 --> 19:54.459
So the answer to His question that He asked was,

19:54.709 --> 19:56.709
“Why all these things are caused?”

19:56.917 --> 20:02.292
So he said, it is because of desire.

20:02.626 --> 20:07.542
Because of human desire, these are all problems are caused,

20:07.709 --> 20:14.542
like the death, like the old age

20:14.750 --> 20:17.668
or the sickness, are caused by desire.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.833
Now see in Sahaja Yoga language how we should understand Him.

20:23.417 --> 20:28.792
Is the desire, as you know, is the left side.

20:31.167 --> 20:34.542
Left side gives you death.

20:34.709 --> 20:39.251
When the left side is very much used

20:39.459 --> 20:43.417
you get to death, ultimately when it is exhausted.

20:43.668 --> 20:48.459
When the left side is out, desire,

20:48.668 --> 20:52.167
you also get sickness.

20:52.792 --> 21:00.626
And when the left side is used too much you get your old age.

21:01.334 --> 21:06.668
Of course the right side is the one which does it,

21:06.875 --> 21:09.875
but the left side is the originator.

21:10.084 --> 21:13.459
If you have no desire you won't go into the right side.

21:13.668 --> 21:18.209
First is the desire, the starting point is the desire.

21:18.501 --> 21:21.917
He reached the point all right, but He didn't clearly say

21:22.125 --> 21:25.668
what desire means: Desire means the left side.

21:25.959 --> 21:32.417
When we have the pure desire, which is the Kundalini,

21:32.668 --> 21:36.167
then all these things are neutralized.

21:37.209 --> 21:41.792
When the Kundalini rises the pure desire, the real desire,

21:42.042 --> 21:44.792
the only desire, it gives you the absolute

21:45.000 --> 21:48.501
by which you don't get old,

21:48.709 --> 21:53.334
you don’t die and you do not get sick.

21:53.542 --> 22:00.042
Because you achieve that which is eternal, it does not die.

22:00.292 --> 22:01.750
You become the Spirit.

22:01.959 --> 22:04.334
When you want to die, you die.

22:04.584 --> 22:08.125
When you want to be reborn, you are reborn, and

22:08.459 --> 22:14.334
you have that realized temperament within you. It does not die.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.084
That's what you take with you.

22:17.334 --> 22:23.709
Now you take your Realization with you when you die.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.959
So what He tried to say was to build up

22:27.167 --> 22:30.334
that we should not have any desires.

22:30.542 --> 22:34.959
Now because, you see, His passage was like that, He went from

22:35.376 --> 22:38.584
one to another, giving up this desire, that desire, that desire,

22:38.792 --> 22:42.709
that desire - ultimately He came to Kundalini.

22:43.501 --> 22:46.833
There’s a saying, “Ya neti neti vachanair nigama avocham”

22:47.042 --> 22:48.042
When you go on saying:

22:48.251 --> 22:51.084
'Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this',

22:51.459 --> 22:53.875
then you go to a point, when you say “Then

22:54.334 --> 22:59.167
what ultimately left is the desire, which is the pure desire,

22:59.376 --> 23:01.750
the desire, that is the Kundalini.

23:02.084 --> 23:03.542
Say for example

23:03.709 --> 23:06.084
you say, “I’ll have a house -  no, no, I’ll not have a house,

23:06.292 --> 23:07.542
I’ll have a car, no, no car,no,

23:07.709 --> 23:11.209
I’ll not have a wife, I’ll not look at any woman.

23:11.417 --> 23:13.042
I’ll have nothing to do with it.

23:13.251 --> 23:17.042
I'll give up this, give up that, give up that, give up that.

23:17.417 --> 23:23.000
Till you reach a point where you are at an absolute point.

23:23.209 --> 23:25.875
And there you realize that the Kundalini rises.

23:26.251 --> 23:27.334
But I think it is going too far.

23:27.542 --> 23:30.334
Why not start from the Kundalini rising? There.

23:32.668 --> 23:33.750
Is a simple thing.

23:33.959 --> 23:37.084
So Sahaja Yoga is the other way round stuff,

23:37.292 --> 23:39.626
is that you better start from the Kundalini.

23:39.875 --> 23:43.251
and neutralize all your left side.

23:44.459 --> 23:45.584
You see the point now?

23:45.792 --> 23:50.251
That's why Buddha was always regarded as an atheist.

23:50.584 --> 23:53.251
He was not. He was not an atheist.

23:53.459 --> 23:56.292
But as a matter of policy,

23:57.167 --> 24:00.251
He and Mahavira -they were contemporary -

24:00.459 --> 24:06.917
they decided: Let's not have the name of God anywhere near,

24:07.292 --> 24:09.709
because once you start the god business,

24:09.917 --> 24:15.251
big philosophies are built and people just start claiming it.

24:15.542 --> 24:17.042
I mean, they become that!

24:17.251 --> 24:22.209
Actually anybody who reads Geeta becomes a sort of a Krishna,

24:22.459 --> 24:24.209
Shri Krishna Himself, it’s the way he talks,

24:24.542 --> 24:27.417
people - you can be shocked the way they talk I mean

24:27.626 --> 24:30.501
they are Shri Krishna, giving an advice to Arjuna, you know,

24:30.709 --> 24:32.459
sitting on a chariot.

24:32.668 --> 24:35.792
They behave in that manner, you know their style is like that.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
I met one fellow called Chinmayanand

24:39.251 --> 24:42.584
and I was amazed you know the way he was talking,  I was surprised,

24:42.792 --> 24:45.084
I mean he was just behaving like Shri Krishna,

24:45.292 --> 24:46.833
of course horrid looking,

24:47.042 --> 24:51.542
but, he thought he was Shri Krishna himself, you see.

24:51.709 --> 24:54.584
So that's what identification takes place with human beings

24:54.792 --> 24:57.501
when they start talking about God or His ways and others.

24:57.709 --> 24:59.542
So He said: "All right put that out,

24:59.709 --> 25:03.042
just talk about Self-Realization. That's the first step."

25:03.251 --> 25:07.501
And Mahavira joined hands with Him.

25:07.875 --> 25:10.209
It helped that time very much,

25:10.501 --> 25:14.376
to all the people who were in the name of ritualism you see,

25:14.584 --> 25:16.750
they would say, “It’s very difficult, you know,

25:16.959 --> 25:20.167
Hinduism is the most difficult thing."

25:20.417 --> 25:25.000
You have to fast on Sunday, because of the sun,

25:25.209 --> 25:27.833
Monday because of the moon,

25:28.042 --> 25:31.750
Tuesday because of the Mars. Like that went on and on,

25:31.959 --> 25:35.959
and when do you eat your food?

25:36.167 --> 25:40.042
If you have to achieve God then you have to

25:40.251 --> 25:44.125
take your bath at four o’clock and do this and do that and

25:44.459 --> 25:47.750
shave your head and then you become a sanyasi,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.167
and you can't eat this and you can't eat that,

25:51.376 --> 25:55.209
and you can't do that - all those things ritualistic they started.

25:55.584 --> 25:59.542
But He felt that supposing if you take to sanyasa,

25:59.709 --> 26:03.209
so half of your desires are finished, you are a sanyasi,

26:03.417 --> 26:06.292
you are doing God's work

26:06.501 --> 26:09.125
and there is no need to have a family or anything,

26:09.334 --> 26:11.251
so half of your desires are finished.

26:11.459 --> 26:14.376
If you have a family then you want to do something for the family,

26:14.584 --> 26:17.875
you have to look after your family and all that is to be done.

26:18.125 --> 26:23.501
But He did not realize that He was a Realized soul, others were not.

26:23.709 --> 26:29.542
You see, if a realized soul does that, it has no difference to him;

26:29.709 --> 26:31.292
whether he has a family or no family

26:31.501 --> 26:32.833
makes no difference to a realized soul,

26:33.042 --> 26:34.334
because he is not attached.

26:34.542 --> 26:39.167
But to a person who is not a realized soul,

26:39.417 --> 26:42.584
supposing he’ll give up his car, he’ll give up his house,

26:42.792 --> 26:44.459
go to the Himalayas.

26:44.668 --> 26:45.668
There, what he’ll do?

26:45.875 --> 26:52.334
He’ll have a hut and have a barbed thing around or so.

26:53.125 --> 26:56.292
Then he may think of a Georgian style of a house

26:56.501 --> 26:59.542
if he's an English man,

26:59.750 --> 27:03.875
because according to them Georgian style is unpretentious,

27:04.084 --> 27:07.668
so we can have, after all we are sanyasis!

27:07.875 --> 27:09.084
That’s typical!

27:09.292 --> 27:14.833
I tell you all our western mind is behaving in that way, if you see,

27:15.084 --> 27:18.000
that we should be unpretentious, you see, it’s very fussy,

27:18.292 --> 27:19.334
is the word they will use.

27:19.542 --> 27:22.750
If you put even a little [thing]: "Oh it’s very fussy."

27:22.959 --> 27:26.709
They want everything to be plain, blunt, you see?

27:27.000 --> 27:32.459
But what about inside? I’s filled with what?

27:32.668 --> 27:37.000
All bottled up with all kinds of rums, this, that.

27:37.251 --> 27:41.833
But the outside should be absolutely blunt, you know.

27:42.042 --> 27:43.833
The food should not be,

27:44.042 --> 27:47.125
if possible just get it in its natural form.

27:47.334 --> 27:50.542
If not, don’t have any taste in it.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.626
It should be so blunt that

27:52.833 --> 27:56.334
any guest who comes to your house must starve, you see.

27:56.542 --> 28:01.084
All these funny ideas cropped up in that - of asceticism.

28:01.334 --> 28:03.542
Then we have other people like Shamballas.

28:03.709 --> 28:06.125
who are going now to Gobi desert.

28:06.334 --> 28:09.000
You see, they thought that this desert is not sufficient,

28:09.209 --> 28:10.417
let’s go to Gobi desert.

28:10.626 --> 28:12.417
So they are going now to Gobi desert.

28:12.626 --> 28:14.959
All these absurd ideas

28:15.167 --> 28:19.668
came out of Buddhism, and also Jainism.

28:19.875 --> 28:23.209
Jainis went to the other extreme in vegetarianism,

28:23.584 --> 28:28.292
because Buddha Himself was not a vegetarian, do you know that?

28:28.501 --> 28:33.334
He was not Himself a vegetarian, nor was Mahavira.

28:33.542 --> 28:39.750
You will be surprised: Vegetarianism for them was a philosophy.

28:39.959 --> 28:46.833
It was not a sort of a thing where you don't eat meat and all,

28:47.042 --> 28:52.125
because Buddha Himself died when He went to one of His disciples

28:52.334 --> 29:00.334
who was a ‘shikari’ – hunter.

29:00.709 --> 29:04.709
And the hunter had killed a wild boar.

29:04.917 --> 29:08.584
And he said that the wild boar has been killed just now

29:08.833 --> 29:14.668
and it will take some time to cook, it’s rather half done, you see.

29:14.917 --> 29:18.542
I mean, He beeing an Indian, He could not eat that half done thing

29:18.709 --> 29:25.125
and He got diseased of, I think, this liver or something got

29:25.417 --> 29:28.084
into problem and He died of that, you see.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.000
I mean, I can't eat half done food Myself.

29:31.209 --> 29:33.959
"This is half done now." Half done is a horrible stuff,

29:34.167 --> 29:36.376
but we eat because it is unpretentious, you see

29:36.709 --> 29:37.875
or some sort of a thing.

29:38.084 --> 29:42.875
People have idea it’s not, it’s very next to the nature, you see.

29:43.084 --> 29:46.334
This is what is coming. But it’s all deliberate.

29:46.626 --> 29:48.584
You are attached inside.

29:48.792 --> 29:52.417
Outside, if you behave like that you are not going to become that.

29:52.626 --> 29:58.084
Like Hippies have an idea, if they live like primitive people,

29:58.292 --> 30:02.542
then they become primitive. You cannot, your brain is modern.

30:02.709 --> 30:05.833
Just by living, you see, wearing a wig like a hippy,

30:06.042 --> 30:07.501
can I become primitive?

30:07.709 --> 30:10.084
I cannot, My brain is modern, you see?

30:10.292 --> 30:14.417
That’s what people don't understand, that we are too deliberate.

30:14.626 --> 30:17.709
And all these deliberations can be only reduced

30:17.917 --> 30:22.292
if your Self comes into your attention.

30:22.501 --> 30:27.376
Otherwise all these are just our mental projections.

30:27.584 --> 30:32.376
So all these sanyasa and all these ideas came gradually,

30:32.584 --> 30:35.125
everyone who came on this Earth,

30:35.334 --> 30:38.917
people have really made a mess out of them.

30:39.125 --> 30:42.792
And Buddha's mess has gone to such an extent

30:43.000 --> 30:46.417
that if you see that you’ll be shocked.

30:46.833 --> 30:49.709
It went into many formations.

30:49.959 --> 30:51.792
But I heard from My son-in-law that

30:52.000 --> 30:54.209
he went and visited some of the caves

30:54.417 --> 30:57.833
where the very early Buddhist lived, very early Buddhist lived.

30:58.042 --> 31:01.709
In the caves, because they were not supported by kings or anything,

31:01.917 --> 31:03.875
so they had a very bad time.

31:04.084 --> 31:05.833
And they used to live in the caves.

31:06.042 --> 31:11.334
And what My son-in-law told Me that in the caves there are writings

31:11.584 --> 31:16.167
in Sanskrit, in Pali and in Indian script,

31:16.417 --> 31:19.959
saying that it is the spontaneous happening

31:20.167 --> 31:23.709
that can bring forth the Self-Realization.

31:24.251 --> 31:28.084
He has got that photographed.

31:28.417 --> 31:31.875
So it’s coming forward. You see, so they knew about it,

31:32.084 --> 31:35.251
the Sahaja Yoga, they knew about it.

31:35.459 --> 31:38.501
But then as every religion has gone into a mess

31:38.709 --> 31:44.501
and lot of funny sort of, we can say the -

31:44.709 --> 31:50.209
funny sort of expressions, also Buddhism has gone,

31:50.417 --> 31:54.459
it became Mahayan, Hinayan, all sorts of things.

31:54.668 --> 32:00.000
But one of them was called as Vidhitama,

32:00.251 --> 32:03.917
who ran away from India, settled down in Japan

32:04.209 --> 32:07.209
and he started the Zen system of religion,

32:07.417 --> 32:10.167
which he kept to the spontaneous happening.

32:10.376 --> 32:12.959
That one was preserved.

32:13.167 --> 32:18.875
Another was the Lao Tse style, who did not talk of God

32:19.084 --> 32:22.417
and of Buddha, but of Tao itself -

32:22.626 --> 32:26.833
the energy or we can say about the Adishakti.

32:27.042 --> 32:30.209
So these two good things came out of Him.

32:30.417 --> 32:35.542
While they searched back into the history of China

32:35.709 --> 32:38.251
and they found out the Adishakti

32:38.459 --> 32:42.417
lived many years back there as Kuan Yin.

32:42.668 --> 32:46.584
And that’s how Kuan Yin was established

32:46.792 --> 32:50.501
as a Goddess for many Buddhists.

32:50.709 --> 32:55.167
Now then Buddha also got

32:55.376 --> 32:58.459
into another form because

32:58.709 --> 33:01.542
there was a big competition between Hinduism,

33:01.750 --> 33:05.959
Hindus of those days and the Buddhists.

33:06.167 --> 33:07.959
So they wanted to form,

33:08.167 --> 33:11.709
for ordinary people it’s very difficult to understand the philosophy

33:12.000 --> 33:16.125
so they thought that we should have Buddha expressed

33:16.334 --> 33:19.875
as He has been and He will be.

33:20.125 --> 33:25.875
So they formed their, you see, as you see He is a Matreya

33:26.084 --> 33:28.668
is going to come, the future Buddha is Bodhisatva

33:28.875 --> 33:31.501
and they started making His statues and everything.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.334
So they made Buddha as the God.

33:34.584 --> 33:40.626
They started using Him to represent the Divine Power,

33:40.875 --> 33:44.084
giving Him forms and things and like hat many things happened.

33:44.292 --> 33:47.709
But Buddha Himself was so much frightened of the ritualism

33:47.917 --> 33:51.042
that He said, “You should not worship anything,

33:51.251 --> 33:53.584
you should not build any temples

33:53.875 --> 33:55.833
so you see the loophole was found out,

33:56.042 --> 33:59.292
if temples are not to be built, we’ll build stupas.

33:59.709 --> 34:05.000
Now in the Stupas they put the tooth of Buddha,

34:05.209 --> 34:07.833
of course that was sensible to do I must say,

34:08.167 --> 34:10.292
but of course Buddha had said not to do it.

34:10.501 --> 34:12.709
And they put it there, He had two disciples,

34:12.917 --> 34:15.251
called as Sariputta and Moggallana.

34:15.459 --> 34:17.792
They were very good disciples of His

34:18.000 --> 34:22.542
and their bones were collected after they were burnt out

34:22.709 --> 34:25.292
and were put in the stupa.

34:25.501 --> 34:28.584
That was something definitely sensible to put them there.

34:28.792 --> 34:31.626
Of course the bones and all these things should not be disturbed

34:31.833 --> 34:34.584
because it’s not good, it creates a problem for the body.

34:34.792 --> 34:39.334
But at least if they have put it there in the Mother Earth

34:39.542 --> 34:42.542
it would have been all right. but they put it in caskets.

34:42.709 --> 34:45.709
Now the first casket was made of gold,

34:45.917 --> 34:50.334
the second of silver, the third of iron,

34:50.542 --> 34:54.459
the fourth one of wood sort of a thing, mummified those things.

34:54.709 --> 34:56.959
That was a very wrong thing to do, because

34:57.167 --> 34:59.376
because if you go on keeping like that,

34:59.584 --> 35:01.542
some parts of the body of these great people,

35:01.833 --> 35:09.167
it can hamper their rebirth or their body

35:09.376 --> 35:12.084
which they want to again incarnate, you see.

35:12.292 --> 35:14.709
But hair is all right or nails are all right,

35:14.917 --> 35:17.833
but you shouldn’t keep the part of dead body like that.

35:18.042 --> 35:22.917
And this kind of thing gave another nonsensical ideas to

35:23.292 --> 35:25.125
to horrible human beeings.

35:25.459 --> 35:30.000
What they did, that they thought that if we have to keep some part

35:30.334 --> 35:33.417
of the person who died like divine person,

35:33.626 --> 35:37.376
why not we cut the hand of someone and like that.

35:37.584 --> 35:43.292
So in Tibet and all these places, specially in Ladhak, you see,

35:43.542 --> 35:46.875
they used to cut the hands of the people when they died

35:47.084 --> 35:48.709
and big ritual for the dead

35:48.917 --> 35:51.167
and then they started going towards the dead.

35:51.376 --> 35:54.875
So they started moving towards the left side.

35:55.084 --> 35:58.334
Most of the Buddhists moved to the left side,

35:58.542 --> 36:04.251
which was absolutely prohibited by Buddha,

36:04.501 --> 36:07.709
because He is on the right side.

36:07.917 --> 36:14.501
He said, “Cut down your desires, do the karmas without the desire”.

36:14.709 --> 36:16.042
This was His idea.

36:16.251 --> 36:20.542
Activate your right side without the desire.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.376
This was His philosophy.

36:22.833 --> 36:26.584
But they - all of them are left sided.

36:26.833 --> 36:30.709
They have desires, not only desires

36:30.917 --> 36:34.626
but whatever they do they do it out of desire.

36:34.833 --> 36:39.376
Like the worst is like the Japanese,

36:39.626 --> 36:43.792
they think that you can

36:44.000 --> 36:50.334
commit suicide in the name of your nation.

36:50.709 --> 36:55.709
With this desire they will commit suicide.

36:56.084 --> 36:58.167
To save their country they can commit suicide.

36:58.376 --> 37:00.334
I mean it is absurd.

37:00.542 --> 37:04.084
He said, “Whatever you have to do, do without the desire”,

37:04.292 --> 37:05.875
which is a difficult thing for human beings.

37:06.084 --> 37:09.792
How many there are who are doing it without desire?

37:10.125 --> 37:13.542
And whatever we do, we do out of desire.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.000
Even at the subtler point.

37:16.251 --> 37:17.668
Even when we do puja,

37:17.875 --> 37:22.875
we do with the desire that our vibrations will improve.

37:23.084 --> 37:27.709
Can we think of a state where it is absolutely desireless?

37:28.042 --> 37:34.709
Only one person has that, there’s no desire, desireless.

37:34.917 --> 37:37.209
The whole thing is done without any desire,

37:37.417 --> 37:39.542
so there is no disappointment.

37:40.584 --> 37:42.167
There is no unhappiness.

37:42.376 --> 37:43.668
You are going to America,

37:43.875 --> 37:49.709
knowingly that is going to be a horrible experience,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.750
but it’s a joke, just going to see the joke.

37:53.959 --> 37:56.292
Without any hope,

37:56.626 --> 38:01.334
maybe it might work out to be something tremendous,

38:01.542 --> 38:03.084
but no desires.

38:03.292 --> 38:07.542
You see, it’s so desireless the whole personality is,

38:07.750 --> 38:09.459
that even if I have to desire for something

38:09.668 --> 38:11.000
I have to ask you, "You better desire!",

38:11.209 --> 38:13.709
because I have lost the sense of desire.

38:13.959 --> 38:17.125
So many times I’ve said you better do it for Me.

38:17.334 --> 38:20.709
Unless and until you pray to Me I can't do it.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.917
That's why I asked you write to Me a letter,

38:23.125 --> 38:24.376
because you see, I can't desire,

38:24.584 --> 38:26.251
i really don't. I don't do anything!

38:26.459 --> 38:29.542
Without doing anything it is happening. So why should I desire?

38:29.709 --> 38:33.376
I really don't do anything.

38:33.668 --> 38:36.542
You'll be amazed, I don't do anything, I don't desire anything,

38:36.709 --> 38:38.626
nothing of the kind, it’s working I am just watching.

38:38.833 --> 38:39.626
Still you are saying,

38:39.833 --> 38:45.750
“Mother you aredoing it.” I'm quite surprised!

38:46.167 --> 38:47.833
That is Tao.

38:48.042 --> 38:49.459
If you read about Tao,

38:49.709 --> 38:52.792
it is said that it doesn’t do anything.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.959
But everything works out.

38:57.167 --> 39:00.251
So this is what He said, which was all sahaja,

39:00.459 --> 39:02.833
that you have to be desireless

39:03.042 --> 39:05.668
and do everything,

39:05.875 --> 39:11.000
and He is the one who controls our ego.

39:11.209 --> 39:16.251
Because if you have no desire you will have no ego either.

39:16.959 --> 39:18.626
Ego is only built up

39:18.833 --> 39:22.334
when you have a desire to do something.

39:22.542 --> 39:27.334
That is you just do it for fun, just for joy, just for doing it.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.875
Then how will you build up ego? You cannot.

39:30.084 --> 39:33.959
Like an artist is painting just for fun and throwing it away.

39:34.209 --> 39:38.292
Creating something just for fun – that’s what God is.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.792
Not with the desire to achieve something.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.875
I mean the desire is so gross, can be extremely gross.

39:44.209 --> 39:47.376
It can become subtler and subtler and subtler. That’s a good way.

39:47.709 --> 39:51.084
But can be very, very gross also,

39:51.292 --> 39:54.501
like some people can believe that, you see,

39:54.709 --> 39:59.334
“I should painting, because I'll get so much money."

39:59.626 --> 40:02.292
Or "I can sell it to somebody

40:02.501 --> 40:06.042
who may be the worst man, but I’ll sell it because I can get more money.”

40:06.251 --> 40:08.833
That’s absolutely the grossest of all, you see.

40:09.042 --> 40:12.626
That you can go to the most sinful things, I mean, I don’t know,

40:12.833 --> 40:15.459
there can be even worse desires than that,

40:15.709 --> 40:17.084
can be very many.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.792
But on this auspicious day we should not think of them

40:20.042 --> 40:24.125
which are there like that, but minimum of minimum,

40:24.334 --> 40:30.167
if you come, just do your puja, just for the joy of it,

40:30.792 --> 40:33.501
not with any desires.

40:33.917 --> 40:35.709
Just for the joy of it.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.251
I mean we are doing so many things like that.

40:38.459 --> 40:42.584
For example, we enjoy each other’s company.

40:42.792 --> 40:44.709
Just, just think of that!

40:44.917 --> 40:47.292
We all Sahaja Yogis are enjoying each other’s company,

40:47.542 --> 40:51.084
what’s this for? Nothing at all. There’s no, nothing.

40:52.417 --> 40:55.459
Just, you are enjoying it without any desire.

40:55.709 --> 41:00.875
Just say, for enjoyment’s sake, enjoyment.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.292
When that purity comes, you see in our temperament,

41:04.584 --> 41:07.501
that we do everything without any desire,

41:07.792 --> 41:10.917
we have got rid of all the ego.

41:11.125 --> 41:12.709
The Buddha is awakened within us.

41:12.917 --> 41:15.376
And that’s what is the importance of Buddha,

41:15.584 --> 41:17.584
that He settled down Himself

41:17.792 --> 41:20.501
in a place which is the most difficult place,

41:20.875 --> 41:23.792
that is on the left side of your head, you see.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.334
Sometimes I've seen it projects here up to this point, you know,

41:27.542 --> 41:30.501
in some people they get such a terrible pain, you know,

41:30.709 --> 41:33.542
pulling it out from there, can't imagine.

41:33.709 --> 41:39.125
So this horrible point which is  -

41:39.417 --> 41:43.167
so funny it is, sometimes it can blow up like that, you see,

41:43.376 --> 41:46.626
sometimes it can pierce through. It’s a horrible one

41:46.875 --> 41:49.792
which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.167
and it takes it forms in different ways and methods.

41:53.417 --> 41:58.833
For that we have to say, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

41:59.042 --> 42:03.417
means: We surrender ourselves to Buddha.

42:04.334 --> 42:07.042
Then what does He say? The second one is very good:

42:07.251 --> 42:10.042
‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’:

42:10.292 --> 42:13.042
I surrender myself to collectivity, ‘sangham’.

42:13.251 --> 42:15.542
‘Sangha’ is the collectivity.

42:15.709 --> 42:19.334
I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.

42:19.626 --> 42:22.584
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity,

42:22.792 --> 42:24.251
which is the enlightenment,

42:24.459 --> 42:28.709
you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha.”

42:29.084 --> 42:33.833
Secondly you say: “I surrender myself to collectivity.”

42:34.084 --> 42:37.709
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

42:38.792 --> 42:41.417
So, ‘I surrender myself to collectivity’,

42:41.626 --> 42:49.626
so we say: “Sangham Sharanam Gachhami.”

42:50.875 --> 42:57.042
It is to Virat we are doing.

42:57.251 --> 43:00.042
What is the third one, is? "BuddhamSharanam Gachhami",

43:00.251 --> 43:03.792
"Sangham Sharanam Gachhami", the third one -

43:04.000 --> 43:05.376
‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

43:05.584 --> 43:07.875
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami. ‘Dhammam’ means

43:08.125 --> 43:10.334
the religion - the balance.

43:10.542 --> 43:14.542
I surrender myself to religion, which is  essence of you,

43:14.709 --> 43:16.709
or you can put it the other way round,

43:16.959 --> 43:21.917
that, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami, Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami,

43:22.125 --> 43:23.542
Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’.

43:23.750 --> 43:27.875
That's all. If you have achieved it then we can talk of God.

43:28.167 --> 43:32.167
Not before that.

43:32.376 --> 43:34.668
So these three things are to be achieved.

43:34.875 --> 43:37.167
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this:

43:37.417 --> 43:41.459
First of all: ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

43:41.709 --> 43:47.542
‘I surrender myself to my virtues’.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.125
All desires can be surrendered to a virtue.

43:50.542 --> 43:53.501
Is it virtuous to do like this?

43:53.709 --> 43:56.251
You can, if you are brought up that way you’ll just not do it.

43:56.459 --> 43:57.875
You'll have no desires to do something,

43:58.084 --> 44:00.084
that is not virtuous and righteous.

44:00.292 --> 44:01.917
You will just not do it.

44:02.125 --> 44:05.125
So, ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’.

44:05.334 --> 44:08.167
Then you should say, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami’, means:

44:08.376 --> 44:10.709
I surrender myself to my enlightenment.

44:10.917 --> 44:13.875
This is the second state, when you are ascended.

44:14.084 --> 44:18.959
Surrender myself to enlightenment.

44:19.167 --> 44:22.792
Enlightenment that I've got to my Spirit.

44:23.125 --> 44:25.209
Is the Spirit who is going to guide you.

44:25.417 --> 44:30.584
No more my physical, mental, emotional nonsensical temptations.

44:30.792 --> 44:33.501
But what? Is the Spirit?

44:33.917 --> 44:37.668
And thirdly: ‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’, to the collectivity,

44:38.084 --> 44:41.334
to the whole, to the Virat.

44:41.542 --> 44:44.334
This is the way we have to work it out.

44:44.542 --> 44:47.042
So ultimately he reached the same point,

44:47.251 --> 44:50.792
that let me start it from myself.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.668
It's from myself to others, not from others to myself.

44:55.875 --> 45:00.376
Is like treating the tree from outside, not from the roots.

45:00.833 --> 45:03.668
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

45:03.875 --> 45:06.875
First you get your Realization,all right,

45:07.084 --> 45:13.875
then you learn how to surrender yourself to your Dharma.

45:14.125 --> 45:18.626
Then you become collectively conscious.

45:18.833 --> 45:21.917
Collectivity is a temperament,

45:22.125 --> 45:28.459
is a sense of enjoyment that you get in the collective living.

45:28.833 --> 45:36.792
Unless and until you have that you have not achieved your joy.

45:38.709 --> 45:44.750
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives

45:45.251 --> 45:49.709
and He is a very great powerful force within us.

45:50.125 --> 45:56.459
I’m very happy that Buddha Jayanti has fallen here in England,

45:56.668 --> 46:00.417
because as we say the England is the Heart of the universe -

46:00.626 --> 46:05.042
it doesn't matter if I say here, is any Arab here?

46:06.209 --> 46:10.125
I don't want to displease any Arab people sitting here.

46:10.376 --> 46:15.584
All right. And if it is the heart

46:15.792 --> 46:21.251
whatever you do here will circulate in the whole universe.

46:21.542 --> 46:24.376
So if you can conquer your ego here,

46:24.584 --> 46:30.209
you can even conquer the ego of Mister Reagan and these Russians.

46:30.417 --> 46:33.334
You can manage that. But first start it here.

46:33.584 --> 46:35.542
It has to reverse back you see, now

46:35.750 --> 46:41.376
they have to learn from you and you don’t learn from them.

46:41.792 --> 46:47.668
When it will work out you’ll be amazed.

46:47.917 --> 46:52.042
Ego is the only problem I always face reaching their hearts.

46:52.417 --> 46:56.542
If ego is removed everything will be all right.

46:56.709 --> 47:02.417
So for us the great mantra is "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami".

47:02.833 --> 47:07.459
These three mantras you must say everyday I think,

47:07.668 --> 47:12.792
to get rid of this horrible ego.

47:13.042 --> 47:15.417
Now, any questions on Buddha you have?

47:15.668 --> 47:23.626
I've made it in a short way – the whole life it is very difficult.

47:37.833 --> 47:44.125
It’s receding - ego.

47:51.292 --> 47:53.833
English are wise people, sound people,

47:54.042 --> 47:55.251
and they must understand this, that

47:55.459 --> 47:57.292
is a very, very important thing

47:57.501 --> 48:00.334
that they should not loose these qualities

48:00.542 --> 48:04.875
and should try to fix their enlightenment

48:05.084 --> 48:10.292
in such a way that it circulates.

48:23.501 --> 48:28.501
Any question?

48:31.626 --> 48:34.209
Gavin told Me yesterday it is Buddha Jayanti. I was very happy,

48:34.417 --> 48:36.668
because in England I've not talked of Buddha

48:36.875 --> 48:41.709
but otherwise I have talked about Him elsewhere.

49:16.125 --> 49:23.125
So now, that's why I wore, you see, a Buddha's shawl

49:23.875 --> 49:31.459
because it is suggesting of a detached mind

49:32.167 --> 49:36.167
which has no color.

49:36.501 --> 49:40.417
And

49:41.709 --> 49:47.792
there could be a personality which is colourless.

49:49.251 --> 49:57.209
but you can have it covered with colours to make others happy.

50:00.251 --> 50:05.792
So when you are a Realized Soul, whatever you do is natural.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.125
Whatever you do.

50:07.334 --> 50:09.334
If I am wearing this, now I am a Buddha.

50:09.542 --> 50:12.792
When I take it out, I'm Adi Shakti.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.209
Is not a drama, is a fact.

50:18.417 --> 50:23.668
But if you are not a realized soul, before that whatever you do it’s just a drama.

50:26.084 --> 50:28.334
For example, this is an artificial thing,

50:28.542 --> 50:30.917
I put My hand there anything, nothing will burn.

50:31.125 --> 50:33.875
But if it is real, it will definitely burn, whatever I may try.

50:34.084 --> 50:36.084
It's like that.

50:40.709 --> 50:43.209
So if somebody is a real person

50:43.417 --> 50:46.084
whatever he does is not a drama,

50:46.292 --> 50:48.292
is reality.

50:49.709 --> 50:51.000
That's how they say

50:51.209 --> 50:53.917
that She can take this form, She can take thav form

50:54.125 --> 50:55.750
people don't understand, how can

50:55.959 --> 50:58.584
one person take so forms. Can.

50:58.833 --> 51:01.542
if it is Reality, it can.

51:01.709 --> 51:04.167
Like the Mother Earh, She is a Reality,

51:04.417 --> 51:08.584
and the sap that is coming from the Mother Earth

51:08.792 --> 51:10.959
takes so many forms.

51:11.209 --> 51:13.376
See Her power!

51:13.709 --> 51:20.292
Flowers, this wood, different colors, fragrance

51:20.584 --> 51:27.417
so many things! Is one Mother Earth, is producing all this!

51:28.792 --> 51:31.833
Because She is Reality.

51:32.042 --> 51:36.792
It's the Reality in Her can produce.

51:38.125 --> 51:39.959
But unreal things,

51:40.167 --> 51:43.084
whatever you make out of unreal things,

51:43.292 --> 51:51.459
they may look real, but they are not.

51:53.668 --> 51:57.376
So now, let us have the puja.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.542
And for the rituals also He said,

52:00.709 --> 52:03.709
because most of them were unrealized souls in those days

52:04.000 --> 52:07.668
that they, whatever puja, they did was unreal, it was not real,

52:07.875 --> 52:13.750
had no meaning. It was giving no effect.

52:14.084 --> 52:16.709
You see, worshipping a person who is unreal

52:16.917 --> 52:18.417
or any Deity who is unreal

52:18.626 --> 52:20.292
or those who were not real people

52:20.501 --> 52:22.084
and the Realized Souls.

52:22.292 --> 52:24.417
What's the use of unrealized people worshipping Me?

52:24.626 --> 52:28.376
I mean I would not allow any unrealized person to worship Me at all.

52:28.626 --> 52:30.917
You see, I always tell people unless and until they are

52:31.125 --> 52:33.501
perfectly sahaja yogis, you know then they are good,

52:33.709 --> 52:35.000
please don't bring them for puja.

52:35.209 --> 52:37.875
Is troublesome to Me. Much more than to them.

52:38.084 --> 52:41.292
You see they also feel obliged as if, you see, they are obliging Me,

52:41.501 --> 52:43.334
they think so by worshipping Me. I don't know.

52:43.542 --> 52:45.251
But they don't know how much they are troubling Me,

52:45.459 --> 52:47.459
by coming here without Realisation.

52:47.668 --> 52:51.209
So the ones who haven't got Realisation are really troublesome.

52:51.417 --> 52:54.959
They don't help Me.

52:55.167 --> 53:00.875
So the myth some peple have that if they come to a puja

53:01.251 --> 53:06.459
before Realisation they'll get Realisation, is not good.

53:06.668 --> 53:09.917
You should not bring anyone who is not a Realized Soul

53:10.125 --> 53:11.959
or who is not a Sahaja Yogi to a puja here.

53:12.167 --> 53:15.917
It's troublesome and that person also starts doubting,this, that.

53:16.125 --> 53:17.292
Is better not to do such a thing.

53:17.501 --> 53:22.167
Because also such a person is half baked.

53:22.376 --> 53:25.750
So no use giving Me half baked cakes,

53:25.959 --> 53:28.668
and spoiling the half baked cake also permanently

53:28.875 --> 53:31.334
because if you take out a half baked cake, you see,

53:31.626 --> 53:32.959
it's spoilt for ever.

53:33.167 --> 53:36.417
I can't eat it nor you can bake it again.

53:36.709 --> 53:41.084
So what's the use of bringing somebody who is half baked?

53:41.292 --> 53:41.833
All right?

53:42.042 --> 53:46.000
So from next time, also this is out of compassion you do it,

53:46.251 --> 53:48.334
I know you do it out of compassion,

53:48.542 --> 53:53.833
but this is not wise.

53:54.042 --> 53:56.542
It doesn't help Me, nor it helps others. All right?

53:56.750 --> 54:00.709
So from next time also any time, you must find out a circular saying

54:00.917 --> 54:04.000
that unless and until you are sure about the Realisation of a person

54:04.209 --> 54:07.501
that he has got Realisation, you should not call them for the puja.

54:07.709 --> 54:11.167
They are not good for Mother and they are not good for themselves.

54:11.376 --> 54:15.209
Because they become, you see doubting or something, and

54:15.709 --> 54:18.334
you cannot really give them Realisation after that, it's very [hard].

54:18.542 --> 54:20.542
You remember your friend had the same problem

54:20.709 --> 54:23.833
who was he? Nick or something...

54:24.292 --> 54:24.792
All right.

54:25.251 --> 54:28.687
So now we can… Gavin, you can do the Ganesha Puja.
