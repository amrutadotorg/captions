00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:08.680
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:14.721
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:18.521
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:25.251
We all have heard about His birth

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:31.084
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:37.709
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:43.584
And then it was predicted

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.875
that a child will be born in your family

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:53.501
who will be either a great saint

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:57.875
or a very great King,

00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:01.875
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:06.459
is the ruler of the whole world.

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:11.917
So the father got worried,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:19.959
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:22.459
into material life

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.459
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.209
So he built a very special place for Him,

00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:35.125
a beautiful palace to live in.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:44.084
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.709
was a very, very beautiful woman,

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:49.668
gave HIm all the pleasures of life,

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:57.668
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.709
Also you know the story of His going

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:11.417
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:17.917
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:21.709
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.251
and ‘Why should people die?’.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.292
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:37.334
and He started trying to understand

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:40.709
why these things happen to human beings.

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:43.292
With this the enquiry started.

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:49.917
So He reached a point where

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:57.251
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.584
that were entangled around him by His father.

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:04.334
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:12.251
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.292
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.626
for the search of the truth because

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:28.042
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:35.709
And so He started from collective towards the center.

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:38.334
When we see miseries all around us,

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:41.209
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:43.251
Will everybody get realization?

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.501
Will everybody will have this, you see?

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.000
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:56.334
first of all we must know, are we all right?

00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:01.709
Have we - are we perfect?

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:04.750
Are we full of joy?

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.709
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:15.542
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.833
Because He started from the wrong point,

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:21.875
searching it from the collective

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:24.417
to remove the miseries of the people

00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:27.875
He had to go in a very round about way.

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:32.542
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:35.542
He went to big pundits,

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:42.417
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:49.209
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:56.709
that is the ‘roga’, is the

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:03.833
health or miserable physical body,

00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:09.542
then the death and the old age.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:13.501
He went and asked so many people

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:17.792
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:21.584
And then they said that you have to

00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:26.875
become old because you are born like that

00:05:27.334 --> 00:05:29.626
and you have to suffer

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.084
because you commit sins.

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:35.209
He was not satisfied with this answer.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:40.292
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:44.209
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

00:05:44.417 --> 00:05:50.542
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:54.792
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.125
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:07.209
because He got so tired of His seeking.

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:10.459
And after the sleep He got up

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.542
and suddenly He got His Realization.

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.209
And He thought the whole drama is over.

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:24.459
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:27.417
and She died just after the birth of the child.

00:06:27.626 --> 00:06:32.792
And He got His Realization.

00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:37.209
Now at that time when He got His Realization

00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:41.376
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:45.376
that what it means Realization is.

00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:46.750
Nobody to decode

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:52.875
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:57.209
But because of His tremendous seeking

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:01.959
and such ardent desire

00:07:02.376 --> 00:07:08.376
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:10.626
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:14.833
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:21.626
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:27.584
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:32.042
the need of the time had to act firstly,

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:39.000
secondly the need of the

00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:41.875
incarnation to come on this earth

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:46.501
was first created in the human beings.

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:51.668
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:55.750
Brahmanism or priesthood

00:07:55.959 --> 00:08:00.584
and people were trying to take everything

00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:05.750
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:13.125
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:17.626
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:19.833
the puja and everything He canceled.

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:22.334
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

00:08:22.584 --> 00:08:26.000
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:28.251
It's all a joke going on, you see.

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:34.167
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

00:08:34.376 --> 00:08:37.125
that the whole world is a leela,

00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:41.750
is a play of God's own whims.

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:43.709
So you just enjoy it.

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:50.709
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:52.626
which we had

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:57.209
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

00:08:57.417 --> 00:08:58.167
You were there?

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:00.501
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:03.084
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:06.584
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:10.501
So in the same way when Buddha came in

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:13.584
first problem was that

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:17.917
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

00:09:18.251 --> 00:09:21.501
Because in His search everybody told Him

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:25.584
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:30.042
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:32.750
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:35.042
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:38.042
“Where is the God?”

00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:42.833
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:47.084
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:50.542
and nothing unusual I should say.

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:53.959
So this must be done by God, you see.

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:55.501
If you cut your throat:

00:09:55.709 --> 00:10:00.750
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:05.125
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:08.459
Because everybody is going towards God.

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:11.292
Then the people whom He met they said,

00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:14.042
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:16.792
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.959
Because he could mesmerize people,

00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:23.125
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

00:10:23.334 --> 00:10:26.709
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:29.959
because people take God in the hand and use it

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:31.709
for their own purpose,

00:10:31.917 --> 00:10:36.376
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

00:10:36.584 --> 00:10:38.125
and it’s God has

00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:40.750
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:44.875
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

00:10:45.084 --> 00:10:48.626
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:52.417
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

00:10:52.626 --> 00:10:55.000
and just doing all these horrible things

00:10:55.334 --> 00:11:01.125
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:04.917
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:07.501
they shave it completely.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.376
And they have to -

00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:13.167
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

00:11:13.376 --> 00:11:15.792
some walls of the temple.

00:11:16.084 --> 00:11:18.792
And the ladies who shaved their heads

00:11:19.084 --> 00:11:22.334
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:26.917
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:29.584
and the water is poured on them.

00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:33.251
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:36.542
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

00:11:36.709 --> 00:11:39.084
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

00:11:39.292 --> 00:11:40.626
buckets after buckets.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:44.334
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:45.917
you see one is finished then another one.

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:47.833
Poor ladies rolling like that,

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:53.709
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:56.792
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.251
And then later on you see they became modern,

00:12:00.542 --> 00:12:04.376
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

00:12:04.584 --> 00:12:08.501
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:13.042
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:17.125
and they sent it to England and other places.

00:12:17.376 --> 00:12:22.251
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.750
ridiculous things were done!

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.959
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:30.376
The first step is Self-Realization.

00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:32.750
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:35.709
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:38.459
first you get your Realization.

00:12:38.668 --> 00:12:42.084
That was the first condition, establish it.

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:45.376
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

00:12:45.584 --> 00:12:46.542
- nothing doing.

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:54.167
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

00:12:54.417 --> 00:12:57.501
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

00:12:57.709 --> 00:12:59.584
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:02.084
So all that He started

00:13:02.292 --> 00:13:06.542
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

00:13:06.709 --> 00:13:11.251
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:15.000
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:18.334
means the one who is a Realized soul.

00:13:18.584 --> 00:13:22.376
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:25.750
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.292
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:36.251
You are all Buddhas because you know.

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:40.125
When you know, you are the Buddha.

00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:43.959
Now without going into all that nonsense

00:13:44.167 --> 00:13:48.917
of renunciation and shaving your head and wearing that dress

00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:51.584
and everything, you have achieved your Realization.

00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:55.459
It’s a short circuit or a short path.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:59.542
Why? Because He started from the other side.

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:05.542
But if He had started directly from Himself, you see,

00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:07.833
it would have been better.

00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:12.501
You see, in practical sense I'll tell you how it is.

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:19.709
Supposing you want to repair your house.

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:23.709
So you have to have instrument for that house.

00:14:24.292 --> 00:14:27.792
But supposing you are worried about all the houses of the world.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:33.167
and you start repairing, neither you'll repair other houses nor yours.

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:37.042
So first you must practice on yourself.

00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:41.542
Put your attention to yourself first.

00:14:41.709 --> 00:14:46.709
Is also is a method by which you avoid

00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:48.792
seeing the point,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.417
seeing the reality,

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:55.917
that, if you are not all right, how can you improve the whole world?

00:14:56.167 --> 00:14:59.750
So when your attention goes to other things, are

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:02.792
you must know that there’s something wrong with you first of all,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.417
which must be corrected.

00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:06.833
And that’s why

00:15:07.042 --> 00:15:10.042
it took Him so much time to go round and round and round.

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:12.959
He had to give up His wife, give up His family,

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:16.292
give up everything and get to Realization.

00:15:16.668 --> 00:15:19.167
Because by giving up everything He realized

00:15:19.417 --> 00:15:22.125
that it is He, who should achieve it.

00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:25.167
It's a very circuitous way,

00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:27.459
but you can just say: It doesn't exist anything,

00:15:27.668 --> 00:15:31.084
first let me get all right - that’s Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:36.668
Now what happened, that became a method for people to achieve God.

00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:42.125
Many people think that you must suffer like Christ to achieve God.

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:46.959
You must renounce the world then achieve God.

00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:51.501
Actually renouncing the world and all that is just a myth.

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:54.209
How do you renounce the world?

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:56.209
It’s myth. What are you renouncing?

00:15:56.417 --> 00:15:59.125
I mean in any case, you can’t carry this with you, can you?

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:03.542
I mean, can you even carry, I would say, even a thread?

00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:07.125
Nothing! When you come you come like this, you are born

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:10.459
with closed fists. When you go, the hands are like this open.

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:13.000
Have you ever seen a dead corpse?

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:15.542
He always has his hands like this. Nothing can he take,

00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:18.917
just going like this.

00:16:19.417 --> 00:16:21.542
So you don't take anything from here.

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:24.959
So this renouncing, this ‘I renounce that’, ‘I renounce that"

00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:29.626
'I’ll give up this’, ‘I’ll give up my wife’, ‘I’ll give up that",

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.668
has no meaning.

00:16:32.334 --> 00:16:36.376
Because it’s a state of mind in which your

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.584
being becomes -

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.626
I don't know the English word for that

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:47.917
which doesn't stick to something, what is it called?

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:56.668
I don't know. You see, any substance that doesn't stick to anything.

00:16:56.875 --> 00:17:00.542
I mean we have all kind of stick plast. Yogi: Unattached?

00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:03.334
Shri Mataji: No, but that quality.

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:09.084
There is a quality of the temperament, which doesn't stick to anything.

00:17:10.584 --> 00:17:13.542
Doesn't stick to anything, I mean you put it here, it will come out.

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:18.167
You can say the soap or something like that –

00:17:18.376 --> 00:17:21.334
Yogi: Like mercury. Mother, like mercury, just flows.

00:17:21.584 --> 00:17:23.709
Shri Mataji: Ah - like mercury.

00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:26.584
But mercury also you can apply sometimes,

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:29.792
you know with heat and, but this is something beyond mercury,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.417
is absolute, which doesn't stick to anything, you see.

00:17:34.626 --> 00:17:36.209
You just become like that.

00:17:36.417 --> 00:17:40.668
All you do, wear this, you wear that, you have this, all right.

00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:43.084
You are never stuck.

00:17:43.334 --> 00:17:48.251
Then name of the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’, ‘Nirmama’,

00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:51.417
that for Her nothing is Her own, you see,

00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:53.959
see, She doesn't stick to anything.

00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:57.709
She is in everything, but She doesn't stick to anything.

00:17:57.959 --> 00:18:00.459
For example now see the light here,

00:18:00.668 --> 00:18:06.251
it’s not sticking to anything, it exists by itself.

00:18:06.584 --> 00:18:08.668
It doesn’t stick to anything.

00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:11.709
This is the nearest you can say, it doesn't stick to anything.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.417
Any but thing tries to stick it gets burned, that’s a good idea.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.292
So this is what it is,

00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:25.750
this is called an enlightened person doesn't stick to anything.

00:18:26.292 --> 00:18:30.917
And whatever tries to come very close gets burnt off.

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:36.792
So, such a person is not attached to anything.

00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:39.792
But that’s not a mental thing that you can do

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.542
that, “Oh I am not attached to you”, you see.

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:44.917
It’s very common in this country especially, “I hate you”.

00:18:45.209 --> 00:18:47.668
Then you can't hate anyone. How can you?

00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:49.959
And nor can you love anyone because

00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:56.125
the attachment cannot give you both the qualities.

00:18:56.334 --> 00:19:00.251
You see, because you are attached to someone,

00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:04.709
you say that you hate, simultaneously you are loving that person.

00:19:04.917 --> 00:19:10.000
Because these are the dual qualities of attachment, see?

00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:13.584
So once you have attachment you have both things.

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:16.459
One moment you hate, another moment you love,

00:19:16.709 --> 00:19:17.959
another moment you hate,

00:19:18.167 --> 00:19:20.501
then you love and you don't know what's the matter with yourself.

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:25.334
But the thing is the quality of the mind is such that

00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:30.334
it is either getting attached mentally

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:33.833
or either getting detached mentally.

00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:40.251
But actually anybody say, you love someone very much.

00:19:40.542 --> 00:19:44.542
Now you don't even die together, whatever you may try.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.334
You cannot die together.

00:19:46.542 --> 00:19:49.501
One person has to die earlier, another has to die later.

00:19:50.209 --> 00:19:54.459
So the answer to His question that He asked was,

00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:56.709
“Why all these things are caused?”

00:19:56.917 --> 00:20:02.292
So he said, it is because of desire.

00:20:02.626 --> 00:20:07.542
Because of human desire, these are all problems are caused,

00:20:07.709 --> 00:20:14.542
like the death, like the old age

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.668
or the sickness, are caused by desire.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.833
Now see in Sahaja Yoga language how we should understand Him.

00:20:23.417 --> 00:20:28.792
Is the desire, as you know, is the left side.

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:34.542
Left side gives you death.

00:20:34.709 --> 00:20:39.251
When the left side is very much used

00:20:39.459 --> 00:20:43.417
you get to death, ultimately when it is exhausted.

00:20:43.668 --> 00:20:48.459
When the left side is out, desire,

00:20:48.668 --> 00:20:52.167
you also get sickness.

00:20:52.792 --> 00:21:00.626
And when the left side is used too much you get your old age.

00:21:01.334 --> 00:21:06.668
Of course the right side is the one which does it,

00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:09.875
but the left side is the originator.

00:21:10.084 --> 00:21:13.459
If you have no desire you won't go into the right side.

00:21:13.668 --> 00:21:18.209
First is the desire, the starting point is the desire.

00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:21.917
He reached the point all right, but He didn't clearly say

00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:25.668
what desire means: Desire means the left side.

00:21:25.959 --> 00:21:32.417
When we have the pure desire, which is the Kundalini,

00:21:32.668 --> 00:21:36.167
then all these things are neutralized.

00:21:37.209 --> 00:21:41.792
When the Kundalini rises the pure desire, the real desire,

00:21:42.042 --> 00:21:44.792
the only desire, it gives you the absolute

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.501
by which you don't get old,

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:53.334
you don’t die and you do not get sick.

00:21:53.542 --> 00:22:00.042
Because you achieve that which is eternal, it does not die.

00:22:00.292 --> 00:22:01.750
You become the Spirit.

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:04.334
When you want to die, you die.

00:22:04.584 --> 00:22:08.125
When you want to be reborn, you are reborn, and

00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:14.334
you have that realized temperament within you. It does not die.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.084
That's what you take with you.

00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:23.709
Now you take your Realization with you when you die.

00:22:24.542 --> 00:22:26.959
So what He tried to say was to build up

00:22:27.167 --> 00:22:30.334
that we should not have any desires.

00:22:30.542 --> 00:22:34.959
Now because, you see, His passage was like that, He went from

00:22:35.376 --> 00:22:38.584
one to another, giving up this desire, that desire, that desire,

00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:42.709
that desire - ultimately He came to Kundalini.

00:22:43.501 --> 00:22:46.833
There’s a saying, “Ya neti neti vachanair nigama avocham”

00:22:47.042 --> 00:22:48.042
When you go on saying:

00:22:48.251 --> 00:22:51.084
'Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this',

00:22:51.459 --> 00:22:53.875
then you go to a point, when you say “Then

00:22:54.334 --> 00:22:59.167
what ultimately left is the desire, which is the pure desire,

00:22:59.376 --> 00:23:01.750
the desire, that is the Kundalini.

00:23:02.084 --> 00:23:03.542
Say for example

00:23:03.709 --> 00:23:06.084
you say, “I’ll have a house -  no, no, I’ll not have a house,

00:23:06.292 --> 00:23:07.542
I’ll have a car, no, no car,no,

00:23:07.709 --> 00:23:11.209
I’ll not have a wife, I’ll not look at any woman.

00:23:11.417 --> 00:23:13.042
I’ll have nothing to do with it.

00:23:13.251 --> 00:23:17.042
I'll give up this, give up that, give up that, give up that.

00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:23.000
Till you reach a point where you are at an absolute point.

00:23:23.209 --> 00:23:25.875
And there you realize that the Kundalini rises.

00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:27.334
But I think it is going too far.

00:23:27.542 --> 00:23:30.334
Why not start from the Kundalini rising? There.

00:23:32.668 --> 00:23:33.750
Is a simple thing.

00:23:33.959 --> 00:23:37.084
So Sahaja Yoga is the other way round stuff,

00:23:37.292 --> 00:23:39.626
is that you better start from the Kundalini.

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:43.251
and neutralize all your left side.

00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:45.584
You see the point now?

00:23:45.792 --> 00:23:50.251
That's why Buddha was always regarded as an atheist.

00:23:50.584 --> 00:23:53.251
He was not. He was not an atheist.

00:23:53.459 --> 00:23:56.292
But as a matter of policy,

00:23:57.167 --> 00:24:00.251
He and Mahavira -they were contemporary -

00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:06.917
they decided: Let's not have the name of God anywhere near,

00:24:07.292 --> 00:24:09.709
because once you start the god business,

00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:15.251
big philosophies are built and people just start claiming it.

00:24:15.542 --> 00:24:17.042
I mean, they become that!

00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:22.209
Actually anybody who reads Geeta becomes a sort of a Krishna,

00:24:22.459 --> 00:24:24.209
Shri Krishna Himself, it’s the way he talks,

00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:27.417
people - you can be shocked the way they talk I mean

00:24:27.626 --> 00:24:30.501
they are Shri Krishna, giving an advice to Arjuna, you know,

00:24:30.709 --> 00:24:32.459
sitting on a chariot.

00:24:32.668 --> 00:24:35.792
They behave in that manner, you know their style is like that.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
I met one fellow called Chinmayanand

00:24:39.251 --> 00:24:42.584
and I was amazed you know the way he was talking,  I was surprised,

00:24:42.792 --> 00:24:45.084
I mean he was just behaving like Shri Krishna,

00:24:45.292 --> 00:24:46.833
of course horrid looking,

00:24:47.042 --> 00:24:51.542
but, he thought he was Shri Krishna himself, you see.

00:24:51.709 --> 00:24:54.584
So that's what identification takes place with human beings

00:24:54.792 --> 00:24:57.501
when they start talking about God or His ways and others.

00:24:57.709 --> 00:24:59.542
So He said: "All right put that out,

00:24:59.709 --> 00:25:03.042
just talk about Self-Realization. That's the first step."

00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:07.501
And Mahavira joined hands with Him.

00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:10.209
It helped that time very much,

00:25:10.501 --> 00:25:14.376
to all the people who were in the name of ritualism you see,

00:25:14.584 --> 00:25:16.750
they would say, “It’s very difficult, you know,

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:20.167
Hinduism is the most difficult thing."

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:25.000
You have to fast on Sunday, because of the sun,

00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:27.833
Monday because of the moon,

00:25:28.042 --> 00:25:31.750
Tuesday because of the Mars. Like that went on and on,

00:25:31.959 --> 00:25:35.959
and when do you eat your food?

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:40.042
If you have to achieve God then you have to

00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:44.125
take your bath at four o’clock and do this and do that and

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:47.750
shave your head and then you become a sanyasi,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.167
and you can't eat this and you can't eat that,

00:25:51.376 --> 00:25:55.209
and you can't do that - all those things ritualistic they started.

00:25:55.584 --> 00:25:59.542
But He felt that supposing if you take to sanyasa,

00:25:59.709 --> 00:26:03.209
so half of your desires are finished, you are a sanyasi,

00:26:03.417 --> 00:26:06.292
you are doing God's work

00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:09.125
and there is no need to have a family or anything,

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:11.251
so half of your desires are finished.

00:26:11.459 --> 00:26:14.376
If you have a family then you want to do something for the family,

00:26:14.584 --> 00:26:17.875
you have to look after your family and all that is to be done.

00:26:18.125 --> 00:26:23.501
But He did not realize that He was a Realized soul, others were not.

00:26:23.709 --> 00:26:29.542
You see, if a realized soul does that, it has no difference to him;

00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:31.292
whether he has a family or no family

00:26:31.501 --> 00:26:32.833
makes no difference to a realized soul,

00:26:33.042 --> 00:26:34.334
because he is not attached.

00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:39.167
But to a person who is not a realized soul,

00:26:39.417 --> 00:26:42.584
supposing he’ll give up his car, he’ll give up his house,

00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:44.459
go to the Himalayas.

00:26:44.668 --> 00:26:45.668
There, what he’ll do?

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:52.334
He’ll have a hut and have a barbed thing around or so.

00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:56.292
Then he may think of a Georgian style of a house

00:26:56.501 --> 00:26:59.542
if he's an English man,

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.875
because according to them Georgian style is unpretentious,

00:27:04.084 --> 00:27:07.668
so we can have, after all we are sanyasis!

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:09.084
That’s typical!

00:27:09.292 --> 00:27:14.833
I tell you all our western mind is behaving in that way, if you see,

00:27:15.084 --> 00:27:18.000
that we should be unpretentious, you see, it’s very fussy,

00:27:18.292 --> 00:27:19.334
is the word they will use.

00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:22.750
If you put even a little [thing]: "Oh it’s very fussy."

00:27:22.959 --> 00:27:26.709
They want everything to be plain, blunt, you see?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.459
But what about inside? I’s filled with what?

00:27:32.668 --> 00:27:37.000
All bottled up with all kinds of rums, this, that.

00:27:37.251 --> 00:27:41.833
But the outside should be absolutely blunt, you know.

00:27:42.042 --> 00:27:43.833
The food should not be,

00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:47.125
if possible just get it in its natural form.

00:27:47.334 --> 00:27:50.542
If not, don’t have any taste in it.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.626
It should be so blunt that

00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:56.334
any guest who comes to your house must starve, you see.

00:27:56.542 --> 00:28:01.084
All these funny ideas cropped up in that - of asceticism.

00:28:01.334 --> 00:28:03.542
Then we have other people like Shamballas.

00:28:03.709 --> 00:28:06.125
who are going now to Gobi desert.

00:28:06.334 --> 00:28:09.000
You see, they thought that this desert is not sufficient,

00:28:09.209 --> 00:28:10.417
let’s go to Gobi desert.

00:28:10.626 --> 00:28:12.417
So they are going now to Gobi desert.

00:28:12.626 --> 00:28:14.959
All these absurd ideas

00:28:15.167 --> 00:28:19.668
came out of Buddhism, and also Jainism.

00:28:19.875 --> 00:28:23.209
Jainis went to the other extreme in vegetarianism,

00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:28.292
because Buddha Himself was not a vegetarian, do you know that?

00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:33.334
He was not Himself a vegetarian, nor was Mahavira.

00:28:33.542 --> 00:28:39.750
You will be surprised: Vegetarianism for them was a philosophy.

00:28:39.959 --> 00:28:46.833
It was not a sort of a thing where you don't eat meat and all,

00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:52.125
because Buddha Himself died when He went to one of His disciples

00:28:52.334 --> 00:29:00.334
who was a ‘shikari’ – hunter.

00:29:00.709 --> 00:29:04.709
And the hunter had killed a wild boar.

00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:08.584
And he said that the wild boar has been killed just now

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:14.668
and it will take some time to cook, it’s rather half done, you see.

00:29:14.917 --> 00:29:18.542
I mean, He beeing an Indian, He could not eat that half done thing

00:29:18.709 --> 00:29:25.125
and He got diseased of, I think, this liver or something got

00:29:25.417 --> 00:29:28.084
into problem and He died of that, you see.

00:29:28.334 --> 00:29:31.000
I mean, I can't eat half done food Myself.

00:29:31.209 --> 00:29:33.959
"This is half done now." Half done is a horrible stuff,

00:29:34.167 --> 00:29:36.376
but we eat because it is unpretentious, you see

00:29:36.709 --> 00:29:37.875
or some sort of a thing.

00:29:38.084 --> 00:29:42.875
People have idea it’s not, it’s very next to the nature, you see.

00:29:43.084 --> 00:29:46.334
This is what is coming. But it’s all deliberate.

00:29:46.626 --> 00:29:48.584
You are attached inside.

00:29:48.792 --> 00:29:52.417
Outside, if you behave like that you are not going to become that.

00:29:52.626 --> 00:29:58.084
Like Hippies have an idea, if they live like primitive people,

00:29:58.292 --> 00:30:02.542
then they become primitive. You cannot, your brain is modern.

00:30:02.709 --> 00:30:05.833
Just by living, you see, wearing a wig like a hippy,

00:30:06.042 --> 00:30:07.501
can I become primitive?

00:30:07.709 --> 00:30:10.084
I cannot, My brain is modern, you see?

00:30:10.292 --> 00:30:14.417
That’s what people don't understand, that we are too deliberate.

00:30:14.626 --> 00:30:17.709
And all these deliberations can be only reduced

00:30:17.917 --> 00:30:22.292
if your Self comes into your attention.

00:30:22.501 --> 00:30:27.376
Otherwise all these are just our mental projections.

00:30:27.584 --> 00:30:32.376
So all these sanyasa and all these ideas came gradually,

00:30:32.584 --> 00:30:35.125
everyone who came on this Earth,

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:38.917
people have really made a mess out of them.

00:30:39.125 --> 00:30:42.792
And Buddha's mess has gone to such an extent

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.417
that if you see that you’ll be shocked.

00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:49.709
It went into many formations.

00:30:49.959 --> 00:30:51.792
But I heard from My son-in-law that

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.209
he went and visited some of the caves

00:30:54.417 --> 00:30:57.833
where the very early Buddhist lived, very early Buddhist lived.

00:30:58.042 --> 00:31:01.709
In the caves, because they were not supported by kings or anything,

00:31:01.917 --> 00:31:03.875
so they had a very bad time.

00:31:04.084 --> 00:31:05.833
And they used to live in the caves.

00:31:06.042 --> 00:31:11.334
And what My son-in-law told Me that in the caves there are writings

00:31:11.584 --> 00:31:16.167
in Sanskrit, in Pali and in Indian script,

00:31:16.417 --> 00:31:19.959
saying that it is the spontaneous happening

00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:23.709
that can bring forth the Self-Realization.

00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:28.084
He has got that photographed.

00:31:28.417 --> 00:31:31.875
So it’s coming forward. You see, so they knew about it,

00:31:32.084 --> 00:31:35.251
the Sahaja Yoga, they knew about it.

00:31:35.459 --> 00:31:38.501
But then as every religion has gone into a mess

00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:44.501
and lot of funny sort of, we can say the -

00:31:44.709 --> 00:31:50.209
funny sort of expressions, also Buddhism has gone,

00:31:50.417 --> 00:31:54.459
it became Mahayan, Hinayan, all sorts of things.

00:31:54.668 --> 00:32:00.000
But one of them was called as Vidhitama,

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:03.917
who ran away from India, settled down in Japan

00:32:04.209 --> 00:32:07.209
and he started the Zen system of religion,

00:32:07.417 --> 00:32:10.167
which he kept to the spontaneous happening.

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:12.959
That one was preserved.

00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:18.875
Another was the Lao Tse style, who did not talk of God

00:32:19.084 --> 00:32:22.417
and of Buddha, but of Tao itself -

00:32:22.626 --> 00:32:26.833
the energy or we can say about the Adishakti.

00:32:27.042 --> 00:32:30.209
So these two good things came out of Him.

00:32:30.417 --> 00:32:35.542
While they searched back into the history of China

00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:38.251
and they found out the Adishakti

00:32:38.459 --> 00:32:42.417
lived many years back there as Kuan Yin.

00:32:42.668 --> 00:32:46.584
And that’s how Kuan Yin was established

00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:50.501
as a Goddess for many Buddhists.

00:32:50.709 --> 00:32:55.167
Now then Buddha also got

00:32:55.376 --> 00:32:58.459
into another form because

00:32:58.709 --> 00:33:01.542
there was a big competition between Hinduism,

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:05.959
Hindus of those days and the Buddhists.

00:33:06.167 --> 00:33:07.959
So they wanted to form,

00:33:08.167 --> 00:33:11.709
for ordinary people it’s very difficult to understand the philosophy

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.125
so they thought that we should have Buddha expressed

00:33:16.334 --> 00:33:19.875
as He has been and He will be.

00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:25.875
So they formed their, you see, as you see He is a Matreya

00:33:26.084 --> 00:33:28.668
is going to come, the future Buddha is Bodhisatva

00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:31.501
and they started making His statues and everything.

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:34.334
So they made Buddha as the God.

00:33:34.584 --> 00:33:40.626
They started using Him to represent the Divine Power,

00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:44.084
giving Him forms and things and like hat many things happened.

00:33:44.292 --> 00:33:47.709
But Buddha Himself was so much frightened of the ritualism

00:33:47.917 --> 00:33:51.042
that He said, “You should not worship anything,

00:33:51.251 --> 00:33:53.584
you should not build any temples

00:33:53.875 --> 00:33:55.833
so you see the loophole was found out,

00:33:56.042 --> 00:33:59.292
if temples are not to be built, we’ll build stupas.

00:33:59.709 --> 00:34:05.000
Now in the Stupas they put the tooth of Buddha,

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.833
of course that was sensible to do I must say,

00:34:08.167 --> 00:34:10.292
but of course Buddha had said not to do it.

00:34:10.501 --> 00:34:12.709
And they put it there, He had two disciples,

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:15.251
called as Sariputta and Moggallana.

00:34:15.459 --> 00:34:17.792
They were very good disciples of His

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.542
and their bones were collected after they were burnt out

00:34:22.709 --> 00:34:25.292
and were put in the stupa.

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:28.584
That was something definitely sensible to put them there.

00:34:28.792 --> 00:34:31.626
Of course the bones and all these things should not be disturbed

00:34:31.833 --> 00:34:34.584
because it’s not good, it creates a problem for the body.

00:34:34.792 --> 00:34:39.334
But at least if they have put it there in the Mother Earth

00:34:39.542 --> 00:34:42.542
it would have been all right. but they put it in caskets.

00:34:42.709 --> 00:34:45.709
Now the first casket was made of gold,

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:50.334
the second of silver, the third of iron,

00:34:50.542 --> 00:34:54.459
the fourth one of wood sort of a thing, mummified those things.

00:34:54.709 --> 00:34:56.959
That was a very wrong thing to do, because

00:34:57.167 --> 00:34:59.376
because if you go on keeping like that,

00:34:59.584 --> 00:35:01.542
some parts of the body of these great people,

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:09.167
it can hamper their rebirth or their body

00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:12.084
which they want to again incarnate, you see.

00:35:12.292 --> 00:35:14.709
But hair is all right or nails are all right,

00:35:14.917 --> 00:35:17.833
but you shouldn’t keep the part of dead body like that.

00:35:18.042 --> 00:35:22.917
And this kind of thing gave another nonsensical ideas to

00:35:23.292 --> 00:35:25.125
to horrible human beeings.

00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:30.000
What they did, that they thought that if we have to keep some part

00:35:30.334 --> 00:35:33.417
of the person who died like divine person,

00:35:33.626 --> 00:35:37.376
why not we cut the hand of someone and like that.

00:35:37.584 --> 00:35:43.292
So in Tibet and all these places, specially in Ladhak, you see,

00:35:43.542 --> 00:35:46.875
they used to cut the hands of the people when they died

00:35:47.084 --> 00:35:48.709
and big ritual for the dead

00:35:48.917 --> 00:35:51.167
and then they started going towards the dead.

00:35:51.376 --> 00:35:54.875
So they started moving towards the left side.

00:35:55.084 --> 00:35:58.334
Most of the Buddhists moved to the left side,

00:35:58.542 --> 00:36:04.251
which was absolutely prohibited by Buddha,

00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:07.709
because He is on the right side.

00:36:07.917 --> 00:36:14.501
He said, “Cut down your desires, do the karmas without the desire”.

00:36:14.709 --> 00:36:16.042
This was His idea.

00:36:16.251 --> 00:36:20.542
Activate your right side without the desire.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.376
This was His philosophy.

00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:26.584
But they - all of them are left sided.

00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:30.709
They have desires, not only desires

00:36:30.917 --> 00:36:34.626
but whatever they do they do it out of desire.

00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:39.376
Like the worst is like the Japanese,

00:36:39.626 --> 00:36:43.792
they think that you can

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.334
commit suicide in the name of your nation.

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:55.709
With this desire they will commit suicide.

00:36:56.084 --> 00:36:58.167
To save their country they can commit suicide.

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:00.334
I mean it is absurd.

00:37:00.542 --> 00:37:04.084
He said, “Whatever you have to do, do without the desire”,

00:37:04.292 --> 00:37:05.875
which is a difficult thing for human beings.

00:37:06.084 --> 00:37:09.792
How many there are who are doing it without desire?

00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:13.542
And whatever we do, we do out of desire.

00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:16.000
Even at the subtler point.

00:37:16.251 --> 00:37:17.668
Even when we do puja,

00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:22.875
we do with the desire that our vibrations will improve.

00:37:23.084 --> 00:37:27.709
Can we think of a state where it is absolutely desireless?

00:37:28.042 --> 00:37:34.709
Only one person has that, there’s no desire, desireless.

00:37:34.917 --> 00:37:37.209
The whole thing is done without any desire,

00:37:37.417 --> 00:37:39.542
so there is no disappointment.

00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:42.167
There is no unhappiness.

00:37:42.376 --> 00:37:43.668
You are going to America,

00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:49.709
knowingly that is going to be a horrible experience,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.750
but it’s a joke, just going to see the joke.

00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:56.292
Without any hope,

00:37:56.626 --> 00:38:01.334
maybe it might work out to be something tremendous,

00:38:01.542 --> 00:38:03.084
but no desires.

00:38:03.292 --> 00:38:07.542
You see, it’s so desireless the whole personality is,

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.459
that even if I have to desire for something

00:38:09.668 --> 00:38:11.000
I have to ask you, "You better desire!",

00:38:11.209 --> 00:38:13.709
because I have lost the sense of desire.

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:17.125
So many times I’ve said you better do it for Me.

00:38:17.334 --> 00:38:20.709
Unless and until you pray to Me I can't do it.

00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:22.917
That's why I asked you write to Me a letter,

00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:24.376
because you see, I can't desire,

00:38:24.584 --> 00:38:26.251
i really don't. I don't do anything!

00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:29.542
Without doing anything it is happening. So why should I desire?

00:38:29.709 --> 00:38:33.376
I really don't do anything.

00:38:33.668 --> 00:38:36.542
You'll be amazed, I don't do anything, I don't desire anything,

00:38:36.709 --> 00:38:38.626
nothing of the kind, it’s working I am just watching.

00:38:38.833 --> 00:38:39.626
Still you are saying,

00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:45.750
“Mother you aredoing it.” I'm quite surprised!

00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:47.833
That is Tao.

00:38:48.042 --> 00:38:49.459
If you read about Tao,

00:38:49.709 --> 00:38:52.792
it is said that it doesn’t do anything.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.959
But everything works out.

00:38:57.167 --> 00:39:00.251
So this is what He said, which was all sahaja,

00:39:00.459 --> 00:39:02.833
that you have to be desireless

00:39:03.042 --> 00:39:05.668
and do everything,

00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:11.000
and He is the one who controls our ego.

00:39:11.209 --> 00:39:16.251
Because if you have no desire you will have no ego either.

00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:18.626
Ego is only built up

00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:22.334
when you have a desire to do something.

00:39:22.542 --> 00:39:27.334
That is you just do it for fun, just for joy, just for doing it.

00:39:27.542 --> 00:39:29.875
Then how will you build up ego? You cannot.

00:39:30.084 --> 00:39:33.959
Like an artist is painting just for fun and throwing it away.

00:39:34.209 --> 00:39:38.292
Creating something just for fun – that’s what God is.

00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:40.792
Not with the desire to achieve something.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.875
I mean the desire is so gross, can be extremely gross.

00:39:44.209 --> 00:39:47.376
It can become subtler and subtler and subtler. That’s a good way.

00:39:47.709 --> 00:39:51.084
But can be very, very gross also,

00:39:51.292 --> 00:39:54.501
like some people can believe that, you see,

00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:59.334
“I should painting, because I'll get so much money."

00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:02.292
Or "I can sell it to somebody

00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:06.042
who may be the worst man, but I’ll sell it because I can get more money.”

00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:08.833
That’s absolutely the grossest of all, you see.

00:40:09.042 --> 00:40:12.626
That you can go to the most sinful things, I mean, I don’t know,

00:40:12.833 --> 00:40:15.459
there can be even worse desires than that,

00:40:15.709 --> 00:40:17.084
can be very many.

00:40:17.292 --> 00:40:19.792
But on this auspicious day we should not think of them

00:40:20.042 --> 00:40:24.125
which are there like that, but minimum of minimum,

00:40:24.334 --> 00:40:30.167
if you come, just do your puja, just for the joy of it,

00:40:30.792 --> 00:40:33.501
not with any desires.

00:40:33.917 --> 00:40:35.709
Just for the joy of it.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.251
I mean we are doing so many things like that.

00:40:38.459 --> 00:40:42.584
For example, we enjoy each other’s company.

00:40:42.792 --> 00:40:44.709
Just, just think of that!

00:40:44.917 --> 00:40:47.292
We all Sahaja Yogis are enjoying each other’s company,

00:40:47.542 --> 00:40:51.084
what’s this for? Nothing at all. There’s no, nothing.

00:40:52.417 --> 00:40:55.459
Just, you are enjoying it without any desire.

00:40:55.709 --> 00:41:00.875
Just say, for enjoyment’s sake, enjoyment.

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:04.292
When that purity comes, you see in our temperament,

00:41:04.584 --> 00:41:07.501
that we do everything without any desire,

00:41:07.792 --> 00:41:10.917
we have got rid of all the ego.

00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:12.709
The Buddha is awakened within us.

00:41:12.917 --> 00:41:15.376
And that’s what is the importance of Buddha,

00:41:15.584 --> 00:41:17.584
that He settled down Himself

00:41:17.792 --> 00:41:20.501
in a place which is the most difficult place,

00:41:20.875 --> 00:41:23.792
that is on the left side of your head, you see.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.334
Sometimes I've seen it projects here up to this point, you know,

00:41:27.542 --> 00:41:30.501
in some people they get such a terrible pain, you know,

00:41:30.709 --> 00:41:33.542
pulling it out from there, can't imagine.

00:41:33.709 --> 00:41:39.125
So this horrible point which is  -

00:41:39.417 --> 00:41:43.167
so funny it is, sometimes it can blow up like that, you see,

00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:46.626
sometimes it can pierce through. It’s a horrible one

00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:49.792
which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.167
and it takes it forms in different ways and methods.

00:41:53.417 --> 00:41:58.833
For that we have to say, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

00:41:59.042 --> 00:42:03.417
means: We surrender ourselves to Buddha.

00:42:04.334 --> 00:42:07.042
Then what does He say? The second one is very good:

00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:10.042
‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’:

00:42:10.292 --> 00:42:13.042
I surrender myself to collectivity, ‘sangham’.

00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:15.542
‘Sangha’ is the collectivity.

00:42:15.709 --> 00:42:19.334
I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.

00:42:19.626 --> 00:42:22.584
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity,

00:42:22.792 --> 00:42:24.251
which is the enlightenment,

00:42:24.459 --> 00:42:28.709
you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha.”

00:42:29.084 --> 00:42:33.833
Secondly you say: “I surrender myself to collectivity.”

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:37.709
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

00:42:38.792 --> 00:42:41.417
So, ‘I surrender myself to collectivity’,

00:42:41.626 --> 00:42:49.626
so we say: “Sangham Sharanam Gachhami.”

00:42:50.875 --> 00:42:57.042
It is to Virat we are doing.

00:42:57.251 --> 00:43:00.042
What is the third one, is? "BuddhamSharanam Gachhami",

00:43:00.251 --> 00:43:03.792
"Sangham Sharanam Gachhami", the third one -

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.376
‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

00:43:05.584 --> 00:43:07.875
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami. ‘Dhammam’ means

00:43:08.125 --> 00:43:10.334
the religion - the balance.

00:43:10.542 --> 00:43:14.542
I surrender myself to religion, which is  essence of you,

00:43:14.709 --> 00:43:16.709
or you can put it the other way round,

00:43:16.959 --> 00:43:21.917
that, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami, Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami,

00:43:22.125 --> 00:43:23.542
Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:27.875
That's all. If you have achieved it then we can talk of God.

00:43:28.167 --> 00:43:32.167
Not before that.

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:34.668
So these three things are to be achieved.

00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:37.167
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this:

00:43:37.417 --> 00:43:41.459
First of all: ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

00:43:41.709 --> 00:43:47.542
‘I surrender myself to my virtues’.

00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:50.125
All desires can be surrendered to a virtue.

00:43:50.542 --> 00:43:53.501
Is it virtuous to do like this?

00:43:53.709 --> 00:43:56.251
You can, if you are brought up that way you’ll just not do it.

00:43:56.459 --> 00:43:57.875
You'll have no desires to do something,

00:43:58.084 --> 00:44:00.084
that is not virtuous and righteous.

00:44:00.292 --> 00:44:01.917
You will just not do it.

00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:05.125
So, ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’.

00:44:05.334 --> 00:44:08.167
Then you should say, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami’, means:

00:44:08.376 --> 00:44:10.709
I surrender myself to my enlightenment.

00:44:10.917 --> 00:44:13.875
This is the second state, when you are ascended.

00:44:14.084 --> 00:44:18.959
Surrender myself to enlightenment.

00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:22.792
Enlightenment that I've got to my Spirit.

00:44:23.125 --> 00:44:25.209
Is the Spirit who is going to guide you.

00:44:25.417 --> 00:44:30.584
No more my physical, mental, emotional nonsensical temptations.

00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:33.501
But what? Is the Spirit?

00:44:33.917 --> 00:44:37.668
And thirdly: ‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’, to the collectivity,

00:44:38.084 --> 00:44:41.334
to the whole, to the Virat.

00:44:41.542 --> 00:44:44.334
This is the way we have to work it out.

00:44:44.542 --> 00:44:47.042
So ultimately he reached the same point,

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:50.792
that let me start it from myself.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.668
It's from myself to others, not from others to myself.

00:44:55.875 --> 00:45:00.376
Is like treating the tree from outside, not from the roots.

00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:03.668
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:06.875
First you get your Realization,all right,

00:45:07.084 --> 00:45:13.875
then you learn how to surrender yourself to your Dharma.

00:45:14.125 --> 00:45:18.626
Then you become collectively conscious.

00:45:18.833 --> 00:45:21.917
Collectivity is a temperament,

00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:28.459
is a sense of enjoyment that you get in the collective living.

00:45:28.833 --> 00:45:36.792
Unless and until you have that you have not achieved your joy.

00:45:38.709 --> 00:45:44.750
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives

00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:49.709
and He is a very great powerful force within us.

00:45:50.125 --> 00:45:56.459
I’m very happy that Buddha Jayanti has fallen here in England,

00:45:56.668 --> 00:46:00.417
because as we say the England is the Heart of the universe -

00:46:00.626 --> 00:46:05.042
it doesn't matter if I say here, is any Arab here?

00:46:06.209 --> 00:46:10.125
I don't want to displease any Arab people sitting here.

00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:15.584
All right. And if it is the heart

00:46:15.792 --> 00:46:21.251
whatever you do here will circulate in the whole universe.

00:46:21.542 --> 00:46:24.376
So if you can conquer your ego here,

00:46:24.584 --> 00:46:30.209
you can even conquer the ego of Mister Reagan and these Russians.

00:46:30.417 --> 00:46:33.334
You can manage that. But first start it here.

00:46:33.584 --> 00:46:35.542
It has to reverse back you see, now

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:41.376
they have to learn from you and you don’t learn from them.

00:46:41.792 --> 00:46:47.668
When it will work out you’ll be amazed.

00:46:47.917 --> 00:46:52.042
Ego is the only problem I always face reaching their hearts.

00:46:52.417 --> 00:46:56.542
If ego is removed everything will be all right.

00:46:56.709 --> 00:47:02.417
So for us the great mantra is "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami".

00:47:02.833 --> 00:47:07.459
These three mantras you must say everyday I think,

00:47:07.668 --> 00:47:12.792
to get rid of this horrible ego.

00:47:13.042 --> 00:47:15.417
Now, any questions on Buddha you have?

00:47:15.668 --> 00:47:23.626
I've made it in a short way – the whole life it is very difficult.

00:47:37.833 --> 00:47:44.125
It’s receding - ego.

00:47:51.292 --> 00:47:53.833
English are wise people, sound people,

00:47:54.042 --> 00:47:55.251
and they must understand this, that

00:47:55.459 --> 00:47:57.292
is a very, very important thing

00:47:57.501 --> 00:48:00.334
that they should not loose these qualities

00:48:00.542 --> 00:48:04.875
and should try to fix their enlightenment

00:48:05.084 --> 00:48:10.292
in such a way that it circulates.

00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:28.501
Any question?

00:48:31.626 --> 00:48:34.209
Gavin told Me yesterday it is Buddha Jayanti. I was very happy,

00:48:34.417 --> 00:48:36.668
because in England I've not talked of Buddha

00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:41.709
but otherwise I have talked about Him elsewhere.

00:49:16.125 --> 00:49:23.125
So now, that's why I wore, you see, a Buddha's shawl

00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:31.459
because it is suggesting of a detached mind

00:49:32.167 --> 00:49:36.167
which has no color.

00:49:36.501 --> 00:49:40.417
And

00:49:41.709 --> 00:49:47.792
there could be a personality which is colourless.

00:49:49.251 --> 00:49:57.209
but you can have it covered with colours to make others happy.

00:50:00.251 --> 00:50:05.792
So when you are a Realized Soul, whatever you do is natural.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.125
Whatever you do.

00:50:07.334 --> 00:50:09.334
If I am wearing this, now I am a Buddha.

00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:12.792
When I take it out, I'm Adi Shakti.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.209
Is not a drama, is a fact.

00:50:18.417 --> 00:50:23.668
But if you are not a realized soul, before that whatever you do it’s just a drama.

00:50:26.084 --> 00:50:28.334
For example, this is an artificial thing,

00:50:28.542 --> 00:50:30.917
I put My hand there anything, nothing will burn.

00:50:31.125 --> 00:50:33.875
But if it is real, it will definitely burn, whatever I may try.

00:50:34.084 --> 00:50:36.084
It's like that.

00:50:40.709 --> 00:50:43.209
So if somebody is a real person

00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:46.084
whatever he does is not a drama,

00:50:46.292 --> 00:50:48.292
is reality.

00:50:49.709 --> 00:50:51.000
That's how they say

00:50:51.209 --> 00:50:53.917
that She can take this form, She can take thav form

00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:55.750
people don't understand, how can

00:50:55.959 --> 00:50:58.584
one person take so forms. Can.

00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:01.542
if it is Reality, it can.

00:51:01.709 --> 00:51:04.167
Like the Mother Earh, She is a Reality,

00:51:04.417 --> 00:51:08.584
and the sap that is coming from the Mother Earth

00:51:08.792 --> 00:51:10.959
takes so many forms.

00:51:11.209 --> 00:51:13.376
See Her power!

00:51:13.709 --> 00:51:20.292
Flowers, this wood, different colors, fragrance

00:51:20.584 --> 00:51:27.417
so many things! Is one Mother Earth, is producing all this!

00:51:28.792 --> 00:51:31.833
Because She is Reality.

00:51:32.042 --> 00:51:36.792
It's the Reality in Her can produce.

00:51:38.125 --> 00:51:39.959
But unreal things,

00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:43.084
whatever you make out of unreal things,

00:51:43.292 --> 00:51:51.459
they may look real, but they are not.

00:51:53.668 --> 00:51:57.376
So now, let us have the puja.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.542
And for the rituals also He said,

00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:03.709
because most of them were unrealized souls in those days

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.668
that they, whatever puja, they did was unreal, it was not real,

00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:13.750
had no meaning. It was giving no effect.

00:52:14.084 --> 00:52:16.709
You see, worshipping a person who is unreal

00:52:16.917 --> 00:52:18.417
or any Deity who is unreal

00:52:18.626 --> 00:52:20.292
or those who were not real people

00:52:20.501 --> 00:52:22.084
and the Realized Souls.

00:52:22.292 --> 00:52:24.417
What's the use of unrealized people worshipping Me?

00:52:24.626 --> 00:52:28.376
I mean I would not allow any unrealized person to worship Me at all.

00:52:28.626 --> 00:52:30.917
You see, I always tell people unless and until they are

00:52:31.125 --> 00:52:33.501
perfectly sahaja yogis, you know then they are good,

00:52:33.709 --> 00:52:35.000
please don't bring them for puja.

00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:37.875
Is troublesome to Me. Much more than to them.

00:52:38.084 --> 00:52:41.292
You see they also feel obliged as if, you see, they are obliging Me,

00:52:41.501 --> 00:52:43.334
they think so by worshipping Me. I don't know.

00:52:43.542 --> 00:52:45.251
But they don't know how much they are troubling Me,

00:52:45.459 --> 00:52:47.459
by coming here without Realisation.

00:52:47.668 --> 00:52:51.209
So the ones who haven't got Realisation are really troublesome.

00:52:51.417 --> 00:52:54.959
They don't help Me.

00:52:55.167 --> 00:53:00.875
So the myth some peple have that if they come to a puja

00:53:01.251 --> 00:53:06.459
before Realisation they'll get Realisation, is not good.

00:53:06.668 --> 00:53:09.917
You should not bring anyone who is not a Realized Soul

00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:11.959
or who is not a Sahaja Yogi to a puja here.

00:53:12.167 --> 00:53:15.917
It's troublesome and that person also starts doubting,this, that.

00:53:16.125 --> 00:53:17.292
Is better not to do such a thing.

00:53:17.501 --> 00:53:22.167
Because also such a person is half baked.

00:53:22.376 --> 00:53:25.750
So no use giving Me half baked cakes,

00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:28.668
and spoiling the half baked cake also permanently

00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:31.334
because if you take out a half baked cake, you see,

00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:32.959
it's spoilt for ever.

00:53:33.167 --> 00:53:36.417
I can't eat it nor you can bake it again.

00:53:36.709 --> 00:53:41.084
So what's the use of bringing somebody who is half baked?

00:53:41.292 --> 00:53:41.833
All right?

00:53:42.042 --> 00:53:46.000
So from next time, also this is out of compassion you do it,

00:53:46.251 --> 00:53:48.334
I know you do it out of compassion,

00:53:48.542 --> 00:53:53.833
but this is not wise.

00:53:54.042 --> 00:53:56.542
It doesn't help Me, nor it helps others. All right?

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:00.709
So from next time also any time, you must find out a circular saying

00:54:00.917 --> 00:54:04.000
that unless and until you are sure about the Realisation of a person

00:54:04.209 --> 00:54:07.501
that he has got Realisation, you should not call them for the puja.

00:54:07.709 --> 00:54:11.167
They are not good for Mother and they are not good for themselves.

00:54:11.376 --> 00:54:15.209
Because they become, you see doubting or something, and

00:54:15.709 --> 00:54:18.334
you cannot really give them Realisation after that, it's very [hard].

00:54:18.542 --> 00:54:20.542
You remember your friend had the same problem

00:54:20.709 --> 00:54:23.833
who was he? Nick or something...

00:54:24.292 --> 00:54:24.792
All right.

00:54:25.251 --> 00:54:28.687
So now we can… Gavin, you can do the Ganesha Puja.
