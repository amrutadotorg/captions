00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:10.130
Yogi: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus,

00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:14.862
and is the lotus at the moment...is the lotus loosing its petals?

00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:17.393
And the fruit developing.

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:25.682
You see, it is represented as lotus
because our brain is like a lotus, actually.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.930
If you cut it horizontally you can see

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.722
as if you have cut the petals,

00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:36.582
and if you cut it vertically

00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:39.609
you can see that around the

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:44.507
around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:49.664
But when you are enlightened
what happens, they swell up and they open out,

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.347
and they all have beautiful colors.

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:55.815
They look like tongues of flames, it’s very beautiful.

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:58.736
Now the Sahastrara is open

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:01.164
and the lotus is open,

00:01:01.284 --> 00:01:05.623
and inside you find the fruit already there kept,

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:09.193
which is the Agya Chakra, which sits there.

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:13.878
You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow,

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.503
yellow-covered as we say,

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:22.039
like a gold cap

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:25.623
is the Agnya there, beautiful Agnya is inside.

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:31.626
Now the fruit of the lotus

00:01:32.348 --> 00:01:35.362
is later on we see,

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:42.114
and I would say that is called
as Bindu state, where you become a bindu

00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:46.463
– a dot, it’s a little dot

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.045
– and that dot has to then grow.

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:51.925
So it’s the second stage starts

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:54.970
when you become the fruit of the lotus.

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:09.487
Yogi: Shri Mother, could You say something
about these higher chakras above the Sahasrara?

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:11.332
Shri Mataji: What chakra?

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:20.274
Yogi: I heard people talk about Bindu and
Adi Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:24.285
You see, I don’t think you should worry too much about these.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:30.131
These three stages higher than Sahastrara.

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:33.557
I would suggest just now

00:02:33.684 --> 00:02:37.163
let us concentrate on Sahastrara, is a better idea.

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:41.910
But Bindu, Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:44.832
in which one has to pass through later on,

00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:47.768
and you would pass gradually

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.528
when you develop yourself horizontally.

00:02:50.702 --> 00:02:52.702
That’s what we have started now,

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:57.621
so let us keep to this idea that
we have to develop ourself horizontally.

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.117
We should see how we affect

00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:04.300
the other person,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.372
how we influence the another person.

00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:12.074
For example some people, you see,
they are very egoistical and all that,

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:18.042
they may come in contact with you
and say, “Oh, very nice person, charming person, this, that.”

00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:23.599
But actually that person is just
very physically may be attractive, or

00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:29.877
or may be a little brilliant type of person but doesn’t have anything much in it.

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:33.772
But if that person standing next to you, changes

00:03:34.038 --> 00:03:36.590
the mood and temperament of another person,

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:41.171
then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality.

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:44.381
So let us see how you affect the nature.

00:03:44.543 --> 00:03:45.927
Flowers

00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:50.472
– you saw the miracle of the flowers
that I performed for you the other day.

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:52.547
In the same way

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.803
let us see what is the effect of your character on the

00:03:57.203 --> 00:04:00.975
on the trees, on your friends,

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:03.430
or in the food that you make – everything

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:05.495
everything changes, it’s very beautiful.

00:04:05.693 --> 00:04:08.579
So we have to see that, how it works out.

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:13.619
I have known people who have never known
what is poetry is, suddenly they become poets.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:16.829
Some who were never musicians started singing so well.

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.694
Like Christine, you know Christine,

00:04:18.784 --> 00:04:21.459
she never used to sing, she had a horrible voice.

00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:26.137
And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird!

00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:34.586
So not only you, but on others
what effect is had? What others feel about you?

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:36.573
You see, how you are kind,

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:41.234
good and sweet to others, not superficially,

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:45.031
but your behavior should change another person,

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:47.407
transform another person.

00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:51.267
Your presence should bring auspiciousness.
