00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:11,905
Experience of the Awakening
of the Kundalini Energy

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:24,850
Guided by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
1987-0505, Australia

3
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,493
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

4
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,379
All the time, the left hand is towards Me.

5
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,820
Now. Here you have to say, in your heart,

6
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:50,747
with all sincerity, you have to ask Me
a question.

7
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:57,094
You have to ask Me a question,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

8
00:00:57,295 --> 00:01:01,791
If you want to call Me ‘Shri Mataji’ you
can call that, or you can call Me ‘Mother’,

9
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,934
but whichever way you want to call,
that’s not important.

10
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:08,686
You have to say, “Mother,
am I the Spirit?”.

11
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,514
Ask the question three times in your heart.

12
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:17,726
This is a very fundamental question. Like
a computer you are asking Me a question.

13
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:49,618
Now bring the right hand onto the left-hand
side of your stomach, in the upper part.

14
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:58,287
Here press it. Now this is the centre
of your mastery, your guidance,

15
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:04,835
your Guru Tattwa as they say. So ask
a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”.

16
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:11,063
This is a question to be asked three times,
“Mother, am I my own master?”.

17
00:02:24,802 --> 00:02:32,881
Now, bring your right hand down below,
in the lower part of the abdomen.

18
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:42,174
Now this is the centre from which
all the Divine work is done,

19
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,346
all the pure work is done.

20
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:51,457
Now this centre is such that you have
to ask Me that,

21
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:58,343
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”

22
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:05,614
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”
If you do not ask, I cannot force on you.

23
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:10,766
So to ask Me six times, because
this centre has got six petals.

24
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:15,010
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”

25
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:20,389
This works out all the Divine plans.

26
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,763
Six times you just ask.

27
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:29,151
As a result of this asking, the Kundalini
starts getting awakened.

28
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:44,553
Now to help the Kundalini to rise,
you have to cooperate with her.

29
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:48,893
So please, put your right hand
on the left-hand side,

30
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:54,726
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it,

31
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,973
on your – is the stomach.

32
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:06,126
Now here you have to say with full
confidence, to help the Kundalini to rise,

33
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:12,759
“Mother, I am my own master.”
This you have to say ten times.

34
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,176
These are the Ten Commandments
which you have to say, that,

35
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:21,082
“Mother, I am my own master.”

36
00:04:57,366 --> 00:05:04,649
Now - ten times with full confidence.

37
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,881
Now, please raise your right hand
to your heart.

38
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:20,584
Now, here you have to say, again
with full confidence,

39
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:25,460
“Mother, I am the Spirit.” This is
the truth, you are the Spirit,

40
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:31,898
but you have to say with full confidence,
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

41
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,652
This you have to say twelve times.

42
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:10,294
Now, one has to know that God Almighty
is the Ocean of Love.

43
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,099
But above all, He’s the Ocean
of Forgiveness.

44
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,651
So He forgives; whatever wrong
you do He forgives.

45
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:26,007
So don’t feel guilty and put your
right hand across,

46
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:35,800
on the left-hand side, in the corner which
is made by your neck and your shoulder.

47
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:41,495
Now here you have to say, again
with full confidence, sixteen times,

48
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:44,685
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Please say it,

49
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:49,701
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Sixteen times.

50
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:53,866
“I’m not guilty at all.”

51
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:56,425
Please say it.

52
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,699
Please say it.

53
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,957
Baba, very hot.

54
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:36,117
Now raise your hand across
on your forehead.

55
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,017
Now this is the centre of Christ

56
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:44,668
and is a very important centre.

57
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:51,002
Here you have to say from your heart,

58
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:57,223
“Mother, I forgive everyone.” Please
say it from your heart.

59
00:07:57,424 --> 00:08:03,652
How many times is not the point.
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

60
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:07,342
Now, some would say that is very difficult
to forgive.

61
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:13,333
But it’s a myth that we do not forgive
or we forgive.

62
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,183
We do not do anything in both the cases.

63
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:20,286
But if we don’t forgive, then we play
into wrong hands.

64
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:27,612
So please say from your heart,
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

65
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:39,598
Now please take your hand
on the Back Agnya, the same centre

66
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,831
on the backside of your head, and allow
your head to rest on it

67
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,761
and push it back a little bit.

68
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:52,098
Now here you have to say -

69
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:57,569
for your satisfaction because you always
feel guilty - that,

70
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,458
“Oh, Divine, if I have done anything wrong,
please forgive me.”

71
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:12,483
“Please, forgive me.”

72
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:17,060
From your heart.

73
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:22,672
Now to the fontanel bone area, where
they say they give baptism,

74
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:26,530
but actually it’s an artificial one.

75
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:34,725
Stretch your hand fully and put your centre
of your palm on top

76
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:42,617
of the fontanel bone area, which was
a very soft bone in your childhood.

77
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:47,304
Press it hard, press hard your scalp.

78
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:51,638
Now you have to move it seven times,
saying one thing,

79
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,159
which you have to ask for, “Mother, please,
give us my Self-realization.”

80
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,458
Because I cannot force on you, so you’ve
to ask for it.

81
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:07,652
Seven times, press it hard and move it
seven times. Very hard.

82
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:14,351
Slowly. Saying that.

83
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,714
It’s good.

84
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:08,754
Now, remove the right hand.

85
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,912
Slowly open your eyes.

86
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:19,164
Put your right hand towards Me and see
on your left-hand.

87
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:21,545
Raise it a little higher than your head

88
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:26,867
and see if there’s the cool breeze
is coming out of your head.

89
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:30,487
Some people might get it. Put the right
hand towards Me please,

90
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:34,373
right hand towards Me. And with
the left hand -

91
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:37,709
right hand towards Me - with the left hand.

92
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,593
Just see if there’s a cool breeze coming
out of your head.

93
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:58,169
Now turn it, put left hand towards Me.
See with your right hand.

94
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:13,160
Some people might get hot breeze.
It’s alright.

95
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:17,264
But after some time it will become cool.
