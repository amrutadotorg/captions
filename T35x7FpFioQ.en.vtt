00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.120
It's good for Hamsa Chakra, it's a,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.400
that's why it's good for Hamsa Chakra.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.960
for all of you not to catch cold and all that.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.400
It's already very late

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.960
and I think

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.600
now we are proceeding towards Maharashtra

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.960
in the real way because this was a seminar

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.520
and today is a concluding day for you.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.560
I'll be leaving early in the morning tomorrow

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.200
there's a program for Me fixed there.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.280
So you know My...

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.800
It's not all right?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.040
No, it's not switched on, Mother.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.120
Sorry.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.280
Excuse me, must take it back and...

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.080
Take a seat.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.400
So, tomorrow I'll be leaving for Poona.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.960
And you will be also leaving for Poona

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.680
and from Poona then we'll be going ahead.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.040
Now, so we are going into Maharashtra

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.400
and Poona is supposed to be

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
the holy door of Maharashtra.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.960
In Poona we're going to have a program

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.920
for seven days, I think.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.880
We're going to stay there for seven days all together

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.120
out of which, I think, two days

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.360
you're going to go outside in the villages,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.960
and five days we'll have program in Poona.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.480
Now there we'll try to arrange

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.560
some conveyance for you to go

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.520
to the program places.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.320
But if we are finding it difficult in that case

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.720
I think, you will make it easy for yourself to go to the places

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.960
where we have programs. That will be only five times.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440
So that perhaps you may have to arrange.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.960
The rest of it is being arranged and

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.440
organized.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.200
I'll try, as I said to get buses to take you down

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.320
but incase we cannot please organize yourself.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.040
Only five times maybe... Five times or? No,no...

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.840
Only, only once. Only once.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.840
Engineering college because Paur

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.920
and these two places we've got bus arrangement

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.960
and also Pimpri. So, three places we have arrangements

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.080
and once only, when I have a program,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.760
I've not been able to arrange.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.240
Four days and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.240
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.320
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.960
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.280
Ha, and Lions Club

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.360
also if you want to come you can come to Lions Club,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.960
or I don't know if there's an invitation or not.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.240
So that's fifth day and then sixth day, Kude.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.760
Sixth day is the day you leave

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960
and seventh day is the day you arrive.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.720
So that's how, only for one day is a problem,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.440
when they go to the Engineering College, perhaps

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.760
we might have to arrange one day.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.880
That's only is the headache.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.640
So, that's done.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.960
Now, we have got a good place there.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.000
But it's a place nearby

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.960
all the Rajnesh's people used to live.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.960
And it's such a Sahaja way that we're going down there.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.160
Beat yourself  with shoes

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.240
but first of all that horrible Rajnesh.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.640
Tomorrow morning you beat him nicely with shoes all of you,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.600
so that there won't be any problem for you and don't be afraid.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.360
Now, we are not going to be afraid of all these non-sensical things.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.800
These are all myths

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.360
and we are going to fight them out if they come round.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160
There's nothing that is going to attack you,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.440
if you are strong people.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.960
Nothing attacks Me, why should it attack you?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.120
All right. So, you please

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.160
be prepared and don't be afraid.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.840
You see, especially French, I would say, French style

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.320
is just to be unnecessarily frightened for nothing at all.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
Or somebody who is just aggressive for nothing at all.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.680
Just be in the centre. We can say

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.400
the aggressiveness of Americans is not needed and the frightening,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.880
two extremes I'm telling you.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.320
Frightening behavior of French is not needed.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.840
It's just in between to be,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.960
to be in such a position that you just watch, you are a witness.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.840
See you are a, you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a saint.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.400
And a saint has to move with the dignity of a saint.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.960
So, must remember that you are a saint.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.160
And all the time you must keep the dignity

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.560
and this frightening thing "I'm frightened" and all

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.440
this is absolutely, absolutely ridiculous.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.840
It doesn't behoove or anybody who is aggressive also,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.240
it doesn't behoove. So this is what we have to remember.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.960
We should see, I don't want to praise Indians,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.360
but you should see the way Indians behave.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.040
they are neither aggressive nor frightened.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.760
That's a one thing one has to learn,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.800
because we are imbalanced that way in the West

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.280
because the temperaments are always shattered by the atmosphere.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.680
But here the atmosphere is peaceful, nice, your Mother is with you,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.960
nothing to be worried. I am going to stay with you. All right?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.160
So, May God Bless you all!

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.120
Now, so the most pleasant task I have to do is to

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.440
the French, they are very sweetly as they are,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.960
brought some sweet things for the centers in India,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.640
and I want to present them to the centers.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.280
So, these are nine centers. One by one I'll be calling

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.560
and the people who have to take them should come around. [unclear]

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.320
Now they [are coming there].

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.680
And this is something very sweet, is the tea cups, you see,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.520
in a centre they will have it

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.560
and will be used for Sahaja Yogis only and not for anybody else.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.240
That is definite. Don't use it for your guests.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.560
It's for the Sahaja Yogis only.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.760
A very simple and sweet thing.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.280
Is there any more coming?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.080
Yogi: Come from?

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.320
From France?

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.880
Yes Mother, if You like we can...

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.960
No, no, no more I want. That's all, sufficient.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.840
No, that's all you have bought for the time being

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.960
All right, finished. Because you see, to carry all the way...

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.440
Now, this one is for

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.560

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.920

This one is for Bombay centre.

This is from Poona centre. Now who is taking Poona things?

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.960

Kalwa - it's all right.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.280

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.960
Now, [Hindi/Marathi].

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.960

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.960
But that's a... Is that a present from London?

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.880
The ghee. Or is to be paid?

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.600
It's a present, Mother.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.840
It's a present. All right, so the ghee has come as a present,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.480
but that will be used mostly for you, I'm sorry.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.960
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.800
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.800
Now, we have done everything. Now all...

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.720
Is there any more to be presented anywhere?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.160
For luggage we have reduced your luggage quite a lot.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.160
All the luggage that you had, everything has been reduced now.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.760
Not much has to be carried.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.960
Now, your own luggage has to be put on top.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.200
Tomorrow somebody... Who is incharge of?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.960
One, two buses.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.280
Which Indian is responsible for the buses?

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.200
Who is going to go throughout? [Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.800
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.800
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.240
So, Avdhut and he is responsible for one bus.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.280
For the second bus who is responsible?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.800
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.160
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.600
Anand Than.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.800
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.520
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.960
[Hindi/Marathi] Who is responsible for the second bus?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.560
So, what we can do, we can put Avdhut in one

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.920
And I will be in another one.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.280
Now, I have to tell you one thing, that

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.080
we have made provision everywhere for your food, everywhere.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.000
But please, for Heaven's sake, anybody even some Sahaja Yogis say

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.960
that you have food in this hotel or anything please don't take it.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.560
because then I'm not responsible if you get food headache and all,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.280
food stomach and headache.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.520
Because food in the stomach

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.800
has to go in a proper way and here sometimes could be horrible.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.200
So please don't take your food outside.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.960
Doesn't matter, if you don't get sometimes, doesn't matter.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.080
It's not so important that
you must eat all the time

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.840
Sometimes if it is little fasting doesn't matter,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.960
but don't eat anywhere on the way.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.400
That's one thing I have to request you, very important is,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.200
that you get to some place and eat something.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.720
Because these are places where

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.960
there is danger because you are so sensitive.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.840
Though you get, you do not get very fresh food

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.360
in the West, but you get clean food.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.960
But I must admit in India it's very difficult.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.960
So, I've tried to make the cooking arrangements myself

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.840
so that you don't get food that is contaminated or troublesome.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.720
So, I have to tell you again and again,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.560
you are not to go to any hotel

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.120
or any place, stop on the way, eat something there.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.280
Doesn't matter if you are hungry, doesn't matter.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.960
You can take some chana or something

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.360
but don't eat food anywhere even if some Sahaja Yogi tells you.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.960
Don't give any money to any Sahaja Yogi at any cost.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.240
Don't spoil any Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.760
Not a single pie is to be given to any Sahaja Yogi in India

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.160
and don't spoil anyone, by telling "You can come to Delhi or do...".

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.440
Nothing. Nobody's going to pay for any Sahaja Yogi anymore,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.960
nor do you sell anyone of your things to the Sahaja Yogis

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.200
like electronic things or donate anything to anyone in India.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.080
Is prohibited. All right?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.880
Nothing is to be done for Sahaja Yogis. You don't have to give

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.840
any kind of alms or

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.680
any kind of donation or anykind of scholarship or

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.120
anything whatsoever.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.480
If I have to do, I can do it.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.920
You are not to give a single pie to anyone, please remember.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.280
Anybody who comes to you and says give me five rupees for lend me,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.120
you are not to give at any cost.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.520
Except for those people who are incharge if they

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.560
need sometimes some money you can give and I'll adjust it.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.480
But nobody else.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.160
So, we have got you and Avdhut, two persons will be in charge.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.720
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.960
So on the whole, our program is we go to Poona first,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.360
from Poona we go to....

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.440
Satara?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.080
Satara is a place where Shivaji's

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.240
descendants ruled. There were two

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.960
kingdoms, one was Poona another was Satara.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.960
So we go to Satara. From Satara Kohlapur.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.640
Kohlapur - [Hindi/Marathi]

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.960
There were two, we should say it was divided into three,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.960
Shivaji's kingdom divided into two, into Kohlapur and Satara

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.360
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.360
And peshwai, the ministers formed another

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.960
thing called Peshwai, in Poona, later on, when Shivaji died.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.560
After him there were big problems

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.960
So that is how in Kohlapur we have got a

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.200
very good temple of the Goddess,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.240
which you'll see and where people have used tantrism

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.440
so we have to go and clear it out there.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.880
Then?

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.240
Solapur.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.120
Then we go to Solapur.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.440
Solapur is a place you have been there already.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.320
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.960
There are good...

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.640
Because we'll not stay in Solapur we'll stay at Pandharpur.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.040
We have decided to stay at Pandharpur

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.960
and come for program to Solapur which is close.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.200
Solapur is a place as you know, where

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.280
it is the greatest pilgrim pilgrimage for Maharashtrians.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.960
They go walk one month to go down there.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.680
It's a very famous pilgrimage but be careful

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.120
about the pandaas and the Brahmins and all that.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.400
Don't allow anybody to touch your forehead.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.640
Don't go into any temple

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.600
and allow them to touch your forehead.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.080
you can go and see the statues and things like that that's all.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.240
And that's a place where, I think, you will like it

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.040
and there are simple people who, village folks,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.960
who are coming there to pay their homage to Shri Krishna.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.560
Is called as Vitthala on the right side Vishuddhi.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.600
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.760
Then from there we go to Pandharpur, I mean,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.440
so you stay in Pandharpur.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.960
From Pandarpur we go, this is the longest route we have to take,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.840
so we go round to Narsinghpur,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.680
which is close by, about one and a half hour, where you see a temple

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.600
which is of Narasimha avatara, of the Prahlada style.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.600
It's very interesting but I won't be with you.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.680
But it's very interesting to know that Prahlad,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.240
who lived thousands and thousands of years back,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.360
much before Shri Krishna,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.840
his mother was abducted from Multan.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.960
It's in the North towards the Pakistan. It is now in Pakistan.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.960
And the king was ruling there and the lady was brought

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.640
to a guru who was staying in this place

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.040
where you will be going, near the river Nira.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.760
Now you know My name is also Nira. Nira means Mari, Marie or

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.960
what you call "the marine".

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.000
And this gentleman stayed there.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.160
I should say, she was abducted by Indra.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.200
Indra is the King of all the Gods.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.160
And this gentleman Mr. Indra when he went and saw the guru

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.800
who was staying in that ashram, was Shandilya which is

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.520
which is My gotra. My father's gotra is Shandilya.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.480
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.960
So the Shandilya, you see, this little boy stayed with Shandilya,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.640
at the age when he was of five years of age, I think

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.040
and he used to play along the river. And there we are trying to get

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.960
a plot of land which is of twenty-five acres of land,

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.640
for our future, real ashram we'll have,

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.920
near the river, bank of river Nira.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.760
And something, in My childhood I've written some poems with the

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.520
bank, on the bank of Nira river. I've written,

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.320
long time back some poems, but I don't know where are they.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.240
But I wrote some poems about it.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.840
So, I knew that we'll be settled down there.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.240
You should have a look at the temple and should have a look

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.360
at the Nira river and the place where

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.880
we are going to have our ashram.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.960
Now, this one is, you will be going down there, and now this boy

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.960
was making a statue of Narasimha which was going to incarnate.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.960
And then guru Shandilya told Indra that don't do like this

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.680
you return this lady back to her husband, though he is a rakshasa,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.680
Hiranyakashipu, doesn't matter.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.200
This child is going to bring forth the advent of Narasimha.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.960
So, he returned her back and when he returned her back, you see,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.600
then you know what happened and Narasimha avatara took place. And

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.320
after thousands of years back, later

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.440
then one of the Peshwas built this temple there of Narasimha.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.360
And he put one statue of Shri Vishnu there.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.960
But Shri Vishnu appeared in his, a this thing,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.320
in his dream, they say so, and told him that

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.720
"Prahlada has already made My statue

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.880
of Narsimha in that place. You go and find it out."

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.080
So they found out a statue made out of sand.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.960
And that is still there, kept there.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.320
And that is always looked after. So, it's a very interesting place.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.920
And you'll see that temple is very interesting, you'll like it.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.920
And from there, from...  But don't allow anybody

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.520
to touch your forehead, again I say.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.680
None of them are realized souls there. But the temple is good.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.120
And then you come down from there to Poona,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.080
just to touch Poona. In Poona the food will be provided for you.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.800
Don't eat on the way in any hotel or any place.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.960
In Poona there will be food ready for you. Take your food,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.960
and then you proceed to Rahuri.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.880
This, all this might take about

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.440
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.800
about seven and a half hours all together.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.560
but you'll have rest in between.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.760
Then you go to Rahuri. Then I will come to Rahuri also

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.480
and then we'll have Rahuri program, the village programs

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.960
and all those programs and we'll be back on the

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.520
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.760
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.240
Rahuri we are staying in a very beautiful place no doubt.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.040
Five, six days.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.760
About six days, I think. Six days in Rahuri.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.960
And then, we will be there, I know when we'll be there.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.960
We'll be there till the tenth, till the tenth.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.960
And then we are back, and from Rahuri we go to Dhulia, by bus,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.040
where Raolbai has arranged for you

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.440
to stay in a nice place there, in Dhulia.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.880
We'll be there for two days and from Dhulia we come to Nasik.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.960
From Nasik you'll go to see this Chaturshringi,

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.400
temple of Markandeya,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.480
which is a very beautiful one, early in the morning.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.960
Then you are going to go to Bhadsa and then to Vaitarna.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.480
We are going to stay in Vaitarna. There will be a puja in Vaitarna.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.920

The place is not confirmed.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.920

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.760
Where are the tickets?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.440

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:46.560
So, these people have to go and you have to sort it out.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.520
Now, we have got Mr. Mathur here,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.080

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.440
you must arrange with others. All right?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.280

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.960
Now, for Geneva people; Are there Geneva people here?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.680
They have not yet arrived, Mother.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.640
They are coming in the second round.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.280
No, they're coming on the 25-th, Mother.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.800

Where are we going to be on the 21-st?

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.760
Tomorrow are they? Tomorrow.

Tomorrow, so they'll come to Poona. All right.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.320
So then, Geneva people [Hindi/Marathi].

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.480
Fifty-four, then Geneva people.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.960
Then we got people from America and from Canada.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.400

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.600

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.280
So, Belgium, how many are there?

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.440

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.880
How many? Five.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.680
But they are going back with You.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.200

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.720
21-st.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.400
At the end of the [unclear].

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.320
All right.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.560
Those, who have come for one month,

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.960
who are not going to Delhi, who are those?

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.680
Mother,

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.440
the Italians, who go back, have to be

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.120
in Bombay, by the 16-th. 16-th, they depart.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.840
So their question doesn't arise. All the Italians are going back?

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.960
No, Mother.Pedro and Giovanni...

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.440
How many are going to Delhi, let's have it? Italians and French.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.280
Yogini: [UNCLEAR]

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.400
Let's have it. How many? Just count.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.400

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.680

Eight. And how many are coming?

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.040
From Geneva?

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.720
They are going to be for one week, most of them.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.360
More, for one month.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.160
Most Geneva people are.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.960
One more French. We'll be nine, Mother.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.960
One French is coming tomorrow also.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.680
We'll be, we will be nine going to Delhi.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.600
Nine. And most of the French, they are going back.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.800
Half the Geneva are going back.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.080
Mother, some of the Swiss are already coming

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.600
on the 7-th of this month.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.360
Some Swiss are coming on the second month, certainly.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.600
Same for Italians, Mother.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.640
That's different. How many they are?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.440
I'm not sure, Mother [UNCLEAR].

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.800
Excuse me, Mother, we worked it out plus minus after deducting

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.400
those who are going back and those are staying back,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.440
it's for hundred and ten, for Delhi.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.720
For a hundred and ten. He says about...

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.640
I have all the people here. So You can, You can, You can...

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.400
Now, let us have Rustom in charge of all this

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.040
so that he allots us these things. All right.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.360
So hundred and ten are going to Delhi.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.960
Out of which who are not going to Delhi,

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.960
when are they returning back? What date?

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.400
16-th?

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.520
How many are returning just on the 16-th?

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.040
Because they have paid for a month.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.320
16-th. Now 16-th [Hindi/Marathi].

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.840
Where are we going to be on the 16th? [Hindi/Marathi]

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.680
Nasik, Nasik.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.960
15-th we arrive in Nasik. On 20-th we arrive in Borli.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.600
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.280
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.120
[Hindi/Marathi]15-th to 19-th.[Hindi/Marathi]

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.840
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.680
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.720
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.400
So, we would suggest, it would be better,

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.240
if you don't have time, all right, but would be better that

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.200
when we come back to Bombay you should go away.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.240
All right, it's all right.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.880
The rest of you will have to arrange your own, then, way

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.400
because we will be in a place called Nasik

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.160
from where you can take a train to come to Bombay

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.960
and from Bombay they'll arrange for you to go, all right?

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.360
So those who want to go on the 16-th definitely, how many there are?

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.520
Four.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.960
So, four? Four?

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.560
Yes, four. One more.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.800
Just five?

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.640
Because our ticket is booked and we can't change.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.280
All right, so 16-th those who have to go,

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.920
must arrange their going to Bombay from Nasik.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.920
Because you must leave on the 14th,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.320
to reach Bombay in time.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.880
16-th evening you have to leave?

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.120
There, I have, the flight is on the 18-th but...

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.760
All right.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.320
Then 16-th, you have to organize that part.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.520
We can't organize, you see,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.920
16-th we can't organize. But if you are coming on the

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.960
28-th [Hindi/Marathi].

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.160
21-st they are coming to Bombay.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.400
If you are going on the 21-st,

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.000
those who would like to go on the 21-st

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.960
we can organize their coming.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.720
So those who are being earlier

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.000
must look after themselves, all right?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.720
All right? Quite fair?

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.320
Fifty-three people from Europe, America, Europe, can use the lodge.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.160
Now, what I'm saying

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.600
As they had an emergency that [Hindi/Marathi],

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.760
[Hindi/Marathi] And we'll organize it.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.720
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.080
[Hindi/Marathi] I said, "why it is a problem"?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.080
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.480
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.520
[Hindi/Marathi] We can organize their stay, there is no problem.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.000
No, they don't want to stay.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.720
They want to go, let them go.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.760
Mother, we cannot change our ticket, Mother. It is...

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.600
That's what I am saying.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.000
So, they are trying to be very,you see, generous.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.800
They said "We'll arrange for them everything".

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.840
I said "they cannot stay", so no question.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.960
So, I would suggest Gregoire you should come one or two days earlier

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.080
to Bombay if you have to do any purchasing or anything,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.920
you can be there with Rajesh,

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.480
because Rajesh is going on the 20-th himself.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.240
He says Me you could be there with him for one or two days.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.080
And you could be here and that's how you arrange your own going.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.720
That's the point is. The main point is that we won't be able

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.920
to manage that. But from Nasik you can get a train.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.880
We'll help you but you must remember that you have to go.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.640
All right.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.760
So, fifty people are going, non Australians, are going to Delhi.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.200
They all are to be present in the second month.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.960
So, now, for Delhi people they have to arrange

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.960
for fifty-four people, first of all.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.480
Hundred and four, total.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.640
Altogether hundred and four.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.600
out of which the [Hindi/Marathi], French and

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.320
Italians, they can stay with My brother.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.360
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.760

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.960

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.120
Belgian people, are they going to stay after second...?

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.800
They have come for one moth or two months?

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.760
One month? So, no question, no problem.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.320
When, when do you want to go?

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.960

No Mother. The tickets are being collected, Mother.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.400
But they, their flight hasn't been brought.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.920
It is flexible.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.960

Those who want to go on the 23-rd, can go away.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.440
Those who want to stay, maybe some people won't get reservation.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.000
Now, those who want to have reservation to Delhi

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.760
must talk to Modi

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.880
because we have got all the Australians being reserved.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.440
Those who haven't got reservations, going back to England,

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.440
or going to Delhi, please talk to him.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.560

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.720
Mother, may I say something, please?

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.880
Guido and I, have no ticket aeroplane.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.760
Could we go with the Indians from Mumbai to Delhi in the train?

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.080
Train? How many are going by train from here?

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.880
Canadians want. The Swiss will have to go by train

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.600
Who?

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.200
The Swiss will have to go by train.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.680
There's only one Swiss. There's only one.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.920
There are several.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.240
...who are here for the second month.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.360
The Canadians want.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.560
There's only one?

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.240
Yes, above this list.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.680
Just there?

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.960
All right, then you will have to go by train.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.160
That you'll have to arrange. We'll arrange that.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.960
So, you want three seats to be booked by train.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.800
Yogi: Well, we can do there right...

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.360
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.480
Shri Mataji, for foreigners,

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.240
if they just go with their passport to the tourist office,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.560
they get a train ticket overnight, there's no problem.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.120
No, no, Modi will arrange.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.000
We have got all the Railway people with us. We'll arrange.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.120
So, you tell Modi about those things.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.280
Yes, yes, thank you, Mother.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.760
So, those who have not booked their seats to Delhi

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.000
please inform Mr. Modi.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.360
And those who are coming now also tell them this.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.080
Who will tell them? Rustom, you tell.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.280
All right, Rustom and Alexander in charge.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.960
Just foreigners. Now, Shri Mataji, if I could suggest, perhaps

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.160
the English and those who haven't booked their seats to Delhi,

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.800
they can go on the 25th in the early morning.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.160
What's the use?

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.120
Because they've booked hall until the 24-th.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.960
They have booked what?

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.840
They booked a hall in Bombay till the 24-th.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.720
What's the use?

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.960
As, I mean, just if You wanted to have them stay in Bombay.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.240
I mean, those who want to stay in Bombay,

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.960
they can stay in Bombay till the 25-th; 25th.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.880
If those who want to see for some shopping or anything, can stay.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.040
But there is no such program in Bombay, except

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.960
that we wanted you to have some nice time there.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.760
22nd we'll have a farewell.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.800
Then 23rd, 24th is there.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.640
So why I was saying that if go you earlier,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.600
the people are anxious there in Delhi also to accommodate you.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.480
So, whatever you decide. So we have three days now,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.520
23-rd, 24-th, 25-th. Whenever you get your reservations, you go.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.960
[Hindi/Marathi] Done.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.600
Now, everyone from every country should be responsible

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.480
for that country and for those people.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.200
I'm talking here for everyone, so everyone is responsible.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.840
You should find out, all right? Derrick, are you going to Delhi?

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.320
All right. Have you booked your seat?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.520
It's being done altogether, Mother.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.640

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.320
Nick is doing, Nick is making all the...

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.840
Nick, you can't do it because you are not going back now.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.040
You have to give it to Modi. All right.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.960
All right? Done?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.000
Clear cut.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.080
So, then we go to Delhi.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.840
In Delhi we have decided that

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.080
from the 23-rd onwards, you are going to stay with Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.000

And they want to look after you. This is a new scheme.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.520
And they want to take you round to proper places.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.760
Don't go on your own.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.400
And they will do whatever shopping you like

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.320
and not like crazy people last time. It was very funny

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.400
that people were very upset with you.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.360
So, we want you to be cleared out completely.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.160
And after that at the end of the program

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.200
they will take you to Haridwar;

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.480

Everybody is going on the 14th?

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.560
No, some of us have open tickets.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.920
Some of us have open tickets.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.600
What is it?

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.120
English, I think, the English and French have open ticket.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.960
Or for the second month.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.160
All right. So, it will help us if you all could go.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.880
Or you'll have to come back. From Delhi you are going on the 14-th?

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.960
You have open ticket from Delhi? All right.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.720
Everybody has open ticket from Delhi, is it?

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.640
No, Mother, some of the Canadians have booked on the 20-th.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.880
Some of the Canadians have booked on the 20-th.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.200
Some of the Canadians have booked on the 20th.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.040
20-th from Delhi?

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.920
Yes, Mother.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.960
But we can't arrange.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.960
We will try to change the booking then.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.720
You should because you see, till the 14-th now, we have arranged.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.960
You see, it's difficult. Here we have arranged

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.680
two days this side, but there we found it difficult.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.440
Two days we have to make it earlier, all right?

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.240
So, we'll have it the last day, 14-th.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.320
When are you flying out, earliest?

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.560
Four a.m. on the 14th.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.440
Four a.m. on the 14th?

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.560
Oh, God!

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.640
So, you should be back on the 13-th morning.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.640
We might be able to change that a bit later, but...

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.320
We may be able to change that a little later in the day,

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.760
The flight doesn't leave after 2:30 in the afternoon.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.400
So what I am saying, from Haridwar -

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.720
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.440
[Hindi/Marathi].

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.080
So, 14-th they'll go away. Those who want to leave beyond 14-th,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.080
we have no arrangements for them.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.960
Mother this is very important because last time,

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.880
it created a problem and people must understand that.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.600
You see, I am sorry. We can't do it.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.400
All right?

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.720
Those who have to leave after,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.120
we have to vacate the place on the 14-th, I'm sorry to say.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.160
14-th evening we have to leave the place.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.760
We cannot get for a longer period.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.680
You know, Delhi is a very difficult place,

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.840
it's extremely difficult everything difficult.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.520
Now, one more thing,

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.760
in Delhi, you will be for the 26-th which is our Independence day.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.960
Those who want to see the Independence day parade

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.600
have to pay hundred rupees.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.880
So, those who really want to see - the parade is very interesting -

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.440
should give that money to Mr. Mathur

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.280
and it can be arranged.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.200
Give your names and money now.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.960
But cannot be arranged later on. Hundred rupees are to be paid,

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.160
for seeing that parade,

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.520
which is a very important thing. Luckily you are there on the 26-th,

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.400
but it is left to you, because that is extra.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.400
All right?

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.920
So, on the 14th those people who want to leave,

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.840
can go to other place, like Jaipur; we can arrange it also.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.400
Can go to Jaipur and this and that

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.480
and Agra and all that, if you want to go.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.520
We can arrange it with someone

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.960
but there will be no residential arrangements for you

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.560
which will be quite reasonably arranged, no doubt,

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.800
but still there won't be any residential arrangement

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.360
and I think you should not again trouble the Sahaja Yogis of Delhi.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.960
Because then what happens

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.560
Sahaja Yogis are available

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.560
so you go and stay with them, is not proper.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.760
They have invited you for seven, eight days, all right?

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.840
So, nobody should expect the Sahaja Yogis

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.960
to keep you in their houses

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.480
even if they force you - Indians are like that.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.960
You see, this is how we are.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.680
We force you too much -

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.160
- but you shouldn't accept.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.720
Like food also - we'll go on forcing -

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.400
that's our style is.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.600
But you shouldn't just say because we are forcing you,

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.640
you go on eating - that's our style.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.840
That's you must understand Indian style is like that they'll say

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.960
take some more, take some more - that's our style.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.400
Is a, but you should not eat too much.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.080
It's not good for your health, you understand?

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.840
And not good for the budget either.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.800
So, this is our Indian style of feeding people and I've always seen

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.240
people complain that we have fed too much and all that.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.280
I mean, it's something so absurd.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.040
Nobody's putting in your mouth with a piston, you see.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.840
The way it is described I'm really surprised.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.240
So, you should eat as much as you like. Don't overeat.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.880
It's no need. At least on the contrary, I think, little undereat.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.040
Good for you. It is better for digestion.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.440
All right? So, this is what it is. Gregoire, what is the problem?

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.200
I would like to...

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.080
I would like to bring to the attention of Modi

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.080
that there are five people coming on the 15th.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.200
So, they will call one of those people in Bombay.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.080
I don't know whether it is still worth to go to Vaitarna or not

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.320
but these five people will go to Delhi

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.160
and you should add them to the reservation in the train.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.720
Because I don't think they will have and need to go by train.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.520
All right, all right. That much we have to inform.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.240
Modi, these five people will be coming on the 15-th.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.920
Yes. January.

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.320
- Modi, we'll accept them.
- Who are they?

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.960
They are, they are three....

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.360
I'll give you the names, okay?

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.440
Mataji I don't know of the arrangements are here

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.440
this Sahni guest house, but we have to be out by 10 o'clock

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.160
otherwise we have to pay another day.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.680
Yes, you better get up in the morning,

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.720
very early in the morning tomorrow and we have to be out.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.360
And this man has really troubled Me for nothing at all.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.920
He's taken money for not eating food and all that, this Sahni fellow

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.920
and you have to tell him that you better give money back to Mother

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.360
otherwise we are not going to give you the keys.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.840
You better go and tell him.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.560
You should say that he's asked for royalty.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.320
You say, "this is not some sort of a

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.200
property that you are asking for royalty.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.920
When you have not given us anything to eat

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.080
how dare you take money from us ?" And just tell him.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.000
You better tell him that and then he'll let him to come and see Me;

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.120
he's not seen Me yet.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.040
All right. And first beat him with shoes, nicely.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.480
Now, what more?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.680
So, because today

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.480
we have talked about all the things so that one should not know

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.120
"I did not know this, Mother." Last time it happened.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.400
Lots of confusion. People who wanted to go away,

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.280
"Mother, You must arrange for my ticket.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.200
I have to get into the train and

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.080
I can't find this, how will I go?' So, you see, don't bother Me

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.920
with all these headaches. It's not good.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.000
Tell your leader and you tell Me beforehand.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.720
Because here the reservations and travelling

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.640
and everything is a very difficult thing in this country.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.800
It's not like America, just get into the plane and walk off.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.200
It's not that way. So you must understand; there's a big difficulty.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.200
And later on if you tell Me suddenly,

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.760
"I want to go to Bombay, Mother, I have to go back."

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.440
I cannot arrange. It cannot be arranged. Very bad.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.880
Situation is very bad as far as reservations of the trains,

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.240
reservation of the planes and also arrangement

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.960
for any conveyance or anything is concerned. All right?

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.080
Mother, two things You've recommended before.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.920
Could they finish with the cold wash

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.040
and secondly they must wear a singlet, a vest.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.120
They're taking cold washes?

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.800
No, they're just having hot, Mother,

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.480
but they should finish with the cold.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.840
- Yes .
- And also wearing vests.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.320
Now, to get over some problems, that you have personal problems

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.120
which I have to tell you, this is a very

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.240
country, with a treacherous climate.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.480
It's not London, so you don't wear a overcoat here.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.720
You see, it's not obviously cold.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.360
But is full of dust and there are problems,

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.960
so, I would request all of you to wear a singlet

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.280
all the time, all the time.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.160
And in Poona if you go you can find out singlet

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.920
very cheap and very good and it is compulsory for all Sahaja Yogi

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.080
male people, to wear a singlet and for ladies to wear something

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.880
under their gowns.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.800
So, it is compulsory in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.560
It's a Sahaja Yoga tradition to wear a singlet.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.720
And moreover I've tried to get good buses but maybe

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.680
you must cover your nose and mouth, shut when you are travelling,

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.960
and talk less because you all get Vishudhis. Talk less.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.920
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, will go nowhere.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:46.960
Just don't talk. Enjoy. See things. Enjoy. All right?

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:51.360
Talking should be much less. I think talking is much more.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.560
So, now, what is, another thing is for bathing.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.240
You should take your bath with hot water, all right?

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.080
And your brush and all that should be used with hot water,

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.800
all that, but end up with cooler water.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.640
When you come out of the room you should be

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.920
bathing with a cooler water, will help you.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.200
Not that you come out with hot water outside,

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.200
you'll get into troubles, you'll have colds.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.720
So, to avoid cold we'll also arrange

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.520
to give you dhunis and things like that.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.680
But you should be careful also that you gargle

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.200
your mouth every morning so that you don't trouble Me, all right.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.400
If your Vishudhi is bad you know My Vishudhi goes out,

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.600
because the vibrations start flowing.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.840
This is for Vishudhi.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.000
Don't eat anything outside, don't overeat.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.720
Don't eat things, fruits and all that

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.840
and then take water on top of that.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.240
You're not to eat fruits and then water.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.240
If you have taken fruit then you must eat some biscuit or something

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.680
and then take the water.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.640
These are all very simple things

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.640
which Indians know which you do not know.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.880
So, on fruit don't take water.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.760
Be careful about water. Don't take water here and there.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.680
Only take water from a certified thing.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.080
Another is aerated water.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.280
We are so much used to have and this is an old habit, I think,

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.360
too much of aerated water.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:16.440
Please avoid aerated water as much as you can. It's not good.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.840
We don't pack very good aerated water here

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.600
and it's not good for your stomach. So,

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.480
anywhere you go, if you have to buy aerated water, you pay for it.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.240
We are not going to supply you this time.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.880
Last time we found it impossible because

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.320
I mean, as Western people have a habit ,

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.200
I mean, they have a capacity to go to extremes.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.880
People have consumed so much of aerated water

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.720
that if you tell Indians, they can't believe. Even tea.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.400
If it comes to tea, they go on consuming so much of tea that

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.400
people are really shocked. I mean, it's like children, you know.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.520
So, you must not, you must limit your tea.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:53:00.800
Six cups or say, seven cups at the most, per day.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.280
Impossible. Impossible.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.920
You can't go with seven cups.

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.960
Not more than seven cups.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.040
More than seven cups not needed at all.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.440
And there's no need at all.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.880
You see, and take water. Water is important.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.680
The country has such a supply of water. Take as much as you can.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.360
And specially the water from the wells it's very good.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.040
It's fresh, nice. It has little taste of the well, doesn't matter.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.960
But you take fresh water . Water must be consumed in this country.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.320
We don't take any aerated water at all. This is all modern stuff.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.080
And we don't take any wines or anything. We just live with water.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.720
Shopping, Mother. They shouldn't go mad this shopping

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.160
in the early stages. Let it happen in Delhi or in Bombay.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.720
I think, Bombay you should not shop at all,

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.880
because Bombay is not a place for shopping.

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.560
It's very expensive place.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.800
So, best is keep it for Delhi. You will have seven days

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.080
but one should not go mad with shopping also.

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.040
Way people last time behaved

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.800
was that Delhi people just got very angry

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.160
because you see, they couldn't understand these saints

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.400
going mad with the shopping the way.

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.080
And we had to get some provision

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.960
from the Air India, they had given some provision

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.080
for carrying My luggage while they carried their all luggage

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.600
and they went from here like traders, you see. Doesn't look nice.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.120
So one should not go crazy about it. It's all right,

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.960
buy something that you can do it in these seven days

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.520
but the Sahaja Yogis are going to be with you.

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.280
So they will watch you,

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.760
All right?

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.320
So be careful.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.920
Drop down.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.920
Materialism has to be brought down.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.240
What else?

00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.600
What about, what other craziness one can have?

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.400
Now the most important and the delicate thing

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.800
is about marriage.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.880
I would like to have marriages performed;

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.400
we have got a date fixed for marriages in Delhi.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.880
But that doesn't mean that you start looking out for girls here.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:27.200
What we're going to do, we are going to have in Vaitarna,

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.520
I'm going to ask you people

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.040
for the names of the girls who would like to marry, the priorities.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.600
There may be five or six girls or the boys

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.320
and the girls have to suggest.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.160
If there's any matching done

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:45.280
then I'll talk to you privately, we'll arrange the marriage,

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.560
and then we can have the marriage in Delhi.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.680
But for the marriage performance you have to pay some extra money,

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.520
if your marriage takes place.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.880
Those who want to have a Sahaja Yoga marriage also otherwise

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.960
can have a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.480
But it should not be a madness about it

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.000
that you look at every girl and all that but just

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.920
think it over in Vaitarna, I will ask you to tell Me

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.200
if you want to marry a particular girl

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.880
If the girl also asks for you, otherwise I will not.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.960
So, all of you, those who want to marry

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.400
among all of those who are here;

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.640
those who want to wait, we can have a another marriage session

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.800
in London or anywhere else.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.520
All right?

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:46.120
Keep a very healthy, friendly and a relationship of purity.

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.120
The boys should be friendly with boys

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.120
and girls should be friendly with girls.

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.240
There should not be much mixing up, there's no need to.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.520
And it is better that way.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.280
They are of course your brothers and things like that

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.320
so naturally one talks to them but

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.080
you must understand the trends that we have had

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.640
and how we have to change it.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.000
What else? The most delicate part.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.480
What they want Me to do? Turna have you any questions?

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:23.960
Wear a sweater when you sleep in the night.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.120
This is a treacherous place where you might catch cold.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.120
And it might be cooler where we go now.

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.880
So, wear a sweater or something

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.760
and keep yourself covered, keep your head covered

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.120
when you go in the evening time.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:43.120
That's all I can say under your, under your

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.200
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.680
- Kurte to kya kehte hain English mein?

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.880
- shirt.

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.240
But not the Indian kurtas, whatever you wear.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.320
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:04.080
You want to speak to Patricia [UNCLEAR]

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.720
What did they say?

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.880
Mother, I haven't been spoken to either of them.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.160
- But [UNCLEAR] knows..
- Please come forward.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.280
Those sitting at the back, please come forward

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.200
and let the arrangement for dinner be made.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.920
What about Patricia and [UNCLEAR].

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.880
They, they met today.

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.840
Let the arrangements for dinner be made.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.800
Hi, and for those who are travelling by the train to Delhi...

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.120
All right, it's all right, so we have agreed.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.480
Those who are travelling by train to Delhi, meet Mr. Modi.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.760
Now for every centre, that we should tell about the sarees [Hindi/M]

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:52.400
Nobody should buy any saree for any centre whatsoever.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.880
I've got sarees for every centre.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.440
Should we leave the list of sarees we have got?

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.040
Yes, I think that's [UNCLEAR].

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.920
Where is it?

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.680
One more is coming now.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.440
One more plane.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.120
You give him one more?
-Shri Mataji I spoke to Derrick.

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.840
He says there's only one person in Bristol which is going to come.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:25.640
In Bristol?
-Yes.

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.440
No, no he would like to do, this Derrick has got.

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.760
- That I spoke to him.
- Yes, what did he say?

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.800
- He says that there's only Ruth in Bristol who says that [UNCLEAR]

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.120
She doesn't want to.
- Let's be [UNCLEAR]

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.120
She doesn't want; then why did he ask him?

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.240
-He asked You?

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.640
- Not, not this Derrick.

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.800
No, no, no, I said not this Derrick.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.280
I said of Fergi;  Fergi, where is he?

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.200
Derrick?

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.920
Fergi, you wanted to buy  sari for Bristol, na?

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.160
I'm living in London, Mother.

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.800
I'm in London, Mother.

00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.600
In London, but you asked Me to buy a sari for Bristol.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.840
I don't know what the arrangements are Mother

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.240
Did you ask Shri Mataji to...?

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.120
Yes, he did.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.960
It is you only suggested Bristol.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.440
- That's the case, Mother.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.960
We should get...
- He should ...

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.000
But I didn't, I didn't know what was created Mother will send that

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.240
to every certain centre so I didn't know [unclear].

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.240
So, it's sorted out, it's sorted out with Nick.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.760
We sorted it out.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.560
Just be optimistic. This will be up to you.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.080
You see, we have to have some Puja there.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.600
So we, for Bristol, what are you getting?

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.960
You, you are getting a seven-fifty.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.640
Tell her to get some four-fifty then.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.960
But she has to still buy.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.200
- Seven- fifty is fine Shri Mataji.
- No, it's too much.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.800
Seven-fifty will be how much?
-She got it paid Shri Mataji ...

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.200
All the English sarees should be paid out of the central fund.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.480
And everytime there is a Puja they could be re-paid.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.720
All right.
-  It's a better way.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.360
Now, no, no, about sarees. Now this is  we have decided.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.360
Sit down, please.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:11.600
We have decided there are going to be seven Pujas in London,

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.480
which must be supported by all of you

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.920
and so, everybody may have to pay about 200 rupees for these sarees.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.600
from every centre. One hundred or two hundred, something like that.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.880
These are how many, these are?

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.480
- All together?
- All together seven.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.320
Thirty-five. And seven, seven Pujas, yes.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.920
Seven Pujas sarees. See, the Pujas we are going to have, let's see.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.160
- General Pujas.
- Ganesha,

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.960
- Ganesha's Puja,
- Diwali,

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.000
- Diwali puja,
- Guru Purnima,

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.720
- Guru Purnima,
- Navaratri,

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.520
The Guru Nanak Puja,

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.920
- Guru Nanak Puja.
- And next Christmas.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.960
And next Christmas.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.560
So, six or seven?

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.000
Seven.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.400
These seven Pujas should be, of course

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.200
Janamashtmi. So far always only the, only the

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.280
people from London have been buying sarees for all these things.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.520
It's too much. Because most of the time I am in London.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.480
And to every centre it will cost not more than two hundred

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.880
or say ten pounds, at the most.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.600
- Ten pounds per Puja.
- Per Puja.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.160
- So seventy pounds in total.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.960
- Nai, nai, nai, all together.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.600
- Seventy pounds per year

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.240
No, no, no, not so much.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.080
Seven Pujas, seven Pujas. It's ten pounds per Puja.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.160
Is it? Nai, nai, not so much.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.440
Isko to itna hoyega kaise, ten bahut ho jayega.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.800
Or seventy pounds for the whole year.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.840
Haan, two hundred, for the whole year.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.160
Mother, for the whole year?

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.960
Haan, aur kya? Seven pujas ka jodo kitna hai?

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.480
Jodo kitna hai seven pujas ka, kitna paisa jodo?

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.960
No, no, You are right.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.800
You say for the whole year two hundred. It's not much.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.720
But just count it.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.680
For some people like, they can pay three hundred or something.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.840
- Are you speaking of just...
- Just count it. Calculator have you got?

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.440
One, okay. It's eleven hundred... a thousand is one.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.200
Thousand [unclear].

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.160
Seven thousand seven hundred for the whole year.
So?

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.920
Yes, You... So how many centers there are?

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.800
There must be about, say, fifteen centers.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.800
- At least.
- So seven thousand divided by fifteen, two hundred.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.400
That's what I am saying. So, some have to pay about two hundred

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.000
and maybe, some of you have to pay,

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.360
minimum of two hundred some have to pay and the people who are

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.160
bigger people have to pay three hundred. All right?

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.920
So all the centers have to pay minimum two hundred.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.680
Two hundred rupees.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.800
- The whole year.
- For the whole year

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.120
Explain to them Mother that all of the people from abroad

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.200
would want to contribute, too.
- Yes.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.320
Because I want all of you to contribute.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.440
Even if you contribute say, from every center,

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.960
two hundred rupees, you see, per year.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.960
It's not much, isn't it?

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.040
And why I wanted because it should be done on collective.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.440
It's better. So, all people say they are about fifteen centers.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.400
We all can afford to pay two hundred, all right?

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.560
And you would like to join in, I think so this, isn't it?

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.480
- Including Indians also?
- Of course.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.880
Including Indians, everyone.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.640
Indians [Hindi/Marathi].

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.640
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.840
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.400
So, you see, all the centers of the world

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.120
have to contribute, at the most two hundred.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.440
And at the least [H/M] less than two hundred could be...

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.120
No, it shouldn't be least then it goes down. Two hundred is nothing.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.680
Two hundred is nothing. All together, two hundred, every centre

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.360
has to give for the whole year.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.080
All right. So it comes to about, how many pounds? Twelve pounds.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.240
I think twelve or thirteen pounds.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.480
- In dollars would be about...
- It is twelve pounds.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.040
About twelve pounds, all right?

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.960
So one pound a year, a month.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.840
- What do you say?
- Per centre

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.400
Per centre. Very expensive.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.600
Per month one pound.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.840
Because I want everyone to join in.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.920
All right. So the...

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.680
Then it's the Birthday Puja,

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.080
which will be celebrated in Australia which as is the same that,

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.000
- that can be collected universally.
- All right.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.760
So now one Birthday Puja.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.320
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.680
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.960
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:04.240
Actual Birthday Puja, this time, is going to be in Australia.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.960
Then there's one they want to have it here,

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.840
and one in Delhi, that is their responsibility.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320
They can have ten if they want to.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.320
Should we pay for the Birthday Puja?

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.160
No, no, no, yours is, now why?

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.680
- Collective
- Collective. Collective.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.840
Means, just now you pay whatever it is, then it will be adjusted.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.080
All right? Birthday must be because you see, Birthday after all.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.080
That will come out of the two hundred they pay for the whole month,

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.080
whole the year?

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.160
Mataji, please excuse me, this 31-st March program,

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.840
Your special Birthday, we wish....

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.960

[Hindi/Marathi].

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.640

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.120

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.600
So, 27-th in Delhi they want to have My Birthday.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.560
27-th in Delhi.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:53.880
Tell Venugopal. Why, because they wanted to have a souvenir.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.680
For the souvenir, only I'm allowing it for souvenir, all right?

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.760
27. And 31-st [Hindi/Marathi] souvenir.

Shri Mataji has selected sarees  for the following centres.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.800
This is in addition to the collective sarees which as

we've just said are for London or for Her Birthday

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.400
and people should make arrangements to collect and settle

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.600
for their sarees as soon as possible,

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.320
with Nicholas. Nicholas will accept the money payment for

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.360

Hundred and fifty-one addition. Now see...

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.400
But the sarees Mother has chosen are absolutely spectacular.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.880
They are the type of saree for which we would pay

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.000
around two thousand maybe two thousand five hundred.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.960
And Mother has found them for an average a round about

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.320
seven-fifty to a thousand. [Hindi/Marathi]

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.720
These sarees
[MARATHI]

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.960

people to take note of this, the national leaders...

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.720
In addition to these costs

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:32.080
there will be a fee for the making and for the blouse

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.880
and for the petticoat and so on which will be one hundred

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.520
