00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.558
Now if you say, “I believe in Shri Mataji” 
- so what?

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:19.182
All right, you believe in me 
because of certain experiences - still what?

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:27.558
Mataji should be in your life, should be in your expression,

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:33.349
in your behaviour, in your treatment to others,

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:37.850
in understanding each other, and loving each other.

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:40.933
That is what impresses people.

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:44.313
People say, “All right, we’ll come to Mataji, we’ll just pray to Her

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:47.936
and go away - we’ll not talk to you.” Why?

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:52.017
“Because we believe in Mataji, finished.”

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.854
So now we have to understand that you believe in Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:56.935 --> 00:01:01.560
of course, it is Shraddha (faith),
 it is not a blind faith, I agreed,

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:05.850
but still belief has to penetrate into your being.

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:10.433
This belief has to act, has to show results,

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:16.433
it has to work out in every way.

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:20.850
Somebody might say that we believe in Mataji 
and She does everything -

00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:23.516
She’ll do bhakti for us.

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:28.474
I should sit down and sing the song of Mataji or what.

00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:36.017
So what is going to come from your side, 
that is what we have to understand;

00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:39.558
and once that starts working, then these demons

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:44.182
and these rakshasas will all vanish, no problem.

00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:48.725
So: “What am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?”

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:52.516
We should ask the question, “What am I doing?”

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:58.641
Now if you make this instrument, 
and then if it is not doing anything,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.599
what is the use of making the instrument?

00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:11.850
Now you are the light, you have got enlightenment:

00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:15.308
but what is the use of a light which is hanging somewhere,

00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:19.017
which is not giving light to anyone?

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:27.224
So when you are giving light to others, in a very innocent manner,

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:32.599
in a very reciprocal manner - not this way that we are giving light

00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:35.891
because we want to have an advantage over it,

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.099
or we want to show off or any all nonsensical things that are there.

00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:43.349
Then the derailment starts.

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:47.808
People start saying, “Oh, I am this, I am that.”

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:55.766
But with full understanding, that we are 
instruments in the hands of the divinity

00:02:55.975 --> 00:03:02.683
and we are just enjoying that divinity 
flowing through us and working out,

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.308
you won’t feel tired, you won’t feel upset,

00:03:05.516 --> 00:03:10.474
you’ll not be in any way in trouble.

00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:14.558
But this has happened with you.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.558
You are so matured, but still, we all have to decide

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:25.808
that now we are going to India to get ourselves 
the whole joy of the tour.

00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:28.808
But for what?

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:34.850
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it with others.

00:03:35.058 --> 00:03:39.850
This joy is for you to share it with others.

00:03:40.058 --> 00:03:45.808
Unless and until you learn that, 
your ego will come back again and again.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:50.808
And also you have seen the way

00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:57.266
people who have been even spreading 
Sahaja Yoga got into the mess of ego.

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:03.058
So one has to be very careful. The more 
you are rising in your divinity,

00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:07.891
the more you are maturing, you have to be very careful.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:15.433
See on a tree if you see, if there’s a leaf, no insect will enter.

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:21.224
If there’s a flower, the insect will come 
and it will make it into a fruit.

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:27.433
But when it is a fruit, then the insect will enter and eat it off.

00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:30.891
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have to be very careful

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.099
that no insect should get into you.

00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:40.516
On the contrary, now you have [the] capacity 
to destroy all the insects.

00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:48.599
And that is what is, I would say, is the state 
where we should all come up to.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.182
So you are destroying insects on one side

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.558
and satisfying people on the other side.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:05:02.308
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, 
is the only way you can be cleansed;

00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:05.975
but the greater thing is to go out, all out, to find out,

00:05:06.182 --> 00:05:09.224
“Where can I spread Sahaja Yoga? Where can I go?

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:13.474
What is the nearest village I can go? Where will I work it out?”

00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:17.017
All those things the more you think, the better it is,

00:05:17.224 --> 00:05:21.683
and you start moving in that direction.

00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:24.863
Once you start moving in that direction, you will be surprised

00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:27.727
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

00:05:27.808 --> 00:05:30.558
You’ll meet the people whom you want,

00:05:30.766 --> 00:05:35.808
you’ll get all the necessary help that you want,

00:05:35.975 --> 00:05:39.058
suddenly you’ll find some people who will come down

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:43.474
and say, “Now, what can we do for you?”

00:05:43.683 --> 00:05:49.182
Every type of help starts coming to you the way you expand yourself.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:54.891
It’s like the expanding your wings, like a bird does,

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:01.975
and then you take off. But if you don’t extend yourself,

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:08.224
you keep Sahaja Yoga to yourself only, it doesn’t work.

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.641
I know you love me very much and you know I love you very much,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.808
but don’t you think others should also share this love,

00:06:20.017 --> 00:06:23.544
others should also have this?

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.028
You are not to be convinced about me, I know.

00:06:27.195 --> 00:06:29.735
But now you have to be convinced about yourself

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:32.772
that you have all the powers within you.

00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:36.278
I mean, I don’t do anything really, to be very frank.

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:41.070
If I could do everything, I would not have had you, 
I would have done it myself.

00:06:41.278 --> 00:06:44.445
But you have to do it - you are my channels.

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:49.903
You are the channels of Shakti. 
But do it in a way which is gracious,

00:06:50.112 --> 00:06:53.862
which is beautiful, which is very satisfying.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.653
Like yesterday, that musician - he just wanted to entertain you.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.820
He wanted to play. I mean, he was enjoying it.

00:07:06.028 --> 00:07:12.278
In the same way, we should want to do it. I don’t have to tell you.

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:17.695
And I am sure, in every area that you work,

00:07:17.903 --> 00:07:22.028
in every personality whom you meet,

00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:25.736
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga and tell them.

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:29.319
It works. It acts.

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:34.611
Moreover, it is behind you the whole power of all the deities,

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.862
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running forward fast, 
this Paramchaitanya:

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.361
“Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming, all right,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.236
let them not eat their food, finished” - organising.

00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:51.445
Everything so beautifully done. Now see the arrangements and all -

00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:57.112
I mean, I was thinking such few people here, 
and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:01.570
can you believe it, all this arrangement?

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:10.070
How it’s working out, how it is giving results, 
it’s really remarkable.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.070
So have faith in yourself, have faith in all of them helping you,

00:08:16.236 --> 00:08:19.486
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:24.278
Because the shakti is in you. You have the power.

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:28.528
Every kind of power you have, I assure you, you have every power.

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:30.736
Ask for it and you’ll have it.

00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:33.486
Whatever you ask for it, it will happen.

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:40.945
But don’t hesitate. As I said the other day, 
that I make you sit on the throne,

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:44.987
then also I put the crown on your head.

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:52.112
And also I say, “Now you are the king,” 
but still you are running away

00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:55.570
and not believing me - looking this side with fear –

00:08:55.778 --> 00:08:58.945
“Am I a king really? How can I be?”

00:08:59.154 --> 00:09:03.319
That’s not the way. Have faith in yourself.
