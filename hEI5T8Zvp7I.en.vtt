WEBVTT

00:12.650 --> 00:26.910
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:26.910 --> 00:37.820
It has to be understood that truth what we
know through our mental capacity is not the

00:37.820 --> 00:48.580
truth, because mind itself is a myth.

00:48.580 --> 00:49.790
We have created it.

00:49.790 --> 00:51.690
As we have created computers.

00:51.690 --> 01:00.660
we have created our myth also through our
conditioning and through our ego.

01:00.660 --> 01:04.220
Beyond it is the reality.

01:04.220 --> 01:11.320
So if you have to know the absolute truth
something has to happen.

01:11.320 --> 01:23.810
We have to evolve into a higher realm of existence
of consciousness.

01:23.810 --> 01:28.250
You have been already told about the subtle
system that you have.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.460
You all have it.

01:29.460 --> 01:37.250
You are the owner of it and you have every
right to achieve that state of consciousness

01:37.250 --> 01:43.240
which in the Zen system call it “Satori”.

01:43.240 --> 01:51.040
In every system they have something they call
it some name, like the Islam calls it “Wali”,

01:51.040 --> 01:55.640
some called it “Sufi”.

01:55.640 --> 02:06.830
In the realm of reality, when we are not,
we have problems, because we fight for unreal

02:06.830 --> 02:13.810
things, you think of unreal thing as real
and accept.

02:13.810 --> 02:22.500
For example, when they English lost the match.

02:22.500 --> 02:27.609
I mean one party has to win, either this or
that.

02:27.609 --> 02:33.079
But they were so much identified with it,
which was falsehood.

02:33.079 --> 02:38.219
They were not playing, there were not players
that they were English, alright.

02:38.219 --> 02:42.260
But there was no war going on.

02:42.260 --> 02:49.159
See the myth about it is this, that we get
identified with things which are themselves

02:49.159 --> 02:51.010
not real.

02:51.010 --> 03:05.099
And all these problems that we see of anger,
which is violence after all, or the attachments

03:05.099 --> 03:14.579
we have, identifications we have, then the
lust and greed and all kinds of problems that

03:14.579 --> 03:21.980
we see in every country is due to our imperfection.

03:21.980 --> 03:28.489
It is due to our ignorance about reality while
reality is beautiful.

03:28.489 --> 03:36.340
And we have to enter into that realm that
is what is seeking for.

03:36.340 --> 03:41.999
The other day I was reading a book of a boy,
who was an athlete and who went through the

03:41.999 --> 03:50.290
Zen system of training and it was so hard
and hazardous that I thought very few would

03:50.290 --> 03:55.200
accept such a situation, very few.

03:55.200 --> 04:00.950
Might have been in those days, there were
seekers of that quality that they worked it

04:00.950 --> 04:01.950
out.

04:01.950 --> 04:06.209
But now there is system available for you.

04:06.209 --> 04:13.709
The knowledge that they gave you about the
subtle system we have is a fact, but if it

04:13.709 --> 04:21.720
is a fact or not you should first verify don’t
just believe me or believe what he has said.

04:21.720 --> 04:29.380
You should verify if it there within us this
subtle system of our ascent.

04:29.380 --> 04:36.659
I knew about this since my childhood, but
I did not know how to explain to people because

04:36.659 --> 04:40.440
I found people have no idea about it even
in India.

04:40.440 --> 04:46.690
Traditionally, in India we had three types
of seekers.

04:46.690 --> 04:49.440
One was through Vedas.

04:49.440 --> 05:02.120
Even the first stanza of Veda says that, “If
you do not know yourself by reading or by

05:02.120 --> 05:07.830
chanting these mantras it is useless”.

05:07.830 --> 05:16.560
Then the second seeking, second style of seeking
was that of bhakti, is you to sing the name

05:16.560 --> 05:23.520
of God, or you can pray to God.

05:23.520 --> 05:30.030
Even great people like Gyanadeva did not know
want to do.

05:30.030 --> 05:37.180
So they also said it is better to do bhakti,
bhakti of God because the time had not come

05:37.180 --> 05:44.349
perhaps to give self-realization or may be
the people were not prepared to get it.

05:44.349 --> 05:52.340
But in the center we had another great movement
which is called as Nath, Nathpanthis.

05:52.340 --> 06:00.220
They say it came from Shiva, but whatever
it is; it came from Adinath and these people

06:00.220 --> 06:04.639
and got diverted into many types.

06:04.639 --> 06:10.990
But those who remained in the middle, one
of them was we should say was called Gahininath

06:10.990 --> 06:16.479
and his disciple was Nivrutinath the elder
brother of Gyanadeva.

06:16.479 --> 06:22.430
It is amazing if you read anything about them
they know all about chakras, they know all

06:22.430 --> 06:25.680
about these all three channels.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.070
Everything they new thousands of years back.

06:29.070 --> 06:33.080
Then somehow or other they didn’t tell people.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.460
They kept the knowledge to themselves.

06:37.460 --> 06:41.129
I can’t say why they did it but they did.

06:41.129 --> 06:48.860
Ultimately, Gyanadeva took permission of his
Guru Nivrutinath and said that let me tell

06:48.860 --> 06:57.400
you, at least let me tell others, you allow
me because people should know what works it

06:57.400 --> 06:58.449
out.

06:58.449 --> 07:01.710
So he wrote about Kundalini.

07:01.710 --> 07:07.090
But if you read these ancient books, you will
be amazed that the whole thing was described

07:07.090 --> 07:13.879
in those books how you get your realization
and how then you have those centers which

07:13.879 --> 07:17.669
are to be enlightened, what problems come
in.

07:17.669 --> 07:24.229
But the method they employed for achieving
it was really hazardous.

07:24.229 --> 07:27.129
I don’t know why they had to do it but they
did it.

07:27.129 --> 07:38.889
They were all unmarried people and very strict
with themselves and they had to lead a life

07:38.889 --> 07:40.002
very secluded from the society.

07:40.002 --> 07:50.219
This was really a very difficult time of ascent
they had.

07:50.219 --> 07:57.960
When I read about them I really feel very
extremely sad that all these great people

07:57.960 --> 08:08.930
who were seeking had to go through such horrible
strenuous turmoil for days together and then

08:08.930 --> 08:11.689
some of them got realisation.

08:11.689 --> 08:19.360
But you are lucky people I should say to be
born at this time.

08:19.360 --> 08:27.009
This is a special time, very special time,
which is described in all the books, all the

08:27.009 --> 08:30.330
scriptures as the last judgment.

08:30.330 --> 08:39.919
Now, if you start deciding about it through
your mental capacity you cannot achieve anything,

08:39.919 --> 08:49.700
because you have only two agencies: one is
your conditioning, another is your ego.

08:49.700 --> 08:58.460
So one has to rely on the natural gifts that
we have, is that of this Kundalini and she

08:58.460 --> 09:05.810
is your individual mother; she does not want
to torture you, she does not want in any way

09:05.810 --> 09:09.040
to give you any pains, whatsoever.

09:09.040 --> 09:17.440
Also, there are some books written that Kundalini
means it is a something horrible and it can

09:17.440 --> 09:19.470
kill you, it will do all these things.

09:19.470 --> 09:24.370
All these years, now I have been working on
it, I have never seen anybody getting into

09:24.370 --> 09:25.370
trouble.

09:25.370 --> 09:27.900
But if you are in trouble you get out of it.

09:27.900 --> 09:34.000
So, all these myths were created for Kundalini
also later on so that people should not take

09:34.000 --> 09:36.100
to reality.

09:36.100 --> 09:50.940
But all this knowledge was somehow lost, though
Gyanadeva had mentioned in his book that in

09:50.940 --> 09:59.930
the sixth chapter he said that one should
seek through the awakening of Kundalini.

09:59.930 --> 10:05.750
But people said no, this is no good, we are
not going to have it; because when those people

10:05.750 --> 10:15.410
who organized the religion, become in charge
of the religion - actually you cannot organize,

10:15.410 --> 10:21.950
you cannot organize religion - and once they
start organizing it you see they put there

10:21.950 --> 10:29.150
own norms on people who are seeking.

10:29.150 --> 10:35.030
So they said no this is something is not allowed
because they could not raise the Kundalini

10:35.030 --> 10:36.840
may be.

10:36.840 --> 10:45.870
But in the sixteenth century in India, suddenly
so many realized souls were born, saints were

10:45.870 --> 10:46.870
born.

10:46.870 --> 10:51.230
Perhaps they might have been Nathpanthis who
had died before may be, they have taken the

10:51.230 --> 11:00.180
birth, so many of them, and they started understanding
each other because they were one with reality.

11:00.180 --> 11:05.060
Everybody was feeling the same thing about
each other.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.780
There are many examples of that.

11:06.780 --> 11:10.270
First of all I would say, Namadeva in Maharastra.

11:10.270 --> 11:21.750
He was a tailor and he went to see one pitcher
- who make pitchers you see, potter you can

11:21.750 --> 11:30.750
call it – and, when he went and saw this
fellow standing and trampling over the clay,

11:30.750 --> 11:37.200
he just stood up and the sentence he said
is so remarkable.

11:37.200 --> 11:45.140
He said,” I came here to see the formless
- that is the vibrations or Chaitnaya they

11:45.140 --> 11:51.650
call it - but I see it in you in person.

11:51.650 --> 11:53.810
It is in person I see it”.

11:53.810 --> 12:00.950
This kind of appreciation is only possible
between people who are realised souls because

12:00.950 --> 12:02.970
they understand each other.

12:02.970 --> 12:08.650
Those who don’t understand you see have
different, different ideas, different, different

12:08.650 --> 12:09.650
things.

12:09.650 --> 12:12.490
Now they say that we must have peace.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.050
How can you have peace?

12:14.050 --> 12:19.330
One is going to the right direction, another
is going to the left direction, another is

12:19.330 --> 12:22.130
going in middle some where hanging.

12:22.130 --> 12:24.780
Everybody think they are right.

12:24.780 --> 12:28.180
Whatever they are doing is right.

12:28.180 --> 12:33.910
But what is the outcome of it.

12:33.910 --> 12:34.970
Nobody is peaceful within.

12:34.970 --> 12:42.260
They are fighting for things which has no
meaning at all in life.

12:42.260 --> 12:47.890
They are many people who are fighting in the
name of God, I mean this is the worse someone

12:47.890 --> 12:51.050
can do stupid thing.

12:51.050 --> 12:54.860
How can you kill each other in the name of
God, how can you?

12:54.860 --> 13:02.680
But this happening is accepted and not only
but it is regarded as religion.

13:02.680 --> 13:07.830
Like this whole world is full of violent people.

13:07.830 --> 13:18.640
You should say minimum disturbed people: families
are disturbed, children are disturbed, the

13:18.640 --> 13:23.950
whole mother earth is shaking and everybody
is disturbed.

13:23.950 --> 13:27.330
By saying that you should have peace you cannot
have.

13:27.330 --> 13:29.770
By talking about you cannot have.

13:29.770 --> 13:36.380
Because I have seen some people who got peace
awards, there is no peace within.

13:36.380 --> 13:45.220
Only by transformation of human beings, by
evolving them, taking them into this realm

13:45.220 --> 13:54.530
of peaceful existence of reality you can bring
peace.

13:54.530 --> 14:02.110
Everybody wants peace but even if you want
you should genuinely ask for it.

14:02.110 --> 14:06.640
If you are going to decide it mentally you
cannot.

14:06.640 --> 14:14.350
Mentally everybody differs, everybody has
opinion for everything.

14:14.350 --> 14:18.940
Like they will say, now they have come here.

14:18.940 --> 14:22.730
I mean the modern mind is like this.

14:22.730 --> 14:28.030
It always tries to runaway from the truth,
always.

14:28.030 --> 14:33.570
If you, I will give simple example, if I tell
somebody to please telephone to such and such

14:33.570 --> 14:37.440
gentlemen, immediately the other person will
say, “He may not be there.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.940
He might have gone to his office.”

14:38.940 --> 14:41.180
Today is Sunday how can he go to his office.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.339
“Alright, then he might be...”

14:42.339 --> 14:47.070
I said, “Why don’t you telephone first,
why do you react?

14:47.070 --> 14:49.980
First telephone, finds if the person is there
or not.”

14:49.980 --> 14:55.190
But that is not possible because the mind
is all the time wobbling, giving answers and

14:55.190 --> 14:56.190
reacting.

14:56.190 --> 14:58.030
Whatever you do, there is reaction.

14:58.030 --> 15:03.110
It can also say now why so many flowers, I
never asked them but they did put it also.

15:03.110 --> 15:06.220
I don’t know whom to be blamed, who is the
victim.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.100
But they might say so.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.810
They can have objection to everything.

15:11.810 --> 15:18.960
But one thing is that why don’t you understand
that you are not at peace, at peace with your

15:18.960 --> 15:19.960
self.

15:19.960 --> 15:28.610
Unless and until you are yourself at piece, you
cannot find faults with others.

15:28.610 --> 15:31.860
You cannot judge others.

15:31.860 --> 15:34.420
Why are you not at peace with yourself?

15:34.420 --> 15:41.550
(This is the thing one should understand)
Because you are not integrated.

15:41.550 --> 15:50.600
Your mind, which is I have told you what it
is, says something then your heart says something

15:50.600 --> 15:54.880
and then your liver says something.

15:54.880 --> 16:01.080
There is no integration in your understanding
of any problem.

16:01.080 --> 16:08.470
Once you are completely integrated then you
feel the peace.

16:08.470 --> 16:13.870
But the best thing that happens I have seen
with Kundalini awakening is this.

16:13.870 --> 16:18.450
We are all the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
and thinking so much.

16:18.450 --> 16:23.830
Some people really have told me that "You cut
our throat, but stop this thinking".

16:23.830 --> 16:27.030
Specially in modem times we think much more
for everything.

16:27.030 --> 16:37.560
I think without thinking we will be lost and
in this ocean of thinking, we are so frightened

16:37.560 --> 16:44.900
with the waves, as if you are in the ocean
and there are waves around you and you are

16:44.900 --> 16:46.560
very much frightened of them.

16:46.560 --> 16:53.970
But supposing by any chance you get into
a boat then you can watch these waves which

16:53.970 --> 17:01.901
were frightening you and enjoy them; but supposing
you become an expert swimmer you can jump

17:01.901 --> 17:03.770
down and save many.

17:03.770 --> 17:06.679
In the same way it happens.

17:06.679 --> 17:12.950
When Kundalini rises these waves that we have
of a thought which rises and falls, rises

17:12.950 --> 17:22.030
and falls, and we are all the time jumping
on the cusp of the thoughts, either in the

17:22.030 --> 17:23.030
past or in the future.

17:23.030 --> 17:24.680
We cannot be in the present.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.460
So when she rises, she elongates those thoughts.

17:28.460 --> 17:36.140
And there is a space in between that is the present
and in the present we don’t think but we

17:36.140 --> 17:40.450
are aware, much more aware than we were ever.

17:40.450 --> 17:50.660
We are in the center, we are in the center
and there it is our peace.

17:50.660 --> 17:54.310
So we have to rise up to that point.

17:54.310 --> 17:59.420
Now - as he has told you about all these centers
- when the Kundalini passes through them she

17:59.420 --> 18:01.790
nourishes all of them.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.690
These centers are responsible for our physical
mental, emotional, also our spiritual being.

18:05.690 --> 18:15.400
So she nourishes them, integrates them and
ultimately pierces through our fontanel bone

18:15.400 --> 18:20.920
area and connects us to this all pervading
power of divine love.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.060
All the scriptures have described about this
thing.

18:24.060 --> 18:29.760
they call it by different names, as I have
told you that they call it “Ruh”, they

18:29.760 --> 18:37.020
call it “cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”,
they call it as the “all pervading power

18:37.020 --> 18:45.630
of divine love”, all kinds of names like
“Param Chaitnya” as “Nirakar” they

18:45.630 --> 18:48.240
call it “Alakh niranjan”.

18:48.240 --> 18:55.480
All kinds of names they have given to this
all pervading power because you can see it,

18:55.480 --> 19:01.920
you can see it and you can feel it after realisation.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.110
You can feel it, it exist.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.320
For the first time you feel it.

19:06.320 --> 19:11.560
You see these flowers you take them for granted
how beautiful they are.

19:11.560 --> 19:19.440
But it is a miracle, just think it, how beautifully
this mother earth has created for you all

19:19.440 --> 19:20.820
these.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.900
That means she is living organism.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.840
She understands what to produce out of what
to do.?

19:25.840 --> 19:30.710
Who does all this?

19:30.710 --> 19:32.040
What is this energy?

19:32.040 --> 19:36.850
This is the energy of divine Love.

19:36.850 --> 19:42.300
When I say “Love”, I mean compassion,
it is the compassion.

19:42.300 --> 19:51.190
It is a thing we don’t understand that how
can compassion be the truth.

19:51.190 --> 19:55.551
But on a little lower level we can understand
it.

19:55.551 --> 20:00.160
If you love somebody then you know everything
about that person.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.360
Take it that way.

20:03.360 --> 20:11.710
Compassion is real intelligence.

20:11.710 --> 20:24.090
Which gives you the, I mean, enlightened compassion,
the complete idea of the totality, it does

20:24.090 --> 20:29.490
not talk of one here and one there but of
the totality it has.

20:29.490 --> 20:38.440
Through its intelligence it understands what
is benevolent for the global peace, what is

20:38.440 --> 20:42.580
benevolent for an individual problem.

20:42.580 --> 20:50.860
It understands everything, because it hasn’t
got any angularities.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.840
It is so pure.

20:52.840 --> 21:02.630
And this purity, which is compassion, which
is pure intelligence.

21:02.630 --> 21:10.640
And once you enter into that realm you don’t
have to read anything.

21:10.640 --> 21:18.680
You become just very knowledgeable, yourself
very knowledgeable.

21:18.680 --> 21:28.010
So many powers you have within yourself, of
which you are not at all aware they all start

21:28.010 --> 21:29.010
manifesting.

21:29.010 --> 21:37.560
I have known people, ordinary artist coming
to Sahajayoga become now world famous artist.

21:37.560 --> 21:44.230
Ordinary people who could not even come up
on the stage have become great orators.

21:44.230 --> 21:55.000
All these qualities which make you so special
just start prospering and also manifesting

21:55.000 --> 21:56.530
itself.

21:56.530 --> 22:04.020
But that’s not, that’s like you see mother
giving chocolate for children, that is not

22:04.020 --> 22:05.750
the main thing.

22:05.750 --> 22:12.400
The main thing is that you reach a point that
you feel you don’t have to achieve any thing.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.760
You have achieved everything.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.250
All that hankering after achievement and all
that is finished.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.750
Then you enjoy everything.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.990
Your existence you enjoy.

22:23.990 --> 22:27.550
You enjoy each and everything that you see.

22:27.550 --> 22:29.660
This enjoyment cannot be described.

22:29.660 --> 22:36.230
But it is to be experienced and to be felt.

22:36.230 --> 22:41.750
I must say In England I worked the most because
somehow my husband is posted here and lot

22:41.750 --> 22:47.650
of time and the country which I had worked
very hard is England, no doubt.

22:47.650 --> 22:54.120
And I had an advantage of this English language
which I could speak also.

22:54.120 --> 22:59.520
But I have seen that, once English take to
something, they will take it seriously.

22:59.520 --> 23:08.240
But to take them to something is difficult,
because too much of mental activity.

23:08.240 --> 23:15.530
We have to go humbly beyond this.

23:15.530 --> 23:19.691
Because they will say, I don’t like this,
I did not like this I don’t want this.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.990
That is not the thing.

23:21.990 --> 23:24.100
Who are you?

23:24.100 --> 23:28.320
Do you know who you are?

23:28.320 --> 23:32.130
I want this, I believe, our politicians will
always say I believe, now who are you?

23:32.130 --> 23:39.670
Do you know who you are? Mohammad Sahib has
said, “Unless and until you know yourself

23:39.670 --> 23:43.150
you can not know God Almighty.

23:43.150 --> 23:44.220
So why talk of God?

23:44.220 --> 23:45.220
First know yourself.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.960
That’s why Buddha never talked of God.

23:47.960 --> 23:56.360
He said better not talk of God First know
yourself, because, you haven’t got yet,

23:56.360 --> 24:00.440
the capacity to understand God.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.510
First of all you must know yourself.

24:03.510 --> 24:07.090
And to know yourself is quite easy now days.

24:07.090 --> 24:14.040
I am amazed the way it worked in so many nations,
the way people have taken to Sahajayoga and

24:14.040 --> 24:20.390
the way it is spreading, I am amazed; this
is the special time and a special blessing

24:20.390 --> 24:24.580
where you are born when it was to happen.

24:24.580 --> 24:31.390
But, still it’s a judgment; again I will
say it’s a judgment.

24:31.390 --> 24:35.340
Nobody can force you.

24:35.340 --> 24:41.620
You have to judge yourself whether you want
it or not.

24:41.620 --> 24:45.630
There cannot be any forcing.

24:45.630 --> 24:51.360
But you see, this countries also, European
countries I have some ideas, they think it

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
is a cult.

24:52.360 --> 24:57.140
I mean I can not understand how can there
be a cult when where there are no weapons

24:57.140 --> 25:03.440
used, there is no money taken, there is nothing
as such peace such joy, such friendship among

25:03.440 --> 25:06.160
so many nations its established.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.410
If it is cult alright, does not matter.

25:08.410 --> 25:11.059
I wish there were some more like that!

25:11.059 --> 25:16.780
This mind all the time criticizing, finding
fault, this and that.

25:16.780 --> 25:19.390
But what have you got so far.

25:19.390 --> 25:25.520
As a Mother, I will say you have to be selfish.

25:25.520 --> 25:32.040
Just know that you have to know yourself and
that is what will give you everything that

25:32.040 --> 25:33.690
you want.

25:33.690 --> 25:35.460
Actually the wants also change.

25:35.460 --> 25:42.690
It is very surprising how after Sahaja yoga
people change.

25:42.690 --> 25:49.230
Of course there are one or two here and there
who are not so good.

25:49.230 --> 25:57.140
But they will be, they will be, they have
certain hankering, something hanging in there

25:57.140 --> 25:58.280
minds I think.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.410
But most of them come up so fast.

26:01.410 --> 26:07.190
I am really amazed, how these things are happening
in the western countries.

26:07.190 --> 26:11.750
India, of course, no problem, because they
have the heritage, they have the knowledge

26:11.750 --> 26:15.360
they know everything, they know what they
have to get.

26:15.360 --> 26:21.950
But here in England, I was really amazed,
how it has worked out.

26:21.950 --> 26:30.520
So seekers are born every where, I see now
this seeking is so deep and so much maddening

26:30.520 --> 26:31.910
for people.

26:31.910 --> 26:34.790
Of course many people have made money out
of it.

26:34.790 --> 26:37.740
That’s where I can’t understand.

26:37.740 --> 26:42.960
They have made marketing thing, you cannot
market, you see, this is your evolutionary

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
process.

26:43.960 --> 26:49.010
How much money do we go give to mother earth
for giving us these flowers?

26:49.010 --> 26:55.720
It is natural process of evolution, which
has to take place in simple words it is “Sahaja”.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.280
Sahaja means spontaneous.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.380
It’s born with you.

26:59.380 --> 27:05.280
It is a great chance of becoming sahaja yogis.

27:05.280 --> 27:10.070
“Yoga” means the union with the Divine.

27:10.070 --> 27:18.130
You get powers, it is not just to say I am
twice born have some sort of sign board; but

27:18.130 --> 27:19.170
you become.

27:19.170 --> 27:23.980
Is the becoming is the point.

27:23.980 --> 27:29.250
You really become and in that becoming you
get powers, you can raise the Kundalini of

27:29.250 --> 27:31.290
others you can cure people.

27:31.290 --> 27:34.870
I mean so many things happen.

27:34.870 --> 27:44.640
The greatest thing happens is that such a
person become extremely peaceful, wise and

27:44.640 --> 27:46.670
enjoyable.

27:46.670 --> 27:52.930
As Namadeva enjoyed, Gora Kumbhar they enjoyed
each other.

27:52.930 --> 28:02.750
Then Namdeva went to Punjab where Guru Nanaka:
he saw another realized soul, immediately

28:02.750 --> 28:10.270
he recognized, and he said “It is so nice
you come to Punjab, now you better learn Punjabi

28:10.270 --> 28:14.690
language and write beautiful poetry as you
done it in Marathi language.”

28:14.690 --> 28:19.330
So there is such a big book written in Punjabi
language by this great poet.

28:19.330 --> 28:26.181
You too had great poets here, there is Lewis,
then we have William Blake.

28:26.181 --> 28:29.350
William Blake was unknown to us in India.

28:29.350 --> 28:34.960
They never, they thought he’d be a mad man
or what I don’t know.

28:34.960 --> 28:40.950
After coming to London only I could discuss
something about him such a great man, such

28:40.950 --> 28:42.320
a great poet.

28:42.320 --> 28:48.120
But they had to write it in this poetry, because
if they were saying something, they would

28:48.120 --> 28:52.679
have been murdered or killed, I don’t know
what would have happened.

28:52.679 --> 28:59.640
So they wrote it in poetry when people couldn’t
understand much.

28:59.640 --> 29:03.440
They have [not clear] way for us.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.800
They have created this path.

29:06.800 --> 29:15.210
For them the greatest thing is that it is
working out because they are all together.

29:15.210 --> 29:21.440
First so many came, trying this, and else
you see build the path.

29:21.440 --> 29:30.570
Now, it iss complete, not only that, but also
the temple is ready for you to enter in.

29:30.570 --> 29:36.670
The whole work of this great people has helped
us.

29:36.670 --> 29:39.520
They were never against each other, Never.

29:39.520 --> 29:51.510
When they talk different religions I can’t
understand specially, when Moses, Abraham,

29:51.510 --> 29:54.230
were described by Christ.

29:54.230 --> 29:59.610
How come the Jews fighting Christians, I can’t
understand?

29:59.610 --> 30:05.429
Not only but also Mohammed sahib described
about Christ, his mother, much more with greater

30:05.429 --> 30:10.049
respect than in the Bible.

30:10.049 --> 30:14.560
So how can this people fight among themselves?

30:14.560 --> 30:21.040
It is to be seen clearly in their books only,
they find the books so authentic it is in

30:21.040 --> 30:26.450
the book written down that they followed all
these great people.

30:26.450 --> 30:31.610
So there cannot be any devising thing that
is a religion.

30:31.610 --> 30:33.420
Religion cannot divide.

30:33.420 --> 30:36.170
Actually religion is within ourselves.

30:36.170 --> 30:43.559
And when you get your realization you suddenly
become very righteous, suddenly.

30:43.559 --> 30:51.540
I have see in this England only, people taking
drugs and all that overnight gave up, overnight.

30:51.540 --> 30:58.679
It is remarkable how in the light of the spirit
they saw what is wrong with them, what is

30:58.679 --> 31:01.190
destructive and they just gave it up.

31:01.190 --> 31:04.390
Such beautiful people have come up.

31:04.390 --> 31:12.679
You won’t believe that these were the people
who lost all hopes about themselves and how

31:12.679 --> 31:21.330
now they have become such beautiful beings,
I am very proud of them.

31:21.330 --> 31:25.110
This lecture of mine should not upset you
in any way.

31:25.110 --> 31:32.080
If I have said something that makes you feel
little nervous or any thing, you should not

31:32.080 --> 31:33.630
worry.

31:33.630 --> 31:39.820
Because your Kundalini is all the time there
and innocence cannot be destroyed.

31:39.820 --> 31:45.700
Of course some clouds come over it but there
is the deity of innocence sitting within you

31:45.700 --> 31:49.990
and it holds everything works out without
any problem.

31:49.990 --> 31:53.820
Only thing you have to desire for it and asked
for it.

31:53.820 --> 31:55.669
As I said it can not be forced.

31:55.669 --> 32:01.340
I respect your freedom, and in your freedom
you need to receive your self realisation.

32:01.340 --> 32:06.710
It cannot be forced, it cannot be argued,
nothing of the kind; because it is natural

32:06.710 --> 32:15.690
process as I said, is a natural process, and
for the natural process how can you argue

32:15.690 --> 32:17.160
it.

32:17.160 --> 32:26.430
So, I would request you, first of all, that
those who do not want to have Self Realization

32:26.430 --> 32:28.100
should leave the hall.

32:28.100 --> 32:31.480
Because it will take hardly 10 minutes, hardly
10 minutes.

32:31.480 --> 32:45.030
But those who don’t want should leave the
hall, would be nice, very amicably, I will

32:45.030 --> 32:55.290
be thankful.

32:55.290 --> 33:15.809
[Pause for some minute]

33:15.809 --> 33:23.900
One thing I have to tell you that there are
mainly two problems with human beings where

33:23.900 --> 33:33.490
Kundalini stops: one of them when you feel
guilty.

33:33.490 --> 33:39.710
When somebody tells you, you are sinner or
something like that, such an idea crops into

33:39.710 --> 33:45.820
your head, and you think you are sinner and
they are afraid.

33:45.820 --> 33:49.490
Many people have told me, “We are afraid
of you.”

33:49.490 --> 33:54.100
I said “Why?”Because you have sinned…
that’s why I am here, why you should be

33:54.100 --> 33:55.490
afraid.

33:55.490 --> 34:01.370
So first thing is that I love you all and
you all should love yourself.

34:01.370 --> 34:07.480
Because you all are human beings and at the
epitome of the evolution.

34:07.480 --> 34:12.570
So please give up the idea of feeling guilty.

34:12.570 --> 34:16.020
Alright, you have done something wrong, accept
it.

34:16.020 --> 34:21.010
That is finished now that is past and I am
talking about present.

34:21.010 --> 34:23.299
That is finished.

34:23.299 --> 34:28.389
As far as this moment is concerned, it is
doesn’t exist.

34:28.389 --> 34:39.729
So, don’t think of what you have done wrong
or what you have been worried about and all

34:39.729 --> 34:41.749
the time thinking.

34:41.749 --> 34:52.339
Also our modern life is so much, full of norms
that even a little thing you do like, even

34:52.339 --> 34:54.173
if you put the spoon on this side to that
side, you feel guilty.

34:54.173 --> 34:59.849
Oh I did like that.

34:59.849 --> 35:02.569
If you were really guilty, you would have
been in jail not here.

35:02.569 --> 35:08.720
You should have very pleasant attitude towards
yourself and not to feel guilty.

35:08.720 --> 35:17.119
That is what I am requesting you again and
again don’t feel guilty.

35:17.119 --> 35:22.279
Then the second thing is why I say so.

35:22.279 --> 35:25.130
Because this center [left Vishuddhi] here
left side catches.

35:25.130 --> 35:33.630
It goes into very big jeopardy, into very
big problem and this center can give you spondylitis

35:33.630 --> 35:41.989
to minimum, or angina or all your organs become
very lethargic.

35:41.989 --> 35:45.309
So why carry this guilt with you?

35:45.309 --> 35:54.839
So give up the guilt.

35:54.839 --> 36:02.549
The second simple thing is that please forgive
everyone, in general.

36:02.549 --> 36:03.830
Don’t think about them.

36:03.830 --> 36:08.890
If you don’t forgive then you go on thinking,
“Oh my goodness he troubled me” like this

36:08.890 --> 36:13.979
and the person who has troubled you is quite
happy while you are just troubling yourself.

36:13.979 --> 36:19.829
By that you catch on the Agyna which is in
the center of this optic chiasm like this.

36:19.829 --> 36:26.411
And it is so close and so constricted, that
if you want forgive it want open and how will

36:26.411 --> 36:28.400
the Kundalini pass through?

36:28.400 --> 36:33.079
So just forgive all of them and don’t think
about to whom you have to forgive.

36:33.079 --> 36:38.970
Just say in general, I forgive everyone.

36:38.970 --> 36:45.829
Many people say it is difficult, it’s a
myth.

36:45.829 --> 36:49.509
You forgive or you don’t forgive what do
you do, do nothing.

36:49.509 --> 36:53.010
But when you don’t forgive then the all
problems start.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.559
So better forgive everyone.

36:55.559 --> 37:02.229
Without even thinking that you have to forgive
this person or that person.

37:02.229 --> 37:07.180
It is headache even to think about them so
better not.

37:07.180 --> 37:14.710
This center is very important, specially for
Christians.

37:14.710 --> 37:25.640
You know that how forgiveness was [not clear]
that Christ has manifested and requested all

37:25.640 --> 37:31.979
of you to forgive.

37:31.979 --> 37:39.190
The third thing I have to request is that
have full faith in yourself that you are all

37:39.190 --> 37:42.349
going to get your self realisation.

37:42.349 --> 37:45.700
Please have this faith in yourself.

37:45.700 --> 37:50.059
If you have that faith it will workout.

37:50.059 --> 37:55.289
In no way condemn yourself or say that how
could I get it.

37:55.289 --> 38:06.130
In Genoa it happened, it was not such a big
hall but quite a big hall and everybody got

38:06.130 --> 38:07.130
realisation.

38:07.130 --> 38:12.940
And for at least half of they were stunt they
couldn’t believe that they were feeling

38:12.940 --> 38:20.740
the cool breeze of Holy Ghost, they just could
not believe it, for a half a minute.

38:20.740 --> 38:26.769

helps us a lot.
