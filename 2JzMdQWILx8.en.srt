1
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,837
We all have today gathered here

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,753
on top of this beautiful mountain,

3
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:17,170
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

4
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:22,129
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

5
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:28,546
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

6
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,920
by which He showed

7
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:36,586
that the spirit does not die.

8
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:41,379
He was – He was the Omkara,

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,129
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,296
and that is why He could walk on the water.

11
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:58,170
And also now we have made a film

12
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:03,753
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

13
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:07,296
which shows the carbon atom,

14
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:11,586
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

15
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:15,546
you find a proper swastika there;

16
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:21,296
and left to the right we see Omkara.

17
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:24,296
But when you see from down below upward,

18
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:28,296
what you see is alpha and omega.

19
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:33,170
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

20
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:36,837
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

21
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:43,712
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

22
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:48,087
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

23
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:54,087
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

24
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:59,045
I don’t know at the time of Christ

25
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:03,212
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

26
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:05,837
but definitely to Him

27
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:10,962
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

28
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:24,004
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

29
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:29,712
and very important for our ascent.

30
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:34,628
If He had not resurrected Himself,

31
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:39,170
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

32
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,587
So it’s a great contribution.

33
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:47,837
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

34
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:51,795
what you were before

35
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,379
and what you are today.

36
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:01,296
It is such a change,

37
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,837
such a difference,

38
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,087
such a transformation.

39
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:11,546
It is His own sacrifice

40
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,462
on the cross

41
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:17,462
and His own

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,504
beautiful resurrection

43
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:24,004
has created a way for all of us

44
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:29,586
to get into this new transformed state.

45
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:40,212
In this state is a different story for human beings,

46
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:43,045
and a different for Christ.

47
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,462
Christ was Himself

48
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:49,962
was holiness, was purity.

49
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,920
So His resurrection

50
00:03:54,212 --> 00:04:00,670
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

51
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:06,170
because He did not need transformation,

52
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:09,753
He did not

53
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:14,546
have to go through any cleansing.

54
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:19,337
But what happened in His case

55
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:25,129
was that He became

56
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,795
resurrected from death

57
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:34,837
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

58
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:37,795
is like a death;

59
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,170
because they do everything

60
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:46,129
without any understanding about the totality,

61
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:49,504
about the reality,

62
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:52,878
about the absolute truth.

63
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,462
Whatever they do ultimately

64
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,962
takes them to their destruction.

65
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:04,962
Even the religions which are established

66
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,421
by these great incarnations

67
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:12,212
are absolutely on a decline.

68
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:16,587
You do not find any trace of religious life

69
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:18,504
with all those people

70
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:21,712
who claim that they are the ones

71
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,837
who can represent those incarnations.

72
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:29,587
If you see in a subtle way

73
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:31,920
it’s very painful also,

74
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:36,421
that in the name of all these great incarnations

75
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,337
the kind of work people are doing,

76
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:44,296
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

77
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:47,586
because they have no fear of God.

78
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:51,087
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

79
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,087
all over the world.

80
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,504
Of course here,

81
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:56,712
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

82
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,962
Everywhere people are seeing

83
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,628
all these false things have been exposed.

84
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:06,878
But these false things they have used

85
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:11,337
under a garb of God,

86
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,546
spirituality and beauty.

87
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:18,170
That’s the best way you can hide.

88
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,670
All the cruelty, all the violence,

89
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,504
all the ugliness

90
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,837
– this is how they have worked it out.

91
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:34,920
And it has gone into such a state

92
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:38,337
that you do not find the slightest

93
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:43,212
even tinge of religious life among these people.

94
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:45,628
Like all the thieves of the world,

95
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,920
all the great crooks of the world

96
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:51,920
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

97
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,462
It’s only because what was written in all the books

98
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:02,628
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

99
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,587
was never done.

100
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,586
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

101
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:14,421
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

102
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:17,212
He also said that “You are to be born again”

103
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:20,504
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

104
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:26,337
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

105
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,628
But they don’t think that actually

106
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:33,587
what benevolence it has given them.

107
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,837
At the most they might have made some money,

108
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:39,628
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

109
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:46,004
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

110
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:52,753
One must pity their insanity,

111
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:57,212
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

112
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:59,129
or to anybody else’s life

113
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:03,837
of such a noble and a higher value system,

114
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:10,337
and are doing all very low-graded things.

115
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:17,504
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

116
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:21,670
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

117
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:26,379
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

118
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:31,379
that you are coming from that environment,

119
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:34,586
that style of life,

120
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,212
that kind of thinking

121
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,795
which was all for your destruction.

122
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,462
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

123
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,504
So when you’re coming out of it,

124
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:50,962
still these things hang over,

125
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,337
still you get affected by them.

126
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,546
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

127
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:03,129
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

128
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:06,004
to some sort of a funny situation,

129
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:11,795
to some sort of a degrading things.

130
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,254
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

131
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,504
sometimes you accept all that.

132
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:21,296
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

133
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,379
that after coming to realization

134
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:26,795
he has to be very introspective.

135
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:29,045
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

136
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:33,170
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

137
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:37,920
It’s very important that you have to know

138
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:42,254
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

139
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,129
Because Christ did not need this,

140
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,462
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

141
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:58,296
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

142
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,462
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

143
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:08,129
on the sense that from He died

144
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:11,628
and then He resurrected Himself.

145
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,337
But for us it is very different.

146
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:18,753
We are now Sahaja yogis,

147
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:22,628
but we were ordinary human beings.

148
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,504
We had no light within us.

149
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:27,920
Now the light comes within us

150
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,586
and we see the light,

151
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,296
then what do we become?

152
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,170
We have to become the light itself.

153
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:40,337
Christ was the light.

154
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,254
He did not have to become.

155
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,587
So we have to become the light.

156
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,795
And now you have to guard on

157
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,254
the way this light might get disturbed,

158
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:58,920
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

159
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:05,045
So carrying on yourself with this light,

160
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,753
first thing you should know that

161
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,421
if you see the light, is not proper

162
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,087
– means you are not the light.

163
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:15,920
You have to become the light.

164
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,753
When you are the light,

165
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,795
then in that light you can easily see

166
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:24,628
how your mind works,

167
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,212
what ideas it gives,

168
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:34,129
what affects your mind

169
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:36,795
while you’re ascending.

170
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,045
Is this the worry

171
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:44,837
or is this the responsibility that you have?

172
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:49,462
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

173
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:51,628
that there is an impediment

174
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:57,129
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

175
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,586
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

176
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:05,962
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

177
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:10,462
It’s a very beautiful journey

178
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:12,546
– very, very beautiful journey.

179
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:15,212
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

180
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:20,212
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

181
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:26,462
the journey of kundalini.

182
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:36,170
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

183
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:42,546
Basically you were not a realized soul,

184
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,795
but now you are a realized soul.

185
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,170
You are a evolved state.

186
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:54,379
Now what is missing is the idea

187
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:59,795
that we are absolutely all right

188
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:04,587
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

189
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:10,628
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

190
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,795
it’s not going to help you at all.

191
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:17,296
What you have to do is to

192
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,920
all the time introspect yourself.

193
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:22,504
That’s what is meditation for,

194
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,421
to see for yourself

195
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:28,878
how you are keeping up

196
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,546
your spiritual ascent.

197
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,462
No one else can do it,

198
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:37,296
it’s your own individual work.

199
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,546
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

200
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:42,587
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

201
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:46,712
They may not say, they may not refer it,

202
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,586
but they will know definitely

203
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,712
that such-and-such chakra is catching

204
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:53,045
and this person has this problem.

205
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:58,170
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

206
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:02,670
what is their problem is.

207
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,129
So if somebody tells you

208
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:07,379
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

209
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,379
you should never, never feel bad about it,

210
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:13,421
because by keeping that chakra intact

211
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,628
you are ruining your own life.

212
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,586
So what you have to do is to see

213
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,712
that if somebody tells you that

214
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:26,004
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

215
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,962
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

216
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,962
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

217
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,504
there’s something wrong with your face,

218
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,212
you can immediately correct it.

219
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:40,212
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

220
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:44,004
you have to be mature enough that you should know

221
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:46,004
that it is a great blessing

222
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:49,504
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

223
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:52,170
Like the other day there was some quarrel

224
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:53,920
between the two leaders.

225
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:56,753
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

226
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,337
There should not be.

227
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:02,129
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

228
00:15:02,504 --> 00:15:03,795
two legs do not fight.

229
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,087
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

230
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:11,628
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

231
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:15,212
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

232
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:20,170
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

233
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,212
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

234
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,878
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

235
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:28,878
When he puts his hand towards Me,

236
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,170
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

237
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,712
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

238
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:38,920
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

239
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:41,421
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

240
00:15:41,753 --> 00:15:45,462
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

241
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:51,546
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

242
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,462
because I said it to him.

243
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,045
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

244
00:15:58,546 --> 00:16:00,379
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

245
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:01,837
what is good for him.

246
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,587
He did not feel bad at all.

247
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,087
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

248
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:09,254
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

249
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:14,004
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

250
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:24,587
Now, the problem with us is that

251
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,212
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

252
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:32,712
and we have consolidated it.

253
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:35,212
Also, we have a great collective force,

254
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:38,087
I can see, in every country.

255
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,254
We can give realizations to so many,

256
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:44,254
and we can really establish

257
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,379
all these great truths in our lives.

258
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,212
We can do it.

259
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:55,087
All the time we should establish them.

260
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:59,254
But there is one point

261
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:02,712
on which one should not be very sure:

262
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:09,337
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

263
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:13,004
You have to be careful on this point very much.

264
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:19,212
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

265
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:24,296
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

266
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,712
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

267
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:32,504
The reason is that they have no faith

268
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:39,462
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

269
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:43,546
This is the faith which is missing.

270
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:48,753
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

271
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:53,712
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

272
00:17:55,462 --> 00:18:02,045
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

273
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:09,753
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

274
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:11,878
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

275
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,296
– you have known that it is so.

276
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,296
But even knowing that,

277
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:20,129
it has not become such a faith within you.

278
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:24,379
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

279
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:27,254
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

280
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,087
not the blind faith.

281
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:32,920
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

282
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:37,462
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

283
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:42,712
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

284
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,337
There cannot be any problems

285
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:49,170
if your faith is enlightened.

286
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,837
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

287
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:56,670
many people who are very steady,

288
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:01,587
who are upright,

289
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:04,462
who are very valuable.

290
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,795
They are like the people

291
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,337
who know they are standing on the rocks.

292
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:14,920
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

293
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:18,337
they think they are still dwindling

294
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:24,421
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

295
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:30,628
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

296
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,254
and also that has come out of faith

297
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:38,753
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

298
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,753
nothing can trouble us.

299
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:45,587
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

300
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:47,670
I mean, He knew everything,

301
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:50,087
so He was sure about it.

302
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:54,254
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

303
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:58,296
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

304
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:01,337
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

305
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:04,504
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

306
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:06,753
It is so.

307
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:11,421
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

308
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,254
while the other people,

309
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,878
even Sahaja yogis,

310
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:23,546
have to become like Christ

311
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:26,795
as far as the faith is concerned.

312
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:31,753
This faith is to be understood.

313
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,379
This is an enlightened faith.

314
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:40,087
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

315
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,962
He went into all kinds of things,

316
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:47,379
just because He knew it was just a drama

317
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:52,004
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

318
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:55,753
and there’s nothing serious,

319
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:57,920
nothing is going to matter,

320
00:20:58,254 --> 00:20:59,753
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

321
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:02,379
He played the drama.

322
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:06,337
To Him it was nothing very serious.

323
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:12,586
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

324
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:17,337
He also in His heart knew everything that

325
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:21,712
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

326
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:26,586
But at the same time,

327
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:30,504
He was the embodiment of faith:

328
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:35,504
faith in Himself

329
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:39,586
and in this all-pervading Power.

330
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:43,296
This never lets you down,

331
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:48,670
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

332
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:54,129
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

333
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:59,462
naturally I will give him all the work,

334
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:02,379
I will trust everything,

335
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:05,712
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

336
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:09,337
never doubt such a person.

337
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:15,753
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

338
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:23,212
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

339
00:22:24,004 --> 00:22:28,129
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

340
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,712
how life will improve

341
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:37,296
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

342
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:40,129
You’ll have no doubts,

343
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:45,254
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

344
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:52,045
So, this is such a state

345
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,296
– only with faith.

346
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:57,546
But now this faith, how do you get?

347
00:22:57,962 --> 00:23:02,129
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

348
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:03,920
There’s no course about it,

349
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:06,129
there’s no literature about it,

350
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:08,753
there’s no lecture about it.

351
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,628
But there is an awakening within you

352
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:19,129
which will ask this

353
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:22,170
“What am I?” – this awakening,

354
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:24,962
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

355
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:30,795
You see, this will question

356
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,670
“What is it that I have achieved?

357
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:40,337
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

358
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,379
All these questions will come to you.

359
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:45,920
But if you have faith,

360
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,753
not the blind but the enlightened

361
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:51,712
which is established by many miracles in life,

362
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:53,212
many things in life;

363
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:56,379
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

364
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:57,920
small, small things.

365
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:00,337
There have been miracles even in big things,

366
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:04,462
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

367
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,504
So now you know, very well settled,

368
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,421
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

369
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:13,504
For example, it starts raining.

370
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:17,087
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

371
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:20,129
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

372
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:21,712
nothing can happen.

373
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,254
Let it rain as much as it likes.

374
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:28,379
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

375
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:30,462
it’s not going to drench us.

376
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:35,962
In the same way this faith within us

377
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:40,045
has to be absolutely solid,

378
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:44,712
and that makes you extremely strong

379
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,587
and makes you responsible

380
00:24:47,962 --> 00:24:50,212
for the resurrection of thousands

381
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:55,004
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

382
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:04,421
This kind of life that we have

383
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:11,504
– that only by our own establishment,

384
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:15,587
by our own understanding,

385
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:21,628
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

386
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,212
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

387
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:29,795
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

388
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:34,379
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

389
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:39,004
You all should have the chance

390
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:43,170
to know your spirit

391
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:47,795
and to know yourself.

392
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:51,254
So one has to have faith in oneself.

393
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:53,920
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

394
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:57,296
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

395
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:01,670
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

396
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,753
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

397
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:12,379
What do you want?

398
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:17,045
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

399
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:21,004
even if you don’t ask.

400
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:26,962
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

401
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,878
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

402
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:33,920
because this all-pervading Power

403
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,045
is the only real power,

404
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:39,337
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

405
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:46,920
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

406
00:26:47,587 --> 00:26:54,670
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

407
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:59,337
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

408
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:01,421
and he was deceived by someone

409
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,254
and made him buy a land and a house

410
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,586
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

411
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:09,962
And this fellow said,

412
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,795
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

413
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,878
they will not say anything to you.”

414
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:16,586
He believed him – had wrong faith,

415
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:20,587
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

416
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,462
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

417
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:33,421
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

418
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:39,920
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

419
00:27:40,337 --> 00:27:43,254
and so many people came and saw all this.

420
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,795
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

421
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:49,462
he could not understand,

422
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,462
“Why it has happened to me

423
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,837
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

424
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,504
And he was deceived and he was,

425
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,504
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

426
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,670
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

427
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:10,504
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

428
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:17,087
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

429
00:28:18,837 --> 00:28:23,129
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

430
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:26,628
That’s all – “Have faith.”

431
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:29,337
And what a miraculous thing happened,

432
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:34,462
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

433
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:39,421
And that fellow said,

434
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:42,837
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

435
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:46,254
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

436
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,504
that I want to pay.”

437
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,795
It’s something unbelievable.

438
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:02,421
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

439
00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:07,004
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

440
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:10,129
Nothing worked out, nothing

441
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,628
– only his faith.

442
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:16,753
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

443
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,712
He was supposed to go to jail,

444
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:20,379
now he’s going to become a rich man.

445
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:23,170
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

446
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,170
This is just the financial side of it,

447
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:26,379
but I know you know

448
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:28,628
that there are so many other miracles happening.

449
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:33,254
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

450
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,087
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

451
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:41,170
After realization at least you should take to faith.

452
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:44,504
That really is something surprising

453
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:46,920
that people get their realization and everything,

454
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:51,670
still they do not have faith in themselves.

455
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:57,504
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

456
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,878
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

457
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:05,920
faith was part and parcel of His being.

458
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:11,129
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

459
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:14,712
Now we have to have it.

460
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,962
We have to believe in ourselves.

461
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:21,670
There’s so many incidents I can give you

462
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:24,546
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

463
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:28,962
where just the faith has helped.

464
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:32,712
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

465
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:35,379
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

466
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:37,962
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

467
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:42,129
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

468
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:44,586
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

469
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:46,212
She said it three times.

470
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,546
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

471
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:51,170
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

472
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,254
She just got up, walked out.

473
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:56,129
And then she started running all the way,

474
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:58,504
and everybody started laughing.

475
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:00,546
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

476
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,170
I said, “But see her faith!”

477
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:09,712
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

478
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:17,045
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

479
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,753
They have shown faith in that person.

480
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,587
As I have told you always,

481
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,920
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

482
00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:28,004
One among hundred might deceive us

483
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:29,795
doesn’t matter, we trust.

484
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:33,920
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

485
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:36,129
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

486
00:31:36,586 --> 00:31:39,421
But what about deities?

487
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,753
You show faith in them and it works,

488
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,504
immediately they work out.

489
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,170
Like Guido told Me that

490
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:49,296
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

491
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:51,462
for these two days.”

492
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:55,962
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

493
00:31:57,212 --> 00:32:00,045
It disappeared.

494
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:06,045
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

495
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,878
And when we talk of faith, you know,

496
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:19,170
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

497
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:25,004
which organizes, which knows everything,

498
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,628
which is so intelligent, efficient

499
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:29,586
– above all, it loves you.

500
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:33,045
And then you show faith.

501
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:41,712
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

502
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:47,670
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

503
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:49,587
They don’t feel then bad,

504
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:52,712
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

505
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:55,587
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

506
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:59,045
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

507
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:01,962
whether this thing happens or not.

508
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:06,379
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

509
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:08,045
Supposing you are lost on the way,

510
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,712
know that it has to be that way.

511
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:16,254
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

512
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,170
He was to be crucified.

513
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,004
He had to carry the cross,

514
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:23,962
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

515
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,379
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

516
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:29,254
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

517
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,628
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

518
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,170
But this faith in Him gave Him

519
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:42,670
such a tremendous powers.

520
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:45,795
He could have done anything.

521
00:33:46,212 --> 00:33:48,296
He could have killed all these people

522
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:52,212
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

523
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:54,546
Just one glance could have killed them.

524
00:33:54,962 --> 00:33:58,004
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

525
00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,546
He went through it.

526
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:03,379
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

527
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:06,587
He is the one who won everything.

528
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,129
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

529
00:34:09,504 --> 00:34:11,337
has to look at one’s own life.

530
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:18,129
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

531
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:23,170
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

532
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,586
In the evolutionary process

533
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:29,546
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

534
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:36,379
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

535
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,421
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

536
00:34:39,837 --> 00:34:42,587
most of the people are not going to be there.

537
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:44,504
Not that we are not available,

538
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:50,586
but because they are not fated

539
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,837
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

540
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,462
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

541
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:57,379
So, you are so fortunate

542
00:34:57,753 --> 00:35:01,628
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

543
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:05,004
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

544
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:09,837
in your resurrection that is your being now.

545
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:13,379
And with that you will know how precious

546
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:16,546
you are for the whole world,

547
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,045
and that what you have to do is not

548
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:22,129
to think of material gains, physical gains

549
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:27,837
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

550
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:33,254
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

551
00:35:33,753 --> 00:35:35,795
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

552
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,421
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

553
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:39,878
everything works out,

554
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:44,045
everything in its own time shows its own results.

555
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:50,004
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

556
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:55,546
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

557
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:04,504
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

558
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,337
“All right, Mother says so.

559
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,878
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

560
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,129
Like the other day I had a journalist,

561
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,546
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

562
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
I said, “Why?”

563
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:21,587
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

564
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:23,962
How can there be a blind child,

565
00:36:24,254 --> 00:36:26,753
how can this and how can that?”

566
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:29,670
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

567
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:31,795
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

568
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:35,504
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

569
00:36:35,753 --> 00:36:40,795
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

570
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,670
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

571
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,504
So the situation is explainable;

572
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,379
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

573
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:59,837
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

574
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,129
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

575
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,546
have you any problems? None.”

576
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,587
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

577
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:15,795
Now if you say that there is a way out

578
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:19,254
and that there is a solution,

579
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,712
and that a time can come

580
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:25,962
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

581
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:29,753
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

582
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:33,254
so why not see this?

583
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:37,337
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

584
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:42,586
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

585
00:37:44,254 --> 00:37:46,421
So this kind of negative attitude

586
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,920
also Sahaja yogis can have.

587
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:51,628
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

588
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:54,586
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

589
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:58,129
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

590
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:03,129
You can cure, your faith can cure.

591
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:06,462
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

592
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:08,087
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

593
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,212
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

594
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:14,837
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

595
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:19,753
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

596
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,962
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

597
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:26,170
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

598
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,670
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

599
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:30,546
Third day he was out of hospital,

600
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:33,004
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

601
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:37,004
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

602
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:39,628
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

603
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:42,296
the deities have to work it out.

604
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,920
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

605
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:49,296
It’s the deities who stood by it.

606
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:59,712
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

607
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:06,504
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

608
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:10,753
Why not we develop that complete faith

609
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:13,129
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

610
00:39:13,546 --> 00:39:16,504
we are in the Kingdom of God,

611
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:21,254
and that this Power is going to look after us?

612
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:24,379
Then we’ll have no choices,

613
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:30,712
we’ll have no hesitation.

614
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:35,129
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

615
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:38,004
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

616
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,586
or go anywhere – so what?

617
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,254
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

618
00:39:44,628 --> 00:39:47,254
it’s perfectly all right.

619
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:50,170
And no worry of any kind.

620
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:53,129
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

621
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:55,878
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

622
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:58,004
Everything drops out.

623
00:39:58,421 --> 00:39:59,712
Doesn’t matter.

624
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:03,004
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

625
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:07,254
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

626
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:08,670
Like people tell Me,

627
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:10,379
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

628
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,504
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

629
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:16,337
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

630
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:17,920
only the seat is changed.

631
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:20,587
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

632
00:40:20,962 --> 00:40:25,712
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

633
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:33,296
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

634
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:36,379
then you don’t bother.

635
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:39,296
Many people will find out whether

636
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:42,045
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

637
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:46,962
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

638
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:51,878
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

639
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:55,920
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

640
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:59,296
Nothing can bind you,

641
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:01,504
nothing can pull you down,

642
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:05,670
no habit can come back on you;

643
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,962
because faith will purify you completely,

644
00:41:13,546 --> 00:41:16,587
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

645
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:20,878
This faith is not something

646
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:22,962
that can be put into your heads

647
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:26,962
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

648
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,504
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

649
00:41:33,212 --> 00:41:38,212
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

650
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:43,421
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

651
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:46,546
would be established,
