00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.926
Swadishthan Chakra.

00:00:03.156 --> 00:00:11.549
The quality of this Chakra is that you become creative.

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.076
Your creativity increases.

00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:21.623
People who never even wrote a line, start writing poetry.

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:23.723
People who had never given a speech

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:25.723
 started giving  long speeches

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.531
and people who had never painted,

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:30.953
never been artistic, become artistic.

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:33.233
Become very creative.

00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:37.770
We have our architects, who  have scaled great heights.

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:40.588
So creativity comes into human,

00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:46.334
and he believes that his creativeness is very important.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.725
He does not care about money,

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.725
he cares about being creative and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.409
neither do many people want to get a big name,

00:00:55.434 --> 00:01:00.249
Today  many weird things are made

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:05.711
so that we become famous, people will remember us a lot,

00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:07.697
but there is no art in that.

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:14.192
Make some big, elaborate thing and make chariots.

00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:24.243
So you receive great degree of art (creativity)

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.869
when this second Chakra of yours,

00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:30.540
the Swadishthan Chakra becomes alright.

00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:36.363
And because of this, because of Swadishthan,

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.382
what we think,

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:46.010
we use the power of the the grey cells in our brain.

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:50.596
So this Chakra supplies that required power.

00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:51.810
This Chakra.

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:56.367
So, people who think too much get all kinds of illnesses,

00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:59.050
which we call the right sided illnesses.

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:02.707
One of the illness is that the liver is spoilt

00:02:02.732 --> 00:02:07.638
and another is that he gets diabetes in his Pancreas.

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:10.960
If not that then he could get kidney trouble,

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:14.396
if not that then he could get constipation,

00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:20.341
if not that then he could get Asthma,

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:24.427
if not that then he could get a Heart Attack

00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:28.476
and he could also get Paralysis.

00:02:28.888 --> 00:02:34.150
So all right sided illnesses come from the Swadishthan Chakra

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:37.228
and also the left sided illnesses come from this Chakra.

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:41.308
So it is very important that we maintain the Swadishthan Chakra in good condition.

00:02:41.368 --> 00:02:47.044
Now how the Kundalini takes care of the Swadishthan Chakra

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.167
and gives it…..

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:50.849
that when you awaken the Kundalini of somebody

00:02:50.874 --> 00:02:54.172
and his Swadishthan Chakra is caught then in the back,

00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:56.439
where the Swadishthan Chakra is there,

00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:59.452
you will think there is heart over there.

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:03.369
When there is fast throbbing,

00:03:03.394 --> 00:03:07.458
you know that this man’s Swadishthan Chakra is caught.

00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:10.633
When is right Swadishthan is cleared,

00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:15.227
then his attention become pure

00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:20.467
and all the stress etc. which is within him nowadays is finished

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:23.006
and he becomes settled in peace.

00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:25.400
Nowadays it is very important that

00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:29.785
we keep our Swadishthan Chakra in good condition

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.182
as we are burdened

00:03:31.207 --> 00:03:34.314
with innumerable workloads nowadays.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.802
By keeping the Swadishthan Chakra clear,

00:03:36.827 --> 00:03:38.698
however much the human is troubled

00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:41.417
or he has nay problems , he sees them in a peaceful

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:43.667
and detached way

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.193
and he understands what has gone wrong.

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.500
Means that his Swadishthan Chakra gets so much spoilt nowadays

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:51.616
and so many illnesses are caused.

00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.318
Everything is there, but there is

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:58.127
some specialty of the Swadishthan Chakra that it is so bad in this Modern age.

00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:02.262
Then there are also those other diseases,

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:05.466
I don’t want to go into their details but will say this that

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:08.400
other than diseases, human being become very dissatisfied

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:10.548
and becomes very angry.

00:04:10.573 --> 00:04:11.840
Becomes right sided.

00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:14.287
 In little little thing he is short-tempered,

00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:16.780
he feels that I am a man of my such a position

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:18.534
but no one respects me.

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.344
A nobody also believes that he is important person.

00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:23.944
This happens due to the right side Swadishthan

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.017
and when the left side Swadishthan gets caught

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:30.768
then the Person becomes very worried and sad.

00:04:30.793 --> 00:04:32.872
He becomes depressed and he thinks

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.597
that there is nobody worse than me.

00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:38.814
Everybody is troubling me. I have problems.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:43.969
All kinds of Philological cases happen.

00:04:43.994 --> 00:04:50.316
So these two sides of the Chakra, the left and right,

00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:53.484
should be taken great care of

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.733
and this is very useful thing in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:57.758 --> 00:04:59.507
because both these chakras become cleared.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:02.665
When they are clear then you

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.464
understand everything as if you are watching

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:07.381
yourself from the outside.

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:10.158
Oh….so now you are getting angry….,

00:05:10.183 --> 00:05:13.048
take a seat, you laugh at yourself.

00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:14.625
Make fun of yourself.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.710
You think about yourself …..

00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:18.885
Yes what I do…. what I am doing….

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.591
so in this way human put his attention in that place

00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:25.664
and your attention becomes enlightened

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.805
and it corrects the attention.

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:33.215
Sahaja Yoga is very important  for the Swadishthan Chakra

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.838
and nowadays all the problems are due to

00:05:35.863 --> 00:05:38.703
the Swadishthan, this I ……..
