00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:19.578
Today we have decided to have Shri Krishna
Puja in the land of Shri Krishna.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:32.083
Though this is the land of Shri Krishna,

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:38.480
people ask Me why the people are not
spiritual.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:47.122
How is it they get entangled into different
types of seekings

00:00:47.323 --> 00:00:51.357
which are not leading to truth?

00:00:51.558 --> 00:01:00.223
Why is it the people in America are not
so alert as to recognize

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:05.907
what is the truth and what they have
to find?

00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:14.009
Shri Krishna’s time was, as you know,

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:21.956
at least two thousand after Shri Rama.

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:28.077
And Shri Rama created lots of disciplines

00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:37.915
for human beings to follow in the path
of their ascent.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:42.268
According to the time everything works out.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:51.229
So people were extremely rigid,
disciplined,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:05.621
and it so happened that people lost
the touch with the truth.

00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:15.374
They would leave their wives, ill-treat
their wives,

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:22.598
do all kinds of things in the name
of Shri Rama;

00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:29.847
because always human beings take
to something which is not right.

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:36.662
The another side they never saw, how
Rama went after Sitaji to find Her,

00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:48.306
and He fought the horrible rakshasa Ravana
to get back His wife.

00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:52.805
So the other side people never see.

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:56.852
Only this side they saw that He was very
strict with His wife,

00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:02.924
and if the wife stayed over in some
function, He got so angry,

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:09.146
and He shouted at Her and He threw Her out,
and all those things.

00:03:10.253 --> 00:03:19.762
That is how Shri Krishna came in.

00:03:20.494 --> 00:03:27.340
Always incarnations come one after another
to correct themselves only.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:33.854
When Shri Krishna found that it is
on the other side, of ego –

00:03:34.055 --> 00:03:36.739
that men thought they were very powerful
people

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.122
and they could do whatever they liked,

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:43.110
and they had all the power to judge their
wives –

00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:49.985
so Shri Krishna came with a new diversion,

00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:56.690
or I should say, from a new idea about
life.

00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:09.569
He talked of freedom, He talked
of abandonment,

00:04:09.824 --> 00:04:15.903
and He talked that life is for enjoyment.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:22.090
Radha was the source of joy.

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:27.008
“Ra” is energy, “dha” means the one who
sustains energy.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:30.646
She was the source of joy,

00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:40.402
and His idea was, to enjoy life is the best
way to live.

00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:46.226
And that’s why He said that you should play
Holi,

00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:50.596
you should enjoy yourselves, you must have
Raas,

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:58.629
by which you enjoy group dancing and
freedom.

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.531
So people thought that’s the way one has
to live -

00:05:04.732 --> 00:05:13.908
is to be absolutely free, live as you like,
specially in America.

00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:19.555
They thought that to enjoy life is
complete abandonment:

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:24.538
no discipline, no bindings,

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:29.684
you can divorce your wife eight times and
husbands ten times.

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:33.383
That sort of a life started long time back,

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:37.945
but it really prospered in America.

00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:43.524
The prosperity of this kind of a culture
came to such a level

00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:49.350
that now we don’t know what’s going
to happen to the family system,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.712
to the joy part of it.

00:05:56.573 --> 00:06:01.243
Again here people forgot the other side
of it.

00:06:01.722 --> 00:06:08.990
Adi Shakti first created Shri Ganesh.

00:06:09.715 --> 00:06:14.513
Shri Ganesh is the source of wisdom,

00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:19.501
He’s the source of auspiciousness.

00:06:26.893 --> 00:06:31.807
Through Him we understand auspiciousness.

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:38.260
And He is a child, He is an eternal child.

00:06:38.807 --> 00:06:49.180
And this behavior of abandonment is
very destructive,

00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:52.878
if there is no wisdom.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:01.894
First thing was to establish wisdom within
ourselves.

00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:10.069
But we start a theory or a kind of
a pattern of life

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.846
without thinking have we got the wisdom
or not?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.130
Are we capable of following that pattern
of life

00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:30.336
without any development of our wisdom?

00:07:30.537 --> 00:07:39.027
But the worst was when the freedom became
the criteria of life,

00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:46.235
people became extremely dominating and
egoistical.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.327
The first answer always you will get it,
“What’s wrong?”

00:07:54.528 --> 00:07:59.297
You ask them, “Why are you doing this?”
“What’s wrong?”

00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:03.412
“I mean, it’s wrong because it is not
auspicious.”

00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:13.055
“What’s auspiciousness is there?” –
absolutely like you can call them,

00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:20.800
people without any brains, brainless
people.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:24.677
“Brainless” means there is no wisdom.

00:08:24.878 --> 00:08:30.948
What is the power of brain is wisdom.

00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:51.793
So life started drifting into a destructive
pond, we should say, of no return.

00:08:52.065 --> 00:09:01.043
And every kind of filth was accepted
as a blessing,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:08.453
and nobody would think that this is wrong,

00:09:08.654 --> 00:09:13.004
this is not for human life.

00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:17.299
Even the animals are all not like that.

00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:29.843
Added to that came the stupidity
of drinking alcohol.

00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:39.812
I don’t know how they discovered alcohol
long time back, long, long time back,

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:44.754
but they say it came out of the manthana

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:49.108
and out of the churning of the ocean

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:57.441
by the suras and asuras, by the rakshasas
and by the devas.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:03.011
Must be some trick to get these rakshasas
drunk,

00:10:03.212 --> 00:10:20.850
and to somehow or other manage to get the
kumbha of, the pitcher of amruta, ambrosia;

00:10:21.128 --> 00:10:25.265
so that these rakshasas will be lost
drinking

00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:32.812
and then the devas will get their due,

00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:38.069
which was amruta, which was ambrosia.

00:10:38.278 --> 00:10:47.082
That might be one of the reasons that
it was created out of the ocean,

00:10:47.283 --> 00:10:53.026
or among all the fourteen things that came
out of the ocean.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:08.092
So kind of a oppositions, opposite quality
of things were created.

00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:13.461
Another thing they created were
prostitutes.

00:11:14.304 --> 00:11:20.548
One may ask why prostitutes came out
of that manthana –

00:11:21.295 --> 00:11:25.551
because now you have freedom.

00:11:26.544 --> 00:11:30.509
You are given freedom to choose,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:38.834
and so you must have full vision

00:11:39.035 --> 00:11:48.770
whether to choose an auspicious life,
a holy life, a divine life,

00:11:48.971 --> 00:11:53.491
or to choose destructive life.

00:11:53.744 --> 00:11:56.683
This opposition came forward

00:11:56.884 --> 00:12:02.274
because your freedom had to be respected,

00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:04.605
that was very important.

00:12:04.806 --> 00:12:09.757
In the growth of human awareness it was
very important

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.701
to respect the freedom of human beings.

00:12:13.902 --> 00:12:19.993
Because animals, if you see, they have
no freedom:

00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:26.357
a snake will be a snake, scorpion will be
a scorpion,

00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:29.369
lion will be a lion.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:36.360
They live with their own qualities, gunas;

00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:43.407
you cannot make them do something that
other animals are doing.

00:12:43.909 --> 00:12:49.731
We have passed through all these different
animal yonis

00:12:49.932 --> 00:12:55.436
and now we are human beings, and now we
have freedom.

00:12:55.637 --> 00:12:59.304
Now why freedom, one may ask – because
these days they ask

00:12:59.505 --> 00:13:05.088
such questions for everything you say –
why freedom needed?

00:13:05.289 --> 00:13:10.793
Like I always told you before that
in the school they teach you

00:13:10.994 --> 00:13:16.517
two plus two is four, and you have
to remember it.

00:13:18.773 --> 00:13:22.177
But when you grow and when you go
to college,

00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:28.457
you are supposed to have freedom
to understand everything yourself.

00:13:31.882 --> 00:13:39.618
In the same manner, your awareness was
to be brought to that level

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:46.365
that you could use your freedom wisely.

00:13:49.433 --> 00:13:52.512
Now, you have to have temptations.

00:13:52.713 --> 00:13:59.709
How can you judge a person whether he is
blind or not blind?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:07.370
Supposing you ask a blind person, “Is this
a flower?”

00:14:07.703 --> 00:14:12.010
He might feel it, say, “No, no, it’s
a bee.”

00:14:12.973 --> 00:14:17.284
So he has to have his eyes to see,

00:14:17.485 --> 00:14:23.785
and once you give him the eyes he goes
amok.

00:14:24.024 --> 00:14:29.582
He doesn’t know what to do, what is good
for him.

00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:37.942
So he chose all that was not at all good
for him,

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:44.790
auspicious for him, and detrimental for his
growth.

00:14:45.842 --> 00:14:49.867
So the drinking started, and with drinking

00:14:50.068 --> 00:14:55.649
you don’t know how we get abandoned.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:03.244
I have heard people, that they lose their
sense of relationship with brothers,

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:08.711
sisters, mothers, everything, if you get
drunk.

00:15:08.912 --> 00:15:12.096
So many drunkards have told Me this.

00:15:12.297 --> 00:15:16.427
That is why in this country we have funny
type of relationships –

00:15:16.628 --> 00:15:21.900
one can’t understand, how can it be?
But it is so.

00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:25.174
By drinking, all these things have happened

00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:27.744
that they don’t know who is your sister,

00:15:27.945 --> 00:15:31.817
who is your wife, who is your mother.

00:15:35.722 --> 00:15:39.521
In India also we have but different type
of thing,

00:15:39.722 --> 00:15:43.438
that they will ill-treat their mother,
they’ll ill-treat their sister,

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:47.807
ill-treat their wives; the other way round
also.

00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:52.729
But here they do not ill-treat,

00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:59.625
they love, but in a very perverted manner.

00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:04.391
You see the reaction in two countries.

00:16:04.592 --> 00:16:08.377
So this grew up very much,

00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:18.057
and today we see a country that is America
in a complete chaos.

00:16:28.724 --> 00:16:35.131
So this freedom without any wisdom at all
growing,

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:43.632
starts creating a terrible ego.

00:16:44.372 --> 00:16:52.956
When auspiciousness is given up then
Shri Ganesha sleeps

00:16:53.157 --> 00:17:02.651
and as Christ, who is the incarnation
of Shri Ganesha, also doesn’t bother.

00:17:03.415 --> 00:17:07.735
So the rule of Christ is finished.

00:17:07.936 --> 00:17:16.688
So what rules is the ego, this ego which
thinks it is free.

00:17:16.889 --> 00:17:26.963
It doesn’t know it is bound by all kinds
of enemies of very horrible types.

00:17:27.823 --> 00:17:30.320
At the time of Shri Krishna He said

00:17:30.521 --> 00:17:35.805
that the worst enemy human beings have is
anger,

00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:39.730
but I think in modern times the worst enemy

00:17:39.931 --> 00:17:46.293
human beings have is greed and jealousy.

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:51.589
Greed has no meaning these days. I mean,
what do you say to a person

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:58.811
who has three thousand shoes – I mean,
pairs of shoes?

00:17:59.012 --> 00:18:01.952
Must be mad!

00:18:02.732 --> 00:18:06.956
There are all sorts of things, you know,
in greed you see these days.

00:18:07.157 --> 00:18:12.876
You don’t know how people are really
behaving.

00:18:13.077 --> 00:18:15.259
No one can explain.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:22.563
I know of someone who has five thousand
dogs.

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:29.369
What is she doing with those dogs I don’t
know, but she has.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:42.408
Like all countries, even in America
I think it’s much worse, much worse.

00:18:43.061 --> 00:18:47.548
Now you may call it anything, consumerism
or anything like that,

00:18:47.749 --> 00:18:51.313
or your economics which is, I think, very
faulty,

00:18:51.514 --> 00:18:56.466
it doesn’t understand human beings –
whatever it may be,

00:18:56.667 --> 00:18:59.932
it can never bring benevolence,

00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:05.565
neither to the person who thinks he is
rich,

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:13.283
or to the people whom he is exploiting.

00:19:15.357 --> 00:19:18.912
As far as spirituality is concerned,

00:19:19.113 --> 00:19:25.833
they are all away from the realm
of divinity.

00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:29.154
Now the mind starts working with ego.

00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:33.102
Ego takes over like a computer,

00:19:33.303 --> 00:19:36.240
and it starts suggesting ways and methods

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:41.738
by which how much money you can earn.

00:19:41.939 --> 00:19:45.338
So when you start earning money,

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:50.390
then again the same Ego Mister tells you

00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:55.190
how to destroy yourself with this money.

00:19:56.193 --> 00:19:59.678
They do all kinds of things when they have
money.

00:19:59.879 --> 00:20:04.286
I mean, that money is not a Lakshmi prasad;

00:20:04.487 --> 00:20:08.182
it is some sort of a money that becomes
like a rakshasa

00:20:08.383 --> 00:20:12.286
or a devil and which devours you.

00:20:12.487 --> 00:20:17.561
It takes you to all kinds of wrong places.

00:20:17.762 --> 00:20:23.920
It takes you to such horrible theories

00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:29.233
that nobody would accept such theories.

00:20:29.434 --> 00:20:35.184
This ego makes you feel that – ah, yes,
you are perfect,

00:20:35.385 --> 00:20:40.777
you know everything, whatever you are doing
is the best.

00:20:40.978 --> 00:20:45.171
But with all that doing, what happens?

00:20:45.372 --> 00:20:50.360
You become restless, you cannot sleep.

00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:58.623
Now with the problem here is that people
have this so-called tension, stress.

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:02.821
In our young age we never heard of
this word, what is tension, stress is.

00:21:03.021 --> 00:21:07.181
Even now in India very few people know
about it.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.277
Because you yourself, you are destroying
yourself.

00:21:12.478 --> 00:21:17.070
So with this money, say, you want to entice
some woman –

00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:19.716
take a very low-level thing.

00:21:19.917 --> 00:21:23.484
Then you’ll run after her, give her this,
give her that,

00:21:23.685 --> 00:21:28.480
and spend all your money till you become
bankrupt.

00:21:29.317 --> 00:21:33.539
And then you’ll start sitting and crying.

00:21:34.607 --> 00:21:36.583
And this is a common story.

00:21:36.784 --> 00:21:39.951
I don’t know why don’t they make films
like this,

00:21:40.152 --> 00:21:44.941
to show actually what happens to a person
who runs after money,

00:21:45.142 --> 00:21:47.371
and he goes on then spending that money.

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:52.972
He doesn’t know what to do, you see; money
also eats him, I think.

00:21:53.173 --> 00:21:59.394
On the other side we have people who are
extremely miserly.

00:22:03.137 --> 00:22:09.069
So all their – with the money only, they
become so much greedy

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:13.732
that they keep their money in seven locks
and keys.

00:22:13.933 --> 00:22:19.905
Now, they see in the world there are people
who are suffering so much,

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:23.204
who have so much problem.

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:28.702
Why not spend some money on them?

00:22:29.162 --> 00:22:36.585
So then there are agents come up, like
our Swiss bank.

00:22:37.188 --> 00:22:46.041
Swiss bank is the outcome of our greed,
completely our greed;

00:22:46.242 --> 00:22:48.991
because we have so much money we don’t
know what to do,

00:22:49.192 --> 00:22:51.946
so we put it in the Swiss bank.

00:22:52.147 --> 00:22:55.753
Swiss bank says, “All right, we’ll look
after it.”

00:22:55.954 --> 00:23:00.504
Because we are greedy as well as we are
miserly.

00:23:00.705 --> 00:23:06.088
I mean, miserly people are another
crackpots, I should say, the way they live.

00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:10.888
But also the people who have money are
really crackpots.

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:18.857
They have no sense of self-respect, neither
self-esteem.

00:23:19.058 --> 00:23:26.713
Now imagine eighty, ninety-year-old women
going for a shake dance, as I told you.

00:23:26.914 --> 00:23:30.583
Because they have money they think they
should do this,

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:33.674
competing with the young people, because
they have money.

00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:41.285
If they have money, if they get it without
any, I should say,

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:46.753
cheating or without deceiving someone,
if it’s a real good money

00:23:46.954 --> 00:23:55.245
they should give it to some good cause
and try to propagate goodness.

00:23:55.446 --> 00:24:00.671
But money itself seems to be something
very bad, like poison,

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:09.434
because either this money makes you mad
how to spend it,

00:24:09.635 --> 00:24:13.488
or mad how to save it.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.548
As if you become a slave of this money
business,

00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:24.906
and in that slavishness you go on drifting,
drifting, drifting.

00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:33.365
I’ve seen people when they talk,

00:24:33.566 --> 00:24:36.408
you don’t know why they talk like that,
you know.

00:24:36.609 --> 00:24:39.178
Then you discover that they have a bank
account,

00:24:39.379 --> 00:24:42.472
that’s why they are talking like that.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:48.589
If you don’t have bank account then you
won’t talk like that.

00:24:49.456 --> 00:24:51.765
I mean, more than that also.

00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:56.524
This country is overflowing with money,

00:24:56.725 --> 00:25:00.694
with all kinds of money transactions,

00:25:00.895 --> 00:25:03.536
permutations and combinations and this
and that,

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:10.840
and what you can do with money – because
Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:17.355
He is the Deity, or we can say He is
the God of wealth.

00:25:17.556 --> 00:25:24.929
But at the same time, He is a very
mischievous God.

00:25:25.365 --> 00:25:30.363
You can see clearly: this is supposed to be
Shri Krishna’s country

00:25:30.564 --> 00:25:34.183
which is overflowing with money.

00:25:34.384 --> 00:25:38.831
At the same time you find horrible things
happening,

00:25:39.032 --> 00:25:40.777
worst in the whole world.

00:25:40.978 --> 00:25:43.994
I mean, no one can beat Americans, they
say,

00:25:44.195 --> 00:25:58.514
in stupidity, in vulgarity, indecency,
exploitation.

00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:08.074
So this is the curse of money on human
beings, which is to be understood,

00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:17.230
that freedom without wisdom is the most
dangerous thing to use.

00:26:17.873 --> 00:26:23.052
It is better not to be free if you have
no wisdom,

00:26:23.253 --> 00:26:26.579
because God knows what you will do

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.202
if you have freedom and no wisdom.

00:26:30.403 --> 00:26:37.869
I’ve seen here, heard about women who are
killing their children.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:44.082
I mean, nowhere you will find such a thing
like that, killing small children.

00:26:44.283 --> 00:26:50.163
Now how this money makes you so dry

00:26:50.364 --> 00:27:02.921
that you have no, I would say, no love,
no feeling.

00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:08.237
Just for killing’s sake also, people kill
here.

00:27:15.006 --> 00:27:19.714
Now there are – there’s another thing that
this money does:

00:27:19.915 --> 00:27:24.341
it creates a disparity.

00:27:24.777 --> 00:27:31.389
There are some who are very rich,
there are some who are very poor.

00:27:31.706 --> 00:27:39.498
So those who are very poor are against
those who are very rich.

00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:45.351
They can’t understand why should these
people have so much money,

00:27:45.552 --> 00:27:48.127
so they think it’s a matter of right

00:27:48.328 --> 00:27:53.596
to snatch all that money from them and use
it for themselves.

00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:58.115
But the same money can destroy them also.

00:27:59.499 --> 00:28:05.446
So snatching that money with violence or
grabbing it

00:28:05.647 --> 00:28:10.159
is not going to give you any blessings.

00:28:13.568 --> 00:28:18.741
So what is the purpose of wealth?

00:28:19.011 --> 00:28:26.030
That is very important for people who
worship Shri Krishna to know.

00:28:26.231 --> 00:28:32.650
In Shri Krishna’s life, He saw that
the women

00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:39.134
who were creating buttermilk and butter

00:28:39.335 --> 00:28:44.989
were carrying all that all the way
to Mathura,

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:50.192
where in Mathura this horrible King Kamsa
was reigning.

00:28:50.393 --> 00:28:55.748
And they used to give to all the soldiers
there.

00:28:55.981 --> 00:28:59.122
He didn’t want them to do that.

00:28:59.323 --> 00:29:01.642
Because they would fetch much more money,

00:29:01.843 --> 00:29:09.372
they would be paid much more, so these
women were greedy about it.

00:29:09.573 --> 00:29:14.257
Instead of giving them to their own
children, to their own families,

00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:20.468
they used to collect all that and take
to Mathura.

00:29:20.813 --> 00:29:28.851
From very childhood Shri Krishna used
to throw stones at those pitchers

00:29:29.052 --> 00:29:34.366
and break their pitchers, because he didn’t
want

00:29:34.567 --> 00:29:44.395
that to go all the way to Mathura to feed
those horrible soldiers.

00:29:45.754 --> 00:29:49.739
This is what it is we have to learn,

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:56.707
that if we have, say, surplus money or
something,

00:29:56.908 --> 00:29:59.767
you have to think what you can do with it

00:29:59.968 --> 00:30:12.636
and what joy it can bring, by sharing with
right type of people.

00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:17.121
Not in the pubs, no, no, I don’t mean that,

00:30:17.322 --> 00:30:24.537
but sharing it for their needs and what
they want.

00:30:24.738 --> 00:30:32.382
Actually a disciple of Shri Krishna should
be a self-satisfied person.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:39.524
Look at His life, how self-satisfied He
was.

00:30:39.786 --> 00:30:51.926
Every episode about Him talks of His
complete oneness with Himself.

00:30:53.865 --> 00:30:58.088
For example, when Arjuna asked Him that

00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:02.919
“Why don’t You join us Pandavas to fight
with us?”

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:10.171
In modern times in the competitive life,
you see, if you see those races,

00:31:10.372 --> 00:31:15.664
they’re so anxious to win, to have
the higher position.

00:31:15.865 --> 00:31:22.980
Then all the big, big politicians are
trying

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:29.877
to bring down other politicians, to have
their own power.

00:31:30.078 --> 00:31:36.399
But what did Shri Krishna say, that “I will
be your charioteer.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:45.339
I’ll drive your chariot, but I will not
lift My weapon against anyone.”

00:31:45.824 --> 00:31:50.178
We can’t think of anyone like that today.

00:31:50.622 --> 00:31:54.341
See, people will never say that,
“All right,

00:31:54.542 --> 00:32:00.536
I will stay down and you’ll be
on the throne.”

00:32:00.737 --> 00:32:04.119
Very difficult even to see one person

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.606
who could behave like Shri Krishna.

00:32:07.807 --> 00:32:17.148
Because whether He is a charioteer or He
is the one who was Arjuna,

00:32:17.349 --> 00:32:26.220
or He was the captain of the whole thing,
He knew what He was.

00:32:26.421 --> 00:32:31.918
What was the need for Him to become this
or that, and that?

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:37.526
But these days, you see, to become
something is such a struggle going on.

00:32:37.727 --> 00:32:41.842
Someone wants to be, say, the prime
minister –

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.638
that’s the highest, I think, I don’t know.

00:32:44.839 --> 00:32:50.168
But then some want to dislodge the prime
minister.

00:32:50.369 --> 00:32:52.698
Then you start from the peon upward,

00:32:52.899 --> 00:32:57.366
everybody wants something higher, higher,
higher, higher.

00:32:57.567 --> 00:33:01.695
This is another very subtle type of greed

00:33:01.896 --> 00:33:08.394
which is working out in our minds.

00:33:08.595 --> 00:33:14.495
Even in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen that
the leaders –

00:33:14.696 --> 00:33:17.292
now are settled down of course, much
better –

00:33:17.493 --> 00:33:22.258
but used to be such a terrible fight
for leadership.

00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:27.136
It’s all a myth, actual myth, but they used
to fight.

00:33:27.337 --> 00:33:31.481
And they would write letters after letters.
There were groups:

00:33:31.682 --> 00:33:34.957
one group would write against another
group,

00:33:35.157 --> 00:33:37.309
another group would write against this
group,

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:46.537
and I used to just laugh, because there’s
no truth in it.

00:33:46.738 --> 00:33:50.167
Leadership is no truth, it’s just a joke.

00:33:50.368 --> 00:33:54.071
But even if I told them it’s a joke, they
would not understand

00:33:54.272 --> 00:33:59.967
it’s a joke and not to be that serious,
and to fight about it.

00:34:01.866 --> 00:34:06.698
Gradually it’s settled down normally –
better, much better, it’s not so much bad.

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:11.028
But that is what is there, this greed.

00:34:11.229 --> 00:34:14.143
That was the mistake, I think, of Shri
Krishna,

00:34:14.344 --> 00:34:20.524
that instead of anger He should have put
greed as the worst thing.

00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:26.362
Actually, you see, these incarnations don’t
know much about human beings,

00:34:26.563 --> 00:34:28.890
and they would not know how far they will
be going –

00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:30.961
same happens to Me.

00:34:31.162 --> 00:34:37.096
But they are absolutely unaware that
what these human beings are,

00:34:37.297 --> 00:34:44.281
what you tell them, what they will make
out of it.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.678
Their brains are so sharp

00:34:48.878 --> 00:34:52.532
that they’ll pick up whatever is wrong
for them,

00:34:52.733 --> 00:34:57.691
and never see whatever is right for them.

00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:02.830
Shri Rama tried something – it was of no
use.

00:35:03.031 --> 00:35:06.865
Shri Krishna tried something – it was of no
use.

00:35:07.066 --> 00:35:11.816
So we come to Shri Jesus Christ.

00:35:12.017 --> 00:35:19.961
Nowadays the people who are something
else are ardent disciples of Christ.

00:35:26.248 --> 00:35:30.829
They have no wisdom of any kind.

00:35:33.143 --> 00:35:37.280
Like mad they are going about.

00:35:37.481 --> 00:35:39.587
You read there about their organizations,

00:35:39.788 --> 00:35:43.412
you read about things that they do,
you are amazed at it;

00:35:43.613 --> 00:35:48.389
you see, how can they be disciples
of Christ?

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:55.790
In no way they have any right on Christ
to begin with,

00:35:55.991 --> 00:36:01.280
because they don’t know anything about
Christ.

00:36:01.481 --> 00:36:06.032
First to know and then to imbibe His
qualities

00:36:06.233 --> 00:36:15.559
are something very, very, I should say,
impossible thing it is these days.

00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:20.768
Some would say, “Why was He born in
a poor family?

00:36:20.969 --> 00:36:26.163
He was born in a poor family – He should
have been born to Mr. Ford.”

00:36:26.364 --> 00:36:31.121
Some say – I mean, you see, finding faults
and criticizing

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:35.308
is the only thing left to us now

00:36:35.509 --> 00:36:39.606
because you can’t do anything else, that’s
why.

00:36:39.807 --> 00:36:44.452
Then they would say, “Why did He get
himself crucified?”

00:36:44.653 --> 00:36:47.331
He didn’t crucify you. He should have
crucified you,

00:36:47.532 --> 00:36:52.716
but actually He crucified himself, that was
His mistake.

00:36:53.799 --> 00:37:01.477
It is also very difficult for human beings
to understand incarnations,

00:37:01.678 --> 00:37:05.140
because they are in juxtaposition.

00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:12.030
They are very different things, so human
beings can’t understand.

00:37:12.334 --> 00:37:15.715
Now they are there to lead them,

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:19.673
they are there to tell them what is to be
done;

00:37:19.874 --> 00:37:27.595
but the way they understand, you see, it’s
just absurd.

00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:36.119
For example, you know in Chicago I met
the head of the Hare Rama fellow.

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:40.527
Another puzzle he was to Me, really,

00:37:40.728 --> 00:37:43.573
because he came in a very thin dhoti

00:37:43.774 --> 00:37:48.388
and it was so very cold, and he was
shivering before Me.

00:37:48.888 --> 00:37:52.731
So I said, “Sir, why are you wearing such
a thin dhoti?

00:37:52.932 --> 00:37:55.853
You are shivering, I am very sorry.”

00:37:56.054 --> 00:38:01.685
He said, “Why? My guru has told me
that I should have a thin dhoti.”

00:38:01.886 --> 00:38:06.166
“Why?” “To go to heaven, to achieve my
ascent.”

00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:08.447
I said, “Really? He told you like that?

00:38:08.648 --> 00:38:12.268
But Shri Krishna never wore a thin dhoti.”

00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:14.178
“But I am not Shri Krishna,” he said –

00:38:14.379 --> 00:38:20.499
see how the human mind tries to avoid.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:31.241
So now, then he had shaved his head and
had a big pony-tail behind.

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:34.292
I asked him, “Why have you shaved your
head?”

00:38:34.493 --> 00:38:38.072
So he said, “Because my guru told me that
you have to shave your head

00:38:38.273 --> 00:38:41.234
if you have to go to heaven.”

00:38:41.435 --> 00:38:45.279
So I said, “But Shri Krishna did not shave
His head.”

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.440
“No, no, but He was incarnation. I have
to shave my head

00:38:49.641 --> 00:38:52.984
so I have to go to heaven.”

00:38:53.185 --> 00:38:59.454
So I told him, “See, Kabira has said that,

00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:09.895
‘These sheep are shaven and shorn every
year twice.

00:39:11.313 --> 00:39:17.598
And if they all go to heaven where will be
a place left for you?’ ”

00:39:17.799 --> 00:39:20.419
So he never understood Me. He got very
angry with Me,

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.939
and he said to Me, “Mother, You are talking
ill about my guru.”

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:29.300
I said, “I am not talking ill. I am your
Mother, I am just asking Me

00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:33.218
that what’s the use of wearing this thin
dhoti, that’s all.

00:39:33.419 --> 00:39:38.510
A Mother has a right to ask.” He got very
angry, he went away.

00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:43.620
And he’s the head of these Hare Ramas!

00:39:48.858 --> 00:39:55.152
So to understand the incarnation also
you have to be a realized soul,

00:39:55.353 --> 00:40:02.560
otherwise you cannot, because they look
very absurd.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:10.457
Without asking any questions if you can
become a realized soul –

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:15.144
if you ask questions it’s one degree less –

00:40:15.345 --> 00:40:22.810
without questioning if you get your
realization, without any questions,

00:40:23.011 --> 00:40:26.179
then you have the highest marks.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.963
But if you, after questioning and this
thing and that thing,

00:40:31.164 --> 00:40:36.984
then you have less marks, because your
mind is very active,

00:40:37.185 --> 00:40:41.330
and the person whose mind is active

00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:46.772
cannot achieve something beyond the mind.

00:40:46.973 --> 00:40:50.061
You have to achieve it beyond the mind.

00:40:50.262 --> 00:40:55.141
This is one thing at least if you all
understand,

00:40:55.342 --> 00:40:59.454
I think My work is done.

00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:03.400
All tricks tried by Shri Krishna,

00:41:03.601 --> 00:41:06.786
all disciplines put by Shri Rama,

00:41:06.987 --> 00:41:11.569
all the gurus who tried their level best
to tell you what to do,

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:23.748
is only to make you a yogi by taking you
beyond the mind.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.303
And then what happens?

00:41:29.504 --> 00:41:34.854
Then you are in connection with this
all-pervading Power

00:41:35.055 --> 00:41:38.597
which is looking after you, which protects
you, which helps you;

00:41:38.798 --> 00:41:50.454
in every way you are absolutely in charge
of this Paramachaitanya.

00:41:51.493 --> 00:41:54.893
Now supposing I do not take the citizenship
of America –

00:41:55.094 --> 00:41:59.007
of course I may never take, but supposing.

00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:04.189
Then this government is not in charge
of Me.

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:12.022
But if I take, of course they’ll tax Me, do
all kinds of things, doesn’t matter,

00:42:12.223 --> 00:42:16.347
but at least they’ll be in charge.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:20.050
But this Paramchaitanya when it takes
over,

00:42:20.251 --> 00:42:26.925
it is love, is absolute love:

00:42:27.126 --> 00:42:35.452
love which thinks, understands,
coordinates, cooperates, works,

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:40.539
and extremely sensitive.

00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:49.755
It works – I’m sometimes so surprised
the way it works,

00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:57.216
without fail, without making any mistakes.

00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:03.373
You don’t have to even tell, because you
are there.

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:10.570
But to believe that we are there also
is a difficult task.

00:43:12.279 --> 00:43:19.753
With all the experiences you should believe
that you are there,

00:43:19.954 --> 00:43:23.615
but that is also quite a difficult task.

00:43:23.816 --> 00:43:27.757
So when we say they’re established Sahaja
yogis

00:43:27.958 --> 00:43:35.256
then what we mean is this, that they are
completely one,

00:43:35.486 --> 00:43:43.368
under complete charge of Paramachaitanya.

00:43:43.983 --> 00:43:47.269
That’s what we have to be.

00:43:47.914 --> 00:43:53.082
If you want to save this country, you have
to be that.

00:43:53.283 --> 00:43:56.403
No argument, no explanation, nothing;

00:43:56.604 --> 00:44:01.368
no fighting, no strikes, nothing.

00:44:01.569 --> 00:44:05.214
No placards is needed.

00:44:05.415 --> 00:44:11.278
You are the ones who will advertise Sahaja
Yoga.

00:44:12.254 --> 00:44:16.619
Every one of you should understand

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:23.011
that your life is very important at this
juncture.

00:44:24.515 --> 00:44:30.121
And you have to become that special person

00:44:30.322 --> 00:44:37.540
who reflects reality through the divine
love.

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:40.373
May God bless you.
