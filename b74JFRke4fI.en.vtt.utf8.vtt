00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:07.238
06.10.1983 Shri Ganesha Puja
Vancouver (Canada)

00:00:16.553 --> 00:00:19.459
Now raise your Kundalini.

00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:22.890
All of you raise your Kundalini and tie it up so that

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.684
 it's up there.  Just raise it like that.

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:32.141
No. This way. This way you should do it. This way.

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:12.425
In the West, you have grown very big outside,

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:14.885
like a tree has grown very big.

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:19.541
But it must find its roots, otherwise the whole tree can fall off,

00:01:19.723 --> 00:01:24.475
without nutrition. So you must know the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:28.130
Without the knowledge of the roots, the tree has no meaning.

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:34.135
 So this may be a little new thing for you to understand,

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.838
but you must know ... to know the knowledge of the roots

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.719
 you have to become subtle.

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:42.629
If you are not a subtle personality you cannot enter into your roots

00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:46.899
and you cannot understand what lies in there.

00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:49.924
So, first of all, I said yesterday,

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:54.138
you all should get your Realisation, and after your Realisation

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.550
 you can understand this better than anything else.

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:00.815
Christ came on this earth,

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:04.231
 but he was only allowed to preach and talk

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:06.972
 for three and a half years of his life time.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.154
And in tree and a half years is nothing.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.373
In that, whatever was possible he said positively,

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:16.783
 he told about the future,  all that was to happen.

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:19.628
 He didn't talk much about the Holy Ghost.

00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:23.718
The reason was His Mother was the Holy Ghost at that time

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:25.960
 and He didn't want to talk about Her

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.790
because the attention of the people

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.750
would be on Her and they would have killed Her.

00:02:32.813 --> 00:02:36.323
And then he has got eleven destroying powers.

00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:40.118
 And he would have used those eleven destroying powers

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:43.171
and everything would have been finished,

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:45.385
 the whole drama would have been finished.

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:49.373
So He did not mention much about the Holy Ghost and did not exaplain.

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:54.084
But logically we must understand that we talk of the Father

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:57.335
 and of the Son but not of the Mother.

00:02:57.462 --> 00:03:00.862
How can you have a father and a son and no mother?

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:05.302
 That's an impossibility. So, Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother.

00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:07.712
In the sanskrit language if you go -

00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:10.953
 because in the Bible you cannot find everything about Christ,

00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:12.463
 it's very little.

00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:16.463
But you have to go back about 1400 years back that in India,

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:20.461
people have prophesied about Him, how He will be coming.

00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:22.745
 And about the Primordial Mother

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:25.927
who was called as Adi Shakti  who was the Holy Ghost.

00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:29.475
All description was given  and when Her advent will come

00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:32.084
 what will happen and how to recognize her.

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:36.710
All this is described very well so many years back,

00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:39.771
even about Christ, quite a lot to described

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.820
 and also we are going to read it out to you,

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.820
 the translation of what is written about Christ

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:51.605
and then there is a complete description about His origin,

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:55.155
 how He came on this earth and what was the purpose of His life.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.517
Ask that gentlemen to come inside. Can you ?

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.288
This gentlemen, come inside. You sit comfortably.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.273
And what was the purpose of His life

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:09.003
and how He has to establish in this centre here

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:12.954
and that by establishing there he can suck

00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.681
the ego and superego in you and how He takes you away,

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:22.057
 or He washes off your karmas and your conditionings.

00:04:22.224 --> 00:04:26.269
All that has been described very well in the Devi Mahatmya book

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.340
 out of which we are just going to read a little bit to you

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:30.821
about the adoration.

00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:34.485
So Bible cannot contain Christ, because Christ is Chaitanya,

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:37.996
 He is Omkara, He is the Logos as we call Him.

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.374
 He is the Power, and you cannot describe Him in one little book,

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:45.755
when He was here only for three and a half years  and

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:49.057
the people who saw him also were his disciples,

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.681
they did not know much about Him.

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:54.174
 Until he was resurrected they did not believe Him

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.787
 and even after His death, I mean His resurrection,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.825
Matthew and all these people were quite disturbed and upset

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:04.025
 because you know they were all persecuted

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.893
and they, somehow or the other, wanted to continue

00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:10.364
 the message of Christ in a very secretive manner.

00:05:11.573 --> 00:05:14.680
So today the time has come for you to know about Him,

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.675
about what He was -  in the Heaven

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.741
 and how He came on this Earth.

00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:25.084
 All that we don't have time today but we'll be just telling you

00:05:25.493 --> 00:05:28.598
 about a little passage that is written about him.

00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:31.745
So first, He is the one who is innocence,

00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:33.769
 who is an eternal child,

00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:38.574
and He appears first on the first chakra of Muladhara,

00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:40.817
 and there He's called as Shri Ganesh.

00:05:40.952 --> 00:05:43.464
Where the carbon atom was made. Carbon.

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.083
And that is very important to understand that Ganesha

00:05:47.324 --> 00:05:50.316
 is the symbol of innocence

00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:57.557
and Mother Earth is the power of that deity, Ganesha.

00:05:57.922 --> 00:06:02.627
So it was Ganesha, later on incarnated on this Earth  as Christ,

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:07.161
 and He will be incarnated again as eleven Rudras,

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.888
 means Ekadashas, or we can call him as Nishkalanka deity,

00:06:11.507 --> 00:06:14.543
when He will just sort out things in a sense that

00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:18.889
He will just cut the people out who are not realised,

00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:22.632
 who are no good, and the rest of them

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.223
will ascend in the Kingdom of Heaven,

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:27.220
 this is what is the last Ascent.

00:06:27.648 --> 00:06:29.934
Now, for this ... Please sit down, please.

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:32.264
 Please be seated, give him a chair ...

00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:34.421
 You have to sit down comfortably. You see,

00:06:34.573 --> 00:06:37.736
It is a thing that makes... happen something within you,

00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:40.691
so you have to be very much restful, that's very important.

00:06:40.762 --> 00:06:44.256
Give him a chair if he cannot sit on the ground.

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:48.711
Give him a chair, but be comfortable otherwise it won't work out, you see,

00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:51.503
 it is not something that will go into your mind,

00:06:51.584 --> 00:06:53.702
 it's something that will go to your being, so

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:55.237
you have to be very receptive.

00:06:55.412 --> 00:06:57.478
Another thing I'll tell you, yesterday also

00:06:57.573 --> 00:07:01.474
I saw, and today also, you should not move your neck

00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:03.937
by eating something or chewing something

00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:06.741
because this Vishuddhi chakra gets upset at that time.

00:07:06.821 --> 00:07:09.455
So keep still, unless and until you are still

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.922
 it cannot work out. So please keep still.

00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:16.100
So this is the nourishment of the roots

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.031
of which we are going to work out, which you will feel it,

00:07:19.242 --> 00:07:22.301
very nicely within yourself.
