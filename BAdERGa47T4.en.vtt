00:03.693 --> 00:10.423
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:10.503 --> 00:23.694
When we are seeking the Truth we have to know
we have to be honest about it.

00:24.254 --> 00:28.813
Because it is benevolent for us, not for others.

00:28.893 --> 00:34.693
We are seeking the Truth for ourselves, not
for others.

00:35.540 --> 00:44.800
The another thing we have to remember, very
humbly, that truth is what it is.

00:45.581 --> 00:51.626
We can not change it, we can not organize
it, we can not maneuver it.

00:51.706 --> 00:56.836
It is what has been and will be.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.928
And what is the Truth?

01:01.256 --> 01:06.665
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

01:06.745 --> 01:18.116
You are not this body, you are not this mind, you
are not this ego, and you are not this conditioning.

01:18.196 --> 01:20.917
You are the Spirit.

01:20.997 --> 01:26.588
But so far you have been a human being.

01:26.668 --> 01:35.928
But to be humane being itself is a very great thing.

01:36.419 --> 01:40.036
Is the greatest thing – to be a humane being.

01:40.116 --> 01:48.524
Perhaps we have not realized the value of
our life because we do not know what we are.

01:48.604 --> 02:00.946
The way we waste our time, waste our energies,
waste our attention on things, which are senseless,

02:01.026 --> 02:09.776
because we still have to understand the greatness
of our being.

02:10.466 --> 02:23.782
Human beings are made with such care, so
beautifully, such delicate working of the Divine

02:23.863 --> 02:28.464
from amoeba to this stage passing through
various stages,

02:28.544 --> 02:33.226
such a beautiful thing has
been created as a human being.

02:33.306 --> 02:40.836
But first we must have this attention to
our Self that there must be something.

02:40.916 --> 02:48.576
It can not be a purposelessly [WAY or DOING],
it can not be something just a chance.

02:48.656 --> 02:51.897
Is a wrong idea to play with.

02:51.977 --> 03:05.324
If the gravitation force of the Earth or anyone
of the galaxies changes, then be disaster,

03:05.404 --> 03:07.994
absolute disaster.

03:08.955 --> 03:15.789
So many things in the cosmos, if you study, the
coefficients that works out, the different balancing

03:15.869 --> 03:21.374
and the different weights and the movements of the
different bodies

03:21.454 --> 03:24.841
show us that there must be some purpose.

03:24.921 --> 03:33.674
And they do not trouble us; it’s all as
if made for the stage for human beings.

03:33.754 --> 03:40.864
That the human beings have to come on the stage and
all the preparation is made for the great drama.

03:41.544 --> 03:46.918
I think it’s high time that
great scientists should look at it

03:46.998 --> 03:51.685
and start wondering why is it the way it is made.

03:51.765 --> 03:56.289
Why we are so much looked after.

03:56.369 --> 04:05.133
The whole cosmos seems to be within ourselves
as if we have buttons, which move the cosmos,

04:05.213 --> 04:09.161
which control the cosmos.

04:09.241 --> 04:12.997
Everything is going on so smoothly otherwise,

04:13.078 --> 04:17.971
except when we do not try to understand ourselves.

04:19.349 --> 04:27.143
It has been said practically in all the
Scriptures that you have to seek your Self;

04:27.223 --> 04:30.196
you have to find your Self.

04:30.276 --> 04:38.008
Though I think many of this
Scriptures have been little bit changed

04:38.088 --> 04:42.189
and have been used for certain purposes,

04:42.269 --> 04:49.692
still they could not get over this point that you
have to become the Self,

04:49.772 --> 04:52.306
you have to be born again.

04:52.386 --> 04:56.275
But that is not an artificial thing.

04:56.355 --> 05:00.050
We are humane beings not artificially made.

05:00.130 --> 05:06.130
We are made really by some sort of a living
force from amoeba.

05:06.425 --> 05:13.263
We are not just made with some sort of a thinking
or a mental projection.

05:13.343 --> 05:20.711
It is not a mental projection by which we
have been human beings, it is something spontaneously

05:20.791 --> 05:25.695
happening, a living force within
us, which has brought us to this stage

05:25.775 --> 05:29.048
- with a purpose, with a meaning.

05:29.128 --> 05:35.810
And now at this stage we are free to do what
we like.

05:35.890 --> 05:40.970
Many people ask Me, “What was the need to
give this freedom to humane beings?”

05:41.050 --> 05:43.100
It was very necessary.

05:43.180 --> 05:50.639
If you have to have the ultimate freedom you
must know how to deal with it.

05:50.719 --> 05:52.100
You have to understand.

05:52.180 --> 05:55.213
Of course, humane beings have to make mistakes.

05:55.293 --> 05:57.503
To err is human.

05:57.583 --> 06:08.175
And we have to understand that this trial
– error and trial and error business –

06:08.256 --> 06:15.298
has made us understand, also those
who have not understood must understand,

06:15.378 --> 06:20.729
that there must be a wiser or surer way

06:20.809 --> 06:27.603
to achieve that goal of
Self-Realization, of Self-knowledge.

06:27.683 --> 06:32.607
Self-knowledge we do not have, we must admit
very humbly,

06:32.687 --> 06:38.180
we have had no system by
which we could know ourselves.

06:38.261 --> 06:42.219
But think of a computer that is a human being is.

06:42.299 --> 06:44.979
As soon as you see Me you know I am there.

06:45.059 --> 06:49.344
You don’t have to go for programming,
you don’t have to consult anything,

06:49.424 --> 06:59.651
you don’t have to use any kind of computer
or some sort of a complicated machinery,

06:59.731 --> 07:03.279
automatically, spontaneously
in a split of a second

07:03.359 --> 07:06.714
you know that I’m standing before you and talking
to you.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.431
Such a computer we can not create.

07:09.511 --> 07:14.338
But the Divine has created such a great computer
and that is the human being.

07:14.418 --> 07:20.603
And this human being is the only one
who is going to achieve that higher state,

07:20.683 --> 07:25.448
which we call as the spiritual state of the Self.

07:27.452 --> 07:32.979
Because in the science they deal
with the tree, I should say, the outside,

07:33.059 --> 07:37.078
but they can not go into the roots.

07:37.158 --> 07:41.528
To go into the roots you have to become a
subtler being.

07:41.608 --> 07:45.898
Unless and until you become a subtler being
you can not go into your roots to find out

07:45.979 --> 07:48.406
what are your roots are.

07:48.487 --> 07:51.576
And that is what is Self-Realization.

07:51.656 --> 07:56.449
When you become subtler then only you can
go into your being

07:56.541 --> 08:00.174
and can find out what actually
you are.

08:00.254 --> 08:08.325
Also to look after a tree, which has not know
its roots, is a very difficult thing.

08:08.405 --> 08:13.412
What happens is that when
you do not know your roots

08:13.492 --> 08:18.880
and you start growing, and growing,
and growing you go very deep down

08:18.960 --> 08:24.934
into that where you find
that you have lost your way.

08:25.034 --> 08:27.577
Actually you are not going deeper.

08:27.658 --> 08:31.021
You are spreading outside more and more.

08:31.101 --> 08:37.958
And then once you start going to extremes
because of your freedom you lose your way.

08:38.038 --> 08:42.740
That’s how today everybody is saying, “A
shock is going to come”.

08:42.820 --> 08:44.955
You are all going to face a shock.

08:45.035 --> 08:47.985
This is going to happen, that is going to
happen.

08:48.065 --> 08:55.199
But actually it is absolutely in your hands
because the whole of the cosmos is within you.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.630
The cosmos is working under your control complete.

08:59.711 --> 09:02.713
It is absolutely looking after you.

09:02.793 --> 09:12.012
Every element is looking after you to preserve you,
to guide you, to take you to the right thinking.

09:12.092 --> 09:14.372
But in your freedom you have to achieve that.
