Happy Diwali to All the Sahaja Yogis

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:17.880
From Mataji Nirmala Devi, Your Mother.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.160
27th of October 1981

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.400
Happy Diwali, Mother.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.040
He is very happy.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.720
Datta, what's happening to you?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.640
Very happy.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.400
All the joy.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.920
All are catching here, are they?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.640
Left Vishuddhi?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.880
All right, take it.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.680
Now, should we...? Have they come?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880
Warwick Road?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.200
Gayle, Gayle is not there and we have to wait for Gavin also.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.720
Gayle has not come as yet?

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.440
She is here. She's just gone out.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720
All right, she is here.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.960
So, she must have told Warwick Road people.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.800
Mother, Jeremy is working, Mother.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.360
And he is in Cambridge.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640
Who is?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.080
Jeremy is working.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.320
Working where?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.600
He's at work tonight.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.600
All right.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.080
He lives in Cambridge. So then Chhaya ...

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.040
Come along. Hello. How is Magda?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.440
She’s come?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.220
Coming, yes.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.720
All right, good, good.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200
May God bless you. You are all looking so nice.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.880
Thank You, Mother.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.960
Both of you, really looking very nice.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.960
Not very cold outside, is it?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440
No.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.960
Since I have come, I think the temperature has come up.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.280
Yes, exactly, isn't it?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.120
It was very cold, was that?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.040
Yes, it was.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040
Actually, when we were coming by plane only, they announced

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.320
it's three degrees.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.120
And then I've seen the temperature suddenly rose after that.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.640
Now you have to start walking.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
All right?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.960
Come along.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.400
This one is also very happy.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.800
All right?

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640
Very happy.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.120
Linda, take him back.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.560
As a... Where has she gone?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.600
She's not here.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.640
All right, then let her come. Let her come then.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.640
So how are you, all of you?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.200
Happy, Magda?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.400
Very happy to be here, Mother.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.120
America was difficult.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.960
Not so simple, I knew that.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.440
But we've done it, I mean

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.960
we've got centers everywhere now, in New York,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.920
we've got centers in,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.800
what's that place, is

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960
Santa Cruz,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.560
then one, maybe in Santa Monica we might get one

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080
and one in Los Angeles,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.760
one in,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.280
maybe Vancouver,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.640
I don't know, if we are about to have it, one there.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.720
Like that.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.800
The only place we didn't go was San Francisco.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.960
What a nice sari!

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680
Looking so nice.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.360
This is the, all the spring colours are there in the sari.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.960
You see, what you should do is to stitch it up for her

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.160
so that it is easier for her to wear like a lehenga.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.960
And you will also have a sari, will you?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.760
You want to have a sari, also?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.720
Ha, Nicki?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.120
I'll get you one small sari, all right?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.640
And then you can wear it like this, like her.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.640
No?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.040
You feel shy?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.800
Did she go to Maria?

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.640
Yes, she's happy.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.200
Is she quite happy with Maria?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.960
Yes.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.960
Maria has a problem, a little bit.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.840
What about Pat and all these people? Are they not back from work?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.320
Grace is coming.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.280
Grace?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.240
Grace will be coming here.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.800
Coming.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.440
And Houston of course, Houston was such a big success.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.840
For the first meeting there were forty-five people.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040
I mean, the repeat.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.840
After My coming so,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.680
already there are forty-five working.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400
Santa Cruz we had lots of people.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.960
Next time I think we'll do much better,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.920
because I met a man who was very, very

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.040
influential person, extremely influential.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.880
He knows all the Congress men, this thing, that thing,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.200
and he's an Indian.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.880
They said if this man does something,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.200
then something will happen.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.160
We went and met him and he was very nice

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.920
and he said that, "You should have come

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.960
earlier and You should have let me know

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.800
of the complete program and then I would have put You

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.640
on all the medias and everything, I'll work it out."

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.680
He said that, "Next time when You come, give me

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.040
at least a month or two months notice and I'll

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.920
put You up."  Because to go to these

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.240
medias there, it's very difficult

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.560
and you have to pay a lot of money just to get into it.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.560
Hello, Pat! How are you?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.880
Hi, Mother. How lovely to see You.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840
What about David?

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.560
Is he not coming?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.680
I think, I don't know. David, he stays here?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.880
Yes, Mother.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.960
Are you, are you recording?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.960
Keep it for a while, then do it.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.560
So anybody who is trying to come?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.760
Are there any plans?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.880
In England?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600
Not yet known.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.960
Annie from France will come in India.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.240
France people are different, but from England, those who are coming.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.120
What do you think, Nick? Why don't you come?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.240
If I can go, yes.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.880
Nick, you should, I think.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.320
It will be a good idea.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.200
Will be good idea for you.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.680
What about you, Cathy? All right.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.840
Marcus, what do you think?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.240
I've been for certain years.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.200
You should try,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.960
it would be a good idea.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.560
All left-sided people.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.680
It's a good idea.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.400
What do you think about? Felicity?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.120
Where is she?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.880
I'd like to be there.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.280
You have no money?

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.400
Well, I'm working. You see, I

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.880
it's just when I start teaching again.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.960
So, you won't be able to take leave?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.800
Maybe for Australia, Mother, but ...

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.440
Australia but not India.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.080
You can go to Australia?

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.120
Yes, that might be my future holiday.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.040
It's difficult taking time off work, because we get holidays.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.720
If you are going to Australia will be no change to you.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.960
I mean, India is the place where one should go.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.680
Australia is another Western country.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.400
I'll ask. I'd like to come, Mother.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120
Try.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.120
Especially when you go to those villages, it is very

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.880
pure land, you know.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.960
People are very pure there.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.320
Isn't it, don't you think so, it helps a lot?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.640
Very simple people and meeting them, you see,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.400
many problems can get solved.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.760
And what about you?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.200
I might go to India.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.240
You try, at least.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.400
I wanted Christine to come.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.560
She requires it very much.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.600
Maybe Kate might come.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.960
Patricia, what about you?

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.320
I want to come.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.960
I think you better do it, once again.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.840
Kay is coming as well, Mother.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.280
Kay will be coming, I know.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.160
Mother, I think ...

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.920
Who's there?

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.320
I think Bernard said he wanted to come and, if he's serious about.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.440
Bernard,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.080
from the hotel said he wanted to go to India.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.820
Is it?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.960
Yes, Mother.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.880
So, get all their names.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.080
What about you?

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.840
Me?

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.080
I'd love to, Mother, but how am I going to [fund] it though?

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.360
Yeah, I mean all those who can manage.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.840
You should experience after all.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.960
You see, the atmosphere and everything...

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.560
You know, people are so sensitive there.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.000
Simple people living with simple lives,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.920
not complicated, they don’t think so much,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.920
and their style is very

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.960
slow-paced and you have to keep pace with them.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.320
So, you bring down... Neesha has run away.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.200
Last time we were there only for three days,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.720
where they didn't want you to stay there.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320
We ran out.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.360
Kharus was a good place we went to.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.960
But this time we'll have another route,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.680
some other places we can go to.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.320
Raulbai has gone to Baroda

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.760
and she wants you all to go to Baroda also.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.360
Instead of going by plane, why don't you all go by train

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.360
from Bombay to Delhi?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.160
So you can do many other places on the way.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.280
You can go to Baroda, you can go to...

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.160
Ahmedabad or something.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.760
It's always good, because you leave your vibrations

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.080
in all these places.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.960
You can also go by bus if you want to.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.720
You can have two buses hired.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720
It will take about...

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.400
I think two days to go to Delhi, two days.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.560
Two or three days, at the most.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.400
But, I mean, you'll vibrate the whole place,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.280
you'll go around, it would be good idea.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.840
Good, good, very good, very good, very good.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.160
She knows how far...

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.400
She's treating everybody's Agnya and Sahastrara.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880
No?

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960
Good.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240
No?

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.160
And she takes out like that also, you know, like this...

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.040
That's how they do it.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.560
Even Olympia does that, you must have noticed, like this.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.960
Chhaya has not come, Regis and all these people either.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.960
I hope they know, they have to come.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.960
They're coming, Mother. They come back from [UNCLEAR].

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240
All right.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.840
I think I have said we can have again a little,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.120
what you call a feed-back.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.720
Mother, if we could have a big public meeting

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.240
and get...

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440
How are you?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.960
How are you? What?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.240
How are you?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.960
Do you want tea?

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360
It's very hot.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.160
Otherwise it was out. You take this.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360
Little bit.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.920
What language is that?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.840
Divine language?

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.440
You don't want this?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.840
This is what you want? All right.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400
What is it?

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.640
It's hot.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800
How will she eat?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.920
She likes channa only, you know?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.400
All realized...

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.680
But this channa is hot...

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.960
Have you got another channa?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.280
How are you?

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.680
How is going on?

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.560
Brother's marriage?

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920
20-th December.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.000
Means December?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.240
December.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.600
So you will go?

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.600
And he? Douglas, are you coming?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.160
I'm afraid not, I'm not able to.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.400
However, I'd like Devyani to go.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.800
Now is sitting in my lap.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.160
I have to give that to Aradhana.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.040
She has been inquiring about Olympia, about Orio,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.640
and everyone she has been inquiring.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.080
We have lots of photographs.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.040
Peter have brought some photographs...

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.960
Have you got some?

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.680
Yes, about fifteen of them.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.640
So how are you doing now?

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760
How is Pat?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960
Very well, Mother.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.960
Have you come? All right, come along, sit down.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.200
Linda, you can give him.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.280
I do not want him to to eat all that. Little bit.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.680
They make a powder out of it, among Greek people,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.680
they do it, you see, and make some sort of a chutney.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.240
They make a powder and

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.840
paste and they eat it with that.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.960
Hello. How are you?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.880
Very well, thank you.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.760
You've come from Brighton?

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.380
Yes, Mother.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.920
What about others?

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.160
Pamela, is she coming?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.120
We have a meeting in Brighton, this evening, Mother.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.160
We have a meeting in Brighton this evening.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.920
Should we start now?

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120
But today

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.920
I want to tell you about

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.800
the celebration

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.400
of this night

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960
called as Lakshmi Puja.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.960
It is the day

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.240
when they worship

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320
Lakshmi.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.320
So, one has to understand

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120
that

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.760
Lakshmi represents the power

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.240
by which we evolve.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.640
Is the power by we are redeemed,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960
redeeming power;

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.280
by which we improve

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.960
from

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.280
baser self

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600
to higher.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440
To begin with,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.720
you see, is the Lakshmi form.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.080
First is the Lakshmi.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.320
Now, this Lakshmi

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200
came out of

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.840
the great churning

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.720
called as Amrutmanthan,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.320
for which I'll give you another lecture some other time.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.560
But

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.400
this

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.880
Lakshmi that came out of

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.960
the churning

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.960
represents

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.320
our seeking into our own well-being.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.120
So, first of all,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.400
we have basic

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.240
seekings, like food.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.880
In the animal stage we seek food.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.760
And, with that seeking only,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.960
we developed

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080
into

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.720
sometimes very cunning animals, sometimes very ferocious animals

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.360
and sometimes very timid animals.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.800
Because they could not find food,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.120
so they had to hide and slay animals.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200
So the food

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.560
was the beginning, I should say,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.440
of this Lakshmi tattwa.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.960
But

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.120
when She becomes actually

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.320
the Lakshmi, then

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.200
She has a form

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.960
that suggests that the Spirit of Lakshmi

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.920
is

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.960
for the total well-being of human beings, total well-being.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.960
Now, totality is different from

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.880
partly, because in evolution, you see, you grow partly,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.360
till you reach a stage where you really achieve your

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.880
total well-being.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.360
And now, you know that, without realization

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.080
your well-being has no meaning.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.680
So, She has

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.640
arisen out of the sea,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.080
so She is

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.400
Miriam, you can call Her. She is Marie,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.600
She is Marie. That's why Christ's Mother's name was Mary

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.800
because She came out of the sea.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.560
People, I don't know if they think about it, why She was called

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.800
Mary, of all the things. Why this name, Mary?

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.800
Now, this

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.280
power which came out of the sea,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880
because

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.720
the whole thing, the seeking started in the sea, first of all,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.960
as you know. It had to be in the sea, because

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.000
first animals were born in the sea only.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.080
Becomes, when She comes out of the sea,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840
becomes

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.040
a Raja Lakshmi

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.760
and a Gruha Lakshmi.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.000
Raja Lakshmi is the One

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.320
where collectively

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.840
collectively you enjoy your well-being.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.680
Collectively.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.840
On the right hand side you can say.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.600
Like, we have

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.920
some places which are for public usage, here,

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.880
public well-being.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.280
And Gruha Lakshmi is the one which is for the individual,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.320
individual well-being.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.320
So we have the essence of Lakshmi

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.720
and then we have,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.960
when we evolved

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.000
we started having our homes, houses,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.620
our own family, our own private life, our these things.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.440
So we had,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.240
Gruha Lakshmi.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.320
And then they started having collective,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.560
like we can say, the queen represents here Raja Lakshmi.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.120
A queen represents

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.880
here a Raja Lakshmi of England.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.200
She is a symbol of that.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.560
Our queen here is the symbol of that Raja Lakshmi.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.960
You know the word "raja" means

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.560
the kingdom or you can say the

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.280
the royal,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.600
royal kind of the reality.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.600
So when the Lakshmi is a regal Lakshmi, She is for collectivity.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.120
So the queen doesn't

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.320
live for herself, she lives for

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.960
all the collective being.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.440
In the same way, the Raja Lakshmi

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.120
is the One that is for all of us.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.960
For example this place we got here,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.760
it's through the blessings of Raja Lakshmi.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.120
She gave us this place.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.400
Her power gave us this place to live,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.840
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.280
you are the epitome of evolution,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.880
you are the highest people in the evolution,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.960
you are the ones who are looked after by God,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.840
you are the most important people.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.160
It's true.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.960
And you know She provided for you.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.160
You should have no problem of money, you should have no problem

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.640
of housing, you should have no problem of anything.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.320
So it is She, the Raja Lakshmi, who gives you all that.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.080
Then you have your wife,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.960
as Gruha Lakshmi.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.800
So we have to have a wife as Gruha Lakshmi.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.160
These two things one should understand very, very clearly

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.920
because we confuse them.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.640
Wife is a Gruha Lakshmi, is the one, she is the Goddess

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.440
of the household.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.600
Now she has to be the Goddess also.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.400
I mean she just doesn't become Goddess

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.960
just by becoming. You have to become again.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.120
You have to become the Goddess.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.720
And the Goddess

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.640
of the Gruha Lakshmi

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.720
is, we can say,

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.360
that the deity of the gruha, of the house,

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.880
is the Gruha Lakshmi.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.200
Now this deity must become one with the housewife.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.760
Then the blessings

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.360
of the Lakshmi

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.680
essence, is of well-being comes to you.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.760
If she is not the Goddess, you'll always suffer.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.280
You'll always have problems.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.880
You'll always have

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.440
all kinds of untold miseries.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.320
It is Her blessings which brings you solace,

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.160
peace and redemption - redemption is the word - of anything.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.080
So that's why the left Nabhi is very important

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.880
as you know, and that is always bad in the present.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.640
So I would say that the whole society is responsible

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.000
for spoiling that,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.160
because housewife is not respected

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.560
first of all. We should blame our society.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.800
Our housewives are not respected.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.400
Housewife, the one who is a dedicated wife, even

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.720
is placed higher than yatis.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.440
Yatis are the highest evolved,

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.040
you can say, avdutas are the highest evolved

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.960
seers,

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.280
and a dedicated wife

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.800
has got more powers

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.400
than even a yati - it is said so.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.440
And even Krishna was

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.000
little worried about them.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.560
Everybody had to worry.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960
So the dedicated wife, you see,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.960
the Gruha Lakshmi, is such an important thing,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.960
because she is the essence

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.680
of this well-being, which is peace.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.760
I think I have so far never talked to you about peace.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.960
And peace is only achieved through the Gruha Lakshmi,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.960
through your proper

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.840
adjustment of your spleen I should say.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.440
Because spleen is the giver

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.160
of the

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.120
blood cells. All right?

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.360
It creates the nutrition for the whole body.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.000
If there is no peace

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.960
in that area within us,

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.960
the whole

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.200
system can go out because that's the nourishing

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.440
center  within us, that's the nourishing center.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.000
And that center which nourishes also peace,

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.160
it is the peace. You must have heard this:

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.720
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena saonsthita".

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.680
The Goddess that is the Shanti

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.800
which is present in every human being as peace.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.720
So this peace is only possible if the housewives

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.440
realize their importance,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.320
bear it upon of themselves, are forgiving

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.800
and are redeeming

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.800
the family life. They have to redeem the family life.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.280
And where this gets spoiled the whole system goes out.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.960
See, America, I went

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.320
and I found all of them have got left Nabhi.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.600
All right. And they are very violent.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.880
Very violent, extremely violent.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.040
And what I felt that in the beginning,

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.400
the society neglected the housewives,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.880
the institution of housewife which is a Goddess.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.960
And now the women cannot forgive them.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.080
Because the women cannot forgive them, you see, it has become a big

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.800
struggle there.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.840
The children have become violent.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.560
I mean if the housewives are not all right

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.920
there will be always violence.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.960
I'll give you the example in India.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.720
We have in the north and the south

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.640
two types of systems

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.960
because in the north the muslims ruled and they had

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.720
the system of keeping the women in the purdah system and all those

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.600
and lot of prostitution and all those ideas came

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.160
through those horrible nawabs who ruled in the north.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.440
In the south it was the other way round,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.560
because they kept to the dharma and all those things

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.440
and they wouldn't accept this kind of a

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.320
nonsensical ideas. They looked after their women.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.440
Even the people of the north sometimes say

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.720
that the, I mean the south people are very

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.960
sort of henpecked or whatever it is,  say Maharashtra downward.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.120
Now, because of that,

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.960
there is so much of difference in the law and order system

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.960
in that same country.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.280
For example in Maharashtra if you are going by bus in the night

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.680
anytime, two o'clock you have seen,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.080
nobody plunders you,

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.840
nobody is bothered, the bus is going through.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.000
You can live here, stay here, nobody steals anything.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.560
The servants in Maharashtra

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.800
are so good, they'll never touch your things.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.960
I mean you can leave the keys with them.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.920
They will do all your house up and they will

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.440
never touch anything, your money, anything they cannot touch,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.760
they will never touch.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.960
Same about any funds or anything like,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.400
we can say our

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.800
Sahaja Yoga funds, never a problem in Maharashtra.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.760
Say puja funds and all that,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.280
all these things they understand.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.880
But the main thing is

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.960
the housewife in Maharashtra is an important thing, very important.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.800
So in the house she is the,

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.640
she is the lady. And the lord is outside.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.560
Whatever she says, goes.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.640
But when it is the other way round, everything goes upside down.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.000
It can never be blissful.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.720
But that doesn't mean that

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.240
the woman should also say outside as well as inside.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.880
I mean the woman should not interfere

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.680
with the husband's work in the office, should not dominate there.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.280
Like so many these women, like Chang Kai-Shek's wife did

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.960
and all these people did. That's not necessary.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.080
She should be a support.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.800
But in the house

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.960
she is the one who should be respected.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.280
She must be respected in the household,

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.080
otherwise there cannot be auspiciousness,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.840
there cannot be peace.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.960
And peace is the gift

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.720
of Gruha Lakshmi.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.400
Now some people may say, "Oh, it's all right,

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.120
they are not having a good time, the wife is bad,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.200
but she's got money."  Money it's not Lakshmi.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.640
This confusion must be absolutely removed from your mind.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.600
And last time I explained to you what Lakshmi is.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.160
But you can go through again that tape, if you want to.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.040
But I'll tell you for short,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.280
that Lakshmi has got four hands.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.440
And She stands on a lotus.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.200
And She is a body with a, which is

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.680
I mean, not a slim type of a body,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.280
but She has a substantial body, but She stands on a lotus.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.720
Means wherever She lives, you see,

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.880
She doesn't show Her presence

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.800
by staying. She is so,

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.960
so beautiful that She adjusts Herself even on a lotus.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.320
She doesn't exert Her weight.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.120
Like, cheap women do, anywhere they go, they'll say,

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.440
"Oh, I don't like this and I like that

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.320
and I would like to have this and

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.040
I would like to sleep in a place like this and

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.120
I, I like this type of thing."

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.280
So the first quality of a woman who is a Lakshmi is adjustability.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.960
See, no one feels her when she is there

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.960
nobody feels. Only thing they can feel her fragrance like a lotus.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.280
I mean that's the sign of a woman who adjusts herself.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.320
She is not bothered about her own life

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.800
but she's bothered about others.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.920
Now we had a very funny incident.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.400
We had a lady from Germany.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.960
And I told them that

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.080
it's better that the girls should wait

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.960
till the boys have their food, look after them,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.960
and then the girls can have their food, you see.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.400
It's better. And she felt insulted.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.120
On the contrary it is invariably done in India. Invariably.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.240
That the woman will always wait

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.760
till the husband finishes the food,

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.600
because she can look after him better.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.880
I mean it's a privilege.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.760
It's more matured

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.760
that you can look after your husband,

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.000
that you can look after your children.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.320
It's your job, you are responsible for it.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.640
You are the lady of the house, you are supposed to do it.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.840
Like Seema told Me that

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.960
here nobody asks you for food or anything.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.120
Everybody is eating, whatever they want to eat

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.960
they go and eat anytime, they want, they will eat anytime.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.280
They go on eating and eating and eating.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.680
Nobody asks that you come and have food or anything.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.080
That's done in India.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.200
So she said, "I waited for a day, nobody asked me.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.680
Then I said I better take something for myself."

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.760
So the ladies have to take up upon themselves

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.400
that they invite people, ask them to eat

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.160
and cook for them special things.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.080
You see this is the job of a woman.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.680
She has to develop these qualities,

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.600
the womanly qualities, of feeding

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.600
men, looking after them when they come to their house.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.200
She should not make faces

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.320
and try to show, "This is my private house.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.800
Nobody come in the house."

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.320
She should be the one who

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.040
should welcome more than the husband should. She should be.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.680
She should be the one whom people should feel closer to

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.840
like the brothers and sisters of the husband,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.720
or relations. She should be the one who should give that

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.640
feeling of security, of peace and of

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.560
welcoming the guests. It is her job. Then she becomes the Lakshmi.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.400
So the well-being is not only that you have money.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.960
So what happens with Her, the well-being part of it?

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.160
That She has in one hand,

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.560
the hand is like this,

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.840
that means that with one hand it should flow.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.240
Generous - it should go.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.400
She must give, She must give, She must give.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.320
And She should not demand at all.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.320
Others should say that you must have this.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.960
An example I'll say, that for the last, I think,

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.240
four years C.P. is trying to buy one faultless ring for Me.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.640
Because I gave away all My diamonds to My daughter.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.440
Try it, try it - cannot do it. Just try, just try - neutralize it.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.880
"No, not this time, next time, this time, that time". I'm just...

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.280
Because you see, I know he wants to buy that position for Me.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.640
Isn't it? So I'm postponing it,

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.600
"It's all right, we'll do it. Now [money] used to have a house",

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.960
and this and that. Like that.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.600
So the demanding you see, that "Give Me this" - there's no need.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.760
Let, let the men start seeing that, "Oh, she doesn't have this.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.800
She should have this."

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.960
It is they who should do it and the woman should never demand.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.920
It's a sign of bad manners actually, according to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.200
You should never demand for anything.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.800
You should have forbearing, you should be able to

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.560
bear it, not with a sort of a big martyrdom,

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.560
"Oh, I'm bearing up" and all that. No.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.880
But with the understanding that you are grown up and you are

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.960
matured, you are supposed to bear it up.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.200
Now the responsibility on men also is there,

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:39.040
that when she is giving, they should allow her to give, you see.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.840
But I find it's the other way round, where

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.720
is that the women are not so generous as the men are.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.160
It's the other way round, you see.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.440
Women are, you see - if they find somebody has come to their house

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.320
they will secretly go and cook something and pass it on,

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.960
they let the husband not see.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.400
They feel that satisfaction of Annapurna,

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.320
you see, the feeding.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.560
That feeling of feeding your own child,

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.680
of feeding somebody else who has come you see,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.160
from the back door they just pass on something which husband don't see.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.080
Very sweet it is, very sweet it is.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.560
It is something they, I think they are

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.960
brought up that way or they inculcated.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.760
So it's such a nice thing that you can feed someone.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.640
Or, if somebody is coming, then they know what that person eats,

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.880
so they'll cook it very sweetly and keep it.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.080
And then when the person comes in, they'll

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.560
put forward that, "This should be given".

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.800
So the man has to hide his money,

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.600
because the wife will be giving away.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.960
It's the other way round.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.720
But when the woman starts becoming selfish and self-centered,

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.680
and worried about money and all that,

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.640
then it's a wrong thing. She should not be

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.000
extravagant about herself,

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.960
like going to

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.760
some place, buying something expensive for yourself

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.160
then going somewhere buying something expensive for yourself.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.760
But doing for your husband, doing for your children,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.040
doing for others, and automatically they do for you.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.120
They are anxious to do it.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.880
Just start thinking on those lines.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.720
But now for men, they must also understand

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.640
that they have to have that due.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.440
You see, this ego oriented society is very tilted one.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.960
If you just say, "All right, do what you please.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.680
You have this money, you spend this money",

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.200
then the men, you see, they can

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.880
just take it for granted, ego-oriented, you see.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.920
They can just take you for granted and say, "All right.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.360
Then don't give her anything."

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.960
So when the mutual understanding is not there,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.640
when there is an imbalance, then these things come up.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.720
But in Sahaja Yoga we should understand.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.720
You have to look after your wife, her needs, everything,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920
you have to give her due respect.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.440
You are never to insult her in the presence of others.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.880
It's absolutely forbidden.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.160
But the women also

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.120
should know how to respect their husbands, not to be provocative,

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.680
and use all their cunning against their husband.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.240
You see, I've seen people sit down and plan out

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.200
how they will insult their husband, in what way.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.320
This is absolutely, you have to love your husband,

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.240
you have to really love him and forgive him like

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.600
you would forgive your own child, in the same way.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.040
But the husband also, it's a very mutual thing.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.960
I cannot just tell something to the women and not to the men.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.400
It's absolutely essential, that men must respect their women

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.720
as goddess.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.360
As goddess. But women have to behave like goddesses.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.560
If they behave like street women

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.840
then a competition starts, the man behaves like a

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.960
street man and the woman behaves like a street woman.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.960
Then they behave like Soho people, then they behave like that.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.840
I mean it goes on, competition.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.720
But if you have to synthesize it, to bring to the balance,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.920
then both of you must decide

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.760
that you can only enjoy

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.960
if you have proper balance system among yourselves.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.040
One person goes one way, another person goes that way.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.280
There's no end to it.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.760
There’s no end to it and the

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.320
chariot will never move forward, you see.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.400
Both the wheels have to be balanced,

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.120
realizing that,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.680
without this wheel the another cannot exist,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.160
so this is as important as the other.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.040
But they will say that, "I'm important."

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.880
No, she is important, if I have to exist.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.960
Or she has to say,

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.400
"He is important because I have to exist".

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.000
It's such a mutual thing, so the,

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.800
to get the Gruha Lakshmi point I must say that

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.960
the woman should behave like a Gruha Lakshmi, with her dignity.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.440
I mean it is really indignified even to ask them to. Why?

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.040
What is to ask? It's your all own, your own,

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.960
whenever you want to get married.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.760
Try to develop that theory within you.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.240
And the men respect their women as, really as,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.080
Gruha Lakshmis.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.800
It's very good, respect them, look after them,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.840
and know that the deities, once they are identified

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.200
with your wife, you'll have no problems.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.280
Now, on the other hand, She has one hand of protection,

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.800
that the Lakshmi gives protection.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.760
Always gives protection to everyone.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.680
Even against the husband, even against the husband She protects.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.640
Say, for example, I'll say my own sister-in-law

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.680
was such a Lakshmi like that, we had.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.720
My own sister-in-law was like that.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.320
And, if I was bothered - was little,

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.360
because they were much older than us, you see, was hard on us -

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.720
so she use to come out,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.200
with the protection. She said, "No, how can you say that to them?"

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.960
So sweet she was, you can't imagine.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.840
And then the brother, I mean, my own brother,

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.880
you see, she would say that, "No, you can't do this to your sister."

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.960
Same thing with Me, my own sister-in-law

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.280
was more attached to Me than to My husband for the same reason,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.280
because I would always protect her against even the husband.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.080
Though he is her brother.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.800
I mean naturally they are very close to each other, naturally.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.440
But you should protect their interest

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.960
to that extent, than protect yourself only.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.120
Protect those who come to your house - that is her duty.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.920
If she does it, she can do it very well. Now,

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.960
I'll give you one of the examples

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.080
in My own lifetime. I was in Delhi,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.560
and that time this trouble had started of,

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.680
what you call, this

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.720
partition and many

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.400
people ran here helter-skelter. And

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.040
once I was just sitting outside my father's house, I was knitting,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.560
because Kalpana was to be born and I was sitting outside.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.040
And a lady came to Me and she said,

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.120
"We are refugees, we have no place to go to."

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.160
And, "Will you be able to give Me some place in your house?"

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.960
I said, "All right." It was a huge house of My father.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.320
I said, "It's such a big house,

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.760
and we have a room to get outside which you can use

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.000
and also you can have a kitchen there and a bathroom, we can set."

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.280
She said to me, "We have a friend and my husband.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.280
Can we stay here?" I said, "All right."

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.760
So we arranged for them to stay there.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.080
And it so happened that

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.600
people

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.280
in My family didn't like it very much.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.640
Specially My brother, you see, My husband told him that

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.960
"I don't like

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.960
this lady to be here. God knows what sort of a lady she is," and

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.160
My brother said, "Now, if she has said it,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.000
if my sister has said it, I can't say anything,

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.240
cause She's the one who has to decide about this house.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.720
So it is her, her job to decide, so I can't say anything."

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.840
So, they all kept quiet about it and they stayed over.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.760
And this man, her friend,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.080
her husband's friend, was a Muslim.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.320
And there was a big riot

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.320
in Delhi, very big riot.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.920
And so many Hindus, you see, like these

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.320
Jan Sanghis and fundamentalists, they had formed a

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.400
horrible group which was killing many Muslims also.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.880
So from the servants and all that they must have known

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.720
that there's a Muslim staying in this house.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.160
So they came to My house, about five, six of them with

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.680
clubs and this and that.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.320
So they, these people got frightened. So I told this Muslim,

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.120
I said, "You go and hide in My room. I'll go and face them."

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.680
I went outside.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.960
So they said, "We have heard there's a Muslim in your house."

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.200
I said, "No, there isn't."

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.080
Because that's not their right to know.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.680
I said, "There isn't any Muslim in this house."

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.240
They said,

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.840
"We'll have to

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.360
go and search." I said, "You cannot.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.640
If you have to go, you have to kill Me and then go".

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.960
And now they saw My big tikka and all that.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.920
"You cannot get inside the house. If you have to go, I'll stand here.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.920
You cannot go in My house at all. You cannot enter."

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.160
And they left. They knew there was a Muslim

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.920
otherwise I would not protest so much.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.160
But because I was protecting they could not enter, so they just went away.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.200
And the fellow was saved.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.960
Then this lady became a very big, well-known actress

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.960
in India and she did lots of things. I mean

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.320
that, I mean the whole thing then changed her.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.960
But what I am saying, that

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.760
a housewife has to protect.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.960
The Lakshmi has to protect, the man who has money must protect.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.920
See, they must have people in his ashraya, means, in his protection,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.960
like servants you can have,

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.120
servant's family. Some people treat their servants very badly

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.960
and they are very, very, very

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.280
they ill-treat and

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.960
that's not the way a Gruha Lakshmi is to be.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.320
Or, anybody, say some students are staying in the house,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.680
or some children are staying, some say,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.960
you have some people in the house like lodgers you can say, or

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.960
Sahaja Yogis now, staying say

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.840
with people who are to be looked after, with women,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.080
they have to protect, always,

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.960
from others - that is the job of a Lakshmi.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.280
The mother has to protect her children.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.960
Whatever may be wrong with the children, but

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.040
she has to protect her children against all the rest of the people.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.800
Of course, not in wrong things. I mean she should not tell,

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.360
I mean, always I have to tell the other side of it because

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.840
you might say that, "My child has gone and beaten somebody else."

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.160
So that's not good, that is not protection.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.320
What I am saying, if the children are

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.840
under any peril or any trouble,

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.960
it is the Lakshmi who has to protect.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.560
This is the job of the Gruha Lakshmi.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.800
Right side is the Raja Lakshmi.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.280
The Raja Lakshmi

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.960
is the, we can say, the queen of a place.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.320
Now, here the queen and king is one.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.400
But, what I am saying,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.280
where the king and the queen are too different,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.080
then the queen of the thing has to have that dignity.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.720
Thank God our queen is quite a Raja Lakshmi, I must say.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800
I'm very happy with her.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.000
She has that dignity and she has that sense and

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.360
she is a sweet lady and she is really a good person.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.840
Thank God you have a good lady and

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.800
Diana also is another realized soul who is coming now,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.680
will be another blessing for you.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.680
So it is her well-being, you see,

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.800
her, I should say, the essence of well-being

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.600
permeates that peace, that happiness and that good thing.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.320
If supposing a man is a president is there

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.960
and his wife is a very funny woman, like this

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.320
Kennedy's wife was, there can never be peace,

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.960
neither in the society, nor

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.160
because wherever she'll go she'll create a problem.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.880
You see, she’ll go to a society,

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.400
she being the First Lady, everybody will try to follow her.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.880
You see here also, you know that when

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.960
Queen Elizabeth had some sort of a problem on her neck,

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.920
she had some sort of a patch or something,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.720
so she started using a collar.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.240
And everybody had that Elizabethian collar,

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.280
all these things, like

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.960
whatever

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.360
problems, say, Victoria had, and she made a dress,

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.400
others had to wear the same types of dress. So,

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.320
all the collective patterns and fashions and all those things

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.240
come through this First Lady.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.680
So the First Lady is the Raja Lakshmi.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.960
And one has to respect

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.600
that Raja Lakshmi, as the woman who is a queen.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.880
Now for example this country is already cursed

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.840
because seven queens were

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.360
killed in this country, I mean already cursed, I must say.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.080
It's a horrible thing,

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.120
I mean, how did people allow any one king to be

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.120
doing that. Seven of them, it's too much.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.720
Is already a curse here.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.400
So this kind of a thing is, we can go to a point with these things:

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.280
at the most you can arrest, or at the most I mean if ...

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.840
I mean, these are not, of course, good women,

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.360
I was telling you about those who are like that.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.600
For example Mao's wife,

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.040
whom they thought was not so good and all that.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.200
But one should not humiliate,

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.640
because if you humiliate then, then you are humiliating

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.960
that principle of Raja Lakshmi.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.440
And then to put them to imprisonment,

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.440
and to kill them like this and wash their dirty linens on the street,

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.120
means there is no dignity at all about it, you see.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.960
So we have to keep the dignity, the serenity of a Raja Lakshmi,

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.400
and that Raja Lakshmi is very important for England.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.960
Because we are missing in Raja Lakshmi nowadays.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.360
And that Raja Lakshmi comes through the activity of the people.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.240
And if you are inactive, Raja Lakshmi will go down.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.440
So we come to the point that we have to be active.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.280
We have to be active producing more wealth.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.280
You see, not like taking out the wealth from here

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.080
putting to something else, but we should produce more wealth.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.400
How do you produce more wealth? You should see that.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.080
By changing form, by anything.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.840
We should get to it that we should produce more wealth.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.120
For example if Sahaja Yogis think that,

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.200
"All right, I am not going to work and I am going to sit at home and

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.040
I'm just going to be a, sort of a dishwasher,"

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.080
that's not the way.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.960
Sahaja Yogis have not only to work,

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.560
but to work according to their deserving.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.960
Apart from that, they should improve.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.280
Like

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.960
you see somebody, "Oh, I'm all right, I can paint a little bit,

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.320
but if it comes to something, better painting,

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.240
then I think I'll have to get somebody else."

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.840
That means at least you don't know even painting.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.760
You have to, in activity, you must know that you must perfect

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.240
as profession.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.320
All the Sahaja Yogis must have a profession. You just perfect it.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.440
It's not like this that, "I am, I'm just a waster.

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.840
All right, accepted the situation, I'm a waster,

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.720
sitting like a waster, and doing no activity."

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.160
Only, then the problems, like the ones we had, come up,

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.640
that you start earning money out of women or do sort of

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.400
useless things like

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.320
swindling and telling stories, taking out money.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.880
So wasters are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.960
Anybody who tries to be a waster will be thrown out.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.000
Never justify your

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.800
inefficiency, inadequacy, or incompetence.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.560
You have to be first class competent people,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.720
in every respect.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.360
There should be no diffidence in you.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.320
If there is diffidence, you are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.200
So, not that you should get after the money, but Raja Lakshmi,

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.320
means there should be complete activity

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.240
of your complete manifestation of all your qualities.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.080
Try to improve it, try to improve.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.240
That doesn't mean you run a rat race,

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.360
like a madcap, nothing of Sahaja Yoga, not that.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.040
It doesn't mean that. I have to warn you there.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.680
But you should not be just a waster, you see, that you don't have two

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.640
pounds here and you go on, like a beggar you are moving about.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.960
This is not proper.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.960
Try to improve your condition, try to improve your technique.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.800
Try to improve your competence and understanding

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.720
of the whole subject, whatever you take up, take up this or that.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.800
Get it to it and work it out, sort it out.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.240
You should be called... you can do it with Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.640
This is one of the big problems we have of Sahaja Yogis,

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.440
do you know that?

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.040
One of the biggest problems.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.560
Because nobody is impressed by you.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.880
Nobody is impressed.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.640
They think some loonies have gathered around Me.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.280
Nobody is impressed.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.200
Everybody looks like a confused personality,

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.440
you see, walking like this.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.440
They think that Mother must have mesmerized them,

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.320
and they are all moving like a wave to this and that.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.560
So today, on a Diwali day,

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.960
we have to say that, "We'll become more competent, expert

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.600
in whatever we are doing. We have to do it.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.960
We have to be people with impression."

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.960
Now, what impresses people,

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.840
in this world? Only two things.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.760
Either,

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.320
in the beginning -

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.600
in superficiality, only two things can impress, in superficiality.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.640
Because firstly they are superficial.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.040
When they will see us, they will see our superficial only.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.400
First they will see, what are you.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.840
I mean if you look like a drunkard, nobody is going to follow you.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.160
If you look like a hippie, nobody is going to follow you.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.960
Nobody has any faith in hippies, I must tell you very frankly,

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.560
anymore.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.800
It's an individual system.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.320
If you work on... You cannot be leaders.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.920
If you have to be leaders you are not to be hippies at all.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.920
Which hippie has been a leader so far, you tell Me?

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.080
Of course, this, now this thing is dying out,

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.400
this thing is dying out. We should think about it seriously.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.960
That this hippism it's got just a craze, it's dying out.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.840
Then another craze came in, dying out,

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.080
that another craze. We are not crazy people.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.760
We should know our goal how we are doing. We have to impress people.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.960
Now only we can impress them superficially, because

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.120
in the beginning people just see superficial facts.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.960
So the first thing is that we should be such

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.000
that we should have competence.

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.920
We should - say for example, if you have to make a speech,

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.760
you should know how to make speeches.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.440
Now, people when they speak, either

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.320
they cannot impress or they go on like mad

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.840
they put down their heads and say something. That's not the way.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.120
You must practice it. Go to the sea, go anywhere in the open,

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.920
say loudly. You can go, say, for example, to

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.960
this,

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.040
you got Hyde Park.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.920
And say loudly what you have to say. Say loudly.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.560
Practice it. Say how you, practice it, overcome your defect.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.960
Do not enjoy your defect. It's not the way. Now no more time left

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240
for that kind of a thing.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.960
Because there is no impression of people on others.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.640
They are not impressed by you.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.920
You see, with Me whatever is impressed is all right.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.840
But you have to become the gurus, you have to become the leaders.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.920
And the impression should be on people that

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.200
you are people who are smart at it,

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.960
you know the job, you know how to speak, how to present Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.240
and do it in a way that is congenial, loving, affectionate,

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.760
and not like a volcanic stuff also.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.040
Sometimes, you see people get very volcanic with others, that also.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.240
With complete poise

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.960
and self-control, with self-control.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.960
This is only achieved through self-discipline.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.320
You must discipline yourself.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.320
And do not waste yourself, must have self-esteem.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.240
This is one of the biggest lacking in Sahaja Yoga today.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.120
There's no impression on people.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.880
And this is what one has to do in your dressing up,

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.840
how you talk to people, how you behave

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.440
That's very important in the outside.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.280
But inside this, there is all the time

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.760
you harp upon it, "Oh I can't do it.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.320
This is not for me. This much I can do."

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.640
Then you have not been kind to yourself and to anyone.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.960
So come up to it. I would say everybody must come up to it.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.840
And forget those days of

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.320
taking to drugs and sitting down.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.960
Whom are you going to impress with the drugs, tell Me.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.800
The another thing that impresses people

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.600
is hypocrisy which we cannot take.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.400
If you are a hypocrite, you see, wear a bhagwan dress,

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.760
have a chillum in the hand and go round,

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.680
and you say "Oh, I was chosen by God. Go and think."

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.640
That way impresses - that you can't do.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.240
So the whole thing is, both the things, the Nabhis are

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.800
for our well-being

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.720
which is manifested outside as well.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.960
I mean it's all right. We should have a good hotel to live in.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.440
All right, given.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.200
Have you got the eliteness of living in a hotel?

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.960
Let's see. But put a question to yourself.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.440
You asked for a hotel, you've got a hotel, all right.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.400
Have you got that eliteness or how are you behaving?

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.120
Just think of it. In this hotel, supposing,

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.840
somebody has to live, for example,

00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.320
XYZ. He will have a particular type of eliteness.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.440
Isn't it? Even sometimes I find the bags you carry

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.680
are so dirty, filthy, dented, holes in it.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.720
Somebody might think that somebody is running away from this hotel,

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.640
something he's taking out.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.880
The rags and things should be given up and thrown away.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.640
Now I hope there is one word like "throw",

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.600
which is not used.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.800
I'm sitting down, I've never come up to see anything.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.680
But the "throw" part of it is necessary.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.800
Throw away all nonsensical things like rags,

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.320
and other things which you think is very good looking,

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.800
but it's not, please throw it away.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.960
See, for example, some of sweaters,

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.680
and blankets and things that people carry,

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.080
are horrible. Color should be smart,

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.040
everything should be smart.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.040
You know you should not look a ragged person.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.560
I mean how are you in Raja Lakshmi state?

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.640
One has to see it's a Raja Lakshmi standing.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.960
You see, there is no need

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.720
to show that we are beggars.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.960
That's only, only good for the people who are hypocrites, not for us.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.080
You see, beggars are normally not beggars.

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.680
They are hypocrites. So they beg.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.240
They earn money. In India you'll be surprised, some of the beggars

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.640
have got huge, big buildings on Marine Drive. They own it.

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.560
And still their profession is begging.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.640
So they are not really beggars. They are hypocrites you see.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.320
They make money like that.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.560
So why should we be dressed up like that?

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.120
Moreover if you dress up like that, the other side will follow

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.200
and that is the bhoot.

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.880
That will sit on you.

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.040
Because they want bhootish people to look at.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.280
They won't sit on a [neat] person, who is properly dressed,

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.120
who has got properly

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.680
done his hair and who is taking bath and all that.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.320
They like filth, they like dirt, they like dirty smell,

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.760
and if you have all these things in you,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.120
they will be just on top of your head walking with you,

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.880
wherever you'll go. They like such things. You see, like,

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.280
you put something filthy,

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.120
you will find all the flies come down there.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.560
You see, simple things.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.760
Anything you put filthy

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.960
there will be all the worms getting inside that.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.640
It's like that.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.080
So the way you are that's how it works.

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.160
So for your Raja Lakshmi,

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.960
for your Gruha Lakshmi,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.760
it is important that you should have

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.440
self-control in your behavior, how you talk.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.800
When you talk, if you talk like a

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.000
cheap person,

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:15.840
or like a

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.640
a person who is doused with something,

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.960
then nobody is going to be impressed.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.960
How you behave is very important,

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.120
how you sit, how you talk.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.960
The other day, Neema, you see, they asked Neema to speak

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.680
and Neema has never spoken, she's quite nervous.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.240
But Gregoire said, "You should tell us about our defect".

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.360
And she said really somemething very sensible.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.560
She said that, "I have so many defects and we Indians all have defects

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.160
but what I find about you people is that

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.760
that before Mother when you behave,

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.040
the protocol is missing.

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.720
You take Her for granted. 'It's all right, She's Mahamaya,' and all that",

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.040
but there also what she said, that "For us it's just like

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.960
a setting we had that 'This is the Goddess,'

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.400
the tradition of Goddess is there.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.440
And we found Her, is there like a diamond, we put Her in the set.

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.800
So it's just done, we have no problem.

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.240
But sometimes I find the way people walk before Her

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.280
just like horses, the way they talk,

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.960
and all those things are surprising. Their behavior is surprising.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.760
I can't understand how you can do it when you know

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.080
She's the Goddess, of course She is."

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.120
So, in that case,

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.680
I would say once this Raja Lakshmi business comes up,

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.280
then you will understand the respect.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.840
Because once you respect yourself, you start respecting others also.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.080
And that you are all saints,

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.720
you have to respect each other, in the same way.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.840
You should really, call each other, I mean,

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.680
if it is in Hindi language I would say

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.840
you should call "thou" because we say it to elder people, like that.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.240
"Please be seated, please be," it's a great respect of people.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.760
It will impress others. Instead of that, in the program,

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.240
you find somebody slapping each other, holding each other's

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.240
hair and shouting. What will they think, what saints,

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.400
from where these new types of saints have come?

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.880
Saints have to respect each other.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.800
They come to your house,

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.960
you offer them some nice seat to sit down.

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.160
You must see how the saints respect the saints.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:16.600
That respect should be there among yourselves, the oneness,

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.960
the understanding, is ... Without respect,

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.040
you cannot have any rapport.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.960
And to have a rapport,

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.400
there should be equal level

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.720
of understanding, that as I want respect others must be respected.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.680
You should be respectful and to be respected.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.920
Both things should be done. This is the Lakshmi staying here.

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.360
And today now, the light,

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.720
the light is there, light is a very important thing.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.680
From the very beginning you see, when a man discovered

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.400
the fire,

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.960
the fire was used in the Gruha Lakshmi state,

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.880
where the food was cooked and the fire cooked the food,

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.720
and was used, you see, the warmth of the Mother you see,

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.960
was shown through that heart that we use in the house,

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:10.320
to warm up her children, to give them food and all that, that state.

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.440
Then it became an, say, in any collective thing,

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.880
which is expressed as light, you see.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.160
If you have to celebrate, say, your Republic Day

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.600
or your Independence Day, we put the lights on.

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.560
Or we have fireworks you see.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.080
To express ourselves, then that one

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.680
is in the Raja Lakshmi. Now the Mahalakshmi.

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.400
Mahalakshmi is the evolutionary state.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.040
In the evolutionary state,

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.920
when the evolutionary state starts

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.680
then the Mahalakshmi starts asserting Herself,

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.160
and that comes when your well-being is established within you.

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.880
I mean if you are still worried as to how to get

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.960
a cup of tea for yourself, you cannot get to Mahalakshmi state.

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.000
So once that is little bit established

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.080
and you feel that peace within yourself,

00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.120
and that dignity then the Mahalakshmi power starts acting on you.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.800
And the Mahalakshmi power is that it really makes you the light.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.720
You have now become the light.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.120
You don't have to have any light. You are the light.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:24.160
When you go anywhere, when people see you

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.720
they take guidance from you. They use you as a torch

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.920
which guides them.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.760
They will come and consult you and ask you how to go.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.080
It is you who are the light.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.960
So this is what it is.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.040
One has to know that Mahalakshmi tattwa is represented here

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.160
as the light. And you see these lights can enlighten.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.360
Even a small light how it reacts and how it shows.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.800
And now you have become the light.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.600
Even this light can do it. You see I put My hand to it

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.840
and it recognizes and moves there.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.040
Because it is now enlightened.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.760
It is put before the photograph, it's enlightened, it works that way.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.440
Now what about you? You are the light now.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.440
You are the Diwali, for God.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.000
Diwali means the, the rows of light.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.960
So you are going

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.200
to make this beautiful mansion of God

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.560
full of Diwali light.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.120
You have entered into the kingdom of God

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.160
and you have to enlighten.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.720
So you are the decoration of God,

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.720
on one side,

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.720
you are the glory of God,

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.960
and also on the other side you are the guide.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.080
Guidelines, you are like the torches. You can say you are

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.560
like the

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.880
what you call them, which are used by ships also.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.000
Lighthouse.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:57.960
Lighthouse?

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.960
Beacon.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.560
You have to become lighthouses,

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.800
so that people see you. You stand out, and light the sea.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.640
Like that you have to be.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.800
And for that you have to have self-discipline.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.320
Put your will power, put it.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.280
The will power. Put it down, "How can I not do it?"

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.600
Now in this place I am going to start

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.960
within say two, three days, after Diwali,

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.800
a morning session, say about,

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.960
we can start about five o'clock every morning,

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.800
or five thirty every morning.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.160
You have to have your bath before coming here.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.680
Say five thirty, or five o'clock, will that be all right?

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.680
Your Mother gets up at four thirty whatever may happen.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.120
You have to change your habits. You have to.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.320
Get up in the morning. You know by

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.160
getting up in the morning you

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.960
finish off so much of work.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.920
Because in the night what do you do? Just gossip, waste your time.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.080
But if you say that, "Tonight let me sleep late

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.960
and tomorrow I'll get up early," you'll never.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.040
First get up early then you'll sleep early.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.960
The other way around. You see, you have to see your mind how it works.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.640
So get up in the morning,

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.960
have your bath and sit down for meditation.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.040
It's quite a warm room. So have your nice hot bath,

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.120
sit down for your meditation for about an hour or so, meditate.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.240
You'll feel so nice. After some time

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.960
you cannot sleep after four thirty.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.080
Now look at my system, I mean whether I am in America,

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.800
or whether I am in India, I get up at four thirty.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.040
How do I manage?

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.360
I have no watch or thing like that, I just get up at four thirty.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.960
I have tuned Myself to the sun.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.960
You are tuned more to the moon.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.680
I've tuned Myself to the sun.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.840
When the sun comes at this angle I have to get up

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.680
because that is the time the vibrations start to flow,

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.360
all over the world.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.400
At four thirty in the morning all these vibrations

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.080
the best time, flow in the purest form.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.600
That's why all the seers get up very early in the morning,

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.680
have their bath,

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.320
and sit down for meditation. It's too much I know,

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.040
specially for Englishmen.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.760
But you have to train up yourself.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.720
You will do it, you will like it, if you do it like a festival.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.240
See today is a festival day, let us get up and have a nice bath,

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.800
and have a nice soap you see,

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.960
perfumed one and nice things and ... you'll enjoy.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.240
Bath should be a ritual.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.240
But should not be all the time.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.040
Because I see they are just sitting there quite happy.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.920
Like Indians also, they bathe too much, that is not necessary.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.560
Too much not, but one.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.320
And then if you sit at home

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.960
for about an hour or so, the house is lighted.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.120
I could get this place lighted in the morning

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.400
you come here, you will be amazed

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.240
that if you develop this habit

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.080
you can do such a lot,

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.960
because in the evening you are tired, you cannot do many things,

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.120
and you are absolutely fade down you see.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.760
So you'll sleep early.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.720
And this is the English thing, "early to bed and early to rise".

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.680
Not Indian, is it?

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.280
And that's what we have to do.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.440
And you'll be amazed you'll do thousand and one things,

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.600
thousand and one things if you get up early in the morning.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.000
So we are going to try that after Diwali.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.560
I'm going to announce. Those who can try with Me, can do it.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.120
And I used to sleep sometimes at two o'clock,

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.880
two thirty, mostly at two,

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.360
and get up at four thirty, finish My bath.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.000
Everybody was still sleeping and I didn't want to disturb them.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.840
Then at about eight o'clock, I would say,

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.160
"Now, will you please get up?"

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.960
Once Gregoire, you see, it was the day he had to leave,

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.920
he was saying, "Oh, it's already two o'clock.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.040
There are only three hours."

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.880
I said, "Gregoire, you better sleep now.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.640
Worrying about it you won't sleep, so better sleep."

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.280
"How, how will I wake up, what will happen?"

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.960
At five o'clock I just said, "Now." I got up four thirty.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.960
Five o'clock, "Five o'clock!"

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.880
And they all got up.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.280
Ask him.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.960
And it's so, it's very easy to do it, you see. It's very easy.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.200
You did not sleep like Me till two o'clock.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.920
Then, but if I sleep [a bit],

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.960
then in the daytime I sleep for an hour or so.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.280
I make up. But then you will feel sleepy,

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.560
go off to sleep. In the night it's a waste of time to keep awake.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.280
It's really waste.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.640
What do you see? These dirty pictures in the TV. What else?

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.960
After nine o'clock is there anything worth seeing?

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.760
Nine thirty, ten at the most.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.680
Then all filth is there.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.400
You'll feel healthier, you'll be much better off.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.560
Harry has improved very much with this kind of a thing.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.040
And morning time you don't think much, you really meditate.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.400
it's a very good thing.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.320
So just I am leaving one thing for your

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.400
understanding, that let us work it out,

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.960
something out of our self discipline.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.720
It's very important. See the ego doesn't allow you

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.920
to have a discipline. He'll say, "Ah, what's wrong?"

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.120
That's the way we have to put our ego down.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.960
And self discipline will give you

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.240
freely, I tell you, self-control.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.640
Self-control is very important

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.400
and that self-control

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.960
is only possible if you really know how to

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.840
develop it, inculcate it and become yourself.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.240
It's a beautiful

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.000
analogy given in Katha, Katha Upanishad,

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.440
that, you see, the body is like a chariot,

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.880
it says, body is like a chariot.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.680
And the charioteer

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.160
is the buddhi,

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.560
and the Spirit is the master.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.280
And the charioteer is the buddhi, is the intellect.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.760
Buddhi is better word than intellect is, you see.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.640
I mean you can call the

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.120
wisdom, wisdom.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.400
Now the senses are like the horses.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.160
Senses are like the horses,

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.040
they are running here or there, hither, thither and all that.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.000
And the controlling of it, the reigns,

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.560
are in the hand of the buddhi, the char..., in the person

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.040
who is handling it, the charioteer,

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.440
is the wisdom or the intellect within us.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.560
The intellect has to control the senses.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.960
And the reigns are to be controlled.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.960
Now when you allow these

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.240
senses to go wherever it likes you see

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.960
and you do not control it,

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.560
then you are neither here nor there.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.960
You say, "I know, I know, I know."

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.040
What part knows, what part goes wrong,

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.600
where are you? And then why are you doing it?

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.760
"I know I should have been, I know it's very bad, I know."

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.840
Why? If you know, it should be your knowledge,

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.080
it should be your complete

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.960
being of that kind. If you know it's done.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.240
Knowledge should be one with your behavior.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.840
I mean, I know this is white.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.040
All right, then I treat it like white. Or do I treat it like black?

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.040
If I know, this is, this is the fire, I don't put my hand there.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.840
I say, "I know it is fire," do I put hand there?

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.960
So to control our sense organs,

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.240
we have to have our buddhi, our

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.720
mind, quite intact.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.160
and put in the hands of the Self,

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.720
where "I" doesn't remember: "I do it, I, I," all that.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.960
Spirit doesn't like it.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.320
You have to have a very disciplined mind which

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.800
should improve your method, of everything, of talking,

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.920
doing things. I mean you must improve,

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.560
all the time you have to improve.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.240
If you are reconciled with yourself then it's finished.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.200
Then the whole thing is settled down.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.960
So that's how you progress

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.920
and you'll go better and better with it.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.160
And today's day is a very great day for us because

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.120
the saints are celebrating Diwali.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.800
I am celebrating My Diwali enlightening light in your hearts,

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.240
that you enjoy your own joy and your own beauty,

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.200
that you are now the Spirit.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.960
Enjoy it, that you are that.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.880
Now you are in the kingdom of God, no doubt.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.320
I mean you, even if you don't do anything anymore,

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.680
you'll be all right there.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.960
But you should not take it for granted.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.600
You have to come forward because your Mother

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.440
needs your help. You have stand up,

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.400
you have to rise, you have to come up,

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.560
you have to become the leaders of tomorrow.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.160
You have to work it out and not just be talkers and

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.960
thinking big and saying big, big things,

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.240
and if, even if I ask you to wash a spoon you cannot do it.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.640
What's the use?

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.440
So you are tomorrow's citizens,

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.920
you are the ones who are going to impress people.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.200
I expect you to have an understanding

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.960
about what you have to achieve.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.800
But don't sit down and plan

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.800
because planning means you will never do it.

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.080
"This is our plan: tomorrow morning, I'll get up in the morning,

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.680
I'll do my meditation and write it down in a book."

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.920
And three days you'll never get up.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.800
Because you have already written it down.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.400
You have planned it.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.680
You have planned it.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.880
The planning is done.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.000
Why should you do it actually? It's done. You've done it.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.640
In the, in the diary, it's all there.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.880
That's what planning is.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.960
Planning is: you sit down, "All right, so what should we do?".

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.600
Let's sit down. It's craziness, some people ...

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.960
Nothing happens. What happens? Everything in the planning.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.040
Who is going to revise it and see it is done?

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.960
And that's how mentally we have a satisfaction, "Oh, we've done it.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.080
All of us sat together, we had a big committee meeting."

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.960
You all talk, talk, talk,

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.040
"We decided this Mother, we have decided on this, and decided."

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.960
What have you achieved? Nothing.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.080
How is it? What have you decided?

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.960
To achieve, that is what it is. That's not planning.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.800
So you do not plan, but just get up tomorrow morning.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920
All right? Try that. Do not plan,

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.400
because planning is the one that fixes you up

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.360
not to do a thing. And that has led to this

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.640
kind of idiotic country and everywhere else.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.640
Just they plan. Plan for what?

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.840
Now is there any question?

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.160
Then we retire.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.600
We have to have now

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.960
collective understanding also that we have to do some programming,

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.200
every Saturday and Sunday I should be free

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.760
after the 24th. Saturday, Sunday if not,

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.040
we can have the meetings - after the 24th I will be quite free.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.560
But even before that you see, we can have it on Saturdays, Sundays.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.400
Now there are two Saturdays, Sundays in between.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.920
You can plan something if you want Me to go somewhere,

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.280
you want to have a meeting anywhere, or here, or if

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.960
people want to meet Me, you can do it.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.680
But we cannot get Caxton Hall on Saturdays, Sundays.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.840
I cannot do on weekdays, so get some hall where I can go there,

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.040
some school hall or something on a Saturday,

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.280
we all can meet. There are two Saturdays we can use.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.760
Or Sundays, anything that you want to.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.560
A school hall will be all right on a Sunday, Gavin.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.200
And you can advertize in the papers, about it.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.960
Now, this,

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.880
for example I am going on the 28th,

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.880
so there are two Sundays now,

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.640
where we can meet. All right?

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.120
And when I go,

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.960
and I come back, then also we can meet

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.960
on weekdays, then I can meet on weekdays.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.440
But before that I can meet, meet you

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.920
on any Saturday or Sunday.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.680
There are hardly two Saturdays, Sundays.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.760
So you arrange it, or if you want we can meet in Chelsham Road,

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.440
in the ashram.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.440
Anyway,

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.600
if you, Sahaja Yogis can meet Me, any problem,

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.800
anything you can tell Me. Now, again, we are having a puja,

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.960
in any case, on this Sunday.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.440
Sunday, 30th.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.960
Friday, Friday, Friday.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.560
Friday, going? 30th, Friday.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:58.960
What time?

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.440
All right. So next Sunday you can have a meeting, if you want to.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.120
On the next Sunday you can have a meeting.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.160
Now, what about Brighton?

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.960
How are they? What meeting are they having today?

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.760
They are having a regular program?

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.400
Yes, Mother, we are having programs on Tuesdays and Thursdays

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.240
and now we have started Fridays.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.960
Where? In the house or in the?

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.680
No, we have a meeting, public meeting every Tuesday

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.560
at Brighton Hall, and we are also starting

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.840
another public meeting on Fridays.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.760
And we have a meeting at a house on Thursdays.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.240
I would suggest that

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.880
public meetings, whatever you people have,

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.760
should be on a Saturday and a Sunday.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.720
Would be better if you can get a hall.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.800
Because you see, weekdays we have programs here.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.960
For the time being it's all right because Saturday, Sunday

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.760
now we'll be having, these two Saturdays, Sundays. But normally,

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.680
you know if Friday is a puja and all, if you have a meeting,

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.200
you should consult people here also,

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.680
because then they would like to come for the puja, no?

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.960
This Friday, you all should come for a puja.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.720
All right?

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.320
We can have some music.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.400
Mother, what time we will have the program on Friday?

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.720
What time we will have the puja on Friday?

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.960
puja we should start about

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.640
about, it has to be evening time.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.960
Whatever time suits you people. But after that,

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.880
I mean, you have to have some music, or something we can have.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.160
After that.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.680
Seven o'clock? Seven.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.960
Seven is all right. Because all of you will be working.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.600
You can even have it on Saturday if you like, whatever you say.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.080
Will that suit people, seven o'clock, Friday?

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.000
Or it will be tiring?

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.440
We get on the right.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.800
Put your left to the right, you see, always.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.080
Put your left to the right, you won't be tired.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.000
Because you think too much, you see.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.560
That's why. Put left to the right, hundred and eight times.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.600
All the time tired.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.320
Left to the right. Good for your heart, good for all these.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.680
Good, see. Thinking is much better.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.200
Agnyas.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.840
Now I would like to see your dear husband,

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.160
tomorrow, if he can come and see Me.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.920
Is he here? Cooley? Where are you?

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.400
You come and see Me tomorrow, all right?

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.160
You and, where is ... Djamel has come?

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.320
No, Mother.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.960
All right, Djamel, I'll talk to him but

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.800
in any case you come and see Me tomorrow.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.960
And tell Kay to come and see Me tomorrow.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.760
Is she coming tomorrow morning?

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.560
She arrives tomorrow morning.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.560
All right. Let her come in the evening tomorrow and see Me.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.600
All right? Now who else wants to see Me personally?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.440
Can come tomorrow morning.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:10.960
At what time, Mother?

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.680
What time you can come?

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.760
I'm working.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:19.160
What time you'll be over? What time?

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.160
Near five.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.960
All right, then about five thirty.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.960
I'll be here. Or you send Me word,

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.160
with the servant. Five thirty I'll be here.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.800
Those who want to see Me

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.920
in the morning, can come here in the morning. All right?

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.840
Anybody who wants to see Me. Magda, you want to see Me?

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.720
Any time morning, you can come. I'm here.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.800
Gavin, are you all right now?

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.600
[TO AN END?]

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.880
Better?

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.360
How are you, Jane?

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.040
Are you all right?

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.200
Liver will be all right with this, see. Now better?

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.400
Thinking is better now.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.920
Yes.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.240
You put from right to left.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.240
You and Felicity. Felicity right to left.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.320
Put your right to left.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.240
Do it hundred and eight times. And don't think. Watch Me.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.640
Don't think.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.800
Good.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.200
Now inform all the people, in Cambridge, everywhere, you see.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.040
And then what we can do is to,

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.280
I can stay over and next day, or maybe I'll go Saturday.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.440
These people stay over there.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.760
Then I can talk to them on Saturday.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.880
So if any personal problems are there we can solve it out.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.800
Or else,

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.960
if you have the puja on Saturday evening it would be better, I think.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.800
Chhaya, everybody can come on Saturday.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.960
And then Sunday, you see. Let us have it on Saturday evening.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.920
Which date is Saturday?

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.280
31-st.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.840
It will be all right.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:06.960
31-st, yes.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080
31st, you see.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.720
Halloween.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.560
End of week.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.040
Halloween, yes.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.960
Halloween, Mother, it's a, it's a festival

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:19.960
of doubtful origin.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.040
It's a fest, it's a fest,

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.200
Halloween is an abbreviation for the term "Hallow's Eve",

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.400
because November the first is supposed to be All Saints' Day

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.400
November the first, so the last day of October is Hallow's eve.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.960
It's called Hallow e'en. It's supposed to be the night when

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.720
all the demons and witches fly through the sky on broomsticks.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.960
Things like that, Mother. When all the spirits take to the sky

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.800
on the night of Halloween. That's Saturday night.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.960
Then we should do it on a Sunday then.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.680
The children dress up Mother, and dress up as spirits and

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.040
ghosts and they carry lanterns.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:00.960
Witches.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:01.960
Very bad.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.000
Witches, too.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.040
It's reputed to be a night when the spirits,

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.680
when the dead come out and ...

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.120
Then supposing... So we'll have it on a Sunday then?

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.640
Shall we do it on Sunday?

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.360
I would not like to do that day.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.280
Sunday, Sunday is reputed to be All Saints' Day, Mother,

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.360
the day of all the saints, November the first.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.760
That's good. It's called All Saints' Day.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.840
That's a good day, then we'll have All Saints' Day

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.960
plus Diwali day.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.120
Saints' day. It's good. We'll have it on Sunday, all right?

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.360
So Sunday we can have the puja.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.360
I mean ...

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.600
We have to have puja then,

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.720
in the morning then, we can have morning puja,

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:39.640
and then I can stay over and in the evening we can light

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.040
the lights and all that and have some fireworks and things.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.920
Fireworks?

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.680
And we can have the music.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.160
So whole of Sunday we can spend together, there.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.960
All right? Keep it Sunday.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.440
Sunday I'll be there. Sunday.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.400
What time for the puja, Mother?

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.840
Then, Sunday should be about, we should start at ten,

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.960
you see, because we have sufficient time then.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:04.160
Ten o'clock will that be all right, for all of you?

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.560
What time will you get up Sunday?

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.000
Four thirty, Mother.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.240
It's so simple.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.800
You know, I don't know why people find it so difficult.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.320
It's just a matter of self-discipline.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.120
Just a matter.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.640
I know everybody has this problem but ...

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.200
Even Indians have now, young people have this problem.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.880
They are taking up from you people.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.640
They are becoming now more westernized and

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.960
they can't get up anytime.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.280
But even, you see, my husband, he cannot sleep after six.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.440
We were brought up like that I think, our generation,

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.880
was brought up like that.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.560
A lot of self-discipline because we were born at the time

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.000
where we needed our independence you see. So we had to

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.000
become like military people, you know.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.040
We had to really stick on to things.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.880
So we are very well disciplined that way.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.840
So it's a good day, Sunday, we'll have it, on Saints' Day.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.800
All right? And this, business of this,

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.960
witches and all that should be finished. It's all nonsense.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.640
They are not to be taken so easily.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:18.960
This must just come from since long I'm sure in this country when

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.280
people were indulging into nonsensical things.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.960
You see, they were barbaric people.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.600
Barbaric people always go to these things, you see.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.080
They must have done it and still that is continuing.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.200
Halloween becomes because of All Saints' Day

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.400
the idea that all the spirits are frightened

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.200
because of the next day.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.600
Then, this is like Naraka Chaturdashi we have.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.400
That is the day all the devils are put in the Naraka.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.040
It's done, only it's done, yesterday was the day.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.560
This is a bad week for bhoots, Mother.

01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:58.960
But that's why Diwali.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.160
That's why the light.

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:02.920
That's why you have to have light.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.880
After the fourteenth day, then the fifteenth day

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.240
they celebrate Diwali.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.320
Fifteenth day, that is the darkest night.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.120
Which night is that, Mother?

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.320
That is tonight.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.280
That is the darkest night.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.680
And then tomorrow is the day

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.840
that is the first day, you see.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.040
It's celebrated as the New Year for many people.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.960
Not in Maharashtra, they celebrate from My own dynasty that

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.200
they do it. But in north they celebrate first day, tomorrow.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.160
And the second day is the brothers' day,

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.080
where the brothers and sisters tie the ...,

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.120
that we can do also in the puja,

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.680
the brothers and sisters, they tie the thing.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.560
Where is your husband? He has not come?

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.960
He's not well, Mother.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.000
What's the matter?

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.600
The muscles in his back have ...

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.400
When did it happen?

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.840
... turned too much and he's flat on his back and can't move.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.960
When did this happen?

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.960
The day before yesterday.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.880
I know why.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.960
Tell him not to use his hands too much.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.680
He was trying to shut a window when it happened.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.920
Tell him that. I came to know about it.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.200
And I knew it was going to act that way.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.640
All right? Tell him not to use his hands.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:16.320
So can I take your leave now?

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.640
May God bless you.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.840
Happy Diwali to you all.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.960
I wish I could prepare something sweet for you

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.960
but in this place I don't know what to do.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.960
How are you now? Are you better?

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:33.960
You.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.200
Put right to the left. Right to the left.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.960
How you will go alone?

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.080
What?

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.960
He is not coming?

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.360
Why?

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.600
I am thinking...

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:10.960
I will go with someone else.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.360
Nobody will go on that time.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.360
If you go earlier then fine.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.000
Will you go earlier?

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.840
Our servant will go. Do you want to go with him?

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.080
With Saturday's flight.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.360
But it's quite early, isn't it?

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.960
Douglas, you don't want to go now, to India?

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.920
Here I am,  Mother. No, I'm not really able to take time off from work,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.280
you see, I think it's ...

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.880
I don't think it's right that I should take time off now.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.960
She has to go alone, she ...

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.240
I think perhaps she can go with Kay.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.760
Kay is not coming now.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.840
Kay has given up her job?

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.400
I think it's worked out in a slightly different way Mother,

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.000
because she has gone to Berlin

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.360
and I think they would let her take her job back until Christmas.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.280
Anyway, I'll, first of all I'll see what the situation with Kay is.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.040
Why do you feel so frightened? Are you crying?

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.360
She is feeling afraid to go alone.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.960
Oh, no, I wouldn't like for her to go alone.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.360
It's all right, nothing will happen.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.880
There is nothing to fear, someone will come to pick you up there.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.320
You have a direct flight to Mumbai.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.960
Air India it's a direct flight.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.160
You see and she knows Bombay very well. This is fine.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.920
Nothing will happen, you should go for marriage.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.080
Her father would meet her there as well.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.400
You see, everybody will be there.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.960
Oh, yes, she may go. I mean that she...

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.200
But she wants you to go.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.560
She doesn't want to leave you. I think she is crying for that.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:47.000
Not for him. My father will be upset.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.400
You know, it's her father will be upset I think.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.880
But something, I'm sure, something will work out.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.960
But how can he come? Already he has lost his one job.

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.640
Having one job lost, now should he lose his second job?

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.960
From such a long distance, everybody cannot come.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.960
Isn't it? You should tell your father.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.280
He will be upset a bit, I agree, but he will understand.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:13.560
This time she was pregnant so...

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.360
Did she delivered?

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.240
Why should she lift vacuum cleaner?

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.240
Why are you working like a horse, here?

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.160
You see, women should not become horses.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.440
All right?

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.960
Don't do like that again. Once you start, you will get the habit of that.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.200
Thank you.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.960
Thank you very much.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.360
Lakshmi and Ganesha.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.200
Good.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.640
Happy Diwali from U.K. Mother.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.120
What's that?

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.320
See, from everybody. From everybody, Mother.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.960
Sweet?

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.040
No, no, no.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.800
What is it? Mappin and Webb.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.200
What is that?

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.240
Nothing expensive I hope.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.960
Mappin and Webb, you know ...

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.840
You can't do that. It's too much, it's too much.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.400
It's from all of us.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.720
But it's too much.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.640
No, Mother, [that's the fake one].

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.840
Oh God, for Lakshmi?

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.560
I would like to wear this now.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.120
Can you take it out?

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.600
Be careful, be careful.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.040
What he is trying to say that be careful.

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.160
Thank you.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.880
[You have served?]  SY: Yes.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.880
This is Bombay halwa.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.640
May God bless you.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.680
May God bless you.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.640
Would you like me to help You?

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.800
I think I can manage.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.960
Are you going? Good, thank you.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.320
Looking nice?

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.880
Beautiful, very beautiful.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.120
Thank you very much.

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:18.960
You shouldn't do all these things

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.600
otherwise I'll be considered as other gurus.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.960
They are from Chelsham Road, Mother.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.960
Thank you. Now, these flowers must be put,

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.720
[I would say that] you have just to put them somewhere else.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:32.800
Yes, Mother.

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.680
Thank you very much, thank you. It's very kind of you.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.960
But why go to Mappin and Webb? They are very expensive people.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.840
We felt the vibrations, Mother. Yes, very good vibrations.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.160
Yes, I know, it is, o.k..

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.080
I have so many chains, I've never worn a chain all My life.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.600
This would be a good idea. You have really chained Me.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.720
Chained with your love.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.240
We've been chained to Your heart.

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:39.400
It's better now? Did you see?

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.960
Very much, Mother, yes, yes.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.680
Did you see it?

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.360

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.880
She wants to sit there?

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.360
[Or she goes to Auriel]]?

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.440
All right, come and say "Happy Diwali" to Mr. Shrivastava. Come.
