1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:14,407
My only, if I have any desire, is that:

2
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:22,367
‘Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva’.

3
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:33,174
How great he is, how detached he is, detached, absolutely detached.

4
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:40,488
He lives with bones and things like that.

5
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:44,972
He is not bothered about where he is, what he lives with,

6
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:48,246
what he has, nothing.

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,569
So detached, and we should be detached like that.¶

8
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,770
At the same time, we should be very loving like him,

9
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,246
extremely loving.

10
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:06,932
How his heart is full of love for others,

11
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:09,932
how he looks after others.

12
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:16,609
I am warning you, because I know you all love me very much,

13
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,012
but you should also love each other,

14
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:23,133
you should have a loving heart,

15
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:28,609
and have satisfaction in loving others.

16
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,690
If you could develop that, your height will grow,

17
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,770
your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow.

18
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:44,214
It’s alright, the Goddess gives you the shraddha, alright,

19
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:48,528
but the depth in shraddha,

20
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,367
in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don’t know,

21
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:58,690
but in Marathi they call it dyas.

22
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:05,327
Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love,

23
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:08,569
enjoying that love – then you don’t want anything.

24
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,286
What do you want? You’ve got everything.

25
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:15,891
So what do you want now?

26
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:24,528
Just like the greatness of Shri Mahadeva.

27
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:30,367
He’s so great that he’s detached.

28
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:34,286
What does he want? I mean nothing is greater than him,

29
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:38,690
nothing is more important than him. Then what does he want?

30
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:44,528
He doesn’t want anything. That’s why he’s detached.

31
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:50,133
This detachment you have to develop.¶

32
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:56,367
But at the same time he is the Lord of all the arts,

33
00:02:56,488 --> 00:03:00,770
of the music, of the rhythm.

34
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:05,286
The other day you saw these boys were playing the rhythm.

35
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:09,012
The whole rhythm of everything he gives.

36
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:17,609
The rhythmic life that we have, we are not yet aware of it.

37
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:27,367
See a child is born exactly after nine months and so-many days.

38
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:30,528
Who keeps this rhythm?

39
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:36,448
Then we get, say, certain flowers at such-and-such time,

40
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:42,932
then we get in the nature all kinds of seasons.

41
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,327
Who keeps the rhythm?

42
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:50,407
He is the one who is nothing but rhythm!

43
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:55,174
And that rhythm is kept up, in the nature,

44
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:58,528
in everything there is a rhythm.

45
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:05,609
And a rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart!

46
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:09,367
It’s like an ocean.¶

47
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:14,690
You get just that rhythm disturbed immediately if you

48
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:20,174
find somebody who is being very cruel, very bad and all that.

49
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:28,811
But in a smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake,

50
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:33,569
there is no ripple at all, it is just love.

51
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,851
And then at that time, if the rhythm,

52
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:42,093
the silent rhythm of that heart is broken,

53
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:45,327
then Shiva takes charge.

54
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:52,811
So one has to have a complete sense of the rhythm of time,

55
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:58,174
rhythm of nature, rhythm of everything.

56
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:01,649
People don’t know even the names of the flowers.

57
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,851
They don’t know what these flowers are,

58
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,811
what time they come up;

59
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:14,730
they have no idea what is the rhythm of their ‘living’

60
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,811
– nobody’s bothered.¶

61
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:22,053
All over, if you see, there is seasons and things.

62
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:28,569
So all the rhythm, like his play, with tabla or pakwaj

63
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:36,569
on which he played all the beautiful tunes of all the seasons.

64
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,488
And that’s how the nature flourishes

65
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:45,367
and comes up and then subsides.¶

66
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:48,448
We do not see that point.

67
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:52,528
We are just bothered about ourselves.

68
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:54,972
Like I’ll ask “How are you?”

69
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,649
“Mother, I’ve got a headache, I’ve got a stomach trouble,

70
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,286
I have another trouble” … or everything is there.

71
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:08,770
But another one would say “Ah, I’m alright!”

72
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,528
“So, what’s the matter?”

73
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,851
“Put the world right Mamma!

74
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,367
Mother, why don’t you put the world right?”

75
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:21,246
He’s worried about others, not about himself.

76
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:27,367
And in that understanding of what one should do

77
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:31,093
to make this world happy, beautiful,

78
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:35,972
for that one has to really work hard, so called,

79
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:40,133
and in that working one thinks,

80
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:46,327
“Isn’t it our duty to make this world beautiful?

81
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,811
Isn’t it our job to make

82
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:55,053
this world rhythmic, rhyming with the Spirit?”

83
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,214
It’s our duty. We have to do it!

84
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:04,811
Not only taking Sahaja Yoga for yourself, but for others.

85
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:08,407
It’s not you are all the time worried about yourself,

86
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,133
but you are worried about others,

87
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:16,133
what’s happening in the world.

88
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:22,174
That is love! That love is spontaneous,

89
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:26,690
and when it works, it works wonders.¶

90
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,690
So this is a beautiful evening,

91
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:49,053
where we are worshipping such a great source of our ascent.

92
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:54,569
And I hope you people will understand

93
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,246
how far you are with that force,

94
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:04,448
how much are you drenched in that force,

95
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:11,093
in that rhythm of Shiva,

96
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:16,569
who, in his rhythmic way, gives you vibrations.

97
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,367
Vibrations flow in the way we live,

98
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:27,246
and that way should engulf you completely;

99
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:32,012
and you should be asked in that your ‘I-ness’

100
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:36,012
should be dissolved in that which is I bless you.

101
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,439
Thank you.¶

102
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:52,286
Today we have a Ganesha Puja, a small Ganesha Puja,

103
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,012
then Shiva Puja and then the Devi’s Puja.¶

104
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:57,488
May God Bless You
