00:15.800 --> 00:18.450
Happy Diwali.

00:27.030 --> 00:30.160
Wish you all a very happy Diwali.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.570
You saw various kinds of dances.

00:43.590 --> 00:46.170
you must try to understand one thing from them

00:46.950 --> 00:54.050
that whoever composed or spoke about them

00:54.260 --> 00:57.220
Everyone spoke of one and the same thing.

00:57.770 --> 01:01.060
The most important thing that everyone said

01:02.430 --> 01:05.130
was 'God is one'.

01:08.060 --> 01:12.230


01:12.250 --> 01:14.460
'God is one'.

01:15.690 --> 01:19.200
There is no dispute amongst them.

01:20.310 --> 01:25.670
They incarnate on Earth in order to destroy the evil

01:25.730 --> 01:29.700
and to condemn the evil doers.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.500
That is happening everywhere.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.530
I find everywhere

01:38.530 --> 01:46.000
the evil people are getting exposed.

01:47.020 --> 01:50.740
Now, it is your duty also

01:51.230 --> 01:54.700
to identify them who are evil,

01:54.830 --> 01:59.930
working against the will of God.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.750
Those Who go to any extreme for the sake of money.

02:03.930 --> 02:09.000
They  will all go to hell.

02:10.030 --> 02:16.730
We really do not know how many types of hells exist.

02:17.430 --> 02:22.500
The environment or the place where you are sitting now

02:24.200 --> 02:26.400
is far beyond those hells.

02:27.460 --> 02:30.030
It has no connection with the hell at all.

02:31.500 --> 02:37.040
But, in spite of your being at this place

02:37.270 --> 02:42.190
if you continue commiting sins and practice all sorts of wrong things,

02:42.190 --> 02:44.900
then  you could go to hell too.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.930
There are various kinds of hell

02:50.150 --> 02:54.760
and nice arrangements are there to go to those hells.

02:55.030 --> 02:58.230
Because,those who are supposed to go hell

02:58.530 --> 03:01.600
can never even realize where are they going.

03:02.930 --> 03:08.600
While those who are saved,they go to the heaven.

03:10.330 --> 03:14.250
So, sitting at earth level nobody can know

03:14.560 --> 03:17.380
that "I'll have to go to hell',

03:17.650 --> 03:21.900
or by commiting wrong things, 'I'll  go to hell'.

03:22.350 --> 03:26.110
The meaning of 'Diwali' itself is :

03:26.380 --> 03:29.650
like the lamps lit outside,

03:29.700 --> 03:33.830
should be lit within you.

03:34.990 --> 03:45.000
You must also realize that you are

03:45.060 --> 03:48.420
like the lights in this world of darkness.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.640
You are the lamps and you're the lights. You have to emit the light.

03:51.860 --> 03:55.580
But, if the same is not fully enlightened from within,

03:56.160 --> 03:59.060
then how can you emit the light?

03:59.070 --> 04:01.660
You must also think  over it.

04:01.710 --> 04:04.460
That is why in the first place, the Sahaja Yogis

04:05.400 --> 04:10.030
should know that the light is fully established within.

04:11.930 --> 04:14.460
Possibly that was the purpose

04:15.130 --> 04:18.030
for which we had to come to this world.

04:18.530 --> 04:22.900
Until Jesus Christ no one ever spoke on these subjects.

04:23.260 --> 04:27.010
He incarnated at the Agnya Chakra level

04:27.600 --> 04:37.430
and showed the world that He did not have any ego within Him.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.100
He was the son of the God,

04:40.130 --> 04:42.970
yet He had no ego.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.600
Those who came before Him

04:46.260 --> 04:49.960
spoke but very little.

04:50.460 --> 04:57.400
Christ came and wanted that our Agnya chakra should become all right.

04:59.960 --> 05:03.300
Incidentally that Agnya chakra catches too much in your Delhi.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.260
What could be the reason for it?

05:10.260 --> 05:12.400
At the first place the English people came here to rule

05:14.430 --> 05:17.630
and then Englishmen taught us arrogancy.

05:20.660 --> 05:24.160
They can easily be made out from your conversations.

05:25.060 --> 05:26.890
I have seen those days also

05:26.890 --> 05:30.160
when our country was dependent.

05:31.630 --> 05:36.160
But, you've come out of that dependency.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.660
Now there is 'swatantrata'.

05:39.530 --> 05:42.260
And what is 'swatantranta'  supposed to be?  Is to know the 'Swa'

05:42.440 --> 05:44.900
('ownself') and whoever has known his 'Self',

05:45.890 --> 05:48.150
Knows the 'tantra' (system) of the 'Self'.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.070


05:50.560 --> 05:54.050
Through Sahaja Yoga you have come to know about yourself.

05:55.060 --> 05:59.630
And now you know that you are the 'tantra'.

06:01.300 --> 06:05.620
Therefore, you have to walk on the path of that 'tantra' of the 'self'.

06:06.930 --> 06:11.130
Lot of works have been done in Delhi, they are visible.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.660
Works have also been done beyond Delhi.

06:18.380 --> 06:22.710
Now, the various problems in the people here are very well known to you.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.630
I need not tell you that.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.070
But , now that you have become 'swatantra' (independent),

06:29.340 --> 06:34.040
so you must be able to judge yourself whether you possess such problems within  or not.

06:34.780 --> 06:38.310
First of all the problem is

06:38.400 --> 06:42.200
that you have your own Agnya Chakra caught up.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.700
Jesus Christ passed away. He went to the cross,

06:50.600 --> 06:54.400
yet we did not learn anything from it.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.030
On the contrary, wherever there are Christian countries,

06:58.180 --> 07:01.100
they possess tremendous ego.

07:02.330 --> 07:06.120
They had their influence on us too.

07:07.330 --> 07:11.630
But, the worst part we find here is

07:13.130 --> 07:20.380
that we donot know each other.

07:20.730 --> 07:23.640
There is quarrel everywhere,

07:23.730 --> 07:26.030
fights everywhere.

07:26.190 --> 07:29.640
There is no clarity in understanding amongst each other.

07:29.910 --> 07:35.820
So the first thing is that our minds need to be cleansed.

07:35.950 --> 07:38.860
Everything is possible in Sahaja Yoga.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.350
People can attain any position from anywhere.

07:42.700 --> 07:46.820
It is not necessary for that reason to go and sit in the Himalayas .

07:46.870 --> 07:51.160
You can do it here in this city of Delhi itself.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.230
But, if you look around,

07:53.400 --> 07:56.400
you will find egoistical people.

07:56.530 --> 07:59.130
They have their Agnya chakra severely caught up.

07:59.260 --> 08:01.430
So it is really very difficult.

08:02.260 --> 08:06.450
Now, god has given another new thing called 'cancer'.

08:06.980 --> 08:13.300
If you have cancer and  your Agnya chakra is not set all right,

08:15.500 --> 08:17.600
then it can never get cured.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.030
And there will be great trouble.

08:22.630 --> 08:24.200
That is why those who are suffering from cancer

08:25.160 --> 08:27.600
should take to Sahaja Yoga

08:28.130 --> 08:34.160
and the ego within you must be got rid of.

08:34.930 --> 08:36.700
Because, wherever there is a government,

08:37.230 --> 08:40.160
ego comes into the people.

08:41.030 --> 08:43.260
We have so many government servants here

08:45.900 --> 08:49.060
and they have a lot of ego within them.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.300
But, it is far more pronounced in the people

08:53.160 --> 08:55.900
who have come from outside. They are like the 'grand fathers'(in negative sense)

08:56.060 --> 08:58.930
to the ones here. And on top of it, they all drink alcohol.

08:59.230 --> 09:00.360
Just imagine they call themselves Christians

09:00.500 --> 09:02.560
and they all drink alcohol.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.530
Therfore by drinking alcohol, you are going against yourself only.

09:11.300 --> 09:18.230
You are blocking your own Agnya chakra.

09:19.030 --> 09:21.130
You are compltely ignoring it.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.260
The person whose Agnya chakra is cleared out

09:23.430 --> 09:26.330
he can never drink alcohol.Never ever can have alcohol.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.330
You find everywhere people drinking alcohol

09:33.260 --> 09:36.400
and neither do they have any means to control it.

09:37.130 --> 09:39.200
Because,whenever they try to overcome

09:39.900 --> 09:41.300
they start drinking even more.

09:42.160 --> 09:46.460
So, any kind of'lat'[addiction] drags us to slavery

09:46.530 --> 09:48.130
... of any kind.

09:49.900 --> 09:53.130
Now, these days here you will find addiction to chewing 'paan' (betel-leaves)

09:54.130 --> 09:56.200
and on top of it, adds tobacco into it.

09:59.300 --> 10:03.560
Just imagine. God has created you with such great love

10:04.000 --> 10:05.330
in this country,

10:06.100 --> 10:08.930
so that you could become unique from the rest of the world.

10:09.430 --> 10:12.160
It can happen... and in fact the Indians are an example of that only.

10:14.060 --> 10:18.330
But, now I find a they have developed few more obsessions,

10:20.630 --> 10:24.560
.Like...  people here prefer to'eat money'rather than eating their 'meals'.
(popular Indian proverb to denote practicing bribery).

10:27.100 --> 10:29.160
Now, for example, the road by which I arrived here

10:30.230 --> 10:33.400
was not there earlier.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.100
It shocked Me immensely to find that they have

10:37.300 --> 10:41.100
constructed a new road recently. But, none can ever claim the same to be

10:42.360 --> 10:45.260
a newly constructed one. Only the Indians can do such works..

10:45.660 --> 10:49.430
I have never seen such shameless people anywhere else in the world

10:51.400 --> 10:55.530
who could do such work. After all these are not needed.

10:56.430 --> 11:02.100
Anytime, one who is bigger than the other with riches can do such work.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.460
Therefore, today we need to acertain

11:06.700 --> 11:08.960
in the first place that we must get our Agnya set right.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.100
The greatest thing at the Agnya level is

11:12.530 --> 11:15.300
that we start thinking 'we are the best'

11:15.930 --> 11:22.500
and we believe that we can run the world,

11:22.930 --> 11:24.930
we can reform the world.

11:25.260 --> 11:26.360
When you are not all right yourself,

11:26.530 --> 11:29.030
then how can the world be set right?

11:29.300 --> 11:31.430
Well, you must have seen a number of people

11:32.460 --> 11:35.530
who respects and place you in high esteem

11:36.530 --> 11:39.100
and still do a lot of wrong things.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.900
In this country people are corrupt practising bribery [paise khatey hain].

11:44.300 --> 11:48.330
Tell Me how can god ever forgive us.

11:50.160 --> 11:55.330
The worst of all sins are stealing and taking bribe.

11:56.660 --> 11:59.000
The person who does these types of crimes,

12:00.700 --> 12:04.000
you may try anything on him ,even if the person himself may try to do anything, perform pujas,

12:04.500 --> 12:09.330
prayers, chant mantras, recite text from holy scriptures, read Namaz, pray in the name of Allah

12:10.600 --> 12:13.200
they will be of no use to him.

12:14.030 --> 12:16.600
Today is your new year.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.700
I wish you all the best.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.360
And I want you to take a resolution

12:24.100 --> 12:30.630
that from today onwards we will not utter lies. Never, ever you will utter any lies.

12:30.700 --> 12:36.660
I have been to places across the world and
learnt that Indians are branded as great liars everywhere.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.130
I do not understand why such brandings have come upon our country

12:42.260 --> 12:43.560
that our people are liars.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.900
Where there have been so many great saints and prophets,

12:47.660 --> 12:49.400
so many of them became Sufis,

12:51.660 --> 12:54.700
I wonder how people could speak up so much of lies there.

12:56.130 --> 12:57.930
So you've to promise today

12:58.230 --> 12:59.530
that you will not tell lies

13:00.130 --> 13:01.230
whatever may be the consequences.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.160
For that, you need  courage.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.000
But now that you are realized, what more of

13:09.200 --> 13:11.660
courage do you require? for that matter You'll can never lie.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.660
Only when you become like that,

13:16.160 --> 13:18.430
people will start believing,

13:18.930 --> 13:21.400
that these people are truthful.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.160
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be truthful.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.200
In whatever occupation

13:32.200 --> 13:37.260
may be in business or whatever,

13:38.100 --> 13:40.600
he may be an engineer constructing road or a doctor treating people.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.060
Nevertheless,

13:44.630 --> 13:49.360
it can be hell for you if you still lie.

13:51.460 --> 13:58.930
Now you have transformed your own self,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.500
you are realized now.

14:02.030 --> 14:05.660
So, if the realized people ever lie,

14:08.200 --> 14:12.160
then they can never achieve anything good out of it.

14:13.930 --> 14:17.700
I feel very sad when I have to hear about our country from people outside

14:18.260 --> 14:19.900
that people here (in India) are very dishonest,liars

14:20.560 --> 14:25.030
and make money (illegally).

14:25.660 --> 14:27.530
Today is your very auspicious day.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.300
Today you should all make sure

14:29.600 --> 14:32.560
that we shall never lie, whatever may come.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.460
I am a woman Myself and that too of India.

14:41.930 --> 14:44.330
I have never lied.

14:45.700 --> 14:50.560
By lying, you'll only be at a loss.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.960
By dishonesty, you'll only be at a loss.

14:59.430 --> 15:03.130
In this manner even if you try to earn a bit more money or adopt other deceitful means

15:04.260 --> 15:05.430
you will never be able to go to heaven.

15:06.930 --> 15:12.300
You can only go straight to hell.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.630
It is very important to know

15:16.160 --> 15:20.500
there is a very bad reputation prevailing about us in other countries.

15:21.330 --> 15:23.060
Why did this bad reputation happen?

15:24.100 --> 15:26.130
Because, we have such kind of people here.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.100
If you come to know that someone is dishonest, then you should form a committee

15:30.600 --> 15:37.960
for him and then question him, “Mister, what do you mean by all these”?

15:38.360 --> 15:40.460
For example, supposing there is a road

15:41.130 --> 15:43.230
that has not been constructed properly,

15:43.700 --> 15:48.100
then try to investigate how much has been spent behind it.

15:48.300 --> 15:52.260
Then watch his actions to see what is he doing.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.160
Making money by such illegal means will

15:55.460 --> 15:59.760
be spent ultimately towards drinking alcohol only, which is our enemy.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.500
Afterall,why do you want all these?

16:03.690 --> 16:06.360
You already have a very good living,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.050
but there are many countries where people are poor,

16:09.430 --> 16:12.130
But I found them to be honest.

16:13.230 --> 16:16.330
So, honesty should be the first priority

16:16.490 --> 16:18.000
that needs to be ascertained today.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.230
That we shall not commit dishonesty or

16:20.260 --> 16:22.940
ever be in the company of dishonest people.

16:23.260 --> 16:26.530
Further, if anyone commits it, then we shall expose him.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.800
Now, people often grumbles,

16:30.050 --> 16:32.160
“Mother, similar things happen here also or

16:32.300 --> 16:34.500
similarly it prevails there also.”

16:34.690 --> 16:36.360
But you are Sahaja Yogis.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.620
Who are Sahaja Yogis,by no means are inferior to a policeman

16:38.830 --> 16:42.960
or any person with a higher status.

16:43.520 --> 16:48.160
They possess great powers within them, but, all those powers come out of truth only.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.200
Truthfulness should be there.

16:53.030 --> 16:54.330
And I am very glad that

16:54.900 --> 16:57.460
a lot of Sahaja Yogis are very truthful.Really Truthful.

16:59.900 --> 17:04.160
But, we require more Sahaja Yogis now

17:05.930 --> 17:08.100
who can become truthful.

17:08.630 --> 17:10.700
Truthfulness is a very important aspect or else you could never

17:10.900 --> 17:14.900
get rid of your Agnya. The Agnya is the place where one has 'ego'.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.930
When ego develops in a person

17:21.400 --> 17:22.930
he commits any offence,

17:23.130 --> 17:27.300
any sin, criticizes, harms anyone, earns money illegally.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.630
They will all go to hell.

17:32.060 --> 17:34.200
I would like to caution you, that

17:34.430 --> 17:36.530
you should not earn money illegally.

17:37.060 --> 17:38.300
It is not that you are dying

17:38.500 --> 17:39.900
what have you achieved by earning more

17:40.130 --> 17:42.230
What are you doing?

17:42.300 --> 17:44.130
You may have acquired a few lights (bulbs) more

17:45.200 --> 17:49.960
and may have kept of a few more women around- And what more?

17:50.930 --> 17:55.360
But, when you'll go to hell, what will be your condition then?

17:56.500 --> 17:59.230
I am speaking on this topic on the day of Diwali

18:00.500 --> 18:02.200
because Diwali was celebrated

18:02.300 --> 18:06.560
when Sitaji had returned to reunite with Shri Rama.

18:10.030 --> 18:16.330
Once our character is established,then  we can not remain slaves any more?

18:17.360 --> 18:19.700
We are our own slaves only, not of others even by any means.

18:21.030 --> 18:23.360
You are not to lie for any purpose.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.160
I had been in Delhi for a very long period

18:26.360 --> 18:31.460
and I was surprised, how much the people lie here.

18:31.930 --> 18:36.400
My goodness – they aren't afraid at all .

18:37.230 --> 18:40.300
Speaking lies so blatantly

18:40.630 --> 18:46.900
probably could help him achieve something, here or

18:47.260 --> 18:50.600
even may help earn a few rupees extra.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.300
but can never go to heaven.

18:52.350 --> 18:55.160
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise  today onwards,

18:55.400 --> 18:59.860
'we neither shall ever lie nor ever support the liar .

18:59.960 --> 19:07.600
People comment about our country that we are very dishonest.

19:09.630 --> 19:12.630
I have travelled into far remote places

19:13.430 --> 19:18.900
and I found the people of Russia are  very good.

19:19.150 --> 19:21.630
They are already half-Sahaja Yogis

19:22.430 --> 19:24.330
and there are so many  Sahaja Yogis too.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.530
I was not able to go to Russia this year.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.400
I shall definitely visit next year.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.840
However, this  makes it clear that

19:33.070 --> 19:37.680
we can not handle democracy.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.900
We too should have been communist.

19:43.630 --> 19:45.960
Neither there is any stealing,trickery nor any lies spoken in those places

19:47.230 --> 19:49.260
and they all love each other very much.

19:50.030 --> 19:51.960
There is great respect for Me too.

19:53.160 --> 19:58.500
But, it needs to be understood where are we  leading to after all. (       ^-where are we heading towards?)

19:58.560 --> 20:02.000
Just for the sake of earning a few more (rupees), where are we heading?

20:02.630 --> 20:04.460
What are we going to achieve?

20:05.630 --> 20:08.930
Therefore, to begin with you must be honest.

20:10.430 --> 20:16.030
Your dishonesty  will cause trouble  to your own people.

20:16.210 --> 20:20.550
People blame India, claiming that people of this place are very  dishonest.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.900
I am ashamed to hear all this.

20:24.700 --> 20:28.300
You have had so many great saints

20:28.900 --> 20:33.330
so many great souls from here

20:34.230 --> 20:39.960
and here the people are frauds

20:41.060 --> 20:46.330
they cheat a lot and also criticize .

20:47.660 --> 20:51.500
So, in the beginning itself your Agnya is scared.

20:51.930 --> 20:53.600
They will become very wealthy.

20:53.700 --> 20:58.430
But, in the end you find that Mr. wealthy is going to hell.

20:58.530 --> 21:01.200
Today, I want to tell you the

21:01.560 --> 21:04.260
meaning of Diwali is that-

21:04.300 --> 21:08.330
hell is dark and you have become the light.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.160
It is expected of you that you must fight wherever there is darkness

21:15.060 --> 21:17.200
and make it known publicly that it is wrong.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.130
With this our country is going to improve.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.130
This is yet another job that you have to do.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.160
We are performing puja rituals already.

21:26.430 --> 21:30.700
But,the innate power that is within us is the one

21:30.960 --> 21:35.330
which stands opposed to  all that is untrue.

21:36.150 --> 21:41.930
Many people are obsessed with earning illegal money and do not know

21:42.240 --> 21:45.200
that directly they will go to hell.

21:46.030 --> 21:47.530
I am telling you all these

21:48.300 --> 21:51.530
since no one ever spoke about it before.

21:52.030 --> 21:54.960
On this day of Diwali let us say

21:55.700 --> 21:58.000
that we will celebrate the joy

21:58.400 --> 22:00.660
and light the lamps within our hearts.

22:01.230 --> 22:05.230
In that light we will be able recognize

22:05.660 --> 22:08.960
who is in what state and who are cheating.

22:09.060 --> 22:12.330
Now,I notice another kind of fight.

22:12.930 --> 22:15.260
Fights between the Hindus and Muslims are  over,

22:15.960 --> 22:18.430
now others have picked up fighting.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.630
It means we are also very quarrelsome.

22:25.330 --> 22:27.330
At least in the other countries

22:27.530 --> 22:31.330
one does not find religions of so many countries in one place.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.600
But, at the slightest opportunity we pick up  fights here.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.130
Fighting becomes the priority.

22:39.630 --> 22:43.430
Fights between husband and wife, then within their children

22:43.460 --> 22:48.000
and also amongst them who are in contact with each other.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.500
What is Sahaja Yoga?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.200
Sahaja Yoga is love. Love.

22:54.300 --> 22:58.030
Awaken that power of love that is within you.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.600
Today is supposed to be a very auspicious day.

23:07.870 --> 23:13.330
We have to light the lamps in our hearts and make it certain by all means

23:13.640 --> 23:16.700
that, even if we have to die, we won’t tell lies.

23:16.910 --> 23:19.000
We already have such people with us.

23:22.430 --> 23:26.000
But, our reputation across the world is so much damaged claiming

23:26.230 --> 23:29.930
that Indians have become dishonest.

23:30.260 --> 23:32.630
Well, I have never come across one atleast,

23:33.100 --> 23:35.360
but when discussed, I feel very sad.

23:35.820 --> 23:38.430
A holy place like India

23:39.130 --> 23:42.160
where great saints had taken their birth

23:43.260 --> 23:44.530
unlike any other place. Sufis were also born here.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.700
all those who became great had been from India only.

23:49.030 --> 23:53.060
No other countries ever had so many great souls.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.600
A few may have been there,

23:57.600 --> 24:02.260
but we have had several great souls here.

24:02.261 --> 24:02.262


24:03.360 --> 24:07.160
But, later even after ignoring whatever they might have taught us,

24:08.100 --> 24:10.260
we became branded thieves.

24:10.900 --> 24:17.330
So whoever cheats people they can never ascend to heaven.

24:17.560 --> 24:21.260
Compaired to the lifespan spent here,

24:21.300 --> 24:25.260
one has to spend a lifespans that is thousand times more in hell.

24:26.300 --> 24:30.060
The reason I am speaking about hell

24:30.100 --> 24:33.400
on this day is only because hell means the darkness

24:34.000 --> 24:37.460
and that is the hell that we witness.

24:38.200 --> 24:43.230
Now your lamps are lit. In that light, you must

24:44.030 --> 24:47.590
recognize the kinds of hell.

24:47.860 --> 24:52.060
You should support the government.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.000
Extend help to identify ,who are dishonest. You may be in a junior or a senior

24:56.130 --> 24:58.600
position, but you must speak it out

24:59.500 --> 25:04.330
as to who are the culprits.Catch the culprits.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.630
Expose those who are liars.

25:09.330 --> 25:11.460
Now you have the powers with you – for  what purpose? You are awakened,

25:14.660 --> 25:16.500
for what purpose? You are enlightened.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.360
In  that light, you must see yourself.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.430
In darkness we acheive nothing, but

25:23.230 --> 25:27.230
watch in your own light to realize what you are.

25:28.660 --> 25:33.100
Also by lying  what are you going to achieve?

25:35.960 --> 25:37.300
I am a housewife.I have never lied. Never ever. Neither can ever.

25:37.930 --> 25:43.400
The moment you are compelled to lie,

25:45.360 --> 25:47.400
you have the powers within, you are all lamps.

25:48.230 --> 25:50.600
You just see them in this darkness.

25:52.030 --> 25:56.130
You are the lamps

25:56.930 --> 25:58.560
and the lamps are supposed to give light.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.630
We have to wipe out this darkness.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.460
There is a bad reputation about us from far across.

26:04.460 --> 26:08.500
While the fact is , nowhere else you will ever find people like that of our country.

26:08.930 --> 26:10.500
It gives great pain when I learn

26:11.530 --> 26:14.360
what misconceptions the people have about us.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.660
God knows what does one achieve by dishonesty?

26:18.500 --> 26:21.300
But whatever may be the outcome, it is horrible.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.130
No one will be spared.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.200
Whoever has become dishonest will be caught.

26:28.230 --> 26:29.660
There are all arrangements for that.

26:31.230 --> 26:34.000
You have got your Realization because you are not dishonest.

26:34.660 --> 26:38.460
You love truth and respect the truth.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.930
I want that you should stand on truth.

26:43.960 --> 26:51.600
Now for example,people throw garbage into the river Yamuna.It is stupidity.

26:52.660 --> 26:55.960
Yamunaji itself descends directly to hell,

26:57.260 --> 27:04.060
but you will be saved from that hell since

27:04.360 --> 27:05.460
you are realized souls.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.130
One who has the light generally do not fall.

27:10.500 --> 27:20.230
But, if you sincerly want to establish Sahaja Yoga fully within yourself,

27:21.560 --> 27:23.130
then in the beginning, you have to swear that you

27:23.360 --> 27:26.200
will never commit dishonesty of any kind.

27:28.260 --> 27:31.500
It seems earning money has become the only means of business left out in this world.

27:32.430 --> 27:34.230
What does one get out of it?

27:35.630 --> 27:37.460
Nobody even remembers them.

27:40.600 --> 27:45.600
If you love your country, then at first you must establish the truth

27:45.730 --> 27:50.530
or else who can trust the liar?

27:51.200 --> 27:55.160
It is a big hurdle for you

27:55.230 --> 27:58.660
because you always have a feeling that when my neighbour is like this

27:59.000 --> 28:00.630
then why  I too don't become like that?

28:00.960 --> 28:02.900
But,  why don’t you think instead when I can belike this,

28:03.230 --> 28:05.460
then why not transform my neighbour likewise?

28:07.330 --> 28:11.460
First of all, today you must promise that we shall neither

28:13.660 --> 28:16.630
commit any dishonesty nor support any dishonest person.

28:23.060 --> 28:29.000
Falsehood in our country, not sure why, but

28:30.360 --> 28:33.500
seems like a curse on us.

28:33.700 --> 28:38.030
There are several people who would not be  satisfied until they utter

28:38.230 --> 28:40.300
at least ten lies from morning until evening.

28:41.030 --> 28:42.900
Now your poverty is finished. Everything is quite all right.

28:43.230 --> 28:45.200
All food and stuff are available.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.360
None of you are beggars, yet why do you lie?

28:51.530 --> 28:52.700
So let this be the resolution of the day

28:53.000 --> 28:54.530
that you will not lie any more and, if anyone is a liar then

28:54.700 --> 28:56.960
we shall not join hands to rejoice with that person.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.630
We will have no relationship with him.

29:01.500 --> 29:05.630
There  is plenty of joy in it.

29:07.530 --> 29:13.900
Because, do you know that a liar will go to hell

29:15.660 --> 29:19.530
and you too will follow him from behind.

29:19.600 --> 29:20.460
God has given you Realization.

29:20.530 --> 29:24.300
You have the light within and in that light you should identify the

29:25.260 --> 29:29.060
other like-minded people and then must

29:29.530 --> 29:32.630
decide that we will not lie whatever may come,

29:33.300 --> 29:35.430
even if we are beheaded.

29:38.430 --> 29:43.060
In these  matters I know the Indians are very good.

29:43.530 --> 29:46.130
But when I hear certain comments about them outside

29:46.560 --> 29:48.900
then  I feel very sad.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.400
For example, the road that is constructed,

29:53.160 --> 29:55.460
does it resemble a road by any means?

29:55.900 --> 29:58.500
I felt if I was travelling in the jungles.

30:00.230 --> 30:04.530
Whenever you come across such a thing, you have

30:05.100 --> 30:08.460
an organization; you must collectively inquire as to

30:09.160 --> 30:12.900
who were responsible for the construction? Why it had to be constructed that way?

30:13.960 --> 30:19.230
Who had consumed the money? All the Sahaja Yogis should get united

30:20.330 --> 30:29.930
and try focussing your attention in that  direction to drive out the bhoots

30:32.700 --> 30:37.530
out which have crept into India. Wherever you go,you will hear people commenting:

30:39.000 --> 30:42.500
“Brothers, don’t believe in the Indians." What a shame.

30:43.660 --> 30:48.430
The irony is: in who one should

30:50.430 --> 30:53.330
trust the most are we Indians only. Nevertheless, we had so many of them

30:53.500 --> 30:58.060
who were great leaders, great people and great souls.

30:59.600 --> 31:03.460
But we have completely ignored them and their great fame of past.

31:03.900 --> 31:08.000
How much amount of respect people had for them and also they have for you too – I know that.

31:08.360 --> 31:12.530
But you should never extend company or support to the cheats.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.330
The moment you realize that a certain person is a cheat,

31:15.530 --> 31:19.030
then even avoid having meals at his home.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.300
It will become very difficult for the cheats to survive.

31:24.930 --> 31:27.000
I am telling you that

31:27.360 --> 31:30.600
you  all are the police force of God.

31:31.330 --> 31:36.230
Keep track of all those cheats that you come across.

31:37.130 --> 31:40.430
Try to instill courage in your children.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.430
If one is doing something wrong or lying, identify them.

31:46.530 --> 31:51.460
This country has received blessings alongwith many other saints.

31:51.530 --> 31:57.460
and you all are saints.

31:57.630 --> 32:00.500
There is no need for you to lie.

32:00.630 --> 32:03.360
Well, what's going to happen if you have one time meal only?

32:03.400 --> 32:06.160
Nobody dies if one doesnot have a meal.

32:06.260 --> 32:08.460
We do have food

32:08.600 --> 32:11.500
but they prefer drink alcohol.

32:11.960 --> 32:17.060
By drinking alcohol, we take a step further towards our own destruction.

32:17.160 --> 32:20.200
If there is alcohol

32:20.900 --> 32:23.960
we can never be all right.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.300
Now for example, in America,

32:29.360 --> 32:31.030
they always come up with newer subjects,

32:31.230 --> 32:34.460
Like the moment their children turns sixteen

32:35.060 --> 32:37.260
they become worthless. Does this mean that  they are all like servants?

32:37.600 --> 32:41.930
When they work or wash cars they are paid for it.

32:41.950 --> 32:45.460
And what they claim as they attain the age of sixteen?

32:45.660 --> 32:50.960
“Well, now that we have turned sixteen and so it is the time to go out for a living.”

32:52.130 --> 32:53.300
I have seen this happening with the

32:53.960 --> 32:57.200
poor children of sixteen everywhere,

32:57.600 --> 33:01.300
whereas we (in India) think, “He is just turning sixteen,

33:01.700 --> 33:06.200
where will he go or What should he study?”

33:06.630 --> 33:08.360
But,(in America) since he has turned sixteen years of age,

33:08.430 --> 33:12.300
he is driven out of the home both by his mother and father.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.160
Just keep on watching for how long is this going to last with the Americans?

33:16.500 --> 33:18.000
They are in the state of destruction.

33:18.930 --> 33:23.300
Nobody becomes great by buying one or two airplanes.

33:23.430 --> 33:29.460
Where do you think you are? How far are your limitations?

33:30.600 --> 33:34.530
India is such a country that it can save the entire world

33:42.030 --> 33:47.130
– the entire world. But there should be truthfulness in it.

33:47.560 --> 33:53.300
It is very essential to imbibe the truthfulness. Truthfulness in each and every matter.

33:53.700 --> 33:57.630
I can’t understand, What is the need for nurturing falsehood?

33:57.730 --> 34:01.860
people who are rich should realize in the begining itself that they are already rich.

34:01.930 --> 34:06.060
So it is better for them to sit back quietly and stop planning to earn anymore.

34:06.300 --> 34:12.000
I am yet to see Who is happy

34:14.160 --> 34:17.130
by earning lots of money?

34:17.700 --> 34:23.960
You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have the light within you.

34:23.990 --> 34:29.430
In the light you lead other and the path is of truth.

34:31.600 --> 34:35.160
May you be a Muslim, a Hindu or a Christian. It makes no difference.

34:35.200 --> 34:39.000
You all are humans. And if honesty is missing in a person,

34:39.060 --> 34:43.430
then he is dishonest. No one will recognize him.

34:44.260 --> 34:49.630
We have to spend lifespan even beyond this also. How will that be?

34:50.560 --> 34:54.300
Through honesty there can be several benefits.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.200
The greatest of all is that

34:56.300 --> 35:00.000
you have the blessings of God on you.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.430
Blessings come in such a manner that

35:03.500 --> 35:06.160
you will be astonished to know

35:06.230 --> 35:09.100
that everything are effortlessly accomplished on its own.

35:09.700 --> 35:14.300
But now in India, everyone runs after money

35:14.700 --> 35:18.030
whether they have or donot have.

35:18.060 --> 35:22.260
Yet, there are many poor around.

35:22.560 --> 35:26.930
That is why today Diwali should be for them also.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.030
They too should be happy.

35:29.330 --> 35:32.830
We are citizens of that country.

35:32.960 --> 35:38.260
But we deceive ourselves only. We pose to be  very clever.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.230
By this, ego develops within us. And when ego is developed,

35:42.900 --> 35:49.030
nobody can save by any means.

35:49.900 --> 35:53.300
With ego, you will develop cancer.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.030
Therefore you will not be able to save yourself

35:56.100 --> 35:59.160
if you develop cancer. You cannot save yourself.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.400
I cannot save you. I am telling you the truth.

36:03.060 --> 36:07.930
So, first of all , you should burn the ego in fire that you possess within .

36:10.200 --> 36:12.900
If you have ego then you must be ashamed of it.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.160
“Ego for what"?

36:17.530 --> 36:20.060
It is prevelent for everything in our country .

36:20.130 --> 36:24.560
Someone passes a Bachelor degree examination,  he develops ego.

36:24.700 --> 36:29.000
Achieving someother  qualification higher than that gives him double ego.

36:29.160 --> 36:32.000
One achieves something,

36:32.060 --> 36:34.000
becomes an engineer or a doctor,

36:34.530 --> 36:37.030
he develops ego.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.530
Thus, when this Agnya chakra gets caught,

36:40.200 --> 36:45.030
where does it ultimately lead you to? To hell.

36:46.900 --> 36:51.160
And hell is a very horrible place.

36:51.630 --> 36:54.560
God has blessed you with intelligence

36:55.400 --> 36:57.130
and now you have got your Realization.

36:58.230 --> 37:02.360
Still if you want to go to the hell, you can go.

37:00.200 --> 38:05.030
It is only when you remain honest and

37:04.500 --> 37:07.360
Until this day nobody spoke about it or told you.

37:07.530 --> 37:12.000
Today is the day that is considered auspicious

37:12.330 --> 37:15.500
because several good things happened.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.100
During the period of Ramachandraji, Sitaji returned home.

37:21.700 --> 37:27.960
During Krishna’s times and several other occasion that were marked by great events

37:28.500 --> 37:32.630
were all worked out by the realized souls.

37:32.730 --> 37:36.260
That is why, in the first place, you must take a vow today that

37:36.660 --> 37:39.900
“We will not commit any dishonesty for sure

37:40.030 --> 37:44.130
and if anyone does, then we shall ensure

37:45.930 --> 37:48.400
that he is caught.”

37:48.560 --> 37:51.000
But I notice that in this country the blacks are at war with the whites

37:51.160 --> 37:53.430
any one picking up fight with the other.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.360
They want to divide India into fragments.

37:56.560 --> 38:00.100
It is not going to benefit anyway. But how is it going to benefit?

38:05.660 --> 38:09.130
you possess a good moral character.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.030
Whatever you have learnt from the English,

38:12.130 --> 38:15.230
there was nothing worth learning from them.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.930
They are all in a bad state these days.

38:20.660 --> 38:24.500
But we have to save our own country

38:24.530 --> 38:27.560
and also to save the entire world. It is a great responsibility.

38:27.660 --> 38:31.800
You have been realized and the light has come within you.

38:31.960 --> 38:37.160
Yet, you want to jump into the ditch,what can anyone do?

38:41.060 --> 38:44.000
Everyone should join together to make an effort.

38:44.100 --> 38:48.260
I want the Sahaja Yogis should constitute a committee.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.200
In case you come across any cheating,

38:51.530 --> 38:54.230
you should report it to the committee.

38:54.630 --> 38:57.400
Then let us see what the committee does.

38:57.630 --> 39:00.300
In this way, you'll earn a good name.

39:00.100 --> 39:04.000
In this way, you will be elevated to higher positions.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.230
So, in the first place neither you be a dishonest yourself

39:06.630 --> 39:10.360
nor let any other be.

39:10.430 --> 39:12.030
This is very important for you have

39:12.300 --> 39:16.530
great blemish on your country.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.360
There is adulteration in the edible oil,

39:20.530 --> 39:22.030
adulteration in the ghee.

39:22.260 --> 39:26.300
Everywhere  people make a mockery at us.

39:26.430 --> 39:29.260
No one has faith in us.

39:29.330 --> 39:33.700
In fact, the best of the people are in India.

39:34.530 --> 39:40.630
Nowhere you find so many people

39:40.631 --> 39:40.700
who have had their realization.

39:41.230 --> 39:44.500
They have not earned any sort of punyas(virtues/spiritual merits).

39:45.460 --> 39:50.930
Therefore, it is nobler to earn punyas than to earn money.

39:52.330 --> 39:56.430
Look at those people who are very poor.

39:58.030 --> 40:02.400
So today is a very auspicious day and also a day of joy.

40:02.530 --> 40:08.060
Joy for what? Because on this day we have been blessed

40:08.560 --> 40:12.430
with heaven and we desire to be in heaven only.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.360
But cowards can never make it to heaven.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.700
There is no need to be afraid.

40:21.400 --> 40:25.460
Well, what diaster is going to come even if you earn

40:25.560 --> 40:28.530
a few paise(Indian currency coin) less or more?

40:29.960 --> 40:32.160
All of you have become rich. I can see that is quite visible and

40:32.530 --> 40:35.900
I have been coming here(Delhi) for the past 17 or 18 years now.

40:36.300 --> 40:39.360
All of you have become richer than before.

40:39.430 --> 40:42.200
Conditions have improved now compared to earlier.

40:42.330 --> 40:43.700
But, from morning until evening there is

40:44.000 --> 40:47.200
dishonesty, dishonesty and dishonesty.

40:47.760 --> 40:52.750
So, the path is now laid down before you. therefore,just promise today

40:52.830 --> 40:57.000
that we shall not commit any dishonesty and, if anyone is found doing

40:57.530 --> 41:01.660
then we shall collectively oppose him.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.460
Why did Sahaja Yoga

41:04.550 --> 41:06.700
give you Realization?

41:07.200 --> 41:11.160
It is because you will emit light.

41:11.230 --> 41:15.120
If you do not posses light within, then how can you emit light outside?

41:15.160 --> 41:20.360
In that light try to see for yourself whether you are helping the dishonest?

41:21.100 --> 41:25.260
Nothing happens if you earn a little less or more.

41:25.260 --> 41:30.060
If you are honest, then God helps you.

41:30.060 --> 41:33.550
Now , you see for yourself , I never take money from anyone.It is true.

41:33.550 --> 41:37.980
But, I wrote a book

41:38.100 --> 41:40.770
and received lots of money from it.

41:41.110 --> 41:44.900
I shall neither allow anyone to take anything.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.500
Why do so many people die in our country

41:50.830 --> 41:54.060
compared to anywhere else?

41:54.130 --> 41:58.900
The reason is because people want to go to hell.

41:59.630 --> 42:03.600
So, you should know this, that if you commit dishonesty,

42:03.730 --> 42:06.860
then your first step have already been established in hell

42:08.700 --> 42:12.660
and secondly you don’t need to utter lies at all.

42:12.670 --> 42:16.000
You must speak the truth.

42:16.530 --> 42:24.030
The man who speaks the truth becomes a unique person.

42:24.530 --> 42:30.130
If he practises Sahaja Yoga, then it can be remarkable.

42:30.730 --> 42:33.380
As you are remembering the Sufis today,

42:33.430 --> 42:35.930
similarly people will remember you then.

42:36.980 --> 42:38.710
You don’t need to do anything

42:39.310 --> 42:42.310
only expose those who are dishonest.

42:45.410 --> 42:47.340
It is important.

42:47.390 --> 42:49.000
Here the people are querreling...

42:49.040 --> 42:52.940
"Don't throw garbage into the Yamunaji and

42:53.110 --> 42:55.210
don’t throw that". Now, do this also needs to be told.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.010
I have been to so many countries.

42:57.650 --> 43:01.150
Nowhere the waste is disposed into any river.

43:01.250 --> 43:06.640
Then why are you so lazy? There are so many facilities made available.

43:07.010 --> 43:13.420
You can hand it over to the municipality or dispose it elsewhere.

43:13.570 --> 43:16.700
But if you are accumulating the waste yourself,

43:16.900 --> 43:19.950
then what can you do?

43:20.850 --> 43:24.250
All of you should think in your mind and decide today.

43:24.250 --> 43:26.810
It is a very good day today. It is a good day.

43:27.780 --> 43:34.640
That neither  shall we ever commit any dishonesty nor acknowledge the dishonest.

43:35.150 --> 43:37.820
I have seen such people

43:38.350 --> 43:42.260
who neither had been dishonest nor ever visited the house

43:42.280 --> 43:45.050
of any dishonest person. They never kept any connection with them.

43:45.410 --> 43:48.910
because they not only harmed themselves

43:49.150 --> 43:52.800
but had also been harmful for the nation..

43:53.010 --> 43:55.200
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.280
You should promise that

43:57.450 --> 44:01.360
we shall never commit any dishonesty.

44:01.730 --> 44:04.280
And if some one happens to be dishonest

44:04.350 --> 44:07.480
then you must beat him collectively.Don't worry.

44:12.860 --> 44:23.130
For that you need not think "why to beat him, there is government to look after".

44:23.270 --> 44:24.840
It doesn't matter.

44:25.080 --> 44:30.310
You have to recognize only who are dishonest

44:30.470 --> 44:38.010
and tell it to your inner Sprit that he is dishonest.

44:38.010 --> 44:41.910
And for the Sahaja Yogis – even if 12 Sahaja Yogis can unite and collectively

44:43.080 --> 44:45.750
identify that this particular person is dishonest,

44:47.850 --> 44:51.210
then God is with you.

44:54.780 --> 44:59.250
Merely by a handful of rich people the welfare of  the country cannot improve.

44:59.780 --> 45:03.110
But with honest people, certainly it can.

45:04.210 --> 45:06.750
So, the greatest blemish on us is

45:06.770 --> 45:08.650
that 'we are dishonest'.

45:08.650 --> 45:18.710
- What? - (inturruption addressing Sir CP)

45:25.710 --> 45:29.060
And those who are Sahaja Yogis can never be dishonest by any means.

45:29.140 --> 45:31.580
This is My belief.

45:35.150 --> 45:39.750
We all need to be united.

45:40.350 --> 45:41.940
Leave aside all differences.

45:42.170 --> 45:48.820
We are all honest people, India’s reputation is greatly tarnished.

45:53.280 --> 45:58.210
That is why take a vow from today

45:58.650 --> 46:01.050
that we shall not commit any dishonesty and if there are

46:01.380 --> 46:05.450
any other dishonest person, we shall collectively chase after him.

46:05.760 --> 46:09.930
He is sure to experience a sleepless night the next day itself.

46:13.310 --> 46:15.350
Nevertheless, it has gone too far.

46:16.280 --> 46:18.780
Now I've to tell you that I am astonished.

46:18.880 --> 46:23.280
There is dishonesty in everything – dishonesty in everything.

46:23.330 --> 46:27.890
Where ever you notice any dishonesty,

46:27.980 --> 46:30.700
Sahaja yogis should unite in group of ten to beat him.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.010
I am with you!

46:40.810 --> 46:45.880
In the earlier days people used to outcast others on petty matters.

46:47.150 --> 46:51.040
- 'What's the matter'?(Interruption...Mother discussing aside).

46:51.120 --> 46:54.380
They used to outcast

46:55.160 --> 46:59.870
and boycott on every minute issue.

47:01.350 --> 47:05.700
But, our country had remained so honest and

47:05.710 --> 47:09.680
had such great qualities.Why have we forgotten them?

47:09.780 --> 47:13.850
Where have they all gone?

47:15.280 --> 47:21.910
I find there is dishonesty everywhere. Dishonesty at every step.

47:22.280 --> 47:27.600
If you notice anyone practsing dishonesty  - then go and beat him.

47:27.700 --> 47:36.670
But it doesn't mean that you beat every other person who comes your way.It doesnot mean that.

47:43.390 --> 47:48.410
You must teach the children here that they should not become dishonest.

47:50.650 --> 47:53.180
In case they are dying of starvation

47:54.250 --> 47:56.450
then  arrangements could be made suitably,

47:56.910 --> 47:59.250
provided they are honest.

47:59.710 --> 48:06.010
But if honesty is not there,leave alone God,

48:06.250 --> 48:09.810
no one is going to help you. All kinds of diseases will come upon you.

48:09.850 --> 48:14.280
Coincidently, our country is full of such remarkable traditions, they are countless...

48:15.680 --> 48:21.910
For example, they will drink alcohol,liquor just imagine!

48:22.230 --> 48:27.380
Were you born to become a stupid?

48:27.490 --> 48:33.990
Stop being friendly to the person, who does it. Don’t support him.

48:34.210 --> 48:35.520
I have noticed that people who

48:38.250 --> 48:43.850
drink alcohol,people visit their houses and

48:44.750 --> 48:45.810
they also join in drinking alcohol. But if you come to know

48:46.180 --> 48:47.680
that a person is of such nature...

48:49.180 --> 48:52.350
or a particular person is dishonest, then stop having meals in his house.

48:52.710 --> 48:57.650
You should not have any concern (for them).

48:58.880 --> 49:01.450
We have to work for the betterment of our country

49:01.710 --> 49:03.710
because god has given us the light.You must judge in that light.

49:04.780 --> 49:08.710
His powers are tremendous.

49:09.480 --> 49:15.850
If you are able to realize that those who had been dishonest

49:17.850 --> 49:21.030
to the nation will be taken care of by God.That will work out everything. It is enough.

49:21.350 --> 49:26.210
But, you seem to have turn deaf and refuse to understand.

49:26.510 --> 49:29.680
Such people neither can ever do good

49:29.890 --> 49:32.480
nor can ever deliver.

49:33.710 --> 49:38.550
I don’t understand how do those shameless people exist? I really donot know.

49:38.610 --> 49:40.120
But, they do exist.

49:40.280 --> 49:46.150
For that reason, today's message for you is

49:46.260 --> 49:50.910
that you must vow on this day onwards

49:51.070 --> 49:53.590
that we shall never ever commit any dishonesty

49:53.650 --> 49:57.030
and if someone is dishonest, then we shall not support him.

49:57.140 --> 49:59.720
That is enough.

50:16.210 --> 50:21.970
Many more realized souls will come to our country.

50:22.190 --> 50:26.970
But, who would like to be born in such a dishonest country like this?

50:40.280 --> 50:44.350
The only message for you today is that you have the light within

50:44.810 --> 50:49.450
and you have carry forward your mission in that light

50:50.150 --> 50:53.130
that is going to provide you the strength.

50:53.510 --> 50:57.810
Whatever you wish to do, you are welcome.

50:58.250 --> 51:03.150
Look, we have achieved our 'swatantrata'.

51:03.680 --> 51:06.750
'Swa'-'tantra'...try to know the 'swa'(ownSelf).

51:06.750 --> 51:10.810
It's for you...( inturruptions- in-betweenlittle child hands over flowers to Mother)

51:13.980 --> 51:19.220
Now, I want that many children to be born. They should be realized.

51:21.560 --> 51:28.780
That is why you must learn in the begining.....

51:32.280 --> 51:34.510
Today is a great day.

51:35.210 --> 51:44.340
You must promise today that neither will we commit any dishonesty nor be involved with the dishonest persons.

51:44.860 --> 51:47.470
or be afraid of them.

51:47.740 --> 51:52.580
God is never with them. God is with you.

51:54.810 --> 52:02.820
If you are good, then God is with you.

52:03.180 --> 52:07.110
Everyone of you were born in this land of India, it indeed wasn't for the sake of

52:08.880 --> 52:10.850
fighting amongst each other to die.

52:12.110 --> 52:17.130
Ignorant fools, we fight each other and then die.

52:17.850 --> 52:20.850
There is no use in fighting, you should tell this to people.

52:20.980 --> 52:23.990
“Well, what are you fighting for ?

52:24.000 --> 52:28.770
What do you want? Why? After all, what do you want?

52:28.840 --> 52:34.250
There is enough to eat and drink. What more do you want?”

52:34.930 --> 52:37.700
But, nowadays the demands are like ,

52:37.840 --> 52:41.410
“I need that dress, I want such kind of house

52:42.150 --> 52:45.210
and not this type.”

52:45.280 --> 52:50.630
And with all those, let's go to hell.

52:50.800 --> 52:53.860
At this moment...(Inturrupted by Sir CP and speaking to Sir CP)

52:57.060 --> 53:02.280
(Sir) OK, enough, that'll do.

53:10.020 --> 53:13.060
- No-no, Its all fine......

53:23.780 --> 53:27.910
Like those who had become Sufis, you are all Sufis too

53:27.920 --> 53:31.520
because you have been cleansed.

53:32.050 --> 53:37.630
Now all of you should write poems – on honesty.

53:37.840 --> 53:42.950
This element of dishonesty needs to go in the first place

53:42.950 --> 53:49.340
and secondly, there are many issues that need to be taken care of.

53:49.610 --> 53:54.130
But first of all, never commit dishonesty.

53:54.130 --> 53:59.600
No one is that poor in India

53:59.850 --> 54:04.340
that he needs to take to dishonesty.

54:04.840 --> 54:07.640
- What?(speaking aside)

54:07.640 --> 54:14.780
What I am saying is, there is a blemish on our country and it needs to be wiped out.

54:16.110 --> 54:19.700
And you are Sahaja Yogis. You can do it.

54:19.970 --> 54:23.490
You have the light with you. With it

54:23.760 --> 54:28.810
you can spread the light everywhere.

54:29.080 --> 54:34.930
You must encourage everyone to show the  right things.

54:35.060 --> 54:37.260
Those young amongst you, who are friends

54:37.390 --> 54:42.680
should think what honestful work they can undertake.

54:42.710 --> 54:46.700
Now a campaign is initiated  to prohibit dumping anything into River Yamunaj.

54:46.970 --> 54:51.760
That is all right, but it is not as important.

54:51.890 --> 54:54.290
More important aspect is losing one's honesty.

54:55.220 --> 55:01.270
That is why this day is considered auspicious everywhere.

55:01.400 --> 55:04.330
Lamps are lit at all the places.

55:04.590 --> 55:09.650
Everything is done and if we can’t do this bit,

55:10.180 --> 55:13.370
then there is no use being a sahaj yogi.

55:13.770 --> 55:22.430
We have the  largest collectivity of Sahaja Yogis in India – the largest collectivity.

55:25.380 --> 55:28.650
Next to it is in Russia.

55:28.780 --> 55:33.180
Now, the Russians are very humble.

55:33.210 --> 55:36.290
they dont steal or cheat

55:36.430 --> 55:38.530
I really don’t understand how?

55:39.280 --> 55:41.810
Maybe if communism comes here,probably

55:42.150 --> 55:44.750
we too would become like them.

55:45.080 --> 55:48.820
But it does not make very big sense.

55:49.980 --> 55:52.930
It is not good to impose compulsion to achieve anything..

55:53.400 --> 55:56.160
Let us impose strictness on ourselves.

55:56.270 --> 56:00.930
Decide it for good. Take up the resolution today only.

56:01.060 --> 56:03.190
Today is a very good day to start,

56:03.250 --> 56:09.370
that neither shall we commit any dishonesty nor let others commit it.

56:13.050 --> 56:17.750
Your country will become very prosperous.

56:19.350 --> 56:23.340
And after all what is any other country? I have seen all of them.

56:23.740 --> 56:26.270
All are useless people.

56:26.270 --> 56:32.780
But,people of our country still have a lot of dharma(righteousness) in them.

56:35.680 --> 56:39.080
The dharma in our country has been destroyed

56:39.170 --> 56:42.010
since the dishonest became all the very powerful.

56:42.010 --> 56:50.140
Try to find out whether someone is dishonest and then make advances for picketting on him.

56:50.280 --> 56:54.130
You are so many, you must gather together for picketting on him.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.530
- What..?(Mother speaking aside)

56:56.660 --> 57:01.050
and that would make a lot of difference.

57:02.780 --> 57:07.420
- Haan!, Well , better you don't interrupt me in-between... (speaking to Sir CP)

57:17.380 --> 57:19.080
So the only  message today is

57:19.410 --> 57:25.790
that neither we shall ever commit dishonesty nor allow anyothers to commit.

57:26.720 --> 57:31.580
But the people here are very tolerant in this matter.

57:31.710 --> 57:35.970
They tolerate. This is the greatest mistake.

57:36.230 --> 57:39.980
When you have got the light, then why do you fear?

57:41.020 --> 57:43.710
What is the reason for you to be afraid?

57:48.450 --> 57:53.650
That is why I am requesting you today to do everything with courage.

57:54.060 --> 57:56.780
And now you have got a kind of swatantrata (freedom).

57:57.180 --> 58:01.440
You will attain (knowledge) the tantra (the system) of the swa (Self).

58:01.570 --> 58:03.300
You have already attained it,

58:03.640 --> 58:08.180
but try to make use of it.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.810
Today so many of you have gathered here.

58:13.940 --> 58:16.950
I had never seen so many in Delhi before.

58:25.050 --> 58:29.570
Therefore,today every one of you must decide in mind

58:29.700 --> 58:34.310
that we will not accept any dishonest person at all.And the rakshasas too incarnate at this time due to these reasons.

58:35.030 --> 58:38.810
Doesn't it go to show that we too have certain weaknesses within.

58:39.420 --> 58:42.780
That 's why  they believe that the weaknesses within us,

58:43.210 --> 58:46.150
will ultimately compel us to accept them.

58:46.730 --> 58:49.950
Indians should never accept them.

58:50.190 --> 58:57.880
Besides the persons who have received their Realization , should never ever accept them.

58:57.900 --> 59:01.160
There is a bad reputation about our country everywhere.

59:01.430 --> 59:03.560
But this is not true.

59:03.820 --> 59:07.950
There are several persons in India who are honest – in great number.

59:07.950 --> 59:10.810
Nevertheless, it is not true

59:10.870 --> 59:14.780
but I have seen it Myself that

59:15.790 --> 59:22.310
they will quarrel amongst each other saying,“This land is mine and that land is yours.”

59:23.410 --> 59:26.910
Well whatever is yours is 'Swaraj'.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.750
It is the 'rajya' (kingdom) of the 'swa' (Self).

59:31.150 --> 59:32.410
Swaraj can only happen

59:33.180 --> 59:36.680
when you really become 'swatantra' in the true sense.

59:37.280 --> 59:45.010
There is no need to be afraid of anyone. There is no need to tell anything to anyone.

59:46.650 --> 59:52.110
I am astonished to see so many people.

59:52.350 --> 59:54.310
I had never seen so many people in My life.

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:10.930
So, I have only one request to you and that is today,

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.660
on this occasion of a very auspicious day,

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.520
decide that we shall never commit dishonesty even if we have to die.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:25.970
secondly,if there is any dishonest, then collectively take care of him.

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:33.750
By the way I told you all these things. But it seems the government is not able to do anything.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.850
In the  last 10 years our country deteriorated a lot .

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:47.050
You all are  Sahaja Yogis and  so many in numbers. Who are you all afraid of?

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.650
What is the reason to fear?

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:58.230
God is there behind everyone, to support.

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:08.730
Just see for yourself, as soon as the Sufis realized

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.350
that God was behind them,

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:16.520
they got rid of all those unwanted things that were around them

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.110
– not all, but a few of the sufis.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.150
That is what  you all should do.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:29.550
In My opinion, the only message for today is that

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.910
now  neither you are a cheat yourself, nor will help any cheat.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.900
I have been reading in the papers that

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:45.300
there are differences over several other issues.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.010
Differences are over the caste and creed.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:55.530
Well, are your efforts for protecting the country or for drowning ?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.250
You have a great responsibility on you.

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.730
You are born in the Kali Yuga.

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:06.830
That is why this Kali Yuga is to be transformed

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.910
and you are all realized in the thousands.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.980
Nowhere else have so many people been realized on Earth.

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:21.170
That is why time and again I shall be repeating to you

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:24.940
to stand on truth. I am with you.

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:39.180
And God is also with you.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.850
I was never worried about money.

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:52.350
I've lived without money only, I don't need them.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.730
I have so many children, what shall I do with money?

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:13.900
So I have a request to you all today to assert within yourself

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:18.620
that we shall not allow any offences like cheating or stealing to happen.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.670
Wherever we come to know of it, we will fight it out there.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.590
I do not know what the people achieve by drinking alcohol or doing what?

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:40.100
But in this light what do you receive? It is 'Courage'!

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.760
so fight with courage!

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:46.220
Whatever are wrong with this country should be removed.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.810
It has earned a very bad reputation.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.150
There are many more issues,

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.310
but the most important one is that when there is no honesty at all,

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.180
how is God going to help you?

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:08.030
To earn money is not the help from God, but to be established in dharma is.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:14.420
There aren’t as many Sahaja Yogis anywhere else as you find here.

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:18.810
Further,Sahaja Yogis never involve themselves doing such activities also.

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:21.360
But I am telling you all this because

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.060
the atmosphere here is bad.

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:32.110
Over and above we have earned such a bad name all over.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:37.090
You have everything with you - food to eat and drink, clothes to wear.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.560
What else do you need?

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:50.200
You may enjoy movies, you enjoy that, you do have that much money.

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:57.380
But first of all, the obsession for the money should be got rid of.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:05.100
I have full faith in you that you will listen to My today's lecture carefully.

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:11.220
And let us take an oath today

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:18.400
that we shall not commit dishonesty at all, also will oppose them who commits.

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:36.090
The most important message that is to be understood

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:41.680
is that today our country needs honesty .

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:48.190
Nothing is more important than that. Your Mother stands for honesty.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:56.440
Fighting against Muslims,fighting with others, Ther is no need to fight with anybody.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:05.090
Let us fight within ourselves with us. That is all.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:08.150
All are good.

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:12.140
So what if you have only one shirt instead of ten?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.730
Likewise convince these things to women also.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.380
It will work out.... It will happen.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:28.410
Today’s speech is a little bit different. It is unique...

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:34.480
and you all have liked it. It was very kind of you.

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:58.740
Let's go.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.010
Well then, thank you.
