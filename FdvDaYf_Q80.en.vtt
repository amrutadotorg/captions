00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.450
Happy Diwali.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.160
Wish you all a very happy Diwali.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.570
You saw various kinds of dances.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.170
you must try to understand one thing from them

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.050
that whoever composed or spoke about them

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.220
Everyone spoke of one and the same thing.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.060
The most important thing that everyone said

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.130
was 'God is one'.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.460
'God is one'.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.200
There is no dispute amongst them.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.670
They incarnate on Earth in order to destroy the evil

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.700
and to condemn the evil doers.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.500
That is happening everywhere.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.530
I find everywhere

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.000
the evil people are getting exposed.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.740
Now, it is your duty also

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.700
to identify them who are evil,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.930
working against the will of God.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.750
Those Who go to any extreme for the sake of money.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.000
They  will all go to hell.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.730
We really do not know how many types of hells exist.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.500
The environment or the place where you are sitting now

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.400
is far beyond those hells.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.030
It has no connection with the hell at all.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.040
But, in spite of your being at this place

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.190
if you continue commiting sins and practice all sorts of wrong things,

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.900
then  you could go to hell too.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.930
There are various kinds of hell

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.760
and nice arrangements are there to go to those hells.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.230
Because,those who are supposed to go hell

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.600
can never even realize where are they going.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.600
While those who are saved,they go to the heaven.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.250
So, sitting at earth level nobody can know

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.380
that "I'll have to go to hell',

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.900
or by commiting wrong things, 'I'll  go to hell'.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.110
The meaning of 'Diwali' itself is :

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.650
like the lamps lit outside,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.830
should be lit within you.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:45.000
You must also realize that you are

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.420
like the lights in this world of darkness.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.640
You are the lamps and you're the lights. You have to emit the light.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.580
But, if the same is not fully enlightened from within,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.060
then how can you emit the light?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.660
You must also think  over it.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.460
That is why in the first place, the Sahaja Yogis

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.030
should know that the light is fully established within.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.460
Possibly that was the purpose

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.030
for which we had to come to this world.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.900
Until Jesus Christ no one ever spoke on these subjects.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.010
He incarnated at the Agnya Chakra level

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:37.430
and showed the world that He did not have any ego within Him.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.100
He was the son of the God,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.970
yet He had no ego.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.600
Those who came before Him

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.960
spoke but very little.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.400
Christ came and wanted that our Agnya chakra should become all right.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.300
Incidentally that Agnya chakra catches too much in your Delhi.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
What could be the reason for it?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.400
At the first place the English people came here to rule

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.630
and then Englishmen taught us arrogancy.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.160
They can easily be made out from your conversations.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.890
I have seen those days also

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.160
when our country was dependent.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.160
But, you've come out of that dependency.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.660
Now there is 'swatantrata'.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.260
And what is 'swatantranta'  supposed to be?  Is to know the 'Swa'

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.900
('ownself') and whoever has known his 'Self',

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.150
Knows the 'tantra' (system) of the 'Self'.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.050
Through Sahaja Yoga you have come to know about yourself.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.630
And now you know that you are the 'tantra'.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.620
Therefore, you have to walk on the path of that 'tantra' of the 'self'.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.130
Lot of works have been done in Delhi, they are visible.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.660
Works have also been done beyond Delhi.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.710
Now, the various problems in the people here are very well known to you.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.630
I need not tell you that.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.070
But , now that you have become 'swatantra' (independent),

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.040
so you must be able to judge yourself whether you possess such problems within  or not.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.310
First of all the problem is

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.200
that you have your own Agnya Chakra caught up.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.700
Jesus Christ passed away. He went to the cross,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.400
yet we did not learn anything from it.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.030
On the contrary, wherever there are Christian countries,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.100
they possess tremendous ego.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.120
They had their influence on us too.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.630
But, the worst part we find here is

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:20.380
that we donot know each other.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.640
There is quarrel everywhere,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.030
fights everywhere.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.640
There is no clarity in understanding amongst each other.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.820
So the first thing is that our minds need to be cleansed.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.860
Everything is possible in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.350
People can attain any position from anywhere.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.820
It is not necessary for that reason to go and sit in the Himalayas .

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.160
You can do it here in this city of Delhi itself.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.230
But, if you look around,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.400
you will find egoistical people.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.130
They have their Agnya chakra severely caught up.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.430
So it is really very difficult.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.450
Now, god has given another new thing called 'cancer'.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:13.300
If you have cancer and  your Agnya chakra is not set all right,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.600
then it can never get cured.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.030
And there will be great trouble.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.200
That is why those who are suffering from cancer

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.600
should take to Sahaja Yoga

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:34.160
and the ego within you must be got rid of.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.700
Because, wherever there is a government,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.160
ego comes into the people.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.260
We have so many government servants here

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.060
and they have a lot of ego within them.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.300
But, it is far more pronounced in the people

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.900
who have come from outside. They are like the 'grand fathers'(in negative sense)

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.930
to the ones here. And on top of it, they all drink alcohol.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.360
Just imagine they call themselves Christians

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.560
and they all drink alcohol.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.530
Therfore by drinking alcohol, you are going against yourself only.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:18.230
You are blocking your own Agnya chakra.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.130
You are compltely ignoring it.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.260
The person whose Agnya chakra is cleared out

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.330
he can never drink alcohol.Never ever can have alcohol.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.330
You find everywhere people drinking alcohol

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.400
and neither do they have any means to control it.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.200
Because,whenever they try to overcome

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.300
they start drinking even more.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.460
So, any kind of'lat'[addiction] drags us to slavery

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.130
... of any kind.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.130
Now, these days here you will find addiction to chewing 'paan' (betel-leaves)

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.200
and on top of it, adds tobacco into it.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.560
Just imagine. God has created you with such great love

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.330
in this country,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.930
so that you could become unique from the rest of the world.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.160
It can happen... and in fact the Indians are an example of that only.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.330
But, now I find a they have developed few more obsessions,

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.560
.Like...  people here prefer to'eat money'rather than eating their 'meals'.
(popular Indian proverb to denote practicing bribery).

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.160
Now, for example, the road by which I arrived here

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.400
was not there earlier.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.100
It shocked Me immensely to find that they have

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.100
constructed a new road recently. But, none can ever claim the same to be

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.260
a newly constructed one. Only the Indians can do such works..

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.430
I have never seen such shameless people anywhere else in the world

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.530
who could do such work. After all these are not needed.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:02.100
Anytime, one who is bigger than the other with riches can do such work.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.460
Therefore, today we need to acertain

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.960
in the first place that we must get our Agnya set right.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.100
The greatest thing at the Agnya level is

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.300
that we start thinking 'we are the best'

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:22.500
and we believe that we can run the world,

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.930
we can reform the world.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.360
When you are not all right yourself,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.030
then how can the world be set right?

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.430
Well, you must have seen a number of people

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.530
who respects and place you in high esteem

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.100
and still do a lot of wrong things.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.900
In this country people are corrupt practising bribery [paise khatey hain].

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.330
Tell Me how can god ever forgive us.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.330
The worst of all sins are stealing and taking bribe.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.000
The person who does these types of crimes,

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.000
you may try anything on him ,even if the person himself may try to do anything, perform pujas,

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.330
prayers, chant mantras, recite text from holy scriptures, read Namaz, pray in the name of Allah

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.200
they will be of no use to him.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.600
Today is your new year.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.700
I wish you all the best.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.360
And I want you to take a resolution

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:30.630
that from today onwards we will not utter lies. Never, ever you will utter any lies.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.660
I have been to places across the world and
learnt that Indians are branded as great liars everywhere.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.130
I do not understand why such brandings have come upon our country

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.560
that our people are liars.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.900
Where there have been so many great saints and prophets,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.400
so many of them became Sufis,

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.700
I wonder how people could speak up so much of lies there.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.930
So you've to promise today

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.530
that you will not tell lies

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.230
whatever may be the consequences.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.160
For that, you need  courage.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.000
But now that you are realized, what more of

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.660
courage do you require? for that matter You'll can never lie.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.660
Only when you become like that,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.430
people will start believing,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.400
that these people are truthful.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.160
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be truthful.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.200
In whatever occupation

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.260
may be in business or whatever,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.600
he may be an engineer constructing road or a doctor treating people.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.060
Nevertheless,

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:49.360
it can be hell for you if you still lie.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:58.930
Now you have transformed your own self,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.500
you are realized now.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.660
So, if the realized people ever lie,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.160
then they can never achieve anything good out of it.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.700
I feel very sad when I have to hear about our country from people outside

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.900
that people here (in India) are very dishonest,liars

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.030
and make money (illegally).

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.530
Today is your very auspicious day.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.300
Today you should all make sure

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.560
that we shall never lie, whatever may come.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.460
I am a woman Myself and that too of India.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.330
I have never lied.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.560
By lying, you'll only be at a loss.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.960
By dishonesty, you'll only be at a loss.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.130
In this manner even if you try to earn a bit more money or adopt other deceitful means

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.430
you will never be able to go to heaven.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:12.300
You can only go straight to hell.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.630
It is very important to know

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.500
there is a very bad reputation prevailing about us in other countries.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.060
Why did this bad reputation happen?

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.130
Because, we have such kind of people here.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.100
If you come to know that someone is dishonest, then you should form a committee

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:37.960
for him and then question him, “Mister, what do you mean by all these”?

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.460
For example, supposing there is a road

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.230
that has not been constructed properly,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.100
then try to investigate how much has been spent behind it.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.260
Then watch his actions to see what is he doing.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.160
Making money by such illegal means will

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.760
be spent ultimately towards drinking alcohol only, which is our enemy.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.500
Afterall,why do you want all these?

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.360
You already have a very good living,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.050
but there are many countries where people are poor,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.130
But I found them to be honest.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.330
So, honesty should be the first priority

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.000
that needs to be ascertained today.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.230
That we shall not commit dishonesty or

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.940
ever be in the company of dishonest people.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.530
Further, if anyone commits it, then we shall expose him.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.800
Now, people often grumbles,

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.160
“Mother, similar things happen here also or

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.500
similarly it prevails there also.”

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.360
But you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.620
Who are Sahaja Yogis,by no means are inferior to a policeman

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.960
or any person with a higher status.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.160
They possess great powers within them, but, all those powers come out of truth only.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.200
Truthfulness should be there.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.330
And I am very glad that

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.460
a lot of Sahaja Yogis are very truthful.Really Truthful.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.160
But, we require more Sahaja Yogis now

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.100
who can become truthful.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.700
Truthfulness is a very important aspect or else you could never

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.900
get rid of your Agnya. The Agnya is the place where one has 'ego'.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.930
When ego develops in a person

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.930
he commits any offence,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.300
any sin, criticizes, harms anyone, earns money illegally.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.630
They will all go to hell.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.200
I would like to caution you, that

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.530
you should not earn money illegally.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.300
It is not that you are dying

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.900
what have you achieved by earning more

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.230
What are you doing?

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.130
You may have acquired a few lights (bulbs) more

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.960
and may have kept of a few more women around- And what more?

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.360
But, when you'll go to hell, what will be your condition then?

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.230
I am speaking on this topic on the day of Diwali

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.200
because Diwali was celebrated

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.560
when Sitaji had returned to reunite with Shri Rama.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:16.330
Once our character is established,then  we can not remain slaves any more?

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.700
We are our own slaves only, not of others even by any means.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.360
You are not to lie for any purpose.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.160
I had been in Delhi for a very long period

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.460
and I was surprised, how much the people lie here.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.400
My goodness – they aren't afraid at all .

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.300
Speaking lies so blatantly

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:46.900
probably could help him achieve something, here or

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.600
even may help earn a few rupees extra.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.300
but can never go to heaven.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.160
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise  today onwards,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.860
'we neither shall ever lie nor ever support the liar .

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:07.600
People comment about our country that we are very dishonest.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.630
I have travelled into far remote places

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:18.900
and I found the people of Russia are  very good.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.630
They are already half-Sahaja Yogis

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.330
and there are so many  Sahaja Yogis too.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.530
I was not able to go to Russia this year.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.400
I shall definitely visit next year.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.840
However, this  makes it clear that

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.680
we can not handle democracy.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.900
We too should have been communist.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.960
Neither there is any stealing,trickery nor any lies spoken in those places

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.260
and they all love each other very much.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.960
There is great respect for Me too.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.500
But, it needs to be understood where are we  leading to after all. (       ^-where are we heading towards?)

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.000
Just for the sake of earning a few more (rupees), where are we heading?

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.460
What are we going to achieve?

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.930
Therefore, to begin with you must be honest.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:16.030
Your dishonesty  will cause trouble  to your own people.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.550
People blame India, claiming that people of this place are very  dishonest.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.900
I am ashamed to hear all this.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.300
You have had so many great saints

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.330
so many great souls from here

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:39.960
and here the people are frauds

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.330
they cheat a lot and also criticize .

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.500
So, in the beginning itself your Agnya is scared.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.600
They will become very wealthy.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.430
But, in the end you find that Mr. wealthy is going to hell.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.200
Today, I want to tell you the

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.260
meaning of Diwali is that-

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.330
hell is dark and you have become the light.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.160
It is expected of you that you must fight wherever there is darkness

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.200
and make it known publicly that it is wrong.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.130
With this our country is going to improve.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.130
This is yet another job that you have to do.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.160
We are performing puja rituals already.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.700
But,the innate power that is within us is the one

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.330
which stands opposed to  all that is untrue.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:41.930
Many people are obsessed with earning illegal money and do not know

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.200
that directly they will go to hell.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.530
I am telling you all these

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.530
since no one ever spoke about it before.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.960
On this day of Diwali let us say

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.000
that we will celebrate the joy

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.660
and light the lamps within our hearts.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.230
In that light we will be able recognize

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.960
who is in what state and who are cheating.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.330
Now,I notice another kind of fight.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.260
Fights between the Hindus and Muslims are  over,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.430
now others have picked up fighting.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.630
It means we are also very quarrelsome.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.330
At least in the other countries

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.330
one does not find religions of so many countries in one place.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.600
But, at the slightest opportunity we pick up  fights here.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.130
Fighting becomes the priority.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.430
Fights between husband and wife, then within their children

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.000
and also amongst them who are in contact with each other.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.500
What is Sahaja Yoga?

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.200
Sahaja Yoga is love. Love.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.030
Awaken that power of love that is within you.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.600
Today is supposed to be a very auspicious day.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:13.330
We have to light the lamps in our hearts and make it certain by all means

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.700
that, even if we have to die, we won’t tell lies.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.000
We already have such people with us.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.000
But, our reputation across the world is so much damaged claiming

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.930
that Indians have become dishonest.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.630
Well, I have never come across one atleast,

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.360
but when discussed, I feel very sad.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.430
A holy place like India

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.160
where great saints had taken their birth

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.530
unlike any other place. Sufis were also born here.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.700
all those who became great had been from India only.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:53.060
No other countries ever had so many great souls.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.600
A few may have been there,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.260
but we have had several great souls here.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.160
But, later even after ignoring whatever they might have taught us,

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.260
we became branded thieves.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:17.330
So whoever cheats people they can never ascend to heaven.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.260
Compaired to the lifespan spent here,

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.260
one has to spend a lifespans that is thousand times more in hell.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.060
The reason I am speaking about hell

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.400
on this day is only because hell means the darkness

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.460
and that is the hell that we witness.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.230
Now your lamps are lit. In that light, you must

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.590
recognize the kinds of hell.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.060
You should support the government.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.000
Extend help to identify ,who are dishonest. You may be in a junior or a senior

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.600
position, but you must speak it out

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.330
as to who are the culprits.Catch the culprits.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.630
Expose those who are liars.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.460
Now you have the powers with you – for  what purpose? You are awakened,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.500
for what purpose? You are enlightened.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.360
In  that light, you must see yourself.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.430
In darkness we acheive nothing, but

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.230
watch in your own light to realize what you are.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.100
Also by lying  what are you going to achieve?

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.300
I am a housewife.I have never lied. Never ever. Neither can ever.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:43.400
The moment you are compelled to lie,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.400
you have the powers within, you are all lamps.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.600
You just see them in this darkness.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:56.130
You are the lamps

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.560
and the lamps are supposed to give light.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.630
We have to wipe out this darkness.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.460
There is a bad reputation about us from far across.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.500
While the fact is , nowhere else you will ever find people like that of our country.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.500
It gives great pain when I learn

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.360
what misconceptions the people have about us.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.660
God knows what does one achieve by dishonesty?

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.300
But whatever may be the outcome, it is horrible.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.130
No one will be spared.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.200
Whoever has become dishonest will be caught.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.660
There are all arrangements for that.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.000
You have got your Realization because you are not dishonest.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.460
You love truth and respect the truth.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.930
I want that you should stand on truth.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:51.600
Now for example,people throw garbage into the river Yamuna.It is stupidity.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.960
Yamunaji itself descends directly to hell,

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:04.060
but you will be saved from that hell since

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.460
you are realized souls.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.130
One who has the light generally do not fall.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:20.230
But, if you sincerly want to establish Sahaja Yoga fully within yourself,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.130
then in the beginning, you have to swear that you

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.200
will never commit dishonesty of any kind.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.500
It seems earning money has become the only means of business left out in this world.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.230
What does one get out of it?

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.460
Nobody even remembers them.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.600
If you love your country, then at first you must establish the truth

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:50.530
or else who can trust the liar?

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.160
It is a big hurdle for you

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.660
because you always have a feeling that when my neighbour is like this

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.630
then why  I too don't become like that?

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.900
But,  why don’t you think instead when I can belike this,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.460
then why not transform my neighbour likewise?

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:11.460
First of all, today you must promise that we shall neither

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.630
commit any dishonesty nor support any dishonest person.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:29.000
Falsehood in our country, not sure why, but

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.500
seems like a curse on us.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.030
There are several people who would not be  satisfied until they utter

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.300
at least ten lies from morning until evening.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.900
Now your poverty is finished. Everything is quite all right.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.200
All food and stuff are available.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.360
None of you are beggars, yet why do you lie?

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.700
So let this be the resolution of the day

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.530
that you will not lie any more and, if anyone is a liar then

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.960
we shall not join hands to rejoice with that person.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.630
We will have no relationship with him.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.630
There  is plenty of joy in it.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:13.900
Because, do you know that a liar will go to hell

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.530
and you too will follow him from behind.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.460
God has given you Realization.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:24.300
You have the light within and in that light you should identify the

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.060
other like-minded people and then must

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.630
decide that we will not lie whatever may come,

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.430
even if we are beheaded.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:43.060
In these  matters I know the Indians are very good.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.130
But when I hear certain comments about them outside

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.900
then  I feel very sad.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.400
For example, the road that is constructed,

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.460
does it resemble a road by any means?

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.500
I felt if I was travelling in the jungles.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:04.530
Whenever you come across such a thing, you have

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.460
an organization; you must collectively inquire as to

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.900
who were responsible for the construction? Why it had to be constructed that way?

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.230
Who had consumed the money? All the Sahaja Yogis should get united

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:29.930
and try focussing your attention in that  direction to drive out the bhoots

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.530
out which have crept into India. Wherever you go,you will hear people commenting:

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.500
“Brothers, don’t believe in the Indians." What a shame.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.430
The irony is: in who one should

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.330
trust the most are we Indians only. Nevertheless, we had so many of them

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.060
who were great leaders, great people and great souls.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.460
But we have completely ignored them and their great fame of past.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.000
How much amount of respect people had for them and also they have for you too – I know that.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.530
But you should never extend company or support to the cheats.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.330
The moment you realize that a certain person is a cheat,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.030
then even avoid having meals at his home.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.300
It will become very difficult for the cheats to survive.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.000
I am telling you that

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.600
you  all are the police force of God.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:36.230
Keep track of all those cheats that you come across.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.430
Try to instill courage in your children.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.430
If one is doing something wrong or lying, identify them.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:51.460
This country has received blessings alongwith many other saints.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:57.460
and you all are saints.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.500
There is no need for you to lie.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.360
Well, what's going to happen if you have one time meal only?

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.160
Nobody dies if one doesnot have a meal.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.460
We do have food

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.500
but they prefer drink alcohol.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:17.060
By drinking alcohol, we take a step further towards our own destruction.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.200
If there is alcohol

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.960
we can never be all right.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.300
Now for example, in America,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.030
they always come up with newer subjects,

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.460
Like the moment their children turns sixteen

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.260
they become worthless. Does this mean that  they are all like servants?

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.930
When they work or wash cars they are paid for it.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.460
And what they claim as they attain the age of sixteen?

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.960
“Well, now that we have turned sixteen and so it is the time to go out for a living.”

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.300
I have seen this happening with the

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.200
poor children of sixteen everywhere,

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.300
whereas we (in India) think, “He is just turning sixteen,

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.200
where will he go or What should he study?”

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.360
But,(in America) since he has turned sixteen years of age,

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:12.300
he is driven out of the home both by his mother and father.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.160
Just keep on watching for how long is this going to last with the Americans?

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.000
They are in the state of destruction.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.300
Nobody becomes great by buying one or two airplanes.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:29.460
Where do you think you are? How far are your limitations?

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.530
India is such a country that it can save the entire world

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:47.130
– the entire world. But there should be truthfulness in it.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.300
It is very essential to imbibe the truthfulness. Truthfulness in each and every matter.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.630
I can’t understand, What is the need for nurturing falsehood?

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.860
people who are rich should realize in the begining itself that they are already rich.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:06.060
So it is better for them to sit back quietly and stop planning to earn anymore.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:12.000
I am yet to see Who is happy

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.130
by earning lots of money?

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:23.960
You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have the light within you.

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:29.430
In the light you lead other and the path is of truth.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.160
May you be a Muslim, a Hindu or a Christian. It makes no difference.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.000
You all are humans. And if honesty is missing in a person,

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.430
then he is dishonest. No one will recognize him.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.630
We have to spend lifespan even beyond this also. How will that be?

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.300
Through honesty there can be several benefits.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.200
The greatest of all is that

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.000
you have the blessings of God on you.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.430
Blessings come in such a manner that

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.160
you will be astonished to know

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.100
that everything are effortlessly accomplished on its own.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.300
But now in India, everyone runs after money

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.030
whether they have or donot have.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.260
Yet, there are many poor around.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.930
That is why today Diwali should be for them also.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.030
They too should be happy.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.830
We are citizens of that country.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.260
But we deceive ourselves only. We pose to be  very clever.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.230
By this, ego develops within us. And when ego is developed,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:49.030
nobody can save by any means.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.300
With ego, you will develop cancer.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.030
Therefore you will not be able to save yourself

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.160
if you develop cancer. You cannot save yourself.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.400
I cannot save you. I am telling you the truth.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.930
So, first of all , you should burn the ego in fire that you possess within .

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.900
If you have ego then you must be ashamed of it.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.160
“Ego for what"?

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.060
It is prevelent for everything in our country .

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:24.560
Someone passes a Bachelor degree examination,  he develops ego.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.000
Achieving someother  qualification higher than that gives him double ego.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.000
One achieves something,

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.000
becomes an engineer or a doctor,

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.030
he develops ego.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.530
Thus, when this Agnya chakra gets caught,

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:45.030
where does it ultimately lead you to? To hell.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.160
And hell is a very horrible place.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.560
God has blessed you with intelligence

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.130
and now you have got your Realization.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:02.360
Still if you want to go to the hell, you can go.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:38:05.030
It is only when you remain honest and

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.360
Until this day nobody spoke about it or told you.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:12.000
Today is the day that is considered auspicious

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.500
because several good things happened.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.100
During the period of Ramachandraji, Sitaji returned home.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:27.960
During Krishna’s times and several other occasion that were marked by great events

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.630
were all worked out by the realized souls.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.260
That is why, in the first place, you must take a vow today that

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.900
“We will not commit any dishonesty for sure

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:44.130
and if anyone does, then we shall ensure

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.400
that he is caught.”

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.000
But I notice that in this country the blacks are at war with the whites

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.430
any one picking up fight with the other.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.360
They want to divide India into fragments.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.100
It is not going to benefit anyway. But how is it going to benefit?

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.130
you possess a good moral character.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.030
Whatever you have learnt from the English,

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.230
there was nothing worth learning from them.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.930
They are all in a bad state these days.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.500
But we have to save our own country

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.560
and also to save the entire world. It is a great responsibility.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.800
You have been realized and the light has come within you.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:37.160
Yet, you want to jump into the ditch,what can anyone do?

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.000
Everyone should join together to make an effort.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.260
I want the Sahaja Yogis should constitute a committee.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.200
In case you come across any cheating,

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.230
you should report it to the committee.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.400
Then let us see what the committee does.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.300
In this way, you'll earn a good name.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.000
In this way, you will be elevated to higher positions.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.230
So, in the first place neither you be a dishonest yourself

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:10.360
nor let any other be.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.030
This is very important for you have

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.530
great blemish on your country.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.360
There is adulteration in the edible oil,

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:22.030
adulteration in the ghee.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.300
Everywhere  people make a mockery at us.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.260
No one has faith in us.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.700
In fact, the best of the people are in India.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:40.630
Nowhere you find so many people

00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:40.700
who have had their realization.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.500
They have not earned any sort of punyas(virtues/spiritual merits).

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.930
Therefore, it is nobler to earn punyas than to earn money.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:56.430
Look at those people who are very poor.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:02.400
So today is a very auspicious day and also a day of joy.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:08.060
Joy for what? Because on this day we have been blessed

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.430
with heaven and we desire to be in heaven only.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.360
But cowards can never make it to heaven.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.700
There is no need to be afraid.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.460
Well, what diaster is going to come even if you earn

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.530
a few paise(Indian currency coin) less or more?

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.160
All of you have become rich. I can see that is quite visible and

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.900
I have been coming here(Delhi) for the past 17 or 18 years now.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.360
All of you have become richer than before.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.200
Conditions have improved now compared to earlier.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.700
But, from morning until evening there is

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.200
dishonesty, dishonesty and dishonesty.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:52.750
So, the path is now laid down before you. therefore,just promise today

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.000
that we shall not commit any dishonesty and, if anyone is found doing

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:01.660
then we shall collectively oppose him.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.460
Why did Sahaja Yoga

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.700
give you Realization?

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.160
It is because you will emit light.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:15.120
If you do not posses light within, then how can you emit light outside?

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.360
In that light try to see for yourself whether you are helping the dishonest?

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:25.260
Nothing happens if you earn a little less or more.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.060
If you are honest, then God helps you.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.550
Now , you see for yourself , I never take money from anyone.It is true.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:37.980
But, I wrote a book

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.770
and received lots of money from it.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.900
I shall neither allow anyone to take anything.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.500
Why do so many people die in our country

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.060
compared to anywhere else?

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:58.900
The reason is because people want to go to hell.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.600
So, you should know this, that if you commit dishonesty,

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.860
then your first step have already been established in hell

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:12.660
and secondly you don’t need to utter lies at all.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:16.000
You must speak the truth.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:24.030
The man who speaks the truth becomes a unique person.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:30.130
If he practises Sahaja Yoga, then it can be remarkable.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.380
As you are remembering the Sufis today,

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.930
similarly people will remember you then.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.710
You don’t need to do anything

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.310
only expose those who are dishonest.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.340
It is important.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.000
Here the people are querreling...

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.940
"Don't throw garbage into the Yamunaji and

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.210
don’t throw that". Now, do this also needs to be told.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.010
I have been to so many countries.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:01.150
Nowhere the waste is disposed into any river.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:06.640
Then why are you so lazy? There are so many facilities made available.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:13.420
You can hand it over to the municipality or dispose it elsewhere.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.700
But if you are accumulating the waste yourself,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.950
then what can you do?

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:24.250
All of you should think in your mind and decide today.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.810
It is a very good day today. It is a good day.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:34.640
That neither  shall we ever commit any dishonesty nor acknowledge the dishonest.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.820
I have seen such people

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:42.260
who neither had been dishonest nor ever visited the house

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.050
of any dishonest person. They never kept any connection with them.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:48.910
because they not only harmed themselves

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.800
but had also been harmful for the nation..

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.200
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.280
You should promise that

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:01.360
we shall never commit any dishonesty.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.280
And if some one happens to be dishonest

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.480
then you must beat him collectively.Don't worry.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:23.130
For that you need not think "why to beat him, there is government to look after".

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.840
It doesn't matter.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:30.310
You have to recognize only who are dishonest

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:38.010
and tell it to your inner Sprit that he is dishonest.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.910
And for the Sahaja Yogis – even if 12 Sahaja Yogis can unite and collectively

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.750
identify that this particular person is dishonest,

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:51.210
then God is with you.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:59.250
Merely by a handful of rich people the welfare of  the country cannot improve.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.110
But with honest people, certainly it can.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.750
So, the greatest blemish on us is

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.650
that 'we are dishonest'.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:18.710
- What? - (inturruption addressing Sir CP)

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:29.060
And those who are Sahaja Yogis can never be dishonest by any means.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.580
This is My belief.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:39.750
We all need to be united.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.940
Leave aside all differences.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:48.820
We are all honest people, India’s reputation is greatly tarnished.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.210
That is why take a vow from today

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.050
that we shall not commit any dishonesty and if there are

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.450
any other dishonest person, we shall collectively chase after him.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.930
He is sure to experience a sleepless night the next day itself.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:15.350
Nevertheless, it has gone too far.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.780
Now I've to tell you that I am astonished.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.280
There is dishonesty in everything – dishonesty in everything.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:27.890
Where ever you notice any dishonesty,

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.700
Sahaja yogis should unite in group of ten to beat him.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.010
I am with you!

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:45.880
In the earlier days people used to outcast others on petty matters.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:51.040
- 'What's the matter'?(Interruption...Mother discussing aside).

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.380
They used to outcast

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.870
and boycott on every minute issue.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:05.700
But, our country had remained so honest and

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:09.680
had such great qualities.Why have we forgotten them?

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:13.850
Where have they all gone?

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:21.910
I find there is dishonesty everywhere. Dishonesty at every step.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.600
If you notice anyone practsing dishonesty  - then go and beat him.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:36.670
But it doesn't mean that you beat every other person who comes your way.It doesnot mean that.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:48.410
You must teach the children here that they should not become dishonest.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.180
In case they are dying of starvation

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.450
then  arrangements could be made suitably,

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.250
provided they are honest.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:06.010
But if honesty is not there,leave alone God,

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.810
no one is going to help you. All kinds of diseases will come upon you.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:14.280
Coincidently, our country is full of such remarkable traditions, they are countless...

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.910
For example, they will drink alcohol,liquor just imagine!

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:27.380
Were you born to become a stupid?

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:33.990
Stop being friendly to the person, who does it. Don’t support him.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.520
I have noticed that people who

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:43.850
drink alcohol,people visit their houses and

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.810
they also join in drinking alcohol. But if you come to know

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.680
that a person is of such nature...

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:52.350
or a particular person is dishonest, then stop having meals in his house.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:57.650
You should not have any concern (for them).

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.450
We have to work for the betterment of our country

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.710
because god has given us the light.You must judge in that light.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.710
His powers are tremendous.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:15.850
If you are able to realize that those who had been dishonest

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:21.030
to the nation will be taken care of by God.That will work out everything. It is enough.

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:26.210
But, you seem to have turn deaf and refuse to understand.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:29.680
Such people neither can ever do good

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:32.480
nor can ever deliver.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:38.550
I don’t understand how do those shameless people exist? I really donot know.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.120
But, they do exist.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:46.150
For that reason, today's message for you is

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.910
that you must vow on this day onwards

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.590
that we shall never ever commit any dishonesty

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:57.030
and if someone is dishonest, then we shall not support him.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.720
That is enough.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:21.970
Many more realized souls will come to our country.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:26.970
But, who would like to be born in such a dishonest country like this?

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.350
The only message for you today is that you have the light within

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:49.450
and you have carry forward your mission in that light

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.130
that is going to provide you the strength.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.810
Whatever you wish to do, you are welcome.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:03.150
Look, we have achieved our 'swatantrata'.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.750
'Swa'-'tantra'...try to know the 'swa'(ownSelf).

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:10.810
It's for you...( inturruptions- in-betweenlittle child hands over flowers to Mother)

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:19.220
Now, I want that many children to be born. They should be realized.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:28.780
That is why you must learn in the begining.....

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:34.510
Today is a great day.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:44.340
You must promise today that neither will we commit any dishonesty nor be involved with the dishonest persons.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.470
or be afraid of them.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.580
God is never with them. God is with you.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:52:02.820
If you are good, then God is with you.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:07.110
Everyone of you were born in this land of India, it indeed wasn't for the sake of

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.850
fighting amongst each other to die.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:17.130
Ignorant fools, we fight each other and then die.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.850
There is no use in fighting, you should tell this to people.

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.990
“Well, what are you fighting for ?

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.770
What do you want? Why? After all, what do you want?

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:34.250
There is enough to eat and drink. What more do you want?”

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.700
But, nowadays the demands are like ,

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.410
“I need that dress, I want such kind of house

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:45.210
and not this type.”

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.630
And with all those, let's go to hell.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.860
At this moment...(Inturrupted by Sir CP and speaking to Sir CP)

00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:02.280
(Sir) OK, enough, that'll do.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.060
- No-no, Its all fine......

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:27.910
Like those who had become Sufis, you are all Sufis too

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.520
because you have been cleansed.

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:37.630
Now all of you should write poems – on honesty.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.950
This element of dishonesty needs to go in the first place

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:49.340
and secondly, there are many issues that need to be taken care of.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:54.130
But first of all, never commit dishonesty.

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:59.600
No one is that poor in India

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:04.340
that he needs to take to dishonesty.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.640
- What?(speaking aside)

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:14.780
What I am saying is, there is a blemish on our country and it needs to be wiped out.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.700
And you are Sahaja Yogis. You can do it.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:23.490
You have the light with you. With it

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.810
you can spread the light everywhere.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:34.930
You must encourage everyone to show the  right things.

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.260
Those young amongst you, who are friends

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:42.680
should think what honestful work they can undertake.

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:46.700
Now a campaign is initiated  to prohibit dumping anything into River Yamunaj.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:51.760
That is all right, but it is not as important.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:54.290
More important aspect is losing one's honesty.

00:54:55.220 --> 00:55:01.270
That is why this day is considered auspicious everywhere.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.330
Lamps are lit at all the places.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:09.650
Everything is done and if we can’t do this bit,

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:13.370
then there is no use being a sahaj yogi.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:22.430
We have the  largest collectivity of Sahaja Yogis in India – the largest collectivity.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.650
Next to it is in Russia.

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:33.180
Now, the Russians are very humble.

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:36.290
they dont steal or cheat

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.530
I really don’t understand how?

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.810
Maybe if communism comes here,probably

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:44.750
we too would become like them.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:48.820
But it does not make very big sense.

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.930
It is not good to impose compulsion to achieve anything..

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.160
Let us impose strictness on ourselves.

00:55:56.270 --> 00:56:00.930
Decide it for good. Take up the resolution today only.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.190
Today is a very good day to start,

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:09.370
that neither shall we commit any dishonesty nor let others commit it.

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:17.750
Your country will become very prosperous.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:23.340
And after all what is any other country? I have seen all of them.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:26.270
All are useless people.

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:32.780
But,people of our country still have a lot of dharma(righteousness) in them.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.080
The dharma in our country has been destroyed

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:42.010
since the dishonest became all the very powerful.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:50.140
Try to find out whether someone is dishonest and then make advances for picketting on him.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.130
You are so many, you must gather together for picketting on him.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.530
- What..?(Mother speaking aside)

00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:01.050
and that would make a lot of difference.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:07.420
- Haan!, Well , better you don't interrupt me in-between... (speaking to Sir CP)

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.080
So the only  message today is

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:25.790
that neither we shall ever commit dishonesty nor allow anyothers to commit.

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:31.580
But the people here are very tolerant in this matter.

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.970
They tolerate. This is the greatest mistake.

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:39.980
When you have got the light, then why do you fear?

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.710
What is the reason for you to be afraid?

00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:53.650
That is why I am requesting you today to do everything with courage.

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.780
And now you have got a kind of swatantrata (freedom).

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:01.440
You will attain (knowledge) the tantra (the system) of the swa (Self).

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:03.300
You have already attained it,

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:08.180
but try to make use of it.

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.810
Today so many of you have gathered here.

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.950
I had never seen so many in Delhi before.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:29.570
Therefore,today every one of you must decide in mind

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:34.310
that we will not accept any dishonest person at all.And the rakshasas too incarnate at this time due to these reasons.

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.810
Doesn't it go to show that we too have certain weaknesses within.

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.780
That 's why  they believe that the weaknesses within us,

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:46.150
will ultimately compel us to accept them.

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:49.950
Indians should never accept them.

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:57.880
Besides the persons who have received their Realization , should never ever accept them.

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:01.160
There is a bad reputation about our country everywhere.

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.560
But this is not true.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.950
There are several persons in India who are honest – in great number.

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:10.810
Nevertheless, it is not true

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:14.780
but I have seen it Myself that

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:22.310
they will quarrel amongst each other saying,“This land is mine and that land is yours.”

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:26.910
Well whatever is yours is 'Swaraj'.

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.750
It is the 'rajya' (kingdom) of the 'swa' (Self).

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:32.410
Swaraj can only happen

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.680
when you really become 'swatantra' in the true sense.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:45.010
There is no need to be afraid of anyone. There is no need to tell anything to anyone.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:52.110
I am astonished to see so many people.

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:54.310
I had never seen so many people in My life.

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:10.930
So, I have only one request to you and that is today,

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.660
on this occasion of a very auspicious day,

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.520
decide that we shall never commit dishonesty even if we have to die.

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:25.970
secondly,if there is any dishonest, then collectively take care of him.

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:33.750
By the way I told you all these things. But it seems the government is not able to do anything.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.850
In the  last 10 years our country deteriorated a lot .

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:47.050
You all are  Sahaja Yogis and  so many in numbers. Who are you all afraid of?

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.650
What is the reason to fear?

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:58.230
God is there behind everyone, to support.

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:08.730
Just see for yourself, as soon as the Sufis realized

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.350
that God was behind them,

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:16.520
they got rid of all those unwanted things that were around them

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.110
– not all, but a few of the sufis.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.150
That is what  you all should do.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:29.550
In My opinion, the only message for today is that

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.910
now  neither you are a cheat yourself, nor will help any cheat.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.900
I have been reading in the papers that

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:45.300
there are differences over several other issues.

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.010
Differences are over the caste and creed.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:55.530
Well, are your efforts for protecting the country or for drowning ?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.250
You have a great responsibility on you.

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.730
You are born in the Kali Yuga.

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:06.830
That is why this Kali Yuga is to be transformed

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.910
and you are all realized in the thousands.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.980
Nowhere else have so many people been realized on Earth.

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:21.170
That is why time and again I shall be repeating to you

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:24.940
to stand on truth. I am with you.

01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:39.180
And God is also with you.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.850
I was never worried about money.

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:52.350
I've lived without money only, I don't need them.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.730
I have so many children, what shall I do with money?

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:13.900
So I have a request to you all today to assert within yourself

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:18.620
that we shall not allow any offences like cheating or stealing to happen.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.670
Wherever we come to know of it, we will fight it out there.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.590
I do not know what the people achieve by drinking alcohol or doing what?

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:40.100
But in this light what do you receive? It is 'Courage'!

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.760
so fight with courage!

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:46.220
Whatever are wrong with this country should be removed.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.810
It has earned a very bad reputation.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.150
There are many more issues,

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.310
but the most important one is that when there is no honesty at all,

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.180
how is God going to help you?

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:08.030
To earn money is not the help from God, but to be established in dharma is.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:14.420
There aren’t as many Sahaja Yogis anywhere else as you find here.

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:18.810
Further,Sahaja Yogis never involve themselves doing such activities also.

01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:21.360
But I am telling you all this because

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.060
the atmosphere here is bad.

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:32.110
Over and above we have earned such a bad name all over.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:37.090
You have everything with you - food to eat and drink, clothes to wear.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.560
What else do you need?

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:50.200
You may enjoy movies, you enjoy that, you do have that much money.

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:57.380
But first of all, the obsession for the money should be got rid of.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:05.100
I have full faith in you that you will listen to My today's lecture carefully.

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:11.220
And let us take an oath today

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:18.400
that we shall not commit dishonesty at all, also will oppose them who commits.

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:36.090
The most important message that is to be understood

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:41.680
is that today our country needs honesty .

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:48.190
Nothing is more important than that. Your Mother stands for honesty.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:56.440
Fighting against Muslims,fighting with others, Ther is no need to fight with anybody.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:05.090
Let us fight within ourselves with us. That is all.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:08.150
All are good.

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:12.140
So what if you have only one shirt instead of ten?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.730
Likewise convince these things to women also.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.380
It will work out.... It will happen.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:28.410
Today’s speech is a little bit different. It is unique...

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:34.480
and you all have liked it. It was very kind of you.

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:58.740
Let's go.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.010
Well then, thank you.
