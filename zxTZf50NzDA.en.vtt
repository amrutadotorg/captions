00:49.280 --> 01:11.619
Advice to Sahaja Yogis
on Hygiene and other Topics

01:11.619 --> 01:26.510
Alpe Motta, Italy
May 4, 1986

01:26.510 --> 01:36.190
These are the songs they are sung in Himalayas,
and to be sung here is something really remarkable,

01:36.190 --> 01:37.190
isn’t it?

01:37.190 --> 01:40.240
You brought it all the way to be sung here.

01:40.240 --> 01:49.870
Now, I think I have already given you a very,
very long lecture and a speech as you call

01:49.870 --> 02:00.270
it, but some reactions were very good, and
some could absorb it very well.

02:00.270 --> 02:03.579
But some, they said, were sleeping.

02:03.579 --> 02:07.680
Now these things happen because of negativity.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.970
You have to fight your negativity, because
negativity is the thing that asks questions.

02:12.970 --> 02:19.890
When I am talking I am telling the truth,
absolute truth, but it asks questions and

02:19.890 --> 02:21.390
it reflects.

02:21.390 --> 02:26.690
When it starts reflecting, nothing goes in
the head because you are left with the past

02:26.690 --> 02:29.680
sentence, and the present you are not with
it.

02:29.680 --> 02:39.010
So the whole thing boils down to something
like an escape, and then you escape and you

02:39.010 --> 02:40.010
sleep off.

02:40.010 --> 02:43.209
I mean, I tried My level best today to put
you onto your conscious mind.

02:43.209 --> 02:51.340
You have to be conscious, you have to be alert;
and that’s the point, is that unless and

02:51.340 --> 02:54.440
until you are conscious you cannot ascend.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.760
Any abnormal person cannot ascend.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.950
You have to normalize yourself.

03:01.950 --> 03:09.900
So many of you had lots of abnormalities which
were brought out and thrown away, and many

03:09.900 --> 03:16.269
have been cleansed, but now if there are some
still lingering with it, they must work it

03:16.269 --> 03:17.269
out.

03:17.269 --> 03:20.739
They cannot just go on justifying it.

03:20.739 --> 03:26.400
Normally negative persons attract a negative
personality.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.370
So if you have such a negativity of any kind
within you, you should never sit next to a

03:30.370 --> 03:32.640
negative person, never go near such a person.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.730
Keep away, but stick on to the positive person.

03:35.730 --> 03:45.290
Like I said, stick on and support your leaders
without question, without questioning.

03:45.290 --> 03:48.900
But this is the trouble is that you start
fighting your own leader.

03:48.900 --> 03:53.769
If the leader says something to you, you quarrel
with the leader and you argue with the leader,

03:53.769 --> 03:55.430
so it’s finished.

03:55.430 --> 03:59.849
I speak through the leaders, so you don’t
question it.

03:59.849 --> 04:05.760
If you question it, then there will be a problem.

04:05.760 --> 04:11.030
You have to stick on with your leaders, who
are positive people.

04:11.030 --> 04:16.599
And if you start questioning them, then you
will be nowhere – no link between you and

04:16.599 --> 04:21.430
Me.

04:21.430 --> 04:27.910
And this is everywhere: I was told in Switzerland
it is like this, in France now is better but

04:27.910 --> 04:33.570
used to be like that; everywhere, except for
Italy – I think Italy has the best results.

04:33.570 --> 04:37.979
So don’t fight with your leaders, don’t
argue them.

04:37.979 --> 04:42.340
Do not reflect about Sahaja Yoga – what
can you say, what do you know, how can you

04:42.340 --> 04:44.870
reflect?

04:44.870 --> 04:47.740
What is your knowledge?

04:47.740 --> 04:54.260
Do you question your chemistry teacher when
he says hydrogen has got two atoms or one

04:54.260 --> 04:55.260
atom?

04:55.260 --> 05:00.120
Do you?

05:00.120 --> 05:09.390
And when you start doing this with your ego,
you are thrown out of the realm of evolution.

05:09.390 --> 05:13.690
So do not reflect, just listen, and try to
take it inside.

05:13.690 --> 05:16.530
These are all mantras; take them inside.

05:16.530 --> 05:21.501
Instead of that you start questioning, arguing
with your leaders, giving them advices.

05:21.501 --> 05:25.139
Please don’t do it – stop it now.

05:25.139 --> 05:33.710
This is not politics, where everybody can
advise, everybody has to say something.

05:33.710 --> 05:40.000
Mostly the bhoots are such; the bhootish people
go on advising and having their own say.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.110
And they go against the leader throughout.

05:43.110 --> 05:47.310
Now specially for the elderly people, I would
say, because you are more grown up sometimes

05:47.310 --> 05:48.940
than the leaders are.

05:48.940 --> 05:52.650
Then you think you have a right to correct
your leaders – it’s not so.

05:52.650 --> 06:01.170
In Sahaja Yoga it is not how much you are
old, but it is how much you are evolved.

06:01.170 --> 06:07.470
So when you start questioning your leaders
and reflecting on their behavior or anything

06:07.470 --> 06:15.160
like that, and answering them back or also
giving your ideas, you are gone.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.080
It’s like a link.

06:17.080 --> 06:27.240
Say, there’s a link between the chakras
and the cells, say it like that.

06:27.240 --> 06:37.370
Now if you deny the chakras, how one has to
work it out; because I am connected with them,

06:37.370 --> 06:42.250
and through them you are connected.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.780
But when you deny them, then you fall out.

06:45.780 --> 06:51.229
I know what to do with the leaders, I choose
them, I arrange them, I organize them, I change

06:51.229 --> 06:52.880
them; I know what to do.

06:52.880 --> 06:57.639
Now you people do not challenge them – is
nothing but your ego.

06:57.639 --> 07:01.630
In India it doesn’t happen at all, doesn’t
happen.

07:01.630 --> 07:05.980
Once Mother has appointed somebody it’s
accepted, because for them this is the truth

07:05.980 --> 07:08.419
that they have been seeking.

07:08.419 --> 07:13.091
The all other is nonsense, is all complications;
and because you are so complicated, to you

07:13.091 --> 07:18.530
other things look nice, you think you’re
surrendering your personalities – not at

07:18.530 --> 07:19.889
all.

07:19.889 --> 07:26.060
Is developing, surrendering yourself to the
sap of life, to the vitality, to the vital

07:26.060 --> 07:27.680
force of life.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.120
Surrender, accept more, accept more.

07:30.120 --> 07:38.820
This ego can never allow you to take inside
anything – be careful on that.

07:38.820 --> 07:43.080
This will never allow you to sleep, this will
never give you peace.

07:43.080 --> 07:47.090
It will never allow you to grow, it will never
take you to your own goal.

07:47.090 --> 07:51.770
So surrender that your ego of yours.

07:51.770 --> 07:56.229
So one thing I have to tell you: don’t fight,
don’t quarrel, don’t question, don’t

07:56.229 --> 08:06.270
reflect about your leaders to begin with;
or otherwise you will be cut off.

08:06.270 --> 08:09.160
Keep in his good book, try to support him.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.330
Ask him what does he want, what help he needs.

08:12.330 --> 08:19.742
The more you get attached to him, the more
you get closer to him, the more you will get.

08:19.742 --> 08:26.039
But you see, people are very wasteful.

08:26.039 --> 08:30.770
They have wasted their lives in drugs, this,
that, all nonsense.

08:30.770 --> 08:35.300
And the women have another bad habit, is to
gossip.

08:35.300 --> 08:40.610
They want to gossip: gossip about this person,
criticize that person.

08:40.610 --> 08:46.199
It’s a very bad habit of women to gossip.

08:46.199 --> 08:52.770
I never pay heed to anyone who gossips, and
I don’t like a person who gossips.

08:52.770 --> 08:58.610
So don’t gossip about things – cheaply,
frivolously talking about others.

08:58.610 --> 09:03.170
It’s not necessary you should be educated,
it’s not necessary that you should come

09:03.170 --> 09:08.199
from a very well-bred family, nothing is necessary;
as long as you are a Sahaja yogi, you can

09:08.199 --> 09:11.120
be a diamond.

09:11.120 --> 09:15.650
But allow yourself to be cut into the diamond.

09:15.650 --> 09:18.080
Allow!

09:18.080 --> 09:23.940
So the reaction of some people was very good,
they absorbed what I said, they took everything

09:23.940 --> 09:26.130
inside; but some of them went off to sleep.

09:26.130 --> 09:31.670
Now, if those who were struggling at that
time may not have understood – it’s a

09:31.670 --> 09:35.130
difficult subject, I told you, it’s a very
subtle subject, doesn’t matter.

09:35.130 --> 09:42.591
But those who have been like that should look
after themselves, should find out.

09:42.591 --> 09:49.360
I’ve found out one thing with the left-sided
people: if they can put a candle near their

09:49.360 --> 09:55.210
left Swadisthana, a little far, and put one
candle before the photograph, and put left

09:55.210 --> 10:01.930
hand towards the photograph and right hand
on the Mother Earth, it works.

10:01.930 --> 10:06.220
And the candle at the back should be kept
a little far away because it makes sounds,

10:06.220 --> 10:09.089
it goes this way, that way, burns.

10:09.089 --> 10:14.860
Those who have been taking drugs, not LSD
but other drugs, which are drowsy people who

10:14.860 --> 10:22.970
feel sleepy, whose brains are destroyed by
drug, all those people can benefit a lot by

10:22.970 --> 10:23.970
this.

10:23.970 --> 10:27.790
Do it every day.

10:27.790 --> 10:34.900
Going into drug you never felt you’re surrendered
to drugs, never felt that way – which was

10:34.900 --> 10:37.770
something that was going to kill you completely.

10:37.770 --> 10:41.980
You know how so many people are killed, so
many are dying, but you wanted to do that,

10:41.980 --> 10:44.440
I don’t know, because your ego said, “All
right, go ahead, try this.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.510
You will be the one who nothing will happen
to you.”

10:47.510 --> 10:50.030
That’s the ego suggests.

10:50.030 --> 10:51.030
So you did it.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.530
All right, doesn’t matter.

10:52.530 --> 11:03.060
Whatever has happened has happened, let us
clear it out, because we are seekers.

11:03.060 --> 11:12.860
So those who have really felt one in the lecture,
without any questioning, should know that

11:12.860 --> 11:14.600
they are doing well.

11:14.600 --> 11:20.480
Those who were questioning, reflecting, should
know they have ego, and those who were dozing

11:20.480 --> 11:26.110
out should know that they are left-sided.

11:26.110 --> 11:32.089
Left side is worse than the right side, because
the right side can be easily corrected: it

11:32.089 --> 11:34.190
shows, it shows outside.

11:34.190 --> 11:36.290
People don’t like it.

11:36.290 --> 11:40.280
Such a person is criticized, everybody says
he’s egoistical, he’s this, that.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.580
Everybody knows that such a person goes out
like Hitler.

11:43.580 --> 11:49.010
But the left-sided person, you see, is very
pitiable and you’ll have very great pity

11:49.010 --> 11:52.400
for such a person and you sympathize, and
you get lost with that person.

11:52.400 --> 12:00.950
They are more dangerous, and difficult to
be cured, very difficult.

12:00.950 --> 12:04.060
So it’s not a easy task, you have to work
it out.

12:04.060 --> 12:05.549
I am trying My level best.

12:05.549 --> 12:09.620
You should also help Me.

12:09.620 --> 12:15.079
I was thinking that if you can start using
a little oil for your head will be a good

12:15.079 --> 12:16.079
idea, in the night.

12:16.079 --> 12:17.490
As Sahaja yogis you should.

12:17.490 --> 12:20.049
I think the hairstyle should be changed for
Sahaja yogis.

12:20.049 --> 12:22.650
This modern fashionable style won’t suit
us.

12:22.650 --> 12:27.480
Because this will, we’ll have all bald heads
one day, I can tell you, and you will see

12:27.480 --> 12:31.120
the Sahasrara with a big dimple here.

12:31.120 --> 12:38.930
Better use some nice coconut oil, rub in your
head nicely, and in the night and in the morning

12:38.930 --> 12:43.820
– after all, it doesn’t show much – and
comb your hair in a proper way.

12:43.820 --> 12:48.380
Because also I think, if your dresses are
like bhoots, your hair are like bhoots then

12:48.380 --> 12:51.660
the bhoots will take over thinking, “Oh,
this is a bhoot sitting down here, I better

12:51.660 --> 12:53.570
take hold of that bhoot.”

12:53.570 --> 12:58.640
So dress up in a way – shouldn’t have
hair on your forehead at all, keep it straight,

12:58.640 --> 13:02.000
make it nice, and have it absolutely clean
foreheads.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.679
We are Sahaja yogis: we have to change our
dresses, we have to change our styles, we

13:06.679 --> 13:14.160
cannot become fashionable like these stupid
punks.

13:14.160 --> 13:21.130
So we are a type, by our hairstyle people
should know that these are Sahaja yogis.

13:21.130 --> 13:25.850
So before you start getting bald, better try
putting some oil in your head.

13:25.850 --> 13:28.319
That’s one very important thing the Sahaja
yogis have to do.

13:28.319 --> 13:34.770
They can take vibrated oil if you like and
I think olive oil is good, but better than

13:34.770 --> 13:42.110
olive oil, I find, it is coconut oil is better
for the growth of the hair.

13:42.110 --> 13:47.699
But sometimes you can also put almond oil,
is also good, almond oil for you; because

13:47.699 --> 13:56.189
if you have any problem that you feel exhausted
or your nerves need attention, you are nervous

13:56.189 --> 13:59.620
type of person, then almond oil is good for
you.

13:59.620 --> 14:06.640
And for people who have teeth which are troubling
them, they must look after them.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.140
No use going to the dentist, because dentists
create problems.

14:10.140 --> 14:18.870
Simple thing is to use olive oil and some
salt, and rub it on your gums nicely every

14:18.870 --> 14:20.150
day before sleeping.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.690
That will keep your teeth all right.

14:21.690 --> 14:25.300
You’ll be amazed, till today I have not
been to any dentist.

14:25.300 --> 14:34.150
Never been to a dentist, and I hope I won’t
go to a dentist.

14:34.150 --> 14:38.880
So, but one thing is that I have certain bad
habits, one of them is that I brush my teeth

14:38.880 --> 14:39.880
quite often.

14:39.880 --> 14:46.770
But don’t use electrical brushes and all
that, but use brushes or use your fingers,

14:46.770 --> 14:54.209
is the best way is to rub with the salt and
the oil, it’s very good for you.

14:54.209 --> 14:57.610
And then allow the whole thing to come out,
and then wash off.

14:57.610 --> 15:05.660
Then the third thing I find in Europe, that
you people do not clear your throats, and

15:05.660 --> 15:09.830
your tongues, which is another thing very
much against Vishuddhi.

15:09.830 --> 15:13.420
And that must be one of the reasons why your
Vishuddhis are bad.

15:13.420 --> 15:20.559
So, though it is not in fashionable here in
the West, but very important thing is to put

15:20.559 --> 15:26.880
your two fingers in the mouth and rub your
– fingers, not the thing, fingers – and

15:26.880 --> 15:31.370
clean your tongue in such a way that everything
comes out in the morning.

15:31.370 --> 15:36.000
Is important, because that accumulates and
then it rots.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.510
So this has to be done.

15:37.510 --> 15:42.809
And may be that you might think that this
is doing, you make a noise and all that, doesn’t

15:42.809 --> 15:43.809
matter.

15:43.809 --> 15:47.470
You have to clear out your throat; I mean,
that’s how you will keep your Vishuddhis

15:47.470 --> 15:48.470
very clear.

15:48.470 --> 15:50.130
This is one of the things.

15:50.130 --> 15:56.059
And another thing is that you must always
use water as much as possible, for washing:

15:56.059 --> 16:00.240
when you go for your morning ablution, water
must be used.

16:00.240 --> 16:06.030
The paper is a very dirty and unhygienic habit,
very dirty and unhygienic habit.

16:06.030 --> 16:09.150
But even if you use paper, you must use water
after that.

16:09.150 --> 16:16.390
It’s very important that all the time the
water should be used as much as possible;

16:16.390 --> 16:21.830
for Sahaja yogis it is a very, very important
thing.

16:21.830 --> 16:32.480
Now for some people who will find that they
are on a subtler level quite on the verge

16:32.480 --> 16:40.260
of collapse, in the way that they still have
those problems that they want to sleep with

16:40.260 --> 16:43.329
other women and they want to do all these
things: they should give up Sahaja Yoga.

16:43.329 --> 16:45.150
Best is to leave us alone.

16:45.150 --> 16:47.809
We can’t have such useless people with us.

16:47.809 --> 16:51.610
So they should give up Sahaja Yoga and don’t
trouble us; because we can get thousands and

16:51.610 --> 16:55.120
thousands in India, we have no problem.

16:55.120 --> 16:59.150
For them it is not difficult, they are already
there.

16:59.150 --> 17:04.020
So those who are still like that, who are
trying to have relations with other women

17:04.020 --> 17:09.431
and having their eyes on other women, and
all the women like that, you see, all this

17:09.431 --> 17:14.260
kind of maniacs – I call them maniacs only
– should give up Sahaja Yoga and should

17:14.260 --> 17:15.720
spare us.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.079
This is for definite.

17:17.079 --> 17:21.110
Now, we have always been saying that those
who are very negative people will have to

17:21.110 --> 17:23.449
leave Sahaja Yoga, and the day will come.

17:23.449 --> 17:29.110
So for all of you it is very necessary that
you should try to clean yourself, and never

17:29.110 --> 17:34.990
sit with a person who is negative.

17:34.990 --> 17:37.440
Never make friendship with a person who is
negative.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.200
Try to be more helpful to a person who is
positive.

17:41.200 --> 17:49.240
Clear out yourself, clean out yourself, look
after yourself, respect yourself, love yourself.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.720
Live with your dignity.

17:51.720 --> 18:00.760
Cheapish thing, frivolous thing, useless thing
should not be done, and make your ego be challenged.

18:00.760 --> 18:04.940
Let somebody insult you and see that, that
you do not answer back.

18:04.940 --> 18:09.560
Just see it, not to get into temper.

18:09.560 --> 18:14.480
Try that your ego doesn’t react.

18:14.480 --> 18:22.780
That can be achieved very easily if you try
in the mirror, look at yourself and laugh

18:22.780 --> 18:25.050
at yourself, make fun of yourself.

18:25.050 --> 18:27.340
What do you think of yourself?

18:27.340 --> 18:28.480
Who are you?

18:28.480 --> 18:30.880
What do you have?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.030
Nothing.

18:32.030 --> 18:40.510
Now today’s lecture was really, was not
only was a great lecture, but also it was

18:40.510 --> 18:44.150
like mantras, all good for the brain.

18:44.150 --> 18:51.280
And I would say that this lecture must be
listened to again and again, and to be taken

18:51.280 --> 18:54.030
in, not to be questioned.

18:54.030 --> 18:58.910
Not to be questioned – to be taken in, to
be absorbed.

18:58.910 --> 19:01.160
I hope that you understand this.

19:01.160 --> 19:09.720
Now after this Sahasrara Puja I hope you people
try to maintain the position you have reached.

19:09.720 --> 19:22.030
I would expect all of you to support, to glorify
your leaders and not in any way debase them,

19:22.030 --> 19:25.020
argue with them, give them ideas.

19:25.020 --> 19:29.100
Even the wives I have said are not to argue
with the leaders.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.910
It’s like pulling each other.

19:32.910 --> 19:39.910
Like they said there were some scorpions sent
for investigation from different places.

19:39.910 --> 19:45.350
And they saw one jar was open, and they said,
“What is this?

19:45.350 --> 19:48.800
This, from this jar all the scorpions will
jump out.”

19:48.800 --> 19:54.840
They said, “They cannot, because one comes
up, the another pulls him down.”

19:54.840 --> 19:58.670
In the same way we behave.

19:58.670 --> 20:04.570
So if there’s a leader, this is ego that
makes you jealous, and this is ego that says

20:04.570 --> 20:09.440
that you know better, you better give a suggestion.

20:09.440 --> 20:13.740
Not that you cannot suggest – people tell
Me also things, but if he doesn’t accept,

20:13.740 --> 20:14.750
well and good.

20:14.750 --> 20:16.860
That’s a challenge to your ego.

20:16.860 --> 20:21.190
It’s better that he says no to you so that
you see for yourself, “Is it my ego still

20:21.190 --> 20:24.310
insisting on that position?”

20:24.310 --> 20:32.850
Now, on the second thing that I have said,
that we should not be drawn by convention.

20:32.850 --> 20:40.370
Like the convention was that, say now, this
time the English felt, the English leaders

20:40.370 --> 20:48.130
felt – which was a big mistake – that
Italians would be inconvenienced if they stay

20:48.130 --> 20:49.130
over.

20:49.130 --> 20:54.380
Italians are very large-hearted people, like
Indians are, they’ll be overjoyed if they

20:54.380 --> 20:55.380
stay over.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.640
But it is the English mind.

20:56.640 --> 21:00.110
It’s the English who cannot tolerate one
person staying for two days.

21:00.110 --> 21:05.800
They’ll ask you immediately as you go, “What
time are you leaving?”

21:05.800 --> 21:10.540
So it is their mind that worked out that way
that it will be inconvenience, because they’ll

21:10.540 --> 21:11.540
be inconvenienced.

21:11.540 --> 21:16.890
Though they were told “you could stay here
till Monday, there’s no problem, you have

21:16.890 --> 21:20.310
to just pay just ten pounds”; but – “I
thought” – like that.

21:20.310 --> 21:27.160
You see, it’s an English image of being
good to others; because to them anybody staying

21:27.160 --> 21:29.360
in their house, finished!

21:29.360 --> 21:32.450
They won’t even allow anybody to come inside
the house.

21:32.450 --> 21:36.430
Let there be snow or anything outside, they’ll
just see and talk to you and then they’ll

21:36.430 --> 21:37.430
say.

21:37.430 --> 21:43.260
I’ve seen it Myself.

21:43.260 --> 21:50.440
One day we had, I had gone out; it was snowing,
and I saw a lady standing out on a doorstep

21:50.440 --> 21:55.700
with a pram, and there was a little baby.

21:55.700 --> 22:03.290
And the other lady was an old lady talking
from inside, just from the chink, in a way

22:03.290 --> 22:07.050
that the door was not completely opened out.

22:07.050 --> 22:11.190
And when I came back after an hour or so,
still that lady was standing outside and talking.

22:11.190 --> 22:14.720
This lady didn’t have sense to say that
“you come in.”

22:14.720 --> 22:28.880
But this another lady did not mind it also,
because she must be doing the same!

22:28.880 --> 22:33.350
So the large-heartedness of anything they
cannot understand.

22:33.350 --> 22:38.580
Moreover there was no problem, it was suggested
that you can stay here and you can be here.

22:38.580 --> 22:43.730
Now today we had to hurry up a lot, the whole
thing was quite inconvenienced and we had

22:43.730 --> 22:48.940
to do it, because of a slight mistake that
they should have asked Me.

22:48.940 --> 22:53.430
And I thought you all were staying on Monday,
because it’s logical, it’s sensible.

22:53.430 --> 22:57.590
But because of the conception that “we should
not inconvenience” ….

22:57.590 --> 23:03.010
It is not only with English, it is possible
with anyone of you.

23:03.010 --> 23:08.520
When you start thinking “I thought,” you
are gone.

23:08.520 --> 23:14.820
So these concepts that you have about things
are actually very dangerous things.

23:14.820 --> 23:22.030
I’ve been having experiences of experiences
of these stupid conventions people have.

23:22.030 --> 23:24.420
“I thought.”

23:24.420 --> 23:30.520
They try to be good, but ultimately try to
be nasty.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.030
They are nasty.

23:32.030 --> 23:36.800
So that means there’s something definitely
wrong with the convention they have about

23:36.800 --> 23:42.740
things.

23:42.740 --> 23:48.090
And that’s why people, if they were right
when they were thinking, world would have

23:48.090 --> 23:49.370
been a different thing.

23:49.370 --> 23:56.480
But they are thinking at a level where it’s
just everything is sloping down, and you are

23:56.480 --> 23:57.480
going downward.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.950
As soon as you start thinking, you go downward.

24:00.950 --> 24:08.160
Such is the defect of your thinking, because
it is bound by the tags of your conventions.

24:08.160 --> 24:14.240
Wherever you think, you see, you are bound
by your conventions, and you go down.

24:14.240 --> 24:20.210
I didn’t touch many points today which I
could have touched, like art, I was saying:

24:20.210 --> 24:25.800
I was amazed, an exuberance like this, a flower
like this makes Me so very happy to see a

24:25.800 --> 24:26.800
garden.

24:26.800 --> 24:31.190
But to a sophisticated mind is Baroque or
something nonsensical.

24:31.190 --> 24:36.100
To them one flower somewhere, because the
rest of the area should be their space for

24:36.100 --> 24:38.830
their ego.

24:38.830 --> 24:50.520
So they cannot see the beauty: “it’s too
much, too much.”

24:50.520 --> 24:54.950
Even Sahaja Yoga: “there’s too much for
us.”

24:54.950 --> 24:56.960
What are you, a little baby or what?

24:56.960 --> 24:59.330
What is too much?

24:59.330 --> 25:04.059
You see, as if like a baby we give a bottle,
so much of milk, so much of milk, so “Sahaja

25:04.059 --> 25:05.870
Yoga is too much for me.”

25:05.870 --> 25:11.050
You are dwarves or what?

25:11.050 --> 25:13.670
And there’s no substance in this kind of
a nonsense.

25:13.670 --> 25:18.200
That’s why “this is sophisticated,”
“this is nice,” criticize everyone.

25:18.200 --> 25:24.100
People are so frightened even to decorate
their houses, because it will be criticized.

25:24.100 --> 25:28.080
“Better keep it plain, white.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.400
Just white.”

25:31.400 --> 25:35.141
Even the nose they don’t like, they want
to cut out the nose, eyes, everything, just

25:35.141 --> 25:36.350
have plain!

25:36.350 --> 25:47.970
And imagine, it’s the play of the ego which
wants an individuality.

25:47.970 --> 25:55.150
How they are in juxtaposition with what they
want to do – see this, clearly.

25:55.150 --> 26:00.210
If you go in a garden they’ll have one,
you see, tree somewhere hanging in the air.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.050
This is supposed to be garden.

26:02.050 --> 26:03.110
You say, “Where is the garden”?

26:03.110 --> 26:04.110
“This – garden.”

26:04.110 --> 26:06.450
Microscope: “Where is the garden?”

26:06.450 --> 26:16.550
“Oh no, we put only one thing at a point,
you see, so it becomes important.”

26:16.550 --> 26:21.860
So this is only a tree here and then you move
up, there will be another little bush, then

26:21.860 --> 26:27.350
another tree.

26:27.350 --> 26:28.790
Everything is too much, why?

26:28.790 --> 26:32.160
Because the ego is too much in the head.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.470
That’s why everything is too much for them.

26:35.470 --> 26:39.220
This stupidity has to go now.

26:39.220 --> 26:44.340
You have to take whatever is good, too much
you must take, and give up whatever is too

26:44.340 --> 26:46.550
much in you.

26:46.550 --> 26:48.980
That has to be understood.

26:48.980 --> 26:56.101
All these stupid ideas, all kinds of stupid
ideas – like you want to buy a house, so

26:56.101 --> 26:58.490
it’s all right, you go and buy a house.

26:58.490 --> 27:07.940
I went round, and most of the houses are about
seven-and-a-half feet height, but they like

27:07.940 --> 27:08.940
it.

27:08.940 --> 27:09.940
I said, “Why?”

27:09.940 --> 27:10.940
“It’s very old.”

27:10.940 --> 27:11.940
I said, “So what?”

27:11.940 --> 27:16.000
“But it’s an old house, it is this and
that, and the old houses ...”

27:16.000 --> 27:17.650
“But why do you like?”

27:17.650 --> 27:21.990
New houses are eight feet, at the most.

27:21.990 --> 27:23.360
So there’s no choice.

27:23.360 --> 27:27.520
But why do you want to have a house which
is old house?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.980
Victorian houses they don’t like.

27:29.980 --> 27:30.980
Why?

27:30.980 --> 27:35.540
Because they are not so conventional, they
are not so fashionable.

27:35.540 --> 27:39.670
You must have a house where you should break
your neck.

27:39.670 --> 27:46.020
Walk into the bathroom in an awkward way,
you can’t even sit or stand; halfway you

27:46.020 --> 27:47.540
hang in the air.

27:47.540 --> 27:51.660
That’s the very house of a character.

27:51.660 --> 27:57.720
And a character is that which makes you awkward
and feel funny: that person “has character.”

27:57.720 --> 28:04.140
I mean, a person if he’s absurd, he’s
queer, weird, he’s strange, he’s a man

28:04.140 --> 28:06.010
of character.

28:06.010 --> 28:07.950
This is the situation today.

28:07.950 --> 28:13.300
He’s a man of character and he’s weird,
absolutely a strange personality.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.000
How is it?

28:15.000 --> 28:18.340
“You know, he came on a bicycle with a half-pant.”

28:18.340 --> 28:19.340
I said, “Really?”

28:19.340 --> 28:21.040
“He’s a man of character.”

28:21.040 --> 28:25.340
Here he is getting arthritis with it.

28:25.340 --> 28:31.800
Being queer, funny stupid things is regarded
as something of personality.

28:31.800 --> 28:37.600
Now as Sahaja yogis you have to realize that
you are not that stupid.

28:37.600 --> 28:44.990
You are crowned with your Self.

28:44.990 --> 28:49.640
Now you are not going to behave like these
stupid people and their fashions, so give

28:49.640 --> 28:50.860
it up.

28:50.860 --> 28:54.900
They laugh at you, you laugh at them!

28:54.900 --> 29:03.703
In a lunatic asylum if you go, all the lunatics
will say, “Oh, so you have also come here

29:03.703 --> 29:04.703
to join us, isn’t it?”

29:04.703 --> 29:09.320
They all think they are the wisest, and you
get lost with them.

29:09.320 --> 29:13.990
You start thinking, “Am I a lunatic myself?”

29:13.990 --> 29:18.080
So you all, when you see such a person you
should just laugh at him.

29:18.080 --> 29:26.200
Like a lady, you see, she thought her to be
very fashionable, she came with her dress,

29:26.200 --> 29:33.110
you see, very open, her body with all her
bones showing, and this and that.

29:33.110 --> 29:37.420
And we happened to go to see that house, Myself
and My husband.

29:37.420 --> 29:41.550
So as soon as he saw her, he came back and
vomited.

29:41.550 --> 29:42.550
I said, “What’s the matter?’”

29:42.550 --> 29:44.000
“I saw her – I vomited.”

29:44.000 --> 29:50.940
And we got into the car, we didn’t enter
even, came away.

29:50.940 --> 29:56.690
And she thought she was a very fashionable
lady, showing her bones, all her body – horrible.

29:56.690 --> 30:00.451
Imagine, like a dead body standing before
you!

30:00.451 --> 30:08.760
But the dead body is regarded as fashionable,
so everybody wants to behave like a dead body.

30:08.760 --> 30:17.534
Now you should see the sense in it, otherwise
you are not Sahaja yogis.

30:17.534 --> 30:25.600
You must see the nonsense that is going on,
and you are not a nonsensical personality.

30:25.600 --> 30:32.520
So all these things now, if you see from a
new angle – as I’ve told you now that

30:32.520 --> 30:38.240
you are higher personalities, that you have
achieved a new awareness of your chakras – you’ll

30:38.240 --> 30:41.850
be amazed, your reactions will be very, very
different.

30:41.850 --> 30:46.170
If you see something like this: “Ah!”
you’ll say, “beautiful!”

30:46.170 --> 30:52.290
But till you have those horrible conventions
with you, you cannot.

30:52.290 --> 30:57.980
A house which is dilapidated, absolutely going
to fall on your head, is “what a character!”

30:57.980 --> 31:02.570
The whole character will fall on your head!

31:02.570 --> 31:08.410
Absurd ideas people have.

31:08.410 --> 31:12.450
And then they want something modern which
is absolutely weird and nonsensical.

31:12.450 --> 31:20.320
You see, there was a lady, she built a house
– modern, and we had to climb up her steps,

31:20.320 --> 31:23.460
and every steps she has divided into smaller,
smaller pieces.

31:23.460 --> 31:26.330
We were so much worried that we’ll all fall
off.

31:26.330 --> 31:31.170
You see, every step was made of small, small
pieces like a step, you see, every step was

31:31.170 --> 31:32.809
made into steps.

31:32.809 --> 31:38.260
So when you put your foot there you don’t
know where you are putting your foot, you

31:38.260 --> 31:39.260
see.

31:39.260 --> 31:43.680
And she must have spent a lot of money making
that kind of a nonsensical thing; but to her,

31:43.680 --> 31:46.500
she would show everyone, “Now, come along,
see this.”

31:46.500 --> 31:47.550
I refused to go up.

31:47.550 --> 31:50.790
I said, “I have nothing to do.”

31:50.790 --> 31:52.370
I went back.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.470
Yes, yes, doesn’t matter.

31:54.470 --> 31:55.470
As they show resentment, you must show resentment.

31:55.470 --> 31:56.470
Stupid!

31:56.470 --> 32:07.930
It doesn’t appeal to Me, it doesn’t appeal
to Me these things.

32:07.930 --> 32:12.770
I have seen and I don’t like it these things,
the way there’s one flower hanging somewhere,

32:12.770 --> 32:14.790
and anything if I see, I don’t like it.

32:14.790 --> 32:17.679
I don’t enjoy it at all Myself.

32:17.679 --> 32:22.110
And if I am the criteria, if I am the one
who can judge things, then I would tell you

32:22.110 --> 32:23.590
I don’t like all this nonsense.

32:23.590 --> 32:28.490
The way people dress up these days they look
like clowns to Me, lunatics, like I can say

32:28.490 --> 32:32.240
brats, or you can call them – what do you
call them?

32:32.240 --> 32:33.240
– tramps.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.230
You cannot make out one from the another.

32:35.230 --> 32:40.340
Their lousy pants, you see, some grandfather’s
pant they are wearing, and their grandmother’s

32:40.340 --> 32:44.170
blouse on top, and the ladies walking on the
street.

32:44.170 --> 32:51.690
See, is you feel there’s some funny, queer
people walking across – and they think it’s

32:51.690 --> 32:52.690
fashionable!

32:52.690 --> 33:01.630
I think from India we should get all old clothes
here and sell them off for a high price!

33:01.630 --> 33:06.850
It’s very queer.

33:06.850 --> 33:10.190
You just look at it, see from this angle.

33:10.190 --> 33:15.240
Standing on the hilltop you look at these
mad people, see how lunatic they are, stupid

33:15.240 --> 33:18.690
they are, how they are behaving, what is their
fashion.

33:18.690 --> 33:28.410
I mean, if you see in the olden times people
used to dress up well with all kinds of frills,

33:28.410 --> 33:35.300
all kinds of things, but this is what they
don’t like.

33:35.300 --> 33:39.190
Whatever is God has given us should be decorated
and respected.

33:39.190 --> 33:46.470
I mean, yesterday the way you did the hall,
I mean today the way you did the whole of

33:46.470 --> 33:52.600
the hall and all that, so beautiful it looked,
so nice it looked.

33:52.600 --> 33:59.210
But somebody would say, “Oh, let us have
absolutely plain thing for Mother: some dilapidated

33:59.210 --> 34:02.000
wall behind, which is about to fall down.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.470
That would be real character.”

34:05.470 --> 34:10.270
How can these ideas be acceptable to Sahaja
yogis?

34:10.270 --> 34:15.399
This I just don’t understand.

34:15.399 --> 34:20.530
And they pay for it.

34:20.530 --> 34:25.700
They pay for these conventions and they pay
for all these kinds of odd things, they do

34:25.700 --> 34:27.000
pay for it.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.919
Supposing there’s a fashion today to have
your hair cut like this on top, they’ll

34:31.919 --> 34:33.050
pay for it.

34:33.050 --> 34:38.230
Then you cut them another way, they pay for
it.

34:38.230 --> 34:41.649
You have to pay for all these misdoings also.

34:41.649 --> 34:47.450
The fashion is: supposing somebody invites
somebody to your house, you must have a different

34:47.450 --> 34:55.530
type of a glass cup and a glass for this,
otherwise you are not all right.

34:55.530 --> 34:58.980
And then what you find, there’s another
group of these hippies and all those have

34:58.980 --> 35:05.600
come, they will give you the dirtiest possible
mugs that you cannot drink anything.

35:05.600 --> 35:11.100
So either you accept this nonsense or that
nonsense.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.590
It’s absolutely absurd!

35:13.590 --> 35:19.860
And you know, I have seen Indians when they
are in England, they just don’t understand,

35:19.860 --> 35:26.550
they just “Cancel them, all right, cancel
them.

35:26.550 --> 35:29.670
They’re mad people.”

35:29.670 --> 35:40.990
The quality of personality is very, very low,
very low, take it from Me – very low.

35:40.990 --> 35:51.400
You might have ego, might exist with that
ego, but it’s very low here, accept it.

35:51.400 --> 35:56.790
Innocence is missing, auspiciousness is missing,
cleanliness is missing.

35:56.790 --> 36:06.630
The, the attraction of simplicity is missing
– so artificial.

36:06.630 --> 36:10.190
Even the idea of simplicity is artificial.

36:10.190 --> 36:17.540
With artificiality how can you have a quality
of human life?

36:17.540 --> 36:19.580
How can you?

36:19.580 --> 36:23.590
You become artificial people.

36:23.590 --> 36:28.020
So give up all these conventions.

36:28.020 --> 36:33.980
I am not here to propagate Indian culture
as such, but I must say if there is any culture

36:33.980 --> 36:37.930
it is in India, because this is no culture.

36:37.930 --> 36:44.680
All becoming – if you walk about, I mean
you look like, when I see the people around,

36:44.680 --> 36:49.760
they look like host of mad people walking.

36:49.760 --> 36:53.000
You see them on the streets, not one person
is normal.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.670
America is even worse.

36:54.670 --> 37:02.940
They must be doing like this, or this like
this; not one person has a proper face.

37:02.940 --> 37:08.710
Is a fact, I tell you!

37:08.710 --> 37:13.440
With Sahaja Yoga your quality has come up,
it has come up.

37:13.440 --> 37:22.310
You’ve become that now, so great.

37:22.310 --> 37:28.390
That’s why you do not feel here there is
lakshmi.

37:28.390 --> 37:32.120
You have money, but no lakshmi.

37:32.120 --> 37:36.370
There’s no beauty of that.

37:36.370 --> 37:45.370
It’s so desolate, like a barren land.

37:45.370 --> 37:52.320
Your ego has blown off everything that was
beautiful.

37:52.320 --> 37:56.480
You could not tolerate anybody’s art, so
you would not have anything artistic things

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
in the house.

37:57.480 --> 38:07.630
You need not have many things at all, so you
have plastics.

38:07.630 --> 38:10.150
Beauty has run away from your lives.

38:10.150 --> 38:15.810
When you talk also it’s fashionable to be
arrogant.

38:15.810 --> 38:26.780
Imagine – to be arrogant, to be very dry:
there’s no beauty in it.

38:26.780 --> 38:41.830
Is all put-up show; there’s no bravery in
it, nothing sublime.

38:41.830 --> 38:47.580
On the subtle form you have lost it, that’s
why in the gross form you don’t see it.

38:47.580 --> 38:57.780
Whatever you have lost inside is shown outside
– bankruptcy, complete bankruptcy.

38:57.780 --> 39:02.080
So when you see that with others – when
I am saying “you” I am meaning the others,

39:02.080 --> 39:07.500
those who are not yet Sahaja yogis in the
West – try to understand they are at a much

39:07.500 --> 39:13.260
lower level than you are, and don’t take
to their ideas and their ways and methods.

39:13.260 --> 39:16.760
Just keep yourself aloof.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.760
And then you will see they’ll run after
you.

39:18.760 --> 39:25.820
Ego is like a donkey: if somebody is ahead
of them, they know somebody is ahead of them,

39:25.820 --> 39:28.310
then they bend their head to that.

39:28.310 --> 39:37.290
And if they see somebody is behind them, then
they kick.

39:37.290 --> 39:41.540
So you have your dignity, you have your special
style, you live with a special style.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.930
Don’t be one of them.

39:43.930 --> 39:46.990
Dress up properly in a proper way.

39:46.990 --> 39:54.619
You may have only two shirts, you may have
only three shirts, you need not have many;

39:54.619 --> 40:11.470
but have in something sensible, normal, comfortable,
and also which is not jarring to others.

40:11.470 --> 40:16.990
We are the ones who are going to encourage
our art, we are the ones who are going to

40:16.990 --> 40:19.290
bring back all that is lost.

40:19.290 --> 40:25.490
We can’t have Rembrandt anymore, we cannot
have Leonardo da Vinci, we cannot have Michelangelo

40:25.490 --> 40:27.750
again – finished them all completely.

40:27.750 --> 40:31.490
But everybody thinks they are Michelangelo!

40:31.490 --> 40:51.410
We can’t even have, say, Gorky; we can’t
have William Blake, can we – of that courage?

40:51.410 --> 40:58.200
We cannot have Abraham Lincoln, can we have?

40:58.200 --> 41:05.160
All dwarfs, useless people.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.740
You scratch them and you find they are good
for nothing, useless.

41:07.740 --> 41:14.810
Out of you all these great people have to
come out now.

41:14.810 --> 41:17.820
And their speciality about them, they had
their own personality, and they would not

41:17.820 --> 41:20.280
give way to any fashions or anything.

41:20.280 --> 41:24.440
They wouldn’t give way to any cheap popularity.

41:24.440 --> 41:35.130
Out of you people all these great personalities
are to be born.

41:35.130 --> 41:42.030
So for you and for your progeny you have to
think, what are we doing in such a great work

41:42.030 --> 41:43.030
as it is.

41:43.030 --> 41:46.911
It’s not only for your enjoyment that we
have a seminar, nice music, nice food, nice

41:46.911 --> 41:51.910
place, we come, we enjoy – no.

41:51.910 --> 42:04.230
Enjoyment is just an advertising department.

42:04.230 --> 42:13.220
You have to really work hard inside, not outside.

42:13.220 --> 42:20.250
No arguments of any kind.

42:20.250 --> 42:23.640
Useless!

42:23.640 --> 42:29.609
Simple thing, if I say I have to carry, say,
this box, somebody will come out and start

42:29.609 --> 42:32.310
saying, “All right, then I think we should
get a van.”

42:32.310 --> 42:33.990
“No, but a van is too much.”

42:33.990 --> 42:35.460
“Then what should we do?”

42:35.460 --> 42:39.690
They’ll go on arguing till that the box
is gone, everything is done, and I come back

42:39.690 --> 42:40.849
and say, “Now, what are you doing?”

42:40.849 --> 42:45.460
They are still discussing how to take the
box – it’s already gone!

42:45.460 --> 42:58.849
Such wasteful habits we should give up.

42:58.849 --> 43:02.090
We have to have new wisdom within us.

43:02.090 --> 43:05.500
All this old wisdom, you just throw it away.

43:05.500 --> 43:09.780
Unless and until you do that, your ego won’t
go away.

43:09.780 --> 43:17.590
It won’t leave you, unless and until you
decide to throw away all those ideas which

43:17.590 --> 43:22.770
to you appear to be the ego.

43:22.770 --> 43:30.950
You have to be like children, trying to learn
something new all the time; we are to be open

43:30.950 --> 43:32.550
to learn something new all the time.

43:32.550 --> 43:35.400
You have to learn – you have lost it.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.920
You had something that you have lost, so many.

43:37.920 --> 43:41.849
Instead of going ahead, you have lost it.

43:41.849 --> 43:48.200
You were doing all right; if you had remained
on the right path you would have achieved,

43:48.200 --> 43:52.280
because after all, some countries are traditionally
very old.

43:52.280 --> 43:55.280
They also got lost – like Greece, you can
say is lost.

43:55.280 --> 44:02.790
Horrible Greek tragedies: I mean, you sit
down and cry for nothing at all.

44:02.790 --> 44:06.880
Nothing has happened, everything is perfect;
people just go and sit down and cry.

44:06.880 --> 44:11.430
It’s like you make somebody say that “This
one is dead.

44:11.430 --> 44:14.020
Let us now feel that he’s dead.

44:14.020 --> 44:18.119
Sit down, all of us should cry.”

44:18.119 --> 44:19.290
Stupid as that!

44:19.290 --> 44:24.480
It’s all artificially-created problems and
artificially-created gloom, because you have

44:24.480 --> 44:26.690
no real gloom, you have no real problem.

44:26.690 --> 44:33.000
You have got food to eat, you’ve got everything
– that’s why you are creating problems

44:33.000 --> 44:34.369
for yourself.

44:34.369 --> 44:39.859
That’s why you need psychiatrists, you need
drugs, you need this, you need that; because

44:39.859 --> 44:45.130
you have no problems, so you want to have
some problems – as simple as that.

44:45.130 --> 44:47.040
Those who have problem have to fight with
it.

44:47.040 --> 44:52.190
They have no time for all these nonsensical
things.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.190
You have too much time.

44:53.190 --> 44:58.150
All your problems are solved as far as the
material things are concerned, but still you

44:58.150 --> 45:00.350
are very much involved into it.

45:00.350 --> 45:10.920
So now face it, face it clearly, that we are
not that any more.

45:10.920 --> 45:12.410
We are different people.

45:12.410 --> 45:20.680
We are no more worms in the mud but we are
lotuses, we have fragrance, we have powers,

45:20.680 --> 45:25.470
we are specially blessed.

45:25.470 --> 45:28.310
We have a special sense of joy.

45:28.310 --> 45:40.930
Let’s enjoy that and give it to others and
be glorified with it, feel the dignity of

45:40.930 --> 45:43.230
it.

45:43.230 --> 45:47.520
I’m sure it is going to work out this time.

45:47.520 --> 45:55.950
I have done My level best, I think, and this
lecture should really go through you all.

45:55.950 --> 45:59.860
All right, any questions?

45:59.860 --> 46:04.180
(Please have some water.)

46:04.180 --> 46:08.109
Any questions you have?

46:08.109 --> 46:11.349
(Water.)

46:11.349 --> 46:19.750
They might be thinking that I’ll drink from
here!

46:19.750 --> 46:21.690
Modern idea maybe that I drink from here!

46:21.690 --> 46:30.869
So there’s no need to have glass, Mother
may like to drink from there!

46:30.869 --> 46:48.849
All right, any questions?

46:48.849 --> 47:02.340
In thoughtless awareness.

47:02.340 --> 47:08.150
Now keep it up, keep it up in thoughtless
awareness – absolutely you’re blasted.

47:08.150 --> 47:10.099
Keep it up.

47:10.099 --> 47:12.060
Keep yourself blasted.

47:12.060 --> 47:13.260
That is this ego business.

47:13.260 --> 47:19.070
Little bit is still there, rudimentary: keep
it out.

47:19.070 --> 47:30.200
This is meditation, where there’s no ego
any more, you are in thoughtless awareness,

47:30.200 --> 47:32.190
absolutely stunned.

47:32.190 --> 47:34.190
Can’t think.

47:34.190 --> 47:38.750
But that I have done, is not good – you
should do it.

47:38.750 --> 47:43.670
That is the point I am commenting on.

47:43.670 --> 47:45.050
Have your own personality.

47:45.050 --> 48:07.780
If punks could behave like that, why can’t
you behave sensibly?

48:07.780 --> 48:19.841
And also I have to say few words about how
we behave in our day-to-day life; because

48:19.841 --> 48:25.170
a Mother has to see that they are, children
are not to be ill-bred.

48:25.170 --> 48:29.410
People should not say that Sahaja yogis are
ill-bred, you see.

48:29.410 --> 48:36.400
Now the first sign of an ill-bred child is
that he leaves his bed in a mess.

48:36.400 --> 48:42.220
He leaves all his things in a mess.

48:42.220 --> 48:45.270
While coming I saw all the beds.

48:45.270 --> 48:50.880
What are we doing here?

48:50.880 --> 48:52.010
Nothing.

48:52.010 --> 48:58.890
So put yourself into a discipline of leading
a neat life.

48:58.890 --> 49:02.349
As a Mother I have to tell you this.

49:02.349 --> 49:08.720
It takes hardly ten to fifteen minutes, but
just tell yourself this is meditation, do

49:08.720 --> 49:10.880
in meditative way.

49:10.880 --> 49:17.280
We in India think that the Western people
are extremely neat and tidy.

49:17.280 --> 49:20.090
Really!

49:20.090 --> 49:21.090
They can’t believe it.

49:21.090 --> 49:24.800
They think you are on top of the world, you
must be the neatest people ever lived.

49:24.800 --> 49:34.610
They’ll say ten times “thank you”, but
even once you will not keep your bed all right.

49:34.610 --> 49:38.210
Your things should be neat.

49:38.210 --> 49:46.670
You must keep yourself neat, appear neatly.

49:46.670 --> 49:51.270
Then second thing I have seen, noticed this,
which is told by many people which I have

49:51.270 --> 49:54.390
also noticed, that you go to somebody’s
house.

49:54.390 --> 50:00.980
Then an ill-bred person will start using the
phone without asking.

50:00.980 --> 50:07.440
Certain things are important to understand,
like entering into the kitchen, eating everything.

50:07.440 --> 50:18.200
It’s a very common thing people are noticing
this, that you get the food – like paupers,

50:18.200 --> 50:24.220
like beggars they come in the house.

50:24.220 --> 50:30.340
I had at least twenty-one bottles of honey
which people had given Me as present, and

50:30.340 --> 50:35.820
when My son-in-law came there was not even
one bottle to give him honey.

50:35.820 --> 50:36.820
So who ate?

50:36.820 --> 50:41.210
All the Sahaja yogis who came ate the honey.

50:41.210 --> 50:47.089
I mean, it’s all right, but you must ask.

50:47.089 --> 50:49.530
You polish off everything in the house.

50:49.530 --> 50:53.710
All right, you have come, if there is a food
cooked for you, just have your food.

50:53.710 --> 51:03.960
If you
go in the larder or you go anywhere, you find

51:03.960 --> 51:06.610
everything is missing.

51:06.610 --> 51:13.200
You buy from the whole mart, you find everything’s
polished off.

51:13.200 --> 51:18.359
So an ill-bred person can be made out like
that.

51:18.359 --> 51:24.790
But you’ll be surprised, a good-breeding
person, even if this much is left of another

51:24.790 --> 51:30.810
person, that person will keep it and keep
it till it is passed over.

51:30.810 --> 51:35.890
I’ll tell you about My own husband who is
– he need not worry about this thing, but

51:35.890 --> 51:41.410
if he knows we have something of another person,
he’ll put it in lock and key and see every

51:41.410 --> 51:49.150
time it is there, till he returns it to him.

51:49.150 --> 51:57.980
And same I can say about My children, or anybody
I know of.

51:57.980 --> 52:03.510
But this is beggarish that you take somebody’s
things, misuse it, throw away where you feel

52:03.510 --> 52:05.330
like, break everything.

52:05.330 --> 52:12.890
But I have seen with My own things; so when
the leaders have been complaining to Me that

52:12.890 --> 52:17.560
“they come to our houses, they polish off
everything from our fridges” and all that,

52:17.560 --> 52:21.340
I was not surprised.

52:21.340 --> 52:28.839
The Sahaja Yoga has become like a resort for
all the beggars and the paupers of the world,

52:28.839 --> 52:29.839
because it is free.

52:29.839 --> 52:37.349
All the poor people come down to Sahaja Yoga,
and you have to nourish them and look after

52:37.349 --> 52:38.349
them.

52:38.349 --> 52:40.119
It should not be such.

52:40.119 --> 52:47.920
You may be poor, but you must have dignity.

52:47.920 --> 52:52.580
Even the servants are in India better.

52:52.580 --> 52:56.100
They wouldn’t touch your things without
asking.

52:56.100 --> 53:02.660
They have much more breeding.

53:02.660 --> 53:12.400
An ill-bred person is a person who is a rude
person, arrogant person.

53:12.400 --> 53:16.010
You can say the same thing in a proper manner.

53:16.010 --> 53:24.890
As a Mother, to give Me real glory is that,
that people should say that you are very well-brought-up

53:24.890 --> 53:27.800
children.

53:27.800 --> 53:43.540
A kind of system must exist.

53:43.540 --> 53:45.020
A spartan system.

53:45.020 --> 53:47.070
It’s a spartan system.

53:47.070 --> 53:53.130
It’s not all a sort of a lousy system, it’s
a spartan system.

53:53.130 --> 53:56.010
You are yogis.

53:56.010 --> 54:03.750
Should be neat, tidy, all the time clean,
with few things.

54:03.750 --> 54:10.240
Like in India, people are quite shocked: you
carry such big, big bags, and it carries all

54:10.240 --> 54:13.761
the – for ladies specially – all the paints
and this and that.

54:13.761 --> 54:20.020
Where are you going to use before the villagers
there, these paints?

54:20.020 --> 54:23.690
They don’t understand.

54:23.690 --> 54:26.130
All these things we have to see for ourselves.

54:26.130 --> 54:39.020
We have to be dignified, we have to be people
with a kind of a personality.

54:39.020 --> 54:40.280
Supposing somebody is a saint.

54:40.280 --> 54:48.220
He might be a poor man, but you can make him
out by his dignity.

54:48.220 --> 54:53.970
There was a saint called Tukarama whom, which
you have heard about him – this all may

54:53.970 --> 54:59.290
be, I don’t know, was coming from his music.

54:59.290 --> 55:02.760
He was poor and very generous also.

55:02.760 --> 55:08.210
He used to give away everything, and always
left with very little.

55:08.210 --> 55:17.800
So Shivaji Maharaj, the great Shivaji came
down to his place, brought lots of ornaments

55:17.800 --> 55:22.230
and things and presentations, and gave it
to his wife and children.

55:22.230 --> 55:23.770
He was out.

55:23.770 --> 55:26.720
She was very happy to wear all these things
because he gave.

55:26.720 --> 55:30.200
He said, “This is ...” Of course, in the
beginning she also said that it’s not all

55:30.200 --> 55:31.200
right.

55:31.200 --> 55:36.420
But he said, “No, I am just trying to sort
of pay my respects to you, this, that, and

55:36.420 --> 55:37.420
give.”

55:37.420 --> 55:38.420
And she wore it.

55:38.420 --> 55:39.420
He came.

55:39.420 --> 55:45.450
He said, “No, I am a saint.

55:45.450 --> 55:46.450
You take this.

55:46.450 --> 55:49.620
You are a king, and you have to live like
a king.

55:49.620 --> 55:56.310
All right, as a king you can have it.

55:56.310 --> 56:01.109
But not – as a saint I don’t need all
these things, my wife doesn’t need all these

56:01.109 --> 56:02.109
things.

56:02.109 --> 56:07.810
Because you are living like a king, you – maybe
you are a realized soul also, but you are

56:07.810 --> 56:14.290
a king, so live like a king.”

56:14.290 --> 56:21.990
But one has to realize that in Sahaja Yoga
you are not to move like a barren personality

56:21.990 --> 56:22.990
also.

56:22.990 --> 56:27.530
You have to be properly dressed, properly
appearing.

56:27.530 --> 56:36.300
You should not look like beggars, but you
should look like dignified people of the society.

56:36.300 --> 56:42.440
Now for example, as you know I am the Goddess,
and the Goddess has to wear I don’t know

56:42.440 --> 56:46.380
how many ornaments just to adorn Her chakras.

56:46.380 --> 56:51.530
I mean, I have lots of ornaments Myself of
My own.

56:51.530 --> 56:59.940
But only for puja I wear, otherwise I don’t
wear: I am supposed to wear lots of things.

56:59.940 --> 57:00.940
Why?

57:00.940 --> 57:07.440
Because it may not be that – all right,
may be dignified, but may not be that all

57:07.440 --> 57:12.140
right to wear all those things all the time.

57:12.140 --> 57:13.440
But I am supposed to wear.

57:13.440 --> 57:20.700
Like You are supposed to wear many more things
in the hand here, rings on the feet, everything.

57:20.700 --> 57:28.730
All the time You have wear gold in the – what
do you call the – you don’t have that

57:28.730 --> 57:33.460
ornament here which we tie up like a belt.

57:33.460 --> 57:38.720
But I don’t do it.

57:38.720 --> 57:46.190
I keep it to a marginal point; only in puja
I wear some things out of it.

57:46.190 --> 57:55.480
So you must have that discretion: what to
wear, how to wear, how far to go, how to look

57:55.480 --> 58:06.900
dignified, how to be well-bred, so that you
glorify the breeding of your Mother.

58:06.900 --> 58:16.340
This time I hope when you all come to India,
you will notice all these things among Indians.

58:16.340 --> 58:22.940
You will never see them eating, you’ll never
see them having their baths, you will never

58:22.940 --> 58:26.300
see them sleeping.

58:26.300 --> 58:30.640
You don’t know how they live, where they
live, how they work out, everything.

58:30.640 --> 58:35.010
They are just there on the spot whenever you
are there.

58:35.010 --> 58:36.170
Isn’t it true?

58:36.170 --> 58:41.590
They take their baths, they finish everything,
early in the morning, about four o’clock

58:41.590 --> 58:47.120
or five o’clock they are out – spartan.

58:47.120 --> 58:54.450
And always clean: whether he’s a villager,
whether he is a scheduled caste or a brahmin

58:54.450 --> 58:59.940
or anything, they’re all neatly dressed,
you cannot make them out.

58:59.940 --> 59:08.050
Clean white clothes they’ll wear, clean
white cap they will have.

59:08.050 --> 59:18.589
They’ll never have dirty clothes.

59:18.589 --> 59:27.579
So this is another side, which is not so sublime
on your side and not so subtle and, but it’s

59:27.579 --> 59:40.310
very important; because whatever is in the
subtle expresses outside.

59:40.310 --> 59:51.490
In all your behavior this would shine, like
thousand facets of a diamond, because you

59:51.490 --> 01:00:00.830
have attended now the Sahasrara Day – let’s
see; what are the thousand facets will show.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:13.640
Love each other, respect each other, respect
yourself, and all the time say one mantra

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.260
within yourself, “I am a Sahaja yogi.”

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.859
It says everything about your responsibilities,
what are your aspirations, what you are.

01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:34.290
You
are a Sahaja yogi, being reborn by Adi Shakti

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:46.110
Herself.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:50.700
Any personal problems you have you should
write to Me, and I’ll try to answer.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:55.359
If I do not answer, then think that answer
I have managed.

01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:59.150
If I do not answer, then think that I have
managed the answer; but if there’s anything

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.380
to be suggested I will definitely inform you.

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.590
Any other problem.

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:10.329
But like a lady today came, she was crying
about her husband.

01:01:10.329 --> 01:01:14.820
This she did before also, again today she
is crying – she’ll go mad.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.800
A Sahaja yogi should not cry.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.999
Overcome your problem, try to handle your
husband, try to handle everything.

01:01:23.999 --> 01:01:28.880
I do not very much like the divorce part of
it, but if somebody’s a gone case is all

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880
right.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.480
If I say it’s a gone case, you divorce.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:39.670
But unnecessarily, just because there’s
not yet proper understanding, one should not

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:41.470
cry, weep and do all these things.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:52.820
On the contrary, one should try to overcome
your own personal problems, because you have

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:58.810
powers.

01:01:58.810 --> 01:01:59.980
And You can write to Me.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.590
Not very long letters, but I get lost!

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:16.339
Ha, really, I get lost!

01:02:16.339 --> 01:02:23.630
In the morning there are so many letters for
Me to read, one better than the other, and

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:29.320
My husband also get a big post.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:36.099
But he says, “Nobody writes me love letters,
they all write about their bills to be paid.”

01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:53.839
I said, “It’s just the same!”

01:02:53.839 --> 01:03:04.349
(You may translate this, Gregoire, if they
want.)

01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:39.430
Letters … full of
problems …

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:44.300
I said, “I have to pay for their love.”

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.839
That’s what it is.

01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:55.650
But children write very sweet letters.

01:03:55.650 --> 01:04:01.550
They just make some painting or something,
or some flowers and few things there, that’s

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:02.550
all.

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:08.200
They’ll make the heart and put Me there,
or something like that; very sweet, sweet

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.740
things they do.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:16.890
And just the joy and happiness, you see, they
express it.

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:20.060
Never their problems – they have no problems,
children don’t have, they are not complicated.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.930
We catch hold of the problems, that’s the
trouble is.

01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:30.310
They have no problems of any kind.

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:35.380
So you have not told Me, any one of you, anything
that you want Me to be done.

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:40.880
Now only thing, at the last I would like you
to listen to Warren who will read it out to

01:04:40.880 --> 01:05:05.079
you, the programs we are going to have in
this summer-time.

01:05:05.079 --> 01:05:06.750
Come forward.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:09.930
…. Yes, now.

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:20.440
…. No, no, no, then I go to Houston.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.520
…. Yes.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.250
And then visiting London, that’s all.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.250
…. Yes.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:27.210
…. Twenty-seventh I think, I go.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:28.210
Yes, twenty-seventh.

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.210
….

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:31.140
That’s not definite, but we’ll see.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.619
In the evening.

01:05:32.619 --> 01:05:33.619
…. Puja.

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:36.589
That’s the puja for Belgium and Holland.

01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:42.210
…. No, better to have puja at a place where
we have the Monday program.

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:43.410
In Belgium.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.810
No, just after that.

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:48.810
About fourteenth I come back?

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.339
So that is what, a Saturday or a Sunday?

01:05:51.339 --> 01:05:52.339
…. Spanish people are here still?

01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:53.339
Or they are gone?

01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:55.600
…. So, they would like Me to be there for
a weekend, or for the weekdays?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.540
That’s the point to be decided.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:03.869
…. One day …. So, what is – Spanish
people, are they more available on weekends

01:06:03.869 --> 01:06:04.869
or weekdays?

01:06:04.869 --> 01:06:05.869
Weekdays, weekdays.

01:06:05.869 --> 01:06:08.930
So I can fly on, say, Tuesday.

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:20.650
On Monday I can fly, and Tuesday we can have
a program: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday – three

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:23.230
days, all right?

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.230
Yes.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:37.950
And then I can – we have to have a puja,
so on Friday.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:47.140
Or I go on Monday would be better: Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.690
And Friday I can go to ….

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:58.100
I can come Sunday evening, and Monday morning
you’ll have the puja, it’s better.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:06.290
And we have programs after the puja; it’s
much better to have programs afterwards.

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:10.300
Then My vibrations are also released.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.309
So Monday morning we’ll have puja.

01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:26.290
…. Have you given them the saris and things
like that?

01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:27.390
No, no.

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:29.040
No, no, no.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.349
Sunday I’m coming back.

01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:32.349
No.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:35.250
Then next Sunday is what?

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:39.849
What is the following Sunday?

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:41.290
Ah, twenty-first.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.290
Monday.

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:44.160
Puja, morning Monday.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:51.270
Or you can have it Sunday night if you like,
puja, which will suit better – Sunday night.

01:07:51.270 --> 01:08:00.150
For puja, Sunday night would be better.

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:01.690
So Sunday morning I’ll go.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.230
Twenty-first Sunday morning I come, all right?

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:05.230
All right.

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:08.000
Then Sunday we have puja, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday I could be there.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:17.779
Thursday I’ll go to Montpellier, and I can
return from there to London.

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:18.950
How many days?

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:20.520
Three days are sufficient?

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520
Three.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520
…. Keep it four now.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.830
So I’ll reach there on Sunday; Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday – it’s all right, four days.

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.000
Thursday morning I’ll go to Montpellier.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:44.569
Thursday evening we’ll have program there,
and then … Is there a direct flight?

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:52.960
…. But is there a flight from there to London?

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.350
It’s a rather out-of-the-way thing.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.350
Is there?

01:08:56.350 --> 01:09:00.659
So why not do Montpellier first, and then
go to Spain?

01:09:00.659 --> 01:09:07.080
But from Montpellier to Spain, is there a
flight or not?

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.579
That you find out first of all.

01:09:11.579 --> 01:09:22.559
But you keep it that time, about that time;
definite we’ll let you know, once we have

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:34.410
done with the Montpellier.

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.390
…. No flight?

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:43.719
…. But in any case you keep this program
with them.

01:09:43.719 --> 01:09:48.020
Otherwise I’ll do it earlier or later, whatever
it is.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.029
First of all keep this program, definite.

01:09:51.029 --> 01:10:15.630
See, Montpellier even if I don’t do, France
is there, it’s all right.

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:20.059
I can do it later on, doesn’t matter.

01:10:20.059 --> 01:10:27.880
But this I have to do, Spain, properly.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.880
All right?

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:35.559
Rather awkward, I think, to go from there,
isn’t it?

01:10:35.559 --> 01:10:37.510
There’s no flight.

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:40.760
It’s too much for Me.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:51.230
Then I have to travel back, you know; I’m
coming from America all the way.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:57.989
So forget about Montpellier.

01:10:57.989 --> 01:11:18.269
Somehow or other try to tell them that let’s
forget about it.

01:11:18.269 --> 01:11:35.159
See, I must also think how far I can go.

01:11:35.159 --> 01:11:57.939
Then

01:11:57.939 --> 01:13:05.590
I have to
go

01:13:05.590 --> 01:14:06.400
back

01:14:06.400 --> 01:15:53.199
to

01:15:53.199 --> 01:16:01.289
India – sixth or so, fifth or sixth, so
hardly any time for Me to prepare to go.

01:16:01.289 --> 01:16:03.900
Also better keep it like that.

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:21.210
Just tell them that it may not be possible;
so I come back on Friday, it would be better.

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:28.010
I can come Saturday night, and Sunday morning
we can have the puja, if you like.

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:36.909
And Saturday arrive, Sunday puja, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday.

01:16:36.909 --> 01:16:39.440
And Thursday morning I go back to London.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.619
Because, you see, I’ll have hardly two weeks
left for Me to go to India.

01:16:44.619 --> 01:16:47.760
It’s too much strain.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:17:00.789
So I won’t be able to do this time.

01:17:00.789 --> 01:17:03.179
They can all come to France.

01:17:03.179 --> 01:17:11.880
They can come to Paris.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.030
Yes.

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.729
They should bring all the people.

01:17:17.729 --> 01:17:20.199
And we have place there for people to live.

01:17:20.199 --> 01:17:25.050
During that time there’s no problem.

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:29.939
France, when am I going?

01:17:29.939 --> 01:17:30.939
Seventeenth?

01:17:30.939 --> 01:17:35.809
Will it be cold now?

01:17:35.809 --> 01:17:36.809
No.

01:17:36.809 --> 01:17:40.400
After some time it will happen that I’ll
settle down in one place, and you’ll all

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.969
have to come there; because I won’t be able
to travel so much, I can tell you this much

01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:47.989
– it’s all right for the time being.

01:17:47.989 --> 01:17:53.309
You must also understand that now, the Mohammed
has gone to the mountains; now the mountains

01:17:53.309 --> 01:17:57.519
have to come to the, to Mohammed.

01:17:57.519 --> 01:17:59.709
All right.

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:00.750
So thank you very much.

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:29.860
You haven’t told Me any one of your problems,
so I think there are no problems!

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:39.500
Tomorrow morning I may not be able to meet
you, so may God bless you all.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:52.769
Give yourself a bandhan now, all of you, properly,
with full attention, with full dignity, with

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:54.570
full movement.

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:56.369
See, full.

01:18:56.369 --> 01:19:06.369
Nothing should be done cheaply.

01:19:06.369 --> 01:19:48.269
I don’t need anything, but just doing it
to please you all.

01:19:48.269 --> 01:19:58.139
In India they asked a question that if She’s
the Goddess, why does She say namaskar to

01:19:58.139 --> 01:19:59.139
everyone?

01:19:59.139 --> 01:21:00.080
They can’t understand that God is saying
namaskar!
