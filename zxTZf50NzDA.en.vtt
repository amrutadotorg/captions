Advice to Sahaja Yogis
on Hygiene and other Topics

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:26.510
Alpe Motta, Italy
May 4, 1986

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:36.190
These are the songs they are sung in Himalayas,
and to be sung here is something really remarkable,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.190
isn’t it?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.240
You brought it all the way to be sung here.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:49.870
Now, I think I have already given you a very,
very long lecture and a speech as you call

00:01:49.870 --> 00:02:00.270
it, but some reactions were very good, and
some could absorb it very well.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.579
But some, they said, were sleeping.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.680
Now these things happen because of negativity.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.970
You have to fight your negativity, because
negativity is the thing that asks questions.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.890
When I am talking I am telling the truth,
absolute truth, but it asks questions and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.390
it reflects.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.690
When it starts reflecting, nothing goes in
the head because you are left with the past

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.680
sentence, and the present you are not with
it.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.010
So the whole thing boils down to something
like an escape, and then you escape and you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.010
sleep off.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.209
I mean, I tried My level best today to put
you onto your conscious mind.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.340
You have to be conscious, you have to be alert;
and that’s the point, is that unless and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.440
until you are conscious you cannot ascend.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.760
Any abnormal person cannot ascend.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.950
You have to normalize yourself.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.900
So many of you had lots of abnormalities which
were brought out and thrown away, and many

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.269
have been cleansed, but now if there are some
still lingering with it, they must work it

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.269
out.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.739
They cannot just go on justifying it.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.400
Normally negative persons attract a negative
personality.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.370
So if you have such a negativity of any kind
within you, you should never sit next to a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.640
negative person, never go near such a person.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.730
Keep away, but stick on to the positive person.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:45.290
Like I said, stick on and support your leaders
without question, without questioning.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.900
But this is the trouble is that you start
fighting your own leader.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.769
If the leader says something to you, you quarrel
with the leader and you argue with the leader,

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.430
so it’s finished.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.849
I speak through the leaders, so you don’t
question it.

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.760
If you question it, then there will be a problem.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.030
You have to stick on with your leaders, who
are positive people.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.599
And if you start questioning them, then you
will be nowhere – no link between you and

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.430
Me.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.910
And this is everywhere: I was told in Switzerland
it is like this, in France now is better but

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.570
used to be like that; everywhere, except for
Italy – I think Italy has the best results.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.979
So don’t fight with your leaders, don’t
argue them.

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.340
Do not reflect about Sahaja Yoga – what
can you say, what do you know, how can you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.870
reflect?

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.740
What is your knowledge?

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.260
Do you question your chemistry teacher when
he says hydrogen has got two atoms or one

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.260
atom?

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.120
Do you?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:09.390
And when you start doing this with your ego,
you are thrown out of the realm of evolution.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.690
So do not reflect, just listen, and try to
take it inside.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.530
These are all mantras; take them inside.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.501
Instead of that you start questioning, arguing
with your leaders, giving them advices.

00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:25.139
Please don’t do it – stop it now.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:33.710
This is not politics, where everybody can
advise, everybody has to say something.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.000
Mostly the bhoots are such; the bhootish people
go on advising and having their own say.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.110
And they go against the leader throughout.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.310
Now specially for the elderly people, I would
say, because you are more grown up sometimes

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.940
than the leaders are.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.650
Then you think you have a right to correct
your leaders – it’s not so.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.170
In Sahaja Yoga it is not how much you are
old, but it is how much you are evolved.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.470
So when you start questioning your leaders
and reflecting on their behavior or anything

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:15.160
like that, and answering them back or also
giving your ideas, you are gone.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.080
It’s like a link.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:27.240
Say, there’s a link between the chakras
and the cells, say it like that.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:37.370
Now if you deny the chakras, how one has to
work it out; because I am connected with them,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.250
and through them you are connected.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.780
But when you deny them, then you fall out.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.229
I know what to do with the leaders, I choose
them, I arrange them, I organize them, I change

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:52.880
them; I know what to do.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.639
Now you people do not challenge them – is
nothing but your ego.

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.630
In India it doesn’t happen at all, doesn’t
happen.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.980
Once Mother has appointed somebody it’s
accepted, because for them this is the truth

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.419
that they have been seeking.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.091
The all other is nonsense, is all complications;
and because you are so complicated, to you

00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:18.530
other things look nice, you think you’re
surrendering your personalities – not at

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.889
all.

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:26.060
Is developing, surrendering yourself to the
sap of life, to the vitality, to the vital

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.680
force of life.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.120
Surrender, accept more, accept more.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:38.820
This ego can never allow you to take inside
anything – be careful on that.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.080
This will never allow you to sleep, this will
never give you peace.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.090
It will never allow you to grow, it will never
take you to your own goal.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.770
So surrender that your ego of yours.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.229
So one thing I have to tell you: don’t fight,
don’t quarrel, don’t question, don’t

00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:06.270
reflect about your leaders to begin with;
or otherwise you will be cut off.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.160
Keep in his good book, try to support him.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.330
Ask him what does he want, what help he needs.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:19.742
The more you get attached to him, the more
you get closer to him, the more you will get.

00:08:19.742 --> 00:08:26.039
But you see, people are very wasteful.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:30.770
They have wasted their lives in drugs, this,
that, all nonsense.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.300
And the women have another bad habit, is to
gossip.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.610
They want to gossip: gossip about this person,
criticize that person.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.199
It’s a very bad habit of women to gossip.

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:52.770
I never pay heed to anyone who gossips, and
I don’t like a person who gossips.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:58.610
So don’t gossip about things – cheaply,
frivolously talking about others.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.170
It’s not necessary you should be educated,
it’s not necessary that you should come

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:08.199
from a very well-bred family, nothing is necessary;
as long as you are a Sahaja yogi, you can

00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:11.120
be a diamond.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.650
But allow yourself to be cut into the diamond.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.080
Allow!

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.940
So the reaction of some people was very good,
they absorbed what I said, they took everything

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.130
inside; but some of them went off to sleep.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.670
Now, if those who were struggling at that
time may not have understood – it’s a

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.130
difficult subject, I told you, it’s a very
subtle subject, doesn’t matter.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:42.591
But those who have been like that should look
after themselves, should find out.

00:09:42.591 --> 00:09:49.360
I’ve found out one thing with the left-sided
people: if they can put a candle near their

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.210
left Swadisthana, a little far, and put one
candle before the photograph, and put left

00:09:55.210 --> 00:10:01.930
hand towards the photograph and right hand
on the Mother Earth, it works.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.220
And the candle at the back should be kept
a little far away because it makes sounds,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.089
it goes this way, that way, burns.

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:14.860
Those who have been taking drugs, not LSD
but other drugs, which are drowsy people who

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:22.970
feel sleepy, whose brains are destroyed by
drug, all those people can benefit a lot by

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:23.970
this.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.790
Do it every day.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:34.900
Going into drug you never felt you’re surrendered
to drugs, never felt that way – which was

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.770
something that was going to kill you completely.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.980
You know how so many people are killed, so
many are dying, but you wanted to do that,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.440
I don’t know, because your ego said, “All
right, go ahead, try this.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.510
You will be the one who nothing will happen
to you.”

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.030
That’s the ego suggests.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.030
So you did it.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.530
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:11:03.060
Whatever has happened has happened, let us
clear it out, because we are seekers.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:12.860
So those who have really felt one in the lecture,
without any questioning, should know that

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.600
they are doing well.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.480
Those who were questioning, reflecting, should
know they have ego, and those who were dozing

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.110
out should know that they are left-sided.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:32.089
Left side is worse than the right side, because
the right side can be easily corrected: it

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:34.190
shows, it shows outside.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.290
People don’t like it.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.280
Such a person is criticized, everybody says
he’s egoistical, he’s this, that.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.580
Everybody knows that such a person goes out
like Hitler.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:49.010
But the left-sided person, you see, is very
pitiable and you’ll have very great pity

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.400
for such a person and you sympathize, and
you get lost with that person.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:00.950
They are more dangerous, and difficult to
be cured, very difficult.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.060
So it’s not a easy task, you have to work
it out.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.549
I am trying My level best.

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:09.620
You should also help Me.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:15.079
I was thinking that if you can start using
a little oil for your head will be a good

00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:16.079
idea, in the night.

00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:17.490
As Sahaja yogis you should.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.049
I think the hairstyle should be changed for
Sahaja yogis.

00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:22.650
This modern fashionable style won’t suit
us.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.480
Because this will, we’ll have all bald heads
one day, I can tell you, and you will see

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.120
the Sahasrara with a big dimple here.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:38.930
Better use some nice coconut oil, rub in your
head nicely, and in the night and in the morning

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.820
– after all, it doesn’t show much – and
comb your hair in a proper way.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.380
Because also I think, if your dresses are
like bhoots, your hair are like bhoots then

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.660
the bhoots will take over thinking, “Oh,
this is a bhoot sitting down here, I better

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.570
take hold of that bhoot.”

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.640
So dress up in a way – shouldn’t have
hair on your forehead at all, keep it straight,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.000
make it nice, and have it absolutely clean
foreheads.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.679
We are Sahaja yogis: we have to change our
dresses, we have to change our styles, we

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:14.160
cannot become fashionable like these stupid
punks.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:21.130
So we are a type, by our hairstyle people
should know that these are Sahaja yogis.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.850
So before you start getting bald, better try
putting some oil in your head.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.319
That’s one very important thing the Sahaja
yogis have to do.

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:34.770
They can take vibrated oil if you like and
I think olive oil is good, but better than

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:42.110
olive oil, I find, it is coconut oil is better
for the growth of the hair.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:47.699
But sometimes you can also put almond oil,
is also good, almond oil for you; because

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:56.189
if you have any problem that you feel exhausted
or your nerves need attention, you are nervous

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:59.620
type of person, then almond oil is good for
you.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:06.640
And for people who have teeth which are troubling
them, they must look after them.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.140
No use going to the dentist, because dentists
create problems.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:18.870
Simple thing is to use olive oil and some
salt, and rub it on your gums nicely every

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.150
day before sleeping.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.690
That will keep your teeth all right.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.300
You’ll be amazed, till today I have not
been to any dentist.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:34.150
Never been to a dentist, and I hope I won’t
go to a dentist.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.880
So, but one thing is that I have certain bad
habits, one of them is that I brush my teeth

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.880
quite often.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.770
But don’t use electrical brushes and all
that, but use brushes or use your fingers,

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:54.209
is the best way is to rub with the salt and
the oil, it’s very good for you.

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:57.610
And then allow the whole thing to come out,
and then wash off.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:05.660
Then the third thing I find in Europe, that
you people do not clear your throats, and

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.830
your tongues, which is another thing very
much against Vishuddhi.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.420
And that must be one of the reasons why your
Vishuddhis are bad.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:20.559
So, though it is not in fashionable here in
the West, but very important thing is to put

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:26.880
your two fingers in the mouth and rub your
– fingers, not the thing, fingers – and

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.370
clean your tongue in such a way that everything
comes out in the morning.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.000
Is important, because that accumulates and
then it rots.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.510
So this has to be done.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.809
And may be that you might think that this
is doing, you make a noise and all that, doesn’t

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:43.809
matter.

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:47.470
You have to clear out your throat; I mean,
that’s how you will keep your Vishuddhis

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.470
very clear.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.130
This is one of the things.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:56.059
And another thing is that you must always
use water as much as possible, for washing:

00:15:56.059 --> 00:16:00.240
when you go for your morning ablution, water
must be used.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.030
The paper is a very dirty and unhygienic habit,
very dirty and unhygienic habit.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.150
But even if you use paper, you must use water
after that.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:16.390
It’s very important that all the time the
water should be used as much as possible;

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:21.830
for Sahaja yogis it is a very, very important
thing.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:32.480
Now for some people who will find that they
are on a subtler level quite on the verge

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:40.260
of collapse, in the way that they still have
those problems that they want to sleep with

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.329
other women and they want to do all these
things: they should give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:45.150
Best is to leave us alone.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.809
We can’t have such useless people with us.

00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:51.610
So they should give up Sahaja Yoga and don’t
trouble us; because we can get thousands and

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.120
thousands in India, we have no problem.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.150
For them it is not difficult, they are already
there.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.020
So those who are still like that, who are
trying to have relations with other women

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:09.431
and having their eyes on other women, and
all the women like that, you see, all this

00:17:09.431 --> 00:17:14.260
kind of maniacs – I call them maniacs only
– should give up Sahaja Yoga and should

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.720
spare us.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.079
This is for definite.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:21.110
Now, we have always been saying that those
who are very negative people will have to

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.449
leave Sahaja Yoga, and the day will come.

00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:29.110
So for all of you it is very necessary that
you should try to clean yourself, and never

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:34.990
sit with a person who is negative.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.440
Never make friendship with a person who is
negative.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.200
Try to be more helpful to a person who is
positive.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:49.240
Clear out yourself, clean out yourself, look
after yourself, respect yourself, love yourself.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.720
Live with your dignity.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:18:00.760
Cheapish thing, frivolous thing, useless thing
should not be done, and make your ego be challenged.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.940
Let somebody insult you and see that, that
you do not answer back.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.560
Just see it, not to get into temper.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.480
Try that your ego doesn’t react.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:22.780
That can be achieved very easily if you try
in the mirror, look at yourself and laugh

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.050
at yourself, make fun of yourself.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.340
What do you think of yourself?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.480
Who are you?

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.880
What do you have?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.030
Nothing.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:40.510
Now today’s lecture was really, was not
only was a great lecture, but also it was

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.150
like mantras, all good for the brain.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:51.280
And I would say that this lecture must be
listened to again and again, and to be taken

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.030
in, not to be questioned.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.910
Not to be questioned – to be taken in, to
be absorbed.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.160
I hope that you understand this.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:09.720
Now after this Sahasrara Puja I hope you people
try to maintain the position you have reached.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:22.030
I would expect all of you to support, to glorify
your leaders and not in any way debase them,

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.020
argue with them, give them ideas.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.100
Even the wives I have said are not to argue
with the leaders.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.910
It’s like pulling each other.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:39.910
Like they said there were some scorpions sent
for investigation from different places.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:45.350
And they saw one jar was open, and they said,
“What is this?

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.800
This, from this jar all the scorpions will
jump out.”

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.840
They said, “They cannot, because one comes
up, the another pulls him down.”

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.670
In the same way we behave.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:04.570
So if there’s a leader, this is ego that
makes you jealous, and this is ego that says

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:09.440
that you know better, you better give a suggestion.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.740
Not that you cannot suggest – people tell
Me also things, but if he doesn’t accept,

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.750
well and good.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.860
That’s a challenge to your ego.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.190
It’s better that he says no to you so that
you see for yourself, “Is it my ego still

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.310
insisting on that position?”

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:32.850
Now, on the second thing that I have said,
that we should not be drawn by convention.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:40.370
Like the convention was that, say now, this
time the English felt, the English leaders

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:48.130
felt – which was a big mistake – that
Italians would be inconvenienced if they stay

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.130
over.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.380
Italians are very large-hearted people, like
Indians are, they’ll be overjoyed if they

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.380
stay over.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.640
But it is the English mind.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.110
It’s the English who cannot tolerate one
person staying for two days.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:05.800
They’ll ask you immediately as you go, “What
time are you leaving?”

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.540
So it is their mind that worked out that way
that it will be inconvenience, because they’ll

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.540
be inconvenienced.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.890
Though they were told “you could stay here
till Monday, there’s no problem, you have

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.310
to just pay just ten pounds”; but – “I
thought” – like that.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:27.160
You see, it’s an English image of being
good to others; because to them anybody staying

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.360
in their house, finished!

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.450
They won’t even allow anybody to come inside
the house.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.430
Let there be snow or anything outside, they’ll
just see and talk to you and then they’ll

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.430
say.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:43.260
I’ve seen it Myself.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:50.440
One day we had, I had gone out; it was snowing,
and I saw a lady standing out on a doorstep

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.700
with a pram, and there was a little baby.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:03.290
And the other lady was an old lady talking
from inside, just from the chink, in a way

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:07.050
that the door was not completely opened out.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.190
And when I came back after an hour or so,
still that lady was standing outside and talking.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.720
This lady didn’t have sense to say that
“you come in.”

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:28.880
But this another lady did not mind it also,
because she must be doing the same!

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.350
So the large-heartedness of anything they
cannot understand.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:38.580
Moreover there was no problem, it was suggested
that you can stay here and you can be here.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.730
Now today we had to hurry up a lot, the whole
thing was quite inconvenienced and we had

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:48.940
to do it, because of a slight mistake that
they should have asked Me.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.430
And I thought you all were staying on Monday,
because it’s logical, it’s sensible.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:57.590
But because of the conception that “we should
not inconvenience” ….

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:03.010
It is not only with English, it is possible
with anyone of you.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:08.520
When you start thinking “I thought,” you
are gone.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.820
So these concepts that you have about things
are actually very dangerous things.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:22.030
I’ve been having experiences of experiences
of these stupid conventions people have.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.420
“I thought.”

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:30.520
They try to be good, but ultimately try to
be nasty.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.030
They are nasty.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.800
So that means there’s something definitely
wrong with the convention they have about

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.740
things.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:48.090
And that’s why people, if they were right
when they were thinking, world would have

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.370
been a different thing.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:56.480
But they are thinking at a level where it’s
just everything is sloping down, and you are

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480
going downward.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.950
As soon as you start thinking, you go downward.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:08.160
Such is the defect of your thinking, because
it is bound by the tags of your conventions.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:14.240
Wherever you think, you see, you are bound
by your conventions, and you go down.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:20.210
I didn’t touch many points today which I
could have touched, like art, I was saying:

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.800
I was amazed, an exuberance like this, a flower
like this makes Me so very happy to see a

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.800
garden.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.190
But to a sophisticated mind is Baroque or
something nonsensical.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:36.100
To them one flower somewhere, because the
rest of the area should be their space for

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.830
their ego.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:50.520
So they cannot see the beauty: “it’s too
much, too much.”

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.950
Even Sahaja Yoga: “there’s too much for
us.”

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.960
What are you, a little baby or what?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.330
What is too much?

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:04.059
You see, as if like a baby we give a bottle,
so much of milk, so much of milk, so “Sahaja

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:05.870
Yoga is too much for me.”

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:11.050
You are dwarves or what?

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.670
And there’s no substance in this kind of
a nonsense.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.200
That’s why “this is sophisticated,”
“this is nice,” criticize everyone.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:24.100
People are so frightened even to decorate
their houses, because it will be criticized.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.080
“Better keep it plain, white.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.400
Just white.”

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.141
Even the nose they don’t like, they want
to cut out the nose, eyes, everything, just

00:25:35.141 --> 00:25:36.350
have plain!

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:47.970
And imagine, it’s the play of the ego which
wants an individuality.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:55.150
How they are in juxtaposition with what they
want to do – see this, clearly.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:00.210
If you go in a garden they’ll have one,
you see, tree somewhere hanging in the air.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.050
This is supposed to be garden.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.110
You say, “Where is the garden”?

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.110
“This – garden.”

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.450
Microscope: “Where is the garden?”

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:16.550
“Oh no, we put only one thing at a point,
you see, so it becomes important.”

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:21.860
So this is only a tree here and then you move
up, there will be another little bush, then

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:27.350
another tree.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.790
Everything is too much, why?

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.160
Because the ego is too much in the head.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.470
That’s why everything is too much for them.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:39.220
This stupidity has to go now.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.340
You have to take whatever is good, too much
you must take, and give up whatever is too

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.550
much in you.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.980
That has to be understood.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:56.101
All these stupid ideas, all kinds of stupid
ideas – like you want to buy a house, so

00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:58.490
it’s all right, you go and buy a house.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:07.940
I went round, and most of the houses are about
seven-and-a-half feet height, but they like

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.940
it.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.940
I said, “Why?”

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:10.940
“It’s very old.”

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.940
I said, “So what?”

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.000
“But it’s an old house, it is this and
that, and the old houses ...”

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.650
“But why do you like?”

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.990
New houses are eight feet, at the most.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.360
So there’s no choice.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.520
But why do you want to have a house which
is old house?

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.980
Victorian houses they don’t like.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.980
Why?

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.540
Because they are not so conventional, they
are not so fashionable.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.670
You must have a house where you should break
your neck.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:46.020
Walk into the bathroom in an awkward way,
you can’t even sit or stand; halfway you

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.540
hang in the air.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.660
That’s the very house of a character.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:57.720
And a character is that which makes you awkward
and feel funny: that person “has character.”

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:04.140
I mean, a person if he’s absurd, he’s
queer, weird, he’s strange, he’s a man

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.010
of character.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.950
This is the situation today.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:13.300
He’s a man of character and he’s weird,
absolutely a strange personality.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.000
How is it?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.340
“You know, he came on a bicycle with a half-pant.”

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.340
I said, “Really?”

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.040
“He’s a man of character.”

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.340
Here he is getting arthritis with it.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:31.800
Being queer, funny stupid things is regarded
as something of personality.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:37.600
Now as Sahaja yogis you have to realize that
you are not that stupid.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:44.990
You are crowned with your Self.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.640
Now you are not going to behave like these
stupid people and their fashions, so give

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.860
it up.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.900
They laugh at you, you laugh at them!

00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:03.703
In a lunatic asylum if you go, all the lunatics
will say, “Oh, so you have also come here

00:29:03.703 --> 00:29:04.703
to join us, isn’t it?”

00:29:04.703 --> 00:29:09.320
They all think they are the wisest, and you
get lost with them.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.990
You start thinking, “Am I a lunatic myself?”

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:18.080
So you all, when you see such a person you
should just laugh at him.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:26.200
Like a lady, you see, she thought her to be
very fashionable, she came with her dress,

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:33.110
you see, very open, her body with all her
bones showing, and this and that.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.420
And we happened to go to see that house, Myself
and My husband.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.550
So as soon as he saw her, he came back and
vomited.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.550
I said, “What’s the matter?’”

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.000
“I saw her – I vomited.”

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.940
And we got into the car, we didn’t enter
even, came away.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:56.690
And she thought she was a very fashionable
lady, showing her bones, all her body – horrible.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.451
Imagine, like a dead body standing before
you!

00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:08.760
But the dead body is regarded as fashionable,
so everybody wants to behave like a dead body.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:17.534
Now you should see the sense in it, otherwise
you are not Sahaja yogis.

00:30:17.534 --> 00:30:25.600
You must see the nonsense that is going on,
and you are not a nonsensical personality.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:32.520
So all these things now, if you see from a
new angle – as I’ve told you now that

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:38.240
you are higher personalities, that you have
achieved a new awareness of your chakras – you’ll

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.850
be amazed, your reactions will be very, very
different.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:46.170
If you see something like this: “Ah!”
you’ll say, “beautiful!”

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:52.290
But till you have those horrible conventions
with you, you cannot.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:57.980
A house which is dilapidated, absolutely going
to fall on your head, is “what a character!”

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:02.570
The whole character will fall on your head!

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:08.410
Absurd ideas people have.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:12.450
And then they want something modern which
is absolutely weird and nonsensical.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:20.320
You see, there was a lady, she built a house
– modern, and we had to climb up her steps,

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.460
and every steps she has divided into smaller,
smaller pieces.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.330
We were so much worried that we’ll all fall
off.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:31.170
You see, every step was made of small, small
pieces like a step, you see, every step was

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.809
made into steps.

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:38.260
So when you put your foot there you don’t
know where you are putting your foot, you

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.260
see.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.680
And she must have spent a lot of money making
that kind of a nonsensical thing; but to her,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.500
she would show everyone, “Now, come along,
see this.”

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.550
I refused to go up.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:50.790
I said, “I have nothing to do.”

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.370
I went back.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.470
Yes, yes, doesn’t matter.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.470
As they show resentment, you must show resentment.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.470
Stupid!

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:07.930
It doesn’t appeal to Me, it doesn’t appeal
to Me these things.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.770
I have seen and I don’t like it these things,
the way there’s one flower hanging somewhere,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.790
and anything if I see, I don’t like it.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.679
I don’t enjoy it at all Myself.

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:22.110
And if I am the criteria, if I am the one
who can judge things, then I would tell you

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.590
I don’t like all this nonsense.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:28.490
The way people dress up these days they look
like clowns to Me, lunatics, like I can say

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:32.240
brats, or you can call them – what do you
call them?

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.240
– tramps.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.230
You cannot make out one from the another.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:40.340
Their lousy pants, you see, some grandfather’s
pant they are wearing, and their grandmother’s

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.170
blouse on top, and the ladies walking on the
street.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:51.690
See, is you feel there’s some funny, queer
people walking across – and they think it’s

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.690
fashionable!

00:32:52.690 --> 00:33:01.630
I think from India we should get all old clothes
here and sell them off for a high price!

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:06.850
It’s very queer.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.190
You just look at it, see from this angle.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:15.240
Standing on the hilltop you look at these
mad people, see how lunatic they are, stupid

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.690
they are, how they are behaving, what is their
fashion.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:28.410
I mean, if you see in the olden times people
used to dress up well with all kinds of frills,

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:35.300
all kinds of things, but this is what they
don’t like.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.190
Whatever is God has given us should be decorated
and respected.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:46.470
I mean, yesterday the way you did the hall,
I mean today the way you did the whole of

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:52.600
the hall and all that, so beautiful it looked,
so nice it looked.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:59.210
But somebody would say, “Oh, let us have
absolutely plain thing for Mother: some dilapidated

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.000
wall behind, which is about to fall down.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.470
That would be real character.”

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:10.270
How can these ideas be acceptable to Sahaja
yogis?

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:15.399
This I just don’t understand.

00:34:15.399 --> 00:34:20.530
And they pay for it.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:25.700
They pay for these conventions and they pay
for all these kinds of odd things, they do

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.000
pay for it.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.919
Supposing there’s a fashion today to have
your hair cut like this on top, they’ll

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:33.050
pay for it.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:38.230
Then you cut them another way, they pay for
it.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.649
You have to pay for all these misdoings also.

00:34:41.649 --> 00:34:47.450
The fashion is: supposing somebody invites
somebody to your house, you must have a different

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:55.530
type of a glass cup and a glass for this,
otherwise you are not all right.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.980
And then what you find, there’s another
group of these hippies and all those have

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:05.600
come, they will give you the dirtiest possible
mugs that you cannot drink anything.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.100
So either you accept this nonsense or that
nonsense.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.590
It’s absolutely absurd!

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:19.860
And you know, I have seen Indians when they
are in England, they just don’t understand,

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:26.550
they just “Cancel them, all right, cancel
them.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.670
They’re mad people.”

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:40.990
The quality of personality is very, very low,
very low, take it from Me – very low.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:51.400
You might have ego, might exist with that
ego, but it’s very low here, accept it.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.790
Innocence is missing, auspiciousness is missing,
cleanliness is missing.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:06.630
The, the attraction of simplicity is missing
– so artificial.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.190
Even the idea of simplicity is artificial.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:17.540
With artificiality how can you have a quality
of human life?

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.580
How can you?

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.590
You become artificial people.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:28.020
So give up all these conventions.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:33.980
I am not here to propagate Indian culture
as such, but I must say if there is any culture

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.930
it is in India, because this is no culture.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:44.680
All becoming – if you walk about, I mean
you look like, when I see the people around,

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.760
they look like host of mad people walking.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.000
You see them on the streets, not one person
is normal.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.670
America is even worse.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:37:02.940
They must be doing like this, or this like
this; not one person has a proper face.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:08.710
Is a fact, I tell you!

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:13.440
With Sahaja Yoga your quality has come up,
it has come up.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:22.310
You’ve become that now, so great.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:28.390
That’s why you do not feel here there is
lakshmi.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:32.120
You have money, but no lakshmi.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.370
There’s no beauty of that.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:45.370
It’s so desolate, like a barren land.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:52.320
Your ego has blown off everything that was
beautiful.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.480
You could not tolerate anybody’s art, so
you would not have anything artistic things

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.480
in the house.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:07.630
You need not have many things at all, so you
have plastics.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.150
Beauty has run away from your lives.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:15.810
When you talk also it’s fashionable to be
arrogant.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:26.780
Imagine – to be arrogant, to be very dry:
there’s no beauty in it.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:41.830
Is all put-up show; there’s no bravery in
it, nothing sublime.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:47.580
On the subtle form you have lost it, that’s
why in the gross form you don’t see it.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:57.780
Whatever you have lost inside is shown outside
– bankruptcy, complete bankruptcy.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:02.080
So when you see that with others – when
I am saying “you” I am meaning the others,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.500
those who are not yet Sahaja yogis in the
West – try to understand they are at a much

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:13.260
lower level than you are, and don’t take
to their ideas and their ways and methods.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.760
Just keep yourself aloof.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.760
And then you will see they’ll run after
you.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:25.820
Ego is like a donkey: if somebody is ahead
of them, they know somebody is ahead of them,

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.310
then they bend their head to that.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:37.290
And if they see somebody is behind them, then
they kick.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:41.540
So you have your dignity, you have your special
style, you live with a special style.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.930
Don’t be one of them.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.990
Dress up properly in a proper way.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:54.619
You may have only two shirts, you may have
only three shirts, you need not have many;

00:39:54.619 --> 00:40:11.470
but have in something sensible, normal, comfortable,
and also which is not jarring to others.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:16.990
We are the ones who are going to encourage
our art, we are the ones who are going to

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.290
bring back all that is lost.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:25.490
We can’t have Rembrandt anymore, we cannot
have Leonardo da Vinci, we cannot have Michelangelo

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.750
again – finished them all completely.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.490
But everybody thinks they are Michelangelo!

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:51.410
We can’t even have, say, Gorky; we can’t
have William Blake, can we – of that courage?

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:58.200
We cannot have Abraham Lincoln, can we have?

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:05.160
All dwarfs, useless people.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.740
You scratch them and you find they are good
for nothing, useless.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:14.810
Out of you all these great people have to
come out now.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:17.820
And their speciality about them, they had
their own personality, and they would not

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.280
give way to any fashions or anything.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.440
They wouldn’t give way to any cheap popularity.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:35.130
Out of you people all these great personalities
are to be born.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:42.030
So for you and for your progeny you have to
think, what are we doing in such a great work

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.030
as it is.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.911
It’s not only for your enjoyment that we
have a seminar, nice music, nice food, nice

00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:51.910
place, we come, we enjoy – no.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:42:04.230
Enjoyment is just an advertising department.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:13.220
You have to really work hard inside, not outside.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:20.250
No arguments of any kind.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.640
Useless!

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:29.609
Simple thing, if I say I have to carry, say,
this box, somebody will come out and start

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:32.310
saying, “All right, then I think we should
get a van.”

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.990
“No, but a van is too much.”

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.460
“Then what should we do?”

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:39.690
They’ll go on arguing till that the box
is gone, everything is done, and I come back

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.849
and say, “Now, what are you doing?”

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:45.460
They are still discussing how to take the
box – it’s already gone!

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:58.849
Such wasteful habits we should give up.

00:42:58.849 --> 00:43:02.090
We have to have new wisdom within us.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.500
All this old wisdom, you just throw it away.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.780
Unless and until you do that, your ego won’t
go away.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:17.590
It won’t leave you, unless and until you
decide to throw away all those ideas which

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:22.770
to you appear to be the ego.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:30.950
You have to be like children, trying to learn
something new all the time; we are to be open

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.550
to learn something new all the time.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.400
You have to learn – you have lost it.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.920
You had something that you have lost, so many.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.849
Instead of going ahead, you have lost it.

00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:48.200
You were doing all right; if you had remained
on the right path you would have achieved,

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.280
because after all, some countries are traditionally
very old.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.280
They also got lost – like Greece, you can
say is lost.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:02.790
Horrible Greek tragedies: I mean, you sit
down and cry for nothing at all.

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:06.880
Nothing has happened, everything is perfect;
people just go and sit down and cry.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.430
It’s like you make somebody say that “This
one is dead.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:14.020
Let us now feel that he’s dead.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.119
Sit down, all of us should cry.”

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:19.290
Stupid as that!

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:24.480
It’s all artificially-created problems and
artificially-created gloom, because you have

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.690
no real gloom, you have no real problem.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:33.000
You have got food to eat, you’ve got everything
– that’s why you are creating problems

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.369
for yourself.

00:44:34.369 --> 00:44:39.859
That’s why you need psychiatrists, you need
drugs, you need this, you need that; because

00:44:39.859 --> 00:44:45.130
you have no problems, so you want to have
some problems – as simple as that.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.040
Those who have problem have to fight with
it.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.190
They have no time for all these nonsensical
things.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:53.190
You have too much time.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:58.150
All your problems are solved as far as the
material things are concerned, but still you

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:00.350
are very much involved into it.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:10.920
So now face it, face it clearly, that we are
not that any more.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.410
We are different people.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:20.680
We are no more worms in the mud but we are
lotuses, we have fragrance, we have powers,

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:25.470
we are specially blessed.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:28.310
We have a special sense of joy.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:40.930
Let’s enjoy that and give it to others and
be glorified with it, feel the dignity of

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:43.230
it.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:47.520
I’m sure it is going to work out this time.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:55.950
I have done My level best, I think, and this
lecture should really go through you all.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:59.860
All right, any questions?

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:04.180
(Please have some water.)

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:08.109
Any questions you have?

00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:11.349
(Water.)

00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:19.750
They might be thinking that I’ll drink from
here!

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.690
Modern idea maybe that I drink from here!

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:30.869
So there’s no need to have glass, Mother
may like to drink from there!

00:46:30.869 --> 00:46:48.849
All right, any questions?

00:46:48.849 --> 00:47:02.340
In thoughtless awareness.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:08.150
Now keep it up, keep it up in thoughtless
awareness – absolutely you’re blasted.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:10.099
Keep it up.

00:47:10.099 --> 00:47:12.060
Keep yourself blasted.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.260
That is this ego business.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:19.070
Little bit is still there, rudimentary: keep
it out.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:30.200
This is meditation, where there’s no ego
any more, you are in thoughtless awareness,

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.190
absolutely stunned.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.190
Can’t think.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:38.750
But that I have done, is not good – you
should do it.

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:43.670
That is the point I am commenting on.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.050
Have your own personality.

00:47:45.050 --> 00:48:07.780
If punks could behave like that, why can’t
you behave sensibly?

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:19.841
And also I have to say few words about how
we behave in our day-to-day life; because

00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:25.170
a Mother has to see that they are, children
are not to be ill-bred.

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:29.410
People should not say that Sahaja yogis are
ill-bred, you see.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:36.400
Now the first sign of an ill-bred child is
that he leaves his bed in a mess.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:42.220
He leaves all his things in a mess.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.270
While coming I saw all the beds.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:50.880
What are we doing here?

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.010
Nothing.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:58.890
So put yourself into a discipline of leading
a neat life.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:02.349
As a Mother I have to tell you this.

00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:08.720
It takes hardly ten to fifteen minutes, but
just tell yourself this is meditation, do

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.880
in meditative way.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:17.280
We in India think that the Western people
are extremely neat and tidy.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.090
Really!

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.090
They can’t believe it.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:24.800
They think you are on top of the world, you
must be the neatest people ever lived.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:34.610
They’ll say ten times “thank you”, but
even once you will not keep your bed all right.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.210
Your things should be neat.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:46.670
You must keep yourself neat, appear neatly.

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:51.270
Then second thing I have seen, noticed this,
which is told by many people which I have

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:54.390
also noticed, that you go to somebody’s
house.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:50:00.980
Then an ill-bred person will start using the
phone without asking.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:07.440
Certain things are important to understand,
like entering into the kitchen, eating everything.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:18.200
It’s a very common thing people are noticing
this, that you get the food – like paupers,

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:24.220
like beggars they come in the house.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:30.340
I had at least twenty-one bottles of honey
which people had given Me as present, and

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:35.820
when My son-in-law came there was not even
one bottle to give him honey.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:36.820
So who ate?

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.210
All the Sahaja yogis who came ate the honey.

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:47.089
I mean, it’s all right, but you must ask.

00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:49.530
You polish off everything in the house.

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:53.710
All right, you have come, if there is a food
cooked for you, just have your food.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:51:03.960
If you
go in the larder or you go anywhere, you find

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.610
everything is missing.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:13.200
You buy from the whole mart, you find everything’s
polished off.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.359
So an ill-bred person can be made out like
that.

00:51:18.359 --> 00:51:24.790
But you’ll be surprised, a good-breeding
person, even if this much is left of another

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:30.810
person, that person will keep it and keep
it till it is passed over.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:35.890
I’ll tell you about My own husband who is
– he need not worry about this thing, but

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:41.410
if he knows we have something of another person,
he’ll put it in lock and key and see every

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:49.150
time it is there, till he returns it to him.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:57.980
And same I can say about My children, or anybody
I know of.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:03.510
But this is beggarish that you take somebody’s
things, misuse it, throw away where you feel

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.330
like, break everything.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:12.890
But I have seen with My own things; so when
the leaders have been complaining to Me that

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:17.560
“they come to our houses, they polish off
everything from our fridges” and all that,

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.340
I was not surprised.

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:28.839
The Sahaja Yoga has become like a resort for
all the beggars and the paupers of the world,

00:52:28.839 --> 00:52:29.839
because it is free.

00:52:29.839 --> 00:52:37.349
All the poor people come down to Sahaja Yoga,
and you have to nourish them and look after

00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:38.349
them.

00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:40.119
It should not be such.

00:52:40.119 --> 00:52:47.920
You may be poor, but you must have dignity.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.580
Even the servants are in India better.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:56.100
They wouldn’t touch your things without
asking.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:02.660
They have much more breeding.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:12.400
An ill-bred person is a person who is a rude
person, arrogant person.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.010
You can say the same thing in a proper manner.

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:24.890
As a Mother, to give Me real glory is that,
that people should say that you are very well-brought-up

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.800
children.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:43.540
A kind of system must exist.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.020
A spartan system.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.070
It’s a spartan system.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:53.130
It’s not all a sort of a lousy system, it’s
a spartan system.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:56.010
You are yogis.

00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:03.750
Should be neat, tidy, all the time clean,
with few things.

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:10.240
Like in India, people are quite shocked: you
carry such big, big bags, and it carries all

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:13.761
the – for ladies specially – all the paints
and this and that.

00:54:13.761 --> 00:54:20.020
Where are you going to use before the villagers
there, these paints?

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.690
They don’t understand.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.130
All these things we have to see for ourselves.

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:39.020
We have to be dignified, we have to be people
with a kind of a personality.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.280
Supposing somebody is a saint.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:48.220
He might be a poor man, but you can make him
out by his dignity.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:53.970
There was a saint called Tukarama whom, which
you have heard about him – this all may

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:59.290
be, I don’t know, was coming from his music.

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:02.760
He was poor and very generous also.

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:08.210
He used to give away everything, and always
left with very little.

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:17.800
So Shivaji Maharaj, the great Shivaji came
down to his place, brought lots of ornaments

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.230
and things and presentations, and gave it
to his wife and children.

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:23.770
He was out.

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:26.720
She was very happy to wear all these things
because he gave.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.200
He said, “This is ...” Of course, in the
beginning she also said that it’s not all

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.200
right.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:36.420
But he said, “No, I am just trying to sort
of pay my respects to you, this, that, and

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.420
give.”

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.420
And she wore it.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.420
He came.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:45.450
He said, “No, I am a saint.

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:46.450
You take this.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.620
You are a king, and you have to live like
a king.

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:56.310
All right, as a king you can have it.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:56:01.109
But not – as a saint I don’t need all
these things, my wife doesn’t need all these

00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:02.109
things.

00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:07.810
Because you are living like a king, you – maybe
you are a realized soul also, but you are

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:14.290
a king, so live like a king.”

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:21.990
But one has to realize that in Sahaja Yoga
you are not to move like a barren personality

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.990
also.

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:27.530
You have to be properly dressed, properly
appearing.

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:36.300
You should not look like beggars, but you
should look like dignified people of the society.

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:42.440
Now for example, as you know I am the Goddess,
and the Goddess has to wear I don’t know

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.380
how many ornaments just to adorn Her chakras.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:51.530
I mean, I have lots of ornaments Myself of
My own.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:59.940
But only for puja I wear, otherwise I don’t
wear: I am supposed to wear lots of things.

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.940
Why?

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:07.440
Because it may not be that – all right,
may be dignified, but may not be that all

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.140
right to wear all those things all the time.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.440
But I am supposed to wear.

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:20.700
Like You are supposed to wear many more things
in the hand here, rings on the feet, everything.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:28.730
All the time You have wear gold in the – what
do you call the – you don’t have that

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:33.460
ornament here which we tie up like a belt.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:38.720
But I don’t do it.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:46.190
I keep it to a marginal point; only in puja
I wear some things out of it.

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:55.480
So you must have that discretion: what to
wear, how to wear, how far to go, how to look

00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:06.900
dignified, how to be well-bred, so that you
glorify the breeding of your Mother.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:16.340
This time I hope when you all come to India,
you will notice all these things among Indians.

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:22.940
You will never see them eating, you’ll never
see them having their baths, you will never

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:26.300
see them sleeping.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:30.640
You don’t know how they live, where they
live, how they work out, everything.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.010
They are just there on the spot whenever you
are there.

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:36.170
Isn’t it true?

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:41.590
They take their baths, they finish everything,
early in the morning, about four o’clock

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:47.120
or five o’clock they are out – spartan.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:54.450
And always clean: whether he’s a villager,
whether he is a scheduled caste or a brahmin

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:59.940
or anything, they’re all neatly dressed,
you cannot make them out.

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:08.050
Clean white clothes they’ll wear, clean
white cap they will have.

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:18.589
They’ll never have dirty clothes.

00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:27.579
So this is another side, which is not so sublime
on your side and not so subtle and, but it’s

00:59:27.579 --> 00:59:40.310
very important; because whatever is in the
subtle expresses outside.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:51.490
In all your behavior this would shine, like
thousand facets of a diamond, because you

00:59:51.490 --> 01:00:00.830
have attended now the Sahasrara Day – let’s
see; what are the thousand facets will show.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:13.640
Love each other, respect each other, respect
yourself, and all the time say one mantra

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.260
within yourself, “I am a Sahaja yogi.”

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.859
It says everything about your responsibilities,
what are your aspirations, what you are.

01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:34.290
You
are a Sahaja yogi, being reborn by Adi Shakti

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:46.110
Herself.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:50.700
Any personal problems you have you should
write to Me, and I’ll try to answer.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:55.359
If I do not answer, then think that answer
I have managed.

01:00:55.359 --> 01:00:59.150
If I do not answer, then think that I have
managed the answer; but if there’s anything

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.380
to be suggested I will definitely inform you.

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.590
Any other problem.

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:10.329
But like a lady today came, she was crying
about her husband.

01:01:10.329 --> 01:01:14.820
This she did before also, again today she
is crying – she’ll go mad.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:18.800
A Sahaja yogi should not cry.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.999
Overcome your problem, try to handle your
husband, try to handle everything.

01:01:23.999 --> 01:01:28.880
I do not very much like the divorce part of
it, but if somebody’s a gone case is all

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880
right.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.480
If I say it’s a gone case, you divorce.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:39.670
But unnecessarily, just because there’s
not yet proper understanding, one should not

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:41.470
cry, weep and do all these things.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:52.820
On the contrary, one should try to overcome
your own personal problems, because you have

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:58.810
powers.

01:01:58.810 --> 01:01:59.980
And You can write to Me.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.590
Not very long letters, but I get lost!

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:16.339
Ha, really, I get lost!

01:02:16.339 --> 01:02:23.630
In the morning there are so many letters for
Me to read, one better than the other, and

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:29.320
My husband also get a big post.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:36.099
But he says, “Nobody writes me love letters,
they all write about their bills to be paid.”

01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:53.839
I said, “It’s just the same!”

01:02:53.839 --> 01:03:04.349
(You may translate this, Gregoire, if they
want.)

01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:39.430
Letters … full of
problems …

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:44.300
I said, “I have to pay for their love.”

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.839
That’s what it is.

01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:55.650
But children write very sweet letters.

01:03:55.650 --> 01:04:01.550
They just make some painting or something,
or some flowers and few things there, that’s

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:02.550
all.

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:08.200
They’ll make the heart and put Me there,
or something like that; very sweet, sweet

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.740
things they do.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:16.890
And just the joy and happiness, you see, they
express it.

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:20.060
Never their problems – they have no problems,
children don’t have, they are not complicated.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.930
We catch hold of the problems, that’s the
trouble is.

01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:30.310
They have no problems of any kind.

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:35.380
So you have not told Me, any one of you, anything
that you want Me to be done.

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:40.880
Now only thing, at the last I would like you
to listen to Warren who will read it out to

01:04:40.880 --> 01:05:05.079
you, the programs we are going to have in
this summer-time.

01:05:05.079 --> 01:05:06.750
Come forward.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:09.930
…. Yes, now.

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:20.440
…. No, no, no, then I go to Houston.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.520
…. Yes.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.250
And then visiting London, that’s all.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.250
…. Yes.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:27.210
…. Twenty-seventh I think, I go.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:28.210
Yes, twenty-seventh.

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.210
….

01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:31.140
That’s not definite, but we’ll see.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.619
In the evening.

01:05:32.619 --> 01:05:33.619
…. Puja.

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:36.589
That’s the puja for Belgium and Holland.

01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:42.210
…. No, better to have puja at a place where
we have the Monday program.

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:43.410
In Belgium.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.810
No, just after that.

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:48.810
About fourteenth I come back?

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.339
So that is what, a Saturday or a Sunday?

01:05:51.339 --> 01:05:52.339
…. Spanish people are here still?

01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:53.339
Or they are gone?

01:05:53.339 --> 01:05:55.600
…. So, they would like Me to be there for
a weekend, or for the weekdays?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.540
That’s the point to be decided.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:03.869
…. One day …. So, what is – Spanish
people, are they more available on weekends

01:06:03.869 --> 01:06:04.869
or weekdays?

01:06:04.869 --> 01:06:05.869
Weekdays, weekdays.

01:06:05.869 --> 01:06:08.930
So I can fly on, say, Tuesday.

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:20.650
On Monday I can fly, and Tuesday we can have
a program: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday – three

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:23.230
days, all right?

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.230
Yes.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:37.950
And then I can – we have to have a puja,
so on Friday.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:47.140
Or I go on Monday would be better: Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.690
And Friday I can go to ….

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:58.100
I can come Sunday evening, and Monday morning
you’ll have the puja, it’s better.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:06.290
And we have programs after the puja; it’s
much better to have programs afterwards.

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:10.300
Then My vibrations are also released.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.309
So Monday morning we’ll have puja.

01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:26.290
…. Have you given them the saris and things
like that?

01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:27.390
No, no.

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:29.040
No, no, no.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.349
Sunday I’m coming back.

01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:32.349
No.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:35.250
Then next Sunday is what?

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:39.849
What is the following Sunday?

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:41.290
Ah, twenty-first.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.290
Monday.

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:44.160
Puja, morning Monday.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:51.270
Or you can have it Sunday night if you like,
puja, which will suit better – Sunday night.

01:07:51.270 --> 01:08:00.150
For puja, Sunday night would be better.

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:01.690
So Sunday morning I’ll go.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:04.230
Twenty-first Sunday morning I come, all right?

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:05.230
All right.

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:08.000
Then Sunday we have puja, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday I could be there.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:17.779
Thursday I’ll go to Montpellier, and I can
return from there to London.

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:18.950
How many days?

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:20.520
Three days are sufficient?

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520
Three.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520
…. Keep it four now.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.830
So I’ll reach there on Sunday; Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday – it’s all right, four days.

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.000
Thursday morning I’ll go to Montpellier.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:44.569
Thursday evening we’ll have program there,
and then … Is there a direct flight?

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:52.960
…. But is there a flight from there to London?

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.350
It’s a rather out-of-the-way thing.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.350
Is there?

01:08:56.350 --> 01:09:00.659
So why not do Montpellier first, and then
go to Spain?

01:09:00.659 --> 01:09:07.080
But from Montpellier to Spain, is there a
flight or not?

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:11.579
That you find out first of all.

01:09:11.579 --> 01:09:22.559
But you keep it that time, about that time;
definite we’ll let you know, once we have

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:34.410
done with the Montpellier.

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.390
…. No flight?

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:43.719
…. But in any case you keep this program
with them.

01:09:43.719 --> 01:09:48.020
Otherwise I’ll do it earlier or later, whatever
it is.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.029
First of all keep this program, definite.

01:09:51.029 --> 01:10:15.630
See, Montpellier even if I don’t do, France
is there, it’s all right.

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:20.059
I can do it later on, doesn’t matter.

01:10:20.059 --> 01:10:27.880
But this I have to do, Spain, properly.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.880
All right?

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:35.559
Rather awkward, I think, to go from there,
isn’t it?

01:10:35.559 --> 01:10:37.510
There’s no flight.

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:40.760
It’s too much for Me.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:51.230
Then I have to travel back, you know; I’m
coming from America all the way.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:57.989
So forget about Montpellier.

01:10:57.989 --> 01:11:18.269
Somehow or other try to tell them that let’s
forget about it.

01:11:18.269 --> 01:11:35.159
See, I must also think how far I can go.

01:11:35.159 --> 01:11:57.939
Then

01:11:57.939 --> 01:13:05.590
I have to
go

01:13:05.590 --> 01:14:06.400
back

01:14:06.400 --> 01:15:53.199
to

01:15:53.199 --> 01:16:01.289
India – sixth or so, fifth or sixth, so
hardly any time for Me to prepare to go.

01:16:01.289 --> 01:16:03.900
Also better keep it like that.

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:21.210
Just tell them that it may not be possible;
so I come back on Friday, it would be better.

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:28.010
I can come Saturday night, and Sunday morning
we can have the puja, if you like.

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:36.909
And Saturday arrive, Sunday puja, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday.

01:16:36.909 --> 01:16:39.440
And Thursday morning I go back to London.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.619
Because, you see, I’ll have hardly two weeks
left for Me to go to India.

01:16:44.619 --> 01:16:47.760
It’s too much strain.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:17:00.789
So I won’t be able to do this time.

01:17:00.789 --> 01:17:03.179
They can all come to France.

01:17:03.179 --> 01:17:11.880
They can come to Paris.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.030
Yes.

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.729
They should bring all the people.

01:17:17.729 --> 01:17:20.199
And we have place there for people to live.

01:17:20.199 --> 01:17:25.050
During that time there’s no problem.

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:29.939
France, when am I going?

01:17:29.939 --> 01:17:30.939
Seventeenth?

01:17:30.939 --> 01:17:35.809
Will it be cold now?

01:17:35.809 --> 01:17:36.809
No.

01:17:36.809 --> 01:17:40.400
After some time it will happen that I’ll
settle down in one place, and you’ll all

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.969
have to come there; because I won’t be able
to travel so much, I can tell you this much

01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:47.989
– it’s all right for the time being.

01:17:47.989 --> 01:17:53.309
You must also understand that now, the Mohammed
has gone to the mountains; now the mountains

01:17:53.309 --> 01:17:57.519
have to come to the, to Mohammed.

01:17:57.519 --> 01:17:59.709
All right.

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:00.750
So thank you very much.

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:29.860
You haven’t told Me any one of your problems,
so I think there are no problems!

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:39.500
Tomorrow morning I may not be able to meet
you, so may God bless you all.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:52.769
Give yourself a bandhan now, all of you, properly,
with full attention, with full dignity, with

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:54.570
full movement.

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:56.369
See, full.

01:18:56.369 --> 01:19:06.369
Nothing should be done cheaply.

01:19:06.369 --> 01:19:48.269
I don’t need anything, but just doing it
to please you all.

01:19:48.269 --> 01:19:58.139
In India they asked a question that if She’s
the Goddess, why does She say namaskar to

01:19:58.139 --> 01:19:59.139
everyone?

01:19:59.139 --> 01:21:00.080
They can’t understand that God is saying
namaskar!
