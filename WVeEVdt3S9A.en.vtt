00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:09.828
One has to be in the present.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.450
And how do you do it?

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:18.924
Not by listening to any lecture 
or going to any library to find out.

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:23.434
You cannot do it, again, 
with this brain that is today.

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:31.033
You have to have a brain 
which has that spark in it,

00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:34.170
that light in it – enlightened brain.

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:36.263
You are to be an enlightened person.

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.297
Unless and until you are enlightened

00:00:38.418 --> 00:00:40.324
you cannot see your way through,

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:43.430
you are walking in the dark, 
really you are walking in the dark.

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:46.764
And when this light comes into you…

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:51.138
that is the light within us, 
placed there all the time.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:52.883
Is the light of our Spirit.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.158
It has to come in our attention.

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:58.678
And God has arranged everything for us, everything.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:04.625
There’s a way of our germination

00:01:04.745 --> 00:01:08.468
which has to take place, 
and when it takes place

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.292
you can feel that Spirit in your attention.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.886
Now there is another misunderstanding I find 
[that] people have about Spirit:

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.274
they think Spirit is an energy.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:26.552
It is not! It’s not an energy.

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.472
Energy can be transformed, it can be changed,

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:32.358
it can be evolved, it can be handled and all that.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:35.333
Spirit is not! Spirit is absolute!

00:01:35.453 --> 00:01:38.439
It cannot be compared 
with anything else that you know of.

00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:40.634
It is an absolute thing.

00:01:40.755 --> 00:01:43.094
It resides in your heart.

00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:47.300
It’s the reflection of God Almighty, 
within ourselves.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:51.509
And you cannot call it an energy.

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:56.678
Energy can be finished off, spent away, 
it can disappear into thin air.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.096
Not the Spirit.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:01:59.676
It’s a permanent entity.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.527
It is absolute, by itself, and it cannot 
be compared with anything else.

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:07.676
I mean, just to give an analogy, 
one can say something,

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.888
but that’s a different point – just to give.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.930
But you cannot compare an absolute 
with anything that is relative.

00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:17.680
So that’s an absolute thing within you,

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:24.078
which resides in your heart, and when 
this residual power of Kundalini rises,

00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:32.447
it ignites the attention within you 
with this spark of the Spirit.

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:36.678
Now, supposing, this light is here, 
take it [as an example].

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.329
If you put on this light

00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:42.242
– of course this light is an energy so you 
cannot compare with anything you know,

00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:45.202
that’s the trouble, but still 
[if] you say this is the light –

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:47.989
now this light enlightens 
this whole atmosphere

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.139
and we start seeing things here clearly.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:00.678
But do you think that light which is there 
is the one that is your attention?

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.242
Not at all.

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:07.287
Your attention is enlightened by that light.

00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:13.077
The light enlightens your attention;

00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:19.592
by that attention you can feel 
the All-pervading Power,

00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:22.210
the Divine Power, the energy of God,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.413
the Divine Energy of God, 
the energy of love of God.

00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:29.499
You can feel it because it’s a connecting link.

00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:32.134
Spirit is the connecting link.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:37.247
But it is completely absolute.

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:46.829
It just connects you to that All-pervading Power, 
that All-pervading Power.

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.073
I think we have talked about Creation

00:03:50.193 --> 00:03:59.221
when we said that, 
the whole Parabrahma became

00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:05.291
the energy and God Almighty, which was

00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:10.555
lost in the Parabrahma, means 
[in] a sleeping state, became the Witness.

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:15.217
Now this Witness is 
in the heart of human beings.

00:04:15.342 --> 00:04:17.971
This Witness is all the time there.

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:21.382
When it disappears you do not exist!

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.228
So it is not an energy.

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:24.551
One has to understand.

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:27.003
Actually someone has written 
a book on Sahaja Yoga

00:04:27.124 --> 00:04:29.880
and when I was going through it 
I was shocked to read that

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.015
he thinks that Spirit is an energy!

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:38.705
So, energy, the Shakti, 
is not that Spirit

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:40.973
and the Spirit is not Shakti.

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:47.267
They have to meet. 
They have to meet so that

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:52.305
the enlightenment in human beings, 
[of] the chitta (attention), takes place.
