00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:17.750
I am very happy to see so many people here
to know about Sahaja Yoga in all its details.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.869
But in this short time, what can you be told?

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:36.190
That firstly you got your realization, you
felt the cool breeze all right, and that it

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.940
was an experience.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.720
But beyond this experience you have to settle
down.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:54.060
It is very, very important that you must have
desire to settle down.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.489
You don’t know the importance of your personality.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.120
You are the one who’ll save this world.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:22.320
Because the salvation of the whole world is
not possible with Myself; and you people who

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.229
will be really developed, it will be such
a force.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:41.526
I told about England yesterday, another thing
is that England is the heart of the universe,

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:42.740
I think.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.570
Everything circulates from here, whatever
happens small or big, it circulates.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:02.130
It is not that only England has many newspapers
or television centers but somehow it circulates

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.009
everywhere.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.680
I used to think only in India, it’s not
so.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.450
I’ve seen everywhere, every country, there's
news about England.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.050
Even in America, even in South America, I
was surprised how people are worried about

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.830
England so much that they want to know what’s
happening in England.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:39.070
My own experience is this, that they get so
upset with the things that upset your country,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:53.480
not only that but anything that happens of
a very small importance is noted down and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.770
they always tell Me, “Mother, we have seen
in the newspaper, we have seen in the television.”

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:07.330
America is such a vast country and also the
newspapers are vast, and their television

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.000
is impossible to gauge anything out of it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Horrible.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.050
What they say also language wise, we are not
so good for American language.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.050
So, they’re little exclusive people, I think
their idea is to be exclusive.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:39.870
For example, if they produce anything electrical,
it has to have 110 watt, while normally people

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.982
have 220, so nobody can buy their electrical
productions.

00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:49.620
Now they have started a small production of
that.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.220
They try to be exclusive, while I think England
is not like that, it’s not exclusive, it’s

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.860
not only keeping all its things to itself.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:09.280
This is something, a very great quality that
England has.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.000
It has many other qualities, as I told you
yesterday, there has to be self-esteem.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.489
One quality is that they never go to extremes.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.400
I mean we had some hippies, we had little
bit of this and that, but they don’t go

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400
to extremes.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:39.150
But in America or any other country, if something
starts it really blasts the whole atmosphere.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:51.300
This balancing in England is something really
very surprising.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.420
Also they are disciplined people, they have
their own discipline, and with their discipline,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.420
they…

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:09.690
like people who are disciplined, who are very
much in time, properly dressed for the occasion

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.930
and I’m not trying to just praise you, but
this is My observation.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.620
And in this observation I find, once Sahaja
Yoga settles down in England, it will spread

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.000
all over the world.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.520
Then I don’t have to run about in every
country.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:34.610
That’s very important, that it should settle
down here, that is you should all understand

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.750
the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:50.229
When I first came to London, My husband had
a job and I started My work with seven people,

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.199
out of them I think five were hippies.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:04.530
But immediately they got rid of their drugs,
alcohols and all that.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.560
Immediately.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.039
Next day they were different people.

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:15.180
But how to prove, how to tell, was a problem.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.770
They improved so much, unbelievable.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.130
And I felt very close to them that they are
the people who have achieved it in such a

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.270
short time.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.840
For which, I think otherwise I have to work
very hard for others.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.139
They became hippies because of some sort of
a fashion maybe?

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.830
But English don’t take to fashions so much.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.830
I don’t know why.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.810
Why they had become hippies, and they were
very well educated, all were professors, this,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.810
that.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.640
And they said that we have taken to this hippiedom
because we wanted to experiment as to what

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.050
it is.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:07.330
I said “You can’t experiment with a snake,
that ‘let the snake bite us and then we’ll

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.330
experiment.’

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.419
Once it bites you, you are finished.”

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:22.780
All these things have been always, kept Me
attached to London and I have been here for

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.330
twenty years continuously.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:34.520
But the work that we did, I don’t know why
it did not reach intellectuals, and newspaper

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:42.229
people, while all other stupid people who
came here were so much enamored, and were

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:52.889
given so much prominence, everybody was talking
about them.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:58.669
So that’s how the London is based about
Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:04.910
It is a spontaneous happening within, a spontaneous.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:12.600
Yesterday you saw, I didn’t do anything,
it just worked spontaneously, because it is

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.690
there and it has to be awakened, that’s
all.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:24.450
But I know also people who have been cured,
have been completely cured of very difficult

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.120
diseases with Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.520
It’s a fact, it’s not just I’m boasting
about it, but it’s a fact.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.280
It’s a very powerful thing within us.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:47.730
This power of Kundalini is extremely, extremely
kind, loving, affectionate and effective.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:57.130
As I said it’s your Mother, and when it
acts, it works so well, it works so well.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:08.160
It is impossible to avoid Kundalini awakening
once it has been awakened.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:16.020
But I know some people who have been able
to defy it, maybe because of basically they

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:24.920
were cheats or immoral or some sort of people,
but they were very, very few.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:33.459
Mostly I have seen people have grown to great
heights with Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:41.100
Today I want to tell you a special thing about
Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:54.840
That in Sahaja Yoga, slowly, slowly you’ll
find, most of your problems, most of your,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:06.269
I should say enemies, as in Sanskrit they
are called shadripus, all these will just

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:07.269
disappear.

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:13.410
You’ll be amazed, how they are just disappearing.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:23.870
Jealousy, anger, racism, all kinds of stupid
things that are lingering, of which you may

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.200
not be even aware, just drop out.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:36.190
And you feel such love and such affection
for everyone who comes across.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.959
You try to give them Sahaja Yoga, you try
to tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:44.130
They may like it, they may not like it.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:54.040
English are little conservative, so that conservatism
has gone a little bit sometimes, too much.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.649
There’s no harm in talking about Sahaja
Yoga.

00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:05.640
I have seen people who have gurus, of the
worst type, worst type.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.470
One lady was sitting next to Me…

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.030
It’s quite warm today?

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:17.360
They told Me it’s very cold.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.030
That’s England [laughs].

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.589
It’s cold or hot.

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:27.810
The climate is whimsical, agreed.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:36.440
Very whimsical, if you are going out, say,
we were living in Oxsted, 25 miles away, and

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:44.769
when I started from there it was, surprisingly,
it was absolutely clear sky.

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:54.089
And by the time I reached Victoria station,
it was pouring cats and dogs as you say.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.870
Horrible, I couldn’t understand.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.730
Or vice versa.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:08.680
So the climate is whimsical, but that makes
you prepared for every kind of climate, every

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.060
kind of incident.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.430
And you understand, that that is what is the
nature.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:24.680
We shouldn’t fight with the nature, but
we shouldn’t expect everything to be absolutely

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.850
first class when we are going out.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:37.779
So this kind of taking risk has made you people
very courageous, I must say.

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:38.779
Courageous.

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:43.649
And this courage is to be used now in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:47.760
You have to use this for spreading Sahaja
Yoga.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.102
This is your mission.

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.290
This is what you’ll enjoy.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.839
You’ll be amazed, the more you spread, the
higher you’ll go.

00:12:55.839 --> 00:13:03.730
You’ll develop much more, much more powers
within you, and unlimited powers.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:12.660
As far as miracles are concerned, I’m just
- don’t know how to explain them.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.760
Such miracles take place.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:24.330
We had a lady from America, she was staying
with us and she had some sort of a funny disease,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:31.820
that all her intestines and stomach were all
entangled with some sort of a growth.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.970
And she had it before also.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.980
So she had an operation and they took out
everything.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.750
Again she came to Cabella, and she was staying
there.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.960
Again she developed the same problems, the
same symptoms.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.570
She was quite worried.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.300
So they said, “All right, we’ll take you
to the hospital.”

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:56.040
She said, “No, let me first meditate,”
and with meditation, you’ll be amazed, when

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.170
she went to the hospital, the doctor said
“There is nothing, you’re absolutely clear.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.190
You are cleared out.”

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.860
This meditation can help you in so many ways.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:16.450
It’s not a meditation of some sort of a
chanting, or some sort of a going into, as

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:21.190
they said you’ll fly in the air or all those
things, no.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:27.290
It just is meditation by which you enter within
yourself.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.860
Your Kundalini works out with this meditation.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.670
She looks after your illness, she looks after
about your curing.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.959
All kinds of things she looks after.

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:44.560
Even the traffic you know, you’ll be surprised,
it works in so many ways.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:53.060
It is so miraculous, you will find all the
time as if you are helped by some people,

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.370
some angels are there who are helping you.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.390
You’ll be amazed at yourself, when it starts
working out.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:07.100
So, instead of doubting, you keep watching
what’s happening, how it works out.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:13.660
So many things work out in such a beautiful
manner, that you are amazed, as if you have

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.560
entered into the kingdom of God.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.730
Which you have.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:25.130
All the possible help, all the possible solutions,
just come like that.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:32.269
I’ve seen one fellow who had some case on
him, and he told Me, “Mother, I have this

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:35.370
case, and this and that.”

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.240
I said, “All right, you meditate,” and
when he went to the court, they said that

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.699
you’re already solved, that thing is solved
already.

00:15:42.699 --> 00:15:46.500
He was amazed, “How is it solved?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.160
I never even went to the court.”

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:56.840
Then he went to the lawyer, and the lawyer
said, “Yes, they have solved, but I don’t

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.720
know how, because I didn’t go to the court.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.770
I was sitting with Mataji, I didn’t go to
the court.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:09.519
But your problem is solved, because when I
went to the court next day, they said it’s

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.519
all done.”

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:13.279
“But who was arguing the case?”

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.699
“They said you.”

00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:15.699
“I?

00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:19.730
I was not arguing, so who was arguing the
case?”

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:26.660
“There was, and even you see, the remark
of the magistrate is this, that you argued

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.709
very well.”

00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:33.870
It’s a fact, I’m not telling you stories,
it’s a fact, it happened.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.019
He said, “Mother, did you go to argue the
case?”

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:50.430
I said, “I am very bad at that, I do not
know how to argue.”

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:55.649
But such wonderful things have happened, I
mean, you won’t believe, unbelievable things

00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:56.649
happen.

00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:59.399
And, it is just to be seen.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:04.400
As I told you yesterday, you have to be in
the witness state.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:11.309
Don’t you think that there’s anything
less or more with anybody.

00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:14.220
You are all there and are looked after.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.980
But have faith in yourself is the main point.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.549
If you don’t have faith in yourself, it
doesn’t work.

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:21.760
Just have faith in yourself.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.880
I’m not telling you just tall stories, I
tell you.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.270
It is the fact, I Myself I’m amazed how
things work out.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:36.150
I’ll tell you about Dr Spiro, one day what
happened, interesting.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:44.780
You see, I had told the boys not to go in
the sun - in Indian sun, you know?- after

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.250
10 o’clock.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:52.140
But they wanted, I don’t know, to burn their
skin or whatever they wanted to do.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:18:02.049
Five, six boys were there, and when they came
away, they had all blisters all over in their

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:03.049
hands.

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:11.720
So he said, they have to be given tetanus,
that has to be done and all that.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720
I said, “Don’t worry, it can be solved.”

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:26.230
I just took some water and a little cotton
wool and put it on them.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:32.710
And I was, as I was taking it down, it all
disappeared, it was all disappearing.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:39.000
But I told them, that in the evening, go and
sit in the sea so your heat is taken out.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.809
I think they didn’t do it.

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:44.370
I sent them My saris to cover themselves.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:50.059
I said, “Take these saris, cover yourselves,
sleep with them.”

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:54.120
After that, I went to My brother’s place
in Aurangabad.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.660
He was the judge of the high court there.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:06.650
I went there and My brother came and he said,
“What has happened to Your saris?”

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.730
I said, “Why?”

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.520
“See how many big, big holes there are.”

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.669
And I said “How do you know?”

00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:16.580
He said, “These girls went to take out Your
sari for Your bath and there are big, big

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.880
holes all over.”

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.820
All the saris had those holes.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.380
So he said, “How will You manage?”

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.039
I said, “I’ll manage with one sari, it
doesn’t matter.”

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:30.090
But, I just remember these boys, the amount
of heat they had.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.910
They burnt the saris so badly.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.970
But they were not aware of their heat, that
was inside.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.980
Though they were cured, the heat was inside.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:46.950
Like this, there are many, many things that
have happened, and I don’t know how to explain

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.600
to you all these miracles.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:58.160
Now, why do these miracles are there?

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.920
Why there is these miraculous photographs?

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.190
You must have seen them.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.299
To convince people.

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:07.750
They were never convinced you see.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.000
Christ came, He crucified Himself.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.450
Nobody was convinced that He was divine.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:25.880
The problem is, human mind is so stuck up
that they cannot accept anybody as divine.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.240
And at this time, in modern times, when there
are so many false gurus, all kinds of things

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:39.400
going on, I think it was necessary for them
to produce these miraculous photographs.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.820
Actually, I don’t do anything, to be very
frank, I don’t do.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.960
It’s all done by this all-pervading Power.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:59.370
I was once in Brisbane in Australia and I
was sleeping, daytime, so one girl saw a beautiful

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:04.210
rainbow and she wanted to take a picture.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:11.270
She took a picture of the rainbow, but can
you imagine a painting I love very much of

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:16.340
Raphael, of the Mother and the Child, I like
it very much.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.190
And she sees that thing on the photograph.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:30.190
And the circular light that Raphaello has
shown was on top of Her head.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.799
I thought Raphaello himself has painted or
what has happened?

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:36.700
I couldn’t believe Myself.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:43.720
Like this, so many things, so many things,
you can see one by one, some are they have

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.710
collected, some are not.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:53.590
Recently we had a program in Bombay where
we get at least 2 lakhs of people, that means

00:21:53.590 --> 00:22:07.330
200 000 people and they were all preparing,
arranging the stage, and in the photograph,

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.210
I’m already there.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.610
And with Me is Ganesha sitting.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:19.390
Even Shri Ganesha’s actual body, actual
face was there in one of the other pictures.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:24.309
I myself start wondering what is all going
on.

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:30.070
This is the work of Paramachaitanya, which
is trying to convince people who cannot be

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.140
easily convinced.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:38.140
It’s trying to make people understand that
this is divine, this is Divinity.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.169
They never believed in Christ, they never
believed in anyone.

00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:49.350
All kinds of things they have said about Christ,
all sorts of things they have tried to talk

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.940
about Krishna, Rama.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.929
But, still there are very few people who really
believe in them.

00:22:54.929 --> 00:22:58.669
They think it’s a myth.

00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:02.090
But all these myths become real.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:10.900
You’ll be amazed how you will change.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:16.880
You’ll start looking so much younger first
of all.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.802
Myself, you know, I’m very good at recognizing
people, but some people I could not recognize.

00:23:21.802 --> 00:23:24.840
I said “Are you the same?”

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840
“Yes.”

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.270
So transformed, the whole face changes, looking
so much different.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:36.210
One fellow was bald, he’s got all the hair
on his head.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.870
And what did he do?

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.539
He said, “No, Mother, I just raised my Kundalini,
that’s all.”

00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:42.870
“You didn’t do anything?”

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.870
“No, no, I didn’t do anything.”

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:51.539
And he had become so bald, so much bald headed,
that in the passport, his photograph was there,

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:57.510
and when the passport fellow saw him he said,
“You?”

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:04.740
Because he was bald-headed at that time, but
he had hair before, but now, his hair has

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.890
come back.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.550
Unbelievable things have happened.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.110
Unbelievable.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.660
And all this is for you.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.860
You’re in for it.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.529
You can have many, many miracles.

00:24:19.529 --> 00:24:29.011
My, another name is also Daisy, because My
mother was very fond of a teacher, her name

00:24:29.011 --> 00:24:33.020
was Daisy, apart from this, she gave Me the
name of Daisy.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:39.110
Now, when I came to England, I found daisies
everywhere, but they had no fragrance, no

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.110
fragrance.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:45.350
We don’t get daisies in India, you will
be surprised.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.240
But then, they got fragrance.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.230
All daisies got fragrance, very surprising.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:25:00.520
They never had fragrance and they started
smelling very well, in a very beautiful manner.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.890
So it works also in the nature somehow.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:09.210
I mean, that nature should know My name is
Daisy, that this - it’s remarkable.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.720
There’s no end to it.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:21.090
So many angels and so many divine vibrations
are working it out.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:26.820
So I have to first tell you that you must
have faith in yourself, very important, and

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.820
you must meditate.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:33.230
Once you start meditating, you’ll become
masters of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:41.070
For this, color is no bar, religion no bar,
race no bar, nothing.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:51.320
As long as you are a human being and you have
got your realization, you can really go very

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.480
far.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.150
So many miracles have happened to Sahaja Yogis,
so many miracles.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:03.850
And I was surprised, even when they write
to Me, they say Mother, nobody will believe,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.730
but this is what has happened to us.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:12.080
So, I would request you to have faith in yourself
and do meditation.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.220
Very important.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.650
Then the growth within, you’ll be amazed.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:24.430
I have seen people who never wrote any single
line are great poets.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:30.750
Those who could not stand on the dais to speak
have become great orators.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:34.090
So many people have achieved so much.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:41.160
But I just told them, don’t talk about it,
if you talk about it they’ll think we are

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.990
telling some sort of a story.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.990
It’s a fact.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:51.830
Now you also find out in your own life, the
experience of all these changes that take

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:52.830
place.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.850
How the relationships change.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:27:00.309
There was one fellow in America, very rich
man, and he told Me, “I don’t know what

00:27:00.309 --> 00:27:01.350
You did to me.”

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.840
I said, “What happened?”

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:08.730
“See, I hated my cousin, I really hated
him, but the other day I saw him and I felt

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.730
like hugging him.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.730
And I kissed him so he started looking at
me, what’s gone wrong with me?”

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:11.730
You see, like, you change so enjoy now, you
enjoy the collectivity.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.730
Now in India we have a seminar of Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:13.730
You see we have people from all over the world.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.380
We have from Brazil, from Argentina, say from
England, also Spain, everywhere.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.620
Russia, such a lot from Russia.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.640
And when they meet, I’ve never heard anybody
quarrelling or hitting or anything.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.320
They are in thousands, last time we had ten
thousand, but I’ve never seen anybody - but

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.790
such understanding and love.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:32.590
Of course, they pull each other’s legs,
that’s true, as friends, but on the whole

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:37.660
there’s never a fight, never a quarrel.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.679
Can you imagine if this thing happened to
the whole world?

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:49.990
All these wars that they have started, all
this kind of problems they have created in

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:57.749
the name of God, in the name of land, or whatever
it is, will be finished.

00:27:57.749 --> 00:28:04.520
This should happen, this should happen to
the whole world, and I want this world to

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.980
be a very happy and a beautiful place.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.060
And I’m sure you all can achieve it.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.850
Because of you, the vibrations will spread.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:23.330
Vibrations of love, vibrations of compassion.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:31.020
We have also a great idea of having compassion
for the people who are suffering.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.470
So I’ve started a hospital which is very
successful, and we don’t have to charge

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:40.730
anything except for what they have to pay
for their food and stay.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.750
And it’s working wonders.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.669
What has happened?

00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:48.650
What has happened, how is it working like
that?

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.530
It is nothing but sheer divine power.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:29:01.029
We have another hospital now we are starting
in Delhi, and also destitute women, and it’s

00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:04.049
surprising how things work out.

00:29:04.049 --> 00:29:07.740
There was a lady who came and complained about
her husband.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.820
That he has been very unkind to her and this
and that.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.950
I said “All right, once we have destitute
women’s home you come there.”

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:22.260
Amazing, the husband came next day and she
tells Me, “Mother, he’s became a very

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.340
nice man now.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.480
He’s become very nice.”

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480
“Really?”

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:35.190
He didn’t come to meditation, he didn’t
get his realization, how has he become so

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.190
nice?

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.960
How suddenly he has become so nice to his
wife?

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.279
It’s really unbelievable how it acts.

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:46.809
I tell you, we don’t know, this all-pervading
power is the power of love.

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:53.810
God is Truth, but Truth is Love.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:30:01.870
Love not biased, love not because there is
some sort of a gain or some relationship,

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.490
but love which is just love.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:09.370
The ocean of love, and you’ll just start
enjoying that ocean.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:14.870
I have seen it Myself happening and you also
should see.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:19.779
Whenever is possible please come to Cabella
at least, is in Italy.

00:30:19.779 --> 00:30:21.700
There you can see.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:27.980
And we have nothing but a hangar, and they
didn’t want Me to build anything for them.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.970
I said in the hangar how do you live?

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:39.950
“That’s the best Mother, we want to live
in the camp.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:45.880
We don’t want to live in rooms.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.510
We have had enough of it.”

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.070
Imagine, Russians, Americans, all of them
in such beautiful enjoyment.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.200
I tell you, we have to enjoy life.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.510
God has not created us to weep and cry, but
to enjoy.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:05.740
It’s good for you, it’s good for your
children, good for your family, good for your

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.820
nation and for the whole world.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:16.870
As I told you that you are important because
from England everything circulates, circulates,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:17.870
circulates.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:23.809
So, how important you are in Sahaja Yoga I’m
just trying to tell you.

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:27.580
Very important and you can do a lot.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.809
One person went to Russia and now we have
thousands of Russian Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:32.809 --> 00:31:41.240
Thousands of them, they are so dedicated,
so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:50.630
Once I was in Moscow when this coup took place
and big problem was there.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:56.610
So I asked the Sahaja Yogis, “Aren’t you
worried about this coup that has taken place?”

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:57.610
“Which coup, Mother?”

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:04.070
I said, “Which you had in Moscow.“ “Mother,
we don’t live in Moscow, we live in the

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.799
Kingdom of God.”

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:11.190
Just imagine.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:20.360
So when you face reality you are enamored,
you are just filled with joy, because reality

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.700
is joy.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.779
Today’s function, I have never attended
before like this.

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:31.380
But they said “Mother, You should come”
so I’ve tried to make it, but I would like

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.110
you to ask Me questions now.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:37.769
It’s very important, if you have any doubts,
please ask, or if you have anything to say,

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:39.480
please ask.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.200
Thank you.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.919
No questions?

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:46.809
Q. Shri Mataji, what do you think of Buddhism?

00:32:46.809 --> 00:32:51.730
A. Now see, Buddhism is very different from
Buddha.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:52.730
Absolutely.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.480
Buddha first got his realization.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.299
First he became a Buddha and then he started
Buddha religion.

00:33:02.299 --> 00:33:06.350
But the way people are doing Buddhism is the
other way round.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:14.240
That you give up your wife, you give up your
children, you give up even your dress, everything.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.790
To whom? To these people.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:22.720
Buddha started after his realization.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:31.570
After your realization only you can become
Buddha, means a realized soul.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.840
And he said it the same way.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:44.110
He said Buddham Sharanam Gachami, I surrender
myself to other realized souls, Buddham Sharanam

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.160
Gachami.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:53.700
Then he said Sangham Sharanam Gachami, Dharmam
Sharanam Gachami, I surrender myself to the

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:59.909
religion which is within me, innate religion.

00:33:59.909 --> 00:34:13.180
And thirdly he says, Sangham Sharanam Gachami,
I surrender myself to the collective.

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:22.880
This nonsense of giving up this, giving up
that, I mean, it’s too much.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.840
If you are holding onto something then you
can give up.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:33.040
If you are not holding onto anything then
what are you going to give up?

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.980
Simple thing like that, for example, in Canada,
one fellow came wearing that Buddhist’s

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:35.980
dress.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.080
I don’t like it.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:47.790
A Sahaja Yogi said “You’d better go and
change, Mother will not give you realization

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:52.109
if you are wearing this dress.”

00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:58.840
So he came to Me and, “Mother, please forgive
me, I have no other dress left.”

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840
I said, “Why?”

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.840
“I have lost everything.”

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840
He was a big business man.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:07.010
“I’ve lost everything, I’ve given away
to the Buddhists and I’m left with two pair

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:17.760
of these clothes and if you don’t give me
realization, what will I do?”

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760
“Really?”

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.760
“Yes.”

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.220
So, what is there to give up is the point,
what is there to give up?

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.220
If you are not holding onto anything what
are you going to give up?

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.450
Simple thing like that.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:33.359
Buddha never gave up his clothes, nothing
of the kind.

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:36.210
But he wanted to find out, what is the truth.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:42.750
So he went round, I mean he tried his level
best and everything, ultimately his Kundalini

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.380
rose and he got the realization.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:52.550
But what he was doing there, he was just lying
down under a banyan tree.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:58.861
Now, whatever mistakes he has committed, we
need not do, that you give up your wife, you

00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:00.030
give up your child, give up this, give up
that.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:08.390
Just the
contrast of what really Buddha achieved, is

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:14.690
the contrast of that.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:29.720
So Buddhism is not Buddha by any chance.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:37.930
Q. The gentleman wants to know what happens
after we die, Mother?

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.840
A. Now, that’s another point.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.490
Everybody worried about what will happen if
we die.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:52.420
I would say that, as a Sahaja Yogi, you should
not worry about the future because it doesn’t

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.420
exist.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.220
You shouldn’t worry about your past because
it’s finished.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.070
You should be in the presence which is the
reality.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.710
Present is the reality.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:07.130
What’s the use if I tell you what will happen,
you’ll become a bird or anything, are you

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.190
going to believe Me?

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:15.250
You shouldn’t.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:31.290
Q. Could you tell us about angels Shri Mataji?

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:43.460
A. They are very beautiful, just like flowers,
very fragrant.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:51.220
And they will help you; you’ll be amazed
how they’ll help you.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.750
You won’t see them, you don’t see them.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:38:08.980
But they are there, in the form of some human
being - in so many ways.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:13.720
So you cannot describe them because you can’t
see them.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:22.180
But you’ll see their help, and you’ll
be amazed how they guide you to the right

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.180
path.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.320
Now, supposing you lose your way somewhere,
don’t get frustrated, don’t get upset

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.730
about it.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:34.090
If you have lost your way it must be some
purpose.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:40.050
On that way when you go you’ll find somebody
whom you have been looking for ages, or maybe

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.070
some sort of a thing you’ll find, some treasure
you’ll find.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:47.420
So, if you have lost your way, there’s nothing
to worry.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:53.360
They work very smoothly and sweetly.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:39:09.470
Q. She’s asking how you begin to meditate,
Shri Mataji.

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:13.800
A. That of course they will tell you.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.040
There’s a photograph of Mine, first you
have to work on that.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:25.150
Afterwards you will know that how it works,
but first you have to use My photograph, I

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.150
don’t know what to do because the photograph
has the vibrations.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:35.410
You can test it, you’ll get tremendous vibrations
from the photograph.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:41.130
It’s a kind, as we can call, a figure, which
emits vibrations.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.350
I do not gain anything by that, but you will
gain.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:50.530
You will gain, so you have to sit down and
meditate before the photograph.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.530
It’s full of vibrations.

00:39:54.530 --> 00:40:03.060
It’s so effective I tell you, that when
you put these photographs of Mine all over

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:12.670
London, it works.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:25.070
Q. Is prayer the same as meditation?

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:32.970
A. See, before you are connected to the Divine,
what is your prayer?

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.210
It’s nothing.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.270
If you telephone without the connection, what
is it?

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.650
So after realization, the prayer very much
helps.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:52.750
But meditation is inner, prayer is outside.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.420
For your inner growth, meditation is necessary.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:02.670
You don’t have to spend too much time, say
about in the evening before sleeping, if you

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:14.890
can do it for about say ten minutes, or maybe
five minutes in the morning, that’s very

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:16.910
good.

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:38.940
Q. Sahaja Yoga is available to everybody,
is it even available to politicians, Mother?

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:52.400
A. I mean, you know, you’ll be surprised,
in India so many politicians have come to

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.530
Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:54.660
In India.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.619
But I don’t know about English politicians.

00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:09.010
I have met some, but they are so much involved
into their own positions and things.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:23.119
So far none of them, but if you can grab some
people it’s a good idea.

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:42.700
Q. The gentleman asks for your personal blessing
Shri Mataji, he wants your personal blessing.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:48.400
A. May God bless you, may God bless you.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.690
It is for everyone.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:56.990
It’s for everyone.

00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:03.680
Q. What is the difference between the soul
and the spirit.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.680
A.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.190
The soul and the spirit?

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:14.680
It’s a subject should be dealt later on
but little in short I’ll tell you.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:24.850
The soul is the essence, essence of the five
elements.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:25.890
Essence.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:38.150
For example, for Mother Earth, the essence
is fragrance, so all these five elements have

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:45.010
essence, and this essence contains the soul
in the sense that the soul is the reflection

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:49.700
of God Almighty within us.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:44:00.640
So the body is that of the five elements,
the essence of the five elements and the spirit

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:17.660
is the one which is reflected on it, that
is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:29.530
But later on you’ll know much more.

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:40.210
Q. Mother he wants to know if You still meditate
Yourself?

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.513
A. I am in meditation all the time.

00:44:42.513 --> 00:45:33.520
(A gentleman starts to speak for a very long
time, Shri Mataji says “It’s a big lecture.”)

00:45:33.520 --> 00:46:03.329
Q. He wants to know, there are different meditations
he says, and he’s confused, Mother.

00:46:03.329 --> 00:46:19.970
A. Meditation cannot be different, it has
to be one, and the one that makes you deep

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.490
is the meditation.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:30.840
All kinds of meditation, there was one meditation
they had started here by which you will start

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.720
moving three feet higher than normal.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:41.790
Now think of it, already we have traffic jams.

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:49.030
You can find the stupidity in all of them.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:55.700
If you use your intelligence, you’ll find
out, because you don’t grow.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.540
Meditation that is good is the one by which
you grow.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.800
Everything is not the food.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:21.680
The food that you can eat is the food.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:31.570
Q. What do you think about Islam Mother?

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:36.510
A. Islam is great, no doubt.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.080
But nobody follows Islam.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.550
Nobody follows, nobody has read even Koran.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:41.690
You’ll be amazed.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:46.640
They are fighting without understanding what
Islam has written.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:55.690
Mohammed Sahib was one of the incarnations
of the real Gurus, but Muslims, stupid as

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.670
they are, they don’t follow.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.849
They don’t follow the exact sayings of Koran.

00:48:00.849 --> 00:48:10.099
Now in Koran is written, that at the time
of resurrection your hands will speak.

00:48:10.099 --> 00:48:11.099
See?

00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:16.550
And without that you cannot be Muslim, I mean
Muslim means surrendered.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:22.101
Just imagine, it’s all Sahaja Yoga, if you
can read between the lines.

00:48:22.101 --> 00:48:37.030
We have a book called as “Koran Enlightened,”
we have also “Bible Enlightened,” we have

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:43.790
“Gita Enlightened.”

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:50.559
All right?

00:48:50.559 --> 00:49:11.830
Q. He says he finds it difficult to meditate
because his mind is wandering.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.070
How to control the mind Mother?

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.680
A. Never control.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:22.070
Don’t try to control it.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:24.670
There’s no need to control.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:32.960
Your Kundalini itself will give you thoughtless
awareness, She’ll work it out.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:44.490
Try on the photograph, it will work out.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:50:00.400
Q. It’s a request Mother, will you come
to Ireland one day?

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:06.540
A. Oh, of course!

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:15.760
They are lost, fighting among themselves.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.220
But I have a special feeling for Ireland.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:23.371
Because of ignorance, complete ignorance,
now the Catholics were fighting Protestants,

00:50:23.371 --> 00:50:31.369
now Protestants are fighting each other, now
Catholics will start fighting each other.

00:50:31.369 --> 00:50:40.180
I don’t want to say anything, but you must
understand that all these religions have created

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:47.440
nothing but fighting mongerers.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.849
Crucified Christ and how can you think of
fighting?

00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:56.340
All over the world there’s fight in the
name of God.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:02.940
Can you imagine the stupidity?

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:17.089
Irish are very nice people, very simple, but
they get lost into these different, different

00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:18.470
ideas.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:29.550
Actually, religion should never make you fight,
but the religions have misled them, the religions

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:32.250
have misled them, all right?

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:37.170
We have to give them that real religion of
within.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.970
Innate religion.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:50.990
In Italy they started an argument with Me
and they said, “We don’t” - ultimately,

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:54.810
they said, “We don’t want to have one
religion for the whole world.”

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:55.810
I said, “Why?

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:59.369
Because then you can’t fight, isn’t it?”

00:51:59.369 --> 00:52:05.450
You want to have many religions so you can
nicely fight with each other.

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:11.020
Like Rwanda and all these people.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:17.770
Religion must bring peace, joy, otherwise
what’s the use of having any religion?

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:26.390
Q. Will you one day come to Scotland, Mother?

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:30.589
A. Scotland I have been.

00:52:30.589 --> 00:53:04.530
I have been to Scotland, but, the problem
was, at about 12 o’clock everybody was drunk.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:23.300
Q. Can Sahaja Yoga change your fate, change
your karma, change your destiny?

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.730
Can Sahaja Yoga change it?

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:28.069
A. Your karmas are finished.

00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:31.349
After Sahaja Yoga, your karmas are finished.

00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:39.349
And can change your face also, but why do
you want to change your face?

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:41.849
- Fate, fate!!

00:53:41.849 --> 00:53:49.359
I thought she wanted to change….

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:53.740
Ah, of course, of course it can.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:54:05.880
It can change your fate and all your aspirations
are changed.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:18.720
Then you just want to spread Sahaja Yoga,
and enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:34.513
Q. He is a student Mother, how can Sahaja
Yoga help with being a student, with education?

00:54:34.513 --> 00:54:35.513
A. Very much.

00:54:35.513 --> 00:54:39.530
For student, it’s a blessing I say.

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:45.720
Do you know, Sahaja Yogis who have been very
bad students, have stood first, have got first

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:53.890
class, first all over the world Sahaja Yogis
are doing so well in their studies because

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.010
you get a clear cut vision.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:56.200
It’s tremendous, for students it’s very
good.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:03.780
Q. Is it important to be a vegetarian Mother?

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:13.100
A. Not at all.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:22.549
You see, in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat animals
which are bigger than us and you need not

00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:28.490
eat animals in case you are a person who requires
more vegetables.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:32.670
So it depends on your constitution.

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:39.180
Now supposing a person who is vegetarian and
gets diarrhea, he should stop.

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:54.849
I’m not a vegetarian.

00:55:54.849 --> 00:56:12.670
Q. He’s got a problem with his knees.

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:15.750
A. Can be cured.

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:16.750
Knee problems can be cured.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:23.230
And how and when, that’s what, you have
to see these people and they will tell you

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.290
how to cure it.

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:29.349
It can be cured.

00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:45.470
It is related to your chakras.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:57:05.319
Q. She says You travel a lot, do You fall
sick?

00:57:05.319 --> 00:57:11.809
You travel all over the world, to different
climates, do You fall sick?

00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:13.859
A. No, no.

00:57:13.859 --> 00:57:18.849
You see, people while they are traveling,
they think they are traveling, that’s why

00:57:18.849 --> 00:57:19.849
they get sick.

00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:21.720
I never think.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:39.250
I think I’m sitting nicely on a coach and
also they think that, when will they reach,

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:57.329
will there be people or not, worried about
that, or maybe their past things they are

00:57:57.329 --> 00:58:00.960
worried.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.339
I am not.

00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:05.080
I don’t get sick.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:12.080
Q. Another request, Shri Mataji, when will
you go to South Africa?

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.080
A.

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:19.020
You know the problem was like this, that on
My passport it was written that Indians cannot.

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:24.130
Because I am a diplomat, diplomatic thing,
we cannot go to South Africa.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:33.549
Now they have removed, so after that I will
try to.

00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:46.109
Q. He says, Shri Mataji, that he lives in
South Africa and You are very far away physically,

00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:51.740
but he feels that You are there, helping him,
why is that?

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.670
A. That’s My attention.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.550
I really want to go to South Africa.

00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:02.460
I’ve been trying, but I haven’t got the
permission.

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.640
And now I’ve got the permission, definitely
I’ll go.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:14.609
And when you don’t have permission you are
more concerned about that country, isn’t

00:59:14.609 --> 00:59:17.900
it?

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:26.940
Q. What do you think about entities, bad spirits
Mother, earth-bound spirits?

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:30.349
A. They are, no doubt.

00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:31.349
They are there.

00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:38.330
But you don’t worry, you don’t have them.

00:59:38.330 --> 01:00:08.171
Q. Is there any similarity that we know of
between Sahaja Yoga and ancient Egyptian or

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.171
African religions?

01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:10.171
A.

01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:14.280
In Africa, I was surprised that they have
talked about Kundalini.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:25.020
They have, and I have seen some of the maps,
old maps, of Africa, they have made the picture

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.230
of Kundalini also, all over.

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:37.040
Even in a place like Bolivia, which is so
far away, and somebody went to Bolivia from

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.530
Italy and he said, “Mother they know everything
about Kundalini.”

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:42.530
I said, “Really?”

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:47.049
“Yes, they know, but they don’t know how
to awaken it.”

01:00:47.049 --> 01:00:56.819
And Sahaja Yoga has spread so much in Bolivia,
the Minister from there came to see Me.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:57.819
And who told them?

01:00:57.819 --> 01:00:58.819
I said, “Who told you?”

01:00:58.819 --> 01:01:02.430
They said, “There were two saints who came
from India.”

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:09.440
Even in Ukraine, I was surprised, they said,
“There were two saints who came here from

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440
India, they told us about Kundalini.”

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:18.760
Chinese people, they believe that there is
a treasure of spirituality in India but they

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.880
don’t know what it is, you see.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.742
But these two I don’t know who they were.

01:01:26.742 --> 01:01:28.430
Two saints known as Machindranath and Goraknath
who have been traveling all over the world.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:37.809
I don’t know if they went all the way over
there.

01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:48.020
Q. A question about Paramahansa Yogananda,
he’s quite famous here because of his book.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.680
A. He’s famous?

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.900
What has he done?

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.130
What has he done?

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:57.090
Writing a funny book like that, that’s all.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:02:03.490
I don’t want to discuss, but first when
you ask about somebody, you’ll have to tell

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:06.490
Me what he has done.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:19.809
Q. The gentleman set up a “Self Realization
Fellowship” in America.

01:02:19.809 --> 01:02:29.349
A. I know many in America who have done it,
and they are more difficult to get Self-realization.

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:35.620
There’s a big organization there, and they
all believe they are Self-realized, but they

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.549
don’t know any vibrations, they can’t
feel anything, and when they have been to

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:47.160
that organization, I find it difficult to
give them realization.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:53.230
In the name of God, in the name of Self-realization
if you spoil the Kundalini of people, I don’t

01:02:53.230 --> 01:03:04.460
know what to say about them.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:30.980
Q. Is it possible to meditate for the benefit
of other people?

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.230
A.

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.309
In meditation you don’t think of anything.

01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:40.099
See, you have to become thoughtless, that
is meditation.

01:03:40.099 --> 01:03:46.089
And for other people, you can always ask,
you are yourself protected, and there are

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:54.070
ways they’ll tell you how to work out for
others.

01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:58.859
See, they’ll tell you later on.

01:03:58.859 --> 01:04:08.430
Q. Shri Mataji, will peace, complete peace,
ever exist on the planet?

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:14.630
A. I wish that, I very much wish that, but
it depends on you people.

01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:15.630
How much you work it out.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:53.059
Q. He wants to know if there is any connection
between the work that You do and the work

01:04:53.059 --> 01:04:56.990
that Sai Baba does?

01:04:56.990 --> 01:05:00.930
A. Which Sai Baba?

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.930
Q.

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:05.839
This modern fellow, Mother.

01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:07.809
A. Well.

01:05:07.809 --> 01:05:12.750
I mean, giving diamonds and this and that.

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:21.920
Shirdi Sai Nath is correct, Shirdi Sai Nath
of course, but not this one.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:27.359
People who want diamonds can go to him, baba
I can’t give diamonds.

01:05:27.359 --> 01:05:40.540
Q. Are there more people becoming Self-realized,
or less people?

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.950
A. Much more.

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:47.320
It’s increasing, much more.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:58.100
I told you I started with one lady and in
England with seven, now look at them.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:08.980
Q. If someone develops astral projection,
by accident Mother, and they feel bad, what

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.070
can they do?

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:16.920
A. They will get rid of it if they become
realized people, because you’re protected.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.609
It’s very dangerous to have that astral
nonsense.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:20.609
Q. The gentleman is interested in Your experience
with Mahatma Gandhi?

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:21.609
A. Mahatma Gandhi was My disciple.

01:06:21.609 --> 01:06:22.609
You’ll be amazed.

01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:25.930
And he told Me, let our country become free,
and in that freedom then you can start your

01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:26.930
Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:32.720
Then we had Lal Bahadur Shastri, who understood
Me and he said, of course, let me come back

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:40.190
from Pakistan, he had gone to Russia for Pakistan
problem.

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:49.220
He never came back.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:07:06.049
Q. He said yesterday Shri Mataji, You said
you may feel cool under the hands, he wants

01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:08.160
to know why, what it is?

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:30.470
A. It is, you should take it up you see, it
has some reasons, but I don’t want to tell

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:32.130
that.

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:45.390
You just take it up there like that.

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:48.289
Q. What do You think about healing?

01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:52.549
There are all different kinds of healing,
what do You think about the healing?

01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:57.010
A. Healing should be done with full understanding
of Kundalini.

01:07:57.010 --> 01:08:02.980
Any other healing can result into something
else.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:09.940
So be careful.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:28.759
Q. Is it true that with Sahaja Yoga your immune
system improves so that you protect yourself

01:08:28.759 --> 01:08:29.759
against disease?

01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:31.110
A. Of course.

01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:37.350
Immune system absolutely gets cured, no doubt,
and many problems of immune system also get

01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:38.350
cured.

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:39.449
But also, you are protected.

01:08:39.449 --> 01:08:51.219
Q. Another request Shri Mataji, when will
You come to Malaysia?

01:08:51.219 --> 01:08:56.069
A. I have been, I have been many a time.

01:08:56.069 --> 01:09:06.710
I have been there, and the Chinese are coming
to Sahaja Yoga, but Indians, I don’t know

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.029
what to say about them.

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:15.040
Q. He’s asking Shri Mataji if you will guide
us into a meditation now?

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:23.239
There are some people here who were not at
the Royal Albert Hall, Mother.

01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:24.239
A. I see.

01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:26.630
But are there any questions left?

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:46.069
Q. He said he has read in a book that it can
be dangerous to awaken to Kundalini, so do

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:47.460
you need a teacher, Mother?

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:51.009
A. That’s very true, there have been people
who wrote like this.

01:09:51.009 --> 01:09:56.340
But those who wrote, just go and see their
lives, what they have been up to.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.490
You see, you have to be a master, otherwise
you can’t do it.

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:05.570
Then it’s not the Kundalini, but a Deity
there, which gets annoyed, and then it happens.

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:11.000
It’s not Kundalini.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.120
Q. What do you think of Ayurveda?

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.100
A. Quite good.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:31.160
Ayurveda is quite good, because it deals with
the three doshas and it’s very near Sahaja

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160
Yoga.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.130
But with Sahaja Yoga you get cured yourself,
so you don’t need anything much.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:11:06.070
Q. He says he’s impressed by the fact that
Sahaja Yoga is free, but he thinks it sounds

01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:11.570
too easy, he doesn’t feel that he’s completely
Self-realized, Mother?

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:21.949
He says he feels the cool breeze, but he thinks
there must be more work to do?

01:11:21.949 --> 01:11:30.389
A. Yes, that’s true but I must say, but
are you an Italian?

01:11:30.389 --> 01:11:32.370
Are you an Italian?

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:33.370
Irish.

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:42.050
Because the way he was speaking I thought
he was Italian you see.

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:49.100
I went to Italy and I didn’t know, we were
told not to use our hands, and in Italy you

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:51.120
see, they will go on like this, like that.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:55.310
And they say something, you don’t know what
they are saying, but their hands are moving

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:56.540
in different, different directions.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.390
So I thought he was Italian.

01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:00.239
All right, what was his question?

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:12.360
He says it sounds too easy, he thinks there
must be more work to do.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:21.810
It is very easy to get realization, but to
settle with it, you have to do meditation,

01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:24.270
and you’ll find out what’s wrong with
you.

01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:29.130
You’ll find out what chakras are catching
on your fingertips, and then try to improve

01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:31.260
that.

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:54.790
Q. Can Sahaja Yoga help with psychiatric problems,
with mental problems?

01:12:54.790 --> 01:13:02.330
A. Of course, of course it can.

01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:10.310
Very much it can help.

01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:27.860
Q. Do you think that the world is a better
place?

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.910
Are things improving?

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:33.300
A. They can.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:39.330
With Sahaja Yoga it will, definitely improve.

01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:48.429
If human beings improve, world will improve
also.

01:13:48.429 --> 01:14:08.430
Q. Shri Mataji, he is Italian and he is using
his hands!

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:15.020
A. Yes, they are very expressive you know
[laughs].

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:23.150
Q. Shri Mataji, his question is, is it possible
to raise your Kundalini when you are a child

01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:24.600
by accident?

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.060
A. No.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.140
There are children who are born realized.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.350
There are children.

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:34.540
And you can raise their Kundalini also, it’s
very much easier to raise the Kundalini of

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.720
children, you can do that.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:42.530
So, it’s not an accident, it is just, it’s
there, they are born like that.

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:48.480
They are special people, many people who are
married in Sahaja Yoga have got very great

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.330
saints born to them.

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:57.800
I have a great grandson who is another realized
soul, you know.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:03.340
So when nobody is there, he will sit before
Me and do like this.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:11.121
(Shri Mataji holds open Her hands) He’s
not even two, but he speaks so much, he can

01:15:11.121 --> 01:15:23.800
count from one to twenty and it’s tremendous.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:37.920
Now, one thing I’ll say, if you ask one
question it should be sufficient, all right.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:44.280
Q. Krishnamurti, Shri Mataji?

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:50.650
A. Loaded with thoughts.

01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:57.330
Another are Krishnamurtis, they can’t get
realization so fast I tell you.

01:15:57.330 --> 01:16:01.030
So much have put in their brain.

01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:03.630
The Kundalini has to cross the brain.

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:22.320
But so much in the limbic area, that’s My
experience.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:36.380
Q. He’s heard on a tape Shri Mataji that
you said that you are always in dreams, in

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.140
a dream state.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.550
A. No, not at all.

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:48.340
I actually don’t get any dreams.

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:53.540
I might have said it’s My dream to see the
world like this.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.260
It’s become a fashion now to say that, isn’t
it?

01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.310
“It’s My dream.”

01:16:58.310 --> 01:17:13.770
Q. How did you come to this Realization Shri
Mataji?

01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:24.350
A. I was born like that.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:31.080
I was born.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:37.170
Q. Why is there a difference, why are we all
not born Self-realized?

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:40.739
Why is it so difficult for people?

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:44.710
A. It depends on your past life.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:57.070
Your desires, if they are unfulfilled, then
you get a life where you are fulfilled.

01:17:57.070 --> 01:18:02.980
Like, I know, I’ll tell you one thing, I
had a driver who was very royal by temperament,

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.989
and he was a royal king you see.

01:18:04.989 --> 01:18:12.370
But he had to work very hard, so he was desiring
he should become like his chariot driver so

01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:14.260
that he’ll have some rest.

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:17.929
So he became a driver.

01:18:17.929 --> 01:18:24.190
Also marriage, and all these things are responsible,
because we should not have any earnest desire,

01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:27.490
then it acts.

01:18:27.490 --> 01:18:52.590
Q. In order to get Self-realization, do you
have to desire it Mother?

01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:59.880
A. Of course.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.250
I cannot force.

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:05.810
I cannot force.

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:11.739
Q. Another question Shri Mataji.

01:19:11.739 --> 01:19:13.270
What do you think about Chinmoy?

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:14.690
A. Ah.

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:26.780
You see, if you ask such questions I don’t
know how to answer because it’s very embarrassing.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:28.700
What has he done?

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.400
That’s the only question you should ask.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:45.090
And moreover, if you have been to all these
it will be difficult for you to get your Self-realization.

01:19:45.090 --> 01:20:14.470
Q. Shri Mataji, is it possible that the Kundalini
can be damaged?

01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:22.120
And what happens if the Kundalini is damaged
already?

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.460
A. I don’t know.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:30.130
So far, I have seen that so many of these
false gurus and false people have damaged

01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:31.400
the Kundalini of people.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:46.659
And I have seen their Kundalini has been like
a snake, you would say, hurt.

01:20:46.659 --> 01:20:49.860
Difficult, but you can mend it.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.760
If the desire is great, you can mend it.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:21:02.870
But I’ve seen that, in some people, the
Kundalini is very much injured.

01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:13.950
Q. Do you have to believe in God Mother?

01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:17.460
A. Not necessarily.

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:26.590
Whether you believe or not, He is there.

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:53.560
Q. Mother, one of Your names is Moksha Pradayini,
what is Moksha, what does it mean?

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.239
A. All these names I’ll explain to you later
on, just now they’ll be all shocked with

01:21:56.239 --> 01:21:57.239
this.

01:21:57.239 --> 01:22:03.650
It means the giver of Self-realization.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:12.070
Q. She’s worried about the subconscious.

01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:50.639
If we are trying to get into balance, how
can we ignore the subconscious?

01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:56.100
A. It settles down by itself.

01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:04.469
You see, the idea of subconscious is not like
Jung.

01:23:04.469 --> 01:23:11.330
Subconscious is on the left hand side.

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:12.760
And supraconscious right side.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.590
The Kundalini is in the center.

01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:23.670
So you don’t have to worry about subconscious
part, it just disappears.

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:42.740
Q. Is it wrong to have desires for other things,
apart from self-realization?

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:48.840
A. No, there’s nothing wrong or right.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.040
You don’t have, you don’t have any desire.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:55.139
You just become so sweet.

01:23:55.139 --> 01:23:59.510
You don’t have any desires as such.

01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:00.510
Wrong and right is not there, it’s just
you don’t have.

01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:06.060
I would say, I have one desire, to now stop
questioning.

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:29.250
It is now about 10 o’clock, and we should
have our, again, the experience of the Self.

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:34.650
So you sit comfortably with your hands towards
Me like that.

01:24:34.650 --> 01:25:01.770
And no more questioning, allow your mind to
rest, allow it.

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:05.720
Now put your hands towards Me please.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.000
Now, close your eyes, please close your eyes.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.712
You can raise your left hand on top of your
fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone

01:25:15.712 --> 01:25:19.710
in your childhood.

01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:38.179
Just stop thinking, just stop thinking, by
saying “Not this, not this, not this.”

01:25:38.179 --> 01:26:04.000
Now, please raise your right hand, and left
hand towards Me.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:30.719
Raise your right hand on top of the fontanel
bone area.

01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:49.750
Now, please open your eyes and see for yourself
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:58.260
through your fingertips, or on your palm,
or out of your fontanel bone area.

01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:15.780
Please, put your both hands towards Me, like
that.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:37.150
All those who have felt, again cool breeze
out of their palm or out of their fingertips,

01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:40.110
or out of the fontanel bone area.

01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:51.890
Or could be hot breeze also, in some people
who have not forgiven themselves and others.

01:27:51.890 --> 01:28:07.760
Please raise your hands, those who have.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.020
Ah.

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:14.560
That’s great.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:37.720
Everyone of you, may God bless you.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:53.850
I bow to you.

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:56.870
I bow to you.

01:28:56.870 --> 01:29:49.780
It’s tremendous, with all these questions
and all that, still, you have achieved it.

01:29:49.780 --> 01:30:28.060
It’s a great achievement.

01:30:28.060 --> 01:32:24.860
May God bless you for the future.

01:32:24.860 --> 01:34:21.670
Would you like to hear one song?

01:34:21.670 --> 01:35:11.730
(musicians sing Powada)

01:35:11.730 --> 01:36:01.790
Now, enjoy yourselves.

01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:18.480
Enjoy.
