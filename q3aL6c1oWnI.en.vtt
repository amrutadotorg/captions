00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:08.490
There has been no never such confusion in the
minds of human beings as it is today,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.776
as to the right or wrong.
Never so much:

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:15.307
whatever&nbsp;was said, "This was not good",  they would do,

00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:17.955
knowingly that they are doing wrong.

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:22.121
If they&nbsp;were good people they would say, "All right, this is good, we'll do the good".

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:27.739
But everybody knew&nbsp;that this was wrong or right.
They may do it.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.448
But today, no one knows what&nbsp;is wrong and what is right.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.180
Apart from wrong and right, it's much beyond that,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.406
you have to know yourself.

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:42.725
Because this awareness is within us that we do not know ourselves.

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:45.969
We do&nbsp;not know the absolute we live in a relative world.

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:48.655
Of this, everybody seems to be conscious.

00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:52.540
Maybe&nbsp;in the subconscious or maybe in the unconscious.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.097
But definitely, there's a feeling in every one&nbsp;of us,

00:00:57.177 --> 00:00:59.694
that we do not know.

00:00:59.774 --> 00:01:02.460
And it's a very honest feeling.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.825
It's a very sublime feeling that we have
to know something more.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:13.410
Now when we say the word 'no' we think as if I would say, "I don't know"

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.158
about Derbyshire, I've never been there.

00:01:16.238 --> 00:01:20.545
Now this means what? "I don’t know about Derbyshire".

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:22.625
What don’t I know about Derbyshire?

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:28.312
I can read it in the books, I can find out. I can know all the history of Derbyshire.

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:32.799
I can find out who were the people who, who were making beautiful porcelain here,

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.320
I can find out all about their history, everything I can read about it.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.886
Still, why should I say I don’t know anything about Derbyshire?

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.366
Because I have not been to Derbyshire before.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.213
I have not been to Derby.

00:01:44.293 --> 00:01:47.341
I have not been&nbsp;to this area I have not seen this place.

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.847
I have not visited it I have had no experience of this place

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.088
so I don't know about it.

00:01:53.168 --> 00:01:56.064
This is exactly what is the situation.

00:01:56.144 --> 00:01:59.949
The situation is that we do not know
about the Divine.

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.200
We have read about it we have heard about it.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.107
So many people have written about
it once they know there's an inquiry about it they come out with books.

00:02:09.187 --> 00:02:12.574
Books after books thousands of
books they have written.

00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:15.959
How many of them are true and how many of them are untrue?

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:19.080
It is impossible&nbsp;to find out.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.860
Because we do not actually know.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.364
Supposing somebody says that Duke of Bedford was born in Derbyshire.

00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:29.678
All right. How will I know?

00:02:29.758 --> 00:02:35.377
I would not know till I meet somebody who is
really belonging to that place, who knows about it.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.032
In the same way, the knowledge that we have also
about Divine

00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:44.665
is very confusing but this is not knowledge.

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:47.055
This is never the knowledge.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:56.586
The idea&nbsp;of knowledge comes to us
as if it is a kind of an answer

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:58.978
to our inquiries which&nbsp;is rational,

00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:03.334
which we can understand&nbsp;intelligently through our intelligence.

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:06.305
But now this area is beyond intelligence,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.437
beyond rationality.

00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:13.706
Beyond all that&nbsp;is limited, is the unlimited area

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.746
All such unlimited areas can be only known by
experience

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.438
of your awareness.

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:26.198
Now this one should&nbsp;&nbsp;understand is a very delicate thing

00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:30.712
how to know&nbsp;something
and experience of our awareness.

00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:33.938
Not an experience they suddenly see a light. So it's an
experience.

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:36.188
I mean you can always see a light.

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:42.208
So great the people feel about it that they have seen
some light suddenly sparking before them.

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:46.430
Nothing so great! There could be some area, from there as sparking can come

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.040
and maybe it is of no use to you,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.722
but just you might feel that you have experienced.

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:56.611
So, one must know that seeing is not experiencing.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.275
For example, a dog sees this instrument [mike].

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.158
But what does he know about it? He sees it.

00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:15.784
Awareness, the human awareness has so many great
things about itself

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:18.974
 compared to the animal&nbsp;awareness.

00:04:19.928 --> 00:04:25.590
For example, we can say the awareness of
beauty, animals don't have.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.776
 Awareness of cleanliness, animals don't have.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.726
 Human beings have these built within themselves.

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:42.206
 They can feel it, they&nbsp;can feel it
on their central nervous system

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.520
So, whatever is your awareness is to
be felt on your central nervous system.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.183
It's not just an imaginary thing or a intellectual
discussion,

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:55.087
"Ah I see, yes, I know". Not that.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:59.165
The knowledge should come&nbsp;to you through your feelings;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.293
like I can feel this is hot or cold.

00:05:04.373 --> 00:05:08.235
But a stone&nbsp;will not feel anything.

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:12.100
In the same way, the feeling has to come through your central nervous system.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.058
That means your awareness itself is to be going, has to be charged.

00:05:17.313 --> 00:05:19.512
It has to get a new dimension.

00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:23.120
Your awareness itself has to get a new dimension.

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:27.165
All other experiences has no meaning
whatsoever in evolution, if you see.

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:33.030
In evolutionary process, it is the awareness that
improves,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.958
receives better and better dimensions.

00:05:37.194 --> 00:05:42.589
And these dimensions have reached its maximum at
the time when you become a human being,

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.663
where your&nbsp;awareness is just ready to receive

00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:53.487
the awareness&nbsp;of the universal Being, of the collective Being,

00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:56.595
so that you become the collective Being.

00:05:56.675 --> 00:05:59.838
Now&nbsp;I would like to tell you about this within&nbsp;ourselves,

00:05:59.918 --> 00:06:01.467
how we are placed.

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:07.773
 For every practical&nbsp;purposes,
you should not take me for granted,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.255
but you should not also deny what I tell you.

00:06:11.335 --> 00:06:15.222
It's like entering into a new University:

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.704
we listen to the professor and we try to
follow him.

00:06:20.784 --> 00:06:28.747
Supposing he propounded, he propounds a hypothesis before you,

00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:34.200
then you just&nbsp;start judging
 it, work it out.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.408
If it is true,

00:06:39.707 --> 00:06:41.696
then you call it a law.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:48.185
In the same way,
we should enter into this new understanding,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.128
by first seeing it, not denying it.

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:55.825
Then if it is true, then we have to believe it.

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:58.798
There should be no blind faith about Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:01.686
Blind faith does not help at all.

00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:04.669
Neither there should be a denial.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.574
And with that cheerful attitude, if you just listen to Me as a hypothesis, whatever I'm telling you,

00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:13.549
you need not accept it as truth just now.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.540
But then the time has come for me
to prove the truth to you.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.071
And the truth can be proved to you.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.233
Time has come to prove the existence of God;

00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:28.273
to prove, not prove that

00:07:28.463 --> 00:07:32.331
I give you a big lecture or take you to course
or some sort of a thing like that.

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:36.405
But how&nbsp;am I going to prove it? On your awareness!

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:45.077
It is going to be absolute experience of your awareness

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:50.180
that&nbsp;you are going to feel God almighty.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.335
Time has come to prove the scriptures,

00:07:55.415 --> 00:07:57.516
all the scriptures.

00:07:58.387 --> 00:08:04.370
The time has come to prove your own connection with God,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.999
your own relationship with him,

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:10.576
your own relationship with that Primordial Being,

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:15.033
whether you call it God or anything
I it makes no difference to God himself.

00:08:15.113 --> 00:08:18.525
Whether you call him by any name there
is God.

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:21.846
And that God is not the way you conceive God.

00:08:21.926 --> 00:08:25.793
It's not the way you understand&nbsp;God or you know God.

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:28.386
But it's the God as he is.
