00:03.433 --> 00:08.490
There has been no never such confusion in the
minds of human beings as it is today,

00:08.690 --> 00:11.776
as to the right or wrong.
Never so much:

00:11.856 --> 00:15.307
whatever\hwas said, "This was not good",  they would do,

00:15.813 --> 00:17.955
knowingly that they are doing wrong.

00:18.036 --> 00:22.121
If they\hwere good people they would say, "All right, this is good, we'll do the good".

00:22.202 --> 00:27.739
But everybody knew\hthat this was wrong or right.
They may do it.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.448
But today, no one knows what\his wrong and what is right.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.180
Apart from wrong and right, it's much beyond that,

00:36.260 --> 00:38.406
you have to know yourself.

00:38.486 --> 00:42.725
Because this awareness is within us that we do not know ourselves.

00:42.805 --> 00:45.969
We do\hnot know the absolute we live in a relative world.

00:46.049 --> 00:48.655
Of this, everybody seems to be conscious.

00:48.735 --> 00:52.540
Maybe\hin the subconscious or maybe in the unconscious.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.097
But definitely, there's a feeling in every one\hof us,

00:57.177 --> 00:59.694
that we do not know.

00:59.774 --> 01:02.460
And it's a very honest feeling.

01:02.540 --> 01:07.825
It's a very sublime feeling that we have
to know something more.

01:07.934 --> 01:13.410
Now when we say the word 'no' we think as if I would say, "I don't know"

01:13.490 --> 01:16.158
about Derbyshire, I've never been there.

01:16.238 --> 01:20.545
Now this means what? "I don’t know about Derbyshire".

01:20.625 --> 01:22.625
What don’t I know about Derbyshire?

01:22.784 --> 01:28.312
I can read it in the books, I can find out. I can know all the history of Derbyshire.

01:28.392 --> 01:32.799
I can find out who were the people who, who were making beautiful porcelain here,

01:32.879 --> 01:36.320
I can find out all about their history, everything I can read about it.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.886
Still, why should I say I don’t know anything about Derbyshire?

01:39.966 --> 01:42.366
Because I have not been to Derbyshire before.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.213
I have not been to Derby.

01:44.293 --> 01:47.341
I have not been\hto this area I have not seen this place.

01:47.421 --> 01:50.847
I have not visited it I have had no experience of this place

01:50.927 --> 01:53.088
so I don't know about it.

01:53.168 --> 01:56.064
This is exactly what is the situation.

01:56.144 --> 01:59.949
The situation is that we do not know
about the Divine.

02:00.029 --> 02:03.200
We have read about it we have heard about it.

02:03.280 --> 02:09.107
So many people have written about
it once they know there's an inquiry about it they come out with books.

02:09.187 --> 02:12.574
Books after books thousands of
books they have written.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.959
How many of them are true and how many of them are untrue?

02:16.068 --> 02:19.080
It is impossible\hto find out.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.860
Because we do not actually know.

02:21.940 --> 02:27.364
Supposing somebody says that Duke of Bedford was born in Derbyshire.

02:27.444 --> 02:29.678
All right. How will I know?

02:29.758 --> 02:35.377
I would not know till I meet somebody who is
really belonging to that place, who knows about it.

02:36.140 --> 02:41.032
In the same way, the knowledge that we have also
about Divine

02:41.112 --> 02:44.665
is very confusing but this is not knowledge.

02:44.745 --> 02:47.055
This is never the knowledge.

02:47.135 --> 02:56.586
The idea\hof knowledge comes to us
as if it is a kind of an answer

02:56.666 --> 02:58.978
to our inquiries which\his rational,

02:59.058 --> 03:03.334
which we can understand\hintelligently through our intelligence.

03:03.414 --> 03:06.305
But now this area is beyond intelligence,

03:06.440 --> 03:08.437
beyond rationality.

03:08.618 --> 03:13.706
Beyond all that\his limited, is the unlimited area

03:14.300 --> 03:20.746
All such unlimited areas can be only known by
experience

03:20.826 --> 03:22.438
of your awareness.

03:22.622 --> 03:26.198
Now this one should\h\hunderstand is a very delicate thing

03:26.278 --> 03:30.712
how to know\hsomething
and experience of our awareness.

03:30.868 --> 03:33.938
Not an experience they suddenly see a light. So it's an
experience.

03:34.018 --> 03:36.188
I mean you can always see a light.

03:36.268 --> 03:42.208
So great the people feel about it that they have seen
some light suddenly sparking before them.

03:42.288 --> 03:46.430
Nothing so great! There could be some area, from there as sparking can come

03:46.510 --> 03:50.040
and maybe it is of no use to you,

03:50.120 --> 03:52.722
but just you might feel that you have experienced.

03:52.802 --> 03:56.611
So, one must know that seeing is not experiencing.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.275
For example, a dog sees this instrument [mike].

04:02.110 --> 04:06.158
But what does he know about it? He sees it.

04:09.447 --> 04:15.784
Awareness, the human awareness has so many great
things about itself

04:15.864 --> 04:18.974
compared to the animal\hawareness.

04:19.928 --> 04:25.590
For example, we can say the awareness of
beauty, animals don't have.

04:25.670 --> 04:30.776
Awareness of cleanliness, animals don't have.

04:30.920 --> 04:36.726
Human beings have these built within themselves.

04:36.806 --> 04:42.206
They can feel it, they\hcan feel it
on their central nervous system

04:42.620 --> 04:47.520
So, whatever is your awareness is to
be felt on your central nervous system.

04:47.600 --> 04:52.183
It's not just an imaginary thing or a intellectual
discussion,

04:52.263 --> 04:55.087
"Ah I see, yes, I know". Not that.

04:55.167 --> 04:59.165
The knowledge should come\hto you through your feelings;

05:01.520 --> 05:04.293
like I can feel this is hot or cold.

05:04.373 --> 05:08.235
But a stone\hwill not feel anything.

05:08.315 --> 05:12.100
In the same way, the feeling has to come through your central nervous system.

05:12.180 --> 05:17.058
That means your awareness itself is to be going, has to be charged.

05:17.313 --> 05:19.512
It has to get a new dimension.

05:19.592 --> 05:23.120
Your awareness itself has to get a new dimension.

05:23.265 --> 05:27.165
All other experiences has no meaning
whatsoever in evolution, if you see.

05:28.796 --> 05:33.030
In evolutionary process, it is the awareness that
improves,

05:33.110 --> 05:36.958
receives better and better dimensions.

05:37.194 --> 05:42.589
And these dimensions have reached its maximum at
the time when you become a human being,

05:42.669 --> 05:47.663
where your\hawareness is just ready to receive

05:47.743 --> 05:53.487
the awareness\hof the universal Being, of the collective Being,

05:53.567 --> 05:56.595
so that you become the collective Being.

05:56.675 --> 05:59.838
Now\hI would like to tell you about this within\hourselves,

05:59.918 --> 06:01.467
how we are placed.

06:01.628 --> 06:07.773
For every practical\hpurposes,
you should not take me for granted,

06:08.120 --> 06:11.255
but you should not also deny what I tell you.

06:11.335 --> 06:15.222
It's like entering into a new University:

06:15.740 --> 06:20.704
we listen to the professor and we try to
follow him.

06:20.784 --> 06:28.747
Supposing he propounded, he propounds a hypothesis before you,

06:28.883 --> 06:34.200
then you just\hstart judging
it, work it out.

06:34.280 --> 06:39.408
If it is true,

06:39.707 --> 06:41.696
then you call it a law.

06:41.776 --> 06:48.185
In the same way,
we should enter into this new understanding,

06:48.380 --> 06:52.128
by first seeing it, not denying it.

06:52.208 --> 06:55.825
Then if it is true, then we have to believe it.

06:55.989 --> 06:58.798
There should be no blind faith about Sahaja Yoga.

06:58.878 --> 07:01.686
Blind faith does not help at all.

07:01.777 --> 07:04.669
Neither there should be a denial.

07:04.820 --> 07:10.574
And with that cheerful attitude, if you just listen to Me as a hypothesis, whatever I'm telling you,

07:10.654 --> 07:13.549
you need not accept it as truth just now.

07:13.630 --> 07:17.540
But then the time has come for me
to prove the truth to you.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.071
And the truth can be proved to you.

07:21.180 --> 07:24.233
Time has come to prove the existence of God;

07:24.313 --> 07:28.273
to prove, not prove that

07:28.463 --> 07:32.331
I give you a big lecture or take you to course
or some sort of a thing like that.

07:32.411 --> 07:36.405
But how\ham I going to prove it? On your awareness!

07:37.640 --> 07:45.077
It is going to be absolute experience of your awareness

07:45.397 --> 07:50.180
that\hyou are going to feel God almighty.

07:51.620 --> 07:55.335
Time has come to prove the scriptures,

07:55.415 --> 07:57.516
all the scriptures.

07:58.387 --> 08:04.370
The time has come to prove your own connection with God,

08:04.450 --> 08:06.999
your own relationship with him,

08:07.079 --> 08:10.576
your own relationship with that Primordial Being,

08:10.656 --> 08:15.033
whether you call it God or anything
I it makes no difference to God himself.

08:15.113 --> 08:18.525
Whether you call him by any name there
is God.

08:18.605 --> 08:21.846
And that God is not the way you conceive God.

08:21.926 --> 08:25.793
It's not the way you understand\hGod or you know God.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.386
But it's the God as he is.
