00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.120
It’s 27 minutes to 12.
Now, I’m not going to attempt to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.800
pronounce the name of my next guest,
because I couldn’t do it justice.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.760
So, you will have to tell me
your name yourself,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.510
and pronounce it for me.
Would you like to?

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.320
All right.
Yes, please. Then what is it?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.600
My name is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.800
Now, if I’m going to use
one of those names, which one will I use?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.720
Use Mataji.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.880
Mataji, Mataji. All right.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.280
Now, welcome into the studio
this morning.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.240
In the literature which has been
handed to me about you,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.160
you are described as ‘being someone who,
in her own homeland,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160
is regarded as the
world’s greatest living saint’.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.320
Now, can you explain that to me?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.400
The saint is a personality
who is in contact with the Divine.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.440
And we had many saints before also,
all over the world,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.040
who were in contact with the Divine.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.520
And they tried to explain
what is divinity is,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.120
and that they said, all of them
inclusive of Christ,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.560
that we have to be born again,
that we have to achieve

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.320
a higher state of awareness.
But it could not be done

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.560
on a mass scale.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.200
In my lifetime, I worked out a method
by which we can have

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.640
a mass scale ascent of human beings.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.040
That’s the last breakthrough
of our evolutionary process,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.640
which is a living process
and which works out this ascent.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.200
And this is a breakthrough
that individuals can have

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.560
to some sort of higher level
of consciousness, something like that?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.880
Yes, like that.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.440
Would you explain to me
a little more about that?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.760
The higher level of consciousness,
because we have to, first of all,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.880
as a hypothesis, you can accept.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.840
But you should have an open mind
like a scientist,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.600
that we have two things
of which we are not aware.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.680
The first thing is that,
we are surrounded,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.040
or we are penetrated and looked after,
nourished, by a subtle Power

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.280
which is called as a divine Power.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.080
We can call it as a ‘Ruh’,
we can call it as the All-pervading

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.640
Power of God’s love;
call it by any name.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.480
And this Power organizes us,
looks after all living processes,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.440
does all the development and
evolution of human beings, everything.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.520
Is this what is referred to
as the Kundalini?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.472
No, not that’s. That’s not right.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.240
That’s the reflection of the Holy Ghost,
as we call it.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.440
But the Kundalini is the connection
between ourselves, our attention,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.160
and this All-pervading Power.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.560
But the result is that
in our own being,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.840
there is another great thing
called as Spirit,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.280
which is the reflection of God Almighty,
in our heart.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.880
The light of that Spirit
comes into our attention

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.800
and we become enlightened.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920
As a result,
as you ask Me the question,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.600
new awareness gives you
collective consciousness.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.880
It means you feel it,
on your central nervous system,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.800
your own subtle centres
and the centres of another person.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.680
This is called also in Sanskrit
as ‘bodha’,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.280
which is used in Buddha’s teachings,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.080
that you have to have it
on your central nervous system,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.200
you have to feel it.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.520
And the same in the early Christians,
they used to call it ‘Gnostics’.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.640
The ‘Gna’ word come from
the Sanskrit word ‘gnya’,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.840
which means you have to know it
on your central nervous system.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.560
It’s not mentally you should know.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.640
So you experience this divine somehow
in a physical sense through your body,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.920
through your nervous system?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.320
Yes.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.560
And I noticed, and this Spirit,
you experience by some sort of coolness

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.760
above your head.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.547
All over.

00:04:02.547 --> 00:04:02.560
All over.
Yes.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.960
You can feel the cool,
very slightly cooler,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.480
and it’s a kind of a vibratory awareness
you get, a vibratory awareness.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.760
Now, there are, in among the literature
that I’ve been given,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.200
photographs of people
that you are meeting.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.520
And they have there
in thousands of people

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.630
have come to your meetings in Australia
and elsewhere throughout the world.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.960
There are photographs of people
with their hands above their heads.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.240
Yes. They feel the cool breeze
coming out of their fontanel bone area.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.880
When the Kundalini pierces
through this area,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.240
that is the actualization of baptism.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.320
So this is a sort of a conduit
to the Divine

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.560
and it’s coming through
the top of their heads?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.600
Yes, also.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.000
Can anyone do this?
Could our listeners do this?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.160
So what would they have to do
to feel it?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.360
If they are listening to the radio,
and if they can put their hands

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.280
towards the radio, like this,
they might feel it,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.240
because people are quite ready to get it.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.840
Can you convey this?
Or, I mean, are you yourself

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.800
a sort of a channel
for this spiritual force?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.080
Yes, it can work out that way.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.640
Yes, right.
Does one have to believe to feel this?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.960
No, no, no.
Blind belief doesn’t help.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.120
First, you must feel it
and then believe it.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.240
It is not going to be blind belief.
You must experience it.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.120
Blind belief really leads to fanaticism.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.000
Yes. So by putting the hands out
or above the head,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.920
you feel this coolness in the palms?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.520
Yes, you can feel the coolness
coming out of your fontanel bone area

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.960
like a jet sometimes.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.240
And then you start feeling it
on your fingertips.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.280
But then you have to come to the center
to understand fully

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.640
the knowledge about it.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.000
Yes, right.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.520
Now, one of the things you have said
is that,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.240
and this is not an uncommon thing
that one hears said these days,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.280
that illness is frequently a reflection
of what you might call

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.520
a lack of balance within the personality.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.040
And I was particularly interested,
because I am a diabetic,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.360
and I see here a Mother’s
thoughtless cure for diabetes

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.640
and this story begins:

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.320
Diabetes is not the result
of taking too much sugar,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.280
but it’s caused by too much thinking,
according to you.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.240
Can you help me here
by explaining to me

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.040
how my diabetes is caused
by too much thinking?

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.000
All right.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.870
I do a great deal of thinking.
It’s quite true, by the way.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880
All right.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.560
Now you see, diabetes is caused
by an imbalance within us.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.840
There’s one center which we call
Swadisthana, the second center,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.280
which looks after the aortic plexus,
on medical terminology,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.120
can understand the physical side.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.840
Now it has got one work
of which I think the doctors

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.720
are not yet aware:
that when you think too much,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.680
your grey cells are used
and they have to be replaced.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.800
So the fat cells are converted
for the use of replacement

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.720
of those grey cells.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.200
As a result this,
the person who thinks too much,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.640
this chakra, this one what you call
the Swadisthana,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.880
goes into too much action
in converting those fat cells

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.400
for the use of the brain.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.800
So it neglects the other side of it.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.040
The other side is that
it has to look after the liver.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.720
It has to look after the pancreas.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.400
It has to look after
the spleen and the kidneys,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.760
and part of the intestines.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.280
That’s the job of this
Swadisthana centre.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.880
And when it is busy with one only,
it neglects others.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.000
As a result, the pancreas has to do
the job of not getting diabetes,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.640
or you can say of absorbing the sugar.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.400
But because the whole pressure
is on thinking, of a personality,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.760
then this Swadisthana has to work
only for this work.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.920
Now, it’s intriguing.
So too much energy is being used up

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.240
with all this cogitating and thinking,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.509
Yes. And that is the-

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:46.960
And it’s putting too much stress
on the pancreas,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.080
which can’t do its job.
Is that really what you’re saying there?

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.640
That’s an imbalance.
You see, the energy which is

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.320
for everything else,
you just spend it for one part

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.440
of the work, one function,
and the rest of the functions

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.400
are neglected.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.520
That’s how you develop liver troubles,
you get high blood pressure.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.520
The worst is blood cancer.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.600
So a remedy for this might-
is the remedy for the center

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.320
is think less?
Or spend less time

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.864
in intellectual pursuits?

00:08:14.864 --> 00:08:18.720
No, it’s not. It’s not that way.
It’s by through Kundalini awakening.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.760
Your thoughts, you see,
which are too much all the time

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.000
bombarding you –
we live on thoughts.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.600
Like one thought rises, falls off,
another thought rises, falls off.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.200
The thing between,
there’s a little space,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.760
that is for the present.
We live on the past or the future.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.120
This is a bad cough you have.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.160
Very bad, talking too much.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.720
I’m wondering whether you have been
too much thinking.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.440
Talking. No, no, not that.
Because of too much talking.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.040
Too much talking, yes!
Too much talking.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.834
Of course, yes.

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:48.800
I’m too much talking.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.920
So now what happens,
that when the Kundalini rises,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.280
we are thinking about the past
or the future all the time,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.400
not of the present.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.760
When the Kundalini rises,
our thoughts become smaller

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.240
and this area of present increases.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.440
So if you want to think, you think it.
Otherwise, you can stop thinking.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.080
So you rise into another great dimension
called as thoughtless awareness,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.400
where you can be thoughtless
and aware.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.960
Well, we’ll talk about that
in just a minute.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.080
All right, so we’ll come back
to that subject, in just a minute.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.160
Give your voice a rest
for a moment or two.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.480
Have a lolly and a cup of something.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.080
Well, I talk to John Latimer...

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.600
Hello, John.
You’re not going to talk to me?

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.440
Good morning, John.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.000
Oh! Hello, Brian. How are you?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.080
Hello, I don’t know quite what happened
there something’s strange.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.920
I’m very well.
Thank you, very well indeed.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.400
I feel sorry for that lady
with a sore throat

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.440
because I’m down with it too.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.400
Oh, are you really?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.280
Yes, this morning when I got up,
I was scared I was going to die.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.640
Now, I’m scared I won’t die.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.520
Why? Are you feeling really terrible?

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.760
Oh, the old flu back.
It’s air conditioning in the car,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.320
I think.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.280
Oh, it really is that what it is?

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.960
That is what I am blaming.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.360
What?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.600
Now this John Latimer
is one of our advertisers

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.360
and I talk to him from time to time.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.160
What can he do about his flu
and his sore throat?

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.360
Can you help him with that?
It’s a serious question.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.640
That also comes from liver problems.
You see, if you have a bad liver,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.120
then the heat rises above
and that gives you this problem

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.960
of melting your phlegm,
and that’s how you get it.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.760
Now, if you have to talk like me
all the time,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.280
then also you might get it.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.760
So you must give some rest
of your throat.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.440
Give the message to yourself.
All right.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.480
Yes, he should take a rest.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.480
Well, yes, my guess says,
“You must take a rest, John”.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.800
Go and lie on some of your
lovely carpet somewhere.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.320
And with some honey.
With hot water and honey.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:44.960
I’ve done it.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.911
Oh, he’s done.

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:46.480
And that helped me lot.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:46.800
Honey.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.840
Honey, yes. All right.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.560
Ok, John.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:48.880
Ok.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.267
Thank you very much. Bye, bye.
Thank you.

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:54.000
That’s our guest for the next ten
or fifteen minutes or so,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.120
Mataji Devi, as I said,
is described in her homeland in India,

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.280
as the world greatest living saint.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.160
In Italy, in 1986,
she was voted as the personality

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.120
of the year of there.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.640
We’ve been talking about balance
in the personality.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.680
What did I ask you
whether what you are saying

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.480
is very different as large number
of people are saying.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.440
I had numerous guests
who come on to the program,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.000
who arrange in this sort of area,
who say that,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.520
“We have lost the balance
in our lives”,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.440
that we are out of balance.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.600
Correct.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.960
The Yin and Yang or whatever you call it,
are not in balance.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.960
Are we thinking too much
and feeling too little?

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.760
Is that what one of the problems?

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.920
Balance of the sides because,
you see, right side,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.143
we have a right side and a left side.

00:11:38.143 --> 00:11:40.000
In the brain.
And two sympathetic nervous systems.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.440
Now the right-side deals
with your physical and mental aspects.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.480
It nourishes that.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.520
And the left side,
with your desire and emotions,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.960
your subconscious mind,
collective subconscious mind.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.600
So now, if you’re thinking too much,
you’re on the right side.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.560
If you’re going onto the right side
too much, naturally, you’ll feel less

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.960
because you have less of emotions.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.080
That happens and imbalances
then create problems.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.920
Now, to achieve the balance
is not to go to the left side.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.400
Like people take two drinks,
because they want to go

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.600
to the left side.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.680
But actually, the best way
is to awaken the central path.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.440
If the central path is awakened,
then both the sides are pulled in

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.320
and you get automatically balanced.
That is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.025
How do we do that?
And how do we awaken the central path?

00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:24.720
That’s what is the awakening
of this Kundalini,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.040
which is the power within you
in the triangular bone,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.480
which must be awakened,
which passes through the six centres

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.000
and makes the person
balanced automatically.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.240
It’s a spontaneous happening.
It’s a living process.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.040
It’s a spontaneous happening,
but how does one do it?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.920
It’s very simple.
As I told you, just put hands towards it.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.040
It works out.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.880
Now, supposing you get your Realization,
you can give it to others.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.040
It passes from one person to another.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.160
Like one enlightened light
enlightens another light

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.560
or another candle
which is not yet enlightened.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.440
It’s very simple.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.440
Certainly.
But now, where does one put one’s hands

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.240
to do this?

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.956
Just you –

00:12:58.956 --> 00:13:00.160
And what does one think or feel?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.760
No, no, nothing to be felt.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.560
Nothing to be felt, no?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.840
It’s just spontaneous.
Just put the hands like this

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.760
and it works. It just works.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.360
Now, my listeners can’t see that,
of course.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.040
You’re simply putting your hands
in front of you,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.120
like someone waiting
to be handed a gift.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.720
Yes. Just it works. It works.
You start feeling a cool breeze.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.600
You feel completely relaxed
and you feel the cool breeze

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.880
coming out of your head.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.600
But then you have to know
about the technique part of it.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.200
Yoga means your union with the Divine.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.880
It doesn’t mean standing on your head.
It means union with the Divine.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.040
For a lot of people,
it does mean standing on your head,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.360
you know?
Yes.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.280
A lot of people who are listening
to our program

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.600
are probably going off to yoga lessons.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:37.680
Yes that’s it. It is not.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.360
And they will regard those mainly
as physical exercise sort of sessions.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.480
No, it is to be done, exercises,
scientifically,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.800
understanding wherever is the problem.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.640
So when the Kundalini rises,
you can make out where is the problem is,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.760
where does it stop.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.360
And that is the centre to be attended to.
If you need any physical help,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.480
then you must help it.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.960
But the way people are doing yoga today
is, again,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.520
they are going onto the right side
very much.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.240
And such a person can be very dry,
can be very aggressive.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.320
So is best is to understand
the balancing process first of all.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.920
Get your full ideas
to where the is problem,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.120
and then work it out,
if you need any exercise or not,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.400
and do it accordingly.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.400
But the way people are doing these days,
yoga,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.600
is like taking all the medicine boxes
into your stomach.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.400
But you mentioned extremely serious
illnesses like cancer, blood leukaemia.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.320
Yes. There are many cases.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.920
You’re saying to me
that there are many cases

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.720
of people being cured of leukaemia
by these methods?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.560
Yes, and we have certificates of them.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.840
But people are so casual about everything.
That’s the trouble,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.720
they’re very casual.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.600
Till they get sick, they’re very casual.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.480
They don’t take things seriously
in the West, especially.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.200
But only in Russia,
I’ve found people are very serious.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.000
Even the ministry and everyone
took it so seriously,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.720
they have given us
an independent charge there.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.080
And they have seen all our certificates
and everything.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.360
You mentioned Russia just now.
And of course, at the moment,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.240
there are great changes taking place
in Russia, via Mr. Gorbachev.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.320
I think I read somewhere
in the literature about you,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.320
you thought of him as a person
who is virtually a saint.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.960
Yes, he is.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.920
Well, explain how.
Most of us thought of Russian leaders

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.040
as devils, not saints.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.720
They were. Not him.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.920
Well, tell me about him.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.800
They were.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.080
How is he a saint?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.280
You see, I must say that
he has seen the point.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.920
One thing especially,
which I always saw that,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.760
that if one side between these
two highly powered countries

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.320
decides to recede,
the other side will have to

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.120
particularly go down,
because there’s nothing to hit.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.280
And that’s what he has done.
And you can see it through his vibrations.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.160
You can feel his vibrations.
The first day I saw him,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.080
I could feel it.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.800
Tell me more. What could you see,
what could you feel?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.320
So now you see, he’s a man
who should be supported by everyone.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.320
Instead of that,
everybody’s trying to run him down

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.920
and helping him is not there.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.200
Like now, these people from other,
Ukraine, and other places,

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.360
are trying to trouble him.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.400
You must understand
they are stupid people.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.520
They don’t know what they want.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.600
Especially the Islamic people
who are fundamentalists there,

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.920
are actually helped by Iranians.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.400
And these Iranians are penetrating
into that area,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.200
and then Americans should not
support them there,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.720
I mean, in a way,
indirectly supporting Iranians.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.960
So you know what these
fundamentalists are doing.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.280
So why do you support them
against Gorbachev

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.720
who is doing a good work?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.840
So just out of competition,
we should not try to be degrade him.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.480
He is doing a good job.
You must try to understand.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.040
All right. Put in a little break.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.880
The world, of course,
is in a terrible state.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.240
We all seem to agree on that.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.160
Are you a believer in the return
of some sort of messiah or not?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.760
Or that everything is about to end?
Or there is…?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.320
No, no.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.440
No.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.360
Our creator is going to look after us.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.400
He’s not going to allow us
to destroy ourselves, at all.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.760
But we must take some sense
into our heads and understand.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.600
If something is working out,
why not pay some attention to it?

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.400
Well, Gorbachev included.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:06.800
Of course.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.520
Let’s just say we must change.
Mankind must change.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.280
In what way do we have to change?

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.360
We have to transform into a new awareness
of collective consciousness.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.320
Then there is no argument.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.640
There’s no conflict,
there’s no difference of opinion

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.720
because everybody knows the absolute truth
and they reside by it.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.120
Now we are working in 40 nations.
There’s no problem with them.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.960
Everybody is united
because you can feel the truth.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.760
There’s a very interesting hypothesis
been put forward recently

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.720
called the ‘Gaia hypothesis’.
Have you heard of this?

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.040
And it’s the idea that the universe
is sort of one being,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.480
Correct.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.280
And that we are all
sort of cells within that being.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.440
Correct.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.160
So I’m actually not separate
from the world and the things around us.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.280
Correct.
Would do, you accept that?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.680
That’s what it is and that’s what I say.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.400
You’re a part and parcel of the whole.
But you have to become.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.680
You’re not aware of it.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.738
That awareness only comes
when you get connected.

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:02.800
And getting connected to the Divine.
It is absolutely correct.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.320
And getting connected to the Divine,
so we have the Kundalini coming up,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.640
coming up through the head.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:07.760
Yes.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.360
Through the fontanel area,
is that what you say?

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.880
Yes. Just like this connection
as to be to the mains.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.440
And what’s going to happen to me?
If I achieve this,

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.600
then what will I feel and experience?

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.200
The first experience will be, of course,
of a cool breeze and all that.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.960
But then you can feel your own centres
on your fingertips, you see.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.160
You can feel what problems you have.
If you know how to correct them,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.760
you get corrected yourself.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.840
You can feel the centres of others,
and if you know what is wrong with them

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.240
and if you know how to correct them,
you can get them corrected.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.520
This is fairly extraordinary!

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.640
No, nothing. It’s simple.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.480
Now what’s extraordinary is that
I have this cool spot

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.600
above my left hand.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.800
Good, great.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.000
I’m quite serious!

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.480
That’s quite extraordinary.
I have this, quite like a breeze,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:50.797
Yes, it’s, that’ it.

00:19:50.797 --> 00:19:52.320
In my left hand just sitting here.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.600
So, now.
Now see your diabetes disappear very soon.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.440
No, let’s try that.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.760
No, I don’t feel the cool.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.040
I feel I’m actually holding it.
Because there’s a little-

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.680
Because there’s a little imbalance,
as I told you.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.920
That will work out.
Right side is the problem.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.280
But now it will work out, very soon.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.440
Now, has this got to do
with you being here?

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.640
That I’m feeling that or not?

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.040
Yes, of course. Yes.
I must admit it very humbly.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.280
That’s quite extraordinary!
I’m not telling you. It’s there!

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.400
Now it’s there on your head also.
Can you feel it?

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.880
Yes, it’s there too.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.480
Yes.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.613
It’s quite extraordinary.
I’m not joking. I am not making this up.

00:20:28.613 --> 00:20:28.640
You have to be honest, yes.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.680
I’m probably the most sceptical person
on this station.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.693
I have a cool puddle of air.

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:34.720
That’s what I’m saying.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.200
Above my left hand. And-
See now.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.640
Now that’s what I’m saying.
It’s so easy,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.240
but people don’t take to anything.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.240
They want Me to charge
some money for them.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.240
Now, how much would I charge
for this invaluable thing?

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.120
Well, as I’ve got the cool air
above my hand,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.560
and the breeze above my head.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.040
Of course.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.480
So I’m on the way now.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.640
On the way to being all right
with your diabetes.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.080
I may be able to chuck away
the little thing

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.800
I have to pierce my finger with
every day to check my diabetes.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.680
So, you’d better see these people
and get your diabetes all right.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.280
I have it in my hand. I’m serious.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.080
I’ve got Sue and Tansley there
looking at me as if I was mad,

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.106
and I have this ball of cold air
between my hand.

00:21:15.106 --> 00:21:18.880
Just see now. See, you’re a seeker
of truth. That’s why you got it.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.160
They’re all out here laughing.
It’s absolutely the case.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.080
No, I’m quite serious. It’s there.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.760
I came in here,
really sceptical of this,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.792
totally sceptical of this,

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:30.160
“Well another silly woman’s coming in
to tell me a lot of rubbish”.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.360
And it is quite-
It’s there, yes.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.320
It’s quite, that’s good.
It’s there.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.480
Yes. And that’s the trouble is.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.120
It’s all around the place now.
So this is very much.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.880
We may have to take this up
again someday, I think,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.880
because I’ve run out of time
his morning.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.600
But I will give you
my unqualified recommendation that,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.360
that happened.
That has just happened to me,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.393
quite extraordinary.

00:21:52.393 --> 00:21:53.360
And if your diabetes is cured.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.640
Moving around with my hand.
Moving around.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.360
And if your diabetes also is cured.
Then you have to say ‘yes’.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.800
Then I’ll say ‘yes’. I will.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.560
All right. Thank you very much.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.600
You can call him sometime.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.000
I will.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.520
And he would be of help.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.160
All right, fine.
Biran could be of help to you.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.920
OK. I will.
Thank you very much for coming in.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.339
We’ve run out of time.

00:22:09.339 --> 00:22:09.360
All right, thank you.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.840
We’ll leave your number,
if people want to find out where you are,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.640
at the station.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.000
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much. Bye.
