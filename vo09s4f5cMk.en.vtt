00:07:42.602 --> 00:07:52.752
This place, Nasik, has a special significance,
that long time back, say about eight thousands

00:07:52.752 --> 00:08:06.052
years back, when Shri Rama went away for His
exile, He came to Maharashtra and He passed

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:19.393
through various places and He settled down
in Nasik, this place, with His wife.

00:08:19.393 --> 00:08:33.842
And here a lady who was actually the wife,
was the sister of Ravana, called Shurpanakha,

00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:44.473
she tried to entice Shri Rama.

00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:59.943
Now this quality of enticing men or enticing
women are really demonic and that is how people

00:08:59.943 --> 00:09:02.983
call them rakshasas.

00:09:02.983 --> 00:09:16.753
Because those who are demonic people are people
who are by nature aggressive, full of ego,

00:09:16.753 --> 00:09:23.463
who want to overpower everyone.

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:29.363
And they feel quite satisfied if their ego
is satisfied.

00:09:29.363 --> 00:09:37.223
So all the people who were like that, were
called as rakshasas in this country.

00:09:37.223 --> 00:09:45.643
Was not a normal human behavior, according
to them.

00:09:45.643 --> 00:10:03.133
So these rakshasas were more living in the
northern part, northern most part of India

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:08.113
and they have different categories like described.

00:10:08.113 --> 00:10:14.083
So those who run after women were called by
some other name and where the women tried

00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:16.693
to dominate them are called by some other
name.

00:10:16.693 --> 00:10:24.503
Where the men tried to become like women,
there is another name.

00:10:24.503 --> 00:10:27.473
But they were never called as human beings.

00:10:27.473 --> 00:10:36.533
They were called as “Rakshasas” or “Betalas”
and all other names.

00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:45.593
But now-a-days you find such a confusion that
you don’t know whom to call what.

00:10:45.593 --> 00:10:56.153
But the human beings in those days were sensible,
matured, deep, who with the age matured.

00:10:56.153 --> 00:11:05.163
Now you have to notice on the streets of Maharashtra,
just now I was coming by train, I saw, no

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:11.613
men, there were nobody who were interested
in women, no women were interested in men,

00:11:11.613 --> 00:11:15.953
some men were hugging each other, walking
around, holding innocently.

00:11:15.953 --> 00:11:27.283
I mean, the whole thing was, that life is
innocence.

00:11:27.283 --> 00:11:31.483
And that is what it was here when this rakshasa’s
sister, Shurpanakha.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:37.323
So nowadays, if there is a woman in India
who behaves like that, tries to entice men

00:11:37.323 --> 00:11:41.203
is called Shurpanakha.

00:11:41.203 --> 00:11:43.983
So this woman came and tried to entice Shri
Rama.

00:11:43.983 --> 00:11:46.313
Imagine what audacity.

00:11:46.313 --> 00:11:57.293
So, Shri Rama being sankochit, he was a man
full of grace, He told her, “See now, what’s

00:11:57.293 --> 00:11:58.753
the use of running after Me?

00:11:58.753 --> 00:12:02.343
I’ve already got a beautiful wife.

00:12:02.343 --> 00:12:05.183
So why do you run after Me?

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:13.843
Better try My brother who has no wife.

00:12:13.843 --> 00:12:27.013
” Because He knew that His brother is a
Sheshnaga, he is the serpent on which, very

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:31.003
big serpent called Shesha, Shesha.

00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:38.473
And he is a hot tempered fellow and he will
just know how to deal with this woman and

00:12:38.473 --> 00:12:40.223
“I can’t manage this show.

00:12:40.223 --> 00:12:44.023
” Because He would not ill-treat a woman,
it was too much for Him.

00:12:44.023 --> 00:12:51.913
Though she was Shurpanakha, and not only that,
but she was also a woman.

00:12:51.913 --> 00:13:04.473
So when He went, no, He asked her that, “You
go and see him.

00:13:04.473 --> 00:13:07.783
” Lakshmana was sitting outside.

00:13:07.783 --> 00:13:18.862
Lakshmana had taken a vow to be a brahmachari,
a celibate man, with fourteen years penance,

00:13:18.862 --> 00:13:21.433
though he was a married man.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:29.293
This he had to do and that’s the only way
he could kill another demon, whose name was

00:13:29.293 --> 00:13:36.533
Meghnad, who had run away with his daughter,
called as Sulochana.

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:39.253
It’s a long story.

00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:48.332
So, make it short, this fellow went to this
brahmachari, Lakshmana, thou he had a wife

00:13:48.332 --> 00:13:52.773
in Ayodhya, was leading a life of brahmachari.

00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:55.533
It is very common in India.

00:13:55.533 --> 00:14:03.183
I mean, if your wife is away, you just think
about her, and you are in separation, still

00:14:03.183 --> 00:14:05.583
you enjoy your wife thinking about her.

00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:07.873
You think about the good things she has done
to you.

00:14:07.873 --> 00:14:12.263
But if she has done all the time bad things,
you don’t want too think about her.

00:14:12.263 --> 00:14:14.763
And then all these demonic things start.

00:14:14.763 --> 00:14:17.013
All right.

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:21.403
So this, when she went and started.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:28.213
She dressed up very well, in a very attractive
manner, tried to show off her body and all

00:14:28.213 --> 00:14:35.583
that, in a very funny way, and not in the
traditional, decent way, but a very indecent,

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:39.373
indecorous manner, just to attract.

00:14:39.373 --> 00:14:46.263
He was so angry with her, He just cut her
nose.

00:14:46.263 --> 00:14:54.393
So she should not do this to anybody else
and get rid of her pride of nonsense, to kill

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:55.913
her ego.

00:14:55.913 --> 00:15:04.053
Because nose is the one that expresses actually
the ego part.

00:15:04.053 --> 00:15:13.373
So when he cut his nose, the nose is called
as nasika, in Sanskrit, is called as nasika.

00:15:13.373 --> 00:15:21.053
This was the place where the nose was cut
and that’s why this place was called as

00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:22.343
Nasik.

00:15:22.343 --> 00:15:41.383
So now we have to remember we have come to
an area where noses can be cut.

00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:56.063
So one has to be careful
and on the watch out that we do not show any,

00:15:56.063 --> 00:16:01.623
any symptom that Shurpanakha did, hence forth.

00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:09.503
We should behave in a manner that we are Sahaja
Yogis and Sahaja Yoginis.

00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:24.493
And we have to have that right type of conduct
which comes from the purity inside.

00:16:24.493 --> 00:16:35.633
So, as this is now actually the beginning
of the tour in the real sense of the word,

00:16:35.633 --> 00:16:47.243
I have to make certain suggestions to all
of you, that our behavior should be very decent

00:16:47.243 --> 00:16:59.993
and decorous so that all the vibrations that
are flowing through us, which are holy vibrations,

00:16:59.993 --> 00:17:10.452
auspicious vibrations, should not be spoiled
by our ego or our Shurpanakha ideas, or any

00:17:10.452 --> 00:17:16.853
such nonsense which has no relevance to your
ascent.

00:17:16.853 --> 00:17:23.082
All these come from decadence, the decadence
we have gone through.

00:17:23.082 --> 00:17:26.902
And because you have come up you can see the
decadence of the society.

00:17:26.902 --> 00:17:37.572
So here you have to show through your good
behavior, good dress and good conduct, the

00:17:37.572 --> 00:17:44.932
beauty that you have developed within yourself
and that now you belong to a society which

00:17:44.932 --> 00:17:49.272
has ascent and the decadence is over now.

00:17:49.272 --> 00:18:01.433
It is only for you to watch that and to help
others to come out of it.

00:18:01.433 --> 00:18:07.702
Beginning of the tour at Nasik is a very holy
and auspicious thing that has happened to

00:18:07.702 --> 00:18:10.073
all of you.

00:18:10.073 --> 00:18:17.952
Because the river here Godhavari is called
as the Ganges of the south.

00:18:17.952 --> 00:18:30.342
But as in every pure thing all the filth is
put in, this great kshetra, the pilgrimage,

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:37.462
is ruined by many people who want to exploit.

00:18:37.462 --> 00:18:39.182
We call them as “vadjees”.

00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:45.702
They are the ones who are making money out
of the temples, out of the holiness of this

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:47.142
place.

00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:53.923
To them Sahaja Yoga is a challenge because
you can do it without any money, without any

00:18:53.923 --> 00:19:01.913
work, without any extra sacrifices.

00:19:01.913 --> 00:19:05.522
That they can’t understand.

00:19:05.522 --> 00:19:11.773
According to the theory of all these people,
all over the world, if you see, is this, that

00:19:11.773 --> 00:19:17.703
all those who are seeking should hand over
the purse to the people who are in charge,

00:19:17.703 --> 00:19:19.062
first of all.

00:19:19.062 --> 00:19:24.222
Secondly, those who are seeking should become
absolutely miserable in their seeking.

00:19:24.222 --> 00:19:27.203
They should suffer, suffer and suffer.

00:19:27.203 --> 00:19:31.572
Till they become just bones and die.

00:19:31.572 --> 00:19:38.712
They have to go on sacrificing everything,
going through tortures till they reach God.

00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:44.712
This is not the way the ascent has to be achieved,
as you have learned it.

00:19:44.712 --> 00:19:55.752
This is true not only of Hindus, also of Jains,
also of Christianity, also of Islam.

00:19:55.752 --> 00:20:01.553
The way it is preached today is all adharma,
there is no dharma in it.

00:20:01.553 --> 00:20:09.652
That’s why the establishment of our dharma
is very important, which is the pure religion

00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:19.532
which gives you ascent, joy, peace and the
blessings of God.

00:20:19.532 --> 00:20:27.133
This is what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:33.413
Now I have to also say that this place has
another significance that we have a very powerful

00:20:33.413 --> 00:20:39.502
Jain, a gentleman who has come to this dharma.

00:20:39.502 --> 00:20:46.392
Now, Jainism again the same style it’s going,
same perversions as we have seen.

00:20:46.392 --> 00:20:51.923
Like about Jains if I’m going tell you,
you will laugh and laugh, and laugh and just

00:20:51.923 --> 00:20:52.923
won’t stop.

00:20:52.923 --> 00:20:55.032
So I don’t want to go about it.

00:20:55.032 --> 00:20:58.962
Again, the Jains are mad about vegetarianism.

00:20:58.962 --> 00:21:04.252
They want to save all the mosquitoes, bugs,
everything and kill the human beings, all

00:21:04.252 --> 00:21:05.923
right, with money.

00:21:05.923 --> 00:21:11.332
They are the Jews of our country and they
have really extracted people, their money

00:21:11.332 --> 00:21:12.332
and everything.

00:21:12.332 --> 00:21:19.673
Very rich people here but they don’t kill
a mosquito or kill a bug.

00:21:19.673 --> 00:21:21.712
That’s what they are.

00:21:21.712 --> 00:21:30.603
So now this kind of thing is on and doctor
Sanghvi, who is a very learned man, his wife

00:21:30.603 --> 00:21:37.803
is another very affectionate and dedicated
Sahaja Yogini, the son, daughter in law, all

00:21:37.803 --> 00:21:45.063
of them have understood that religion cannot
be such madness that you start saving the

00:21:45.063 --> 00:21:46.772
mosquitoes and not the human beings.

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:53.923
The attention is from the other end, which,
of course, against Mahavira’s principle.

00:21:53.923 --> 00:21:57.512
Mahavira on the contrary had described the
hell the best.

00:21:57.512 --> 00:22:06.923
He is the one who being the Incarnation of
the essence of Bhairava and described the

00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:07.992
hell very well.

00:22:07.992 --> 00:22:13.543
And in England we have William Blake, who
has also done the same way because he is the

00:22:13.543 --> 00:22:17.702
same style, he is the same thing.

00:22:17.702 --> 00:22:22.242
What is hell that he described, there are
worms, there are mosquitoes, this, that.

00:22:22.242 --> 00:22:27.923
And just the opposite of that is to save the
mosquitoes and bugs, shows how we go just

00:22:27.923 --> 00:22:36.663
the other way round, how we oppose the religious
achievements of these great people, those

00:22:36.663 --> 00:22:42.423
who tried to teach something sensible, how
they make a nonsense out of it.

00:22:42.423 --> 00:22:56.642
That is how, here we see that the Jains should
see how Shri Mahavira is being misinterpreted

00:22:56.642 --> 00:22:59.642
and insulted in many ways.

00:22:59.642 --> 00:23:05.752
This is a very big achievement I feel that
some people have started seeing this light

00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:09.572
and they will start seeing it more and more.

00:23:09.572 --> 00:23:20.423
Also we have some very good here musicians,
as you have heard him and it’s a whole party

00:23:20.423 --> 00:23:26.493
was so beautiful, I heard about him, that
he sang beautiful songs for you and you enjoyed

00:23:26.493 --> 00:23:28.113
all the music program.

00:23:28.113 --> 00:23:32.853
And he also sang some very nice English songs.

00:23:32.853 --> 00:23:35.082
It’s a good beginning.

00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:42.212
Because as you are singing Marathi songs and
Hindi songs, our Indians also should sing.

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:47.052
But they make a melody out of everything.

00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:53.192
So you have to little bit guide them, because
they are, you see, they are melody oriented

00:23:53.192 --> 00:23:55.192
musicians.

00:23:55.192 --> 00:24:01.242
So we try to make melody out of everything,
otherwise it doesn’t go with our minds all

00:24:01.242 --> 00:24:02.242
right.

00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:05.722
So you have to give some guidance and you
have to forgive them if you think it is not

00:24:05.722 --> 00:24:12.452
absolutely all right.

00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:20.302
So we have to thank all the people over here
for being so kind and so nice to us, and the

00:24:20.302 --> 00:24:21.302
singing.

00:24:21.302 --> 00:24:24.562
And I hope you are all very comfortable in
that place.

00:24:24.562 --> 00:24:32.383
The only problem was we couldn’t get a proper
place, as doctor Sanghvi was worried.

00:24:32.383 --> 00:24:35.152
Because, you see, Indians are too much hospitable.

00:24:35.152 --> 00:24:40.022
And he said, “I’ll have to cover all the
sides, I don’t want them to get the cold,

00:24:40.022 --> 00:24:41.022
this, that.

00:24:41.022 --> 00:24:43.022
I’ll put some heaters there.

00:24:43.022 --> 00:24:50.433
” But by God’s grace, there’s no need.

00:24:50.433 --> 00:24:51.923
And so pleasant.

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:56.183
I was just smiling at him, I said, “don’t
you worry, everything will work out.

00:24:56.183 --> 00:25:00.903
” And it has worked out, you know, we don’t
need any heaters, and if we need anything,

00:25:00.903 --> 00:25:05.383
we might need some fans.

00:25:05.383 --> 00:25:10.723
Like in Madras they said, “We have no water,
we have to buy water now from other places

00:25:10.723 --> 00:25:13.403
going to be, we are all going to be dying.

00:25:13.403 --> 00:25:18.483
” I said, “All right, you’ll have water.

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:25.773
” So it rained, rained, rained so much that
they had floods.

00:25:25.773 --> 00:25:35.653
So it should not be felt that there is a problem
with the nature.

00:25:35.653 --> 00:25:39.113
Nature is always with you, will always help
you, will be kind.

00:25:39.113 --> 00:25:43.453
But we have to be kind to ourselves, to our
nature.

00:25:43.453 --> 00:25:48.183
The nature that we have is that we are human
beings, we are not rakshasas, we are not devils,

00:25:48.183 --> 00:25:58.113
we can’t do all these things which are devilish,
which are nonsensical.

00:25:58.113 --> 00:26:09.143
And once we understand that we are saints,
we will know that we have to keep our saintly

00:26:09.143 --> 00:26:17.003
hood in such a manner that others can see
through our behavior.

00:26:17.003 --> 00:26:26.313
Nasik has another great heritage that many
saints came and did tapasyas, tapoguni.

00:26:26.313 --> 00:26:36.383
Nasik area is the tapoguni, is the land of
tapas, tapasyas and that’s why this is a

00:26:36.383 --> 00:26:40.003
very, very auspicious land.

00:26:40.003 --> 00:26:41.983
And here it is.

00:26:41.983 --> 00:27:01.763
You will see on your way to Dhulia, the Incarnation
of the Adi Shakti, which is the three powers

00:27:01.763 --> 00:27:29.173
of the Kundalini completely integrated, expressed
here as Sapta Shringi, meaning seven peaks.

00:27:29.173 --> 00:27:34.813
Now seven peaks are the seven centers in the
brain.

00:27:34.813 --> 00:27:44.923
And the Kundalini, though she has seven centers
to pass through, the governing pithas, the

00:27:44.923 --> 00:27:56.713
seats, are in the peak, in the head and so
Adi Shakti takes place in the Sahastrara.

00:27:56.713 --> 00:27:58.983
She incarnates in the Sahastrara.

00:27:58.983 --> 00:28:07.313
So we can say that this is the Sahastrara
of Maharashtra, or of the Universe in a way,

00:28:07.313 --> 00:28:16.273
though Himalaya is regarded as the real abode
of Sadashiva, which is on top.

00:28:16.273 --> 00:28:23.783
But the Sahastrara part, which is the limbic
area, should be here because we have three

00:28:23.783 --> 00:28:26.743
and a half coils settled here.

00:28:26.743 --> 00:28:30.893
That’s why the Kundalini of the Universe
is here.

00:28:30.893 --> 00:28:41.653
But as the Sapta Shringi has come out of Mother
Earth, this is the place where we can say

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:42.993
resides the Sahastrara.

00:28:42.993 --> 00:28:53.583
Though the, on top is the Himalaya, and Himalaya
we can say is beyond Sahastrara, the three

00:28:53.583 --> 00:29:00.543
powers of the Goddess I don’t know if you’ll
be seeing all these, three expressed in three

00:29:00.543 --> 00:29:06.963
different places in the Maharashtra, but this
is the Ardha Matra, the half Matra, which

00:29:06.963 --> 00:29:10.123
is the Adi Shakti Herself.

00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:18.803
And this is what you see in this place and
I’m sure you’ll enjoy it tomorrow when

00:29:18.803 --> 00:29:21.983
you go on your way to Dhulia.

00:29:21.983 --> 00:29:31.973
With this understanding that in a subtle way
we are in a very important place, I hope you

00:29:31.973 --> 00:29:52.653
all will raise above mundane gross attention
into a subtler attention, into a higher attention and enjoy  the bliss of God.

00:29:52.653 --> 00:29:55.073
May God bless you.
