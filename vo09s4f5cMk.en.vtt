07:42.602 --> 07:52.752
This place, Nasik, has a special significance,
that long time back, say about eight thousands

07:52.752 --> 08:06.052
years back, when Shri Rama went away for His
exile, He came to Maharashtra and He passed

08:06.052 --> 08:19.393
through various places and He settled down
in Nasik, this place, with His wife.

08:19.393 --> 08:33.842
And here a lady who was actually the wife,
was the sister of Ravana, called Shurpanakha,

08:33.842 --> 08:44.473
she tried to entice Shri Rama.

08:44.473 --> 08:59.943
Now this quality of enticing men or enticing
women are really demonic and that is how people

08:59.943 --> 09:02.983
call them rakshasas.

09:02.983 --> 09:16.753
Because those who are demonic people are people
who are by nature aggressive, full of ego,

09:16.753 --> 09:23.463
who want to overpower everyone.

09:23.463 --> 09:29.363
And they feel quite satisfied if their ego
is satisfied.

09:29.363 --> 09:37.223
So all the people who were like that, were
called as rakshasas in this country.

09:37.223 --> 09:45.643
Was not a normal human behavior, according
to them.

09:45.643 --> 10:03.133
So these rakshasas were more living in the
northern part, northern most part of India

10:03.133 --> 10:08.113
and they have different categories like described.

10:08.113 --> 10:14.083
So those who run after women were called by
some other name and where the women tried

10:14.083 --> 10:16.693
to dominate them are called by some other
name.

10:16.693 --> 10:24.503
Where the men tried to become like women,
there is another name.

10:24.503 --> 10:27.473
But they were never called as human beings.

10:27.473 --> 10:36.533
They were called as “Rakshasas” or “Betalas”
and all other names.

10:36.533 --> 10:45.593
But now-a-days you find such a confusion that
you don’t know whom to call what.

10:45.593 --> 10:56.153
But the human beings in those days were sensible,
matured, deep, who with the age matured.

10:56.153 --> 11:05.163
Now you have to notice on the streets of Maharashtra,
just now I was coming by train, I saw, no

11:05.163 --> 11:11.613
men, there were nobody who were interested
in women, no women were interested in men,

11:11.613 --> 11:15.953
some men were hugging each other, walking
around, holding innocently.

11:15.953 --> 11:27.283
I mean, the whole thing was, that life is
innocence.

11:27.283 --> 11:31.483
And that is what it was here when this rakshasa’s
sister, Shurpanakha.

11:31.483 --> 11:37.323
So nowadays, if there is a woman in India
who behaves like that, tries to entice men

11:37.323 --> 11:41.203
is called Shurpanakha.

11:41.203 --> 11:43.983
So this woman came and tried to entice Shri
Rama.

11:43.983 --> 11:46.313
Imagine what audacity.

11:46.313 --> 11:57.293
So, Shri Rama being sankochit, he was a man
full of grace, He told her, “See now, what’s

11:57.293 --> 11:58.753
the use of running after Me?

11:58.753 --> 12:02.343
I’ve already got a beautiful wife.

12:02.343 --> 12:05.183
So why do you run after Me?

12:05.183 --> 12:13.843
Better try My brother who has no wife.

12:13.843 --> 12:27.013
” Because He knew that His brother is a
Sheshnaga, he is the serpent on which, very

12:27.013 --> 12:31.003
big serpent called Shesha, Shesha.

12:31.003 --> 12:38.473
And he is a hot tempered fellow and he will
just know how to deal with this woman and

12:38.473 --> 12:40.223
“I can’t manage this show.

12:40.223 --> 12:44.023
” Because He would not ill-treat a woman,
it was too much for Him.

12:44.023 --> 12:51.913
Though she was Shurpanakha, and not only that,
but she was also a woman.

12:51.913 --> 13:04.473
So when He went, no, He asked her that, “You
go and see him.

13:04.473 --> 13:07.783
” Lakshmana was sitting outside.

13:07.783 --> 13:18.862
Lakshmana had taken a vow to be a brahmachari,
a celibate man, with fourteen years penance,

13:18.862 --> 13:21.433
though he was a married man.

13:21.433 --> 13:29.293
This he had to do and that’s the only way
he could kill another demon, whose name was

13:29.293 --> 13:36.533
Meghnad, who had run away with his daughter,
called as Sulochana.

13:36.533 --> 13:39.253
It’s a long story.

13:39.253 --> 13:48.332
So, make it short, this fellow went to this
brahmachari, Lakshmana, thou he had a wife

13:48.332 --> 13:52.773
in Ayodhya, was leading a life of brahmachari.

13:52.773 --> 13:55.533
It is very common in India.

13:55.533 --> 14:03.183
I mean, if your wife is away, you just think
about her, and you are in separation, still

14:03.183 --> 14:05.583
you enjoy your wife thinking about her.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.873
You think about the good things she has done
to you.

14:07.873 --> 14:12.263
But if she has done all the time bad things,
you don’t want too think about her.

14:12.263 --> 14:14.763
And then all these demonic things start.

14:14.763 --> 14:17.013
All right.

14:17.013 --> 14:21.403
So this, when she went and started.

14:21.403 --> 14:28.213
She dressed up very well, in a very attractive
manner, tried to show off her body and all

14:28.213 --> 14:35.583
that, in a very funny way, and not in the
traditional, decent way, but a very indecent,

14:35.583 --> 14:39.373
indecorous manner, just to attract.

14:39.373 --> 14:46.263
He was so angry with her, He just cut her
nose.

14:46.263 --> 14:54.393
So she should not do this to anybody else
and get rid of her pride of nonsense, to kill

14:54.393 --> 14:55.913
her ego.

14:55.913 --> 15:04.053
Because nose is the one that expresses actually
the ego part.

15:04.053 --> 15:13.373
So when he cut his nose, the nose is called
as nasika, in Sanskrit, is called as nasika.

15:13.373 --> 15:21.053
This was the place where the nose was cut
and that’s why this place was called as

15:21.053 --> 15:22.343
Nasik.

15:22.343 --> 15:41.383
So now we have to remember we have come to
an area where noses can be cut.

15:41.383 --> 15:56.063
So one has to be careful
and on the watch out that we do not show any,

15:56.063 --> 16:01.623
any symptom that Shurpanakha did, hence forth.

16:01.623 --> 16:09.503
We should behave in a manner that we are Sahaja
Yogis and Sahaja Yoginis.

16:09.503 --> 16:24.493
And we have to have that right type of conduct
which comes from the purity inside.

16:24.493 --> 16:35.633
So, as this is now actually the beginning
of the tour in the real sense of the word,

16:35.633 --> 16:47.243
I have to make certain suggestions to all
of you, that our behavior should be very decent

16:47.243 --> 16:59.993
and decorous so that all the vibrations that
are flowing through us, which are holy vibrations,

16:59.993 --> 17:10.452
auspicious vibrations, should not be spoiled
by our ego or our Shurpanakha ideas, or any

17:10.452 --> 17:16.853
such nonsense which has no relevance to your
ascent.

17:16.853 --> 17:23.082
All these come from decadence, the decadence
we have gone through.

17:23.082 --> 17:26.902
And because you have come up you can see the
decadence of the society.

17:26.902 --> 17:37.572
So here you have to show through your good
behavior, good dress and good conduct, the

17:37.572 --> 17:44.932
beauty that you have developed within yourself
and that now you belong to a society which

17:44.932 --> 17:49.272
has ascent and the decadence is over now.

17:49.272 --> 18:01.433
It is only for you to watch that and to help
others to come out of it.

18:01.433 --> 18:07.702
Beginning of the tour at Nasik is a very holy
and auspicious thing that has happened to

18:07.702 --> 18:10.073
all of you.

18:10.073 --> 18:17.952
Because the river here Godhavari is called
as the Ganges of the south.

18:17.952 --> 18:30.342
But as in every pure thing all the filth is
put in, this great kshetra, the pilgrimage,

18:30.342 --> 18:37.462
is ruined by many people who want to exploit.

18:37.462 --> 18:39.182
We call them as “vadjees”.

18:39.182 --> 18:45.702
They are the ones who are making money out
of the temples, out of the holiness of this

18:45.702 --> 18:47.142
place.

18:47.142 --> 18:53.923
To them Sahaja Yoga is a challenge because
you can do it without any money, without any

18:53.923 --> 19:01.913
work, without any extra sacrifices.

19:01.913 --> 19:05.522
That they can’t understand.

19:05.522 --> 19:11.773
According to the theory of all these people,
all over the world, if you see, is this, that

19:11.773 --> 19:17.703
all those who are seeking should hand over
the purse to the people who are in charge,

19:17.703 --> 19:19.062
first of all.

19:19.062 --> 19:24.222
Secondly, those who are seeking should become
absolutely miserable in their seeking.

19:24.222 --> 19:27.203
They should suffer, suffer and suffer.

19:27.203 --> 19:31.572
Till they become just bones and die.

19:31.572 --> 19:38.712
They have to go on sacrificing everything,
going through tortures till they reach God.

19:38.712 --> 19:44.712
This is not the way the ascent has to be achieved,
as you have learned it.

19:44.712 --> 19:55.752
This is true not only of Hindus, also of Jains,
also of Christianity, also of Islam.

19:55.752 --> 20:01.553
The way it is preached today is all adharma,
there is no dharma in it.

20:01.553 --> 20:09.652
That’s why the establishment of our dharma
is very important, which is the pure religion

20:09.652 --> 20:19.532
which gives you ascent, joy, peace and the
blessings of God.

20:19.532 --> 20:27.133
This is what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

20:27.133 --> 20:33.413
Now I have to also say that this place has
another significance that we have a very powerful

20:33.413 --> 20:39.502
Jain, a gentleman who has come to this dharma.

20:39.502 --> 20:46.392
Now, Jainism again the same style it’s going,
same perversions as we have seen.

20:46.392 --> 20:51.923
Like about Jains if I’m going tell you,
you will laugh and laugh, and laugh and just

20:51.923 --> 20:52.923
won’t stop.

20:52.923 --> 20:55.032
So I don’t want to go about it.

20:55.032 --> 20:58.962
Again, the Jains are mad about vegetarianism.

20:58.962 --> 21:04.252
They want to save all the mosquitoes, bugs,
everything and kill the human beings, all

21:04.252 --> 21:05.923
right, with money.

21:05.923 --> 21:11.332
They are the Jews of our country and they
have really extracted people, their money

21:11.332 --> 21:12.332
and everything.

21:12.332 --> 21:19.673
Very rich people here but they don’t kill
a mosquito or kill a bug.

21:19.673 --> 21:21.712
That’s what they are.

21:21.712 --> 21:30.603
So now this kind of thing is on and doctor
Sanghvi, who is a very learned man, his wife

21:30.603 --> 21:37.803
is another very affectionate and dedicated
Sahaja Yogini, the son, daughter in law, all

21:37.803 --> 21:45.063
of them have understood that religion cannot
be such madness that you start saving the

21:45.063 --> 21:46.772
mosquitoes and not the human beings.

21:46.772 --> 21:53.923
The attention is from the other end, which,
of course, against Mahavira’s principle.

21:53.923 --> 21:57.512
Mahavira on the contrary had described the
hell the best.

21:57.512 --> 22:06.923
He is the one who being the Incarnation of
the essence of Bhairava and described the

22:06.923 --> 22:07.992
hell very well.

22:07.992 --> 22:13.543
And in England we have William Blake, who
has also done the same way because he is the

22:13.543 --> 22:17.702
same style, he is the same thing.

22:17.702 --> 22:22.242
What is hell that he described, there are
worms, there are mosquitoes, this, that.

22:22.242 --> 22:27.923
And just the opposite of that is to save the
mosquitoes and bugs, shows how we go just

22:27.923 --> 22:36.663
the other way round, how we oppose the religious
achievements of these great people, those

22:36.663 --> 22:42.423
who tried to teach something sensible, how
they make a nonsense out of it.

22:42.423 --> 22:56.642
That is how, here we see that the Jains should
see how Shri Mahavira is being misinterpreted

22:56.642 --> 22:59.642
and insulted in many ways.

22:59.642 --> 23:05.752
This is a very big achievement I feel that
some people have started seeing this light

23:05.752 --> 23:09.572
and they will start seeing it more and more.

23:09.572 --> 23:20.423
Also we have some very good here musicians,
as you have heard him and it’s a whole party

23:20.423 --> 23:26.493
was so beautiful, I heard about him, that
he sang beautiful songs for you and you enjoyed

23:26.493 --> 23:28.113
all the music program.

23:28.113 --> 23:32.853
And he also sang some very nice English songs.

23:32.853 --> 23:35.082
It’s a good beginning.

23:35.082 --> 23:42.212
Because as you are singing Marathi songs and
Hindi songs, our Indians also should sing.

23:42.212 --> 23:47.052
But they make a melody out of everything.

23:47.052 --> 23:53.192
So you have to little bit guide them, because
they are, you see, they are melody oriented

23:53.192 --> 23:55.192
musicians.

23:55.192 --> 24:01.242
So we try to make melody out of everything,
otherwise it doesn’t go with our minds all

24:01.242 --> 24:02.242
right.

24:02.242 --> 24:05.722
So you have to give some guidance and you
have to forgive them if you think it is not

24:05.722 --> 24:12.452
absolutely all right.

24:12.452 --> 24:20.302
So we have to thank all the people over here
for being so kind and so nice to us, and the

24:20.302 --> 24:21.302
singing.

24:21.302 --> 24:24.562
And I hope you are all very comfortable in
that place.

24:24.562 --> 24:32.383
The only problem was we couldn’t get a proper
place, as doctor Sanghvi was worried.

24:32.383 --> 24:35.152
Because, you see, Indians are too much hospitable.

24:35.152 --> 24:40.022
And he said, “I’ll have to cover all the
sides, I don’t want them to get the cold,

24:40.022 --> 24:41.022
this, that.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.022
I’ll put some heaters there.

24:43.022 --> 24:50.433
” But by God’s grace, there’s no need.

24:50.433 --> 24:51.923
And so pleasant.

24:51.923 --> 24:56.183
I was just smiling at him, I said, “don’t
you worry, everything will work out.

24:56.183 --> 25:00.903
” And it has worked out, you know, we don’t
need any heaters, and if we need anything,

25:00.903 --> 25:05.383
we might need some fans.

25:05.383 --> 25:10.723
Like in Madras they said, “We have no water,
we have to buy water now from other places

25:10.723 --> 25:13.403
going to be, we are all going to be dying.

25:13.403 --> 25:18.483
” I said, “All right, you’ll have water.

25:18.483 --> 25:25.773
” So it rained, rained, rained so much that
they had floods.

25:25.773 --> 25:35.653
So it should not be felt that there is a problem
with the nature.

25:35.653 --> 25:39.113
Nature is always with you, will always help
you, will be kind.

25:39.113 --> 25:43.453
But we have to be kind to ourselves, to our
nature.

25:43.453 --> 25:48.183
The nature that we have is that we are human
beings, we are not rakshasas, we are not devils,

25:48.183 --> 25:58.113
we can’t do all these things which are devilish,
which are nonsensical.

25:58.113 --> 26:09.143
And once we understand that we are saints,
we will know that we have to keep our saintly

26:09.143 --> 26:17.003
hood in such a manner that others can see
through our behavior.

26:17.003 --> 26:26.313
Nasik has another great heritage that many
saints came and did tapasyas, tapoguni.

26:26.313 --> 26:36.383
Nasik area is the tapoguni, is the land of
tapas, tapasyas and that’s why this is a

26:36.383 --> 26:40.003
very, very auspicious land.

26:40.003 --> 26:41.983
And here it is.

26:41.983 --> 27:01.763
You will see on your way to Dhulia, the Incarnation
of the Adi Shakti, which is the three powers

27:01.763 --> 27:29.173
of the Kundalini completely integrated, expressed
here as Sapta Shringi, meaning seven peaks.

27:29.173 --> 27:34.813
Now seven peaks are the seven centers in the
brain.

27:34.813 --> 27:44.923
And the Kundalini, though she has seven centers
to pass through, the governing pithas, the

27:44.923 --> 27:56.713
seats, are in the peak, in the head and so
Adi Shakti takes place in the Sahastrara.

27:56.713 --> 27:58.983
She incarnates in the Sahastrara.

27:58.983 --> 28:07.313
So we can say that this is the Sahastrara
of Maharashtra, or of the Universe in a way,

28:07.313 --> 28:16.273
though Himalaya is regarded as the real abode
of Sadashiva, which is on top.

28:16.273 --> 28:23.783
But the Sahastrara part, which is the limbic
area, should be here because we have three

28:23.783 --> 28:26.743
and a half coils settled here.

28:26.743 --> 28:30.893
That’s why the Kundalini of the Universe
is here.

28:30.893 --> 28:41.653
But as the Sapta Shringi has come out of Mother
Earth, this is the place where we can say

28:41.653 --> 28:42.993
resides the Sahastrara.

28:42.993 --> 28:53.583
Though the, on top is the Himalaya, and Himalaya
we can say is beyond Sahastrara, the three

28:53.583 --> 29:00.543
powers of the Goddess I don’t know if you’ll
be seeing all these, three expressed in three

29:00.543 --> 29:06.963
different places in the Maharashtra, but this
is the Ardha Matra, the half Matra, which

29:06.963 --> 29:10.123
is the Adi Shakti Herself.

29:10.123 --> 29:18.803
And this is what you see in this place and
I’m sure you’ll enjoy it tomorrow when

29:18.803 --> 29:21.983
you go on your way to Dhulia.

29:21.983 --> 29:31.973
With this understanding that in a subtle way
we are in a very important place, I hope you

29:31.973 --> 29:52.653
all will raise above mundane gross attention
into a subtler attention, into a higher attention and enjoy  the bliss of God.

29:52.653 --> 29:55.073
May God bless you.
