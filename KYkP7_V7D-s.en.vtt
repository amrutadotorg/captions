WEBVTT

00:52.788 --> 00:58.444
I hope you enjoyed yesterday’s puja
very much.

01:10.072 --> 01:16.695
Today I wanted to talk to you about
certain matters

01:16.896 --> 01:20.926
where people get quite confused.

01:23.147 --> 01:27.725
There are certain things we must understand
in Sahaja Yoga.

01:27.926 --> 01:33.814
First point there is no fundamentalism
in Sahaja Yoga.

01:34.060 --> 01:41.256
Nobody should use My words or say:
‘Mother said so’, nobody should.

01:41.457 --> 01:45.393
That is how all this hierarchies have been
built,

01:45.594 --> 01:49.985
in the churches, everywhere. Everybody
can read, everybody can find out.

01:50.186 --> 01:57.737
There is no way of controlling people
by saying: ‘Mother said so’.

01:58.245 --> 02:04.015
That shows that you are trying to use
My Words to tell people off.

02:04.216 --> 02:07.560
You are not in charge.

02:11.878 --> 02:21.667
If I say something in the program
of Sahaja Yogis,

02:21.868 --> 02:29.888
I say it because it is heart to heart talk
between My children and Myself, you see.

02:30.089 --> 02:33.727
And it should not be just sent over

02:33.928 --> 02:40.528
through your computers all over the world
without consulting, without censoring

02:40.729 --> 02:45.905
it by the leader. There’s no haste
in Sahaja Yoga.

02:46.106 --> 02:50.840
So that should not be done. Now this
I have said, definitely.

02:51.041 --> 02:55.696
Whatever I’ve said nobody remembers,
only they use My Name.

02:55.897 --> 03:04.066
Mother said so in 1970. In 1970 I never
spoke in English.

03:10.925 --> 03:21.539
So all this historical utterances should
not be used. We live in the present.

03:21.740 --> 03:26.864
That time maybe, the situation was such
I might have said something,

03:27.065 --> 03:30.982
but today the situation is different.

03:31.244 --> 03:35.721
Maybe because Sahaja Yogis were just
coming to Sahaja Yoga,

03:35.922 --> 03:40.436
maybe they needed some sort of a guideline.

03:40.637 --> 03:45.869
It’s a journey, first of all. It’s
a journey.

03:46.099 --> 03:52.402
You are passing, supposing passing through
a slope,

03:52.603 --> 03:56.103
then you have to use a different type
of method.

03:56.304 --> 04:01.999
Now you are walking on a plain land,

04:02.200 --> 04:07.918
then you don’t behave as if you are
climbing a mountain.

04:08.119 --> 04:13.567
So it’s a journey, journey of Sahaja Yoga
to our destination.

04:13.768 --> 04:18.720
The destination is that we have
to emancipate

04:18.921 --> 04:24.523
maximum number of human beings
into Sahaja Yoga.

04:27.404 --> 04:31.493
But that should not be taken over. I again
tell you,

04:31.694 --> 04:35.868
nobody should take over things from
the leaders.

04:36.069 --> 04:40.378
I have appointed the leaders just
to co-ordinate with you people,

04:40.579 --> 04:45.365
but you have a direct, always a direct
relationship with Me.

04:45.566 --> 04:55.303
So far all these people who believed in God
had no direct connection,

04:56.502 --> 05:01.963
but now you have: so why not use Me?

05:05.050 --> 05:09.098
And if there are leaders,

05:15.532 --> 05:19.081
you have to ask the leaders.

05:19.282 --> 05:25.146
Nobody should take things upon themselves
and start preaching people.

05:25.347 --> 05:32.909
We don’t like preaching. We have had enough
of it.

05:33.110 --> 05:36.355
There’s no need to preach other, if you
have to preach, preach yourself,

05:36.556 --> 05:39.177
but not to others.

05:39.378 --> 05:44.450
One has to understand that it’s a living
process.

05:47.331 --> 05:55.051
We can understand from a cell at the end
of a root.

05:55.252 --> 06:03.979
It has intelligence, it is completely
in control of itself

06:04.180 --> 06:11.032
and it has a direct connection with
the Divine Power.

06:11.233 --> 06:16.193
So it moves by itself, but the attention
is on the collective,

06:16.394 --> 06:21.267
collective means the tree. It moves in such
a direction,

06:21.468 --> 06:26.411
that there is no argument, there is no
quarrelling,

06:26.612 --> 06:32.311
in the sense there is no obstacle, moves.

06:32.993 --> 06:40.779
Now supposing, there is a big obstacle,

06:40.980 --> 06:46.592
like a stone, it goes round it, encircles
it many-a-times

06:46.793 --> 06:50.689
for the future tree that has to come.

06:55.395 --> 07:00.559
So from the past what do you get,

07:00.760 --> 07:04.377
is the relative idea as to where you have
reached.

07:04.578 --> 07:11.393
And from the future you have to know
how far you have to go.

07:13.727 --> 07:19.583
This is very important to understand because
these things creep into the western mind

07:19.784 --> 07:24.826
very easily. They don’t want to have direct
relations with Me.

07:25.027 --> 07:28.745
That’s how then you’ll start forming
groups.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.971
One person will stand up: ‘Mother says so.’
Finished.

07:33.172 --> 07:38.978
One tent is raised. Another one say:
‘Mother says so.’

07:39.179 --> 07:46.192
Somebody will use My tapes. Anything.
There’s no need at all for you

07:46.393 --> 07:51.224
to get to these things and listen to them.

07:51.430 --> 07:55.817
If they want to create something, they
should talk to Me directly,

07:56.018 --> 08:00.505
and not to do it themselves on their own,

08:00.706 --> 08:05.039
which is a very wrong attitude towards
Sahaja Yoga.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.437
So first of all, we must know it’s a living
process.

08:09.638 --> 08:15.916
You cannot put on it artificial types
of things,

08:16.117 --> 08:20.706
which will curb the growth of Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very important to understand.

08:20.907 --> 08:27.404
There where I find that people don’t
understand Sahaj Yoga.

08:27.605 --> 08:32.657
You cannot mould into any pattern.

08:32.858 --> 08:38.143
It moulds by itself. Works by itself.

08:39.582 --> 08:44.988
So we cannot have any hierarchy, never.

08:45.189 --> 08:52.989
These hierarchies ultimately become
a barrier between you and Me,

08:53.190 --> 08:59.852
which I don’t like. All the leaders are
told that whatever letters you get,

09:00.082 --> 09:03.750
whatever things you have, you should send
it over to Me.

09:03.951 --> 09:08.651
I would like to see them Myself. But
sometimes they do,

09:08.852 --> 09:12.664
some of the leaders, specially in Australia
I had a very bad experience.

09:12.865 --> 09:18.069
But now you have a very wise leader here,
and a very sensible person.

09:18.270 --> 09:20.024
I don’t think there’s anything wrong
with him.

09:20.225 --> 09:24.264
Only thing, I think he’s rather too mild
sometimes with some people.

09:24.465 --> 09:29.217
He should have told. Yesterday I had
to suffer so much because of two ladies,

09:29.431 --> 09:34.149
because he never told them how horrible
they were.

09:35.593 --> 09:39.941
So I had to absorb all their nonsense
quite a lot.

09:41.580 --> 09:47.151
Because if a leader is not mild, you’ll sit
on his head.

09:47.352 --> 09:51.898
If he’s little strict, you’ll get after
him.

09:52.517 --> 10:01.325
Only thing one has to realize, that
everything is a living process,

10:01.526 --> 10:09.989
and through some sort of a coordinator
Mother is trying

10:10.190 --> 10:16.045
to work out, in a more simpler manner.

10:16.246 --> 10:22.760
For example if everybody writes to Me
for a small little thing...

10:22.961 --> 10:26.123
I mean, they write for everything, I must
tell you.

10:26.324 --> 10:30.133
Absolutely something so useless
sometimes that I really laugh.

10:30.334 --> 10:37.262
There’s no need to ask Me like: ‘Mother,
we cannot get Indian spices here’.

10:46.251 --> 10:52.762
All these stupid things. Then second is
about the husbands or about the wives.

10:52.963 --> 10:58.005
Because you should not see those films
or those televisions,

10:58.206 --> 11:04.256
which if you see invariably show the fight
between husband and wife.

11:04.478 --> 11:07.289
So if you go on seeing that you will learn,
you’ll pick it up.

11:07.490 --> 11:12.238
It’s like a parrot, you know. You pick up
all the words which are to be said

11:12.439 --> 11:19.239
to your husband, harsh words, or to your
wife, and then you work it out that way.

11:19.620 --> 11:24.472
And so many questions could have been
easily solved.

11:24.673 --> 11:32.622
I think, to work out the marriage is only
question of a woman, not so much of man.

11:32.823 --> 11:37.418
Normally men don’t want to marry, normally.

11:38.129 --> 11:42.562
Though they have no responsibility, they
don’t have to produce children, anything.

11:42.763 --> 11:45.984
But still they don’t want to marry.

11:46.185 --> 11:52.300
They are sort of little bit afraid also,
in the west specially, not in India.

11:52.501 --> 11:59.226
In India men want to marry because they
get somebody who will spoil them,

12:00.694 --> 12:07.942
who will never answer them, listen to them,
be humble. So they want to have,

12:08.143 --> 12:11.388
see they marry. But here in the west I’ve
seen men don’t want to marry.

12:11.589 --> 12:17.663
One fellow I told him that you have to get
married, he disappeared for three days.

12:22.675 --> 12:28.579
So this marriage problem... we have to have
marriages.

12:28.780 --> 12:33.213
But this marriage problem comes when
women don’t know how to adjust,

12:33.414 --> 12:40.698
mainly, I must tell you. The first thing is
you have to really spoil your husbands.

12:41.428 --> 12:46.248
Actually, they should entirely depend on you
for everything.

12:46.449 --> 12:49.770
Then what will they do?

12:51.103 --> 12:55.655
But in a loving manner. Not in
an oppressive manner.

12:55.856 --> 13:00.075
Do not demand anything. Do not expect
anything.

13:00.276 --> 13:04.812
Just be gentle, kind, express your love.

13:05.013 --> 13:08.106
Then they get used to it, they can’t live
without it.

13:08.307 --> 13:11.913
These tricks should have told to you by
your parents, but they might have been

13:12.114 --> 13:18.280
the same as you are, so you don’t know
the tricks of the trade.

13:30.040 --> 13:36.708
After marriage we have to say: ‘We are,
we’. Shouldn’t say: ‘I’.

13:36.909 --> 13:43.332
And also understand, you see, men are
different from women. They are different.

13:43.578 --> 13:48.168
You are the preserver of the society.

13:48.565 --> 13:52.687
They are the creator, but you are
the preserver,

13:52.888 --> 13:57.853
and you have to have much more patience
and compassion which you have, no doubt.

13:58.054 --> 14:01.003
You must take to your feminine qualities

14:01.204 --> 14:06.239
and you’ll be amazed that you are shakti,
for men.

14:08.396 --> 14:13.966
You are the power for men. That’s why men
must respect women.

14:14.167 --> 14:18.559
If they don’t respect women, not their
romanticism and nonsense,

14:18.760 --> 14:24.426
but as personality. If they don’t respect,
then they suffer every way.

14:24.627 --> 14:27.474
Specially materially.

14:28.212 --> 14:33.908
Materially they suffer and also
reputation-wise.

14:35.594 --> 14:40.006
Some women are extremely demanding
and expecting too much.

14:40.207 --> 14:46.743
Perhaps maybe they see those pictures
of Romeo, Juliet and things like that.

14:49.749 --> 14:57.164
But if you see Romeo, Juliet, you will see
what Shakespeare wanted to communicate.

14:57.365 --> 15:01.988
He was an avadhuta. He wanted
to communicate that these are all

15:02.189 --> 15:05.752
futile enterprises.

15:06.726 --> 15:09.912
Both of them died.

15:10.150 --> 15:15.447
They could never enjoy companionship.

15:16.285 --> 15:20.395
We had so many problems like this
in England also,

15:20.596 --> 15:26.949
so I told them: ‘What books you read?’ Most
of them read books of romance, all right,

15:27.150 --> 15:33.013
but romance before marriage. There are no
books about romance after the marriage,

15:33.214 --> 15:36.184
can you imagine?!

15:37.183 --> 15:40.512
So naturally, there’s a problem.

15:40.713 --> 15:47.039
After marriage is quarrelling, before
marriage romance. So why marry?

15:50.972 --> 15:57.185
And when I said that man is the head
of the family,

15:57.386 --> 16:00.494
it doesn’t mean that man should dominate
a woman. Never.

16:00.695 --> 16:07.057
You interprete also, sometimes I think,
some of the brains are other way round.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.232
What I was saying that he is head
of the family.

16:10.433 --> 16:15.584
Supposing I say he is your leader. That
doesn’t mean that he should dominate you.

16:15.785 --> 16:22.327
If head of the family start dominating, if
the brain of the body starts dominating

16:22.528 --> 16:27.957
what will happen to this body? It’s stupid
to conclude like that.

16:28.158 --> 16:31.975
But you are the heart of the family.

16:32.188 --> 16:37.269
Brain can die, but heart dies the last.

16:38.324 --> 16:41.075
So try to understand, there should be
a complete integration

16:41.276 --> 16:44.491
between heart and brain.

16:45.437 --> 16:51.355
And children are the attention,
in the society of Sahaj Yoga.

16:51.561 --> 16:59.419
So here, how can you have such an idea
that if I say the head,

16:59.620 --> 17:03.976
then he dominates the heart. How can it?

17:04.177 --> 17:10.097
So they pick up few words from here and
there and use it for justifying

17:10.298 --> 17:14.573
their own weaknesses in Sahaj Yoga.

17:14.774 --> 17:18.912
But this kind of escape is not going
to help you to rise.

17:19.113 --> 17:23.721
You are going against yourself, is not
for your benevolence.

17:23.922 --> 17:30.836
What I’m telling you, is that if you try
to accept all these outdated ideas

17:31.037 --> 17:36.308
in Sahaj Yoga, you’ll go down, you’ll rot.
No use coming to Sahaj Yoga.

17:36.509 --> 17:43.641
We are fresh, we are new and we are living.

17:43.871 --> 17:49.235
We don’t accept these kind of ideas about
men or women.

17:49.436 --> 17:53.741
But when I said that man is the head
of the family,

17:53.942 --> 17:59.050
that doesn’t mean that you dominate your
wife and torture her.

18:00.478 --> 18:10.170
Nor does it mean that the leaders should
dominate, never.

18:10.371 --> 18:15.418
They should never dominate. They should
use their wisdom, their love, compassion

18:15.619 --> 18:19.656
and guide you in a proper way.

18:21.542 --> 18:26.570
I’ve received a letter which is very funny,
that one leader’s wife -

18:26.771 --> 18:33.987
not the leader - the wife,  forbid one of
the Sahaj Yoginis not to come to the house

18:34.188 --> 18:41.546
and to the program because I could not go
to her house. Can you imagine?

18:41.747 --> 18:46.731
This is absurd. Now if I tell her, she’ll
be more harsh on that person.

18:46.932 --> 18:52.776
But by doing that, she doesn’t know how
much she’s missing points in Sahaj Yoga.

18:52.977 --> 18:57.844
I mean, I’m a whimsical person. I can go
anywhere I feel like.

18:58.045 --> 19:01.439
But she should have taken the blame
upon herself,

19:01.640 --> 19:05.870
if she thinks I did not go to her house,
instead of on the another person.

19:06.071 --> 19:13.622
Also, there’s a thing that:

19:14.578 --> 19:17.479
‘This is my house’.

19:17.680 --> 19:23.244
This is the biggest nonsense. ‘Mother
should come to my house’.

19:23.421 --> 19:29.309
With Indian specially, it’s too much.
‘Please come to my house, Mother.

19:29.510 --> 19:35.258
Come and have dinner with me’. Who are you?

19:35.678 --> 19:41.714
You are a Sahaj Yogi. So your house is
Mine, you are Mine, everything is Mine.

19:41.915 --> 19:45.476
What is there to come to your house?
Then you separate.

19:45.677 --> 19:51.986
This is also an Indian mind, I must
confess. ‘My house’.

19:52.187 --> 19:56.377
This is nonsense, all your houses are Mine.

19:56.578 --> 20:01.095
If I go there, it doesn’t mean that I love
you more than anybody else.

20:01.296 --> 20:05.746
Doesn’t mean that. I have to go somewhere,
you know.

20:11.516 --> 20:15.517
Like somebody asked Me: ‘Why did you take
your birth in Christian religion?’

20:15.718 --> 20:19.649
I said: ‘I had to take My Birth somewhere’.

20:19.850 --> 20:23.545
But better was for Christians because
Christians are absolutely fundamentalists

20:23.746 --> 20:28.395
mentally. Mentally they are absolute
fundamentalists. Mentally.

20:28.596 --> 20:33.316
That’s more dangerous. Muslims you can make
them out they are fundamentalists

20:33.517 --> 20:37.251
because they do not have that finesse
about them.

20:37.452 --> 20:44.991
Openly they are fundamentalists, but
Christians are very great fundamentalists.

20:46.742 --> 20:51.707
But they go into somebody’s house now
is becoming a problem for Me.

20:51.908 --> 20:54.735
Because if I go to somebody’s house that
person gets the ego:

20:54.936 --> 20:58.355
‘Oh, She came to my house’.

21:01.278 --> 21:07.010
So again you are not to say that: ‘Mother,
this is my house.

21:07.211 --> 21:09.969
Mother, this is your house’. If I go there
well and good,

21:10.170 --> 21:14.559
if I don’t go there well and good, what
does it matter?

21:17.745 --> 21:23.212
Now again I tell you, nothing has to be
sent through your IBM or anything

21:23.413 --> 21:31.339
without the consultation and censoring
by the leader.

21:31.540 --> 21:36.209
It can land Me into great difficulties and
tomorrow I could be in jail.

21:36.410 --> 21:41.258
Why don’t you understand? I mean, you write
whatever you feel like.

21:42.592 --> 21:47.869
So this kind of irresponsible behaviour is,
I can’t understand,

21:48.070 --> 21:51.600
and things I never said also can be said.

21:51.801 --> 21:56.986
This shows immaturity and haste.

21:59.208 --> 22:06.597
Such things should be consulted, and use
your discretion. Main thing is discretion.

22:06.798 --> 22:15.505
What you need to consult your leader
which are vital, important.

22:17.033 --> 22:24.033
Specially things which are written down
and published, things which circulate,

22:24.234 --> 22:29.644
is extremely important to be seen by
the leaders.

22:29.845 --> 22:35.582
There is no hurry about it. Any book
written,

22:36.300 --> 22:39.751
any tapes to be released, anything,

22:39.952 --> 22:47.144
should be done with the complete consent
and understanding of the leader.

22:47.345 --> 22:51.430
I would say, the leader must sign those
papers.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.702
Then I can hold him responsible.

22:54.903 --> 23:01.451
But if you are arbitrary and start doing
things, then it could be dangerous.

23:01.652 --> 23:05.432
Simple things I’ll tell you what,
they asked Me: ‘Mother,

23:05.633 --> 23:09.623
what do you think of starting a Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma in Melbourne?’

23:09.824 --> 23:14.721
I said: ‘All right’. I didn’t know that
it’s going to be an association.

23:14.922 --> 23:16.839
There is going to be an election and all,
nothing.

23:17.040 --> 23:22.385
Just I said: ‘All right, just to start is
all right’.

23:22.663 --> 23:25.352
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is everywhere,

23:25.553 --> 23:31.482
but they don’t have any association,
nothing. It’s just a kind of a society,

23:31.683 --> 23:36.390
which is just spreading Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma.

23:39.016 --> 23:44.859
There is no sort of a, any organization
about it.

23:45.060 --> 23:51.084
We only have Trust, and we don’t want
to have any electioning or all that.

23:51.285 --> 24:00.111
Again if some wrong type of people get in,
then Sahaja Yoga will be ousted completely.

24:00.876 --> 24:03.202
So you can only have Trust,

24:03.403 --> 24:07.658
and if you want to do something else
you can form it separately,

24:07.859 --> 24:15.605
but it should not be Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma or Sahaj Yoga. Nothing doing.

24:17.167 --> 24:21.001
Because I said: ‘Yes’ that doesn’t
mean that you should go that far

24:21.202 --> 24:28.575
with forming this, that association, and
all that. It’s a news to Me.

24:31.991 --> 24:38.812
All right, whatever has been done, has to
be rectified. Absolutely to be rectified.

24:39.013 --> 24:46.707
And we have to bring it down to a proper
level, and should be there people,

24:47.160 --> 24:55.182
who should be elected as good people
who are in Sahaj Yoga,

24:55.563 --> 25:00.759
who have so far have been doing everything
in a straightforward manner

25:00.960 --> 25:07.070
and who have been very very sensible
about it.

25:10.157 --> 25:17.990
There’s also a suggestion that we should
project ourselves to outside things.

25:19.228 --> 25:27.079
If it means that we have to go to other
organizations, is wrong.

25:27.451 --> 25:30.002
All these organizations are dead
organizations,

25:30.203 --> 25:35.229
they are not living organizations. But if
they want to come to us, all right.

25:35.430 --> 25:38.946
But we should not go and break our heads
with them,

25:39.122 --> 25:45.508
because you’ll land up not only with
opposition, but you will catch from them,

25:45.709 --> 25:49.871
negativity. Try to understand.

25:50.371 --> 25:56.922
We don’t have to grow that fast that we get
all the lunatics in Sahaj Yoga.

25:57.123 --> 26:05.406
We have to be very careful. You can only
have Sahaja Yogis who are

26:06.413 --> 26:11.006
seekers, who are honest, who are humble,

26:11.207 --> 26:17.265
who do not want any money or power,
out of Sahaj Yoga.

26:18.434 --> 26:21.847
It will grow. It has grown, just imagine.

26:22.048 --> 26:27.163
Two people came from Australia and see how
many are there.

26:27.364 --> 26:35.111
It will definitely grow, no doubt, but do
not try to organize it.

26:36.487 --> 26:46.035
You cannot organize. Once you start
organizing, then the growth can be stunted.

26:46.607 --> 26:53.188
Like you have seen bonsai. Bonsai, when
they cut it and organize it,

26:53.365 --> 26:59.143
it becomes a small tree, but I haven’t seen
any tree which grows,

26:59.344 --> 27:03.789
if it is organized grows more, never.

27:06.935 --> 27:10.950
At the most you can nourish it, at the most
you can water it,

27:11.135 --> 27:15.470
at the most you can see the needs of this,

27:15.889 --> 27:18.856
but you cannot just

27:21.792 --> 27:26.228
make it grow more.

27:27.447 --> 27:32.372
All organizations cut the growth.

27:38.071 --> 27:42.833
In the beginning, it may look that by
organizing it, it has increased.

27:43.034 --> 27:49.951
We can say Christianity, what is this?
Like a pumpkin, has no meaning.

27:50.519 --> 27:55.734
Absolutely empty hollow nonsense. Like
Islam. Another nonsense.

27:56.011 --> 28:02.248
I mean they admit that Islam is different
from Muslims.

28:04.354 --> 28:10.406
It is being admitted now. What is Buddhism?
Another nonsense.

28:10.607 --> 28:15.564
So this kind of an artificial growth if you
want, you can take to artificial methods.

28:15.765 --> 28:21.758
We really want substantial people,
substantial dharma,

28:21.959 --> 28:25.243
innate within ourselves.

28:25.444 --> 28:30.849
We don’t have to take to these artificial
things.

28:31.539 --> 28:36.847
We are using lots of artificial manure now,
and people are revolting against it

28:37.048 --> 28:42.598
because they think that all these
artificial things are harmful to us.

28:42.884 --> 28:48.152
So allow it to work out through the grace
of this Divine Power

28:48.353 --> 28:52.975
in a more natural manner than putting
artificial organizations,

28:53.176 --> 28:55.846
artificial this and that.

28:56.047 --> 28:59.008
I think, some of you must have been
to Harvard or something

28:59.209 --> 29:03.925
to learn how to grow the business, and
that’s how you try to grow,

29:04.126 --> 29:08.110
but ultimately comes to recession.

29:15.044 --> 29:22.252
All those, who had education in Harvard,
are responsible all over the world,

29:22.453 --> 29:26.066
and all over the world there is recession.

29:26.359 --> 29:30.325
I think, this university should be closed
down.

29:54.561 --> 29:57.731
[Hindi: Shri Mataji says something about
the glass.]

29:57.932 --> 30:03.915
So now, regarding your children.

30:05.335 --> 30:14.275
I have been really studying the nature
of western children.

30:14.982 --> 30:18.727
Now the nature of western children is,

30:18.964 --> 30:24.277
that their attention is never on the right
things.

30:29.278 --> 30:32.525
Not on studies.

30:34.517 --> 30:37.769
I should say, not at all on studies.

30:37.970 --> 30:43.746
Now, on food yes.

30:43.947 --> 30:48.991
Like in England they asked for baked
beans in the morning.

30:49.192 --> 30:54.801
Now these horrible tinned baked beans,
which you have been giving to them,

30:55.002 --> 31:00.876
are not at all suitable for Indian climate
and they are no good.

31:01.077 --> 31:05.381
You see, if you see a western health
of a person,

31:05.582 --> 31:08.871
I mean, when you go to India you get
diarrhea.

31:09.072 --> 31:13.085
You cannot stand heat, you cannot stand
cold,

31:13.286 --> 31:21.858
anything that changes, you feel so much
the sickness.

31:22.059 --> 31:28.986
Apart from that, all the time you are
tired. You must introspect.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.947
Little work you’ll do and you are tired.

31:32.148 --> 31:36.548
I mean, you see in the films or anywhere
I’ve seen, even in the television,

31:36.749 --> 31:39.225
they’ll come and sit down, huhh.

31:39.426 --> 31:44.729
What work have they done, God knows.
All the time, huhh.

31:44.930 --> 31:50.238
What is the reason? The reason is to think
too much.

31:50.439 --> 31:52.620
Same with your marriages.

31:52.821 --> 31:55.742
You start thinking: ‘What are my
priorities, what should I do?

31:55.943 --> 32:00.923
Start analyzing. Just do it what you want
to do.

32:01.124 --> 32:13.423
This thinking too much is responsible
for your susceptibility to diseases.

32:13.682 --> 32:19.824
Of course, Mooladhara is one of the most
important chakra, no doubt.

32:20.025 --> 32:24.451
If the Mooladhara is weak, you can catch
any disease,

32:24.652 --> 32:33.310
for example: cancer, aids, schizophrenia,
yuppies disease,

32:33.511 --> 32:40.592
also the secret diseases, herpes and all
these things are very common in the west.

32:40.793 --> 32:47.684
But not in India, very few, because of
a strong Mooladhara.

32:47.885 --> 32:54.550
So now, first problem is how to strengthen
your Mooladhara?

32:57.837 --> 33:05.421
The second one is the kind of food you are
eating here is not so fresh.

33:05.622 --> 33:11.614
Try to eat fresh food. At least
in Australia you can get it,

33:13.416 --> 33:17.708
as far as possible. Take to more
carbohydrates,

33:17.909 --> 33:22.840
if you are thinking too much, best is
to take to carbohydrates.

33:22.986 --> 33:26.152
You are so much worried about putting on
weight

33:26.353 --> 33:32.551
or this thing. I don’t know why you want
to be skinny. What is the need?

33:33.822 --> 33:39.746
On the contrary, a person who has little
plumpness, absorbs vibrations much better.

33:39.947 --> 33:48.431
But do you know that vibrations sit on the
fat? Medhastitha - they sit on the fat.

33:48.632 --> 33:52.015
And that’s why they go on the nerves

33:52.216 --> 33:58.366
because nerve is made of fat. Your brain
is also made of fat.

33:58.885 --> 34:05.174
So this new idea of having mosquitoes
around...

34:07.350 --> 34:09.398
Sometimes, you know, I get frightened
in a way,

34:09.599 --> 34:14.826
I think, next moment that person is going
to fall on the ground.

34:17.190 --> 34:21.884
So whatever is pumped into your head,
you accept.

34:22.085 --> 34:30.509
That’s why the entrepreneurs are definitely
controlling you. You have no idea!

34:32.176 --> 34:35.037
Because we don’t have that wisdom to see.

34:35.238 --> 34:40.900
Now they said: ‘All right, you shouldn’t
put any oil in your head, all right?

34:41.069 --> 34:48.136
Never put any oil.’ So you become bald.
So they can sell wigs.

34:52.001 --> 34:58.231
All such things are there. You can put oil
before,

34:58.432 --> 35:02.116
previous night, just to make your hair

35:02.317 --> 35:07.798
grow properly, you must give them
nourishment. Why do you starve them?

35:09.859 --> 35:12.943
What’s wrong with oil I just don’t
understand?

35:13.144 --> 35:17.254
You must massage your body also with oil.
It’s very important.

35:17.455 --> 35:26.441
Sometimes, Saturday if you use oil
to massage your body, is a very good idea.

35:27.028 --> 35:31.763
Also massage your head, you must look
after yourself.

35:32.244 --> 35:35.108
But just because there’s a fashion not
to put oil,

35:35.309 --> 35:39.702
so you just not have any oil anywhere near.

35:40.189 --> 35:43.841
They all used to put oil if you see films
about say

35:44.026 --> 35:46.372
thirty years back, they were all nicely…

35:46.573 --> 35:50.771
Nobody had dry hair, all shining nice hair.

35:50.940 --> 35:55.194
They were supposed to be quite
good-looking.

35:55.551 --> 35:58.164
And this bhootish type of hair then,
when you have,

35:58.365 --> 36:03.984
all the bhoots will take over because
they’ll think: ‘This is the head for me’.

36:09.657 --> 36:16.491
So try to understand what is good for your
body,

36:17.824 --> 36:24.074
and what you should do. Massaging your body
is a very good thing.

36:24.275 --> 36:29.054
I think, without oil I cannot exist,
really.

36:29.255 --> 36:35.094
Because My work is on Sahasrara and if
I starve My Hair,

36:35.295 --> 36:41.309
either I’ll become completely bald or mad;
one of the two.

36:41.510 --> 36:47.550
It’s very soothing to massage your hair,
very soothing for your nerves, everything,

36:47.751 --> 36:50.336
and you are realized souls, there’s
vibrations flowing.

36:50.537 --> 36:54.072
You should massage your head nicely.

36:54.273 --> 37:02.000
Take about an hour, on a Saturday. Saturday
is the day of shani, is the day of Saturn,

37:02.201 --> 37:07.965
the day of Shri Krishna. He is so fond
of butter and oil.

37:10.861 --> 37:14.292
All these small small things should be
understood.

37:14.453 --> 37:19.113
Also you people are very fond of sun, I can
understand that.

37:19.314 --> 37:25.063
But I don’t know why in Australia you are
so fond of sun, when it is so much?

37:25.654 --> 37:31.791
But because it’s a fashion in the west,
we are all going to the sun, to the sea

37:31.992 --> 37:36.802
and spoiling your skin. Your skin cannot
have the glow,

37:37.003 --> 37:42.541
while you see, if you do not

37:44.326 --> 37:47.893
use sun bathing as some sort of
a treatment.

37:48.094 --> 37:53.262
It’s all right, there’s lot of sun, you can
move about.

37:54.022 --> 37:58.760
Indians used to wonder about the English,
and there was a saying

37:58.961 --> 38:03.340
that an Englishman and a mad dog
in the sun.

38:03.541 --> 38:06.843
Even a sane dog won’t go.

38:12.106 --> 38:14.936
All such things should be understood.

38:15.137 --> 38:21.296
Personal hygiene also has to be seen.
Use lot of water to wash your hands,

38:21.497 --> 38:28.002
and when you are using toilets, water
should be used every time. Very important.

38:28.203 --> 38:32.423
Otherwise, your Mooladhara can never be
all right.

38:33.599 --> 38:39.730
Your children, I’m surprised, they don’t
want to brush their teeth.

38:41.010 --> 38:44.419
And if you tell them you have to brush,
they start crying.

38:44.620 --> 38:47.949
If you tell them you have to have a bath,
they start crying. Imagine, in that

38:48.150 --> 38:53.841
sweltering heat of India, they don’t want
to have a bath and they smell.

38:54.042 --> 38:59.902
But when you tell them: ‘Our parents also
smell like that’.

39:00.310 --> 39:03.427
Their mouths smell.

39:03.792 --> 39:07.723
In India at least twice we must brush,

39:07.924 --> 39:12.411
once in the morning, once in the evening.
Minimum.

39:12.612 --> 39:17.603
Evening time, we all brush our teeth,
in India.

39:19.214 --> 39:21.861
Is very important.

39:22.166 --> 39:25.646
Now these are such small small things,
which I think,

39:25.847 --> 39:30.211
our culture in India has already taught us
long time back.

39:30.412 --> 39:33.210
I mean we don’t have to tell anyone like
that, they’ll say, "What are you telling us

39:33.411 --> 39:38.862
this nonsense". But they should be fond
of doing this,

39:39.063 --> 39:44.308
so the way is that when your children are
growing, you take them in the bathroom,

39:44.509 --> 39:48.739
make a fun out of it: 'Now let’s see,
we’ll brush our teeth.

39:48.940 --> 39:52.650
You brush your teeth I’ll brush my teeth.
Now see whose are whiter', like that.

39:52.851 --> 40:01.270
Make a fun out of it. You are the one who
can teach them good hygiene. Then bathing.

40:01.698 --> 40:09.075
All these little little things are very
important for you and for your children.

40:09.228 --> 40:13.514
So the hygiene part is very poor, personal
hygiene.

40:13.715 --> 40:17.735
Of course, your house is very very clean,
absolutely.

40:17.936 --> 40:21.185
If anything falls on the carpet,
immediately you’ll pick it up,

40:21.386 --> 40:23.957
because this carpet maybe sold later on.

40:24.158 --> 40:27.806
Whatever is saleable, you look after.

40:28.007 --> 40:32.038
Now your teeth also can be saleable,

40:32.257 --> 40:38.341
you need not neglect them, but you will
not be careful.

40:38.542 --> 40:42.318
Whatever is saleable, you’re very careful,
your house - very careful,

40:42.519 --> 40:48.315
your carpets - very careful, but whatever
is not saleable,

40:48.678 --> 40:51.713
is not worth anything.

40:51.914 --> 40:58.850
Now in Sahaj Yoga, we should know that
nothing is saleable.

40:59.533 --> 41:04.996
Whatever we have and own, we’ll keep it
with ourself or give it to our children,

41:05.197 --> 41:09.975
or give it as presents to others. You are
not going to sell anything.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.523
Everybody is a seller.

41:14.609 --> 41:18.845
House is to be sold, very particular about
the house.

41:19.046 --> 41:23.038
If something goes wrong, you’ll shout
at children. We were surprised

41:23.239 --> 41:26.293
that these children were more careful about

41:26.494 --> 41:31.924
nonsensical things like carpets than their
teeth.

41:32.511 --> 41:35.691
Something fell down on the carpet,
immediately they all rushed

41:35.892 --> 41:39.695
and cleaned the carpet so we started
wondering what’s the matter with them.

41:39.896 --> 41:45.210
That’s not their job. That’s the training
they have.

41:46.176 --> 41:49.925
Whatever is saleable, they try to put right.

41:50.126 --> 41:53.052
So we must change our mind and say that:

41:53.253 --> 41:55.825
‘Whatever we own, we are not going
to sell it,’

41:56.026 --> 42:01.014
or sometimes you have to sell the house,
all right, but it’s not so important.

42:01.215 --> 42:03.241
In any way,

42:03.621 --> 42:08.488
whether the house is clean or dirty, you’ll
fetch the same price, that’s My experience.

42:08.689 --> 42:13.095
Whether you decorate or not, on the
contrary, undecorated houses they like,

42:13.296 --> 42:16.748
because of their ego, very surprising.

42:16.962 --> 42:22.336
We had bought a house, in Hounslow,

42:22.537 --> 42:26.516
and one side belonged to one of
the Sahaja Yoginis, one side to Me.

42:26.717 --> 42:29.033
I had no time to decorate or anything,

42:29.234 --> 42:32.485
and she, poor thing, spent so much money
to decorate it and all that,

42:32.686 --> 42:37.167
and some people lived also. Of course, she
made little money out of it, whatever it is.

42:37.368 --> 42:41.452
But My house sold for a higher price
than hers.

42:41.653 --> 42:46.644
Why? They said: ‘It’s already done, we
can’t do anything about it’.

42:48.233 --> 42:57.745
So also the ego is there, that we should
be able to do something, in the house.

42:58.481 --> 43:02.707
And thus, it doesn’t make difference.

43:02.908 --> 43:06.645
In any way, they don’t pay for your carpets
and don't pay for your thing.

43:06.846 --> 43:14.290
But people are so particular about their
furniture, about everything.

43:17.389 --> 43:21.870
So now, this is what is materialism.

43:26.913 --> 43:30.469
Is absolute materialism,

43:31.635 --> 43:37.648
that we try to get things just for selling
off.

43:40.793 --> 43:49.647
On the contrary, we have to look out, what
are the beautiful things made by hand.

43:50.890 --> 43:56.145
What can we have, whatever is made by hand
by people.

43:56.346 --> 44:04.584
Can have few, and that can be given
to your children, to the progeny.

44:06.952 --> 44:12.650
Also sometimes, the idea of antique…

44:12.851 --> 44:19.155
Who is this child? Please take away.
Who is the child? Who is the child crying?

44:21.052 --> 44:27.484
You must find out why the child is crying
in My Program. Must be something wrong.

44:27.757 --> 44:32.790
Must be some baddha. If a child cries
in My Presence

44:32.991 --> 44:39.755
or is afraid, that means there’s some sort
of a baddha, which you should try to remove.

44:41.625 --> 44:46.090
So now, we have to change our attitude
towards ourselves.

44:46.291 --> 44:50.219
We are specially blessed people, we have
to look after our body,

44:50.420 --> 44:53.447
look after our children. We have to look
after things,

44:53.648 --> 45:00.527
which are of much greater importance than
material things, that is the spirit.

45:00.728 --> 45:02.953
So ultimately, we come to the point

45:03.154 --> 45:07.869
that the spirit which has given us all
this beauty,

45:08.111 --> 45:12.388
which has given us such moonlight
in our life,

45:12.589 --> 45:17.073
such sunshine in our work,

45:17.834 --> 45:21.479
she has made us so sweet.

45:22.915 --> 45:32.611
After all, what we have done for the spirit
to satisfy it, to enjoy it?

45:32.812 --> 45:37.568
So the most important thing for us
is our spirit,

45:37.769 --> 45:41.542
and we should seek the comfort of
the spirit.

45:41.776 --> 45:46.582
The more you think about your spirit,
the deeper you’ll go,

45:46.783 --> 45:52.031
and the joy you’ll get will be also very
deep, and you’ll settle down,

45:52.232 --> 45:56.468
very nicely embedded in spirituality.

45:56.730 --> 46:06.727
So you have to, all the time think: ‘Am I
doing this for my spiritual growth?’

46:08.519 --> 46:12.649
I mean, in a place like England people get
up at four o’clock to meditate.

46:12.850 --> 46:16.314
Nothing doing. This time there was
a big number.

46:16.515 --> 46:20.632
I told so many English that, 'You have been
coming every time to Ganapatipule.

46:20.833 --> 46:23.910
Can you not reduce your number?' They felt
very sad.

46:24.111 --> 46:26.684
‘Mother, we need it. We have to.’

46:26.885 --> 46:29.825
But I said: ‘This time you can avoid, there
are so many people coming.

46:30.026 --> 46:32.326
If we have too many people...’, because
about

46:32.527 --> 46:35.910
hundred and fifty people came from other
countries, you see,

46:36.111 --> 46:41.819
who were not even paying and who were not
such Sahaja Yogis.

46:42.020 --> 46:45.146
So I said, 'We have to work it out with
them'.

46:45.347 --> 46:48.925
They said: ‘Mother, but we can’t help it.

46:49.126 --> 46:53.933
We have to be there. We can’t do without
it.’

46:55.894 --> 47:00.344
So this kind of understanding, I’m so happy
that you all

47:00.545 --> 47:08.297
managed to come all this way here and you
are settled so well.

47:08.498 --> 47:16.900
You are living in tents and enjoying this
discomfort because you have got

47:17.101 --> 47:22.600
the comfort of your heart, comfort of your
spirit.

47:22.801 --> 47:27.487
So as it is we have suddenly come up,
very high up,

47:27.688 --> 47:30.712
and whatever I said yesterday was not
in any way

47:30.913 --> 47:34.414
to pamper your vanity but the truth. I just
told you the truth.

47:34.615 --> 47:41.780
It’s truth for at least ninety-five percent
people of Sahaj Yoga.

47:41.981 --> 47:47.590
But they should also go deeper and deeper
and enjoy themselves

47:47.791 --> 47:55.122
and enjoy the collectivity. Now in general,
I can talk to you about things,

47:55.323 --> 48:01.283
that firstly that you have to ask your
leaders if you have to do

48:01.484 --> 48:08.624
anything extraordinary. Now is your
discretion.

48:14.675 --> 48:19.784
And the last but not the least is this:
all the leaders complain

48:19.985 --> 48:26.001
that no one wants to pay any money
whatsoever for Sahaj Yoga.

48:26.202 --> 48:30.345
Now you see, actually, as you know that,

48:30.546 --> 48:36.575
whatever money you give Me for pujas,
I buy silver for you,

48:36.776 --> 48:46.567
and you are given the equal amount of
silver as one would give to Europeans.

48:47.427 --> 48:51.796
But as far as the puja money is concerned,

48:51.997 --> 48:55.284
it’s very low. First they used to just give
Me one dollar.

48:55.485 --> 49:00.014
Of course, that was all in coins, which
I have brought it back,

49:00.215 --> 49:07.520
but otherwise whatever is there, is… I’m
not using it for Myself, I don’t need it.

49:07.721 --> 49:14.525
I should normally, because it’s given to Me,
but I just thought, that instead of that,

49:14.726 --> 49:20.052
if I give you silver, you will have silver
for puja, which is very important,

49:20.253 --> 49:24.663
and that it will be very auspicious.

49:28.326 --> 49:36.353
But the way people want to pay is rather
reluctant.

49:36.734 --> 49:41.291
I agree that you people are now running
into problem about money,

49:41.492 --> 49:44.667
but maybe one of the reasons may be that.

49:44.868 --> 49:50.568
Do you know you pay the lowest in the whole
world? No one pays so low as that.

49:50.769 --> 49:58.291
At least, they pay twenty-one and eleven,
even in India. Minimum.

49:58.492 --> 50:02.642
So whatever it is, whatever suits you,
I’m not going to say anything.

50:02.843 --> 50:06.520
Whether you collect less or more, I’m going
to give you the silver

50:06.721 --> 50:10.349
because you are so many people, and I have
to do that.

50:10.550 --> 50:16.918
I always put the maximum amount between
you and Europe.

50:17.119 --> 50:25.743
You are also a continent, as Europe is, but
one has to understand, that at least,

50:26.558 --> 50:30.623
we should really think of doing something
for Sahaj Yoga.

50:30.824 --> 50:34.202
What can we do for Sahaj Yoga?

50:34.957 --> 50:40.334
As you know very well, that I’ve used My
husband’s money quite a lot,

50:40.535 --> 50:44.432
and again I’m going to work out something
in Australia,

50:44.633 --> 50:51.406
because I think in Australia it will be
very good for people,

50:51.841 --> 50:57.024
and I can involve My money with them.
But despite all that,

50:57.225 --> 51:01.480
people don’t understand that why My husband
allows Me to do that,

51:01.681 --> 51:06.826
because he knows it gives him all
the blessings.

51:07.824 --> 51:12.846
He told Me many-a-times, he told group
of people, he told openly to Sahaj Yogis

51:13.029 --> 51:21.663
that: 'All these awards I’ve got because
of my Wife, but She is working for God'.

51:21.840 --> 51:26.357
But I wanted to say also you donated a lot
of money.

51:27.142 --> 51:32.815
It’s the generosity and if you donate, then
you get it also from another thing.

51:33.016 --> 51:39.609
But I don’t want it for My Personal thing
at all, but is a sign of your generosity.

51:39.810 --> 51:42.876
That is a common thing from all
the leaders...

51:43.077 --> 51:47.828
Melbourne leader says that nobody wants
to pay.

51:48.114 --> 51:50.850
Only they want to take advantage of Sahaja
Yoga.

51:51.051 --> 51:56.754
This is not a very good thing from Lakshmi
point of view.

51:56.955 --> 52:04.508
Also one has to understand that once you
joined Sahaj Yoga,

52:04.709 --> 52:09.822
whether you pay or not pay or anything,
you think you are a liability,

52:10.023 --> 52:14.937
that’s very wrong also. For every small
thing they want help.

52:15.138 --> 52:18.702
Of course, they are to be helped. We try
to help people who are,

52:18.903 --> 52:23.060
who haven’t got money or who are… but they
become sort of liabilities

52:23.261 --> 52:28.558
and then they expect so much from other
Sahaj Yogis,

52:28.759 --> 52:33.805
or from Me also, that one can’t understand,
I mean.

52:34.006 --> 52:38.876
You marry someone, then that person becomes
a headache:

52:39.077 --> 52:44.031
letters after letters, telephones after
telephones.

52:45.455 --> 52:52.372
Is not proper. Of course, some child is
sick, all right, you can inform Me.

52:52.573 --> 52:58.505
But a child is hot-tempered, is
misbehaving, is on My Head.

52:58.706 --> 53:04.433
Maybe you have been hot-tempered, maybe
you are fighting with your wife

53:04.634 --> 53:08.680
or your wife is fighting with you, may be
that. Why not correct that part?

53:08.881 --> 53:13.754
Even the smallest thing they think, should
be done by Sahaja Yoga.

53:13.955 --> 53:18.185
Sahaja Yoga must look after this thing,
Sahaja Yoga must do that.

53:18.386 --> 53:22.727
So one should understand that to you Sahaja
Yoga as a liability,

53:22.928 --> 53:26.450
not you are a liability to Sahaja Yoga.

53:26.651 --> 53:31.856
That’s the best attitude. Of course,
in a way you are a liability.

53:32.057 --> 53:35.473
But what should be your attitude? Now
you’re matured enough.

53:35.674 --> 53:40.204
When the son grows up and matures, then
he looks after the parents.

53:40.405 --> 53:43.232
In the same way, you have to look after
the Sahaja Yoga,

53:43.433 --> 53:52.010
than Sahaja Yoga looking after you all the
time and pestering Sahaja Yogis about it.

53:53.209 --> 53:59.157
This has to be understood very well, that
Sahaja Yoga is not liable for you.

53:59.338 --> 54:03.458
You are liable for Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga
has given you so much.

54:03.634 --> 54:09.295
God has done so much for you, what have
we done for God? Always think like that.

54:09.496 --> 54:15.153
If you start thinking like that, the more
work you put in for Sahaja Yoga,

54:15.354 --> 54:20.573
the more you exert your mind for Sahaja
Yoga,

54:20.893 --> 54:27.892
in a proper living, balanced manner,
the more you are helped,

54:28.093 --> 54:34.816
the more you grow, the more you enjoy.
It’s like that.

54:37.899 --> 54:42.784
And so, today’s lecture is for all of you
in a way,

54:42.985 --> 54:46.676
because I don’t know what applies to whom.
But you should not put it on somebody else,

54:46.877 --> 54:49.899
but take it for yourself

54:50.724 --> 54:59.073
that we are not going to be liabilities
on Sahaja Yoga, but a support.

55:00.304 --> 55:03.668
We have to look after Sahaja Yoga,

55:05.955 --> 55:10.343
which is a very, very beautiful attitude.
That’s My attitude is.

55:10.544 --> 55:13.704
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga at all.

55:14.418 --> 55:18.836
Not at all. Why do I need? I don’t have
to do Sahaja Yoga.

55:19.954 --> 55:24.208
But I am worried about Sahaja Yoga, about
Sahaja Yogis.

55:24.385 --> 55:27.125
To Me they are all My liabilities. I have
to look after them,

55:27.326 --> 55:31.627
I have to worry about them, I have to listen
to them. I receive letters and all that.

55:31.828 --> 55:37.824
I mean, this kind of work if somebody has
to do, nobody would accept.

55:39.080 --> 55:47.142
In every way I have to support, because
My Spirit gets satisfied.

55:48.268 --> 55:50.848
It’s for the satisfaction, My own
satisfaction,

55:51.017 --> 55:54.829
I’m not doing for your satisfaction,
I’m doing for My own satisfaction.

55:55.030 --> 55:57.962
Is selfishness.

55:58.986 --> 56:03.904
So when you reach that selfhood, you will
understand what this self needs

56:04.105 --> 56:08.559
and you’ll put your mind to it and you’ll
be surprised that when you start doing

56:08.760 --> 56:18.579
something for others, for Sahaja Yoga,
it’s very much rewarding

56:18.951 --> 56:23.662
and very much like a prayer.

56:24.526 --> 56:27.791
Everything is a prayer in Sahaja Yoga.

56:27.992 --> 56:33.670
Whatever you do for Sahaja Yoga is
a prayer, is a rapport.

56:33.889 --> 56:40.720
Is the oneness with God. Is what we can
call the worship.

56:41.640 --> 56:43.865
And once you start doing that,

56:44.066 --> 56:48.056
you’ll not bother as to who criticizes you,
what people say to you, nothing.

56:48.257 --> 56:55.141
But you’ll feel such relationship and
understanding.

56:58.117 --> 57:03.175
I’m sure, this Shiva Puja will definitely
establish you

57:03.336 --> 57:07.422
at a much higher level, I’m sure.

57:07.897 --> 57:11.748
And you will know where you are.

57:12.716 --> 57:17.481
I’m very happy about it, that a Shiva Puja
was arranged here.

57:17.682 --> 57:26.367
Once it was arranged in Europe. It was all
full of storms and snowfall, and everything.

57:26.568 --> 57:30.749
But so many came to Rome for the Shiva
Puja.

57:30.950 --> 57:35.728
They all asked Me: ‘Mother, we should have
one Shiva Puja.’ And the whole thing

57:35.929 --> 57:39.176
was so surprising, that people came from
Greece and everywhere,

57:39.377 --> 57:43.865
driving down, I don’t know. And there was
always report of snowfall is there,

57:44.042 --> 57:49.109
flood is there, and they were all there.

57:50.053 --> 57:56.520
And suddenly, I found a level had risen,

57:56.721 --> 58:01.451
because here we are in direct contact
with our spirit.

58:01.652 --> 58:04.287
Here we know about our spirit.

58:04.488 --> 58:10.605
We are obliged to our spirit what
it has done to us, we respect it.

58:10.806 --> 58:17.505
And that’s how I’ve seen the certain
change,

58:17.706 --> 58:22.750
and a very great height suddenly they
achieved.

58:22.951 --> 58:26.966
And I am sure, this will happen
to Australians.

58:27.167 --> 58:32.869
Now forget your small differences, fighting
for power,

58:33.070 --> 58:38.963
fighting for money nonsense. Try to be
all right.

58:39.164 --> 58:43.551
There are some people who got caught up,
because of this nonsense in Melbourne.

58:43.744 --> 58:49.107
They should all cleanse themselves out,
put themselves right

58:49.308 --> 58:53.170
and look after themselves. All My blessings
with you.

58:53.371 --> 58:56.010
May God bless you.

59:06.130 --> 59:08.889
[Hindi: If you all want to sing some songs
and then we will move.]

59:09.090 --> 59:15.104
So I’ll be bidding you farewell.
[Hindi: Did you bring the gifts?]

59:16.238 --> 59:19.759
At the parting I want to give

59:20.671 --> 59:27.032
something small for all the leaders, because
I want them to write the diary.

59:35.307 --> 59:39.162
So it is for other leaders, apart from

59:39.363 --> 59:46.002
our main leader, the National leader.
This is for everyone.

59:46.240 --> 59:50.513
Yogi: John Henshaw, Melbourne.

01:00:11.853 --> 01:00:16.387
Are you all right, John? All right now,

01:00:16.588 --> 01:00:22.181
try to keep your blood pressure low
by not discussing,

01:00:22.382 --> 01:00:27.857
talking to all nonsense, all right?
And just put your right hand

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:32.926
towards the Photograph and you know
the right hand treatment.

01:00:33.127 --> 01:00:35.810
So may God bless you.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:45.907
Shri Mataji: Brian Bell. Yogi: Brian Bell.

01:01:02.246 --> 01:01:05.491
Yes. May God bless you.

01:01:10.495 --> 01:01:15.535
Yogi: (Inaudible name)

01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:28.250
May God bless you.

01:01:28.846 --> 01:01:31.227
Yogi: (Inaudible name)

01:01:41.827 --> 01:01:44.494
Yogi: John Fisher.

01:01:56.131 --> 01:02:02.134
Is only for the people where I visited
and also

01:02:04.859 --> 01:02:09.051
for the different states as you have.

01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:15.357
But you see, your Customs are so funny,
you’d better give them a bandhan,

01:02:15.558 --> 01:02:18.504
that I can’t bring any presents for all
of you.

01:02:18.705 --> 01:02:21.904
That’s the only thing I didn’t like about
Australia.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:27.135
Because they are very strict and really
funny people.

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:34.140
In every country presents are allowed
except in yours.

01:02:38.178 --> 01:02:40.104
So now... [Hindi: If you want to sing
anything?].

01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:43.278
Then we’ll have to go. I’ll have to go
back,

01:02:43.479 --> 01:02:46.302
going back to...[Hindi: What time is it?]

01:02:47.596 --> 01:02:51.271
I have to leave for Sydney now.

01:02:51.472 --> 01:02:54.871
[Hindi: Sing what pleases you.]

01:02:57.672 --> 01:03:01.509
Yogi: All the miusicians take their place
as quickly as possible.

01:03:06.629 --> 01:03:09.559
Yogini: (gives a photograph as a present)
Mother, please have it.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.205
Shri Mataji: Oh, the children are reflected
in it.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.159
It’s a beautiful photograph, I must say.

01:03:21.499 --> 01:03:26.944
I’m so happy with them. Thank you very
much, it’s beautiful.
