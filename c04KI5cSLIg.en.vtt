SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.660
CABELLA

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:11.659
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:33.390
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:48.529
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:52.680
you have achieved we have to see it.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:12.479
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:23.840
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:34.606
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.877
It’s established.

00:01:37.877 --> 00:01:43.297
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

00:01:43.297 --> 00:01:53.817
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

00:01:53.817 --> 00:02:01.657
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:08.057
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:18.507
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

00:02:18.507 --> 00:02:26.327
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:37.167
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:43.626
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:54.117
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

00:02:54.117 --> 00:03:07.567
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:21.346
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:23.817
also starts flowing with it.

00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:33.957
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

00:03:33.957 --> 00:03:44.317
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:47.207
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:54.527
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

00:03:54.527 --> 00:04:01.117
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

00:04:01.117 --> 00:04:07.107
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:13.367
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:21.726
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:24.207
go to them.

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:36.207
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

00:04:36.207 --> 00:04:40.527
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:48.937
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

00:04:48.937 --> 00:04:59.237
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:05.387
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

00:05:05.387 --> 00:05:15.857
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:25.916
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:29.617
No one can harm you.

00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:35.857
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:45.957
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

00:05:45.957 --> 00:05:54.027
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

00:05:54.027 --> 00:05:58.476
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:02.237
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:14.457
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:20.737
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:29.407
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:31.887
He is a religious man.

00:06:31.887 --> 00:06:36.667
He should also put stones on her.

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.967
But He was standing on truth.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:47.476
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

00:06:47.476 --> 00:06:49.397
that you stand on truth.

00:06:49.397 --> 00:06:59.767
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:09.027
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.977
to the left.

00:07:10.977 --> 00:07:22.376
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:27.416
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:32.717
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

00:07:32.717 --> 00:07:39.907
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:44.816
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

00:07:44.816 --> 00:07:50.907
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

00:07:50.907 --> 00:07:52.786
way do that way.

00:07:52.786 --> 00:07:59.777
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:10.607
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

00:08:10.607 --> 00:08:16.107
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

00:08:16.107 --> 00:08:28.006
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:32.006
religion even about Sahaj religion.

00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:39.937
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:43.937
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:53.537
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

00:08:53.537 --> 00:08:58.147
he is in that truth.

00:08:58.147 --> 00:09:06.147
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

00:09:06.147 --> 00:09:10.187
to all of you.

00:09:10.187 --> 00:09:15.977
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

00:09:15.977 --> 00:09:23.067
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:28.217
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:33.387
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:33.387 --> 00:09:44.407
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

00:09:44.407 --> 00:09:47.677
on truth or untruth.

00:09:47.677 --> 00:09:54.007
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

00:09:54.007 --> 00:10:01.347
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

00:10:01.347 --> 00:10:03.647
branches in the body.

00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:10.637
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:14.477
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

00:10:14.477 --> 00:10:28.337
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:31.587
we have taken.

00:10:31.587 --> 00:10:34.477
We have now become dharmic.

00:10:34.477 --> 00:10:37.007
What is the root of dharma?

00:10:37.007 --> 00:10:42.427
Why should we be dharmic?

00:10:42.427 --> 00:10:43.847
What is the need to be dharmic?

00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:49.307
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

00:10:49.307 --> 00:10:55.377
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

00:10:55.377 --> 00:11:03.457
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:06.977
enjoyments of these people.

00:11:06.977 --> 00:11:18.857
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

00:11:18.857 --> 00:11:20.927
standing on truth.

00:11:20.927 --> 00:11:27.277
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

00:11:27.277 --> 00:11:31.107
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:44.377
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

00:11:44.377 --> 00:11:46.327
even their language improves.

00:11:46.327 --> 00:11:57.067
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

00:11:57.067 --> 00:12:02.237
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

00:12:02.237 --> 00:12:07.397
This consciousness has to disappear.

00:12:07.397 --> 00:12:26.217
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

00:12:26.217 --> 00:12:28.837
is truth.

00:12:28.837 --> 00:12:35.487
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:39.507
As you know the pita of heart is here.

00:12:39.507 --> 00:12:48.667
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:55.197
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

00:12:55.197 --> 00:13:03.487
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

00:13:03.487 --> 00:13:09.457
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

00:13:09.457 --> 00:13:20.757
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:24.347
love, the pure love.

00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:33.087
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

00:13:33.087 --> 00:13:41.547
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

00:13:41.547 --> 00:13:55.787
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

00:13:55.787 --> 00:14:00.717
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:12.747
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

00:14:12.747 --> 00:14:18.187
- that’s the personality you have to become.

00:14:18.187 --> 00:14:26.967
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:33.857
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

00:14:33.857 --> 00:14:37.227
person.

00:14:37.227 --> 00:14:44.187
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

00:14:44.187 --> 00:14:45.187
things.

00:14:45.187 --> 00:14:56.387
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

00:14:56.387 --> 00:15:00.567
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:06.547
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

00:15:06.547 --> 00:15:09.277
here you are talking like this.

00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:18.157
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

00:15:18.157 --> 00:15:25.207
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

00:15:25.207 --> 00:15:34.507
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

00:15:34.507 --> 00:15:44.657
to say things by which they become one, united.

00:15:44.657 --> 00:15:52.277
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

00:15:52.277 --> 00:16:03.517
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:10.218
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

00:16:10.218 --> 00:16:20.597
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

00:16:20.597 --> 00:16:25.837
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

00:16:25.837 --> 00:16:36.437
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

00:16:36.437 --> 00:16:40.697
collective consciousness.

00:16:40.697 --> 00:16:44.027
Now people talk of peace.

00:16:44.027 --> 00:16:50.437
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

00:16:50.437 --> 00:17:01.736
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

00:17:01.736 --> 00:17:13.317
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

00:17:13.317 --> 00:17:14.317
fulfilling.

00:17:14.317 --> 00:17:24.387
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:33.947
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

00:17:33.947 --> 00:17:43.117
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

00:17:43.117 --> 00:17:51.827
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

00:17:51.827 --> 00:17:54.937
we can change this world.

00:17:54.937 --> 00:18:06.337
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

00:18:06.337 --> 00:18:12.537
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

00:18:12.537 --> 00:18:15.767
Why do you hate someone.

00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:22.497
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

00:18:22.497 --> 00:18:23.947
sake.

00:18:23.947 --> 00:18:31.417
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

00:18:31.417 --> 00:18:38.957
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

00:18:38.957 --> 00:18:45.477
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

00:18:45.477 --> 00:18:54.907
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

00:18:54.907 --> 00:18:58.347
This doesn’t stop.

00:18:58.347 --> 00:19:00.537
By dividing us what has happened?

00:19:00.537 --> 00:19:06.517
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

00:19:06.517 --> 00:19:12.417
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:13.687
this that.

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:18.277
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

00:19:18.277 --> 00:19:22.167
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

00:19:22.167 --> 00:19:31.807
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

00:19:31.807 --> 00:19:34.087
country being divided.

00:19:34.087 --> 00:19:43.187
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

00:19:43.187 --> 00:19:54.217
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

00:19:54.217 --> 00:20:02.757
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

00:20:02.757 --> 00:20:11.417
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:15.157
Why?

00:20:15.157 --> 00:20:20.897
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:24.057
separate houses?

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.817
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

00:20:26.817 --> 00:20:36.187
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

00:20:36.187 --> 00:20:37.287
houses.

00:20:37.287 --> 00:20:44.097
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

00:20:44.097 --> 00:20:52.807
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

00:20:52.807 --> 00:20:53.877
are catching.

00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:54.957
Isn’t it?

00:20:54.957 --> 00:20:59.187
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:20:59.187 --> 00:21:05.617
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

00:21:05.617 --> 00:21:06.617
understand.

00:21:06.617 --> 00:21:14.157
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

00:21:14.157 --> 00:21:17.847
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

00:21:17.847 --> 00:21:26.767
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:27.767
to do.

00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:35.687
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

00:21:35.687 --> 00:21:44.317
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

00:21:44.317 --> 00:21:50.897
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

00:21:50.897 --> 00:21:58.687
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

00:21:58.687 --> 00:21:59.687
that.

00:21:59.687 --> 00:22:05.377
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

00:22:05.377 --> 00:22:06.867
So there is nothing like that.

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:13.297
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

00:22:13.297 --> 00:22:16.637
who tries all kinds of tricks.

00:22:16.637 --> 00:22:29.357
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

00:22:29.357 --> 00:22:41.287
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

00:22:41.287 --> 00:22:47.617
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:52.717
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

00:22:52.717 --> 00:22:59.177
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:01.727
common disease with Indians.

00:23:01.727 --> 00:23:07.587
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

00:23:07.587 --> 00:23:10.447
separate bathrooms.

00:23:10.447 --> 00:23:13.057
In a collective life there is no need.

00:23:13.057 --> 00:23:20.067
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:22.527
just go there come back, finished.

00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:27.987
I have no time for all that.

00:23:27.987 --> 00:23:37.797
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

00:23:37.797 --> 00:23:42.607
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

00:23:42.607 --> 00:23:43.607
union?

00:23:43.607 --> 00:23:45.557
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:55.827
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

00:23:55.827 --> 00:24:02.977
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

00:24:02.977 --> 00:24:11.617
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:14.227
of Himalayas I should say.

00:24:14.227 --> 00:24:22.277
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

00:24:22.277 --> 00:24:27.397
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

00:24:27.397 --> 00:24:38.827
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

00:24:38.827 --> 00:24:40.647
of it.

00:24:40.647 --> 00:24:45.207
So we have to be very, very careful.

00:24:45.207 --> 00:25:00.357
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

00:25:00.357 --> 00:25:10.957
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

00:25:10.957 --> 00:25:17.247
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

00:25:17.247 --> 00:25:22.867
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:29.557
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

00:25:29.557 --> 00:25:42.308
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:50.237
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

00:25:50.237 --> 00:26:04.557
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

00:26:04.557 --> 00:26:07.277
huge earthquake.

00:26:07.277 --> 00:26:17.547
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

00:26:17.547 --> 00:26:24.307
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

00:26:24.307 --> 00:26:25.647
under protection.

00:26:25.647 --> 00:26:28.617
You are all the time protected.

00:26:28.617 --> 00:26:34.727
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

00:26:34.727 --> 00:26:38.447
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

00:26:38.447 --> 00:26:43.327
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

00:26:43.327 --> 00:26:50.167
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

00:26:50.167 --> 00:26:53.397
is protecting you and helping you.

00:26:53.397 --> 00:27:00.586
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:06.027
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

00:27:06.027 --> 00:27:13.967
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:20.347
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:25.837
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

00:27:25.837 --> 00:27:29.097
All these topics will fall.

00:27:29.097 --> 00:27:34.267
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

00:27:34.267 --> 00:27:36.527
No question.

00:27:36.527 --> 00:27:37.597
What do I like?

00:27:37.597 --> 00:27:46.227
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

00:27:46.227 --> 00:27:48.147
to be this way.

00:27:48.147 --> 00:27:49.187
Who are you?

00:27:49.187 --> 00:27:52.677
Ask yourself the question.

00:27:52.677 --> 00:27:55.227
Who are you?

00:27:55.227 --> 00:28:05.227
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

00:28:05.227 --> 00:28:12.497
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

00:28:12.497 --> 00:28:17.947
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

00:28:17.947 --> 00:28:20.047
This is what you have to reach.

00:28:20.047 --> 00:28:26.007
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:35.437
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

00:28:35.437 --> 00:28:37.297
You have to work it out.

00:28:37.297 --> 00:28:44.827
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

00:28:44.827 --> 00:28:48.627
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:52.667
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

00:28:52.667 --> 00:29:00.107
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

00:29:00.107 --> 00:29:03.377
what about my country.

00:29:03.377 --> 00:29:09.687
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

00:29:09.687 --> 00:29:16.557
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

00:29:16.557 --> 00:29:27.007
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

00:29:27.007 --> 00:29:28.357
I, I.

00:29:28.357 --> 00:29:37.336
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

00:29:37.336 --> 00:29:41.407
for the cleaning of the cotton.

00:29:41.407 --> 00:29:48.086
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:54.137
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

00:29:54.137 --> 00:29:59.407
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

00:29:59.407 --> 00:30:06.977
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:13.897
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

00:30:13.897 --> 00:30:23.657
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

00:30:23.657 --> 00:30:32.507
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

00:30:32.507 --> 00:30:41.107
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

00:30:41.107 --> 00:30:44.077
they plan something very bad.

00:30:44.077 --> 00:30:46.836
They can do anything.

00:30:46.836 --> 00:30:51.347
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

00:30:51.347 --> 00:30:52.837
they don’t do it.

00:30:52.837 --> 00:30:56.947
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

00:30:56.947 --> 00:31:04.827
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

00:31:04.827 --> 00:31:06.437
fuss about food.

00:31:06.437 --> 00:31:13.167
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

00:31:13.167 --> 00:31:16.417
- that we are like this, we are that.

00:31:16.417 --> 00:31:23.967
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

00:31:23.967 --> 00:31:28.147
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

00:31:28.147 --> 00:31:33.227
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

00:31:33.227 --> 00:31:36.977
I said ‘What?’

00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:38.867
I couldn’t understand the question.

00:31:38.867 --> 00:31:44.638
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

00:31:44.638 --> 00:31:46.277
is there to be proud?

00:31:46.277 --> 00:31:52.327
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:53.397
of.

00:31:53.397 --> 00:32:00.927
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

00:32:00.927 --> 00:32:09.907
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

00:32:09.907 --> 00:32:13.297
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

00:32:13.297 --> 00:32:22.076
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

00:32:22.076 --> 00:32:25.277
it, not at all conscious.

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:29.197
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:30.797
But it is so, what to do.

00:32:30.797 --> 00:32:36.347
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

00:32:36.347 --> 00:32:42.127
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:49.307
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

00:32:49.307 --> 00:32:58.997
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

00:32:58.997 --> 00:33:08.836
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

00:33:08.836 --> 00:33:09.836
gold’ - gold is gold.

00:33:09.836 --> 00:33:13.157
Why will it be proud of that?

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:22.527
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

00:33:22.527 --> 00:33:29.047
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

00:33:29.047 --> 00:33:30.687
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

00:33:30.687 --> 00:33:35.617
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

00:33:35.617 --> 00:33:42.507
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

00:33:42.507 --> 00:33:48.206
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

00:33:48.206 --> 00:33:56.086
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

00:33:56.086 --> 00:34:03.206
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

00:34:03.206 --> 00:34:04.757
left in me.

00:34:04.757 --> 00:34:11.137
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

00:34:11.137 --> 00:34:17.807
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

00:34:17.807 --> 00:34:28.676
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

00:34:28.676 --> 00:34:38.987
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

00:34:38.987 --> 00:34:52.737
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

00:34:52.737 --> 00:35:00.987
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

00:35:00.987 --> 00:35:04.547
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

00:35:04.547 --> 00:35:14.537
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

00:35:14.537 --> 00:35:21.677
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

00:35:21.677 --> 00:35:25.557
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

00:35:25.557 --> 00:35:33.607
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

00:35:33.607 --> 00:35:38.127
false, so how to make these two things meet.

00:35:38.127 --> 00:35:47.287
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

00:35:47.287 --> 00:35:48.287
primamvadeth.

00:35:48.287 --> 00:35:55.847
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

00:35:55.847 --> 00:36:04.457
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

00:36:04.457 --> 00:36:10.977
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

00:36:10.977 --> 00:36:17.447
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

00:36:17.447 --> 00:36:25.577
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

00:36:25.577 --> 00:36:29.547
said to me that I have done something perfect.

00:36:29.547 --> 00:36:37.237
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:43.367
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:48.127
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

00:36:48.127 --> 00:36:50.327
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

00:36:50.327 --> 00:36:54.037
All this is the play of ego.

00:36:54.037 --> 00:36:59.097
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

00:36:59.097 --> 00:37:02.327
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

00:37:02.327 --> 00:37:09.567
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

00:37:09.567 --> 00:37:17.757
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:22.198
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:26.927
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

00:37:26.927 --> 00:37:32.907
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

00:37:32.907 --> 00:37:33.907
do?

00:37:33.907 --> 00:37:39.717
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

00:37:39.717 --> 00:37:45.517
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

00:37:45.517 --> 00:37:50.637
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:53.537
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

00:37:53.537 --> 00:38:00.247
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

00:38:00.247 --> 00:38:05.497
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

00:38:05.497 --> 00:38:10.477
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

00:38:10.477 --> 00:38:17.136
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

00:38:17.136 --> 00:38:23.047
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

00:38:23.047 --> 00:38:28.307
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

00:38:28.307 --> 00:38:29.757
all the knowledge.

00:38:29.757 --> 00:38:36.247
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:45.847
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

00:38:45.847 --> 00:38:54.467
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

00:38:54.467 --> 00:39:01.297
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:04.327
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

00:39:04.327 --> 00:39:06.227
We have to think of the whole world.

00:39:06.227 --> 00:39:10.278
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

00:39:10.278 --> 00:39:14.868
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

00:39:14.868 --> 00:39:18.917
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

00:39:18.917 --> 00:39:24.457
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:27.247
So I am trying to do something for them.

00:39:27.247 --> 00:39:30.127
You have problems in your countries.

00:39:30.127 --> 00:39:33.107
You should find out what problems there are.

00:39:33.107 --> 00:39:39.636
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

00:39:39.636 --> 00:39:46.517
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:52.077
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

00:39:52.077 --> 00:39:53.227
to do it.

00:39:53.227 --> 00:39:58.057
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

00:39:58.057 --> 00:39:59.057
up.

00:39:59.057 --> 00:40:04.636
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:07.727
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

00:40:07.727 --> 00:40:12.637
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

00:40:12.637 --> 00:40:19.107
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

00:40:19.107 --> 00:40:25.477
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

00:40:25.477 --> 00:40:27.587
You are powerful.

00:40:27.587 --> 00:40:29.597
You have powers.

00:40:29.597 --> 00:40:33.467
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

00:40:33.467 --> 00:40:37.097
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

00:40:37.097 --> 00:40:44.827
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

00:40:44.827 --> 00:40:51.626
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

00:40:51.626 --> 00:40:58.707
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

00:40:58.707 --> 00:41:02.597
that we are chosen.

00:41:02.597 --> 00:41:09.717
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

00:41:09.717 --> 00:41:14.877
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

00:41:14.877 --> 00:41:19.827
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

00:41:19.827 --> 00:41:26.207
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

00:41:26.207 --> 00:41:31.297
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

00:41:31.297 --> 00:41:43.497
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

00:41:43.497 --> 00:41:47.987
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

00:41:47.987 --> 00:41:54.667
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

00:41:54.667 --> 00:42:04.997
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

00:42:04.997 --> 00:42:11.157
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

00:42:11.157 --> 00:42:19.107
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

00:42:19.107 --> 00:42:29.597
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

00:42:29.597 --> 00:42:33.797
is jealousy.

00:42:33.797 --> 00:42:40.487
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

00:42:40.487 --> 00:42:48.817
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

00:42:48.817 --> 00:42:56.657
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

00:42:56.657 --> 00:43:03.007
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

00:43:03.007 --> 00:43:10.537
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

00:43:10.537 --> 00:43:17.587
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

00:43:17.587 --> 00:43:21.587
We should not.

00:43:21.587 --> 00:43:28.567
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

00:43:28.567 --> 00:43:36.247
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:42.017
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

00:43:42.017 --> 00:43:47.277
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

00:43:47.277 --> 00:43:51.197
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

00:43:51.197 --> 00:43:53.947
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

00:43:53.947 --> 00:43:59.547
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

00:43:59.547 --> 00:44:05.077
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

00:44:05.077 --> 00:44:12.607
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

00:44:12.607 --> 00:44:19.977
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

00:44:19.977 --> 00:44:20.977
bad.

00:44:20.977 --> 00:44:28.817
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

00:44:28.817 --> 00:44:36.107
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

00:44:36.107 --> 00:44:40.117
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

00:44:40.117 --> 00:44:48.587
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

00:44:48.587 --> 00:44:55.107
dominating others, without showing off.

00:44:55.107 --> 00:45:03.117
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:12.237
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

00:45:12.237 --> 00:45:21.187
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

00:45:21.187 --> 00:45:29.767
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:31.247
and get it.

00:45:31.247 --> 00:45:41.117
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

00:45:41.117 --> 00:45:46.157
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

00:45:46.157 --> 00:45:47.947
Nothing!

00:45:47.947 --> 00:46:01.327
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

00:46:01.327 --> 00:46:10.967
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

00:46:10.967 --> 00:46:17.547
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

00:46:17.547 --> 00:46:23.837
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

00:46:23.837 --> 00:46:32.227
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

00:46:32.227 --> 00:46:33.787
That is not the idea.

00:46:33.787 --> 00:46:41.797
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

00:46:41.797 --> 00:46:58.497
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

00:46:58.497 --> 00:47:07.467
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

00:47:07.467 --> 00:47:18.626
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

00:47:18.626 --> 00:47:20.197
realm of God.

00:47:20.937 --> 00:47:23.107
That is what you are here for.

00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:26.007
May God bless you.
