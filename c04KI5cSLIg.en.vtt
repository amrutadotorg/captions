00:00.080 --> 00:01.655
SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

00:01.660 --> 00:02.660
CABELLA

00:02.830 --> 00:11.659
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

00:11.679 --> 00:33.390
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

00:33.390 --> 00:48.529
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

00:48.529 --> 00:52.680
you have achieved we have to see it.

00:52.680 --> 01:12.479
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

01:12.479 --> 01:23.840
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

01:23.840 --> 01:34.606
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

01:35.176 --> 01:37.877
It’s established.

01:37.877 --> 01:43.297
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

01:43.297 --> 01:53.817
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

01:53.817 --> 02:01.657
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

02:01.657 --> 02:08.057
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

02:08.057 --> 02:18.507
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

02:18.507 --> 02:26.327
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

02:26.327 --> 02:37.167
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

02:37.167 --> 02:43.626
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

02:43.626 --> 02:54.117
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

02:54.117 --> 03:07.567
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

03:07.567 --> 03:21.346
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

03:21.346 --> 03:23.817
also starts flowing with it.

03:23.817 --> 03:33.957
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

03:33.957 --> 03:44.317
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

03:44.317 --> 03:47.207
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

03:47.207 --> 03:54.527
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

03:54.527 --> 04:01.117
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

04:01.117 --> 04:07.107
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

04:07.107 --> 04:13.367
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

04:13.367 --> 04:21.726
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

04:21.726 --> 04:24.207
go to them.

04:24.207 --> 04:36.207
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

04:36.207 --> 04:40.527
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

04:40.527 --> 04:48.937
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

04:48.937 --> 04:59.237
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

04:59.237 --> 05:05.387
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

05:05.387 --> 05:15.857
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

05:15.857 --> 05:25.916
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

05:25.916 --> 05:29.617
No one can harm you.

05:29.617 --> 05:35.857
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

05:35.857 --> 05:45.957
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

05:45.957 --> 05:54.027
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

05:54.027 --> 05:58.476
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

05:58.476 --> 06:02.237
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

06:02.237 --> 06:14.457
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

06:14.457 --> 06:20.737
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

06:20.737 --> 06:29.407
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

06:29.407 --> 06:31.887
He is a religious man.

06:31.887 --> 06:36.667
He should also put stones on her.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.967
But He was standing on truth.

06:39.967 --> 06:47.476
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

06:47.476 --> 06:49.397
that you stand on truth.

06:49.397 --> 06:59.767
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

06:59.767 --> 07:09.027
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

07:09.027 --> 07:10.977
to the left.

07:10.977 --> 07:22.376
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

07:22.376 --> 07:27.416
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

07:27.416 --> 07:32.717
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

07:32.717 --> 07:39.907
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

07:39.907 --> 07:44.816
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

07:44.816 --> 07:50.907
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

07:50.907 --> 07:52.786
way do that way.

07:52.786 --> 07:59.777
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

07:59.777 --> 08:10.607
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

08:10.607 --> 08:16.107
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

08:16.107 --> 08:28.006
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

08:28.006 --> 08:32.006
religion even about Sahaj religion.

08:32.006 --> 08:39.937
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.937
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

08:43.937 --> 08:53.537
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

08:53.537 --> 08:58.147
he is in that truth.

08:58.147 --> 09:06.147
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

09:06.147 --> 09:10.187
to all of you.

09:10.187 --> 09:15.977
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

09:15.977 --> 09:23.067
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

09:23.067 --> 09:28.217
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

09:28.217 --> 09:33.387
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

09:33.387 --> 09:44.407
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

09:44.407 --> 09:47.677
on truth or untruth.

09:47.677 --> 09:54.007
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

09:54.007 --> 10:01.347
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

10:01.347 --> 10:03.647
branches in the body.

10:03.647 --> 10:10.637
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

10:10.637 --> 10:14.477
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

10:14.477 --> 10:28.337
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

10:28.337 --> 10:31.587
we have taken.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.477
We have now become dharmic.

10:34.477 --> 10:37.007
What is the root of dharma?

10:37.007 --> 10:42.427
Why should we be dharmic?

10:42.427 --> 10:43.847
What is the need to be dharmic?

10:43.847 --> 10:49.307
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

10:49.307 --> 10:55.377
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

10:55.377 --> 11:03.457
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

11:03.457 --> 11:06.977
enjoyments of these people.

11:06.977 --> 11:18.857
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

11:18.857 --> 11:20.927
standing on truth.

11:20.927 --> 11:27.277
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

11:27.277 --> 11:31.107
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

11:31.107 --> 11:44.377
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

11:44.377 --> 11:46.327
even their language improves.

11:46.327 --> 11:57.067
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

11:57.067 --> 12:02.237
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

12:02.237 --> 12:07.397
This consciousness has to disappear.

12:07.397 --> 12:26.217
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

12:26.217 --> 12:28.837
is truth.

12:28.837 --> 12:35.487
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

12:35.487 --> 12:39.507
As you know the pita of heart is here.

12:39.507 --> 12:48.667
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

12:48.667 --> 12:55.197
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

12:55.197 --> 13:03.487
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

13:03.487 --> 13:09.457
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

13:09.457 --> 13:20.757
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

13:20.757 --> 13:24.347
love, the pure love.

13:24.347 --> 13:33.087
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

13:33.087 --> 13:41.547
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

13:41.547 --> 13:55.787
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

13:55.787 --> 14:00.717
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

14:00.717 --> 14:12.747
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

14:12.747 --> 14:18.187
- that’s the personality you have to become.

14:18.187 --> 14:26.967
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

14:26.967 --> 14:33.857
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

14:33.857 --> 14:37.227
person.

14:37.227 --> 14:44.187
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

14:44.187 --> 14:45.187
things.

14:45.187 --> 14:56.387
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

14:56.387 --> 15:00.567
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

15:00.567 --> 15:06.547
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

15:06.547 --> 15:09.277
here you are talking like this.

15:09.277 --> 15:18.157
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

15:18.157 --> 15:25.207
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

15:25.207 --> 15:34.507
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

15:34.507 --> 15:44.657
to say things by which they become one, united.

15:44.657 --> 15:52.277
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

15:52.277 --> 16:03.517
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

16:03.517 --> 16:10.218
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

16:10.218 --> 16:20.597
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

16:20.597 --> 16:25.837
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

16:25.837 --> 16:36.437
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

16:36.437 --> 16:40.697
collective consciousness.

16:40.697 --> 16:44.027
Now people talk of peace.

16:44.027 --> 16:50.437
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

16:50.437 --> 17:01.736
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

17:01.736 --> 17:13.317
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

17:13.317 --> 17:14.317
fulfilling.

17:14.317 --> 17:24.387
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

17:24.387 --> 17:33.947
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

17:33.947 --> 17:43.117
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

17:43.117 --> 17:51.827
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

17:51.827 --> 17:54.937
we can change this world.

17:54.937 --> 18:06.337
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

18:06.337 --> 18:12.537
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

18:12.537 --> 18:15.767
Why do you hate someone.

18:15.767 --> 18:22.497
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

18:22.497 --> 18:23.947
sake.

18:23.947 --> 18:31.417
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

18:31.417 --> 18:38.957
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

18:38.957 --> 18:45.477
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

18:45.477 --> 18:54.907
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

18:54.907 --> 18:58.347
This doesn’t stop.

18:58.347 --> 19:00.537
By dividing us what has happened?

19:00.537 --> 19:06.517
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

19:06.517 --> 19:12.417
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

19:12.417 --> 19:13.687
this that.

19:13.687 --> 19:18.277
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

19:18.277 --> 19:22.167
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

19:22.167 --> 19:31.807
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

19:31.807 --> 19:34.087
country being divided.

19:34.087 --> 19:43.187
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

19:43.187 --> 19:54.217
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

19:54.217 --> 20:02.757
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

20:02.757 --> 20:11.417
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

20:11.417 --> 20:15.157
Why?

20:15.157 --> 20:20.897
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

20:20.897 --> 20:24.057
separate houses?

20:24.057 --> 20:26.817
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

20:26.817 --> 20:36.187
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

20:36.187 --> 20:37.287
houses.

20:37.287 --> 20:44.097
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

20:44.097 --> 20:52.807
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

20:52.807 --> 20:53.877
are catching.

20:53.877 --> 20:54.957
Isn’t it?

20:54.957 --> 20:59.187
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

20:59.187 --> 21:05.617
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

21:05.617 --> 21:06.617
understand.

21:06.617 --> 21:14.157
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

21:14.157 --> 21:17.847
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

21:17.847 --> 21:26.767
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

21:26.767 --> 21:27.767
to do.

21:27.767 --> 21:35.687
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

21:35.687 --> 21:44.317
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

21:44.317 --> 21:50.897
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

21:50.897 --> 21:58.687
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

21:58.687 --> 21:59.687
that.

21:59.687 --> 22:05.377
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

22:05.377 --> 22:06.867
So there is nothing like that.

22:06.867 --> 22:13.297
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

22:13.297 --> 22:16.637
who tries all kinds of tricks.

22:16.637 --> 22:29.357
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

22:29.357 --> 22:41.287
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

22:41.287 --> 22:47.617
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

22:47.617 --> 22:52.717
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

22:52.717 --> 22:59.177
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

22:59.177 --> 23:01.727
common disease with Indians.

23:01.727 --> 23:07.587
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

23:07.587 --> 23:10.447
separate bathrooms.

23:10.447 --> 23:13.057
In a collective life there is no need.

23:13.057 --> 23:20.067
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

23:20.067 --> 23:22.527
just go there come back, finished.

23:22.527 --> 23:27.987
I have no time for all that.

23:27.987 --> 23:37.797
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

23:37.797 --> 23:42.607
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

23:42.607 --> 23:43.607
union?

23:43.607 --> 23:45.557
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

23:45.557 --> 23:55.827
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

23:55.827 --> 24:02.977
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

24:02.977 --> 24:11.617
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

24:11.617 --> 24:14.227
of Himalayas I should say.

24:14.227 --> 24:22.277
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

24:22.277 --> 24:27.397
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

24:27.397 --> 24:38.827
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

24:38.827 --> 24:40.647
of it.

24:40.647 --> 24:45.207
So we have to be very, very careful.

24:45.207 --> 25:00.357
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

25:00.357 --> 25:10.957
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

25:10.957 --> 25:17.247
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

25:17.247 --> 25:22.867
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

25:22.867 --> 25:29.557
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

25:29.557 --> 25:42.308
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

25:42.308 --> 25:50.237
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

25:50.237 --> 26:04.557
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

26:04.557 --> 26:07.277
huge earthquake.

26:07.277 --> 26:17.547
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

26:17.547 --> 26:24.307
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

26:24.307 --> 26:25.647
under protection.

26:25.647 --> 26:28.617
You are all the time protected.

26:28.617 --> 26:34.727
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

26:34.727 --> 26:38.447
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

26:38.447 --> 26:43.327
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

26:43.327 --> 26:50.167
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

26:50.167 --> 26:53.397
is protecting you and helping you.

26:53.397 --> 27:00.586
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

27:00.586 --> 27:06.027
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

27:06.027 --> 27:13.967
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

27:13.967 --> 27:20.347
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

27:20.347 --> 27:25.837
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

27:25.837 --> 27:29.097
All these topics will fall.

27:29.097 --> 27:34.267
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

27:34.267 --> 27:36.527
No question.

27:36.527 --> 27:37.597
What do I like?

27:37.597 --> 27:46.227
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

27:46.227 --> 27:48.147
to be this way.

27:48.147 --> 27:49.187
Who are you?

27:49.187 --> 27:52.677
Ask yourself the question.

27:52.677 --> 27:55.227
Who are you?

27:55.227 --> 28:05.227
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

28:05.227 --> 28:12.497
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

28:12.497 --> 28:17.947
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.047
This is what you have to reach.

28:20.047 --> 28:26.007
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

28:26.007 --> 28:35.437
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

28:35.437 --> 28:37.297
You have to work it out.

28:37.297 --> 28:44.827
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

28:44.827 --> 28:48.627
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

28:48.627 --> 28:52.667
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

28:52.667 --> 29:00.107
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

29:00.107 --> 29:03.377
what about my country.

29:03.377 --> 29:09.687
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

29:09.687 --> 29:16.557
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

29:16.557 --> 29:27.007
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

29:27.007 --> 29:28.357
I, I.

29:28.357 --> 29:37.336
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

29:37.336 --> 29:41.407
for the cleaning of the cotton.

29:41.407 --> 29:48.086
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

29:48.086 --> 29:54.137
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

29:54.137 --> 29:59.407
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

29:59.407 --> 30:06.977
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

30:06.977 --> 30:13.897
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

30:13.897 --> 30:23.657
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

30:23.657 --> 30:32.507
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

30:32.507 --> 30:41.107
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

30:41.107 --> 30:44.077
they plan something very bad.

30:44.077 --> 30:46.836
They can do anything.

30:46.836 --> 30:51.347
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

30:51.347 --> 30:52.837
they don’t do it.

30:52.837 --> 30:56.947
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

30:56.947 --> 31:04.827
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

31:04.827 --> 31:06.437
fuss about food.

31:06.437 --> 31:13.167
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

31:13.167 --> 31:16.417
- that we are like this, we are that.

31:16.417 --> 31:23.967
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

31:23.967 --> 31:28.147
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

31:28.147 --> 31:33.227
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

31:33.227 --> 31:36.977
I said ‘What?’

31:36.977 --> 31:38.867
I couldn’t understand the question.

31:38.867 --> 31:44.638
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

31:44.638 --> 31:46.277
is there to be proud?

31:46.277 --> 31:52.327
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

31:52.327 --> 31:53.397
of.

31:53.397 --> 32:00.927
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

32:00.927 --> 32:09.907
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

32:09.907 --> 32:13.297
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

32:13.297 --> 32:22.076
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

32:22.076 --> 32:25.277
it, not at all conscious.

32:25.277 --> 32:29.197
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.797
But it is so, what to do.

32:30.797 --> 32:36.347
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

32:36.347 --> 32:42.127
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

32:42.127 --> 32:49.307
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

32:49.307 --> 32:58.997
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

32:58.997 --> 33:08.836
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

33:08.836 --> 33:09.836
gold’ - gold is gold.

33:09.836 --> 33:13.157
Why will it be proud of that?

33:13.157 --> 33:22.527
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

33:22.527 --> 33:29.047
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

33:29.047 --> 33:30.687
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

33:30.687 --> 33:35.617
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

33:35.617 --> 33:42.507
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

33:42.507 --> 33:48.206
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

33:48.206 --> 33:56.086
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

33:56.086 --> 34:03.206
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

34:03.206 --> 34:04.757
left in me.

34:04.757 --> 34:11.137
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

34:11.137 --> 34:17.807
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

34:17.807 --> 34:28.676
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

34:28.676 --> 34:38.987
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

34:38.987 --> 34:52.737
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

34:52.737 --> 35:00.987
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

35:00.987 --> 35:04.547
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

35:04.547 --> 35:14.537
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

35:14.537 --> 35:21.677
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

35:21.677 --> 35:25.557
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

35:25.557 --> 35:33.607
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

35:33.607 --> 35:38.127
false, so how to make these two things meet.

35:38.127 --> 35:47.287
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

35:47.287 --> 35:48.287
primamvadeth.

35:48.287 --> 35:55.847
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

35:55.847 --> 36:04.457
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

36:04.457 --> 36:10.977
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

36:10.977 --> 36:17.447
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

36:17.447 --> 36:25.577
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

36:25.577 --> 36:29.547
said to me that I have done something perfect.

36:29.547 --> 36:37.237
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

36:37.237 --> 36:43.367
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

36:43.367 --> 36:48.127
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

36:48.127 --> 36:50.327
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

36:50.327 --> 36:54.037
All this is the play of ego.

36:54.037 --> 36:59.097
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

36:59.097 --> 37:02.327
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

37:02.327 --> 37:09.567
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

37:09.567 --> 37:17.757
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

37:17.757 --> 37:22.198
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

37:22.198 --> 37:26.927
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

37:26.927 --> 37:32.907
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

37:32.907 --> 37:33.907
do?

37:33.907 --> 37:39.717
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

37:39.717 --> 37:45.517
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

37:45.517 --> 37:50.637
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

37:50.637 --> 37:53.537
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

37:53.537 --> 38:00.247
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

38:00.247 --> 38:05.497
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

38:05.497 --> 38:10.477
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

38:10.477 --> 38:17.136
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

38:17.136 --> 38:23.047
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

38:23.047 --> 38:28.307
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

38:28.307 --> 38:29.757
all the knowledge.

38:29.757 --> 38:36.247
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

38:36.247 --> 38:45.847
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

38:45.847 --> 38:54.467
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

38:54.467 --> 39:01.297
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

39:01.297 --> 39:04.327
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

39:04.327 --> 39:06.227
We have to think of the whole world.

39:06.227 --> 39:10.278
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

39:10.278 --> 39:14.868
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

39:14.868 --> 39:18.917
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

39:18.917 --> 39:24.457
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

39:24.457 --> 39:27.247
So I am trying to do something for them.

39:27.247 --> 39:30.127
You have problems in your countries.

39:30.127 --> 39:33.107
You should find out what problems there are.

39:33.107 --> 39:39.636
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

39:39.636 --> 39:46.517
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

39:46.517 --> 39:52.077
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

39:52.077 --> 39:53.227
to do it.

39:53.227 --> 39:58.057
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

39:58.057 --> 39:59.057
up.

39:59.057 --> 40:04.636
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

40:04.636 --> 40:07.727
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

40:07.727 --> 40:12.637
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

40:12.637 --> 40:19.107
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

40:19.107 --> 40:25.477
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

40:25.477 --> 40:27.587
You are powerful.

40:27.587 --> 40:29.597
You have powers.

40:29.597 --> 40:33.467
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

40:33.467 --> 40:37.097
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

40:37.097 --> 40:44.827
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

40:44.827 --> 40:51.626
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

40:51.626 --> 40:58.707
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

40:58.707 --> 41:02.597
that we are chosen.

41:02.597 --> 41:09.717
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

41:09.717 --> 41:14.877
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

41:14.877 --> 41:19.827
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

41:19.827 --> 41:26.207
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

41:26.207 --> 41:31.297
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

41:31.297 --> 41:43.497
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

41:43.497 --> 41:47.987
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

41:47.987 --> 41:54.667
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

41:54.667 --> 42:04.997
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

42:04.997 --> 42:11.157
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

42:11.157 --> 42:19.107
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

42:19.107 --> 42:29.597
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

42:29.597 --> 42:33.797
is jealousy.

42:33.797 --> 42:40.487
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

42:40.487 --> 42:48.817
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

42:48.817 --> 42:56.657
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

42:56.657 --> 43:03.007
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

43:03.007 --> 43:10.537
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

43:10.537 --> 43:17.587
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

43:17.587 --> 43:21.587
We should not.

43:21.587 --> 43:28.567
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

43:28.567 --> 43:36.247
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

43:36.247 --> 43:42.017
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

43:42.017 --> 43:47.277
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

43:47.277 --> 43:51.197
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

43:51.197 --> 43:53.947
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

43:53.947 --> 43:59.547
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

43:59.547 --> 44:05.077
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

44:05.077 --> 44:12.607
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

44:12.607 --> 44:19.977
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

44:19.977 --> 44:20.977
bad.

44:20.977 --> 44:28.817
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

44:28.817 --> 44:36.107
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

44:36.107 --> 44:40.117
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

44:40.117 --> 44:48.587
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

44:48.587 --> 44:55.107
dominating others, without showing off.

44:55.107 --> 45:03.117
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

45:03.117 --> 45:12.237
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

45:12.237 --> 45:21.187
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

45:21.187 --> 45:29.767
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

45:29.767 --> 45:31.247
and get it.

45:31.247 --> 45:41.117
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

45:41.117 --> 45:46.157
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

45:46.157 --> 45:47.947
Nothing!

45:47.947 --> 46:01.327
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

46:01.327 --> 46:10.967
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

46:10.967 --> 46:17.547
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

46:17.547 --> 46:23.837
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

46:23.837 --> 46:32.227
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

46:32.227 --> 46:33.787
That is not the idea.

46:33.787 --> 46:41.797
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

46:41.797 --> 46:58.497
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

46:58.497 --> 47:07.467
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

47:07.467 --> 47:18.626
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

47:18.626 --> 47:20.197
realm of God.

47:20.937 --> 47:23.107
That is what you are here for.

47:23.917 --> 47:26.007
May God bless you.
