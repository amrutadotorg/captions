WEBVTT

00:01.730 --> 00:08.750
Because many people have written about it
(inaudible) and a lot of people have been thinking that

00:08.982 --> 00:17.662
something should be done in this matter
of finding the truth. (Unclear)

00:19.990 --> 00:36.680
Now when human (inaudible) his condition would be such
that he only believes this thing (inaudible)
and he has no other means.

00:37.206 --> 00:44.936
Whatever have been the achievements of Science, we have
seen only through the medium of intellect.

00:45.162 --> 00:56.462
But the intelligence that is, tells us only about what
is visible in the world. It tells us nothing about what
is invisible or can’t be seen.

00:56.525 --> 01:00.155
And can’t even tell what is the difference
between the Truth and invisible.

01:01.657 --> 01:10.797
Then it should be thought first that when a person
talks of the search for Truth then first of all
he has to consider

01:11.078 --> 01:17.408
that whatever we have known through the intellect, have
known nothing, even then we remained in illusion.

01:17.421 --> 01:24.171
What we have known through our intelligence,
whatever we have known till now, that much has happened,

01:24.171 --> 01:30.917
we have known from what is visible (UNCLEAR) but
have not known what is in the invisible or hidden.

01:30.917 --> 01:37.226
And could not even know that what we have to know from
what is visible whether it is the Absolute Truth or not.

01:39.443 --> 01:47.133
Now when the achievement of Science is ours, then Science
is on our heads, we have known a lot through Science.

01:47.589 --> 01:58.989
We have reached up to the atom and molecule.
The activities that we have understood are also
of all that is gross or non-living.

02:00.468 --> 02:06.228
..... How it happens with everyone in the world,
no one has any attention towards it.

02:07.992 --> 02:17.232
The first thing to be thought about in the search
for Truth, that whatever man can do,
is there any creation beyond that or not?

02:18.515 --> 02:27.235
For example, as we watch any living thing - a human-being
walking, strolling, growing, becoming anxious, see everything,

02:27.545 --> 02:37.790
but we don't look this way, we don’t visualize/pay
attention to the fact, why is this man made - first thing,

02:40.364 --> 02:48.894
because we don't have an answer to it. The speciality
of man is that he turns his face away from the fact
to which he does not have an answer.

02:50.309 --> 02:58.269
And says that, he would like to stay at the point
to which he has an answer. He thinks that it
would be wrong to go beyond that point.

03:01.086 --> 03:07.946
But man came into the world, Science told us
that man has been created/made from an amoeba.

03:09.084 --> 03:18.994
Then it should immediately come to our minds
that such special events that have happened,

03:18.994 --> 03:26.256
and because of which they are all inferior to us,
these are inert/inanimate things, we can make them.

03:26.256 --> 03:33.197
Man's vision reaches there, that okay
we're making it, so we made it and we
have become a very great person

03:33.197 --> 03:41.525
or we have done a very great work. But even a stone
cannot be made by man, not even an atom or
molecule of it.

03:42.482 --> 03:47.262
Only if man could think with a little humility that,
"Can I make this stone myself?

03:51.006 --> 03:56.656
Of all the elements, can I make even a single element myself?

03:58.573 --> 04:04.633
It’s valances etc. are made so beautifully
can I create something like this?"

04:04.633 --> 04:14.620
It's okay, that you’ve assembled a dead thing.
But in it’s creation can you have any

04:14.620 --> 04:22.858
intervention – you cannot have.
You can't change anything about/in it.

04:22.858 --> 04:30.231
As it is, so shall it remain. You can make it’s
compounds, can make mixtures from it.

04:30.921 --> 04:39.428
But if sulphur is burnt and if we make crystals from it,
they will be made in the same way as they are made of sulphur.

04:40.128 --> 04:45.229
Now if you want to create your own style of
crystals, you cannot create even that.

04:45.229 --> 04:52.886
You can not interfere in it’s properties.
Yes, you can use those properties

04:52.886 --> 05:01.676
but you cannot change their basic fundamental properties.

05:04.096 --> 05:13.726
So who has made this and in whose power is it that He
can change it? Here also one should have a point of view.

05:13.833 --> 05:19.883
Living in the dark, if you say that there is
no light, then this would be wrong.

05:20.913 --> 05:27.058
But if someone says that there is light, then,
be it any scientist, any intellectual man,

05:27.058 --> 05:32.978
he should say that if there is light we should
see it. There must be curiosity or inquisitiveness.

05:32.978 --> 05:41.169
There should be curiosity in the mind of man that, after all
if he is saying that there is some light beyond it,
so why not have a look?

05:41.651 --> 05:48.491
But the way we are influenced by ourselves,
there's so much autohypnosis,

05:48.491 --> 05:55.451
that we think that whatever we can work out
only that is true and what we cannot work out,
there’s no need to look there.

05:57.271 --> 06:06.181
Thus you can understand how far away we are from Truth,
that we haven’t even touched it’s basic facts.

06:07.311 --> 06:14.951
The first question is that the One who created the universe
that is created, and Who has made such a beautiful arrangement
in all the molecules, particles and atoms of this universe,

06:14.951 --> 06:22.460
Who has made it so systematically,
Who is this administrator?

06:26.009 --> 06:32.269
One thing can be said that people are honest,
that say, ‘We can't go any further than this,
so we’ll stay here.’

06:32.269 --> 06:39.018
But if we say, you can grow,
you can go further than this,

06:39.018 --> 06:48.801
and beyond this there is another area, another
dimension, so why not open your eyes to all this?

06:51.792 --> 07:02.972
We have only an ego that, "We have done this,
we have found this out, we have this, that,
but whatever it is, it is inferior to you.

07:05.122 --> 07:10.645
If you want to rise above, anywhere, you
have to hold on to something above.

07:13.215 --> 07:22.725
Wherever one has to climb - you must have seen that when people
climb a big hill, then they hammer a nail up there first
and then hold it.

07:23.226 --> 07:28.476
This is what you call hypothesis etc. in
Science where an assumption has to be made.

07:28.476 --> 07:35.316
Nailed the nail of that concept, then holding
up that nail rose higher, and then went
forward to see what happens.

07:37.135 --> 07:44.765
Whether the nail is actually nailed or not, whether
we have reached there or not, a person can only
see after reaching there in reality.

07:46.595 --> 07:50.465
But by turning away completely, this work
is not going to happen.

07:52.456 --> 08:01.726
Now if we say that those who great saints and sages that
have been, the great Incarnations who have incarnated here
In India, in this land of yoga,

08:01.726 --> 08:07.056
who have done great deeds, whom till this day
the world is worshipping and believing in,

08:07.526 --> 08:13.196
these people didn't lie, so you would say,
"Yes, they used to lie, what is the proof of this?"

08:13.223 --> 08:17.743
If you say so, then we can’t stop you.

08:18.773 --> 08:24.283
Whether there is God or not, this too if it is
now a matter of debate, we can't stop you.

08:25.377 --> 08:31.747
But if we say that we prove it to you,
then why not move in that direction.

08:32.607 --> 08:40.397
If you are a worshipper of Truth and you
want to know the Truth, if someone says
that you can progress in it,

08:40.397 --> 08:48.401
not only this but you can know that Truth completely,
then why don't we most humbly accept that,

08:48.475 --> 08:52.965
"Okay, let's go and see, which is the path Mother is telling?
Let's see whether it is correct or not.”

08:53.215 --> 09:01.645
Accepted that this thing was not universal till now,
was not collective and very few people knew about it

09:01.694 --> 09:08.564
That's why there were misunderstandings, but just
like there are things of Science electricity etc.,
as many as/whatever are discovered,

09:08.564 --> 09:14.786
the way they are collective and global today
and are used for the common good,

09:14.786 --> 09:21.536
when we want to get to something higher than this,
then the things we have used till date

09:21.536 --> 09:26.308
to attain the things lower than us and
acquire them, not only this,

09:26.308 --> 09:30.418
in order to have authority over them, we
have to give up the use of those things.

09:30.418 --> 09:34.929
For example, if you want to move around in Delhi,
then car is fine but if you want to go/fly up,
you need an aeroplane.

09:37.269 --> 09:42.740
It’s speed is also different, it’s modus operandi
or style is different, all it’s projects are different.

09:44.822 --> 09:49.972
The motor-car is a different thing, it moves on the
ground and this is an air-plane flying in the sky.

09:50.402 --> 09:55.710
Similarly, when I am saying to you,
that you have to know the Spirit,

09:55.788 --> 10:03.448
the Spirit has to be used, with the help of the
Spirit only you can know the Divine,

10:03.448 --> 10:09.098
so it means that with the help of intelligence only
you understand the whole world, you have come to know,

10:09.098 --> 10:12.915
then you will have to find something
beyond that - that is the Spirit.

10:14.599 --> 10:18.969
If there is no mention of the Spirit in Science,
then only this can be said that

10:18.969 --> 10:23.665
yet Science has not been able to move in that
direction, it'll never even come to know

10:23.665 --> 10:32.398
because the limited area from which you want to know
it, it is beyond that, you won't be able to see it.

10:32.859 --> 10:42.629
It’s range is not such that that you get to know
it. Thus the range of this machinery, has to be increased.

10:43.640 --> 10:49.003
And while increasing that range if I say that,
until the light of the Spirit comes into it

10:49.003 --> 10:55.250
till then the work won’t be done, you must
accept it so that we attain it.

10:56.830 --> 11:01.750
As we see a person has a very good microscope

11:01.750 --> 11:10.823
that lets him see how each muscle is and how
is the flow of blood in it, we see all this

11:10.983 --> 11:18.183
but when we see that another person has a
good machine, even better than this one,
so we want somehow to get it.

11:19.971 --> 11:24.712
Similarly, if a person sees that
the other person has got something special,

11:24.712 --> 11:29.743
so he should have a desire to achieve that
special thing, but it does not happen.

11:31.356 --> 11:38.836
This is not the case with the Spirit because man
only wants to know that, "What I am today,

11:38.836 --> 11:44.436
I should get everything in it only. If I want to
rise further, means it’s a disrespect to myself only.”

11:47.805 --> 11:54.415
In the case of Science, he doesn’t think so.
In the matter of Science, if America did
some research, he will rush there.

11:54.415 --> 12:01.178
Then does not think that, “We are Indians, why should we
run after them.” If Russia did something,
then he will run after them.

12:02.293 --> 12:11.853
But if there’s some exploration in some other
area, then man is not interested in it.

12:14.423 --> 12:20.713
Man knows all about the outside of the tree
but nothing is known about it’s roots.

12:20.944 --> 12:30.584
And to know about it’s roots, you have to become subtle
and to achieve that subtlety, you need humility.

12:31.945 --> 12:36.745
If you want that on the basis of your intellect
you achieve it, you can't.

12:38.677 --> 12:43.797
One simple thing people don't understand
is whenever I give a speech etc., whatever/anything

12:43.797 --> 12:48.904
then I see the first question is,
that it is written in such-and-such a book -

12:48.904 --> 12:55.914
(It's) done, then what to talk about? Okay, whatever is written
(that) is not going to be judged by your intelligence.

12:56.224 --> 12:59.395
You won't be able to understand it. I’m saying
that you will not be able to understand.

12:59.395 --> 13:05.653
Please understand, if we can't see without glasses
then it’s important for us to wear glasses - this point
we understand.

13:05.653 --> 13:12.183
And, if except the Spirit we can’t know/understand God,
then you should get to the Spirit – this simple
fact why shouldn't you understand!

13:12.383 --> 13:16.603
Will you be able to find the Truth by doubting it?

13:16.764 --> 13:21.364
If in reality you are a worshipper of Truth and
you really want to know the Truth,

13:21.364 --> 13:27.210
so first of all there should be humility that
till now we haven't found the Truth.

13:32.586 --> 13:35.296
This is a great virtue – humility.

13:38.312 --> 13:43.402
Man learns anything but can't learn humility.

13:48.261 --> 13:55.381
What do you do in humility? Some people
get the idea that being humble means
you have bowed down/succumbed before someone.

13:57.611 --> 14:05.821
This is a big misconception. Humility means
that you have opened yourself up to accept -

14:06.559 --> 14:15.989
accept a new ideology, to accept something new,
seeing, testing, understanding, getting deep into it.

14:18.579 --> 14:23.029
Humility never means that you bow down before someone.

14:23.750 --> 14:29.310
No matter how high the branches of the tree
may rise, till its roots

14:29.560 --> 14:35.498
reach the source after digging the ground,
no power of any kind can enter that tree.

14:35.694 --> 14:43.514
In the same way no matter how much your civilization/
decency/politeness increases and no matter how much
this mess of Science increases,

14:43.514 --> 14:54.605
but until you have found your Spirit, the whole of it,
will be destroyed, will be finished, just like a bubble.

14:57.321 --> 15:03.691
None of this is going to survive and that’s
what has been happening all over the world.

15:03.691 --> 15:08.971
I just met a lady who said that they had gone
for the disarmament of the armament,

15:08.971 --> 15:15.263
‘We worked so hard, told the people that there
must be disarmament and everything would be fine
with disarmament and there were many disputes

15:15.263 --> 15:21.053
and there we worked hard for four months and
no one listened and we were great failures.’

15:21.053 --> 15:29.543
Tell me. This means that human-beings are
not left with any intellect.

15:31.369 --> 15:39.699
There should be disarmament – even a simple person
can understand that what is the need of one human
going around killing other humans.

15:41.252 --> 15:49.992
Except man no animal kills other animals taking arms.
It doesn't have the power even to hold it.

15:51.392 --> 15:58.152
God has given us hands, so now we kill others by
taking guns. Is this a matter of great wisdom?

16:00.392 --> 16:04.061
Science cannot treat this, can it?

16:05.199 --> 16:10.399
If scientists can fill wisdom in people,
then I will think them to be great.

16:15.035 --> 16:22.375
Intelligence or wisdom cannot come inside anyone, through
Science. If he wants to, he can make an atom bomb.

16:22.375 --> 16:28.442
And if he wants he can make one or the other
good hospital but it is at his will.

16:30.712 --> 16:37.679
It is not a fixed thing, it is movable/transient. Today
he will build a big hospital, a huge one.

16:37.679 --> 16:46.189
He will cure thousands of people there and later one day,
can all of a sudden destroy it by dropping a bomb on it.

16:46.189 --> 16:51.169
You can't guarantee that.
Does Science guarantee it

16:51.169 --> 16:55.949
that the man who is doing good work today because
of Science, will tomorrow not destroy it?

16:57.641 --> 17:01.041
Can you give any guarantee of man
with Science?

17:08.008 --> 17:17.548
When Science is so incomplete then we
should see why is it’s light so dim?

17:21.698 --> 17:28.558
Why is it so, that in it’s light a person is
sometimes seen standing on the path and
sometimes falls into the ditch?

17:29.199 --> 17:38.219
And as long as man is not capable or competent
enough, till the motivation or inspiration for Truth
is not strong enough in man,

17:38.296 --> 17:46.406
till then, whether you do any social work of the world,
any political work or any work with your intellect,
there’s no stability for him.

17:46.416 --> 17:59.796
Today you will be high up in the sky, tomorrow you
will drown in the river because Science doesn’t
make any human being capable enough and cannot make.

18:00.656 --> 18:06.126
No man can ever be competent or capable
enough with ego. ‘sam’ ‘arth’

18:11.636 --> 18:18.896
So must reach this result, what is called
the logical conclusion and think

18:18.896 --> 18:25.406
that with the intellect alone we cannot find the Truth.

18:26.635 --> 18:36.166
By intellect we can tell that a white sheet is spread
here, that it is a khadi sheet - just this,
what else? How far can we go?

18:41.226 --> 18:49.416
But can you tell from this khadi sheet,
whether it was worn by a saint or a demon?

18:56.378 --> 19:01.288
With Science you can't even tell whether
this person is a demon or he is a human being?

19:01.525 --> 19:07.045
And can’t even say and don’t know whether the one
who looks like a human today, may tomorrow
become a ghost and sit on your head.

19:08.606 --> 19:12.846
There is no surety of anything - everything
is mobile/unsustainable, unstable.

19:12.846 --> 19:21.265
That's why nowadays in Kalyuga it is said that
man is completely in delusion, in confusion.

19:22.985 --> 19:28.665
And in this tumult/uproar when man thinks that,
"Hey, now Kalyuga has come,

19:28.765 --> 19:34.344
now what is Mataji talking about in this? Now
this is what happens in Kalyuga, this is Kalyuga."

19:34.344 --> 19:38.584
It means that everything has become a guarantee. Now it
is Kalyuga, now in this, if you don’t do these things,

19:38.584 --> 19:41.625
so how will it happen? This has to be done,
this Kali Yuga has come.

19:43.038 --> 19:48.655
In this, if you do not move on this path, then no
work is going to be done. This is the way. It is Kaliyuga.

19:48.655 --> 19:57.996
No matter how you keep turning your path in Kalyug,
whichever way you go, somehow you keep on moving
right-left, somehow you keep living.

19:57.996 --> 20:07.128
Such a person lives on compromises because
the values which were stable, they finish off.

20:08.048 --> 20:12.678
When man becomes delusional, his constant/stable
values definitely end.

20:13.557 --> 20:20.227
When the war challenged and when the war broke out
in the European countries, when there was
great plight of the people,

20:20.270 --> 20:24.920
so the values that were there, were greatly reduced,
were over, almost finished.

20:27.310 --> 20:32.733
Because when everything started to waver/stagger,
then people could not understand that what
should they hold on to now.

20:32.755 --> 20:36.465
If they hold on to this thing, it is wobbly
if they held on to that thing, it wobbled.

20:37.445 --> 20:45.404
But then these thoughts should come to the mind of man,
that we may be we have not caught the thing
which is stable and immovable.

20:45.404 --> 20:50.804
Such a thought must arise in the mind of every
intellectualist - this thought must arise in the mind.

20:50.804 --> 20:58.123
Son, sit here, it is very cold there, come here.
There is a lot of space here. It's cold outside,
don't sit outside. Come sit here, don't sit outside.

20:59.006 --> 21:04.446
Come ahead and sit here. You people come forward.
I can't talk comfortably if everyone will sit outside.

21:04.446 --> 21:09.986
Sit here, what’s the problem? Spread something on it -
this is a good thing. Don't sit outside.

21:30.605 --> 21:43.505
And seeing all this, the heart of man gets
filled with bitterness. His heart becomes very bitter
- he wonders where is the sweetness,

21:45.807 --> 21:52.237
where is the love! If one has to live somehow
then what is home?

21:55.152 --> 21:58.892
Some strangle themselves, some strangle others.

22:01.279 --> 22:05.329
And in response thousands of people
will tell you thousands of things.

22:06.267 --> 22:11.167
Some will say that the reason for this is social disorder,
some would say political disorder.

22:11.167 --> 22:17.090
Some will say Communism is good, some will say
Capitalism is good, someone will say something good,
someone will say something else good.

22:19.146 --> 22:24.076
And people will also stick to it. Some will become
a Communist, someone will become a Capitalist,

22:24.076 --> 22:27.825
some will become Democratic, some Socialist,
then someone will become poor,

22:27.825 --> 22:32.475
somebody will become rich - means by forming some or
the other group will think that they can live as a group.

22:32.475 --> 22:42.995
and struggle, complete struggle and this struggle
also, they don't know what they want.

22:44.416 --> 22:53.586
There is a Dalit party, someone is a terrorist party
a number of parties have been changed.

22:55.133 --> 23:00.983
But among ourselves we are all human beings -
how did these parties come into being?

23:04.758 --> 23:21.588
There is a huge mystery behind this.
And the secret is that we cannot see the
love of that Supreme Father.

23:23.801 --> 23:29.601
We do not understand with how much love
He has created this Universe.

23:30.665 --> 23:41.245
You people can't make a tree out of a seed,
cannot make a fruit from a flower.

23:47.036 --> 23:55.496
There is nothing you can do. Just think,
how much beauty God has given us

23:58.020 --> 24:01.170
and how much He has done for us.

24:04.673 --> 24:13.703
This, man has forgotten, that the One who made us,
nurtured us - made a human-being from an amoeba,

24:14.639 --> 24:23.199
there is no gratitude towards Him, there is no attention
there is no thought towards Him,

24:24.756 --> 24:34.896
that's why incompleteness has come. And whatever was said
by those people, whatever was told to the other people, either
those who followed them, followed them wrongly.

24:34.896 --> 24:42.706
They made groups out of them and some people said
that, “These are all useless things, there is no
meaning in them - everything is false.”

24:47.744 --> 24:55.193
In such a situation when a person is completely disappointed
and desperate, and full of bitterness,

24:55.503 --> 24:59.353
and in his sight there is no glimpse of the love of God.

24:59.353 --> 25:07.653
Look in front of Me now, little-little leaves are visible
through the fog - how beautiful everything is made.

25:07.653 --> 25:17.320
It’s joy is pouring within. And all this beauty
of creation has also disappeared from our eyes

25:17.503 --> 25:27.133
and we are burdened with a heavy life,
then we do not understand, why is it so?

25:27.988 --> 25:35.778
If God made us with His love, cherished us with
so much joy, He created this universe,

25:35.778 --> 25:39.624
then after all, why did we get trapped
in such a big trouble?

25:44.082 --> 25:50.892
The reason for this is that we ourselves
have got our necks cut/landed up in trouble.

25:53.944 --> 26:02.624
Having necks cut - in Sahaja Yoga, what we call as
Vishuddhi Chakra, which is the place of Virata -

26:03.922 --> 26:08.652
having neck cut means that we have broken off
our relationship with the Virata.

26:08.715 --> 26:19.255
From that Primordial Being of which we are part and parcel,
which is known as God Almighty,
we have broken off our relationship with Him

26:20.856 --> 26:27.086
and have gone astray in our own direction, and in our
own notions and ideas and in our own thoughts,

26:27.386 --> 26:32.796
thinking that this is the only thing right, and
the rest everything that is there is wrong.

26:36.727 --> 26:43.767
At this juncture only, today Sahaja Yoga
has come before you as a Maha Yoga.

26:47.150 --> 26:55.080
You cannot know it by thinking about it, because
I already said that by thinking, you will find
only the thing that is lower than you.

26:55.284 --> 27:04.294
What is higher than you, is the stuff of your imagination.
In your imagination you can think that we are roaming
in the sky, anything, but that is not the reality.

27:06.562 --> 27:15.922
That’s not real, it is not reality, it is not real.
It should be accepted that whatever we think,
that we are such and such,

27:15.922 --> 27:24.541
and this will happen, that will happen, is not real. Then this
must be understood that what we actually found,

27:24.541 --> 27:30.310
found only that which is lower than ourselves, and if
we have to find something that is higher than
ourselves, something has to be there in reality.

27:34.608 --> 27:39.948
And also what should there be in reality,
the Creator has thought about it.

27:41.760 --> 27:50.430
Only He is the doer. He also has the idea/concept. The One
who gave you these eyes, nose, mouth, everything, this body,

27:50.494 --> 28:01.674
mind, intellect, ego, etc all things are given in you,
He will also give you that peg, upon reaching which
you can come to a higher state than this.

28:03.379 --> 28:07.439
With this thought only He has made you a human-being.

28:08.713 --> 28:13.773
But first of all, the intellectual has to think
how far does this intellect reach?

28:13.780 --> 28:20.930
What a limited thing it is, and when it comes to the
unlimited, it is not right to rub the intellect between.

28:25.637 --> 28:33.997
After knowing this infinite, after recognizing it,
as Nanak Saheb has said 'after recognizing it'

28:37.810 --> 28:46.260
then you can understand what are you,
why have you come into this world,

28:46.831 --> 28:54.311
and what work does this living Power of the
All-pervading Lord do, and how does It do it?

28:54.311 --> 29:04.101
Not only this, when the realization of the Spirit within you
happens, then this Power flows from within you
and is manifested.

29:04.101 --> 29:16.161
You must pay attention to this word. This Power doesn’t
speak, doesn’t think, it acts, is manifested.

29:18.480 --> 29:23.060
To speak and to think, is the work of the intellect -
useless – no work is done by it.

29:23.060 --> 29:26.958
Just as you sit in the car and start thinking about it
- will your car move?

29:29.722 --> 29:39.242
Something has to be done. But this Power is such that when
it starts flowing from within you, then it is manifested,

29:39.247 --> 29:45.157
it works. As there is light, it is implemented.
When light is coming from it, then light is visible,

29:45.157 --> 29:51.544
is working, is automatic. Despite doing nothing,
being light it is giving light.

29:53.594 --> 30:02.424
Similarly, such a person, while doing nothing,
can give light and is implemented.

30:04.085 --> 30:12.395
This thing, I think, is said in/for the university because
because the meaning of university is Universal.

30:13.623 --> 30:19.833
But intelligence cannot be universal.
If it had been, it would have happened by now.

30:19.833 --> 30:25.228
Everyone's intellect moves to the same place.
one does not match the other.

30:30.078 --> 30:36.398
So in order to achieve this thing, first
of all, we must humbly admit

30:36.398 --> 30:47.169
that whatever we have known so far is limited,
and in order to know the unlimited, some
happening must take place within us,

30:48.566 --> 30:58.466
some sprouting must take place within us, because today
that we seem so limited, we may become vast like the sky
and cover everything.

31:00.531 --> 31:05.871
In many ways have the elders tried to explain
that the drop should be the ocean.

31:07.849 --> 31:15.009
Now all similies that are there, also the analogies, are
also with the lower things. It’s a very big question

31:16.152 --> 31:23.582
from where to get that also because they can’t
even talk of higher things and those who give
analogies will do with lower things.

31:23.582 --> 31:28.059
And whatever lower things they will give,
will pull you further down.

31:28.059 --> 31:33.982
As soon as is said that, 'You become an ocean from a drop,’
they will say, 'Sir, how can we become an ocean from a drop?'

31:38.250 --> 31:45.110
No matter in whatever roundabout way it is explained,
it cannot be understood, because the one who wants
to understand, is a type of the intellect itself.

31:47.753 --> 31:54.613
When understanding is possible only through the Spirit, then
you tell Me, what can be explained through the intellect.

31:56.949 --> 32:06.039
Like many foreign Sahaja Yogis have come here,
they don’t even know the basic notes of your music -

32:06.681 --> 32:15.161
they know everything about their music. They don't know
anything about your musicology, don’t know
the names of your ragas

32:15.161 --> 32:23.394
but if any pure Indian classical music is played,
no matter how difficult the melody, they get
engrossed in that.

32:25.202 --> 32:33.942
They don't search it’s melody, they don't talk about
it’s aalaapa, but its effect, its work,
develops within them.

32:36.193 --> 32:41.213
Otherwise, if our Indians sit to listen to it, then
first they will ask, "Who’s the one singing, sir?"

32:44.523 --> 32:53.966
Then, 'Which melody is this,' thought comes in between.
To which family does it belong, what is it’s lineage,
(which theka is being used),

32:54.084 --> 33:00.174
but the one who is not particular about this thing,
is just experiencing it with his Spirit,

33:00.174 --> 33:09.187
enjoying it, and the reason for which that melody was created,
that joy, is being absorbed by that person.

33:09.187 --> 33:16.245
The joy with which it was made, that entire bliss,
is being absorbed in him and is manifesting.

33:19.710 --> 33:31.530
All this joy can be experienced by you all
- it's our own. If you say, I will also accept this fact.

33:31.530 --> 33:38.235
If you say, “Why only I’m doing this work?” then I’ll say,
you do it, it’s very good, you must certainly do it.

33:38.235 --> 33:42.278
Then I’m very happy that you people do it,
it’s very good - anyone may do it.

33:42.278 --> 33:47.294
What can be better than this, that someone else should
do the work instead of Me, that's a very good thing.

33:47.453 --> 33:52.413
But it is such, that perhaps I will have to do
this work, for a few days at least.

33:54.319 --> 33:56.819
If you can do it, then you do.

33:57.388 --> 34:07.018
The work is complicated, it is the work of love.
And love is Truth and Truth is love.

34:09.905 --> 34:16.925
This is such a deep love, that in it man immediately
recognizes, what is the problem with others.

34:19.094 --> 34:25.834
There is not the other, it is such an intense love
– everyone is part and parcel of our being.

34:26.598 --> 34:30.568
When there is not the other, whom
are you going to oblige?

34:35.549 --> 34:43.889
And when this love shines on anyone,
then the whole Truth of that person,
the complete is visible (in front).

34:47.833 --> 34:55.033
The whole thing, the complete picture comes
to the fore. In that light you come to know,

34:55.033 --> 35:01.091
what is the trouble in the one who is your
part and parcel – it manifests.(implemented)

35:01.313 --> 35:07.423
You must see in the light of the Spirit, clearly
it should be visible, there should be no mistake in it.

35:07.423 --> 35:15.446
Not just one, everyone who will see, will say the
same thing, that Mother is wearing a white saree.

35:16.802 --> 35:27.752
There can’t be many thoughts in it, there can be no
question of any quarrel in it - there can only be one Truth.

35:29.994 --> 35:35.774
And the only one Truth that is, in spite of
being many, looks the same though.

35:39.620 --> 35:46.862
But no one has known this love till date.
Very few have known, and those who have known,
no one wanted to know.

35:47.558 --> 35:54.649
They harassed them, tormented them and after
their death erected temples, churches,

35:54.649 --> 36:03.690
and set up various gurudwaras, and all other things,
but did not know(feel) that love, which was the
basis of all these things.

36:07.980 --> 36:14.300
In order to know that love, we will
have to depend on the Spirit.

36:15.739 --> 36:26.219
Just as we rely on intelligence to know worldly things,
in the same way we have to rely on the Spirit
to know Supernatural(Divine) things.

36:27.231 --> 36:39.721
Now someone will say whether there is the Spirit or not.
Why have you already started quarrelling?
Why is there such a fuss about it already?

36:40.862 --> 36:46.302
At least see whether it is or not. Now I
have come to prove it.

36:46.302 --> 36:52.230
You could say about the people of the past whether they were true,
or fake - you can say many things about them.

36:54.144 --> 37:00.540
But now I have come to prove it to you,
that within you is the seat of the Spirit

37:00.540 --> 37:07.985
and the Divine, omnipresent Lord
invites you to His kingdom.

37:10.626 --> 37:17.886
This All-Pervading Power is the wave of
love of our Almighty Supreme Father.

37:20.966 --> 37:32.896
Our Almighty Lord has created human-beings only to enjoy it.
Ego may delight a man but he can’t have joy, bliss.

37:32.896 --> 37:42.520
Happiness can be followed by sadness, but in joy
both the feelings of happiness and sorrow are broken and
there is only joy,

37:42.520 --> 37:46.647
which cannot be described in words,
can only be experienced.

37:47.188 --> 37:51.478
But even it’s experience is not from this heart
which you call as heart.

37:55.387 --> 38:01.937
It should not be called the heart because if this is
the heart, then it sometimes makes us cry, sometimes laugh.

38:05.450 --> 38:23.855
‘Hrid’- The one who knows - it is the Spirit. From the word ‘Ri’,
the meaning of ‘Ri’ is energy. Ra, ra, ra, means energy,
power. The One which gives this power of love, is the heart.

38:26.231 --> 38:35.361
Therefore the Spirit, which is giver of the power
of love, or is the knower, should be attained.

38:38.134 --> 38:44.124
So far, if all of you intellectuals reach/come down,
then I can talk of something further.

38:47.391 --> 38:54.101
First come down to this much - it is a very important thing -
because otherwise your intelligence will stand up in between

38:54.101 --> 39:04.991
that, "But Mother, how is it like this." On the
level of the intellect whatever reply I give,
you will not be satisfied.

39:05.159 --> 39:13.569
because it won’t be a complete answer. Although
logically I have brought you to that point
where you will say that,

39:13.569 --> 39:20.397
"Well then, tell me Mother, how to get this Spirit?"
I hope that in all of you

39:20.397 --> 39:26.579
there may have been such a feeling, that whatever
Mother says, there is some truth in it.

39:29.301 --> 39:35.671
Now you’ve asked to speak in English, so if someone
asks questions, I’ll reply in English.

40:02.438 --> 40:06.170
Ask questions, ask anything, you people
are very learned.

40:18.350 --> 40:22.540
Sahaja Yogi: What is the Spirit? What is the Spirit?

40:23.350 --> 40:25.825
Shri Mataji: What are you saying?
Sahaja Yogi: What is the Spirit?

40:27.544 --> 40:39.534
Shri Mataji: Spirit is the shadow of that Supreme Lord.
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,
which may be visible in this human being.

40:41.369 --> 40:54.117
Is the reflection. It is a reflection of God Almighty
in our heart. If the heart is a good ...

40:54.117 --> 40:59.727
[ASIDE - Yes this is better. If it’s a little
lukewarm, then will drink it. No tea.]

41:00.452 --> 41:05.902
If the heart is clean, like a clean mirror,
the reflection is the best.

41:07.152 --> 41:12.142
It's just simple thing, is the reflection of
God Almighty within ourselves.

41:15.116 --> 41:21.476
Seeker: Mother, please tell me whether Kundalini
and the Spirit, are both different things?
Shri Mataji: Okay child, sit down.

41:22.146 --> 41:26.736
Shri Mataji: She has asked Me a question -
Should I tell in English, child?

41:27.204 --> 41:29.871
Seeker: Please tell in Hindi.
Shri Mataji: In Hindi, okay.

41:31.109 --> 41:46.209
She has asked, what is the relationship between
Kundalini and the Spirit. Now I told you earlier,
that Spirit is the reflection of God.

41:46.411 --> 41:57.751
This is one thing. And the power of God,
is known as Adishakti, is called Holy Ghost,
or if you like/want, you can call it ‘Ruh’.

42:00.588 --> 42:06.178
The reflection of this power in a person
is the Kundalini.

42:07.634 --> 42:15.494
As long as these two things do not meet, yoga
doesn’t take place. Yoga means union (unison).

42:17.755 --> 42:27.045
And as soon as this thing happens,
then as if, you understand,

42:27.055 --> 42:32.476
I’ll give an analogy again in a very gross way -
which is a very low/inferior thing -

42:32.539 --> 42:46.609
that as soon as this is connected to the mains,
then just by plugging it into the plug,
it’s connection is established -

42:47.082 --> 42:53.582
so in this we can say, that Kundalini is this,
and the plug is the Spirit.

42:56.597 --> 43:05.557
Now it is a very gross thing, but what to do? Whatever
analogy is given, no matter how poetic it is made,
even then it will be inferior.

43:08.017 --> 43:11.277
There is such a close relationship between
the two/with each other.

43:15.708 --> 43:22.488
She asked me the question, what is the connection
between the Spirit and the Kundalini?

43:22.571 --> 43:34.801
I said, I was telling them in Hindi language a point,
that whatever we have to achieve or we achieve,

43:34.974 --> 43:49.644
or we describe, or talk about, is lower than us,
is not higher than us, because it is done through
our intelligence or through our emotions,

43:49.644 --> 43:54.759
so it's not higher than us, the whole thing
is lower than us, which we can handle.

43:56.593 --> 44:03.702
In imagination you may think of some greater things,
higher things, but this imagination that’s not reality.

44:03.712 --> 44:09.192
So in reality when have to deal with something, in reality

44:09.972 --> 44:13.642
then you deal with things that are lower than you.

44:17.742 --> 44:21.572
That's why many people say that,
"Mother, you are not practical."

44:23.203 --> 44:28.163
Many people say that, "Mother, you are
not practical," because to them it looks as if

44:28.479 --> 44:35.969
I have a very impractical attitude towards things,
because I must deal with the lower things.

44:35.969 --> 44:42.142
Like I said in Bombay that, "I will not pay any black money
or anything. If I don't get the land, doesn't matter."

44:42.442 --> 44:47.432
So they thought I was not practical.
I must say that you should pay them.

44:47.432 --> 44:53.993
By God’s grace, some man donated us one acre
of land, without even paying a single pie.

44:58.448 --> 45:03.448
Sahaja Yogi: There’s another question Mother.
Why is man afraid of the dark?

45:04.232 --> 45:06.742
Shri Mataji: Not all human beings feel.

45:08.564 --> 45:16.164
There’s a question - ‘Why a man is afraid of darkness?’
Not all.... Darkness is sometimes afraid of some men.

45:23.151 --> 45:34.201
This thing is not right. The question is incomplete son.
But one is afraid because - the same thing has come,
hasn't it? That a person is afraid of the invisible.

45:35.292 --> 45:40.522
And in the darkness, the mess that humans have done
on each other, that's why they’re afraid of it.

45:40.522 --> 45:48.373
There are many other things, but the main thing is this
that, when there is darkness inside a man, then
he’s very scared.

45:49.250 --> 45:54.610
When he comes into the light, he’s never
afraid of the dark and darkness.

45:55.762 --> 46:02.412
It's dark inside, dark outside, so there’s too much
darkness. Man gets nervous

46:02.412 --> 46:07.379
that, 'Oh my God, as it is can’t find the way
and on top of it so much darkness.’

46:09.900 --> 46:16.250
But when there is light inside, the outside
darkness is no longer visible.

46:16.250 --> 46:21.298
You think it's dark now, and I'm seeing
very beautiful things in it also.

46:23.428 --> 46:32.218
Seeker: There are such big-big universities
inside our country and even outside, and the
Government also spends so much money

46:32.218 --> 46:38.267
and all the other people together and so many students
are engaged in it, day and night work laboriously

46:38.267 --> 46:42.614
and achieve something. According to You it
is inferior, of a lower level?

46:42.614 --> 46:45.746
Shri Mataji: Absolutely.
Seeker: So this system that You have made,

46:45.746 --> 46:49.477
for it’s arrangement, if there’s any provision
or system, can it not be given?

46:49.477 --> 46:55.585
Suppose someone is curious, has a desire to know,
and even if he’s not, then curiosity/inquisitiveness
could be created in him.

46:55.585 --> 47:02.424
And to turn people that way too, some ashram system
or something of this type that was told before,
such arrangement is there.

47:02.424 --> 47:07.580
Shri Mataji: I am telling about that condition only.
that they went to buy land for the ashram, then the
authorities started saying, "Give black money."

47:07.580 --> 47:13.253
Then they started saying, ‘You give bribe,’ -
while doing all this, 12 years have passed.
Now a gentleman has given the land.

47:13.253 --> 47:21.814
Your President gave us land because I cured him. Thus
they gave us land in the vegetable market where bulls sit.

47:23.195 --> 47:28.640
That's correct. You go and ask. Very peculiar,
insane people roam around the world, tell me.

47:28.738 --> 47:37.185
Now they’ve given in the vegetable market. To this also
four years have passed. From the vegetable market
they took us here and there - this is what is going on.

47:37.185 --> 47:42.475
As long as man's intellect is not proper, till then
I don't think even an ashram will be built.

47:43.218 --> 47:51.068
Ashrams can be built only when people think that they
are needed. Otherwise only deserted universities
will be made here and no one will come in it at all.

47:51.595 --> 47:56.595
That's why, first it should strike a little in
man's brain - it should definitely ring in,

47:56.595 --> 48:02.364
and that's why it will strike man in Kaliyuga only,
otherwise, this thing will not come to his mind.

48:02.834 --> 48:07.514
By explaining like this, no one will understand. You tell Me,
today so many of you people are sitting here,

48:07.514 --> 48:14.699
how many learned people of this university are sitting here,
I mean, not professors but college boys are sitting

48:17.439 --> 48:27.579
Look, is there anyone - one, two, three, four, five, that's it.
Six - six children are sitting - you tell

48:28.246 --> 48:37.156
what should I do now? This university, in this Delhi University
for how many years I have been coming here, let me
tell you - for about 11-12 years.

48:37.156 --> 48:47.615
Got six children in twelve years, now tell?
What should I do, son - from My side I’m working very hard.

48:47.615 --> 49:01.816
Working tirelessly day and night but nobody comes here.
Then if it’s Delhi University, the condition is even worse.

49:03.010 --> 49:09.310
And that which is your Jawaharlal Nehru University,
in that only one person came to listen to my lecture.

49:09.811 --> 49:18.001
I just spoke to the walls.
There is absolutely a great need.

49:18.001 --> 49:24.741
Unless these people are going to get into a lot of
trouble, till then, wisdom will not come into them.

49:25.155 --> 49:32.575
Like, we have a lot of work being done abroad. At Cambridge
University, New York University, in Canada

49:32.575 --> 49:40.810
people are writing our thesis on Sahaja yoga, at three places.
Thesis is being written about Sahaja Yoga.

49:43.075 --> 49:51.165
Would anyone in Delhi University do such a thing?
Would anyone here agree, that on Sahaja Yoga a
thesis should be written.

49:51.165 --> 49:58.596
And even if they write, then such, so superficial,
that the work of Sahaja Yoga stops permanently.

49:59.800 --> 50:07.030
They will say that Mother was sitting down wearing
a white saree, or her so-and-so is this or that,

50:07.030 --> 50:12.370
anything, they will say things whatever superficially they
understand with their minds, as newspaper things go.

50:13.080 --> 50:17.560
Thus there’s a little need that it should hit/strike the
minds of the people here.

50:17.685 --> 50:22.565
Without that, they cannot become sane, I think so.

50:22.571 --> 50:27.741
Son, I’ve been coming here since twelve years, then this
is the condition; From this you can understand.

50:28.388 --> 50:33.478
Now from this you can understand that I have not
shirked from hard work.

50:34.721 --> 50:41.719
And there are many such people here who are realized.
130 people from abroad are also sitting here.

50:42.085 --> 50:46.965
The same number from here are also sitting.
If people from abroad didn’t come, then even
this space would not have been occupied/full.

50:49.509 --> 51:02.153
It is true. What should I do? People are not interested,
there’s no thought in this direction. They think
that they have become great people. What to say!

51:06.633 --> 51:14.963
Sahaja Yogi: There’s a gentleman who writes Mother,
"I failed to join your lectures on awakening of
Kundalini on Mooladhara and Sahasrara Chakras.

51:15.033 --> 51:24.725
Sahaja Yogi: My keen desire to learn the same by
tape recorder and I’m leaving to my native place
by 2nd or 3rd of this month.

51:24.725 --> 51:27.245
Shri Mataji: Who’s it?
Sahaja Yogi: Some gentleman.

51:27.245 --> 51:42.029
Shri Mataji: Who’s this gentleman? Alright. There is a
arrangement, that you can take my lectures, which is
taped and you can take from there. Alright?

51:42.071 --> 51:47.621
But you see, My lectures are of no use, if you
do not get your realization.

51:48.595 --> 51:54.505
It’s a good thing, you see, because Mother speaks
well, you see, She’s good at speaking,

51:54.505 --> 52:00.417
so nice to listen to Her but you must
get your realization first, alright?

52:00.417 --> 52:02.662
Seeker: (Unclear – I’ve taken?)
Shri Mataji: You got it? Then you take it

52:02.662 --> 52:07.339
Then it’s alright, then you are my son.
Alright? You take whatever you like.

52:10.327 --> 52:16.007
Sahaja Yogi: This same gentleman writes, " During my 30 years
of experience in religion and yoga, I have

52:16.037 --> 52:23.487
not seen such a eminent person who, who’s got a
vast knowledge of Kundalini. Before I left Delhi

52:23.487 --> 52:30.407
I wish to learn more about Sahaja Yoga and
treatment. I came to Delhi last December.

52:30.817 --> 52:35.967
Shri Mataji: To whom did he go?
Sahaja Yogi: To whom did you go first?

52:36.881 --> 52:41.661
Shri Mataji: Which eminent person did you visit?
Seeker: Mataji only

52:41.661 --> 52:44.183
Shri Mataji: Yes?
Seeker: You only, Mother.

52:44.183 --> 52:47.213
Shri Mataji: What? Which Mother?
Seeker: Went to You.

52:47.213 --> 52:50.246
Seeker: I’m telling about You Mother, I have learned from You only.
Shri Mataji: You learnt it from Me?

52:50.250 --> 52:53.262
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: You learnt it from Me?
Seeker: Yes.

52:53.262 --> 52:58.541
Shri Mataji: Then it’s alright.
Sahaja Yogi: He’s talking 30 years of
experience in religion and yoga.

52:58.541 --> 53:08.182
Shri Mataji: How did you get the experience of 30 years?
Hmm? I started my work only 12 years back.

53:09.294 --> 53:16.084
Sahaja Yogi: He worked overtime.
Shri Mataji: It’s alright, doesn’t matter but you better
take the taperecorder

53:16.084 --> 53:21.055
if you got your realization even today,
you can take it, alright? That's all.

53:21.055 --> 53:25.380
You see, because without Self-realization
it's just a tool in your hands,

53:25.380 --> 53:30.799
but once you get realized, it is a light in your
hands. Alright, that’s why. Give it to him.

53:31.132 --> 53:36.352
You can take. We have got arrangements. Those who
want to take My tapes, can take it.

53:36.352 --> 53:43.696
but you have to be a realized soul,
otherwise we don't give because what's the
use of this cheap popularity.

53:44.276 --> 53:50.176
There's no need to have cheap popularity about
Sahaja Yoga - you have to become.

53:50.176 --> 53:54.974
Here you cannot be just a member, we have no
membership, nothing – this is a living organism.

53:56.078 --> 54:01.988
So, if you become, you have every right
but if you don't become, you have no right.

54:03.651 --> 54:09.831
Just like, you have to be an Indian citizen to
have some rights in this country
– I wonder if we have any!

54:12.953 --> 54:22.763
But here in God’s, in the realm of God, if you
just enter into it, you have all the rights

54:23.050 --> 54:30.020
and He looks after you with every support, with
every help, so much so that you think you have

54:30.020 --> 54:39.385
now lost the meaning of miracles
- every step you will be amazed.

54:42.375 --> 54:46.735
Sahaja Yogi: The same person he has asked,
something about, how to cure insomnia?

54:46.735 --> 54:49.344
Shri Mataji: Kill what?
Sahaja Yogi: Insomnia
Shri Mataji: Insomnia, alright.

54:49.396 --> 54:53.856
Sahaja Yogi: and he says that, ‘I did not understand
last time because of 50% knowledge of Hindi.’

54:53.856 --> 55:00.363
Shri Mataji: Insomnia is absolutely curable. If you
have attended My lectures before this,

55:00.363 --> 55:04.077
I have told you how to give balance to yourself,
but in any case

55:04.077 --> 55:09.512
you come to the centre and they will tell you
how to cure insomnia. It’s absolutely simple.

55:12.904 --> 55:19.694
Sahaja Yogi: A boy has written that, ‘For the
realization of the Spirit whatever formula
or whatever we can do,

55:19.694 --> 55:25.566
please tell, so that that energy can synchronize
or resonate with my body.

55:25.566 --> 55:29.386
I am attending this discourse for the first time.
Shri Mataji: Huh?

55:29.386 --> 55:31.410
Sahaja Yogi: For the first time I have attended this discourse.
Shri Mataji: Okay

55:31.410 --> 55:37.343
Shri Mataji: Whose question is this?
Is it your son? It’s a matter of great happiness.

55:37.417 --> 55:42.507
He asked the correct thing that, ‘I want to
have Self-realization.’ It will be done.

55:42.507 --> 55:47.962
That's enough - it will happen. But when
this energy starts flowing through you

55:47.962 --> 55:57.041
then you have to learn about it, you have to know,
because the yoga has taken place but another meaning
of ‘yog’ is deftness/trick/tactics – skill.

55:57.041 --> 56:03.666
After knowing Yoga, you should understand,
it’s tactics, how is it to be worked out.

56:03.667 --> 56:07.867
Yoga does not have only one meaning. One meaning
of yoga is that union has taken place

56:07.867 --> 56:11.999
and after that it’s skill should come,
it’s deftness should come.

56:14.767 --> 56:20.887
Done? No?
Seeker: You told us the Spirit,

56:22.967 --> 56:29.661
You have told us Atma(Spirit) is Parmatma (Almighty God),
Atma is the reflection of God. Then why is it

56:29.661 --> 56:35.285
then somebody passes away, we pray,
"May God grant peace to the departed soul."

56:35.285 --> 56:39.439
As if God and Atma are two different things.
Shri Mataji: No

56:39.439 --> 56:41.889
Seeker: That is true God is Supreme,
we have to pray ….

56:41.889 --> 56:46.430
Shri Mataji: Alright, I’ll answer your question.
It’s not difficult to answer, because when you die,

56:46.430 --> 56:53.921
that time what happens to you is the part.
You just don’t only become the Atma, you become
the soul, you become a Jiva.

56:53.921 --> 57:02.036
So with the Atma, Jiva is still with it and that's why
there’s darkness, because if Jiva is surrounding the Atma,

57:02.036 --> 57:07.563
we say that, "Oh God, please give peace to this
Atma or to this Jivatma,”

57:07.563 --> 57:17.804
to his soul, not to his Atma, to his soul, to Jivatma
so that the person becomes a better person

57:17.804 --> 57:26.900
and when he is reborn, he doesn’t hanker. Even when
he’s dead, if his Jivatma is not happy or peaceful,

57:26.900 --> 57:33.838
he may hanker around, he may hover around, and may
create problems, that's why we say.

57:33.838 --> 57:40.745
Atma itself is shanti(peace) itself but it is the
Jivatma, it’s not the Atma.

57:40.869 --> 57:52.359
There are three elements still attached to the Atma.
Only the earth element and water element drop out.
The rest of it is still there.

57:55.757 --> 58:03.897
Seeker: Is it for this realization that You have told,
can a man who’s a householder's achieve all this?

58:03.897 --> 58:07.529
Shri Mataji: If a person is not a householder,
then there will be no realization.

58:07.529 --> 58:13.306
The opposite is the situation in Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga if
if you do not stay in Grihastha Ashram (family life), then
there would be no benefit of Sahaja Yoga.

58:13.478 --> 58:17.568
If there was a hermit, we would have told him,
‘Please change your clothes and come.’

58:20.232 --> 58:25.492
Family life is not to be abandoned at all
- don't know where all these ideas came from.

58:26.267 --> 58:29.317
This is escapism.

58:29.317 --> 58:33.560
Seeker: So much concentration, so much realization,
man does need solitude for all this.

58:33.560 --> 58:38.357
Shri Mataji: Not necessary. Everything is within, son.
There is no need of solitude.

58:38.439 --> 58:45.709
It takes place within, within yourself you find, and
in that you know that wherever you are sitting,

58:45.709 --> 58:51.786
in that environment only that power has come.
But if you go to the Himalayas,

58:51.786 --> 58:57.809
even after going there, you will remain worried.
And there too you would like to build something
around your hut

58:57.809 --> 59:06.214
and keep yourself safe somehow, but here when you
are awakened in the Spirit, then even being with
everyone, you remain calm inside.

59:09.133 --> 59:15.023
Seeker: For spiritual growth, a man who
drinks alcohol, smokes cigarettes, eats meat,

59:15.023 --> 59:22.364
and as in the Muslim religion there are four wives,
there’s only one in Hindu religion, then this, in
that manner human being is the same in the whole world.

59:22.750 --> 59:32.130
So many of these scholars have different views,
to enhance the powers of spiritual, spiritual development
(inaudible),

59:32.130 --> 59:34.939
Shri Mataji: No sir, not different notions

59:34.939 --> 59:40.955
Seeker: No, what is the difference in this? It’s said,
that one who smokes cigarettes is not good, eats meat
is not good,

59:40.955 --> 59:46.634
keeps five wives is not right – can’t have spiritual development
quickly - he himself

59:46.998 --> 59:49.088
Shri Mataji: I’ve understood, you sit down. I….

59:49.088 --> 59:51.933
Seeker: What about eating, drinking, wearing,
(inaudible).

59:51.933 --> 59:58.100
Shri Mataji: You please sit. See, those things
which are against the Spirit, should not be consumed.

59:58.466 --> 01:00:03.516
That which opposes the Spirit, or consciousness(awareness),
should not be done.

01:00:03.986 --> 01:00:10.771
Now when Mohammad Sahab came, he told,
"Please don't drink alcohol," because until
then cigarette hadn’t come.

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:14.737
That's why he came as Nanak Saheb and
said, "Please, don't smoke cigarettes now."

01:00:14.967 --> 01:00:19.409
So now some people come and tell me, these two
have not said that, "Don't smoke Ganja."

01:00:20.699 --> 01:00:25.519
So I told them that, see, you make a list of all the
things that can be drunk or smoked, and give it to Me

01:00:25.519 --> 01:00:29.374
- I don't even know what all can be drunk
and what can be done -

01:00:29.374 --> 01:00:33.639
I mean, it's something like this, isn't it?
['Come bull kill me,]' this policy.

01:00:33.646 --> 01:00:38.416
Sitting nicely, all of a sudden started
drinking, so what to say to them.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:44.528
But now supposing it may be, that I haven’t mentioned
one or two things and I left this world

01:00:44.528 --> 01:00:48.350
then people will say that, ‘Mataji
didn't disallow this thing, so do this only.’

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:55.418
Just understand, that the thing which goes against
our awareness, means

01:00:57.066 --> 01:01:03.896
that the alcohol you drink does it go against
your consciousness or not - straight calculation.

01:01:03.896 --> 01:01:09.993
Isn’t it, then don't do that. Smoking a cigarette,
doesn’t it cause cancer, it goes against your body.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:14.250
Now about eating meat nobody has said, 'Don't eat meat'

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:18.110
No one has said like this, 'Don't eat meat.'
These are made up things.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:23.593
Didn't say so, but this they have definitely said
that, ‘Whatever it is, eat balanced food.’

01:01:23.593 --> 01:01:33.803
If you are vegetarian, stay vegetarian.
But when people come upon eating meat, they
eat fish, chicken, horse, etc. every possible thing.

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:44.755
And when it comes to vegetarianism, then they go to such
extremes that, they will save bed bugs, mosquitoes,
there should be some point in doing so.

01:01:46.179 --> 01:01:52.619
Everything must have a reason. Does it mean anything,
like you understand there are some people

01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:58.280
that to mosquito – now, can I give realisation to a
mosquito? - a straight reckoning - can I give?

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.780
can it be given to bedbugs, given to chickens
- can't give.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:09.507
But a person should eat what he needs
according to his body requirements.

01:02:09.748 --> 01:02:14.658
but if people want to eat only dirty stuff,
what can you say?

01:02:14.658 --> 01:02:21.666
One should eat whatever suits him. Now it means
- Nanak Saheb was there, he used to eat meat.

01:02:22.716 --> 01:02:31.726
Kabirdas used to eat meat, our Mohammad Sahab
used to eat, Rama used to eat, Buddha also ate,

01:02:31.726 --> 01:02:38.129
and Mahavira also used to eat. But it was not
such with them that when they came upon eating,
then only (thought of eating)ate.

01:02:38.662 --> 01:02:45.963
Because eating and drinking then affects the Spirit,
when such tendencies come within you,

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:53.840
that you become violent. And it affects also
when you just become lazy – like cabbages.

01:02:55.326 --> 01:03:01.416
Some people are there, who become just as if they
have absolutely no strength in them.

01:03:01.426 --> 01:03:05.132
Now you will see that diseases also
come from extreme tendencies.

01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:11.573
People who eat a lot of meat are oppressive,
they are arrogant.

01:03:11.573 --> 01:03:15.876
And what diseases come in them?
Such people may have high blood pressure,

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:23.220
can have a heart attack due to overactivity.
And supposing those who live only on grass,

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.180
they get all lethargies, they have(get) lethargic heart.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:34.962
A gentleman had come today itself - he was Agarwal.
Poor thing, he said that he had lethargic heart,
lethargic liver, lethargic intestines.

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:40.110
So I said, see you can’t eat meat
because you've never eaten

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:48.620
but what you should do is to eat more protein.
So, "Where's the protein, Mother?" I said you
can get it, look for it. You can't eat any more,

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:53.758
you’ve eaten a lot of it. You shouldn’t eat carbohydrates.
This is a thing/matter to be explained.

01:03:53.758 --> 01:04:04.549
Now someone has said that it is written in Gita.
However, I would only say that in Gita, Krishna said
right in the beginning,"Arjuna, you kill all of them."

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:09.459
He didn't even talk of non-violence, means,
don't know how He was brought/put into non-violence.

01:04:09.524 --> 01:04:15.224
He’s told to kill a human being, leave alone an
animal, and above it all, even to kill the Guru.

01:04:15.234 --> 01:04:20.762
So how will he say, "You don't kill this, don’t kill that."
He‘s said in the beginning that, ‘Everyone is dead.’

01:04:21.947 --> 01:04:27.117
Such opposite things have also happened everywhere.
In the Bible also they’ve done many mistakes.

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:33.356
Such things have been done in the Quran too
- this is everyone's business, because if they
don't do this, how will they manage.

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:41.301
They make something like that, that something
or the other becomes a group.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:50.800
All these that are, have made groups. A thing to
understand is, that which goes contrary to our
consciousness(awareness), all alcohol etc. goes against.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:56.267
That's why everyone has spoken against alcohol, even Moses.
Now you will say that Jesus did not say,

01:04:56.267 --> 01:05:02.840
but it’s not like that. Jesus Christ is born here,
and at this place something else had to be done.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:09.082
Wherever what is to be said, that only will be talked about.
Now if I have come for the awakening of Kundalini,
then I will talk about it only to you.

01:05:09.264 --> 01:05:17.854
But this time is such that I have to talk about everything,
otherwise I'm afraid, that whatever I don’t talk about today,
you will keep holding on to that only.

01:05:17.854 --> 01:05:23.786
Thus it’s better I talk about all the things, but
even then, those of you have to catch, will catch.

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:28.080
Those who have only one work from morning to evening
to point out/catch - loop holes which are called -

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:39.014
like, now if someone goes to a thief and asks
about a bank, then he will tell that how
you can get into it - clearly.

01:05:39.014 --> 01:05:44.728
But if you ask it’s manager, he will say,
see, there is strength in this, that is strong.

01:05:45.036 --> 01:05:52.146
But only a thief can tell how you can enter in,
no matter how strong you make it, even then
they will show you by entering it.

01:05:52.146 --> 01:06:00.103
This is the quality of man. Every religious preacher
has tried his best to bring man to sense.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:06.585
Now Mahavirji has been taken to such an extent that
now bedbugs ... bedbug - brought one,

01:06:06.585 --> 01:06:12.236
a Brahmin, told him that, ‘We’ll put bugs on you
and will give you this much money.’

01:06:12.339 --> 01:06:18.849
Then when those bedbugs suck his blood, the Brahmin
is allowed to go - thus a great religious work has been done.

01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:24.698
‘We fed so many bedbugs with the blood
of a Brahmin.’ Now is this any way?

01:06:28.293 --> 01:06:44.273
Man has a lot of sense but very less in the
matter of religion. And to think too much
of food is also not correct.

01:06:44.273 --> 01:06:50.122
You tell Me, the person who thinks day and night
only about eating and drinking, how will he
achieve the Spirit?

01:06:50.122 --> 01:06:54.998
Now if one is to fast, so the person will keep
thinking about it only, as to what they
will have tomorrow when they fast.

01:06:54.998 --> 01:07:00.059
And there’ll be so much commotion – as if
Shri Hanumana has incarnated – that it’s their fast.

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:05.648
It can be known from a distance that there is
someone fasting. God save us from such people.

01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:10.041
In Sahaja Yoga there’s a rule that no one
will fast in the name of God.

01:07:10.041 --> 01:07:15.117
If you want to do it for yourself then do it but the
man who will fast, should go out of the village

01:07:15.117 --> 01:07:19.484
because no one should listen to them.
Here, everyone has a sense of martyrdom,

01:07:19.484 --> 01:07:23.584
"I’ve fasted so much, so I can trouble everyone."

01:07:23.584 --> 01:07:26.753
"I’ve sacrificed so much for the country,
so I can annoy/distress everyone."

01:07:26.773 --> 01:07:35.946
Why did you do, who told you? That too is a
martyrdom, just a mental projection.
Done is done - live in peace.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:51.010
So the idea of excessive eating and drinking
is also not correct. But get your realization
first, then we'll talk.

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:55.060
Because in doing now, you’ll rely on the logic
of the intellect, so first get your realization.

01:07:55.176 --> 01:08:01.056
There’s no compulsion of anything for eating
and drinking but don't eat the animals
that are bigger than us.

01:08:01.204 --> 01:08:07.274
And in Sahaja Yoga it is not that all of you
should eat meat or you have to eat this only
- whatever you are eating is fine.

01:08:07.274 --> 01:08:11.505
Don't eat too much - eat less but not so little
that you starve.

01:08:11.505 --> 01:08:16.755
Be in the centre, is the middle path.
Don't take an extreme view of anything.

01:08:19.293 --> 01:08:23.883
You keep your diet according to the disease.

01:08:23.883 --> 01:08:30.392
I will only speak on this, who has to eat protein,
who has to eat carbohydrates, and who has to eat fats.

01:08:31.047 --> 01:08:35.587
Did you understand, and on this you decide
whichever type of food you want to eat.

01:08:35.587 --> 01:08:40.609
Too much thinking about it, the attention and
mind of our Indians is only on food.

01:08:40.609 --> 01:08:45.559
This is also the matter. Indians think a lot about food.
Don't know why all day and night they think

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:52.687
so much of food and throw a lot of tantrums while/in eating.
In no country have I seen people with so many tantrums
as there are in India.

01:08:52.687 --> 01:09:01.291
And though, so to say, we are poor people, but the
tantrums of Indians, you won't find such people
anywhere, (as Indians)how much we fuss about it.

01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:07.255
The woman is, she is also smart. She too makes different
varieties of food and spoils the tongue(taste) of man

01:09:08.085 --> 01:09:13.615
because it’s a good way to call back her man home
- first spoil his tongue.

01:09:13.629 --> 01:09:19.359
When he’s under her control, then he
runs back, for the taste of his tongue.

01:09:19.497 --> 01:09:23.957
And so many tantrums with respect to food,
that I can't tell you.

01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:30.309
As it is now in Bengal, they will eat Rohu fish.
Rohu is not found there, then they will eat Rohu -
they’ll eat only what is not available.

01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:36.706
And that goes from Central India. Once Rohu fish
was not found there - means in their place
it can be found in small-small ponds -

01:09:37.556 --> 01:09:45.336
so they started dying of hunger. Then some people
from our Bombay collected a lot of money
and sent a whole ship full.

01:09:45.336 --> 01:09:50.379
They sent it back, that, ‘We don’t eat sea fish.’
Look at their greatness!

01:09:51.475 --> 01:09:55.225
And all of the ships they came back
- 'We cannot eat sea fish.'

01:09:55.225 --> 01:10:01.736
Go and see anywhere there’s no one like this in the world,
the one who doesn't eat sea fish - he eats this fish.

01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:06.871
Sitting down to eat, this is needed, that is needed, salt
is not proper in it - all this does not happen anywhere.

01:10:06.871 --> 01:10:12.878
This is in our own country only and so much
are we fond of food, there is no limit to it.

01:10:12.878 --> 01:10:16.848
That's why, just for a while, you forget about eating.

01:10:16.848 --> 01:10:20.598
After a while it'll be dinner time - now is not the time.

01:10:22.606 --> 01:10:29.696
Sahaja Yogi: Is Truth beyond the sense perception
or is Truth whatever we perceive and whatever
we do not perceive?

01:10:29.862 --> 01:10:36.562
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s correct. This is a very good
question - is Truth beyond sense perception?

01:10:36.767 --> 01:10:47.257
It is absolutely. Because if we perceive through
our senses whatever we perceive, through our senses

01:10:47.257 --> 01:11:04.570
is the truth, then we don’t have to seek any more.
Whatever we perceive through our senses, is
what is very apparent, gross - not the subtle.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.299
What is behind the gross we cannot perceive.

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:14.242
For example, we cannot say how to make an atom.

01:11:18.194 --> 01:11:23.504
We cannot say how an amoeba is made
into a human-being.

01:11:23.504 --> 01:11:30.375
We cannot make one monkey into a human-being
- can we – through our perception of the senses

01:11:30.601 --> 01:11:44.971
Through our perception of the senses we cannot do
the subtle thing which is behind the gross. So
we cannot perceive through the senses

01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:48.875
but once you have perceived it you can feel
it through your senses.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:57.940
This is the second point. Done now? I think,
let us have meditation first.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.613
What’s the question?

01:11:59.613 --> 01:12:07.483
Seeker: What one shall do or practice,
no.1, for purification of his mind of thoughts,

01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:11.369
no.2, for shedding complex within oneself

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:15.934
Shri Mataji: Alright.
Seeker: and no.3, for creating self-confidence in himself.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:23.587
Shri Mataji: It’s very good question. Sit down.
Now, you have to just get to your Spirit(Atma).
You have to become your Spirit.

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:31.128
That once happens to you, the first thing that
happens actually when the Kundalini rises,

01:12:31.128 --> 01:12:36.064
when She crosses this Agnya chakra, you get
Nirvichara Samadhi(thoughtless awareness),
you get beyond thoughts.

01:12:36.064 --> 01:12:49.503
That’s first thing happens. Then, how to
get your confidence? Atma is your confidence, because
so far you have not known your properties,

01:12:49.522 --> 01:12:54.442
You have not known your wealth, you have not known
your beauties, your glories.

01:12:54.442 --> 01:13:00.250
Only through the eyes of the Atma, when you’ll
discover how tremendous you are, you will know it.

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:07.763
For example, till this instrument is not connected
to the mains, it has no meaning, it is zero,
it has no value.

01:13:07.763 --> 01:13:12.918
But once it is connected, it has the value. In the same way,
you are connected to the mains, you have your own value.

01:13:12.918 --> 01:13:20.998
When you know your value, your whole value system
changes and you evaluate it yourself in a different way,

01:13:20.998 --> 01:13:25.409
that you know you are the Spirit. That’s how
you get your confidence.

01:13:25.409 --> 01:13:30.274
Now the purification part of it, that also without
the light you cannot purify yourself.

01:13:30.659 --> 01:13:37.139
Whatever purification you do in darkness, one side you
may be cleansing, another side you may be dirty.

01:13:37.139 --> 01:13:41.853
It happens very much in life. See, some people
say, "I’m going to conquer my ego.”

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:44.936
You cannot conquer it. You go on fighting with it, you see.

01:13:44.936 --> 01:13:49.283
It fights with you and if you try to put down
your ego, you get your super ego.

01:13:49.283 --> 01:13:52.273
Means, you get a meek person,
you become like a cabbage.

01:13:52.273 --> 01:13:55.293
Either you become this or that
- you cannot be in the centre.

01:13:55.293 --> 01:14:03.218
Now with Kundalini what happens. When She raises, comes
up here – at this point when it is awakened, this centre,

01:14:03.228 --> 01:14:09.184
it sucks in, it sucks in from both the sides,
your ego and your super ego.

01:14:09.184 --> 01:14:13.640
both the things - your conditionings, your sins and
everything and on the other side your ego,

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:18.336
both are sucked in. Once it is sucked in
immediately what happens,

01:14:18.336 --> 01:14:25.767
that your Sahastrara is open - this part, the fontanel bone
area and the Brahmarandhra opens in and you
enter into that subtle awareness.

01:14:26.877 --> 01:14:32.747
So, all the so-called karmas and all things are sucked in.
After all, who does the karma - is the ego.

01:14:32.747 --> 01:14:41.736
Once it is sucked in, there is no ego left.
In that egolessness you become one with God.
So, it is a spontaneous, automatic happening.

01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:49.664
As a result of the Kundalini awakening,
all these things happen immediately.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.866
Sahaja Yogi: What was the Soul before entering the body?
Shri Mataji: Huh/What?

01:14:59.866 --> 01:15:05.039
Sahaja Yogi: What was the Soul before entering
the body and what happens to it after death?

01:15:05.039 --> 01:15:11.638
Shri Mataji: Now he's wants to ask - he’s asking that,
what is the Soul before the birth and what is the Soul after?

01:15:11.638 --> 01:15:19.227
Son, just now you're a human being, alright? Just now
you should not worry about these things.

01:15:19.677 --> 01:15:23.287
Everything you cannot know in one lecture,
- can you?

01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:29.521
So now, don't worry about these things.
Why worry about the past or the future?

01:15:29.521 --> 01:15:39.507
because the past is finished (ASIDE - What? Having tea)
The past is finished and the future doesn’t exist.

01:15:39.507 --> 01:15:45.558
So we have to be in the present. Now, how to
be in the present? Just now, if I say, pay
attention to yourself - can you pay attention?

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:53.765
That’s why, let the Kundalini rise, you get
your realization, then we’ll talk of the past and
the future. Just now you get the present.

01:15:58.462 --> 01:16:03.512
Sahaja Yogi: Last question, Mother. According to You,
the Spirit and Divine unite through Sahaja Yoga.

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:10.569
If this happens, then why did our saints, sages etc.
go to a secluded place on the Himalayan Mountains
