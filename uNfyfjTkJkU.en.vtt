00:01:05.488 --> 00:01:11.518
Today we have gathered here to worship the Adi Kundalini

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:14.263
and your own Kundalini, both of them,

00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:18.193
because your Kundalini is the reflection

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:20.153
of the Adi Kundalini.

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:25.093
We have understood a lot

00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:28.253
about Kundalini

00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:34.093
and also we know that

00:01:34.153 --> 00:01:36.283
through Her awakening only,

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:38.263
through Her ascent only,

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.153
we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:51.253
It's not only that we have risen to a very higher realm

00:01:51.293 --> 00:01:54.313
of awareness

00:01:54.961 --> 00:02:01.113
but that it has granted us so many powers that,

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:07.263
never before in the history of spirituality

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:11.123
people had

00:02:11.223 --> 00:02:15.313
this power of awakening of Kundalini.

00:02:17.313 --> 00:02:21.038
As soon as they got their awakening perhaps,

00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:24.153
they went more on to the left or to the right,

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:28.293
and tried to achieve powers

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:36.183
which were not so much for the benevolence of others.

00:02:38.243 --> 00:02:41.133
Buddha has written clearly

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:44.293
that, “When the incarnation of future Buddha,

00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:49.133
that is Maitreya, three Mothers put together, comes in,

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:56.123
that time it will be used for the benevolence of people.”

00:02:56.153 --> 00:02:58.183
This is one of the signs,

00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:01.183
"of the people",

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:06.183
not only of Sahaja Yogis but of the people.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:14.233
So how can it be unless and until those who are Buddhas,

00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:16.303
means those who are Realized souls

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:22.303
know the science of Kundalini?

00:03:24.323 --> 00:03:29.163
Those people who had very little knowledge about Kundalini,

00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:32.213
who must have read in some scriptures

00:03:32.273 --> 00:03:36.103
or somewhere which is being described,

00:03:39.213 --> 00:03:42.083
started misusing it

00:03:42.123 --> 00:03:44.273
and so they became tantrikas.

00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:49.123
But tantra, as you know very well,

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:55.193
is the mechanism of Kundalini,

00:03:55.918 --> 00:04:01.153
and the yantra is the Kundalini itself,

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:05.183
is the machine.

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:11.233
Today I think,

00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:14.123
as we know so much about Kundalini,

00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:17.093
how it passes through different centers,

00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:21.213
how it rises, all those things as we know,

00:04:21.263 --> 00:04:27.103
we should find out how we can nourish our Kundalini.

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:29.273
That's very important to know.

00:04:34.183 --> 00:04:40.213
First of all there's a big difference between

00:04:40.243 --> 00:04:45.243
you people and other people who got their Realization.

00:04:46.323 --> 00:04:50.323
First big difference is this,

00:04:51.163 --> 00:04:58.183
that this power you have achieved Sahaj, easily.

00:04:59.163 --> 00:05:02.273
Others had to go to Himalayas,

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:07.293
stand in the cold air for days together, so many died,

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:10.133
live in the caves,

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:13.133
eating fruits,

00:05:13.243 --> 00:05:15.263
sometimes nothing.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.143
Even Buddha's time they had to use only one piece of cloth

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:25.173
to cover their body

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:31.143
and they had to ask for alms

00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:41.113
in the villages and somehow cook some food and eat it

00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:45.303
- whether it was cold or hot, no comforts.

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.083
On the contrary,

00:05:48.173 --> 00:05:54.283
He taught them that you should give up all our comforts

00:05:56.283 --> 00:05:59.253
because you can live without comforts.

00:06:00.313 --> 00:06:05.283
But none of them got Realization

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:09.193
and none of them could do the work

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:12.123
of awakening of Kundalini.

00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:23.143
So the difference is too much,

00:06:23.223 --> 00:06:26.153
the way you got your Realization,

00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:32.093
the way your Kundalini, in a very Sahaj manner, was awakened

00:06:32.313 --> 00:06:36.253
and the way you are manifesting those powers

00:06:36.283 --> 00:06:38.233
that you have got.

00:06:38.313 --> 00:06:41.283
For example you can give Realization to others,

00:06:42.143 --> 00:06:44.113
you can cure others,

00:06:44.193 --> 00:06:47.123
you can feel the vibrations of others,

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.083
there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:53.163
who can control rain, sun, moon, everything.

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:56.203
Sahaja Yogis, some of them,

00:06:56.253 --> 00:06:59.083
have tremendous powers of prayers.

00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:03.103
Just by praying they have saved the lives of many people.

00:07:06.203 --> 00:07:15.143
And these powers were available to some of them,

00:07:15.223 --> 00:07:22.313
even to the rishis and great munis on those days,

00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:31.083
but their powers were not based on love and compassion.

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:33.213
This is your special field

00:07:33.243 --> 00:07:41.113
because you have to work for the benevolence of the people.

00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:45.193
Their field was to protect themselves

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:49.143
or to destroy.

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:55.103
So they developed powers of curses,

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:57.223
like sharp,

00:07:57.313 --> 00:08:00.113
they could curse people.

00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:03.083
You haven't got that power;

00:08:03.193 --> 00:08:05.303
you cannot curse anyone.

00:08:06.313 --> 00:08:11.103
Very nicely that power I have cancelled.

00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:20.133
Nor do I curse, I can, but I never curse anyone,

00:08:20.243 --> 00:08:29.313
because our basis is love and compassion and tenderliness.

00:08:31.223 --> 00:08:34.213
They were very hot-tempered people, most of them,

00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:36.143
extremely hot temper,

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:42.083
and sometimes they used also terrible harsh languages

00:08:42.113 --> 00:08:45.313
whenever they spoke about the people

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:48.203
who were not realized or who were troubling them.

00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:50.273
This was very funny

00:08:51.173 --> 00:08:54.203
the way they were angry with the society,

00:08:57.083 --> 00:08:59.313
the way they described them.

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:06.163
Some of them did not look at the society,

00:09:06.193 --> 00:09:08.143
did not denounce the society,

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.193
did not say bad things about the society

00:09:12.123 --> 00:09:16.273
but they were only satisfied with themselves

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:22.193
or they wrote about the blessings that they are having.

00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:25.303
But you have a new dimension;

00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:30.283
you have to use your powers

00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:35.263
for the benevolence of the people.

00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:44.163
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

00:09:47.173 --> 00:09:51.303
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:56.173
So this time, we should say,

00:09:56.223 --> 00:09:59.203
your Kundalini can only be nourished

00:09:59.313 --> 00:10:04.143
if you develop within yourself

00:10:06.143 --> 00:10:12.223
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

00:10:14.203 --> 00:10:18.223
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:24.173
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

00:10:24.303 --> 00:10:32.173
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

00:10:32.203 --> 00:10:35.093
maybe with your lust.

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:40.143
Maybe your love might be directed

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:44.173
towards some person, only.

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:47.233
Kundalini is not like that.

00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:51.233
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:53.203
She doesn't get involved into any,

00:10:53.233 --> 00:10:56.283
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

00:10:57.093 --> 00:11:00.223
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:05.093
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

00:11:05.253 --> 00:11:08.183
should not get involved

00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:13.093
into any relationship as such.

00:11:14.093 --> 00:11:16.143
Is possible.

00:11:16.183 --> 00:11:20.143
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.183
For example, as I have always told you,

00:11:23.223 --> 00:11:24.293
the sap in the tree rises

00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:27.293
and goes to various parts of the tree

00:11:27.323 --> 00:11:31.113
and then evaporates or comes back.

00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:36.153
So this passage should be kept open,

00:11:38.233 --> 00:11:41.233
and once this passage is kept open

00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:48.173
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

00:11:50.123 --> 00:11:52.313
But this passage can be closed,

00:11:53.153 --> 00:11:57.123
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

00:11:57.223 --> 00:12:02.183
because there are some people

00:12:06.093 --> 00:12:10.083
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

00:12:10.113 --> 00:12:12.173
All right, in the beginning I know,

00:12:12.223 --> 00:12:14.203
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:18.183
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:23.173
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

00:12:23.283 --> 00:12:27.093
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

00:12:27.223 --> 00:12:29.123
They'll write long, long letters

00:12:29.173 --> 00:12:30.223
describing the relationship

00:12:30.253 --> 00:12:36.093
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

00:12:36.143 --> 00:12:37.233
Without writing the names

00:12:37.263 --> 00:12:40.093
they will give all the connections that they have.

00:12:40.143 --> 00:12:42.283
These are all artificial connections.

00:12:44.153 --> 00:12:47.123
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:51.153
these relationships are of no use;

00:12:51.183 --> 00:12:54.223
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

00:12:55.283 --> 00:12:58.253
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

00:12:58.323 --> 00:13:00.253
in what family you were born,

00:13:00.283 --> 00:13:02.153
in what religion you were born,

00:13:02.183 --> 00:13:04.253
in what country you are born,

00:13:05.283 --> 00:13:08.253
because now you are a universal being.

00:13:09.253 --> 00:13:13.293
So you are no more related

00:13:14.263 --> 00:13:17.153
through these artificial relationships

00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:22.283
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

00:13:24.173 --> 00:13:29.083
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

00:13:29.263 --> 00:13:31.263
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.283
give up your wife, give up your children,

00:13:33.303 --> 00:13:35.313
nothing of the kind;

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:41.083
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

00:13:41.223 --> 00:13:44.253
we have to give up all these things.

00:13:47.263 --> 00:13:50.153
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

00:13:51.313 --> 00:13:54.233
If there are some good conditionings,

00:13:56.143 --> 00:13:57.233
still we should give up

00:13:57.263 --> 00:14:00.233
in the sense they should not be conditionings

00:14:00.293 --> 00:14:02.313
but we should be master of them.

00:14:03.113 --> 00:14:06.143
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:07.233
in their own country,

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:10.203
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

00:14:11.223 --> 00:14:13.203
I used to do the same.

00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:16.203
Then England is horrible for that.

00:14:17.153 --> 00:14:20.203
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

00:14:20.283 --> 00:14:22.253
it's a cursed country,

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:24.283
you just can't do that.

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:26.223
You have to take your bath in the night

00:14:26.253 --> 00:14:28.283
otherwise give up bathing;

00:14:30.113 --> 00:14:31.203
and one has to change.

00:14:31.213 --> 00:14:33.133
But if you have that conditioning,

00:14:33.193 --> 00:14:35.193
then you will feel very sad,

00:14:35.223 --> 00:14:37.243
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:42.153
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:46.193
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

00:14:47.213 --> 00:14:49.273
So whether it is good or bad,

00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:51.273
if it is a conditioning

00:14:52.193 --> 00:14:56.213
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

00:14:59.193 --> 00:15:01.083
That doesn't mean that you should go

00:15:01.113 --> 00:15:02.153
in the opposite direction,

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:04.093
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

00:15:04.123 --> 00:15:06.083
that's not the way.

00:15:09.203 --> 00:15:11.093
It is that,

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:14.093
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:15.193
I'll have it in the evening,

00:15:15.233 --> 00:15:17.253
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:21.203
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

00:15:23.143 --> 00:15:24.617
Nothing should control you,

00:15:24.642 --> 00:15:27.193
then the Kundalini moves for us,

00:15:27.253 --> 00:15:30.203
because you must have complete liberty.

00:15:31.153 --> 00:15:33.233
If you do not have complete liberty

00:15:33.313 --> 00:15:36.093
then the Kundalini won't move.

00:15:41.056 --> 00:15:43.480
We have conditionings of our families,

00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:47.093
of our religion,

00:15:47.786 --> 00:15:49.816
of our country.

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:54.936
These conditionings, as far as possible,

00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:59.906
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

00:16:02.786 --> 00:16:03.856
family.

00:16:03.906 --> 00:16:05.956
If you are born a Christian

00:16:06.846 --> 00:16:09.796
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:11.906
Christ you have not seen,

00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:13.936
you don't know whether He existed or not,

00:16:13.996 --> 00:16:15.926
whether this Bible is true or not

00:16:15.966 --> 00:16:17.966
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

00:16:18.826 --> 00:16:20.549
Now if you are a Hindu,

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:24.826
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

00:16:25.006 --> 00:16:28.796
This creates imbalance,

00:16:29.896 --> 00:16:33.786
because we must have the same attitude

00:16:33.846 --> 00:16:36.966
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.926
that's the sign of a saint.

00:16:43.856 --> 00:16:46.856
So this conditioning has to go.

00:16:47.816 --> 00:16:51.926
In what country you are born is another conditioning

00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:53.936
which has to be fought out;

00:16:54.786 --> 00:16:56.816
very important it is.

00:16:57.986 --> 00:17:00.786
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

00:17:00.826 --> 00:17:03.826
of different countries but you know very well.

00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:06.816
After Realization when you rise higher

00:17:06.856 --> 00:17:08.986
than your society which is surrounding you,

00:17:09.826 --> 00:17:13.856
you start understanding and you start describing.

00:17:13.936 --> 00:17:16.700
I've come to know about the stupidity

00:17:16.906 --> 00:17:18.936
of all these countries through the people

00:17:18.966 --> 00:17:20.936
who belong to that country.

00:17:20.986 --> 00:17:22.936
For example a Frenchman will say,

00:17:22.966 --> 00:17:26.926
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

00:17:27.698 --> 00:17:29.826
he's a French otherwise born.”

00:17:29.936 --> 00:17:31.786
Or a Hindu will say,

00:17:31.846 --> 00:17:34.786
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

00:17:34.816 --> 00:17:35.986
he will do like this.”

00:17:36.896 --> 00:17:39.956
So then you understand that you are not typifying

00:17:40.006 --> 00:17:41.856
that country,

00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.816
you are a universal being

00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:46.786
and you are living like a universal being.

00:17:49.876 --> 00:17:51.996
Once you become the universal being

00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:56.986
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

00:17:57.016 --> 00:17:59.786
makes no difference in the world.

00:18:00.986 --> 00:18:04.846
So then you don't start hating somebody

00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:08.876
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

00:18:08.906 --> 00:18:10.816
both ways it works.

00:18:10.896 --> 00:18:16.678
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

00:18:16.703 --> 00:18:18.956
but “darkers” also hate equally.

00:18:19.926 --> 00:18:23.556
And mutually they believe that they are all

00:18:23.856 --> 00:18:25.896
absolutely wrong.

00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:29.906
If you ask a fanatic

00:18:31.846 --> 00:18:34.786
about another religion he'll say,

00:18:34.826 --> 00:18:36.966
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

00:18:37.796 --> 00:18:40.816
And you ask the another fanatic,

00:18:40.896 --> 00:18:45.846
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

00:18:45.876 --> 00:18:47.956
That means all of them are the worst,

00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:49.896
in a general opinion.

00:18:49.906 --> 00:18:51.796
Everybody seems to be the worst,

00:18:51.826 --> 00:18:52.966
all the fanatics are the worst,

00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:55.986
if you take a general consensus, you see.

00:18:56.956 --> 00:18:58.791
Nobody will say that,

00:18:58.816 --> 00:18:59.936
"All right, my religion is all right

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:03.006
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:07.826
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:11.856
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

00:19:12.896 --> 00:19:15.906
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:17.856
with the other English for misbehaving

00:19:17.896 --> 00:19:20.896
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.966
because they are blind.

00:19:23.801 --> 00:19:26.911
So here the compassion should come within you,

00:19:26.936 --> 00:19:28.590
as a universal being,

00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:31.966
that by God's grace you have risen higher

00:19:31.986 --> 00:19:33.896
in the real sense of the word.

00:19:33.926 --> 00:19:35.856
It is not just you are certified,

00:19:35.906 --> 00:19:37.816
you are realized souls, no.

00:19:37.906 --> 00:19:43.986
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:48.961
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

00:19:48.986 --> 00:19:51.016
that you are realized souls.

00:19:52.006 --> 00:19:54.956
Naturally you must change everything.

00:19:57.856 --> 00:20:01.856
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:09.956
with something that is now, you have given up.

00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:12.966
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:17.876
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:20.896
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

00:20:20.956 --> 00:20:23.816
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

00:20:23.966 --> 00:20:27.786
In the same way we should accept our position.

00:20:27.956 --> 00:20:32.856
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

00:20:32.896 --> 00:20:35.936
with self-esteem and understanding

00:20:35.986 --> 00:20:38.876
as to what is our purpose of life now;

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.966
it is changed completely, entirely.

00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:44.856
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

00:20:44.906 --> 00:20:47.876
innately, not outside because I am saying,

00:20:47.926 --> 00:20:49.786
or is a mental process,

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:52.816
but inside you feel responsible.

00:20:52.856 --> 00:20:56.926
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

00:20:56.966 --> 00:20:59.906
and to emancipate the whole world.

00:21:00.856 --> 00:21:02.986
Once you realize this point

00:21:03.896 --> 00:21:06.846
then automatically you take up responsibilities

00:21:06.896 --> 00:21:08.906
and the Kundalini will rise.

00:21:10.786 --> 00:21:12.846
I know of many people who said,

00:21:12.876 --> 00:21:15.796
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

00:21:15.846 --> 00:21:17.956
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:22.966
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

00:21:25.956 --> 00:21:27.906
There are many who said that,

00:21:27.936 --> 00:21:30.846
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

00:21:30.876 --> 00:21:32.016
we cannot sing.”

00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:35.816
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

00:21:35.956 --> 00:21:37.876
that people had to tell her that you…

00:21:37.946 --> 00:21:39.876
because she would always go out of tune

00:21:39.906 --> 00:21:41.866
and very loudly she would sing;

00:21:42.006 --> 00:21:43.761
then they had to tell her,

00:21:43.786 --> 00:21:44.846
“Now you better keep at the back

00:21:44.896 --> 00:21:46.846
and don't sing now any more.”

00:21:46.956 --> 00:21:51.006
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

00:21:52.786 --> 00:21:55.816
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

00:21:55.866 --> 00:21:58.836
which you should accept that they have come to you,

00:21:59.866 --> 00:22:04.806
and give up all that you call as fear.

00:22:06.956 --> 00:22:09.876
All kinds of fear we have.

00:22:10.786 --> 00:22:14.816
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

00:22:14.846 --> 00:22:16.836
left-sided man what he should do.

00:22:17.946 --> 00:22:22.786
But what a left-sided man has to know

00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:25.986
that he is now an enlightened soul

00:22:26.956 --> 00:22:31.926
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

00:22:32.876 --> 00:22:35.926
No saint will be destroyed.

00:22:35.996 --> 00:22:39.026
Those who will try to destroy you

00:22:39.826 --> 00:22:43.846
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:47.026
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

00:22:47.096 --> 00:22:50.846
very jocular manner.

00:22:50.916 --> 00:22:52.876
You'll laugh at

00:22:52.966 --> 00:22:56.026
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:58.846
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

00:22:58.906 --> 00:23:00.906
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

00:23:00.956 --> 00:23:03.886
means their destruction will start

00:23:03.936 --> 00:23:06.956
by their own stupid methods.

00:23:07.816 --> 00:23:09.796
They'll become stupid.

00:23:09.916 --> 00:23:12.956
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

00:23:13.906 --> 00:23:16.906
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:18.906
You don't have to worry about that part.

00:23:18.986 --> 00:23:21.806
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

00:23:21.956 --> 00:23:27.796
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:30.537
So that part you have to give up.

00:23:30.704 --> 00:23:33.846
You just forgive that person.

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:37.026
As soon as you forgive,

00:23:38.996 --> 00:23:41.916
the responsibility from you shifts

00:23:43.796 --> 00:23:45.906
and then Kundalini rises.

00:23:46.886 --> 00:23:50.886
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

00:23:50.936 --> 00:23:54.826
but just laugh because they are blind,

00:23:54.996 --> 00:23:57.026
because they are stupid,

00:23:57.826 --> 00:23:58.966
they are foolish.

00:24:00.816 --> 00:24:03.846
What do we do if you see an idiot?

00:24:04.796 --> 00:24:06.916
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

00:24:06.956 --> 00:24:10.916
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

00:24:11.956 --> 00:24:14.956
So they become idiotic

00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:19.816
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

00:24:19.856 --> 00:24:21.617
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:21.642 --> 00:24:23.906
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

00:24:24.936 --> 00:24:27.846
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

00:24:27.886 --> 00:24:29.806
behaving in that manner

00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:34.936
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

00:24:35.966 --> 00:24:39.936
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

00:24:40.966 --> 00:24:43.846
same about organizations or anything.

00:24:43.886 --> 00:24:45.986
Naturally you have to know one thing:

00:24:46.846 --> 00:24:48.846
that as you are Realized souls,

00:24:49.026 --> 00:24:50.886
you have seen the truth,

00:24:50.936 --> 00:24:52.966
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

00:24:52.996 --> 00:24:54.936
they are going to oppose you.

00:24:56.946 --> 00:24:59.976
They did this, isn't it, to others;

00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:03.936
everybody suffered so much.

00:25:05.966 --> 00:25:08.886
But now no more sufferings to you,

00:25:08.996 --> 00:25:12.946
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.936
Just understand this point,

00:25:17.006 --> 00:25:20.926
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

00:25:21.006 --> 00:25:25.866
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

00:25:26.786 --> 00:25:29.415
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

00:25:29.816 --> 00:25:32.826
all this fear and left side will go away.

00:25:34.016 --> 00:25:37.956
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

00:25:38.006 --> 00:25:40.906
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

00:25:40.966 --> 00:25:42.936
You are so powerful.

00:25:43.006 --> 00:25:44.926
Just with one glance

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:47.786
you can see them dancing on their heads,

00:25:47.926 --> 00:25:49.866
the other way round.

00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:53.896
As long as you'll have fear

00:25:53.936 --> 00:25:58.816
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:00.846
who are cowards.

00:26:01.796 --> 00:26:03.986
Cowardice She is not going to support.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.956
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

00:26:08.896 --> 00:26:10.926
You are walking on the street,

00:26:11.016 --> 00:26:14.906
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

00:26:14.966 --> 00:26:18.816
afraid that somebody might attack,

00:26:18.926 --> 00:26:20.876
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

00:26:20.926 --> 00:26:21.936
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

00:26:21.986 --> 00:26:24.846
because he knows there are ganas

00:26:24.896 --> 00:26:26.816
and there are angels around him.

00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:28.796
No one can touch him,

00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:30.896
and the one who will try,

00:26:31.796 --> 00:26:34.791
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

00:26:34.816 --> 00:26:36.906
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

00:26:38.896 --> 00:26:40.866
Now you watch and see.

00:26:42.016 --> 00:26:46.986
So this left side or this fear should go.

00:26:47.016 --> 00:26:50.786
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

00:26:50.846 --> 00:26:56.986
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

00:26:59.006 --> 00:27:03.796
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.

00:27:08.826 --> 00:27:15.906
Then another problem is for the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:27:15.956 --> 00:27:17.926
is your ego.

00:27:17.976 --> 00:27:20.826
That's tremendous, I must admit,

00:27:21.786 --> 00:27:24.826
rather too much for people who follow Christ,

00:27:24.866 --> 00:27:28.786
is very surprising and those who follow Buddha,

00:27:29.956 --> 00:27:32.016
because they are anti-Christ,

00:27:32.846 --> 00:27:34.986
because they are anti-Buddha.

00:27:35.896 --> 00:27:38.906
The one who on the cross said that,

00:27:38.956 --> 00:27:39.906
“Oh Father,

00:27:39.956 --> 00:27:43.786
forgive them for they do not know what they are doing”;

00:27:43.876 --> 00:27:47.613
if you are following Him how can you have ego?

00:27:52.016 --> 00:28:00.826
Now the forgiveness should be absolutely spontaneous within.

00:28:05.846 --> 00:28:10.976
There should be no ripple even of anger

00:28:11.786 --> 00:28:13.936
because you are so powerful.

00:28:16.976 --> 00:28:20.876
What can anybody harm you?

00:28:20.986 --> 00:28:22.956
But if you catch on your Agnya,

00:28:22.986 --> 00:28:24.846
only you are harming yourself.

00:28:24.876 --> 00:28:27.876
If you want to harm yourself nobody can help it.

00:28:30.826 --> 00:28:33.976
So this anger, which comes from liver

00:28:34.016 --> 00:28:40.866
and settles down in your Agnya, has to be looked into.

00:28:41.876 --> 00:28:44.976
That's a very important thing where Kundalini stops,

00:28:45.006 --> 00:28:47.016
in the West specially.

00:28:50.026 --> 00:28:56.916
Because this whole culture here has created two problems.

00:28:58.006 --> 00:29:03.806
The first one is acquisition instinct,

00:29:05.786 --> 00:29:08.916
what you call as greed.

00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:13.916
The more greed you have the more these machines can run

00:29:13.956 --> 00:29:18.926
and you can have industrial development of plastics,

00:29:19.816 --> 00:29:23.846
and then have a conference against ecology.

00:29:26.886 --> 00:29:28.886
In Spain I saw,

00:29:29.806 --> 00:29:31.986
I don't know, there must be three, four car factories

00:29:32.026 --> 00:29:34.866
because every car had only one driver

00:29:34.916 --> 00:29:36.956
because it had to be there.

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:40.896
And so many cars

00:29:41.866 --> 00:29:44.846
that you just don't know how to move.

00:29:44.886 --> 00:29:47.916
For your program also is impossible,

00:29:47.956 --> 00:29:49.916
you must start two hours earlier

00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:51.986
when you can just take fifteen minutes.

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:56.806
In France is another thing, Paris.

00:29:57.006 --> 00:29:59.836
Paris, if you want to go somewhere

00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:02.916
you should start at four o'clock in the morning,

00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:06.846
otherwise you cannot reach that place.

00:30:08.836 --> 00:30:12.976
Same about Milan and same about Rome.

00:30:13.886 --> 00:30:15.926
The worst is Switzerland,

00:30:16.806 --> 00:30:19.861
I don't know what to say about Switzerland,

00:30:19.886 --> 00:30:23.826
the name itself is rather, very dangerous,

00:30:29.026 --> 00:30:32.976
because they are making all ugly money,

00:30:33.026 --> 00:30:34.856
they are doing all these things,

00:30:34.886 --> 00:30:36.946
I mean every kind of sin they have got

00:30:36.996 --> 00:30:39.936
in the name of acquisition.

00:30:40.016 --> 00:30:43.801
For them nothing like sin, taking somebody's money nicely,

00:30:43.826 --> 00:30:46.856
keeping that there, extracting money from poor countries,

00:30:46.916 --> 00:30:48.996
keeping, they don't feel there's anything wrong,

00:30:49.026 --> 00:30:51.796
I mean, they have become immune.

00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:57.936
So this acquisition instinct that we have

00:30:58.016 --> 00:30:59.986
and which has been very much fanned

00:31:00.026 --> 00:31:06.026
and has been made into a big sort of a quality in the West,

00:31:08.856 --> 00:31:12.936
we should try to see it clearly.

00:31:13.936 --> 00:31:17.876
In the olden days in the same European countries

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:21.906
this was used for creating art,

00:31:23.016 --> 00:31:26.916
for producing artist, for supporting artist.

00:31:27.936 --> 00:31:29.826
Even in our country,

00:31:29.856 --> 00:31:31.986
artists were supported by the kings

00:31:32.026 --> 00:31:35.876
and all the big empires that we had.

00:31:37.966 --> 00:31:40.806
These days there's no question,

00:31:40.846 --> 00:31:43.856
no government is willing to support the artist.

00:31:44.876 --> 00:31:47.936
You know that Mozart was called by the queen herself

00:31:48.026 --> 00:31:50.026
to play before her.

00:31:51.886 --> 00:31:55.806
So the governments were not only looking after

00:31:55.836 --> 00:31:57.796
the collection of taxes

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.771
but they were looking after the artists,

00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:06.916
musicians, painters and people who did creative art.

00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:11.026
Like in France you can see

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:15.906
how their queen collected beautiful artistic things

00:32:15.946 --> 00:32:18.026
and encouraged artists

00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:22.876
to do artistic work,

00:32:22.916 --> 00:32:24.966
spent her money in that,

00:32:25.936 --> 00:32:29.986
and now, you know that she was killed by people.

00:32:30.886 --> 00:32:34.886
By killing her they have killed the art of France.

00:32:39.966 --> 00:32:43.876
And now the French themselves have become bourgeois,

00:32:43.916 --> 00:32:46.916
those whom they condemned, they have become that.

00:32:48.796 --> 00:32:50.906
So acquisition instinct

00:32:50.966 --> 00:32:59.806
has to be taken to the acquisition of art.

00:33:02.806 --> 00:33:07.796
That also should not be plastic

00:33:07.846 --> 00:33:10.946
otherwise tomorrow we might start buying plastic

00:33:10.986 --> 00:33:13.026
artistic things.

00:33:13.936 --> 00:33:17.966
Genuinely made, hand made things.

00:33:21.796 --> 00:33:25.766
Or the music also which is very deep,

00:33:25.826 --> 00:33:30.916
classical, singing the songs of the Divine;

00:33:30.966 --> 00:33:34.856
not the cheap type music which just makes you mad

00:33:34.886 --> 00:33:40.946
or makes you full of lust and greed.

00:33:42.796 --> 00:33:45.826
So this is one of the problems of your culture

00:33:45.886 --> 00:33:51.016
which gives you this kind of a ego.

00:33:53.846 --> 00:34:00.846
I mean, people if they have say, a Rolls Royce

00:34:01.846 --> 00:34:03.946
then of course nobody can talk to them,

00:34:03.986 --> 00:34:08.856
their brain has blown out of their hats, completely.

00:34:08.906 --> 00:34:11.996
But even the driver of the Rolls Royce

00:34:12.986 --> 00:34:15.846
who doesn't own the Rolls Royce, he drives it,

00:34:15.886 --> 00:34:17.956
his head is off.

00:34:18.916 --> 00:34:21.936
He has a different gait, he walks in a different way,

00:34:21.986 --> 00:34:24.826
he talks in a different way.

00:34:29.826 --> 00:34:34.936
So this acquisition instinct gives you so much of ego.

00:34:35.886 --> 00:34:37.966
I mean, you go to somebody's house,

00:34:38.856 --> 00:34:41.966
like some stupid Indians who are now in England

00:34:43.796 --> 00:34:45.796
I went to their house;

00:34:45.846 --> 00:34:50.801
they're sadarjis - means following the path of Guru Nanaka

00:34:50.826 --> 00:34:52.986
where drinking is not allowed.

00:34:53.856 --> 00:34:58.016
So as soon as you rise he shows us a pub in his house.

00:34:58.916 --> 00:35:04.512
“My God,” I said. I went back three, four steps, you see.

00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:08.846
He says, “See my pubu,” as he says,

00:35:09.016 --> 00:35:13.876
and from the pub he takes out a soda thing and shows us how

00:35:13.936 --> 00:35:16.886
it pumps out the soda, just imagine

00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:21.966
and he wouldn't talk, you know.

00:35:22.806 --> 00:35:24.906
And when we said, "We don't drink,"

00:35:24.966 --> 00:35:28.026
he thought we were sinners of the worst type,

00:35:29.826 --> 00:35:31.856
that we don't drink.

00:35:32.906 --> 00:35:36.826
So this acquisition instinct is now ending up

00:35:36.986 --> 00:35:43.806
into something which is very cheap, vulgar and immoral.

00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:51.956
The fondness for showing off

00:35:52.816 --> 00:35:57.006
is so much that you are sometimes shocked,

00:35:57.926 --> 00:36:00.906
the way people try to show off.

00:36:01.836 --> 00:36:04.876
Like a American lady came from America

00:36:05.786 --> 00:36:07.846
and she asked Me, “Mrs. Srivastava,

00:36:07.876 --> 00:36:10.816
how many pubs You have seen in London?”

00:36:11.806 --> 00:36:12.876
I said, “None.”

00:36:12.906 --> 00:36:19.976
“Oh, You are good for nothing, useless, absolutely.

00:36:20.816 --> 00:36:24.976
You haven't seen any pub. The best houses in any village,

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:27.926
any city in England is a pub.”

00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:30.826
I said, “From outside I have seen.”

00:36:30.886 --> 00:36:32.806
All right, just to satisfy;

00:36:32.856 --> 00:36:34.856
I thought she’s artistic.

00:36:35.906 --> 00:36:40.976
“No, no, no, no. Do You know the best pub in London?”

00:36:41.806 --> 00:36:43.946
She gave Me the list, you know.

00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.986
I said, “Which one is the best?”

00:36:48.026 --> 00:36:50.906
“There was one called Hermit's Pub.”

00:36:51.886 --> 00:36:53.976
I said: "What is this supposed to be?"

00:36:54.856 --> 00:36:59.826
"You know, the man who was living in this house died

00:36:59.946 --> 00:37:02.856
and nobody knew that he's dead,

00:37:03.886 --> 00:37:08.856
so for months together nobody went in

00:37:08.916 --> 00:37:11.886
and the whole place was filled with that stink,

00:37:12.836 --> 00:37:15.826
and lots of cobwebs were there.

00:37:16.026 --> 00:37:18.986
Then they removed that

00:37:21.886 --> 00:37:23.916
dead body from there,

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:27.798
and the stink is still there and the cobwebs,

00:37:27.826 --> 00:37:29.876
absolutely intact, you know.

00:37:30.856 --> 00:37:33.856
You have to be careful that you don't break them.

00:37:34.856 --> 00:37:39.826
And there, that is the best pub,

00:37:39.876 --> 00:37:42.876
for which you have to pay quite a lot.

00:37:43.026 --> 00:37:44.916
And I have seen that.”

00:37:44.946 --> 00:37:49.946
So proud. So where does it end then?

00:37:50.856 --> 00:37:54.986
This acquisition instinct ends in where?

00:37:56.796 --> 00:37:59.996
In rottening things, in putrefying,

00:38:01.826 --> 00:38:03.906
you may call it fermenting.

00:38:07.026 --> 00:38:09.836
It has to end up

00:38:09.906 --> 00:38:11.946
because the reaction of the ego comes

00:38:11.996 --> 00:38:16.916
and you start enjoying things which are rotten.

00:38:16.966 --> 00:38:19.026
Like cheese of France,

00:38:20.886 --> 00:38:25.876
never eat that, I tell you, you'll burn your finger,

00:38:25.966 --> 00:38:29.936
you will burn your throat and you'll burn your stomach.

00:38:30.966 --> 00:38:33.806
It is very rotten,

00:38:33.966 --> 00:38:36.936
and the more rotten it is the better.

00:38:38.806 --> 00:38:42.886
The wine, the wine is the rotten grape juice,

00:38:42.936 --> 00:38:44.826
absolutely rotten,

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:45.966
you can't take it,

00:38:46.016 --> 00:38:50.986
it smells, I've seen smells like a rotten cork.

00:38:53.796 --> 00:38:55.916
I asked somebody, “How does it smell?”

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.986
He said, “It's very fine.”

00:38:58.796 --> 00:39:02.836
I said, “Does it smell like rotten cork?”

00:39:02.876 --> 00:39:04.836
“I've never smelt a cork.”

00:39:04.946 --> 00:39:07.996
That's why I said - if he had smelt a rotten cork

00:39:08.796 --> 00:39:10.966
he would never have taken to wine;

00:39:11.856 --> 00:39:15.016
so all things that are rotten.

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.986
You know the discovery of cheese, what had happened,

00:39:17.996 --> 00:39:19.976
how it started, do you know that?

00:39:20.936 --> 00:39:26.796
There was a big snowfall and milk was left in one cave.

00:39:26.946 --> 00:39:30.966
So because of the snowfall everybody forgot about the milk,

00:39:31.796 --> 00:39:36.996
it was left there, then summer time the milk became rotten,

00:39:37.021 --> 00:39:39.936
then it became more rotten, more rotten.

00:39:40.026 --> 00:39:44.806
After twelve years or so, somebody went and saw this there.

00:39:53.876 --> 00:39:56.946
Thank God I have not taken My food today.

00:40:01.796 --> 00:40:05.906
And so they took that milk,

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:08.826
they called it cheese.

00:40:12.806 --> 00:40:16.906
In India cheez is used in Urdu language specially,

00:40:16.946 --> 00:40:18.986
for something which is,

00:40:19.826 --> 00:40:22.906
something special thing, something very special,

00:40:22.996 --> 00:40:25.906
and also as you know in music they use it

00:40:25.946 --> 00:40:31.026
for some special composition, cheez.

00:40:32.936 --> 00:40:39.856
But here the cheese is the most rotten milk

00:40:40.806 --> 00:40:44.026
which no human beings or animals should eat.

00:40:44.886 --> 00:40:48.856
Worms may, so they gave it to worms,

00:40:48.936 --> 00:40:56.806
and I know in Holland and also in Sweden I think, yah,

00:40:59.016 --> 00:41:02.016
they had cheese with worms

00:41:02.826 --> 00:41:04.916
and they were eating the worms;

00:41:04.986 --> 00:41:08.826
can you beat it, it is true;

00:41:09.836 --> 00:41:12.026
not only the cheese but also the worms.

00:41:14.026 --> 00:41:16.806
I mean see where we have ended up

00:41:16.856 --> 00:41:19.026
into our acquisition instinct.

00:41:21.806 --> 00:41:25.781
The wine has to be hundred year old, certified,

00:41:25.806 --> 00:41:26.946
that's the best.

00:41:29.916 --> 00:41:33.806
Such rotten things we are eating,

00:41:33.846 --> 00:41:36.806
they smell, I tell you, they smell of it.

00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:39.906
That's why, once I was surprised that,

00:41:40.026 --> 00:41:42.946
they go to the bathroom, don't even wash their hands.

00:41:43.026 --> 00:41:45.856
We get such horrible smells, they don't get

00:41:45.886 --> 00:41:47.836
because if you take that cheese

00:41:47.886 --> 00:41:49.996
you cannot smell anything rotten.

00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:52.906
Even if you put them in the gutters

00:41:52.946 --> 00:41:54.771
they won't feel anything rotten

00:41:54.796 --> 00:41:58.806
because it's all that dirty smell, they are used to.

00:41:59.906 --> 00:42:01.906
Is the filth, I mean even if they go to hell

00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:04.836
they won't feel bad because the smell will be the same.

00:42:10.856 --> 00:42:12.996
So where should we put them?

00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:18.826
They are so immune to that dirty smell

00:42:19.906 --> 00:42:23.016
which is absolutely sub-human.

00:42:24.856 --> 00:42:28.906
So this acquisition instinct in any elite society

00:42:28.986 --> 00:42:31.966
- once upon a time French society was regarded as elite

00:42:56.856 --> 00:43:00.651
- so the most elite society was the French society

00:43:00.676 --> 00:43:06.796
was most diplomatic in every way.

00:43:06.926 --> 00:43:10.986
Their food was made with wine, everything was wine,

00:43:12.016 --> 00:43:16.926
and this diplomatic society once upon… ruled the whole

00:43:16.966 --> 00:43:19.006
diplomatic areas.

00:43:21.786 --> 00:43:24.816
But they never realized

00:43:24.986 --> 00:43:31.786
that the whole culture was nothing but eating and drinking.

00:43:32.926 --> 00:43:36.866
Nothing else but eating and drinking.

00:43:39.006 --> 00:43:42.896
And later on maybe little politics started.

00:43:43.936 --> 00:43:47.006
But this eating and drinking

00:43:47.936 --> 00:43:50.796
went to such a limit

00:43:51.826 --> 00:43:55.487
that now they have gone out of diplomatic areas;

00:43:55.512 --> 00:43:59.956
no one wants them because they never think in the right way.

00:44:00.006 --> 00:44:02.876
Any diplomat, French diplomat is anywhere,

00:44:02.936 --> 00:44:05.816
people say, “Is he French?” “Yes.”

00:44:05.896 --> 00:44:07.866
“Then better not call him for this meeting,

00:44:07.906 --> 00:44:12.926
you know, he'll put his own ideas.” They went out.

00:44:13.816 --> 00:44:18.006
So now that eliteness is shifted in America.

00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:21.846
So the most elite are taking to drugs.

00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:23.796
What is it after all?

00:44:23.826 --> 00:44:27.906
Drugs is creation of this acquisition instinct only.

00:44:30.796 --> 00:44:33.966
Why should you blame Colombians or anybody else?

00:44:33.976 --> 00:44:35.786
They are making their money, all right

00:44:35.816 --> 00:44:36.986
as you are all making,

00:44:37.846 --> 00:44:39.956
but the one they are feeding is America,

00:44:40.006 --> 00:44:44.896
and America is the main thing now in acquisition instinct.

00:44:44.976 --> 00:44:46.986
And what are they acquiring?

00:44:47.846 --> 00:44:49.896
I have been in that society,

00:44:49.936 --> 00:44:52.786
they only talk of drugs.

00:44:52.796 --> 00:44:53.986
All right,

00:44:54.816 --> 00:44:56.906
drugs they talk not only that

00:44:56.926 --> 00:44:59.816
but it's like a shopping of drugs.

00:45:00.786 --> 00:45:02.846
They all know where you get drugs,

00:45:02.876 --> 00:45:05.866
all these so-called ambassadors and these people,

00:45:05.906 --> 00:45:07.866
and their wives.

00:45:07.936 --> 00:45:10.946
With all their dresses have become simpler now,

00:45:10.956 --> 00:45:13.906
they do not dress up the way formerly

00:45:13.936 --> 00:45:16.016
the ambassadors’ wives used to dress up.

00:45:16.836 --> 00:45:20.976
I will not be surprised if they come in holey pants.

00:45:24.786 --> 00:45:27.786
So this acquisition instinct you can see in the

00:45:27.836 --> 00:45:30.836
elite society has ended up into drugs,

00:45:30.986 --> 00:45:35.846
and if not, into gurus - false gurus.

00:45:35.906 --> 00:45:38.896
Those who got fed up with this went to false gurus

00:45:38.926 --> 00:45:40.896
because they have no discrimination

00:45:40.936 --> 00:45:43.876
to know what is right and what is wrong.

00:45:45.906 --> 00:45:50.866
See, step by step, how it has gone into the rotten state,

00:45:50.906 --> 00:45:53.926
this ego, in the West.

00:45:53.986 --> 00:45:56.796
So this is the first point,

00:45:56.976 --> 00:46:01.806
is the acquisition instinct you have.

00:46:01.896 --> 00:46:04.956
In that then somebody’s wife is good-looking,

00:46:05.006 --> 00:46:08.946
then every man has a right to look at her.

00:46:09.816 --> 00:46:12.946
Or some man is good-looking, maybe anybody’s husband

00:46:12.976 --> 00:46:15.344
– every woman has right to look at him.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:17.866
Not look at her own husband but another man,

00:46:17.896 --> 00:46:19.786
what’s the use?

00:46:19.816 --> 00:46:20.946
I’ve never been able to understand,

00:46:20.986 --> 00:46:22.946
“What’s the use of looking at another man

00:46:22.986 --> 00:46:25.796
who is not your husband?”

00:46:28.816 --> 00:46:32.417
This acquisition instinct has gone

00:46:32.796 --> 00:46:37.866
into complete immoral life, immoral society

00:46:37.946 --> 00:46:45.976
and they have lost sense of respect of their age.

00:46:47.816 --> 00:46:51.976
A ninety-year-old woman having a love affair

00:46:51.986 --> 00:46:54.946
with a grandson who is eighteen-year-old;

00:46:55.016 --> 00:47:00.786
just think of that, such stupidity, such nonsense.

00:47:00.956 --> 00:47:04.926
How is it possible unless and until

00:47:04.976 --> 00:47:10.836
we have some sort of a perverted acquisition instinct?

00:47:11.006 --> 00:47:13.926
Even art has gone into perversion,

00:47:14.016 --> 00:47:16.986
everything has gone into perversion

00:47:21.946 --> 00:47:25.956
- because the curse of the Western society is that

00:47:25.986 --> 00:47:28.956
there is no maryada.

00:47:29.976 --> 00:47:33.926
And Kundalini rises in its own maryada,

00:47:34.926 --> 00:47:37.866
it brings back your maryadas,

00:47:37.906 --> 00:47:39.976
it keeps you into your maryadas.

00:47:40.006 --> 00:47:41.926
You are a human being,

00:47:41.976 --> 00:47:44.926
don't live like animals, even worse than animals.

00:47:44.976 --> 00:47:49.786
You have no right to do that.

00:47:49.836 --> 00:47:53.480
God has not created you to be sub-human

00:47:53.528 --> 00:47:55.956
but to be super-human being.

00:47:56.016 --> 00:47:59.956
So, this is how it works out.

00:48:01.976 --> 00:48:04.876
You can now think about it, how far it goes

00:48:04.906 --> 00:48:06.956
this acquisition instinct,

00:48:08.866 --> 00:48:10.876
about things.

00:48:12.896 --> 00:48:15.976
But the second very bad curse

00:48:16.906 --> 00:48:21.786
of the Western acquisition instinct is

00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:26.816
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

00:48:30.786 --> 00:48:33.906
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

00:48:35.836 --> 00:48:38.946
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

00:48:38.986 --> 00:48:42.836
I mean they aggressed our country for three hundred years.

00:48:42.866 --> 00:48:45.986
Why? Why did they aggress? We are not bad people.

00:48:46.796 --> 00:48:50.876
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

00:48:51.866 --> 00:48:54.816
we had pearls,

00:48:54.956 --> 00:48:56.896
we had lots of things

00:48:56.926 --> 00:49:00.866
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

00:49:00.906 --> 00:49:03.976
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

00:49:04.866 --> 00:49:06.896
So the French aggressed, these aggressed,

00:49:06.926 --> 00:49:07.976
all the time aggressing.

00:49:08.016 --> 00:49:10.986
Japanese are also following you.

00:49:13.876 --> 00:49:16.896
This aggression then moves the whole society

00:49:16.946 --> 00:49:20.796
into a very destructive force.

00:49:20.946 --> 00:49:24.786
You can see every day the wars are going on,

00:49:24.816 --> 00:49:26.796
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

00:49:26.846 --> 00:49:28.896
they want this, they want that.

00:49:28.956 --> 00:49:31.906
And this aggression has also penetrated

00:49:31.946 --> 00:49:34.846
the developing countries, the third world also.

00:49:34.876 --> 00:49:38.946
So, nicely the disease is on.

00:49:42.926 --> 00:49:48.836
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

00:49:49.836 --> 00:49:52.846
How? By giving you joy.

00:49:54.836 --> 00:49:56.946
You enjoy everything.

00:49:57.876 --> 00:50:00.816
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

00:50:00.926 --> 00:50:03.926
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

00:50:03.976 --> 00:50:07.906
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

00:50:07.946 --> 00:50:09.781
because that gives you joy

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:12.896
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

00:50:13.006 --> 00:50:15.986
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:22.016
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:26.926
and in that joy you don't want anything,

00:50:28.836 --> 00:50:29.926
you don't ask for anything;

00:50:29.976 --> 00:50:31.876
you just enjoy yourself;

00:50:31.906 --> 00:50:34.896
you are the property of enjoyment.

00:50:35.976 --> 00:50:39.016
Sanskrit they say,  “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

00:50:39.866 --> 00:50:43.926
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

00:50:47.866 --> 00:50:51.896
So into small things you must see joy,

00:50:52.876 --> 00:50:57.876
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

00:50:58.796 --> 00:51:00.806
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,

00:51:00.836 --> 00:51:01.916
“What is this tree?”

00:51:01.946 --> 00:51:02.996
“Mother, we don't know.”

00:51:03.016 --> 00:51:04.976
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

00:51:04.996 --> 00:51:06.996
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

00:51:07.026 --> 00:51:08.826
I say, “What are these flowers?”

00:51:08.856 --> 00:51:09.906
“We don't know.”

00:51:10.826 --> 00:51:12.856
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,

00:51:12.876 --> 00:51:13.856
you don't know what are the trees,

00:51:13.886 --> 00:51:14.996
every day you watch them;

00:51:15.026 --> 00:51:17.906
you don't know what is the tree is?

00:51:20.916 --> 00:51:23.846
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?”

00:51:23.886 --> 00:51:24.996
they will know.

00:51:24.996 --> 00:51:26.816
“Mother, this is the place

00:51:26.856 --> 00:51:28.806
where they produced the best wines.”

00:51:28.816 --> 00:51:29.966
“All right, I'll see to it.”

00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:33.896
And next year they had no fermentation.

00:51:38.916 --> 00:51:43.781
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

00:51:43.806 --> 00:51:47.750
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

00:51:47.775 --> 00:51:48.996
that you go and aggress other countries,

00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:53.886
aggress other people and use all kinds of things;

00:51:56.866 --> 00:51:59.926
and that really is killing.

00:52:01.786 --> 00:52:04.856
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

00:52:04.896 --> 00:52:06.306
they think we are the Lord,

00:52:06.465 --> 00:52:07.896
we can hate anyone,

00:52:07.966 --> 00:52:09.806
we can aggress anyone,

00:52:09.836 --> 00:52:10.976
we could be arrogant with anyone,

00:52:11.026 --> 00:52:14.806
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

00:52:14.856 --> 00:52:17.449
take away anybody's child, take away anything,

00:52:17.474 --> 00:52:19.786
we can kill our children.

00:52:20.936 --> 00:52:25.916
As a result the love is lost;

00:52:25.996 --> 00:52:28.996
no question of compassion.

00:52:29.836 --> 00:52:32.946
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

00:52:35.996 --> 00:52:39.896
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

00:52:39.916 --> 00:52:41.916
sense of “my and mine”

00:52:42.946 --> 00:52:45.826
- is that this is my child,

00:52:46.806 --> 00:52:48.826
this is my country,

00:52:49.786 --> 00:52:53.936
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:58.026
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

00:52:58.836 --> 00:53:02.896
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

00:53:02.996 --> 00:53:07.946
This has come from the same root that,

00:53:07.976 --> 00:53:09.936
“This is mine, this is my country”.

00:53:09.966 --> 00:53:12.806
Why? How is it your country?

00:53:12.866 --> 00:53:15.886
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:20.026
You can't create little mud, can you?

00:53:22.026 --> 00:53:25.876
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

00:53:25.886 --> 00:53:27.996
This all belongs to God.

00:53:28.816 --> 00:53:31.936
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

00:53:32.846 --> 00:53:34.986
You have not created even so much;

00:53:35.026 --> 00:53:38.856
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

00:53:38.926 --> 00:53:44.016
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

00:53:44.846 --> 00:53:47.816
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis,

00:53:47.856 --> 00:53:52.856
very much. “My children”, this is the first curse.

00:53:54.856 --> 00:54:00.816
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

00:54:01.926 --> 00:54:04.826
it starts growing like that.

00:54:06.846 --> 00:54:09.986
Then the heart shrinks.

00:54:10.966 --> 00:54:15.258
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

00:54:15.528 --> 00:54:18.936
the whole thing is within,

00:54:18.966 --> 00:54:21.786
the whole thing is yours.

00:54:23.976 --> 00:54:28.946
When such a heart you experience within yourself

00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:31.290
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

00:54:31.369 --> 00:54:34.016
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

00:54:34.996 --> 00:54:37.976
No question of Sahasrara catching

00:54:38.856 --> 00:54:40.906
if you have a large heart.

00:54:41.836 --> 00:54:44.016
And to keep the Sahasrara open

00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:49.806
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

00:54:49.856 --> 00:54:52.886
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:54.916
Who is mine?

00:54:56.836 --> 00:54:58.946
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

00:54:59.016 --> 00:55:02.936
So get out of this small feeling.

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:06.806
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

00:55:06.866 --> 00:55:09.946
They get confined to their families.

00:55:11.856 --> 00:55:13.806
“My son hasn't got Realization,

00:55:13.856 --> 00:55:15.936
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

00:55:16.966 --> 00:55:20.826
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

00:55:20.856 --> 00:55:23.826
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

00:55:23.866 --> 00:55:27.806
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

00:55:27.836 --> 00:55:29.946
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

00:55:30.916 --> 00:55:33.826
Everyone is yours

00:55:35.956 --> 00:55:44.016
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

00:55:45.876 --> 00:55:47.876
pure love.

00:55:48.016 --> 00:55:52.796
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

00:55:52.936 --> 00:55:55.966
love everyone equally.

00:55:57.846 --> 00:55:58.966
When you say it is difficult

00:55:58.996 --> 00:56:01.796
that means you are not trying Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:01.996 --> 00:56:03.966
Enlarge your heart;

00:56:04.016 --> 00:56:05.996
you'll never feel lost.

00:56:06.816 --> 00:56:10.986
To Me, when I was leaving England I was really, little bit,

00:56:11.026 --> 00:56:15.826
I mean happens like that, like a moon sucks in the sea,

00:56:15.876 --> 00:56:19.856
you see, I felt My heart was just pulled out,

00:56:19.996 --> 00:56:25.826
but I reach here, again I see My children waiting for Me,

00:56:26.846 --> 00:56:28.966
so it's over, finished.

00:56:29.796 --> 00:56:32.966
It's there I felt, now here I feel

00:56:33.916 --> 00:56:39.846
that pull of My heart was released.

00:56:41.846 --> 00:56:45.826
You are also My children here and they are also My children.

00:56:45.876 --> 00:56:47.966
For a Mother like this, how can I say,

00:56:48.016 --> 00:56:50.936
“Oh, say this is Mine, this is Mine?”

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:57.966
So like this, try to break away from this conditioning.

00:56:57.996 --> 00:57:00.966
First, in the West people don't care for family;

00:57:00.996 --> 00:57:03.936
they'll divorce ten times and advertise it,

00:57:03.966 --> 00:57:06.856
“I am tenth time divorced lady."

00:57:07.796 --> 00:57:10.966
Now they don't divorce but so get attached

00:57:12.016 --> 00:57:14.956
with their family, with their husbands;

00:57:14.996 --> 00:57:17.876
like glue I tell you, like glue.

00:57:18.856 --> 00:57:19.966
Sometimes I start wondering,

00:57:20.016 --> 00:57:23.826
“What have I done to make them like this?”

00:57:24.996 --> 00:57:28.876
So now it is important to see these points,

00:57:28.926 --> 00:57:33.996
and ultimately the heart is the Sahasrara,

00:57:34.796 --> 00:57:36.016
or you can call the Brahmarandra,

00:57:36.816 --> 00:57:39.886
then we have to come to heart.

00:57:39.936 --> 00:57:43.886
Do not reason out, do not argue it out,

00:57:44.796 --> 00:57:48.846
don't work it out mentally from books or anywhere,

00:57:48.886 --> 00:57:50.796
but through your heart,

00:57:50.846 --> 00:57:51.886
if you work it out,

00:57:51.926 --> 00:57:55.926
you'll understand that nothing is more important

00:57:56.876 --> 00:57:59.816
than to love someone.

00:58:00.796 --> 00:58:05.956
And the highest thing is to love everyone equally.

00:58:06.796 --> 00:58:09.876
Of course in love you might have to say something

00:58:09.926 --> 00:58:11.856
to a person.

00:58:12.796 --> 00:58:15.629
The other day I had to say something to some Sahaja Yogini,

00:58:15.856 --> 00:58:16.806
so My husband said,

00:58:16.856 --> 00:58:18.565
“Don't say, she'll become Your enemy.”

00:58:18.796 --> 00:58:20.771
I said, “Let her become My enemy, it doesn't matter.

00:58:20.796 --> 00:58:23.826
It's My duty to tell her that this is wrong,

00:58:23.976 --> 00:58:28.841
otherwise I become her enemy because I don't… told her

00:58:28.866 --> 00:58:30.916
the truth and she will suffer.”

00:58:33.896 --> 00:58:36.916
So this is what it gives you discretion;

00:58:37.006 --> 00:58:40.856
and love is truth.

00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:44.806
So to this Kundalini,

00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:50.866
which is nothing but, is the river,

00:58:50.946 --> 00:58:53.866
as yesterday they described nirvaj,

00:58:54.896 --> 00:58:58.976
which doesn't accept any compensation.

00:58:59.806 --> 00:59:02.996
The river of that pure love

00:59:03.826 --> 00:59:05.886
which has awakened us with such love,

00:59:05.936 --> 00:59:07.916
kindness and tenderness,

00:59:07.966 --> 00:59:13.836
we should try to use that power within ourselves

00:59:13.896 --> 00:59:16.946
to be like that because our job is,

00:59:17.006 --> 00:59:19.856
She has given us Realization

00:59:19.916 --> 00:59:22.996
for the emancipation of the whole world,

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.886
not only our own.

00:59:24.936 --> 00:59:28.886
So everyone has to give Realization to others

00:59:28.936 --> 00:59:31.916
otherwise their Kundalini will settle back.

00:59:32.866 --> 00:59:36.926
Talk about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is not part time,

00:59:37.836 --> 00:59:40.916
it is not a side issue, it should be always with you.

00:59:40.906 --> 00:59:42.896
Wherever you get a chance you have to talk

00:59:42.926 --> 00:59:44.906
about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out,

00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:48.956
you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.

00:59:50.016 --> 00:59:52.876
May God bless you all.
