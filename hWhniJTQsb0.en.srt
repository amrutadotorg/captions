Abraham Lincoln: I still have a dream. It is
a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

2
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:22,182
I have a dream that one day, this nation
will rise up, live out the true meaning of

3
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:31,092
it's creed.We hold these truths to be self
-evident that all men are created equal.

4
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:39,786
[APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:49,982
I have a dream that one day on the Red Hills
of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the

6
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:57,497
sons of former slave owners, will they be able
to sit down together at the table of brotherhood?

7
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:05,087
I have a dream, so let freedom ring from
the prodigious hill-tops of New Hampshire,

8
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:12,326
let freedom ring from the mighty mountains
of New York, let freedom ring from the

9
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:19,359
heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania, let
freedom ring from the snow-capped
Rockies of Colorado

10
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:26,379
let freedom ring from the curvaceous 
slopes of California but not only that,

11
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:36,701
let freedom ring from Stone mountain of
Georgia, let freedom ring from Lookout
mountain of Tennessee,

12
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:45,365
let freedom ring from every hill and mole-hill
of Mississippi, from every mountain side,

13
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:55,457
let freedom ring and when this happens,
when we allow freedom ring, when we

14
00:01:55,457 --> 00:02:02,002
let it ring from every village and every 
hamlet, from every state and every city,

15
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:09,739
we will be able to speed up that day when all
of God's children - black men and white men,

16
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:17,535
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,
will be able to join hands and sing in the words

17
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:26,328
of the old Negro Spiritual, "Free at last, free at last,
thank God Almighty, we are free at last."

19
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:53,651
[MUSIC]

20
00:02:53,735 --> 00:03:07,475
[MUSIC]

21
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:23,624

22
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:42,530
[MUSIC]

23
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,287
Shri Mataji: We have to say that, America
is a great country in the universe. It has

24
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:55,300
the place of the Vishuddhi chakra, which
is the center of responsibility and discretion

25
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,817
and they have been so responsible, so far.
They have given such noble ideas of democracy

26
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:09,879
and of freedom and all those things which
are really all belonging to God's ideas

27
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,863
and when they talk of all these things, we
must know that there is something much more

28
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:20,027
that they can give to the whole world. So
many saints are born in this country

29
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:24,310
because they realize that this is the
country where they'll be able to prosper

30
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,879
better into their spirituality, so it is a
very great responsibility of Americans

31
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,903
to understand that we have had great
leaders, we have had great noble ideas, we

32
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:40,082
have got great saints living here - so many
are anxious to come down here. Only thing

33
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:45,539
what we have to do, is to establish within
ourselves our Spirit and to be ready and

34
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,518
prepared for this great tremendous work
that is going to come now and this is what

35
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:56,605
the world has to do. If emancipation of
the humanity has to take place, it has to

36
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:01,828
take place only from inside out and not 
outside in. Another thing I would like to

37
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:07,551
tell that the danger is not from the outside
for America, not from anywhere else, it is

38
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:13,516
from within themselves, so be careful. We
have to be careful about ourselves the way

39
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:18,899
we are destroying. When we say, "What's wrong?"
we go headlong into our destructions.

40
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:24,636
Human beings should not take freedom
as abandonment but freedom to enjoy

41
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,679
completely and fully; The freedom that
takes you to a destruction, is not freedom

42
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:35,837
and the right idea of freedom must be taken
and people should know that freedom,

43
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:43,620
ultimate freedom is, when you become your
own master, when there are no habits, when

44
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,939
you cannot be dominated by anything - you
are above everything - that's the freedom

45
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,173
you have to achieve and that is why people
talk, long time back in this country,

46
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:56,957
about freedom, they help all the countries
to get their freedom and now it is their

47
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:03,212
job to get them their own freedom within
themselves, so that others will also follow.

48
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,462
May God bless you all!
