1
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:09,190
This is the first time we are having a puja in Brisbane,

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,150
and I'm happy so many have come here

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,470
from various places.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,070
You know that by puja you,

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,070
you excite the Chakras within Me

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,230
and you get lots of vibrations,

7
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,310
and you achieve,

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,950
suddenly, a height in your awareness.

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,110
You do achieve that, but

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,990
after some time they say that:

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,550
Mother, again we come down.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,630
Also, they were saying that:

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,830
"When we go to India we are all right,

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,910
and when we come back, again we come down."

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,150
Luckily, now we have an Ashram,

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,830
which is a very good thing.

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,030
To have an ashram itself is a, I must say,

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,750
is a very, very

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,150
positive thing because

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,950
that is how Ganesha is established here.

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,070
So Ashram is here for a collective living,

22
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,950
but a collective living of spirituality.

23
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,790
It's not just living here, but it is of spirituality.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,790
And we have to know certain things about

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,230
the discipline that we have to keep,

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,750
which is very important.

27
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,070
It's not just a house where are, some people

28
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,590
have gathered together to live together,

29
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,630
but it has to have a discipline.

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,230
Then only you'll be helped

31
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,750
because if you do not come

32
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,230
to the Ashram with this idea

33
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,390
that you are going there to ascend yourself,

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,030
it will make no difference

35
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,150
whether you stay in the house

36
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,230
or you go in the Ashram.

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,110
So there are two types of meditation,

38
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,830
two types,

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,830
where one is the meditation where -

40
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,030
we can call it the antarmana -

41
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,630
that we meditate inside ourselves,

42
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,390
to see for ourselves what's wrong with us,

43
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,030
and how we have to correct,

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,710
what we have to do about it.

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,270
And another is bahir mana,

46
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,710
which is outside,

47
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,030
how we have to live outside.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,390
You have to have a discipline,

49
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,110
which is not imposed on you

50
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,710
but, very happily,

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,670
which you have

52
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,990
accepted

53
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,670
and have imbibed.

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,870
For any art, say in India, I don't know here, but

55
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,990
you have to put yourself into a rigorous training

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,070
to achieve any height.

57
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,510
You cannot haphazardly move about it.

58
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,030
You cannot take just easily everything.

59
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,070
In Sahaja Yoga there is no tapascharya,

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,710
there is no penance for you.

61
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,510
It's all blessings.

62
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,190
But one should not get lost with those blessings,

63
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,590
if you have to really get into yourself

64
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,190
in its full depth.

65
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,150
So, for the antarmana it is important

66
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,110
that you all should meditate,

67
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,670
morning and evening, every day.

68
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,830
Is all right even if you do not brush your teeth,

69
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,070
but you must meditate is an important thing.

70
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,030
That is the reason I find that in the West

71
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,030
people go on catching,

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,070
again cleaning, again catching.

73
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,750
Every time I come... [I] find somebody is suffering

74
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,230
from either... for some sort of a conditioning,

75
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,670
or say, some sort of a baddha,

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,190
or sometimes it's ego or something.

77
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,150
It comes and goes.

78
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,590
It is not something that is detached permanently.

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,310
As we have to take our bath every day,

80
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,350
we have to wash ourselves every day,

81
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,070
in the same way we have to wash ourselves within.

82
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,110
So meditation is the antarmana

83
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,590
tapaha, as you can call it.

84
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,830
But it's not such a Tapaha even.

85
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,030
You don't have to go to Himalayas and sit there.

86
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,670
You have to just do this meditation

87
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,350
early in the morning.

88
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,350
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

89
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,830
I would say the best that is working out

90
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,110
is in Germany and in Austria, these two;

91
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,910
and also England, but not to that extent.

92
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,350
I would say these two are working out the best;

93
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,910
and thirdly, in Rome.

94
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,070
They too have ashrams of the same kind,

95
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,150
but for them it is very important to achieve

96
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,550
the heights of Sahaja Yoga.

97
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,870
Absolutely. Nothing is more important.

98
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,070
Invariably, in all these ashrams

99
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,910
I've seen people get up at four o'clock.

100
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,310
I also get up every day at four.

101
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,150
Then I may sleep later on,

102
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,470
but at four o'clock I am up.

103
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,590
They take their baths,

104
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,310
get ready for the pujas,

105
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,230
and then sit down and do about

106
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,950
five, ten minutes puja of the photograph,

107
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,790
and then meditate.

108
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,430
Then they go and have some breakfast or something.

109
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,870
Then when they come home from work,

110
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,430
also they sit down together to meditate,

111
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,910
that's the collective part of it,

112
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,150
or discuss whatever is to be done, what,

113
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,910
how are we to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

114
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,710
They just talk about Sahaja Yoga,

115
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,270
or they decide what should be done,

116
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,110
what is the best way

117
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,110
to solve the problems of Sahaja Yoga.

118
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,230
And then in the night, before sleeping,

119
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,230
invariably all of them,  all of them,

120
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,910
one and all, even children before sleeping,

121
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,470
soak their feet in the water,

122
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,110
sit for meditation, and sleep.

123
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,430
That's why I find Austria has come up so well,

124
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,870
and Germans.

125
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,110
You know, Germans are like that.

126
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,830
If something gets into their heads,

127
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,030
for them that's the most important thing;

128
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,070
then they do not sort of fickle out.

129
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,150
There's no...

130
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,110
they don't have any compromises on those points.

131
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,830
And they make their body work hard.

132
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,830
Now, what is the Tapa in this thing here

133
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,670
- the penance?

134
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,110
That our body is used to some sort of a life.

135
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,150
India also, we are all like that in India

136
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,390
- everybody will get up in the morning,

137
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,350
and they will sit for puja,

138
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,030
or they will sit for meditation.

139
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,310
I mean, that goes without saying,

140
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,470
you don't have to tell them.

141
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,990
Because that's the traditional thing to do in India:

142
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,390
always when they get up, have their bath,

143
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,830
they always do some puja,

144
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,950
all of them.

145
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,030
If they're Christians, also, they'll sit down and pray.

146
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,510
Muslims, they'll do namaaz.

147
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,230
That's a kind of a practice,

148
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,790
and the breeding of the family.

149
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,550
Here I find that the parents

150
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,230
do not take the responsibility

151
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,630
to pass on any information to children

152
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,710
about disciplining themselves,

153
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,350
because children are also extremely aggressive.

154
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,310
They don't want to know about it.

155
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,030
So the parents also dare not tell them

156
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,270
that: "It is good for you, please do it this way;

157
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,910
it is better that you meditate."

158
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,870
They're afraid that they may lose their children

159
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,430
if they tell them like this.

160
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,150
Or, "You pray", or "You get up at this time".

161
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,150
You dare not tell them that you get up at this time.

162
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,870
This is the greatest crime in the West

163
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,030
if you tell them that:

164
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,790
"You have to get up at four o'clock" - amah!

165
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,710
It's like the worst punishment.

166
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,630
But once you start getting up in the morning,

167
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,070
you'll get the habit, and then you'll sleep early.

168
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,030
Then you can sleep early.

169
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,030
Getting up in the morning, really,

170
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,350
will help you for the whole day.

171
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,910
So start this kind of a practice.

172
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,910
You must meditate every day,

173
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,910
and this is the reason why I find people,

174
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,510
whenever I come, they're again caught up,

175
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,590
something gone wrong.

176
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,190
This is wrong, that is wrong;

177
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,630
they're caught up here and there. Why should you?

178
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,710
Day by day, you must rise.

179
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,630
Day by day, you should be at a much higher state,

180
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,070
and this new breeding has to come within us,

181
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,230
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

182
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,550
And we are not here only,

183
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,910
just to have good food and to have a nice time

184
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,830
or nice meetings, but we are here

185
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,990
to become those unique personalities,

186
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,910
which are required to raise the humanity

187
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,110
to a higher state.

188
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,070
So you have to be, now, responsible for yourself.

189
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,510
You have to look after yourself

190
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,550
and you have to tell yourself:

191
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,870
"Mr. So-and-so, Mrs. So-and-so,

192
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,950
please now behave yourself."

193
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,990
Otherwise, Sahaja Yoga is lost to you.

194
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,710
It's not going to help you much.

195
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,150
We might increase in quantity,

196
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,950
but quality-wise we'll be missing;

197
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,150
and one attack of negativity can finish

198
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,310
such a quantity that we think is too much

199
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,670
- it has happened once.

200
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,950
So now, all of you must develop

201
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,390
that dedication to yourself,

202
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,150
to find out what's your problem,

203
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,870
and how you have to correct it.

204
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,030
If it is done every day, I can assure you,

205
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,230
you will have no problem of any kind.

206
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,310
Your thoughts will stop,

207
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,510
your problems will be solved,

208
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,150
and you'll have no catches at all,

209
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,070
because you have washed them off.

210
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,390
But if you leave them on your being,

211
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,070
then they grow, and they become big.

212
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,110
So there should be no lethargy,

213
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,870
as far as meditation is concerned,

214
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,750
but joyfully you'll start doing, after some time.

215
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,950
You won't be happy if you have not done it.

216
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,510
But in the beginning you'll have to goad yourself,

217
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,350
and tell yourself

218
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,830
that this body has to be cleaned;

219
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,470
but more than that body,

220
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,750
this mind and intellect, both of them,

221
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,350
are to be corrected.

222
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,910
To be an instrument of God,

223
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,030
you have to be perfect,

224
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,310
perfect personality,

225
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,070
otherwise we may not be able to communicate

226
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,870
the message of Sahaja Yoga in the proper way.

227
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,030
Many people say that:

228
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,830
"We are surrendered to Mother,

229
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,070
and we are surrendered to Her,

230
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,230
and as surrendering we'll get everything."

231
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,990
But what are you surrendering?

232
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,430
Is that a clean heart,

233
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,070
or a heart full of all kinds of wrong things?

234
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,470
Or is that the intelligence,

235
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,270
which is a very superior type of clean intelligence?

236
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,110
Or else, are you coming out

237
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,990
with all your arrogance?

238
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,070
So though there is the Ganges of Sahaja Yoga flowing,

239
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,230
still you have to have the depth of a pitcher.

240
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,110
A stone cannot fetch any water.

241
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,310
Same with children.

242
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,470
Of course, as they'll be going to India,

243
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,190
I am sure they'll form proper routines,

244
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,070
and they'll form proper meditation methods.

245
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,790
It is obvious that we have never had

246
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,830
the sense of Divinity in the West.

247
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,470
Whatever we had, whatever we got

248
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,150
from the church or from any

249
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,270
synagogue or something like that,

250
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,110
which was only Sunday to Sunday, Sunday to Sunday;

251
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,350
for a Muslim it is Friday to Friday, Friday to Friday,

252
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,150
finished.

253
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,070
But that has led them nowhere.

254
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,310
So we have to do something about it.

255
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,430
Problems will be solved in no time.

256
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,350
You don't have to sit down and contemplate

257
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,390
and worry: how will you solve your problem?

258
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,390
It will be solved.

259
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,230
But what cannot be solved

260
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,390
is the habits you have developed,

261
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,710
habits of lethargy.

262
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,990
I can understand in London

263
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,750
if the people are lethargic, but they are not.

264
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,150
They have become extremely,

265
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,110
extremely hardworking,

266
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,430
active,

267
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,790
and also dedicated.

268
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,590
How they have achieved it?

269
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,870
Only by knowing that this dedication brings forth

270
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,230
all the cleansing, and all the powers.

271
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,430
Now, supposing this instrument is not clean.

272
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,550
You won't be able to even hear Me,

273
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,430
it is useless.

274
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,990
So our instrument has to be perfect

275
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,030
to manifest Sahaja Yoga.

276
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,550
If it is not, all the defects can have double effects;

277
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,230
like, first it will affect you,

278
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:58,350
you can never feel the full advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

279
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,750
and secondly it will affect the people who will meet you,

280
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,510
and gradually they'll find out

281
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,310
there's something wrong with you.

282
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,070
"Some sort of a subdued madness",

283
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,510
they'll say, "this Sahaja Yoga is,

284
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,030
because I don't find anything great about this man.

285
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,270
He's halfway here and halfway there."

286
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,870
Once you start getting deeper into your being,

287
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,470
you'll be amazed that you can develop

288
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,910
such capacities

289
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,030
that you will be amazed at yourself.

290
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,390
Of course, there are blessings, there are miracles,

291
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,710
but think of your own capacities.

292
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,430
What are your capacities?

293
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,310
How far are you able to do

294
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,350
something about curing people?

295
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,870
We have few people in Bombay,

296
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,550
and very few people in Pune also.

297
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,030
But they are available for curing.

298
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,950
Some of them are going to villages.

299
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,510
Now they have asked Me to give them a jeep,

300
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,230
so they could take a music party to the villages

301
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,870
and sing there,

302
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,350
and achieve

303
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,590
a greater number of Sahaja Yogis.

304
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,790
But when they come back, immediately,

305
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,670
whether they come in the daytime or in the night,

306
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,150
immediately they wash their feet

307
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,230
before the photograph.

308
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,310
Also to protect yourself,

309
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,030
you have to give yourself a bandhan,

310
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,030
all the time.

311
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,150
It is not you should say: "Now, I'm all right."

312
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,230
You should not say that: "I am perfect."

313
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,230
You should not say: "Now I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

314
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,030
Never, never think like that.

315
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,230
The moment you start thinking you are perfect,

316
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,230
you are finished.

317
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,510
So before going out, you must give a proper bandhan.

318
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,910
Also before sleeping you must give a proper bandhan.

319
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,110
Put your attention to your Sahasrara and then sleep.

320
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,070
It's very amazing how things work out.

321
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,230
Immediately you will know a person

322
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,030
is meditating or not, immediately.

323
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,270
It's like he is a person who

324
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,430
has given a bath to the child.

325
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,150
Though he has given a bath to the child,

326
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,590
still he has not taken a bath.

327
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,310
You can make it out, the difference between the two.

328
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,150
In the same way, those who have been meditating

329
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,470
every day, morning and evening,

330
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,070
not much time needed.

331
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,630
You see, we waste all our time

332
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,390
in something nonsensical.

333
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,710
When there is complete understanding of yourself,

334
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,790
and complete understanding of these vibrations,

335
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:25,990
then only you can handle them properly.

336
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,870
All this knowledge is for you.

337
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,030
Is absolutely free as you know,

338
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,310
and all this mastery can be yours.

339
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,150
So do not just get satisfied:

340
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,710
"All right, today's Sunday, we'll go to the church,

341
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,030
take the hymn book, let us sing this hymn number

342
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,110
such-and-such, again sit down, get up, sit down."

343
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,910
Come back home just the same.

344
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:01,390
So today I have really thought of telling all of you

345
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,790
that you have to develop the depth within yourself.

346
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,590
And if you cannot develop that depth,

347
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,070
then you are still a mediocre.

348
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,510
Actually all these great secrets about the Goddess

349
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,790
or Her powers, were not told to anyone like that.

350
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,390
Never.

351
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:36,390
Only when they had completed their oneness

352
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,670
- I would say the full idea, full understanding

353
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,030
between the oneness of God

354
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,150
and your relationship with that,

355
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,470
absolutely –

356
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,710
nobody would do anything before that.

357
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,670
Now the days are, of Sahaja Yoga, are so simple

358
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,150
that as soon as you get Realization,

359
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,110
you can start giving Realization to others.

360
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,270
Immediately.

361
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,230
Just under your hand you will see

362
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,870
the Kundalini will move.

363
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,430
You put your hand on somebody's head,

364
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,390
and you'll find that person gets realization.

365
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,430
It's a fact.

366
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,830
It just works that way.

367
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,870
But that means, for many:

368
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,830
"Oh, there's nothing to be done.

369
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,270
After all, is all done by Mother,

370
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,670
we have just achieved something."

371
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,310
You can always understand that

372
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,030
Mother can only work out a very good instrument,

373
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,630
and not a weak instrument.

374
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:54,870
So now, we have some very great Sahaja Yogis

375
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,990
who have gone very deep into it.

376
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,990
Invariably, whenever I asked,

377
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,150
they say: "Mother, every day we worship.

378
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,790
We worship morning and evening, every way, day.

379
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,150
We either wash our feet

380
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,030
and sit down before Your photograph

381
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,950
and worship Your photograph,

382
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,550
or else in the morning time also

383
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,230
we do something like that."

384
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,590
And amazingly, you can make them out immediately.

385
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,310
There may be six hundred people at the airport,

386
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,750
but immediately I know

387
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,190
who has been meditating every day.

388
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,470
Now, it is for us.

389
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,550
We have been doing Sahaja Yoga for the last,

390
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,070
now, more than twenty years,

391
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,070
and now we are entering into twenty-first year,

392
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,150
we can say; but I'm ready, you see, it is like that,

393
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,110
because now it was 1970, and now it is 1990,

394
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,670
so it is all this thing, plus ninety-one.

395
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,030
So much time we have had.

396
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,270
Of course, I would say,

397
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,190
you didn't get your Realization at that time;

398
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,390
but whatever time you got the Realization,

399
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,230
I did not judge how far you were in it.

400
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,150
I said: "First let them have their Realization."

401
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,790
They got their Realization.

402
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,870
So once they got their Realization, you see,

403
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,790
people who have really

404
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,230
felt the responsibility,

405
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,470
from the very first day they got to it,

406
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,790
from the very first day.

407
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,310
I didn't have to tell them.

408
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,550
I'm not talking about Indians, I'm talking about others.

409
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,750
And they have done, they have shown

410
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,870
tremendous improvement, tremendous.

411
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,230
We have been sending you Indian boys from there,

412
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,030
Indian girls from there,

413
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,750
just for you to know that

414
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,990
they can also help you in Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,790
Definitely can help you.

416
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,670
You have to have a proper type of a person,

417
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,790
and you'll be amazed at the way they are,

418
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,990
that they can impart everything,

419
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:30,910
and they are least bothered about their ego.

420
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,870
There's no ego at all.

421
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,030
So you are not achieving all this for your ego.

422
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,910
You are achieving it because

423
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,990
you are a seeker,

424
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,710
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

425
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,510
So it is to be understood that it's not

426
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,950
something like a advantage in money wise,

427
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,030
or something that I have to have a power,

428
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,150
this, that;

429
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,230
because if you do not meditate,

430
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,070
your attention will go to such things.

431
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,510
Immediately you'll start thinking:

432
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,910
Can I become the leader?

433
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,150
All right, if not: "Should I debase the leader?

434
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,150
How can I insult him?

435
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,510
How can I fight for that? How can I do that?

436
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,630
How can I work it out this way?"

437
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,630
You try to insult also.

438
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,510
If not possible, you might use violence sometimes,

439
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,430
anger,

440
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,870
because you are not yet, I should say,

441
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,950
that much evolve, evolved,

442
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,030
so much mature, so much wiser.

443
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,310
So now, what you have to do

444
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,310
is to... at the very

445
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,030
first shot when you get up in the morning,

446
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,150
you first say that: "Let me see,

447
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,190
what is my responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi?"

448
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,230
After some time you will start enjoying it,

449
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,470
because it will give you such tremendous powers,

450
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,790
such tremendous experience.

451
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,830
Now then, you just sit down with very humble mind,

452
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,150
and first of all say: "Mother, if I have any ego, please take away.

453
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,030
Mother, if I have any conditioning,

454
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,230
please take away; because

455
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,790
I'm a seeker out and out,

456
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,150
I don't want all these things."

457
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,070
But if you do not meditate,

458
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,070
then this Mr. Ego will secretly crawl upon you,

459
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,230
and you may try to become the leader,

460
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,870
or some sort of an assertion you'll do,

461
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,510
some sort of a stupid ego actions,

462
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,870
which we have many in Sahaja Yoga.

463
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,470
If you write them down,

464
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,270
you will not know how to stop laughing.

465
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,190
So to warn yourself, I would say that

466
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,310
the only way to protect yourself is to do

467
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,790
the meditation in the morning and evening,

468
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:04,270
and also to keep yourself in complete bandhan.

469
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,990
Yours is a very important role

470
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,590
and a very important time,

471
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,950
extremely important.

472
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,270
You have no idea,

473
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,270
that in the history of spirituality

474
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,110
no one could do so much as you can do.

475
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,790
So, if you really

476
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,950
do the Antarmana,

477
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,670
if you really see inside yourself,

478
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,830
while meditating you see yourself, your chakras and all that,

479
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,870
and then you find out this introspection:

480
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,830
Why am I like this?

481
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,190
Just separate from yourself, see for yourself:

482
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,950
"Why am I like this? Why I did like this?

483
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,110
Why do I think like this? Who am I?"

484
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,070
These questions when answered,

485
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,070
you will know all your worth, your value.

486
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,390
I do not know how much I should stress,

487
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,150
how much more is needed to stress

488
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,350
the importance of meditation, every day.

489
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,070
Like these advertisements you see,

490
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,150
every day they just go on bombarding

491
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,230
on your head, and:

492
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:43,910
Buy this, buy that, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.

493
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,950
It acts.

494
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,030
In the same way, you have to every day

495
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,310
bombard yourself: "Now, meditation.

496
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,030
Get to meditation. Get to meditation."

497
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,990
Then you'll be surprised

498
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,350
that when you'll go out, you'll see something beautiful;

499
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,990
immediately you'll get into thoughtless awareness.

500
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,230
Don't have to do.

501
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,110
As soon as you'll meet a Sahaja Yogi, immediately into thoughtless;

502
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,430
the other person, you both will go.

503
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,310
Everything you start enjoying in a very different manner.

504
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,230
And such beautiful feelings come in,

505
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:25,630
such beautiful security is built up

506
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,710
that you are surprised:

507
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,070
"How I could be like that?

508
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,510
How I could feel these securities just expressing

509
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,110
themselves in such a beautiful manner?"

510
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:47,470
Because if you are, say, washed and clean

511
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,790
- simple thing, everyday life –

512
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,070
then before touching any, everything you are careful

513
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,950
that you don't again spoil them.

514
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,630
If there's a sari, which is dirty, absolutely dirty,

515
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,070
then if there are two spots or hundred spots,

516
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,870
makes no difference.

517
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,310
But when it is absolutely clean, then

518
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,470
even the slightest spot you can get worried,

519
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,910
because everybody will see that.

520
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,110
In the same way,

521
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,750
unless and until you cleanse yourself every day,

522
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,790
you will not know what's wrong with you.

523
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,990
I hope you'll pay full attention to what I've said here today,

524
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,150
with full attention

525
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,590
on your inner being

526
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,710
projecting out,

527
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,150
like a witness to yourself.

528
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,150
Just see how you talk to others:

529
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,550
"Why should I talk like that?

530
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,150
What is the need to talk?"

531
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,910
And then you'll start understanding

532
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,830
that behind all this

533
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,110
is some sort of a funny thing going on in my brain,

534
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,670
and this brain has to be corrected

535
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,550
- Very important.

536
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:25,230
Now, at the end of the day we should find out:

537
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:29,390
What good things I have done for Sahaja Yoga?

538
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:37,190
Also, we can find out, "How I have been

539
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,350
not up to the point in Sahaja Yoga?"

540
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,710
If it could be done,

541
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,870
you find out: "How far I have gone

542
00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:00,030
with these powers to spread Sahaja Yoga?

543
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,590
How far I can go?"

544
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,390
It's really remarkable because,

545
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,710
as I told you, in Austria we have some boys

546
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,030
who are all the time researching about Sahaja Yoga.

547
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,030
They have read the book of Adi Shankaracharya,

548
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,910
which I have not yet read.

549
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,830
They have read all kinds of things,

550
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,910
just to find out how far they are,

551
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,510
and as a result

552
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,670
they themselves went on developing

553
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,590
very, very deep into their beings;

554
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,710
but the way, you see,

555
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:46,310
you go on developing deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,

556
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,950
and you'll be amazed the deeper you go,

557
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,790
you won't show off, you won't show off.

558
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,030
You'll just emit.

559
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,990
Like, one gentleman once came to My house

560
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,230
and they said, "Mother, some cooler has come inside.

561
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,990
It looks some cooler has come inside. Ya, ya, there's a cooler coming."

562
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,710
He didn't say anything, didn't do anything.

563
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,070
Just walking inside the house:

564
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,070
Some cooler has come.

565
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,150
You just felt, you know;

566
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,870
like in the forest if you go,

567
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,590
and you find complete silence, even the birds are not twittering,

568
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,310
then know there's a tiger sitting there.

569
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,830
Tiger doesn't do anything; it's just sleeping maybe, poor thing.

570
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,550
But the whole place is awed by his presence, you see.

571
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,470
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi, anywhere, will stand out.

572
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,230
Look at these saints, they didn't know

573
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,230
how to raise even the Kundalini,

574
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,190
but they were very pure people.

575
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,070
They never raised anybody's Kundalini.

576
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,030
They never gave Realization to anyone.

577
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,030
They were extremely pure people.

578
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,550
There was no impurity left in them.

579
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,910
And so, how much they could produce:

580
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,910
what poetry, what work,

581
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,150
what spiritual, spiritual ideas,

582
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,830
what sayings; I mean, tremendous –

583
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,670
such depth in whatever they did,

584
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,270
such effectiveness.

585
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,230
Now, we are here to gain our spirituality,

586
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,070
not to gain money,

587
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:32,590
not to gain positions,

588
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,750
powers - nothing. We are here to gain our spirituality,

589
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,870
and in that spirituality, it's all there.

590
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,870
All the satisfaction,

591
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,110
everything is there.

592
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,670
It will have an effect on the children.

593
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,070
It will have an effect on the surroundings,

594
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,390
in every way, and the personality.

595
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,670
So it's not a question also individuals doing that,

596
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,230
but collectively doing it.

597
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,710
The collective should look a beautiful thing.

598
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,710
So you should have, I would say, in an ashram,

599
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,790
a collective meditation.

600
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,230
In Austria they do it early in the morning,

601
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,430
four o'clock, collectively.

602
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,230
So they know how many are there,

603
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,950
and how many are missing, this, that.

604
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,030
But I said: "Don't point out. Let's see."

605
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,510
When those who have been doing meditation like that

606
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,030
rise so high, others start following them.

607
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,550
So don't think about others: what time he got up.

608
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,870
It's I; I have to look after myself.

609
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,270
It's very selfish: Swarth.

610
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,710
You have to know the meaning of Swa

611
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,430
- that is selfishness –

612
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,030
and when you know that meaning, then you are not bothered

613
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,030
whatsoever anybody might say, whatsoever anyone may try to do.

614
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,070
Supposing your husband is funny:

615
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,670
Oh, doesn't matter. He'll come round.

616
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,230
Supposing your wife is funny: Doesn't matter, she'll come round.

617
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:22,150
Is nothing important. To you, this is the most important thing to do,

618
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,230
and all those who have thought like this

619
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,270
and have acted like this,

620
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,190
were above everything.

621
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,390
Nothing can put them down.

622
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,550
So, today is the first day of Brisbane.

623
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,310
I bless you all, that you should have

624
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,630
this full idea about yourself,

625
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,750
why you are on this earth,

626
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,310
and what great work you are supposed to do.

627
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,550
Each one of you is capable.

628
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,550
Each one of you can do it,

629
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,830
but you... I would request you

630
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,950
that you imbibe these qualities within you,

631
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,550
which are already there.

632
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,550
I mean, I wouldn't say "imbibe", but you manifest them,

633
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,710
and once you start manifesting,

634
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,790
see your temperament how it is.

635
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,710
We'll look after your children; don't worry.

636
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,790
May God bless you.
