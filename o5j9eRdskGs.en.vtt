WEBVTT

01:22.800 --> 01:36.520
Today we are celebrating the Birthday of Shri
Ganesha, because it is a very important thing

01:36.700 --> 01:42.060
for all of us that we should celebrate His
Birthday; and yesterday we did the Havana.

01:42.070 --> 01:55.360
But yesterday we had many new people so I
could not talk to you very clearly about Shri

01:55.360 --> 01:57.580
Ganesha’s deeper manifestations.

01:57.580 --> 02:14.140
You know that He resides within us.

02:14.140 --> 02:44.350
We have a very great asset within us that
we know about Shri Ganesha, and that we can

02:44.350 --> 02:49.750
excite His powers.

02:49.750 --> 03:13.190
To manifest Shri Ganesha, we have to do certain
amount of Tapasya, Penance.

03:13.190 --> 03:49.360
First we have to say, when we sit for meditation,
that, “I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation.

03:49.360 --> 04:06.099
Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by
You, and my only desire is to please You”.

04:06.099 --> 04:18.470
Then you sit down in complete preparedness,
meditating over your Mooladhara, putting your

04:18.470 --> 04:24.180
attention to it with absolute purity.

04:24.180 --> 04:41.300
Now you have my photograph before you and
you tell the photograph that, “Mother, You are

04:41.300 --> 04:51.150
Shri Ganesha.

04:51.150 --> 04:56.060
You give me wisdom and discretion”.

04:56.060 --> 05:08.590
So, attention at the mooladhara chakra, which
is actually below the sacrum bone.

05:08.590 --> 05:22.840
You put your right hand towards the photograph,
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

05:22.840 --> 05:50.350
Now this will tell you that your mind, or
your brain which is full of confusion, which

05:50.350 --> 06:05.070
has no discretion, which is complicated, which
does the same mistakes again and again, which

06:05.070 --> 06:38.900
does not understand how to cure the ills of
bad feelings, all that can be cured if you

06:38.900 --> 06:51.120
put your right hand towards me and the left
hand towards the Mother Earth.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.169
So, in action you do like that.

06:54.169 --> 07:06.389
Now as He is the ‘essence’ of everything’
that is material, that has bhava , that has

07:06.389 --> 07:08.620
been created.

07:08.620 --> 07:17.310
He is the essence of everything that has been
created.

07:17.310 --> 07:21.680
‘Through Him’ everything has been created.

07:21.680 --> 07:37.810
When you develop that, you develop your sense
of subtle creativity, and the sense of subtle

07:37.810 --> 07:44.580
appreciation of creativity.

07:44.580 --> 08:01.979
Then you develop your discretion of how to
behave with others, in a beautiful manner,

08:01.979 --> 08:06.660
so that your ego is controlled.

08:06.660 --> 08:18.870
The behaviour should be such that there should
be no expression of ego in your behaviour.

08:18.870 --> 08:23.199
Your Mother is a good example.

08:23.199 --> 08:39.930
I think you know that I know quite a lot of
things, but I never show off, nor ever assert

08:39.930 --> 08:45.370
that I am so knowledgeable.

08:45.370 --> 09:01.380
1 live like a very very ordinary person with
you, and I do not in any way assert my personality

09:01.380 --> 09:07.270
that gives you a shock.

09:07.270 --> 09:18.791
So, with your intelligence or with your other
powers -like if you are a moneyed man or if

09:18.791 --> 09:33.480
you are more efficient, or anything, you should
not try to impress on others.

09:33.480 --> 09:45.620
But you must deal with it beautifully.

09:45.620 --> 09:52.790
So the beauty comes when you are efficient
“and” you are loving.

09:52.790 --> 09:59.490
That is the central point, that is the result.

09:59.490 --> 10:10.170
That you are knowledgeable and you are humble.

10:10.170 --> 10:19.130
That you know everything about everyone but
you are discreet.

10:19.130 --> 10:43.399
So in effect it is a complete personality
that can only give that kind of a very soothing

10:43.399 --> 10:46.769
effect.

10:46.769 --> 11:00.399
So the soothing effect comes as a result of
beauty.

11:00.399 --> 11:08.970
So to develop it you have to meditate on your
mooladhara chakra.

11:08.970 --> 11:18.910
I have seen many people get fanatic about
Sahaja Yoga also.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.730
They think they are the real Napoleons or
Shivaji!

11:20.730 --> 11:35.700
In Marathi we call him Shivaji, but Shivaji
was a much better person than Napoleon, better

11:35.700 --> 11:39.029
to call him Napoleon.

11:39.029 --> 11:49.860
Then they start guiding you in everything
-“This is not good, that is not good.

11:49.860 --> 11:51.570
Tam a very great Sahaja Yogi!

11:51.570 --> 12:04.730
You are like this,” and all that, and very
hot tempered because they are fanatics.

12:04.730 --> 12:06.029
Fanaticism and temper goes together.

12:06.029 --> 12:12.060
There is no love in fanaticism.

12:12.060 --> 12:23.360
If you tell them don’t be a fanatic, they
will start crying.

12:23.360 --> 12:30.332
So the fanaticism of Sahaja Yoga is most blinding.

12:30.332 --> 12:35.840
It is something like, in front of the Temple
of God you beg from other people for money.

12:35.840 --> 12:53.550
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which should not
lead you to ‘any’ fanaticism.

12:53.550 --> 13:06.940
You have to be prasanna-chitta, which means
you should be a very happy, joyous personality;

13:06.940 --> 13:14.440
and not a tense, abrupt person.

13:14.440 --> 13:30.120
But this only achieves it’s maximum result
when everything is done in complete innocence.

13:30.120 --> 13:34.600
But many people confuse innocence with stupidity.

13:34.600 --> 13:40.149
They think, to be stupid is innocent.

13:40.149 --> 13:49.010
And a stupid man gets into an ego trip in
no time.

13:49.010 --> 13:54.269
Innocence is the wisest thing.

13:54.269 --> 14:00.339
You ‘cannot’ befool innocence, that’s
the main thing.

14:00.339 --> 14:07.431
No one can befool me, I am very innocent.

14:07.431 --> 14:18.940
Innocence is
that which does not harm anyone, that does

14:18.940 --> 14:33.670
not think that it can solve the problems,
but, it leaves everything for God to solve.

14:33.670 --> 14:51.550
It is just existence itself-in the blessings
of your Mother, as Ganesha was, just living

14:51.550 --> 15:00.560
on the complete blessings of His Mother.

15:00.560 --> 15:06.420
It gives you concentration.

15:06.420 --> 15:17.300
Have you seen a child being nursed by mother,
how concentrated the child is.

15:17.300 --> 15:22.269
Sucking everything!

15:22.269 --> 15:41.670
It doesn’t bother who is who, where he is
sitting, what is it, what is catching.

15:41.670 --> 15:54.550
It doesn’t bother as to who is next to you,
what is your relationship with others.

15:54.550 --> 16:05.020
Or it doesn’t bother, at all, as to the
future, as

16:05.020 --> 16:12.209
to what he is to do next.

16:12.209 --> 16:17.829
So innocence keeps you in the present.

16:17.829 --> 16:19.660
Innocent man is permanently relaxed.

16:19.660 --> 16:23.820
Supposing I have to go today.

16:23.820 --> 16:35.329
Alright, so I’ll go at the time when I have
to go; what’s the use of getting agitated

16:35.329 --> 16:39.770
about it?

16:39.770 --> 16:42.600
People get even 10 days ahead agitated if
they have to go after ten days.

16:42.600 --> 16:54.230
And when it really comes to going, they have
forgotten everything.

16:54.230 --> 17:01.620
Because they are not in the present.

17:01.620 --> 17:06.120
So to develop your innocence also is a very
good idea ‘to be in the present’.

17:06.120 --> 17:11.720
At the most what’s going to happen?

17:11.720 --> 17:21.159
I mean whatever has to happen will happen
in any case.

17:21.159 --> 17:22.399
So why worry?

17:22.399 --> 17:31.179
I am one person who is least worried, and
nothing has gone wrong with me so far.

17:31.179 --> 17:49.940
On the contrary I play tricks that everything
goes wrong with people like that!

17:49.940 --> 18:01.799
And I want them to learn that this is not
so important.

18:01.799 --> 18:09.750
To keep yourself in the present is your job
and leave everything to God Because you don’t

18:09.750 --> 18:24.559
know that when you are in the present you
are in contact with the Divine power, but

18:24.559 --> 18:37.720
when you get out of the present you are not
there -you are under your ego or superego.

18:37.720 --> 18:47.440
So for all of you I may try just to show that
I am also playing with you to prepare you.

18:47.440 --> 18:54.109
I am least bothered about anything whatsoever.

18:54.109 --> 19:08.509
What is such a disaster you have seen in your
life, just tell me.

19:08.509 --> 19:15.289
I have seen the last dissolution of the whole
universe.

19:15.289 --> 19:21.929
What can I fear anymore?

19:21.929 --> 19:33.630
So when you get upset, think of something
very serious that has happened to you before,

19:33.630 --> 19:50.049
and then you will not be so much worried about
the non sensical little things here and there.

19:50.049 --> 19:56.649
So miraculous things will happen, through
your innocence.

19:56.649 --> 20:05.169
The more innocent you are the more blissful
you will be.

20:05.169 --> 20:13.290
Now, many people should try this thing: sitting
in a group together, meditating, saying the

20:13.290 --> 20:22.409
mantra of Shri Ganesha, to try to build up.

20:22.409 --> 20:38.359
Those who think too much, they should also
try to say “Not this, not this, not this

20:38.359 --> 20:39.359
… “.

20:39.359 --> 20:51.070
Even the superego when it gives you thoughts,
you should say “not this, not this, not

20:51.070 --> 20:52.070
this … “.

20:52.070 --> 21:04.999
So you will develop that state where you stand
yourself: and nothing else.

21:04.999 --> 21:20.489
So the innocence plays, but it is not involved.

21:20.489 --> 21:30.029
It sees the play.

21:30.029 --> 21:32.879
Just sees.

21:32.879 --> 21:39.749
It enjoys the play.

21:39.749 --> 21:41.970
Just enjoys.

21:41.970 --> 21:58.029
So today when we are thinking of Shri Ganesha,
let us desire that, “Within us His great

21:58.029 --> 22:02.529
power of innocence be enlightened”.

22:02.529 --> 22:17.529
And He is, on the other side, the source of
love.

22:17.529 --> 22:22.479
The source of emotional security.

22:22.479 --> 22:34.174
He’s like a child, a very charming, beautiful
child, and people feel extremely enchanted.

22:34.199 --> 22:55.463
Charmed, seeing that innocence?  You see it's a fraternal love, a fraternal enchantment for him.

22:55.488 --> 22:57.752
A motherly enchantment.

23:03.919 --> 23:07.080
Because ” charming” also is a very funny
word.

23:07.080 --> 23:25.269
Because in the west people don’t understand
even innocence towards children.

23:25.269 --> 23:36.210
So you have to be childlike, not childish,
confusion must not be there.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.139
But some people confuse it.

23:38.139 --> 23:50.989
They think it should be like a big baby, you
see; and that you have to be treated like

23:50.989 --> 23:55.840
a big baby all the time, from bottle feeding
to nappy changing, in Marathi it is called

23:55.840 --> 23:59.509
“Motha Bal”.

23:59.509 --> 24:10.529
And there’s no end to it.

24:10.529 --> 24:27.150
So this kind of thing, if it is done to someone,
that really will become a stupid fellow in

24:27.150 --> 24:30.289
no time.

24:30.289 --> 24:38.119
But Ganesha’s enchantment has dignity.

24:38.119 --> 24:49.263
He may look like a child, but He is an old
man.

24:49.263 --> 24:52.429
He is the eldest of all.

24:52.429 --> 25:03.249
And despite all these years, he has kept His
innocence intact.

25:03.249 --> 25:16.429
So sometimes people confuse it with over doting or sort of caring too much, and the innocent person

25:16.429 --> 25:27.879
doesn’t like it much.

25:27.879 --> 25:36.729
Even if somebody does it, He wouldn't mind,
because it pleases the other person.

25:36.729 --> 25:47.999
But it does not go to his head or anything.

25:47.999 --> 25:54.250
On the contrary, when you are doting on such
a person, you start learning.

25:54.250 --> 26:04.989
There was somebody like that he was an
expert on massaging the feet.

26:04.989 --> 26:16.489
So she said “Mother, just you give me one
hour one day and I will come and massage your

26:16.489 --> 26:23.119
Feet, because I have known that art”.

26:23.119 --> 26:30.700
I said alright, come such and such day.

26:30.700 --> 26:39.710
And when she started massaging my feet, you
see, she said, “What is happening!

26:39.710 --> 26:43.720
It is me who is relaxing”.

26:43.720 --> 26:53.429
So, that is the beauty of innocence, that
when you try to pamper the innocence, when

26:53.429 --> 27:10.450
you try to dote on the innocence, it emits
the beauty.

27:10.450 --> 27:11.450
It relaxes.

27:11.450 --> 27:17.159
If there is a little child, and you want to
kiss the child and you want to embrace the

27:17.159 --> 27:28.539
child and you want to love the child -it is
‘you’ who is wanting, not the child.

27:28.539 --> 27:39.460
If you do not want it, you are abnormal.

27:39.460 --> 27:47.179
But if you want to dote on some one, then
that should ‘relax’ that person, the one

27:47.179 --> 27:51.339
who does that.

27:51.339 --> 27:57.460
But if it is the other way round, that the
other person gets tensed up and the person

27:57.460 --> 28:03.789
whom you dote, gets becomes ego-oriented, then it
is all wrong, absolutely it is upside down.

28:03.789 --> 28:16.339
You get tensed up because you think nothing
should displease the person, you think the

28:16.339 --> 28:43.389
person needs it.

28:43.389 --> 28:54.330
You try to dote on the child thinking that
the child needs it.

28:54.330 --> 28:59.820
It is ‘you’ who need it.

28:59.820 --> 29:04.999
If you remember that, that ‘you’ need
it then why should you worry that you should

29:04.999 --> 29:18.330
not do this particular thing the person will
be displeased.

29:18.330 --> 29:26.249
So just by pleasing yourself you are really
pleasing the other person, one has to see

29:26.249 --> 29:28.359
it that way.

29:28.359 --> 29:34.509
So this is wisdom: To see things in right
perspective.

29:34.509 --> 29:42.679
And that is what should come into everyone
spontaneously.

29:42.679 --> 29:53.309
When that comes in, you become a complete
personality.

29:53.309 --> 30:03.049
Ganesha is sufficient to make
you complete, because He is complete.

30:03.049 --> 30:11.720
And as it is, for you people to do it, it
is easier, because you are already at a point

30:11.720 --> 30:23.489
where Ganesha is pleased.

30:23.489 --> 30:29.259
Or we can say that you are pleased with yourself.

30:29.259 --> 30:34.839
So one should not feel that, or should not
feel bad.

30:34.839 --> 30:43.279
If someone feels hurt or something, that means
there is something lacking in that person.

30:43.279 --> 30:59.529
Such a personality is the personality where
we can say that Shri Ganesha is residing with

30:59.529 --> 31:03.029
all His powers.

31:03.029 --> 31:13.229
But some people have the right Ganesha and
some people have the left Ganesha powers.

31:13.229 --> 31:22.609
Both the types of powers must be developed.

31:22.609 --> 31:29.639
If a man has been licentious and very fond
of the other sex and all that, he gets such

31:29.639 --> 31:49.330
a rebound that he be comes an ‘absolutely’
left-side character.

31:49.330 --> 31:54.410
Supposing before realisation he is running
after women, or the girl is running after the

31:54.410 --> 32:01.539
men, all that, gets such a rebound that, he
just doesn’t want to do that thing, as a

32:01.539 --> 32:22.830
filth, he thinks its filth, that is one of
the feelings that come in the mind of a person,

32:22.830 --> 32:41.879
when he doesn’t hanker after this kind of
nonsense.

32:41.879 --> 33:01.419
Like we have horrible names like heterosexuals
and homosexuals and all sexual sorts.

33:01.419 --> 33:27.639
When you keep a healthy company of your’
type, of your sex, healthy company healthy and pure.

33:27.639 --> 33:36.700
It is very natural.

33:36.700 --> 33:54.149
And the another extreme nature should
not be followed.

33:54.149 --> 34:00.989
Like, I have also seen among some muslims, this is a habit,
that they are more attached to their daughters

34:00.989 --> 34:02.549
than to their wives.

34:02.549 --> 34:03.940
Funny thing.

34:03.940 --> 34:07.759
It is absurd.

34:07.759 --> 34:13.750
They pay more importance to the daughters
than to the wife -it is something very absurd,

34:13.750 --> 34:15.530
it is not good.

34:15.530 --> 34:18.919
It’s again perversion.

34:18.919 --> 34:31.060
Or the women, they love their son more than
their husband.

34:31.060 --> 34:35.850
It is absurd.

34:35.850 --> 34:40.640
And once it starts working like that, it can
go to any absurd limit, which is not in the

34:40.640 --> 34:47.710
‘maryadas’ in the boundaries of Sahaja
Yoga.

34:47.710 --> 35:03.150
There has to be very healthy relationship.

35:03.150 --> 35:14.160
Friendship, but not attachment which looks
funny and absurd.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.069
So nothing absurd should be done.

35:16.069 --> 35:19.339
No thing overly should be done.

35:19.339 --> 35:31.460
Because there will be remorse and unnecessary
heart burning for nothing at all, it is useless.

35:31.460 --> 35:40.390
Now, in Sahaja Yoga another very important
point I have to tell you today, which is not

35:40.390 --> 35:45.060
so much besides Shri Ganesha’s point, which we always make mistakes.

35:45.060 --> 36:01.170
Then in India there have been lots of
Mistakes like that: Now I give you one example

36:01.170 --> 36:02.170
of Mr.

36:02.170 --> 36:13.299
X who is a great Sahaja Yogi, in the sense
that he is a great organiser he has done this,

36:13.299 --> 36:19.150
he has done that, and we start adoring him.

36:19.150 --> 36:22.400
Or we may be jealous.

36:22.400 --> 36:27.329
One of the two things happen, either we adore
or we are jealous.

36:27.329 --> 36:32.400
Now, if you adore that person, then you must
follow his footsteps.

36:32.400 --> 36:44.789
And if you are jealous, then it is more reason
that you follow his footsteps so you become

36:44.789 --> 36:46.250
like him.

36:46.250 --> 36:52.329
I am talking of wisdom.

36:52.329 --> 37:04.069
Now, but instead of that when you adore -even
whether you are a boy or a girl, you will

37:04.069 --> 37:18.590
jump on him, you will hug him and kiss him,
you do all kinds of non sensical things.

37:18.590 --> 37:21.790
Which is ‘not needed’ to express that
way.

37:21.790 --> 37:26.609
Like it happened with me that I was in London
for the first time.

37:26.609 --> 37:37.829
I’d never known all this, and somebody who
was quite hefty just came and hugged me, and

37:37.829 --> 37:54.190
I didn’t know what was the word in this
language.

37:54.190 --> 38:06.900
So I told him in marathi “Put me down”.

38:06.900 --> 38:13.600
So it is quite funny.

38:13.600 --> 38:27.000
I am not used to kissing at all, ‘at all’.

38:27.000 --> 38:35.780
Anybody kisses me, I get a fright you know.

38:35.780 --> 38:46.769
I can kiss a lady or a little boy that is
all right, that is done, but not every man,

38:46.769 --> 38:54.440
I cannot kiss -it’s very funny, isn’t
it?

38:54.440 --> 39:00.869
So this kind of adoration is not very wise.

39:00.869 --> 39:07.260
Adoration is to be felt in your heart.

39:07.260 --> 39:12.670
Like yesterday one of the gentlemen put his
hand so strong on me, that for two minutes

39:12.670 --> 39:19.270
I was just trying to put it right.

39:19.270 --> 39:27.490
And this shaking hands is a very horrible
thing.

39:27.490 --> 39:31.049
Sometimes they cannot feel alright unless
and until they have taken about a kilo of

39:31.049 --> 39:32.049
Meat out.

39:32.049 --> 39:45.990
…And this is how sometimes, there are no
maryadas’ left, even among ourselves.

39:45.990 --> 39:56.550
So there should be maryadas.

39:56.550 --> 40:10.609
Now feeling jealousy is another thing.

40:10.609 --> 40:22.670
I have seen that when people feel jealous,
they start coming and complaining against

40:22.670 --> 40:34.109
this person or that person -I know it is.

40:34.109 --> 40:36.390
Jealousy is the worst curse ever we can have,
I think, because then you can’t see anything

40:36.390 --> 40:37.390
that is good.

40:37.390 --> 40:44.700
Because you see a person is normal, you feel
jealous of such a person.

40:44.700 --> 40:58.750
Then you feel, you are jealous so you have
every right to do what you like.

40:58.750 --> 41:04.859
You just say,” I am jealous of you, because
you are so good.

41:04.859 --> 41:16.079
So, now I can be very bad.

41:16.079 --> 41:20.109
I mean at first it started with people telling
that this is jealousy which is a bad thing;

41:20.109 --> 41:21.109
it was all right.

41:21.109 --> 41:28.480
But now the bad thing is taken as blackmail,
you see, you use it.

41:28.480 --> 41:32.500
for blackmailing others, that, “Oh, alright!

41:32.500 --> 41:35.259
I am a bad man, so I am a bad man.

41:35.259 --> 41:43.539
You are a good man, alright, So what?”

41:43.539 --> 41:47.140
Just like that.

41:47.140 --> 41:53.500
To use it as a power.

41:53.500 --> 41:56.039
Like yesterday one madman came, a lunatic.

41:56.039 --> 42:04.420
Now when this lunatic came, he wanted to sit
in the front.

42:04.420 --> 42:16.460
And he just started taking advantage of his
lunacy!

42:16.460 --> 42:17.619
That if he is a lunatic, he can behave the
way he likes.

42:17.619 --> 42:22.830
Because you are a drunkard you can behave
the way you like.

42:22.830 --> 42:24.910
Now, what is the wisdom?

42:24.910 --> 42:28.940
Where is it lost?

42:28.940 --> 42:31.960
It is ridiculous.

42:31.960 --> 42:38.010
So, one has to be wise.

42:38.010 --> 42:44.660
When you are dealing with it, the wisdom is
your glory.

42:44.660 --> 42:55.810
By wisdom you will be fair to yourself and
fair to others.

42:55.810 --> 43:02.230
Wisdom is like an ocean, one can not describe
it

43:02.230 --> 43:07.130
in one lecture.

43:07.130 --> 43:16.930
Just try to enjoy your wisdom.

43:16.930 --> 43:20.740
And the greatest wisdom of Shri Ganesha was
that he was surrendered to his Mother, that

43:20.740 --> 43:22.180
is all; he is not bothered.

43:22.180 --> 43:35.319
And when you
are surrendered then you just understand that

43:35.319 --> 43:48.230
you give up your ego and superego to
your Mother to bother about it, and you live

43:48.230 --> 43:55.190
with your innocence.

43:55.190 --> 44:04.690
And to understand also in a very gross way,
we can say, to have Ganesha tattva (Principle)

44:04.690 --> 44:13.220
developed in you, you must eat things which
are emitting Ganesha Principle.

44:13.220 --> 44:15.619
Like the Chana, like, I have found out, the
Hazelnut.

44:15.619 --> 44:26.650
Then you can see that you should use a lot
of these lemons, is a good idea.

44:26.650 --> 44:38.720
All these give you a good Ganesha Tattva.

44:38.720 --> 44:56.140
So all these things should be used, and there
are many other things one can see that, which

44:56.140 --> 44:58.740
help you to develop your Ganesha Tattva.

44:58.740 --> 45:07.930
But the highest of all is to control your
eyes.

45:07.930 --> 45:16.170
Not to see anything that is tempting.

45:16.170 --> 45:21.869
So put your eyes on the ground.

45:21.869 --> 45:35.779
Just watch your eyes when another sex arrives,
how do you look at that person, with greed,

45:35.779 --> 45:41.609
with lust.

45:41.609 --> 45:56.039
And if you understand that then you will start
clearing your eyes very well.

45:56.039 --> 46:03.559
Another thing is physically you should try
to do one or two exercises to be able to put

46:03.559 --> 46:14.880
yourself flat on the Mother Earth, because
that helps.

46:14.880 --> 46:23.829
So before doing the meditation to Shri Ganesha,
you must first do that exercise, to loosen

46:23.829 --> 46:39.180
the muscles so that you should touch the Mother
Earth in a more flat way.

46:39.180 --> 46:45.319
It will help.

46:45.319 --> 46:56.220
So for today I think I have said sufficiently.

46:56.220 --> 46:57.230
May God bless you.
