00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:36.520
Today we are celebrating the Birthday of Shri
Ganesha, because it is a very important thing

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.060
for all of us that we should celebrate His
Birthday; and yesterday we did the Havana.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:55.360
But yesterday we had many new people so I
could not talk to you very clearly about Shri

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.580
Ganesha’s deeper manifestations.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:14.140
You know that He resides within us.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:44.350
We have a very great asset within us that
we know about Shri Ganesha, and that we can

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.750
excite His powers.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:13.190
To manifest Shri Ganesha, we have to do certain
amount of Tapasya, Penance.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:49.360
First we have to say, when we sit for meditation,
that, “I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:04:06.099
Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by
You, and my only desire is to please You”.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:18.470
Then you sit down in complete preparedness,
meditating over your Mooladhara, putting your

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.180
attention to it with absolute purity.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:41.300
Now you have my photograph before you and
you tell the photograph that, “Mother, You are

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:51.150
Shri Ganesha.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.060
You give me wisdom and discretion”.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:08.590
So, attention at the mooladhara chakra, which
is actually below the sacrum bone.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:22.840
You put your right hand towards the photograph,
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:50.350
Now this will tell you that your mind, or
your brain which is full of confusion, which

00:05:50.350 --> 00:06:05.070
has no discretion, which is complicated, which
does the same mistakes again and again, which

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:38.900
does not understand how to cure the ills of
bad feelings, all that can be cured if you

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:51.120
put your right hand towards me and the left
hand towards the Mother Earth.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.169
So, in action you do like that.

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:06.389
Now as He is the ‘essence’ of everything’
that is material, that has bhava , that has

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:08.620
been created.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:17.310
He is the essence of everything that has been
created.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.680
‘Through Him’ everything has been created.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:37.810
When you develop that, you develop your sense
of subtle creativity, and the sense of subtle

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:44.580
appreciation of creativity.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:08:01.979
Then you develop your discretion of how to
behave with others, in a beautiful manner,

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:06.660
so that your ego is controlled.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:18.870
The behaviour should be such that there should
be no expression of ego in your behaviour.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.199
Your Mother is a good example.

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:39.930
I think you know that I know quite a lot of
things, but I never show off, nor ever assert

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:45.370
that I am so knowledgeable.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:09:01.380
1 live like a very very ordinary person with
you, and I do not in any way assert my personality

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:07.270
that gives you a shock.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:18.791
So, with your intelligence or with your other
powers -like if you are a moneyed man or if

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:33.480
you are more efficient, or anything, you should
not try to impress on others.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:45.620
But you must deal with it beautifully.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:52.790
So the beauty comes when you are efficient
“and” you are loving.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:59.490
That is the central point, that is the result.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:10.170
That you are knowledgeable and you are humble.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:19.130
That you know everything about everyone but
you are discreet.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:43.399
So in effect it is a complete personality
that can only give that kind of a very soothing

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:46.769
effect.

00:10:46.769 --> 00:11:00.399
So the soothing effect comes as a result of
beauty.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:08.970
So to develop it you have to meditate on your
mooladhara chakra.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:18.910
I have seen many people get fanatic about
Sahaja Yoga also.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.730
They think they are the real Napoleons or
Shivaji!

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:35.700
In Marathi we call him Shivaji, but Shivaji
was a much better person than Napoleon, better

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.029
to call him Napoleon.

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:49.860
Then they start guiding you in everything
-“This is not good, that is not good.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.570
Tam a very great Sahaja Yogi!

00:11:51.570 --> 00:12:04.730
You are like this,” and all that, and very
hot tempered because they are fanatics.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.029
Fanaticism and temper goes together.

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:12.060
There is no love in fanaticism.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:23.360
If you tell them don’t be a fanatic, they
will start crying.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:30.332
So the fanaticism of Sahaja Yoga is most blinding.

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:35.840
It is something like, in front of the Temple
of God you beg from other people for money.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:53.550
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which should not
lead you to ‘any’ fanaticism.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:13:06.940
You have to be prasanna-chitta, which means
you should be a very happy, joyous personality;

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:14.440
and not a tense, abrupt person.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:30.120
But this only achieves it’s maximum result
when everything is done in complete innocence.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.600
But many people confuse innocence with stupidity.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.149
They think, to be stupid is innocent.

00:13:40.149 --> 00:13:49.010
And a stupid man gets into an ego trip in
no time.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:54.269
Innocence is the wisest thing.

00:13:54.269 --> 00:14:00.339
You ‘cannot’ befool innocence, that’s
the main thing.

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:07.431
No one can befool me, I am very innocent.

00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:18.940
Innocence is
that which does not harm anyone, that does

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:33.670
not think that it can solve the problems,
but, it leaves everything for God to solve.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:51.550
It is just existence itself-in the blessings
of your Mother, as Ganesha was, just living

00:14:51.550 --> 00:15:00.560
on the complete blessings of His Mother.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.420
It gives you concentration.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:17.300
Have you seen a child being nursed by mother,
how concentrated the child is.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.269
Sucking everything!

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:41.670
It doesn’t bother who is who, where he is
sitting, what is it, what is catching.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:54.550
It doesn’t bother as to who is next to you,
what is your relationship with others.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:05.020
Or it doesn’t bother, at all, as to the
future, as

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:12.209
to what he is to do next.

00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:17.829
So innocence keeps you in the present.

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:19.660
Innocent man is permanently relaxed.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.820
Supposing I have to go today.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:35.329
Alright, so I’ll go at the time when I have
to go; what’s the use of getting agitated

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:39.770
about it?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.600
People get even 10 days ahead agitated if
they have to go after ten days.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:54.230
And when it really comes to going, they have
forgotten everything.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:01.620
Because they are not in the present.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.120
So to develop your innocence also is a very
good idea ‘to be in the present’.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.720
At the most what’s going to happen?

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:21.159
I mean whatever has to happen will happen
in any case.

00:17:21.159 --> 00:17:22.399
So why worry?

00:17:22.399 --> 00:17:31.179
I am one person who is least worried, and
nothing has gone wrong with me so far.

00:17:31.179 --> 00:17:49.940
On the contrary I play tricks that everything
goes wrong with people like that!

00:17:49.940 --> 00:18:01.799
And I want them to learn that this is not
so important.

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:09.750
To keep yourself in the present is your job
and leave everything to God Because you don’t

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:24.559
know that when you are in the present you
are in contact with the Divine power, but

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:37.720
when you get out of the present you are not
there -you are under your ego or superego.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:47.440
So for all of you I may try just to show that
I am also playing with you to prepare you.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:54.109
I am least bothered about anything whatsoever.

00:18:54.109 --> 00:19:08.509
What is such a disaster you have seen in your
life, just tell me.

00:19:08.509 --> 00:19:15.289
I have seen the last dissolution of the whole
universe.

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:21.929
What can I fear anymore?

00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:33.630
So when you get upset, think of something
very serious that has happened to you before,

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:50.049
and then you will not be so much worried about
the non sensical little things here and there.

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:56.649
So miraculous things will happen, through
your innocence.

00:19:56.649 --> 00:20:05.169
The more innocent you are the more blissful
you will be.

00:20:05.169 --> 00:20:13.290
Now, many people should try this thing: sitting
in a group together, meditating, saying the

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:22.409
mantra of Shri Ganesha, to try to build up.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:38.359
Those who think too much, they should also
try to say “Not this, not this, not this

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:39.359
… “.

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:51.070
Even the superego when it gives you thoughts,
you should say “not this, not this, not

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.070
this … “.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:21:04.999
So you will develop that state where you stand
yourself: and nothing else.

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:20.489
So the innocence plays, but it is not involved.

00:21:20.489 --> 00:21:30.029
It sees the play.

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:32.879
Just sees.

00:21:32.879 --> 00:21:39.749
It enjoys the play.

00:21:39.749 --> 00:21:41.970
Just enjoys.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:58.029
So today when we are thinking of Shri Ganesha,
let us desire that, “Within us His great

00:21:58.029 --> 00:22:02.529
power of innocence be enlightened”.

00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:17.529
And He is, on the other side, the source of
love.

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:22.479
The source of emotional security.

00:22:22.479 --> 00:22:34.174
He’s like a child, a very charming, beautiful
child, and people feel extremely enchanted.

00:22:34.199 --> 00:22:55.463
Charmed, seeing that innocence?  You see it's a fraternal love, a fraternal enchantment for him.

00:22:55.488 --> 00:22:57.752
A motherly enchantment.

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.080
Because ” charming” also is a very funny
word.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:25.269
Because in the west people don’t understand
even innocence towards children.

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:36.210
So you have to be childlike, not childish,
confusion must not be there.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.139
But some people confuse it.

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:50.989
They think it should be like a big baby, you
see; and that you have to be treated like

00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:55.840
a big baby all the time, from bottle feeding
to nappy changing, in Marathi it is called

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.509
“Motha Bal”.

00:23:59.509 --> 00:24:10.529
And there’s no end to it.

00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:27.150
So this kind of thing, if it is done to someone,
that really will become a stupid fellow in

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.289
no time.

00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:38.119
But Ganesha’s enchantment has dignity.

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:49.263
He may look like a child, but He is an old
man.

00:24:49.263 --> 00:24:52.429
He is the eldest of all.

00:24:52.429 --> 00:25:03.249
And despite all these years, he has kept His
innocence intact.

00:25:03.249 --> 00:25:16.429
So sometimes people confuse it with over doting or sort of caring too much, and the innocent person

00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:27.879
doesn’t like it much.

00:25:27.879 --> 00:25:36.729
Even if somebody does it, He wouldn't mind,
because it pleases the other person.

00:25:36.729 --> 00:25:47.999
But it does not go to his head or anything.

00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:54.250
On the contrary, when you are doting on such
a person, you start learning.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:26:04.989
There was somebody like that he was an
expert on massaging the feet.

00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:16.489
So she said “Mother, just you give me one
hour one day and I will come and massage your

00:26:16.489 --> 00:26:23.119
Feet, because I have known that art”.

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:30.700
I said alright, come such and such day.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:39.710
And when she started massaging my feet, you
see, she said, “What is happening!

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.720
It is me who is relaxing”.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:53.429
So, that is the beauty of innocence, that
when you try to pamper the innocence, when

00:26:53.429 --> 00:27:10.450
you try to dote on the innocence, it emits
the beauty.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.450
It relaxes.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:17.159
If there is a little child, and you want to
kiss the child and you want to embrace the

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:28.539
child and you want to love the child -it is
‘you’ who is wanting, not the child.

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:39.460
If you do not want it, you are abnormal.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:47.179
But if you want to dote on some one, then
that should ‘relax’ that person, the one

00:27:47.179 --> 00:27:51.339
who does that.

00:27:51.339 --> 00:27:57.460
But if it is the other way round, that the
other person gets tensed up and the person

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:03.789
whom you dote, gets becomes ego-oriented, then it
is all wrong, absolutely it is upside down.

00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:16.339
You get tensed up because you think nothing
should displease the person, you think the

00:28:16.339 --> 00:28:43.389
person needs it.

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:54.330
You try to dote on the child thinking that
the child needs it.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:59.820
It is ‘you’ who need it.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.999
If you remember that, that ‘you’ need
it then why should you worry that you should

00:29:04.999 --> 00:29:18.330
not do this particular thing the person will
be displeased.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:26.249
So just by pleasing yourself you are really
pleasing the other person, one has to see

00:29:26.249 --> 00:29:28.359
it that way.

00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:34.509
So this is wisdom: To see things in right
perspective.

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:42.679
And that is what should come into everyone
spontaneously.

00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:53.309
When that comes in, you become a complete
personality.

00:29:53.309 --> 00:30:03.049
Ganesha is sufficient to make
you complete, because He is complete.

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:11.720
And as it is, for you people to do it, it
is easier, because you are already at a point

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:23.489
where Ganesha is pleased.

00:30:23.489 --> 00:30:29.259
Or we can say that you are pleased with yourself.

00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:34.839
So one should not feel that, or should not
feel bad.

00:30:34.839 --> 00:30:43.279
If someone feels hurt or something, that means
there is something lacking in that person.

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:59.529
Such a personality is the personality where
we can say that Shri Ganesha is residing with

00:30:59.529 --> 00:31:03.029
all His powers.

00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:13.229
But some people have the right Ganesha and
some people have the left Ganesha powers.

00:31:13.229 --> 00:31:22.609
Both the types of powers must be developed.

00:31:22.609 --> 00:31:29.639
If a man has been licentious and very fond
of the other sex and all that, he gets such

00:31:29.639 --> 00:31:49.330
a rebound that he be comes an ‘absolutely’
left-side character.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:54.410
Supposing before realisation he is running
after women, or the girl is running after the

00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:01.539
men, all that, gets such a rebound that, he
just doesn’t want to do that thing, as a

00:32:01.539 --> 00:32:22.830
filth, he thinks its filth, that is one of
the feelings that come in the mind of a person,

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:41.879
when he doesn’t hanker after this kind of
nonsense.

00:32:41.879 --> 00:33:01.419
Like we have horrible names like heterosexuals
and homosexuals and all sexual sorts.

00:33:01.419 --> 00:33:27.639
When you keep a healthy company of your’
type, of your sex, healthy company healthy and pure.

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:36.700
It is very natural.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:54.149
And the another extreme nature should
not be followed.

00:33:54.149 --> 00:34:00.989
Like, I have also seen among some muslims, this is a habit,
that they are more attached to their daughters

00:34:00.989 --> 00:34:02.549
than to their wives.

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:03.940
Funny thing.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.759
It is absurd.

00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:13.750
They pay more importance to the daughters
than to the wife -it is something very absurd,

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.530
it is not good.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.919
It’s again perversion.

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:31.060
Or the women, they love their son more than
their husband.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.850
It is absurd.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:40.640
And once it starts working like that, it can
go to any absurd limit, which is not in the

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:47.710
‘maryadas’ in the boundaries of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:35:03.150
There has to be very healthy relationship.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:14.160
Friendship, but not attachment which looks
funny and absurd.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.069
So nothing absurd should be done.

00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:19.339
No thing overly should be done.

00:35:19.339 --> 00:35:31.460
Because there will be remorse and unnecessary
heart burning for nothing at all, it is useless.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:40.390
Now, in Sahaja Yoga another very important
point I have to tell you today, which is not

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:45.060
so much besides Shri Ganesha’s point, which we always make mistakes.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:36:01.170
Then in India there have been lots of
Mistakes like that: Now I give you one example

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.170
of Mr.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:13.299
X who is a great Sahaja Yogi, in the sense
that he is a great organiser he has done this,

00:36:13.299 --> 00:36:19.150
he has done that, and we start adoring him.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.400
Or we may be jealous.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.329
One of the two things happen, either we adore
or we are jealous.

00:36:27.329 --> 00:36:32.400
Now, if you adore that person, then you must
follow his footsteps.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:44.789
And if you are jealous, then it is more reason
that you follow his footsteps so you become

00:36:44.789 --> 00:36:46.250
like him.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:52.329
I am talking of wisdom.

00:36:52.329 --> 00:37:04.069
Now, but instead of that when you adore -even
whether you are a boy or a girl, you will

00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:18.590
jump on him, you will hug him and kiss him,
you do all kinds of non sensical things.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.790
Which is ‘not needed’ to express that
way.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:26.609
Like it happened with me that I was in London
for the first time.

00:37:26.609 --> 00:37:37.829
I’d never known all this, and somebody who
was quite hefty just came and hugged me, and

00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:54.190
I didn’t know what was the word in this
language.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:38:06.900
So I told him in marathi “Put me down”.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:13.600
So it is quite funny.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:27.000
I am not used to kissing at all, ‘at all’.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:35.780
Anybody kisses me, I get a fright you know.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:46.769
I can kiss a lady or a little boy that is
all right, that is done, but not every man,

00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:54.440
I cannot kiss -it’s very funny, isn’t
it?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:00.869
So this kind of adoration is not very wise.

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:07.260
Adoration is to be felt in your heart.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.670
Like yesterday one of the gentlemen put his
hand so strong on me, that for two minutes

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:19.270
I was just trying to put it right.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:27.490
And this shaking hands is a very horrible
thing.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:31.049
Sometimes they cannot feel alright unless
and until they have taken about a kilo of

00:39:31.049 --> 00:39:32.049
Meat out.

00:39:32.049 --> 00:39:45.990
…And this is how sometimes, there are no
maryadas’ left, even among ourselves.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:56.550
So there should be maryadas.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:10.609
Now feeling jealousy is another thing.

00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:22.670
I have seen that when people feel jealous,
they start coming and complaining against

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:34.109
this person or that person -I know it is.

00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:36.390
Jealousy is the worst curse ever we can have,
I think, because then you can’t see anything

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.390
that is good.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:44.700
Because you see a person is normal, you feel
jealous of such a person.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:58.750
Then you feel, you are jealous so you have
every right to do what you like.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:04.859
You just say,” I am jealous of you, because
you are so good.

00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:16.079
So, now I can be very bad.

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:20.109
I mean at first it started with people telling
that this is jealousy which is a bad thing;

00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:21.109
it was all right.

00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:28.480
But now the bad thing is taken as blackmail,
you see, you use it.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.500
for blackmailing others, that, “Oh, alright!

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.259
I am a bad man, so I am a bad man.

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:43.539
You are a good man, alright, So what?”

00:41:43.539 --> 00:41:47.140
Just like that.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:53.500
To use it as a power.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.039
Like yesterday one madman came, a lunatic.

00:41:56.039 --> 00:42:04.420
Now when this lunatic came, he wanted to sit
in the front.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:16.460
And he just started taking advantage of his
lunacy!

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.619
That if he is a lunatic, he can behave the
way he likes.

00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:22.830
Because you are a drunkard you can behave
the way you like.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.910
Now, what is the wisdom?

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.940
Where is it lost?

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.960
It is ridiculous.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:38.010
So, one has to be wise.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:44.660
When you are dealing with it, the wisdom is
your glory.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:55.810
By wisdom you will be fair to yourself and
fair to others.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:43:02.230
Wisdom is like an ocean, one can not describe
it

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:07.130
in one lecture.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:16.930
Just try to enjoy your wisdom.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:20.740
And the greatest wisdom of Shri Ganesha was
that he was surrendered to his Mother, that

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.180
is all; he is not bothered.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:35.319
And when you
are surrendered then you just understand that

00:43:35.319 --> 00:43:48.230
you give up your ego and superego to
your Mother to bother about it, and you live

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:55.190
with your innocence.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:44:04.690
And to understand also in a very gross way,
we can say, to have Ganesha tattva (Principle)

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:13.220
developed in you, you must eat things which
are emitting Ganesha Principle.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.619
Like the Chana, like, I have found out, the
Hazelnut.

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:26.650
Then you can see that you should use a lot
of these lemons, is a good idea.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:38.720
All these give you a good Ganesha Tattva.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:56.140
So all these things should be used, and there
are many other things one can see that, which

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.740
help you to develop your Ganesha Tattva.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:07.930
But the highest of all is to control your
eyes.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:16.170
Not to see anything that is tempting.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:21.869
So put your eyes on the ground.

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:35.779
Just watch your eyes when another sex arrives,
how do you look at that person, with greed,

00:45:35.779 --> 00:45:41.609
with lust.

00:45:41.609 --> 00:45:56.039
And if you understand that then you will start
clearing your eyes very well.

00:45:56.039 --> 00:46:03.559
Another thing is physically you should try
to do one or two exercises to be able to put

00:46:03.559 --> 00:46:14.880
yourself flat on the Mother Earth, because
that helps.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:23.829
So before doing the meditation to Shri Ganesha,
you must first do that exercise, to loosen

00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:39.180
the muscles so that you should touch the Mother
Earth in a more flat way.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:45.319
It will help.

00:46:45.319 --> 00:46:56.220
So for today I think I have said sufficiently.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.230
May God bless you.
