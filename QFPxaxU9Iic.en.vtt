00:19.550 --> 00:26.208
So today is a day according to Indian calendar

00:26.409 --> 00:32.330
called as Parivartani Ekaadashi.

00:32.531 --> 00:36.770
Now, today’s the eleventh day of the moon,

00:36.971 --> 00:41.536
eleventh day is Ekaadashi.

00:41.737 --> 00:45.974
Also, in Sahaj Yoga you know about Ekaadasha Rudra

00:46.175 --> 00:53.716
which is here, which will ultimately destroy all those things

00:53.917 --> 00:56.560
which are not required anymore.

00:56.761 --> 01:01.925
That is Ekaadasha here that is the eleventh,

01:03.206 --> 01:07.188
but today is a special day where we are going to use

01:07.389 --> 01:10.961
the power of Ekaadasha

01:11.162 --> 01:15.500
to do the parivartan which means the transformation.

01:15.701 --> 01:19.250
It is not for destruction but for transformation.

01:19.451 --> 01:22.461
Is such a day to be here in New York

01:22.662 --> 01:25.866
where we use the destructive powers

01:26.067 --> 01:29.569
for the transformation of human beings.

01:29.770 --> 01:32.389
So, it’s a very great day today

01:32.590 --> 01:40.549
that we are going to transform people

01:40.750 --> 01:45.855
by the manifestation of the Ekaadasha’s powers.

01:46.056 --> 01:52.738
And they are eleven placed over your forehead here

01:52.939 --> 01:56.863
and you know how they work out.

01:57.064 --> 02:08.181
So, these ten come out of destructive powers of the Void.

02:08.697 --> 02:13.512
Void has got ten destructive powers also,

02:13.713 --> 02:20.684
out of those ten the destructive part settles down here.

02:20.885 --> 02:23.661
So when a person is on his destruction

02:23.862 --> 02:27.317
say for example a cancer is setting

02:27.518 --> 02:34.606
then you might feel a throb here at the apex of your Void.

02:34.807 --> 02:37.387
The throb.

02:37.588 --> 02:39.349
And, it doesn’t logically means

02:39.550 --> 02:41.247
that if there’s a throb set in there’s a cancer,

02:41.448 --> 02:44.661
but if there’s a cancer there will be a throbbing here going on.

02:44.862 --> 02:50.880
That means the force of life is trying to push it

02:51.081 --> 02:57.919
but the obstruction there starts accumulating on both the sides

02:58.120 --> 03:05.763
and in the center is the center of Vishuddhi of the Virat

03:05.964 --> 03:12.256
where Shri Krishna has become the Virat the Great Primordial Being.

03:12.457 --> 03:17.139
So, this is the eleventh power of destruction.

03:17.340 --> 03:20.037
He has a power called samhaara shakti

03:20.238 --> 03:23.394
by which he kills people

03:23.595 --> 03:29.031
so before killing them and finishing them off in the compassion of your Mother

03:29.232 --> 03:32.437
we have to first try to transform them.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.335
If they cannot be transformed then it’s alright

03:35.536 --> 03:37.874
then let Ekaadasha take over.

03:38.075 --> 03:44.554
So, their eleven destructive powers will be used by the Kalaki

03:44.755 --> 03:49.702
the one who is going to manifest on a white horse.

03:49.903 --> 03:52.694
Before that today is a very great day

03:52.895 --> 03:59.293
that these powers you are going to use for transformation.

03:59.770 --> 04:06.777
Now how can destructive powers be used for transformation?

04:07.558 --> 04:11.298
First of all when people know

04:11.499 --> 04:16.032
that there are destructive powers manifesting,

04:16.233 --> 04:19.610
they start fearing,

04:19.811 --> 04:25.844
they get afraid that we’ll be destroyed

04:26.045 --> 04:29.774
so we must take to God that’s one of the ways.

04:29.975 --> 04:33.844
Secondly, if a person comes to know about

04:34.045 --> 04:38.383
any destructive disease like cancer

04:38.584 --> 04:41.586
he wants to find out a method.

04:41.787 --> 04:46.328
And there is no method available on a human level.

04:46.529 --> 04:52.601
So then he thinks of God. And wants to come nearer to God.

04:52.802 --> 04:55.984
The fear brings him closer to God.

04:56.185 --> 04:59.570
He depends on God more then on his rationality,

04:59.771 --> 05:04.406
then on his ego or superego, and he wants to depend on

05:04.607 --> 05:12.358
God’s powers to cure him or to save him from his destruction.

05:12.559 --> 05:14.837
Because he’s now on the brink of destruction,

05:15.038 --> 05:18.407
as soon as cancer is set in he knows that

05:18.608 --> 05:24.568
there’s no end to it and he has to be destroyed.

05:25.421 --> 05:31.040
So, this is another way we people take to transformation,

05:31.241 --> 05:35.079
change their attitudes, change their value systems.

05:35.280 --> 05:42.602
I’ve known of many husbands or wives who got cancer

05:42.803 --> 05:45.343
and their counterparts

05:45.544 --> 05:51.476
became very mild, gentle, kindly, romantic people.

05:51.677 --> 05:58.726
They try to give all the love, all the protection,

05:58.927 --> 06:04.023
all the good things to a person who is going to die now of Ekaadasha.

06:04.224 --> 06:10.765
So a kind of a transforming temperament starts coming in a man

06:10.966 --> 06:15.945
that he sees that the person with whom he has lived all his life

06:16.146 --> 06:18.968
is now going to be no more

06:19.169 --> 06:23.898
so a kind of beautiful feelings towards the person

06:24.099 --> 06:29.117
of giving whatever you have beautiful within you starts

06:29.318 --> 06:34.422
and that’s how people develop another kind of personality

06:34.623 --> 06:37.586
which was never apparent before.

06:37.787 --> 06:44.930
So all the harshness and the aggressiveness drops out

06:45.131 --> 06:50.357
and all the sweetness starts pouring in.

06:52.490 --> 06:55.562
So the compassion in a man is a big thing,

06:55.763 --> 06:59.945
by which she gets transformed, many people who have lost

07:00.146 --> 07:02.742
their relations kith and kin

07:02.943 --> 07:09.281
become much more gentle kindly people,

07:09.482 --> 07:13.203
because Ekaadasha has expressed its awe.

07:13.404 --> 07:17.805
And also another kind of a fear comes into the minds of the people

07:18.006 --> 07:21.266
that tomorrow this can happen to me also.

07:21.467 --> 07:24.860
So I must do something about it.

07:25.061 --> 07:28.915
So at this time Sahaj Yoga helps them a lot.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.478
They come to Sahaj Yoga because such an emergency

07:32.679 --> 07:34.220
is created within themselves

07:34.421 --> 07:40.454
and they are rushed for their transformation to Sahaj Yoga.

07:40.655 --> 07:45.618
But, there’s another subtler way this destructive force helps

07:45.819 --> 07:51.345
by destroying all that is negative within us.

07:51.546 --> 07:57.509
Because unless and until that negative is destroyed within us,

07:57.710 --> 08:04.173
we cannot become people who can enter into the Kingdom of God.

08:04.374 --> 08:06.634
We have our ego, we have our superego,

08:06.835 --> 08:10.064
and both can be represented here.

08:10.265 --> 08:13.970
When you have your ego very much great ego

08:14.171 --> 08:18.001
then you’ll find a big blob-like ego coming out on this side,

08:18.202 --> 08:21.392
a very big one here. Or if you have a superego

08:21.593 --> 08:26.142
you can see another big thing jutting out on the brain here.

08:26.343 --> 08:28.767
So on both the sides you may get both the things

08:28.968 --> 08:32.876
if both the sympathetic are overactive.

08:33.077 --> 08:36.087
If you are not a very collective person

08:36.288 --> 08:38.196
also you might get a blob here

08:38.397 --> 08:41.587
so you might get all the thing filled up with your ego,

08:41.788 --> 08:51.541
superego and this Virata’s center again, blown up,

08:51.742 --> 08:57.369
in a way that a person develops a face

08:57.570 --> 08:59.221
like a monster sometimes,

08:59.422 --> 09:02.362
this portion becomes too big thick jutting out,

09:02.563 --> 09:04.893
there’s a character I’ve seen like that

09:05.094 --> 09:08.229
I think it is Frankenstein or someone.

09:08.430 --> 09:11.127
Is it?

09:11.328 --> 09:13.104
Frankenstein.

09:13.305 --> 09:16.706
Yes, that has come from the unconscious, Frankenstein character,

09:16.907 --> 09:21.034
is all this swollen up, jutting out and this face like that.

09:21.235 --> 09:25.690
That’s really the one that happens to human beings

09:25.891 --> 09:31.601
when he becomes a devil himself.

09:33.988 --> 09:37.373
So this is how the Ekaadasha works within us

09:37.574 --> 09:41.639
to destroy our negativity within us.

09:41.840 --> 09:49.622
In India so many people fast on this day, for atonement,

09:49.823 --> 09:53.122
on eleventh day is very common you must do Ekadashi

09:53.323 --> 09:56.528
all the Hindus and all these people do Ekadashi

09:56.729 --> 09:59.848
that is the eleventh day they don’t eat anything at all.

10:00.049 --> 10:03.411
But you shouldn’t do it after the advent of your Mother.

10:03.612 --> 10:06.044
Because I’m the Ekaadasha Myself,

10:06.245 --> 10:08.208
so why should you do it now when I’ve come,

10:08.409 --> 10:10.466
it was done when I was not here just to call Me

10:10.667 --> 10:13.708
so now I’m back here so you need not do this anymore

10:13.909 --> 10:18.185
the penance of Ekaadasha. But you have to be careful.

10:18.386 --> 10:23.310
Now Ekaadasha comes as I told you from the Void.

10:23.511 --> 10:31.685
So, firstly it comes when you accept someone as your guru.

10:31.886 --> 10:38.599
Say who are false, who are anti-God, anti-Christ,

10:38.800 --> 10:42.747
so you develop a kind of a thickness on this side

10:42.948 --> 10:48.286
when it is the person whom you are worshipping as a guru

10:48.487 --> 10:51.880
or are respecting as a guru, is a guru to you

10:52.081 --> 10:57.482
who is not really a guru so you develop a superego

10:57.683 --> 11:00.498
which shows on this side this part.

11:00.699 --> 11:03.732
Now the other side of it shows when a person says,

11:03.933 --> 11:08.857
“I’m my own guru, I’m practicing my own meditation,

11:09.058 --> 11:11.521
I’ve nothing to do with anybody’s guidance,

11:11.722 --> 11:14.029
I’m quite alright as I am,”

11:14.230 --> 11:15.920
such a person develops the other half,

11:16.121 --> 11:18.795
so you have this half developed because of that

11:18.996 --> 11:22.029
and this half developed because of the superego

11:22.230 --> 11:27.425
that you get these false and fake gurus.

11:28.097 --> 11:33.989
Now what happens sometimes, that when you get involved into

11:34.190 --> 11:45.012
this kind of superego behavior

11:45.213 --> 11:53.611
at that time it so happens that you might take over from that

11:53.812 --> 11:59.900
and start using it for your ego, that’s the worst type for you.

12:00.101 --> 12:06.814
At that time what you do is to act like the devils yourself,

12:07.015 --> 12:11.556
and once you start doing that your Ekaadasha is completely finished

12:11.757 --> 12:16.045
and then I don’t think it’s easy to get rid of it,

12:16.246 --> 12:22.615
it’s very difficult. But if it is one-sided it is much easier.

12:22.816 --> 12:27.337
So today is the day which is called as the Ekaadasha

12:27.538 --> 12:31.298
which is going to bring the transformation.

12:31.499 --> 12:33.767
When you are transformed

12:33.968 --> 12:38.048
so many things are automatically destroyed within you

12:38.249 --> 12:40.900
as you can see very clearly

12:41.101 --> 12:44.806
that all your misidentifications drop out.

12:45.007 --> 12:47.790
The misidentification that, “I am an American”

12:47.991 --> 12:52.681
that “I’m a Christian” or “I’m a Jew” “I am this” “I am that,”

12:52.882 --> 12:56.665
all these false misidentifications drop out

12:56.866 --> 12:59.472
and you becomes a naked human being first of all

12:59.673 --> 13:01.933
you are a human being

13:02.134 --> 13:06.800
and then a superhuman being without the ego,

13:07.001 --> 13:11.081
without the ego, so your ego is destroyed,

13:11.282 --> 13:15.550
your superego is destroyed, your conditionings are destroyed

13:15.751 --> 13:20.433
and all your false ideas about knowledge are destroyed.

13:20.634 --> 13:24.777
So what remains and emerges out is the reality.

13:24.978 --> 13:32.800
Now see when a flower becomes the fruit

13:33.001 --> 13:38.847
everything practically drops out of the fruit,

13:39.048 --> 13:43.402
of the flower you can say, like the Calyx is dropped out

13:43.603 --> 13:50.410
then the petals are dropped out and then the

13:50.611 --> 13:56.582
Epicalyxes is there that is also dropped
out, but what remains is the seed

13:56.783 --> 14:01.387
actually if you see, around the seed all these things develop

14:01.588 --> 14:05.489
and the fruit remains the rest of it drops out.

14:05.690 --> 14:09.942
In some fruits some part is used in some fruits

14:10.143 --> 14:14.782
nothingly is used, a very little shoot comes out as fruit

14:14.983 --> 14:18.993
and becomes the ffruit while the flowers are finished.

14:19.194 --> 14:27.641
So in us also whatever becomes Spirit remains,

14:27.842 --> 14:32.492
the rest drops out, and that is what it is when we call it

14:32.693 --> 14:39.226
the Ekaadasha which brings forth the transformation.

14:39.427 --> 14:45.108
And one has to understand we have to drop out many things.

14:45.309 --> 14:48.139
Some people I’ve seen they say, “What’s wrong?

14:48.340 --> 14:51.125
I’m smoking still my vibrations are alright.”

14:51.326 --> 14:55.297
Some say, “What’s wrong? I’m drinking still my vibrations are normal.”

14:55.498 --> 14:59.508
“I’m going to this guru still my vibrations are there.”

14:59.709 --> 15:02.813
“I’m having the same type of licentious life

15:03.014 --> 15:05.610
still my vibrations are there.

15:05.811 --> 15:11.118
Now it goes a very long way,

15:11.319 --> 15:16.126
vibrations are still there but suddenly they stop

15:16.327 --> 15:19.985
and you find you’re out of the bounds,

15:20.186 --> 15:24.188
you’re thrown out completely,

15:24.389 --> 15:26.992
but you do not feel how you are thrown out

15:27.193 --> 15:29.758
gradually you find like a tangent you go out

15:29.959 --> 15:32.797
and so one has to be careful about them.

15:32.998 --> 15:39.336
So within us lies a force which is centrifugal

15:39.537 --> 15:42.383
and a force that is centripetal ,

15:42.584 --> 15:47.125
so Ekaadasha’s force is centrifugal by which we are thrown out.

15:47.326 --> 15:51.164
Sahaj Yoga does not fall onto anybody’s feet,

15:51.365 --> 15:54.883
doesn’t request anyone, it doesn’t flatter anyone,

15:55.084 --> 15:59.547
if you want to be there, you have to be positively there

15:59.748 --> 16:01.711
and if you don’t want to be there

16:01.912 --> 16:05.133
it throws you much faster than what you want.

16:05.334 --> 16:07.344
That’s the trouble with Sahaj Yoga is

16:07.545 --> 16:10.396
and this is the loophole of Sahaj Yoga which I must tell you

16:10.597 --> 16:15.024
as a Mother, that it’s very anxious to throw you out.

16:15.225 --> 16:20.422
I’ll tell you when Christine, just now she told Me also,

16:20.623 --> 16:27.164
got engaged to Michael, half of them were thrown out

16:27.365 --> 16:31.211
because they had a conception that you must have a romance

16:31.412 --> 16:34.188
before marriage, without a romance if you have a marriage

16:34.389 --> 16:36.454
then there should be no marriage.

16:36.655 --> 16:39.743
I don’t know on what conception it is based

16:39.944 --> 16:42.259
but if you have the romance before the marriage

16:42.460 --> 16:44.501
what’s the fun of having the marriage?

16:44.702 --> 16:47.899
I mean it’s like if you have to give somebody a present

16:48.100 --> 16:50.844
you hide it, you keep it to that date

16:51.045 --> 16:54.039
and then give the surprise to the children,

16:54.240 --> 16:58.562
in the same way if you have the romance already done

16:58.763 --> 17:02.632
what’s the marriage? What’s the celebration for?

17:02.833 --> 17:07.044
It’s absolutely illogical, there is no romance in such cases

17:07.245 --> 17:09.817
actually we have seen that after the romance

17:10.018 --> 17:12.098
the marriage ends in a divorce.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.785
It’s always like that because you become stale

17:15.986 --> 17:18.388
and you find the romance you had before marriage

17:18.589 --> 17:21.615
was something a fantasy that has dropped out

17:21.816 --> 17:27.342
and now after marriage there is nothing left to enjoy

17:27.543 --> 17:31.522
so you’re fed up and next month you are in the divorce case.

17:31.723 --> 17:35.467
But the marriages that take place without the romance,

17:35.668 --> 17:39.655
kept all reserved for a particular day

17:39.856 --> 17:44.210
just for that day when you are going to have the real romance

17:44.411 --> 17:47.280
and real feeling of oneness, everything,

17:47.481 --> 17:53.288
in India it’s a very big thing you see the first night of the marriage.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.960
And that’s why our marriages last you know

17:57.161 --> 18:00.280
I would say I’m an old woman of sixty years, My husband’s sixty-three years

18:00.481 --> 18:02.964
and you can see how romantic he is still

18:03.165 --> 18:05.258
you see the romance never finishes,

18:05.459 --> 18:08.305
because it starts on an auspicious day

18:08.506 --> 18:11.125
with the sanction of the collectivity

18:11.326 --> 18:16.211
everybody taking interest in that romance,

18:16.412 --> 18:19.781
it is such a big thing to be married,

18:19.982 --> 18:23.836
all the people enjoying the marriage and enjoying.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.789
[YOGINI: Would you like to take some fruit, Mother?

18:26.990 --> 18:29.062
No, No, Thank you.

18:29.263 --> 18:30.960
So now,

18:31.161 --> 18:34.717
this kind of thing when happens to the people who are western people,

18:34.918 --> 18:36.998
people think romance is very important

18:37.199 --> 18:39.771
but I don’t think one can learn anything from

18:39.972 --> 18:42.232
the marriage system of the western people

18:42.433 --> 18:47.529
because all their marriage system is absolutely in a [DWINDLE DOWN?]

18:47.730 --> 18:49.998
there’s nothing to be learned from them as for as that,

18:50.199 --> 18:51.951
we can learn many other things

18:52.152 --> 18:55.545
for example we can learn how to operate a camera,

18:55.746 --> 19:00.615
but to operate a marriage it’s better you learn from Indians.

19:00.816 --> 19:03.810
We have a very solid system of marriage,

19:04.011 --> 19:06.296
first of all the way they are trained from childhood

19:06.497 --> 19:08.687
how to make a marriage successful

19:08.888 --> 19:10.703
such a lot of importance is given,

19:10.904 --> 19:13.492
then without the horoscope they won’t marry,

19:13.693 --> 19:16.265
without the auspicious day they won’t marry,

19:16.466 --> 19:19.507
everything they work out in such details

19:19.708 --> 19:22.913
so that the marriage cannot fizzle out,

19:23.114 --> 19:25.022
moreover it is working in a such a collective way,

19:25.223 --> 19:27.631
for example supposing My husband wants to trouble Me,

19:27.832 --> 19:30.201
say for example you see,

19:30.402 --> 19:35.553
so, the sister of My husband will take him to task,

19:35.754 --> 19:39.248
everybody can interfere if they try to do anything against

19:39.449 --> 19:43.740
the marriage, everyone in the family will be after the person

19:43.941 --> 19:48.326
who tries to break the marriage and so everyone knows that

19:48.527 --> 19:51.146
I’ll be left high and dry you see if I have a divorce,

19:51.347 --> 19:54.537
nobody has place in the society

19:54.738 --> 19:57.990
but in England when we went first we were shocked.

19:58.191 --> 20:00.834
They had no shame about this, they said, “I’m already divorced

20:01.035 --> 20:03.772
thrice and this is the fourth woman I am living with.”

20:03.973 --> 20:05.983
So shocking it was oh God.

20:06.184 --> 20:10.225
To us a divorce means worse than leprosy.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.741
Why are you divorced? What’s the problem?

20:13.942 --> 20:17.788
How can you be divorced? Such an auspicious thing is the marriage,

20:17.989 --> 20:22.132
such a blessing it is, it is God blessed how can you do it?

20:22.333 --> 20:25.648
It’s such a big fall and that’s how it works out

20:25.849 --> 20:29.652
and in no way we are less than you people as married

20:29.853 --> 20:34.457
because we can produce much more children than you can produce,

20:34.658 --> 20:38.145
and children only want to be born in India not anywhere else,

20:38.346 --> 20:41.020
you’ll be surprised that’s the problem we are facing.

20:41.221 --> 20:44.356
Our population problem comes from the point that

20:44.557 --> 20:47.895
the marriages are so successful, the people are so peaceful,

20:48.096 --> 20:52.981
the children hate to be married in the nightmares of New York,

20:53.182 --> 20:56.098
naturally because you don’t know where will be the mother tomorrow

20:56.299 --> 21:01.434
and where will be the father, now we are blamed for a high rate

21:01.635 --> 21:04.606
of fertility but what to do, children don’t listen

21:04.807 --> 21:07.895
they don’t want to go to all such places

21:08.096 --> 21:11.762
where there’s no stability for them

21:11.963 --> 21:14.934
specially the realized children,

21:15.135 --> 21:17.317
if they are of a very high quality they do

21:17.518 --> 21:20.090
I mean they have to be like they’re devils to get into this,

21:20.291 --> 21:23.254
so they may try or maybe they’re real devils

21:23.455 --> 21:28.332
they can take advantage of, but normally

21:28.533 --> 21:33.012
people who want peace in life, who want joy in life

21:33.213 --> 21:36.793
and the love of their parents want to be born in India.

21:36.994 --> 21:39.387
And that’s why

21:39.588 --> 21:43.246
recently you’ll find that India is growing so fast in population

21:43.447 --> 21:46.684
that we don’t know what to do about it.

21:46.885 --> 21:52.418
So this marriage system came in which shocked them

21:52.619 --> 21:55.481
because they couldn’t understand that there has to be a romance

21:55.682 --> 21:58.455
and this and that.

22:00.362 --> 22:05.716
Now the more understanding of Ekaadasha should be there,

22:05.917 --> 22:09.982
that we should not allow it to be built within us in anyway,

22:10.183 --> 22:13.021
because these are self-destroying things.

22:13.222 --> 22:15.927
It starts with doubting.

22:16.128 --> 22:21.341
When you start doubting Sahaj Yoga the build up starts

22:21.542 --> 22:26.357
and the doubting starts building up throughout the medhas,

22:26.558 --> 22:33.617
this is the plate here you see. And it can become a thick, big plate there,

22:33.818 --> 22:37.711
like today I saw that lady saying, “Touch wood,” you see,

22:37.912 --> 22:40.524
touch wood means this wood you see touch wood means

22:40.725 --> 22:43.290
there should be no wood here anymore you see

22:43.491 --> 22:46.126
or you can say touch stone.

22:46.327 --> 22:50.204
If you say something like a bragging you say, ‘No, no touch wood.”

22:50.405 --> 22:54.806
I am not meaning that, I mean people are quite conscious,

22:55.007 --> 22:57.876
unconsciously they say but they are quite conscious

22:58.077 --> 23:01.407
not to say something that would sort of give an idea

23:01.608 --> 23:05.954
of boastful nature or something bragging

23:06.155 --> 23:10.610
or something big so that it may go wrong.

23:10.811 --> 23:16.842
So they say touch wood, this is the wood. This is the Ekaadasha.

23:17.577 --> 23:21.923
So, we are quite conscious of this force building within us

23:22.124 --> 23:24.813
and now we have to be conscious that this force

23:25.014 --> 23:29.251
is going to transform people so today we are going to pray

23:29.452 --> 23:34.768
that this force has to transform America

23:34.969 --> 23:41.456
through its capacity to frighten people

23:41.657 --> 23:43.292
so that they come to Sahaj Yoga.

23:43.493 --> 23:46.776
Because when things have reached this stage of ego

23:46.977 --> 23:50.096
then when people say, “What’s wrong?”

23:50.297 --> 23:53.972
Like in England when I started talking first they said

23:54.173 --> 23:58.902
this is Victorian woman out of date absolutely useless,

23:59.103 --> 24:04.004
I said alright, I don’t say anything, but you’ll have such diseases

24:04.205 --> 24:07.793
that you’ll have to come back. That was the time they passed the law

24:07.994 --> 24:10.207
that homosexuality should be allowed,

24:10.408 --> 24:12.191
permissiveness should be allowed

24:12.392 --> 24:16.027
and all these things should be allowed

24:16.228 --> 24:18.793
and now you have AIDS.

24:18.994 --> 24:23.434
You have AIDS now here already operating,

24:23.643 --> 24:30.372
now the AIDS have given the fear of the Ekaadasha.

24:30.573 --> 24:34.458
Now have it, “What’s wrong?”

24:34.659 --> 24:37.877
What about that?

24:38.901 --> 24:44.981
So this awe and this fear is very important,

24:45.182 --> 24:50.465
it’s an extremely important thing that we must have the awe

24:50.666 --> 24:57.090
and the fear that God is Almighty

24:57.291 --> 25:00.770
and we are nothing before Him,

25:00.971 --> 25:05.817
here we have to remember that we are part and parcel of that God

25:06.018 --> 25:10.192
and that we have to awaken ourselves to the consciousness

25:10.393 --> 25:17.955
that He is the whole and we have become one with the whole.

25:18.156 --> 25:23.643
That’s how we are going to overcome our Ekaadasha.

25:24.167 --> 25:29.122
So today I bless you all with the power of Ekaadasha

25:29.323 --> 25:35.043
which is going to transform you. May God bless you all in your

25:35.244 --> 25:39.473
work which you are trying to do for the good of Americans

25:39.674 --> 25:42.809
it is your responsibility to save America,

25:43.010 --> 25:46.543
you know it is the Vishuddhi chakra and all the responsibility

25:46.744 --> 25:49.270
of Sahaj Yoga rests on Vishuddhi chakra

25:49.471 --> 25:53.028
so how important it is that the transformation is to take place

25:53.229 --> 25:55.684
unless and until the transformation comes in

25:55.885 --> 26:00.137
you will see it will not work out, you cannot talk to people,

26:00.338 --> 26:02.145
you cannot communicate with them,

26:02.346 --> 26:07.528
so you must pray that transformation process must start,

26:07.729 --> 26:10.708
must trigger, and must gallop

26:10.909 --> 26:14.294
and must go on spreading like wild fire,

26:14.495 --> 26:16.896
this should be our prayer today.

26:17.097 --> 26:21.417
May God bless you.

26:25.297 --> 26:30.234
May God bless you.
