1
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:13,653
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,813
First of all

3
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:18,953
We have to know what is the truth.

4
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:23,113
People are seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking all over.

5
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:34,653
But they don't know what they are seeking and what should they get after their seeking.

6
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:50,653
This seeking can lead you into many diverse directions. Some of them could be very very dangerous and absolutely misleading.

7
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:59,013
And many must have or also felt that. I'm sure there are many who have found it out.

8
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:07,653
But they think there is no way they can return.

9
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:11,753
The seeking is very simple to understand.

10
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:14,453
That you want to know yourself.

11
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:20,233
All the time we say : i want this, i like this, i this, i that.

12
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:26,353
But who is this I? What is it?

13
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:28,413
Who is this one myself?

14
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:34,353
What am i? Do i know anything about myself?

15
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:39,333
It's very superficial knowledge we have about ourselves.

16
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:44,713
Everybody have said, all the religions have said : you should  know yourself.

17
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:51,393
There is no difference on this one. Actually in all religions, if you're go into essence, there is no difference.

18
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:59,333
According to time it was little bit stressed on one point and sometimes on another point.

19
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:06,873
But the fundamental thing is that you have to know yourself.

20
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:10,393
How do you know yourself is the point.

21
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:16,203
People will say: do this, give up everything, give up your family,  give up everything.

22
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,839
Wear, this kind of dress cut your hair or shave your head and all that nonsense.

23
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,020
It's so outward.

24
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,400
If you put a little bit of your intelligence you'll see it's all outward.

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,720
It's so skin deep, it has no meaning.

26
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,700
So what has to happen?

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,440
We talk of a last breakthrough of the evolution.

28
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
How do you achieve it?

29
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,400
When you are evolved up to the stage of human beings.

30
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,180
We have to know one thing for definitely.

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,160
That there's something missing within us.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Otherwise world would have been a most beautiful place, the paradise to live in.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,420
But something's wrong with the human beings and what is that?

34
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,480
Is to understand how we have come through evolution.

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,640
And as human beings there are so many things of the animal stage lingering within us.

36
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:34,220
The way we talk, the way we try to oppress others, the way we talk to sort of dominate others.

37
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,900
The way we want to snatch everything, the way we are only worried about our food.This, that.

38
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:49,740
All this is not really a noble human beings sides.

39
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,080
These are all lingering from that animal instinct. All right. We have to accept it.

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,760
Because we are human beings so they are to be there.

41
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,840
Nothing so much frightening.

42
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,600
But also we have one more thing that we think.

43
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,460
And we think and think and think and think no end of ourselves sometimes.

44
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,119
Sometimes we think we should protest for this.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,620
Sometimes we feel that we must become very violent

46
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,280
All these things are coming from our human mind.

47
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,280
Animals won't be violent for something just for violence sake. They'll be violent, alright.

48
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,640
But for their own purpose of killing some animal or something.

49
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,300
But here we have groups and groups of people who just enjoy violence.

50
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:53,720
This is another development in the human awareness, i think, that we enjoy  destruction of others.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,780
But also there is a seeking.

52
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:05,880
This is the sign that people want their evolution, they want to evolve into a better personality.

53
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
That they want to become

54
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,659
something

55
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,550
which is complete.

56
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,540
How do you achieve it?

57
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,500
Now I must say that we have not achieved our evolution ourselves up to the human level.

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
So to achieve a higher

59
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,919
awareness

60
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,549
there must be some arrangement between us.

61
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,549
And that is the arrangement we are not aware of.

62
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,829
And that arrangement is that within you is the power.

63
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
It's your own power.

64
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,710
To give you this

65
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,319
last breakthrough

66
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,549
Through the awakening of that power, already you have been told about it.

67
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,620
It exists,  it's there.

68
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:04,440
And It is the right of every human being to get his self-knowledge, self-realization.

69
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,520
Sahaja,  Saha means born with you.

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
With you is born the right.

71
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,100
And why should we not ask our fundamental  rights

72
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,440
society that we should have our self-realization. Which is your own.

73
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:29,460
It is there already placed within you. You don't have to do anything, of course you can't pay for it.

74
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,560
How much did you pay for your evolution so far?

75
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,610
And how can it be different from different people?

76
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,969
Because in every human being this power, which we call as Kundalini exists.

77
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,820
Whether he is white, black, yellow, blue any color.

78
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,480
Whether he belongs to north or south, anyplace.

79
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,840
Whether he belongs to this country or that country.

80
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:03,520
They all have this power universally placed it their Kundalini.

81
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,940
Even if I say everybody has a heart.

82
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,300
So why should we have differentiation?

83
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
But this mind.

84
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,360
This human mind creates this differentiation and this problems saying that of course they are not of our country.

85
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,510
They don't belong to our group and like animals again we start getting into groups.

86
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,210
Groups of

87
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,610
different, I don't know, denomination. Like some people have their

88
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,860
fork and spoon put this way, so they are one group.

89
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,699
Some people drink coffee, so they have a group like that, you see. We are very good at forming groups.

90
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:52,390
This is also animal instinct, I think, that we try to form groups of such stupid things.

91
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,210
And then we can have wars.

92
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,840
Because we must fight. We are a group,something great, so we should fight others.

93
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,969
All these instincts that are within us are inherited.

94
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,929
They have come to us. They say it is in our genes.

95
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,580
Still, can we change the genes?

96
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Can we

97
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,820
transform

98
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,830
Our personality into something higher and for that

99
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,360
I tell you there is a power within us all of you have that power within you.

100
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,080
And what does it give you?

101
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,460
It  passes through six centers, as  told you, it nourishes it

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,640
it integrates it and

103
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,260
ultimately it pierces through the last fontanel bone area. We can call that actualisation or the baptism.

104
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,120
And is

105
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

106
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,550
Again, I say love

107
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,170
divine compassion.

108
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,170
And divine love.

109
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,400
So you get connected to that power which is all-pervading?

110
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:15,530
If you ask a doctor who runs our heart, he'll say it's the autonomous nervous system.But what, who is the auto?

111
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,660
Who does all these things?

112
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,020
Who does all the living work?Look at this flowers,beautiful.

113
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,480
Who has made these flowers such a different different flower?

114
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,500
How does this mother Earth differentiates and how she gives all these flowers?

115
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,040
Do we think about it? We take it for granted.

116
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,820
All living work we take it for granted, but it is done by this divine power.

117
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,300
Believe me. There is this divine power

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,400
around us which protects us, which looks after us, which guides us

119
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,020
and also

120
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,429
above all it loves us.

121
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
And it cares for us.

122
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,520
It wants, that we should all receive

123
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,720
the blessings of this all-pervading power.
