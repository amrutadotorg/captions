1
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,430
Dr. Warren has already talked to you 

2
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,680
about the different centers that we have within
ourselves, and you can see how beautifully

3
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,860
they are placed and how gradually when the
Kundalini rises, how She enlightens the innermost

4
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:03,390
core of the centers. There are three channels
in the central channel, and the innermost

5
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,060
channel is used by Kundalini to pierce through
for the first time. You can imagine Kundalini

6
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,720
to be made of many strands of energy tied
together just like a rope, and as the chakras

7
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:46,730
start opening more strands start getting awakened
and they pierce through these six centers;

8
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,910
but if a person after Realization just thinks
that he has got the Realization, then he doesn't

9
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:10,989
have to bother about it, may lose it for the
time being, for quite some time I should say,

10
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:19,019
and he'll have to work much harder to re-establish
his Self Realization.

11
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:27,799
I've seen many-a-times when we give Realization
to people they say, “Yes, we have felt it.”

12
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:36,169
They did feel it, everything happens, and
then they loose it because they have not established

13
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:46,130
their Realization properly, for which luckily
in every place wherever I go I see to it that

14
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,600
we already have a center established, then
you can go to that center and you can learn

15
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:04,859
from them how to establish your Realization.
That is a very, very important time which

16
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,040
must be taken into consideration.

17
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,040
There was a lady who had cancer, she was cured
of her cancer, she was perfectly all right

18
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:25,389
and she went back to her family, she was doing
very well, and after some time - a year or

19
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:37,169
so - she came back with another disease of
a very serious nature.

20
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,300
So I asked her, “How is it that you are
cured of cancer, now you get another disease?

21
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,790
Did you do anything about it?”

22
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,479
“No, Mother, I went back from here, everybody
says, ‘You are looking very fine.’ They

23
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,720
are all right, they were all quite surprised
how I was cured, and I never bothered to do

24
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,840
anything about it.”

25
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,840
So she got another trouble. You go on like
this, you cure one thing then you again cure

26
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:16,229
another thing. Like little children, you clean
them, then again they get out and soil their

27
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,310
clothes, again they are back in the bathroom,
then again you clean them, again they do the

28
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:29,310
same thing. So you have to mature, after Realization
you must in all wisdom and sensible behavior,

29
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:37,280
you must mature of it, otherwise it is a big
headache to Me and big headache to you, and

30
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,280
you can be quite lost also with it, because
if a seed is half-sprouted it is of no use

31
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,610
at all.

32
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,610
So if you want that you should really have
the complete bliss of Self Realization, you

33
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:02,020
have to become a little serious person about
it. Shallow temperament is not going to help

34
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,250
you, or looking at it as if like another guru
shopping business it is not going to work

35
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,960
out. You have to work to see that you establish
yourself, till you have established you are

36
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,729
not to work on other people but once you are
established you can start working on other

37
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:26,729
people, giving them Realization. There is
no need then for you to bother that you will

38
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,800
catch from others, or anything; but before
that you should not try to help others. First

39
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:40,449
help yourself, selfishness to begin with.
Unless and until you are all right and you

40
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:47,449
know all the methods of protecting yourself,
you are not to indulge into Sahaja Yoga practices

41
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:55,469
which helps others. But when you become an
expert, when you have an expertise then you

42
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:02,629
should do it. Like a mechanic who doesn’t
know how to repair a car, they spoil it more.

43
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,490
So better become an expert for which you don't
have to pay anything, you don't have to do

44
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,759
much about it but only to understand how you
have to move the Kundalini within you, how

45
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,759
you have to establish it back, what problems
you have and how you have to cure. You will

46
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,520
be surprised you won't be aware of problems
that you have.

47
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,639
One gentleman came and told Me, “Mother
everyone is coming and asking me, ‘what

48
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,069
about your father, what's the problem?’”

49
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,629
I said, “Everybody said the same?”

50
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,949
He said, “Yes.”

51
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,439
I said, “I also want to know, what about
your father?”

52
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,759
He said, “My father died very early in life,
and I always had a feeling that I had no father.”

53
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,759
That can be cured, and he developed asthma
with it, so everybody knows, those who know

54
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:01,520
one thing that is the truth about you. All
of them will say the same thing, even if it

55
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,819
is a small child, he will also come and ask
you that “Is your father all right?” Because

56
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:12,439
if he knows that this center, this center
on the right hand side means the father. So

57
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,389
he will also say the same and then he will
come and ask you, “what about your father?”

58
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:26,389
It is so remarkable sometimes the way people
see these things that they can't believe it,

59
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,569
but this is nothing, what you get is just
a wee bit of it.

60
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:38,569
But as Kundalini rises, on every center you
start getting the light of that center. At

61
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:47,180
the first center you get back your innocence,
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes

62
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,890
innocent, you are not filled with lust and
greed, you don't look at things with lust

63
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:03,850
and greed, but you look at things with innocence,
which is a very big thing that people have

64
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,850
lost and that you get back and such a person
develops many qualities. One of them is that

65
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:18,350
such a person is full of fragrance, such a
person has a tremendous gravity, tremendous

66
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,940
gravity, and such a person has tremendous
dynamism, and attraction is a bad word so

67
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,370
I don't want to use it, but magnetical.

68
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:41,370
His magnets is awakened within him, this is
the center of your magnet of the earth. Such

69
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:50,380
a person develops a tremendous sense of roots
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

70
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:58,079
he will know where to go. Like birds, you
place birds anywhere they know which side

71
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:05,079
is north, south, east, west. In the same way
you also develop your lost innocence and your

72
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:13,320
magnet within you by which you have proper
direction; but the highest of all you develop

73
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,320
the proper direction to wisdom which is the
wise thing to do. You just don't do stupid

74
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:28,190
things, you just don't do, even if you ever
try to do it, you will not do it, because

75
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:35,209
you know it is so stupid, just you don't do
it. I mean it is so simple to be wise than

76
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,779
to be stupid, because if you have to be stupid
you have to go out of the way to be stupid

77
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:50,779
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal
and wise is the easiest thing to do. But what

78
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,180
people do is to do things that would make
them more and more stupid, nonsensical, because

79
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,779
also some people told Me they do it, the reason
being they think they have a nuisance value.

80
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,170
Like in London now we have one funny stuff
going on, they call it what? “Punk rock.”

81
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,630
You see, it's a funny stuff. Now poor kids
they don't know what they are doing it, and

82
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:27,630
I think the only value of that punk rock system
is this: that they try to sort of make a nuisance

83
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,500
out of them so that people feel attracted
towards them or sort of a significance out

84
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,329
of them. But when you become a realized soul
you realize your significance, because you

85
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:52,329
understand you are part and parcel of the
whole and that your significance is to give

86
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:59,519
Realization to others, the highest of highest,
that's what you have to do now you are a saint,

87
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,790
and that’s how the whole attitude of cheapiness,
of outward shallowness finishes and you become

88
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:16,050
a serene, dignified personality. This is not
possible through any sermon, any lecture,

89
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:23,209
it's only possible when the Kundalini rises
you become like a very dignified child, very

90
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:27,000
dignified child.

91
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I've seen one beautiful painting done of Mother
Mary being taught first time. You see Her

92
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,269
as a child, She is a very dignified personality,
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

93
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:50,269
I've seen My own grandchildren who are not
very old but extremely dignified. They walk

94
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,769
like kings, behave like kings. In every behavior
you find there's such a dignity, they'll never

95
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:02,029
do something shallow, they never ask for anything,
they never weep for anything, they never cry

96
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:08,079
for anything, they are so dignified and they
understand it so well what is dignity is.

97
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,230
I don't have to tell them, because they are
born realized, in the same way you become,

98
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,680
nobody has to tell you that “do this, or
do that,” but you understand that you must

99
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,680
have self-respect. This happens to you automatically,
this is actualization, nobody has to tell

100
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,870
you that “you be dignified,” you just
become. I've seen people who were absolutely

101
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,759
absurd, even from this punk rock we got some
people and they were so changed that people

102
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,880
could not recognize them, but one thing bad
has happened with this punk rock that they

103
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,000
put some sort of dye in their head and since
then their eyes became very weak, because

104
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
these dyes I think made the optic globe covered
with some sort of a color and you can't see

105
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,720
properly, and the eyes became very weak and
it took some time for us to remove the effect

106
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,220
of those dyes from their head.

107
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,360
We go headlong, “what's wrong?” There
is nothing wrong in this world if it is a

108
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,670
stupid fool, but for a wise man there are
very many things which are absolutely wrong,

109
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:22,670
and there are very many things which are absolutely
correct, so you develop your wisdom by this

110
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,170
first center.

111
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:31,170
Now as the Kundalini rises She enlightens
your second center which we can call as the

112
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,490
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though
it is the third center. But second center,

113
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:43,490
you become extremely creative, extremely creative.
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had

114
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,009
no job.

115
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:48,649
And he said, “Mother, I have no job and
what should I do?”

116
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,230
I said, “All right, what do you want to
do?”

117
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,850
He said, “Whatever you say.”

118
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,560
I said, “All right, why don't you become
an interior decorator?”

119
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,750
He said, “Me? I don't know what is a teak
wood, I don’t know what is a rose wood,

120
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,670
how am I to become an interior decorator?”

121
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,360
I said, “You just use your vibrations.”

122
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,480
And you'll be surprised he earned million
of rupees out of that profession because you

123
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:18,480
become extremely creative, your sense of creation
becomes so subtle and so beautiful that you

124
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:26,160
start understanding art at such a high level
that people don't know how, when you are not

125
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,110
educated in art, how you can do it. I went
to Japan once, and they were having an Ikebana

126
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,959
competition or something, so I went to see
the Ikebana class and they requested Me, “Why

127
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,569
don't you do some flower arrangements?”

128
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:41,690
I said, “All right, I'll do.”

129
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:48,069
I did it and I got the highest marks without
knowing a word about Ikebana, just surprise

130
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:54,180
Me, I got the highest mark. I can do lots
of things which I've never done before like

131
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,410
architecture. I have built houses without
doing any architecture, I've done decorations

132
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,410
of the houses, I've done all kinds of things
without knowing how to it, because you become

133
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,120
you so creative.

134
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,310
Music you start understanding so much better.
There are people now in America, there's a

135
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,310
girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice, absolutely
hoarse voice, and she always used to go out

136
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,560
of tune.

137
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,160
So I told her, “You shouldn’t sing songs
before Me because it’s rather funny.”

138
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,279
She said, “Mother, why don't You give me
a good voice?”

139
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,279
I said, “You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll

140
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,389
be all right.”

141
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:40,740
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don’t you
sit down.]

142
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:47,170
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was … she tried
on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations, and

143
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:54,170
she sings so melodiously now that I tell you
she can be a great singer. So the creativity,

144
00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:01,170
that also is a blessing of your power of the
Goddess of learning. Boys who could not study

145
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:08,730
in the schools were absolutely duffers. Some
people brought this boy, recently I’ve received

146
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,780
a letter from him.

147
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,560
When he came to Me, his father said that “He
is going to be taken out of school because

148
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,550
he's good for nothing, he can not remember
anything, he's absolutely finished.”

149
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,140
I said, “All right, doesn't matter, let
him take to Sahaja Yoga.”

150
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,360
He got his Realization. Not only that he passed
with first class, but he got a scholarship.

151
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young

152
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,390
age. He wrote to Me, “Mother no one can
believe that a duffer like me has been so

153
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,560
much highly placed.” All the boys who got
scholarships in Maharashtra in schools, in

154
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,850
colleges and universities are Sahaja Yogis.

155
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:58,440
It is such a tremendous force that starts
working in you, if you try to give vibrations

156
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,440
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat
and such things which are very important for

157
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:17,940
life, any food, you will be amazed that the
food also grows so much more and the taste

158
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:26,460
is so good and it lasts you so longer. Like
one gentleman tried, a university professor

159
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:33,460
in agricultural college on some wheat, some
vibrations and he was amazed that when they

160
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,350
collected this wheat it was at least six times
more than normal, and when this wheat was

161
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:47,350
stored in a big hall like this, there were
so many other things, the rats who are always

162
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,770
a menace in India never touched that wheat.
They ate all the rest of it but never touched

163
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,100
the wheat.

164
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers,
of course the dogs and the cats - understand

165
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:11,580
it much more, they understand you, they know
that you are a saint. They'll never touch

166
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,300
you, they will never trouble you. Even a tiger
sees a saint, he never attacks. You can handle

167
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,770
a tiger very easily; this is the power of
a saint. So you develop a tremendous capacity

168
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:28,770
of creativity. The greatest capacity you have
then is of creating a new human being out

169
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,810
of a ordinary human being. This is the greatest
blessing that you have, that you transform

170
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:45,810
an egg into a bird and that is the epitome,
that is the spiritual power you have, by which

171
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:53,060
you can transform the whole human race into
a new race which has this fifth dimension

172
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,320
within yourself.

173
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,630
You can start talking on science now, we have
a scientist here and he's a done his science,

174
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:08,170
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that,
in chemistry and I explained to him about

175
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,690
this - where is the hydrogen and oxygen and
nitrogen and all that within us and he was

176
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:12,990
amazed.

177
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,980
He said, “Mother, how do you know all these
things?”

178
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,970
I said, “I don't know how I know, but I
know. That’s what it is, you just have a

179
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,030
look at this.”

180
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,970
And he was amazed how I was telling him about
spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

181
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,110
He said that “For this I had to study so
much.”

182
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,070
I said, “For Sahaja Yog you don't have to
study.” A little bit you know and immediately

183
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,310
you click the point. Now this is the second
thing that you know in your learnings, in

184
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:44,670
your education you are all right, but the
mastery of this center comes, the mastery

185
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:51,670
of this center comes when you know the pure
knowledge, the pure knowledge of handling

186
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:58,750
the Kundalini, the pure knowledge of Spirit,
the pure knowledge of the blessings of God,

187
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:05,900
of Ritambhara Pragya. If you know that, that
is the highest that you achieve gradually

188
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,900
as you grow, because when these centers starts
expanding on the sides, you start expanding

189
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,140
in your personality, in your sensitivity and
in your evolutionary ascent, so that is how

190
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,710
you start growing from one to another to another
to another.

191
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,460
Now the third center that we have actually,
this is the second center because the third

192
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:38,460
center arises, this Swadishthana arises out
of the Nabhi, is a very, very important center,

193
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,980
is the center of your seeking as he has told
you. Your compete priorities change, complete

194
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,530
priorities change, because the joy that you
get out of Sahaja Yoga, the joy you get out

195
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:59,530
of this meditation, out of the feeling that
grows in you all the time, like a beautiful

196
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:09,330
torrential rain of joy that fills you, your
life and everybody's life, you don't care

197
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,120
for cheap type of entertainment. You feel,
you seek other Sahaja Yogi, you want to meet

198
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,130
another Sahaja Yogi, you don't want to meet
anybody else. If there is an actor coming,

199
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,410
or some big man is coming, “All right, let
him come, I'm going to see such and such person.”

200
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:35,410
It is such a different personality that one
day - I will tell you how it happens - there

201
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,280
was a girl, a diplomat, she's a diplomat who
is a realized soul and she happened to go

202
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,590
to Sicily. And she was eating her food, suddenly
she felt there is some vibrations coming down,

203
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:53,020
she looked around, the other one was also
looking at her, she said, “Are you Mataji's

204
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,560
disciple?”

205
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,940
And she said, “Yes, I am Mataji's child.”

206
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,360
They both got up and just hugged and said,
“Such joy Mother in that far-fetched place

207
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,790
of Sicily to find a Sahaja Yogi.”

208
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:10,800
And then they stayed together and they wouldn’t
go anywhere else but they said, “Now this

209
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,350
is the enjoyment.” Just the company of a
Sahaja Yogi is such an enjoyment.

210
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,100
I've seen these people when they go to India,
the people are not so rich, poor people - they

211
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,090
have little, little huts - but when they go
they go there, you should see the love, the

212
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:32,090
rapport, and that makes Me so happy, so happy,
the way they love each other, the way they

213
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:38,780
understand each other, the way they help each
other and the only the company, for the first

214
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,780
time they start enjoying. We were once in
a hotel staying in Calcutta and with two Sahaja

215
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,080
Yogi with Me. They were in the other room,
quite far away, they could not get a room

216
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,030
close to Me, and one gentleman came for his
Realization, he came to My feet, when he got

217
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,750
his Realization it was a tremendous happening
and they came rushing from there.

218
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,110
I said, “What happened?”

219
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,110
They said, “We felt the vibrations, we felt
the vibrations from there, Mother, so we have

220
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,490
come to receive the vibrations.”

221
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:16,490
And they came and they felt the vibrations.
So this man was so great that his vibrations

222
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:22,750
attracted them and they came down. They were
just enjoying that as if they were enjoying

223
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,750
a big flower with lots of fragrance. What
vibrations, what vibrations! The fellow got

224
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:33,750
up and said, “Very nice. They are enjoying
my vibrations. Now I'm going to enjoy your

225
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,480
vibrations.”

226
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,480
For the first time you start enjoying your
fellow man because everyone is a beautiful

227
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:50,090
personality, a glorious, fragrant, joyful
personality; but because you cannot feel the

228
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,650
other person, and because the other person
does not emit, you are all the time quarreling.

229
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,950
Even husband-wife quarreling, father-mother
quarreling, this one quarreling, that quarreling.

230
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,110
In Sahaja Yoga there is hardly any time for
people to quarrel. The other day I had a lady

231
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,940
who came to see Me, and she was trying to
put her point and there were about five-six

232
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:16,640
Sahaja Yogis, and everybody was putting the
same point and she was amazed.

233
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,700
She said, “I've never seen such concord,
such friendship, such understanding, all of

234
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,980
them supporting each other, nobody is cutting
anyone.”

235
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:34,600
Such a society has to develop. It’s such
a nourishing, soothing, invigorating society,

236
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,600
and you forget about getting bored, boredom
goes out of life, you never get bored, you

237
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:47,330
enjoy yourself or you enjoy the company of
Sahaja Yogis and it is very different level

238
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:53,610
that you come of - that is what, that land
you have to reach within yourself.

239
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,610
Now the greatest thing that happens as a result
of this center seeking, that you start seeking

240
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:07,830
other seekers, you try to find out “where
is the seeker?” If you hear somebody is

241
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,560
a seeker, you go and see. If you hear about
someone that some people are lost there, they

242
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,730
were seekers, but they went there lost, you
all rush there. It is like a person who is

243
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,730
like a, what you call a guard on the seashore
you know, there are guards kept for salvaging

244
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:34,450
people, and that is how you become. You suddenly
see somebody sinking, you just go. In Bombay

245
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,320
there was a case they announce that “there’s
a lady who is going to die, if somebody can

246
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,850
come and help her, it will be a great thing.”
They all rushed there; they saved her.

247
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:51,010
Now the interests changes completely, and
you start really helping people and not feeling

248
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:58,010
that you are helping them, not at all. But
the surrounding portion of that, which is

249
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:06,280
the void, is the best, which is affected by
your awakening, that you become the virtue

250
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:13,660
itself. Nobody has to tell you that you be
virtuous, when you are awakened you become

251
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:21,910
a virtuous person, you enjoy your virtues,
you enjoy being good, you enjoy being nice,

252
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,230
you really enjoy it. And that enjoyment comes
to you as a blessing because the virtue itself

253
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:40,560
is so strengthening, so powerful that anyone
who is harmed or troubled or tortured or put

254
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:51,690
down, you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

255
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

256
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:07,320
I'm just a lady and single-handed I told them
who these people are, how they are going to

257
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,180
loot you, and what they are going to do; but
in this country nobody can think of one genuine

258
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:20,180
person who could be really genuine. It was
the problem that time, but with this awakening

259
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,340
within you of the virtuous nature, you just
know what is virtue and what is not virtue.

260
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,690
I don't have to tell you; I don't say “don't
do this, don't do that.” I never say that,

261
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:39,690
it just happens, because when the virtue starts
developing, the vibrations improve and you

262
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:46,820
feel extremely joyous. We have lost our virtues
because there is no joy out of it, no reward.

263
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,790
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer; if
somebody's good, he has to suffer; is somebody's

264
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:03,790
kind, he thinks he has to suffer; but after
getting Realization you are rewarded for your

265
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,170
virtues.

266
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,900
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it’s
so surprising, like once there was a lady

267
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,020
who came to see Me, she was a refugee, and
I had a big house.

268
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,420
So I said, “All right come and stay with
Me.”

269
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,020
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, “What's this? You don't know her,

270
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,700
who she is, her husband, whether he is her
husband or not, just given her two rooms.

271
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,470
It's not good!”

272
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,630
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter. I
know for nothing is going to happen, let her

273
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,330
be here.”

274
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,850
So they wouldn't also go against Me. They
said, “All right, if you say so.”

275
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:40,170
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.
Then she become a very well-known actress

276
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,570
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady,
but somebody told Me that she is the same

277
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,720
lady. I said, “Maybe.”

278
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,130
Then one day you see, they wanted to make
a film for our Sahaja Yoga, so they said,

279
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,580
“We can ask this lady to act, because she
is a good actress.”

280
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,910
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don't
tell her I am here, otherwise she will have

281
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,870
no choice. I will not go and see her. You
just ask her.”

282
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,580
They went and ask her, they said, “Will
you be actress?” and all that.

283
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,950
She said, “I'll try.” This, that she was
saying.

284
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,250
But on the day on when they were going to
open the film I went there, she saw Me, she

285
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,090
was so amazed, she said, “Oh God, You are
the One, You are the One Who is sponsoring

286
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,840
this, Oh, I’ll give my life for Her!”
She just came forward, she said, “Have anything

287
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,720
you like, I have nothing to say, I am so sorry
that you never told me that She's there.”

288
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,340
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

289
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:38,620
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person and so many people become

290
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,630
your friends in this world. Your have to just
tell you are coming, there will hundred people

291
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,220
at the airport to receive you. There will
be so many friends all over the world for

292
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,110
you, you will be amazed. It's such a tremendous
thing happens, because now you all are awakened

293
00:30:54,110 --> 00:31:00,240
in that Primordial Being and you have become
one with each other. You can feel it, that

294
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,740
oneness, that unison that we are all not only
human beings but we are yogis, we are super

295
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,720
human beings, and we have to look after the
whole world. That feeling of compassion is

296
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,720
so overwhelming that all little, little stupid
things just fall off, there's no place for

297
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,880
that. This actually happens and has happened
with many.

298
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,390
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories, but

299
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,190
there are many, some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome, some them

300
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,230
used to fight so much in the beginning that
I thought, “How are they going to be all

301
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:44,100
right?” But today I find them as great friends
and very great yogis. So this is the center

302
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,610
where your religion is awakened. And what
is a religion? Word comes from “religo,”

303
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:55,140
in Sanskrit it means dharma, “Dhariyatisa
Dharma,” the sustenance, your sustenance,

304
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:01,530
your valances is your religion. As every atom,
carbon has four valances, and in the same

305
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:07,400
way you have ten valances, these are the ten
commandments that were told to you and you

306
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,400
become that, you just become. I don't have
to tell you as commandments but they become

307
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:21,870
your beautiful ornaments within yourself.
This happens automatically, so spontaneously

308
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,020
you become that.

309
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:28,920
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother. He came

310
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:34,530
to see Me, and he was rather adamant and little
angry when he came to see Me because he thought,

311
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,080
“Why am I trying to do this kind of thing?”

312
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,500
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
“I'm amazed, you know, I've been giving

313
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:47,750
lectures in the church for years together,
but I could not achieve anything. How have

314
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:53,980
You transformed these people? The drug addicts
have suddenly become such good people that

315
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,840
they have given up drugs, alcoholics have
given up alcohol. How is it without telling

316
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,340
them anything?”

317
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:05,450
I said, “Everything is within them. As soon
as the light comes you can see everything.

318
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,820
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress, this is anti-life,

319
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,570
you just give up. Only thing you have to have
the light within you.”

320
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:20,280
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said, “Really, that should be done, is

321
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,340
to transform them.”

322
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,230
But I said, “You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons, you transform them

323
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:33,230
by giving them the real second birth, real
baptism.” And I must say that Calvinist,

324
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:39,240
of all the persons, Calvinist in Geneva have
accepted Me and they think that this is the

325
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,170
only way they can transform you.

326
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:48,170
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided

327
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,280
people, they have accepted to see the result
of everybody who is open-minded person, who

328
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,400
thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends. We'll see

329
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,100
one day that this is the way it has to be.
God has given us this power, we have got a

330
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,190
Spirit within us, we should try to awaken
that and we should accept it, not because

331
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:18,869
I'm doing it, you can do it also. So this
thing happens to you with this chakra.

332
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:23,849
Now with the another chakra on top, that is
one - as he has told the diseases, I'm telling

333
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:30,020
you the positive side of it - when this chakra
is caught up he must have told you, you develop

334
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:37,020
breast cancer and all that. But when it is
awakened, you get all the security of the

335
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:44,730
world, you are never insecure, you are never
bothered, you have no fear of anyone. You

336
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:50,589
do not have to suggest yourself that “you
should not have fear or anything,” you just

337
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:57,589
become fearless, there is no nothing like
fear, there's no reaction to any threat or

338
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,289
anything. Like the gentleman who came here,
just to beat Me now, I was just looking at

339
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:08,130
the drum, and the fellow was getting frightened
of Me, he was going backwards, backwards,

340
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:14,440
he would not come forward. But you don't develop
any fear of at all about anyone, because you

341
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,150
are standing on truth, like Christ. At the
time when He was challenged, you must know

342
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:28,150
when Mary Magdalene was beaten up, He stood
up. He had nothing to do with the prostitute,

343
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:33,220
such a virtuous man, He was virtue personified,
He stood up, He said, “Those who have not

344
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,710
committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me.”
He was sure nobody can do it because He was

345
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,950
an authority of virtue.

346
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:46,950
I, as I told you, I am just a woman and I
spoke openly with the names of these people

347
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,490
and told of what they are going to do, and
how they are going to possess you. And people

348
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,480
came, they were frightened, they said, “What
are You doing?”

349
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:02,480
So you get rid of all your fear, but you do
not dominate anyone, you love, in your love

350
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:10,890
you are secured. It is not by domination but
the security that you are love, you are compassion.

351
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:21,279
And the power of love is the highest of all,
that you stand in complete peace and bliss.

352
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,369
This happens to you when the central thing
comes up. There are many other things happen,

353
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:33,250
you can become a poet, I mean so many things
happen with this, because you become such

354
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:40,250
a compassion, such a compassion. And when
this compassion starts working you are given

355
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
all the help that is needed.

356
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,099
Then the another chakra - I am going a little
fast because after all you understand that

357
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:55,109
there isn't much time today, I've been speaking,
and speaking every day, it’s a marathon

358
00:36:55,109 --> 00:37:02,109
race for Me, so I'll try to make it short
now - it's the Vishuddhi Chakra as he told

359
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,400
you is very important, this is America. Vishuddhi
Chakra is America in the Universe. America

360
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:18,470
is the Vishuddhi Chakra and the star is the
Saturn. There are seventeen of them, sixteen

361
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:29,730
is the planet moving round, there are sixteen
centers there and the seventeenth is the Vishuddhi

362
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:36,730
itself. Is a very important thing that this
center is America, so America has the responsibility

363
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:45,569
of transformation. They have to take up the
responsibility of transforming the whole world.

364
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:54,829
Instead of that they themselves are getting
ruined, they are killing themselves. There

365
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:02,140
is no fear from outside I tell you, we are
going to be ruined from inside. What a responsibility

366
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:09,799
you have and what we are doing you should
see to that. That’s why so many seekers

367
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:16,799
are born here, but they do not feel the responsibility
of transformation. They will, one day it will

368
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,480
come, they will have to feel it, once they
are awakened I'm sure they will feel that

369
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:27,509
responsibility.

370
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:34,509
This very important center as he must have
told you, by the virtue of this on the gross

371
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:44,589
we develop a face which is very relaxed and
attractive and good looking. We develop eyes

372
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:54,309
which are full of compassion; we develop a
face which is innocent, which is very smooth

373
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,440
and which has got a capacity to express its
feeling. The smallest of feelings can be expressed

374
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:13,859
through this center. It looks after your nose,
yours ears, everything improves with this.

375
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:20,859
You develop - now I can't hear anything if
a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me. It is a very

376
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,529
funny thing, unless and until that person
is very close I just can't hear what he is

377
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:32,369
saying, to Me, it is all what you call “blah,
blah, blah.” But a Sahaja Yogi, if he speaks

378
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:35,019
to Me I can hear very well.

379
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:42,019
The whole thing changes, the whole sensitivity
changes, you start understanding what music

380
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:50,960
is good for your Spirit; you start understanding
what is good for your eyes to see, because

381
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:59,319
you don't want like to see that is something
that is horrid, you just don't enjoy it. You

382
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,000
feel like vomiting - you see something horrid,
you just feel like vomiting. You become so

383
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,950
sensitive you can't imagine, to virtue and
to goodness.

384
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:14,680
Automatically it happens to you, I don't have
to tell you. I've seen people have changed

385
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,680
overnight. The whole idea is that the light
has to be brought in for you to see for yourself,

386
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:27,769
and when it happens you'll be amazed, you
become such a different, wonderful person.

387
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:34,769
There's everyone in America has Abraham Lincoln
within them, which has to be just awakened

388
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:42,269
and you'll find that that great personality
can be shown in you, when it happens to you.

389
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:50,430
It has to happen to all of you to feel that
greatness that lies hidden within.

390
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:56,210
I cannot elaborately tell you about Vishuddhi
Chakra what they call the Krishna consciousness,

391
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:02,450
but not this Krishna consciousness which has
made people actual beggars, they are begging

392
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:07,700
on the streets. You go in India in the villages,
about they were going to beat these people.

393
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,749
They thought they are Krishna consciousness,
they wouldn’t get places in the hotels because

394
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:15,670
they thought they are Krishna consciousness,
because these people were lost, they had no

395
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:21,269
money left with them. Now they are begging
in India, imagine. How can we afford to have

396
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:25,279
these beggars there? They have no money with
them, they can not come back, they don't know

397
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:32,279
what to do with them, so many you will find
in the villages just begging. So this kind

398
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:39,999
of thing that - imagine a person who is being
blessed by Shri Krishna Who is the Deity on

399
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,829
this center, should beg!

400
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:52,069
He's the One Who is the giver of complete
wealth, why should we beg? This is the thing

401
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:58,009
they don't understand, just the opposite of
what they are suppose to be. There are lots

402
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:04,430
of stories of Krishna how He blessed people
with wealth. It is to be seen sometimes, if

403
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:09,579
you have time, I may have time then we might
be able to see all those beautiful things

404
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:12,259
that He did.

405
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:19,259
So the other chakra is important, is the Chakra
of Christ. This center is very important because

406
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:25,680
this is the gate through this you have to
pass to your destination which is the limbic

407
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,240
area. So Christ is the gate, many people are
shouting, “it's only He can save.” Where

408
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,369
is He now? Is He here? When He was living,
they talked of Ibrahim, when He came then

409
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:42,640
they said, “You are not the One. It was
Moses. You are not the One.”

410
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,150
They denied Him, defied Him. Now when He's
dead, then we think, “It is Christ.” Now

411
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:54,160
I have come, He's talked about Me, if you
read Bible you'll find He’s talked about

412
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,210
Me very clearly there and I have to do My
job and I have come. You are going to say

413
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:05,160
that it was Christ Who has to do it. If Christ
could do it, why did He say that “I'm going

414
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,809
to send you a comforter”? He talked of future,
didn’t He? Why did He say such a thing?

415
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:14,259
We should find out why did He say that “I
will send you the Holy Ghost and the Comforter

416
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:19,259
and the Redeemer and a Counselor”? Why did
He say that? Why not look forward to that?

417
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:24,700
Because we are today after Christ. People
don't want to see this point, they want to

418
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,299
depend on Christ because He's in their pocket,
they can use Him the way they like.

419
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:36,299
When He has talked, He has said, “Why not
see the point?” If this is what Christ is,

420
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:45,509
then it is such a bad thing because people
say, “Christ was no good.” They say, “What

421
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:51,470
has Christ given us?” Christians nations,
what have they done, what have they achieved?

422
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:58,470
It's a bad name to Him if you do not see completion
of His work. I'm here to complete His work

423
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:05,759
and when you do not complete His work, His
half-work done in a very half-way will bring

424
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,900
bad name to Him.

425
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,130
Why not people who claim about Christ understand
that what others have to say about it? If

426
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,960
you want to know about Christians, go and
ask the Jews; and if you want to know about

427
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,819
the Jews, go and ask the Muslims; and if you
want to know about the Muslims, go and ask

428
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:27,819
the Hindus. There are all in a doldrum. Nobody
has any understanding that they are worshiping

429
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:35,099
or they are admiring or advocating a flower
which belongs to one tree of life. They have

430
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:42,749
all plucked those flowers, “This is mine,
this is mine, in my pocket,” and fighting.

431
00:44:42,749 --> 00:44:49,749
If religion means fighting and quarreling,
it is not a religion at all. If it is integration,

432
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:52,869
then it is a religion.

433
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:59,190
In Sahaja Yoga you'll find that they are all
together. Christ has said, very clearly, “Those

434
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:06,190
who are not against Me are with Me.” Who
are those people? Try to find out. For that

435
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:13,130
you have to little bit go out of Bible. In
the Bible how much do you have Christ there,

436
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:18,529
for three years? Nobody allowed Him to live
for three years, and if they could, they would

437
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:20,059
also kill Me.

438
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:26,170
Not easy, He wanted to play the drama, otherwise
He would have finished all of them, in no

439
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:33,170
time. So He has said that “You are to be
resurrected first, and then that's how you

440
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,369
will be judged.”

441
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:40,970
And the Day of Judgment is today, this is
the Day of Judgment, that's why you are confused,

442
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,819
this is the Day of Judgment where you will
be judged and how are you going to be judged?

443
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:51,730
Through your Kundalini. Your Kundalini is
going to be awakened and you'll be judged

444
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,440
where you are. That's what it is, and those
who will be calling Me, “Christ, Christ”

445
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,380
I will not look at them, that's what it is.
By calling Him “Christ, Christ” you do

446
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:09,329
not become Christians, you have to get your
Realization, your baptism in the actual sense.

447
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:14,259
It has to be an actualization. I'm telling
you that if you miss the point, you have missed

448
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:21,259
it for ever and ever. Be careful on that point.
It's very important. Don't run after things

449
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:29,420
which have no meaning to your consciousness.
Try to raise yourself up to this point and

450
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,569
understand that the time has come for you
to transform, this is the time of your judgment

451
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:41,910
and you have to get to it in a very big way.
The shallow things and all this will be finished.

452
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:48,900
What is America or what is any country in
the eyes of God? Nothing. If they do not take

453
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:55,900
to His ways, all will be treated like waste,
thoroughly waste, it's a wasteland. But if

454
00:46:56,059 --> 00:47:03,059
you rise, thousands and thousands and millions
and millions can be saved. Try to rise, try

455
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,430
to understand your own responsibilities, that
is very important.

456
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:16,430
Today is the last day and the last center
which is the Sahasrara, is the integration,

457
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:23,470
integration of your being, of physical, mental,
emotional being, it takes place. Is integration

458
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:31,009
of all the Deities, of all the Prophets, all
the great works that they have done, integration

459
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:38,009
of all the scriptures, everything takes places
when this Sahasrara is opened out, when you

460
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,759
become the Spirit.

461
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:44,829
This is a much more difficult job, I know,
because if you don't have to transform people

462
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:51,410
it is very easy to talk about it and get away.
But I have to transform, not only transform

463
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:58,410
but you have to become, you cannot become
a Sahaji Yogi by paying Me, by saying things,

464
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:04,180
by arguing, by showing up, you can only become
Sahaji Yogi by going within yourself, face

465
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:11,180
up to it, see for yourself. I am here to help
you in every way possible. Whatever is possible

466
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:17,789
we'll try to do it, but you all should also
understand your responsibility.

467
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:24,720
It is not a joke now, it’s no more a joke.
It's not like Sunday morning you get up and

468
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,460
go to church, or Monday morning you go somewhere
else in the temple, and Tuesday morning you

469
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:37,460
go to see Siddhivinayaka [Temple of Shri Ganesha
- SG] and another day you go to a mosque.

470
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:41,999
It is not like that. It is a very serious
thing which we must understand. We are at

471
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:48,400
the brink of destruction, be careful about
it. We must do things so that the blessings

472
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,079
of God comes to upon us and that we are saved.
It is a very serious thing, and the responsibility

473
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:01,079
is much more on all the people who are getting
Realization, so do not treat it lightly. You

474
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:04,499
all, I hope, will take it seriously.

475
00:49:04,499 --> 00:49:11,499
Thank God there is a nice seminar we are having
after this for three days, you can come down

476
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,150
there, they have charged you very little,
we don't have to make any profit of out you,

477
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:22,230
the only profit I can make is that you get
your profits, that's all. So please take it

478
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,999
up seriously, work it out seriously, and I
tell you, out of you will come out those people

479
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:34,730
who will build that foundations of that construction
which is going to come. Please don't waste

480
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,140
your time in useless things, get to it.

481
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:45,140
Any one of you can do it. I bless you with
My whole heart and know that I love you very

482
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,380
much. If you have any problems, you can write
to Me, but don't write to Me about your family

483
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,450
problems and this and that, it's a headache
to Me, there is no need to write. Of course

484
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,589
I'm a mother, if you have problems you can
write but some people write ten pages saying,

485
00:49:58,589 --> 00:50:04,039
“my wife is fighting me.” It's bit too
much. You should write to Me about the problems

486
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:10,029
which concern the whole country, concern the
whole world. Widen yourself and that’s how,

487
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:16,559
though you may think that you are very unassuming
simple people, you are the ones who are going

488
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,079
to be, not those who are successful, they
are blinded by their success; not those who

489
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,710
are rich, they are not going to enter into
the Kingdom of God; not those who have a big

490
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:32,710
name, no. It's you, you are going to enter
into the Kingdom 

491
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:02,970
of God.

492
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:13,299
May God bless you.

493
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:54,630
[Self Realization]

494
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:15,299
Now, all the angels have a seat, now, put
your hands towards Me like this, and close

495
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:54,309
your eyes, the vibrations are so much today,
nothing to do. Just so much vibrations tonight,

496
00:53:54,309 --> 00:54:01,309
it's tremendous. Just close your eyes, you'll
feel the cool breeze, most of you, close your

497
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:16,269
eyes please.

498
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:23,269
You just put your right hand on the head and
see if there is a cool breeze coming out,

499
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:30,890
little higher, on top of your head.

500
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:37,890
Hmm, it’s there. Now put your right hand
towards Me and put the left hand and see,

501
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:46,769
little higher, about six inches higher, six
inches higher, change over, again, now put

502
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:11,680
your hands up like this absolutely, close
the eyes and ask, “Is this the breeze of

503
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:23,460
the Holy Ghost” or ask the question “Mother,
are You the Holy Ghost?

504
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:41,450
You feel the cool breeze? Good, it's tremendous
today. May God bless you all.

505
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:58,690
Those who have not felt any cool breeze, please
raise your hands. One, two and three. Are

506
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:07,950
keeping all right? You are not well? All right,
doesn't matter, if you are not well maybe

507
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,829
you may not feel today but you'll get well
and then you'll feel it, so it doesn't matter.

508
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:27,150
There's one or two persons who have not felt
it, it’s so tremendous today, May God bless

509
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,130
you.

510
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:35,130
You may give your addresses to these people,
let them know where you are, also you can

511
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:42,509
take address for the seminar, if you want
to come, they are going to arrange a transport

512
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:48,160
for you to go to Santa Cruz. Thank you very
much.

513
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:55,160
I say goodbye to you, after a year I’ll
definitely will come to Los Angeles again,

514
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,930
those who haven't cool breeze should keep
their hands raised. These boys will come and

515
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:05,170
see you. All right, those people who haven't
got it, please keep your hands slightly raised

516
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:12,170
so some people will come and see you, little
higher so that they'll come and see you. Here

517
00:57:17,749 --> 00:57:18,339
just have a look.

518
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:21,380
Man in the Audience: I didn’t hear Your
last question. I didn’t understand what

519
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:21,630
You asked about the Holy Ghost.

520
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:28,380
Shri Mataji: Just to know that I am the Holy
Ghost.

521
00:57:30,049 --> 00:57:34,799
Man in the Audience: You are Holy Ghost?

522
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,950
Shri Mataji: Yes. Otherwise how will you recognize?

523
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:42,749
Man in the Audience: The Bible says that God
is the Holy Ghost.

524
00:57:42,749 --> 00:57:46,989
Shri Mataji: Bible never says that. You don’t
understand that. You don’t teach Me Bible.

525
00:57:46,989 --> 00:57:53,989
[Man keeps interrupting Shri Mataji] It doesn’t
say. You don’t tell Me. You have no knowledge.

526
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:32,539
Don’t disturb others. If you are such a
good person you ...
