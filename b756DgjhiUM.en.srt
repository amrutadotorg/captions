1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,163
Today is a sad day for Me because

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,772
we'll be now parting.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,996
I may not be able to meet you in Bombay.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:26,330
May be for a year this may not happen for some of you,

5
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:41,747
and I would like to give you

6
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:49,747
a little advice about the growth within yourself.

7
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,747
It is believed by people

8
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:09,247
that God is helping us

9
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,038
and we are in His kingdom.

10
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:16,955
So whatever happens He looks after us.

11
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,247
It is true

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,871
but as you are the instrument of the God

13
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:28,497
you have to also look after yourself.

14
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,080
For today's delay

15
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,664
I would like to apologize

16
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:35,497
but the delay comes

17
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:39,163
because from Poona Mr. Kulkarni was to come

18
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:41,996
and see us do this puja.

19
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:45,372
Now I told him .?..

20
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,996
that his wife is a negative lady,

21
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:52,664
and he doesn't understand his own importance, I would say.

22
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:56,288
As a leader you must understand your importance.

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,080
And another person who came,

24
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:00,497
he asked, "Why don't you come with me?"

25
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:02,247
He said, "I have to come with my wife."

26
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,247
And that's how this delay has taken place

27
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:07,664
because he's not here.

28
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:09,789
He said he'll come for puja

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,497
so the main thing was first to arrive here in time

30
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:16,163
without a negative force pulling him.

31
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:19,497
So we conclude that

32
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,080
it is important that first of all we should know

33
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:26,664
that in any way we should not try

34
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:30,163
to have  any negative forces attacking us

35
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:33,664
or involving us or attaching to us.

36
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,789
She may be your wife,

37
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:36,913
may be your husband,

38
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,205
may be your son, may be your daughter,

39
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:42,205
may be anyone.

40
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,205
You must see that that person is negative

41
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:48,330
through vibrations

42
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:52,789
and don't have anything to do with such a person.

43
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,996
Don't have, never listen to such a person,

44
00:02:57,288 --> 00:03:00,288
never agree to what that person says

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,288
and do as you please

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,871
because in vibrations you will know

47
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,913
that the person  is negative.

48
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,330
Of course that doesn't give you a hand

49
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,413
to sort of a destroy another person

50
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:17,038
or to completely

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,955
finish Sahaja Yoga in that person.

52
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,163
But on the contrary with love

53
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:29,664
and proper advice you have to tell that person

54
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:34,163
that, "You are being negative, you are a negative person.

55
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:36,871
We are getting negative vibrations from you."

56
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:41,372
Now that person may persist on the negativity,

57
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:45,664
may be because he does not know how to get out of it

58
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,163
or may be she does not know how to get rid of it

59
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,121
or may be laziness.

60
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,830
May be that her arrogance,

61
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,913
because such people can be very arrogant

62
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:58,330
and adamant and high-handed,

63
00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:00,330
could be very arbitrary also

64
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:03,121
and could be so intelligent

65
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:06,747
that they would cheat themselves with their own intelligence.

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,455
They will not accept your advice,  whatever it is.

67
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:13,288
Try to tell them as far as possible,

68
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:15,288
you have to go to a great extent,

69
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,205
because you are not here for them,

70
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,580
you are here for yourself and for God.

71
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:23,080
So you have no business to waste your energy

72
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:27,497
with somebody who is a positively negative person.

73
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,789
And in that the approach should be such that

74
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:38,913
you try to help that person as far as possible.

75
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:42,996
Supposing she has some bad habits,

76
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:44,705
she's taking drugs, all right,

77
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:48,247
try to take out that part, the drug and all that,

78
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,913
try to do whatever is possible.

79
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,121
Give a bandhan, beat her with shoes

80
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,121
but your attention should not be

81
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:58,622
completely towards one person who's negative.

82
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:01,497
Normally in an ashram, I've seen,

83
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,622
mostly one negative person appears

84
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:06,497
and the whole ashram gets upset.

85
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,413
It's a very common thing

86
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:12,705
because one nasty person can spoil the whole show.

87
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:16,372
Like today I had to spend some money
with another nasty person

88
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:18,288
just for nothing at all,

89
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,080
and because she's negative

90
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,080
I had to fight it out Myself,

91
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,372
I did not know how others are going to fight it out.

92
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,497
But you have to tell frankly on the face

93
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,871
that, "If you want to go to hell you can go,

94
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,080
if you want to go to God then you should change yourself,

95
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,913
you have to transform yourself, you have to
be all right."

96
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,413
Everyone can get cured.

97
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:47,330
Lazy lumps are the only difficult things,

98
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,789
lazy people, because they have excuses.

99
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:51,539
They are the most difficult things,

100
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,622
lazy people are the most difficult people I have seen.

101
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:58,789
If the person is not a lazy person,

102
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,205
it's very easy to make him do things.

103
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:05,038
For a lazy person everything is
difficult

104
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,413
because he's indulging into laziness.

105
00:06:08,497 --> 00:06:12,038
But one must remember one principle of Sahaja Yoga

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,871
which is very important.

107
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:16,705
I think one should write it down in your heart.

108
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:21,789
This is a very important essence of Sahaja Yoga,

109
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:26,121
of how to grow, that you should know
how to raise your Kundalini.

110
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,622
You should know how to meditate

111
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:35,789
and to find out about your problems,

112
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:42,121
your defects and then remove them and raise your Kundalini.

113
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:44,913
If you cannot raise your Kundalini

114
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,413
you cannot improve in Sahaja Yoga.

115
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:52,622
Now the Kundalini falls off with many things, as you know,

116
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:53,955
if you have defects. Even supposing

117
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,871
you have a weakness for your wife,

118
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,372
you worry about her, you think about her or your husband,

119
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:01,871
who is a negative person,

120
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:03,871
the Kundalini will be sucked down.

121
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:09,789
It will be sucked down with all these negative attentions,

122
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:12,163
any kind of a negative attention you have,

123
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:13,747
it will be sucked down.

124
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:35,580
And such negative people always push forward,

125
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,580
they'll sit in front of Me,

126
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:40,288
they'll be just there to trouble Me.

127
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,330
They'll never understand that we should be at the back,

128
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,871
they are very great show-offs.

129
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,372
They will sit just in front of My eyes, I see them, just

130
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,372
I put My eyes straightforward and the person

131
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,455
is straightforward before My eyes.

132
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:52,539
Is a sign

133
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:56,247
that they are all the time trying to displease the Goddess,

134
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:58,038
all the time. Of course

135
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:00,163
your Mother is such a funny Goddess

136
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,871
that She never gets displeased.

137
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:04,455
But there so many others who get displeased.

138
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:07,747
I wish I had known that,

139
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,747
I really don't know, I think I'm nothing but forgiveness

140
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:13,330
and I just don't recognize it.

141
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:15,163
But it's a common point.

142
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:21,372
A person who is a very positive person
doesn't come forward much,

143
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:25,455
keeps out, doesn't force Me to do things.

144
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:26,913
Otherwise they'll force Me,

145
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,205
"Do this, do this, sit down like this, I'll have this.

146
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:33,580
" Unless and until I tell you, you should not.

147
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:36,664
Like I know some people, it's a headache to be with them

148
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:37,747
where they'll ask,

149
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,038
"Should I give you tea, should I bring this for you?"

150
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,163
Why? I'll tell you if I need it.

151
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:46,080
"Will you take this, will you take that,

152
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,622
would you have this,

153
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:50,622
would you like a white tea or a black tea or a yellow tea."

154
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,330
I've no time to think about all these nonsensical things.

155
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:04,539
And that's what distracts My attention from them and

156
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:08,580
they don't get -it's a vicious circle
-they don't get My blessings.

157
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,955
Linda, you are the one, now go on that side,

158
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:14,664
you know that very well and you are the one who'll sit in front.

159
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,413
Now I can tell you how many who are sitting in front of Me,

160
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:20,413
most of them would be negative people, except for Alexandra,

161
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:25,038
I can see that. Another is Martine. Is she there?

162
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,664
Martine catches very well, yes, second one must be Martine,

163
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:30,747
yes, come along. Martine catches very much.

164
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,664
And you people don't want to see that you catch,

165
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:36,871
you people don't want to see that you catch

166
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:40,580
and then what happens that it affects the other person.

167
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,539
The leaders are affected.

168
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,038
Who is next? Now who is next, let's see.

169
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,830
Behind her, she has eye trouble, she has a problem,

170
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:56,539
she should not sit in front, she should be on the side.

171
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:00,205
It's all right.

172
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,121
I need not worry that far

173
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,205
but still, let her sit on the side.

174
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,330
I've just pointed it out to you

175
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:20,705
that you can make out a negative person who has problems.

176
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,622
First of all, complaining type:

177
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,747
Anybody who is complaining of nature is negative,

178
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,330
anybody who complains is negative.

179
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,038
I never complain, do I?

180
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,830
Did I ever complain.

181
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:35,330
I've been to all your programs anywhere,  did I ever complain

182
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:37,789
that the bed is not all right?

183
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,497
Suddenly the other day I discovered the bed on I sleep

184
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:44,080
is really hard like a rock, really.

185
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:46,789
I just suddenly discovered because I sat on it.

186
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,288
But I didn't complain to anyone.

187
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,497
I said, "It's all right."

188
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:53,080
Because I'm quite comfortable Myself with it.

189
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:55,288
So this is it that shows a person

190
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,996
who's not comfortable within himself

191
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:00,996
is still negative and such a person should try to

192
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,664
keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

193
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,497
That's the best way the person is going to be helped.

194
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:07,830
For negative people also you must remember

195
00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:10,247
you must try to keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,996
Don't try to show off,

197
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,705
because such a person always wants to come forward.

198
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,372
Why? Because he'll be blessed,

199
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:19,871
because he'll be saved.

200
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:24,497
It's a kind of a, like a beggar coming to a rich man,

201
00:11:26,288 --> 00:11:27,288
but it's not so.

202
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,288
In Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

203
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:30,497
everything is just the other way round,

204
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,288
you can put everything the other way round,

205
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,913
then you'll understand.

206
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:36,705
In Sahaja Yoga those who keep

207
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,705
out of My sight are better blessed.

208
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,080
Those who do not ask Me questions,

209
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,288
whether I should have this or that are better blessed.

210
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,996
Those who do not claim anything from Me are better blessed.

211
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:57,789
Those who do not challenge Me are better blessed.

212
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,996
Miracles happen.

213
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:01,789
Like in My passport,

214
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
this has happened before also, I did not know in Australia,

215
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,705
but Mr.Srivastava told Me that My passport has expired

216
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,413
I must get the validity again sanctioned.

217
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:17,372
When I came here, Warren told Me at least three times,

218
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:19,330
then I asked Warren, "Should I go

219
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,247
to Delhi to get it done

220
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,539
because if I go to Hong Kong how will I do it,

221
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,372
without a passport?"

222
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,288
And then I said, "Let's see."

223
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,871
I opened the passport

224
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:32,288
- it's already sanctioned till eighty-eight.

225
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:46,580
So, you see, for that one has to understand

226
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:50,539
that we must know our priorities;

227
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:53,455
we must know what is important. For Me

228
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,413
it was important I have to go to Hong Kong,

229
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:58,622
I couldn't find any time when I could go there, at a time

230
00:12:58,913 --> 00:12:59,789
when it would not be very hot.

231
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:03,163
And just it worked out for Me,

232
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:07,580
I don't have to go to Delhi first and I'm now ready to go.

233
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,871
It has happened so many times

234
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:14,288
and even if something goes wrong with My passport or

235
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,913
anything because of negative forces,

236
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,539
I use it for an advantage.

237
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:22,038
So even if somebody is a negative person, use it

238
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,622
for a positive thing.

239
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:30,038
Now, example: I was going to America

240
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,622
and I had sent My passport for visa

241
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:38,205
and My husband who is so meticulous had taken it.

242
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:41,413
And they gave the visa for the last year.

243
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:43,996
When I went to the airport

244
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,996
they said, "What? This is the visa for the last year.

245
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,622
No, for the one year ahead, one year ahead they had given.

246
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:54,205
So they said, "You can go next year, not this year,

247
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:55,539
the visa is for next year."

248
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:58,205
So I telephoned to My husband,

249
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,038
it was a Sunday,

250
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,121
he just got out of bed, he ran up and down,

251
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,413
poor fellow, he said, "How is it I didn't see?"

252
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:08,497
I said, "You didn't see.

253
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,996
What has happened is that you didn't see.

254
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:12,622
The fellow who did it was quite,

255
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,913
quite speedy I think, so he gave Me one year ahead,

256
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:17,580
so now better find out."

257
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,871
I mean, this is what happens to the speedy people.

258
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,705
They'll give you visa for one year ahead.

259
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,705
That's another extreme positivity.

260
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:32,497
Now, then as a result of his running up and down,

261
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,871
they all got shattered,
you know the Americans especially felt,

262
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,871
"Oh God, what a mistake it was."

263
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,996
So they gave Me visa for five years.

264
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:51,080
So instead of feeling unhappy about the negativity

265
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,205
and making miserable faces

266
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:56,871
and making yourself miserable and Me miserable with that,

267
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:02,622
best is to laugh it out and use that negativity for your positivity.

268
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:04,871
In the beginning only

269
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,705
it happened that once we were going to Nasik,

270
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:11,497
I while going to Nasik ..?...

271
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:17,205
while going to Nasik  our car failed

272
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:18,288
and everybody said, "Mother,

273
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,205
your car never fails, how it has failed?"

274
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:23,539
I said, "Let it be, it's all right, it's very nice here,

275
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,247
I can look around, I can see around and all that."

276
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:29,372
They couldn't understand why I was so relaxed about it.

277
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:32,288
So the car failed and it took about one hour.

278
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,705
Now the people who were sahaja yogis before

279
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,205
never used to cure anybody,

280
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,247
never used to look at anyone,

281
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:41,038
never used to raise anybody's Kundalini, all very frightened.

282
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:43,705
But as I was not there,

283
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:46,497
they felt very challenged because there's such a big crowd there,

284
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:47,830
they didn't know what to do.

285
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:49,664
So they said, "All right, we'll raise your Kundalini."

286
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,038
That's how they started doing it

287
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:54,163
and it's helping now, [we were now,?]

288
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,038
that you are doing it.

289
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,580
Otherwise they would not touch it.

290
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,955
So every disadvantage,

291
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:04,580
every negativity is to be used for positivity.

292
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:09,163
As I've told you before also an example of a little cell

293
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:13,455
going inside the Mother Earth, sees a big boulder there,

294
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:17,413
goes round it, [ties?] round it again and again and again

295
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:22,121
and uses it for further holding of the tree,

296
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:23,830
for the support of the tree.

297
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,955
That is what is wisdom,

298
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
that is what is wisdom

299
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:39,455
and this wisdom comes through meditation,
meditative method.

300
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:44,580
So you must everyday meditate and raise your Kundalini,

301
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,996
otherwise you cannot grow by saying,

302
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,247
"Mother, I love you,

303
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:53,330
I love you," writing Me ten pages letters,

304
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:55,330
which is impossible to read,

305
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:58,789
doing all kinds of things like that

306
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,830
and asking Me questions morning till evening.

307
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,497
Nothing, nothing is going to help you

308
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:08,413
to understand Me or to understand yourself

309
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:09,913
or to understand Sahaja Yoga

310
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,705
or to grow in Sahaja Yoga.

311
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:14,913
You may talk, discuss, do what you like,

312
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:18,622
to understand Sahaja Yoga best is to keep very happy.

313
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,705
Happy faces, happiness within yourself,

314
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:24,996
joy within yourself,

315
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,330
try to see the essence of joy in everything,

316
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:31,205
don't try to criticize, make yourself miserable.

317
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:36,121
But to raise your Kundalini

318
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,913
every morning religiously,

319
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:42,413
every morning, every night raise your Kundalini.

320
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:47,247
Kundalini is like the nourishment, the nourishment,

321
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:53,913
the water of life for the growth of your inner being.

322
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,038
If you do not meditate,

323
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,330
if you do not know how to raise your Kundalini,

324
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:00,121
you better try to learn it.

325
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,038
Negative people always avoid that

326
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,830
because then they feel burnings,

327
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:07,497
they feel this. Face it up for a while,

328
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:10,622
doesn't matter, face it up, clear out yourself

329
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:13,539
and see that you raise your own Kundalini.

330
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:16,539
Don't blame your husband, don't blame your wife,

331
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:19,205
don't blame your children, don't blame your atmosphere,

332
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,705
nothing of the kind. You can go in the jungles everyday,

333
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:23,871
you can go anywhere you want to,

334
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,580
if you want to do it, you can do it.

335
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,247
But people must understand that now we are saints,

336
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:31,622
and saints have to do that.

337
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,996
You'll be surprised if you start meditating,

338
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,705
most of your problems will disappear

339
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:44,705
because all physical problems will be looked after by God.

340
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,330
All material problems will be looked after.

341
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:50,913
All other problems, family problems will be looked after.

342
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:56,121
But the main problem is how to make you do it.

343
00:18:56,413 --> 00:19:02,497
It's like once you eat your food
your tongue can taste it,

344
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:05,622
it gets the saliva, it goes down,

345
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:06,913
it's all looked after,

346
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:09,497
it goes down properly, down below it is all

347
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,789
the juices are secreted,

348
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:13,996
they know that the food is coming,

349
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:18,497
it is digested in different parts, as it is, it is all built-in.

350
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:20,580
But you must put it in the mouth,

351
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,372
and this is what is the mechanism of Sahaja Yoga is

352
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:33,080
that you must meditate and raise your Kundalini.

353
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:36,871
In so many ways, in so many styles, in so many angles

354
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:39,996
I have said this again and again and again and again.

355
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:43,871
But that's what we do not do.

356
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:48,372
And know your purpose, you must know your purpose.

357
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:49,705
Like as I said

358
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:52,913
that  the leaders do not know their importance at all.

359
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,205
They behave sometimes in a manner which I can't understand.

360
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:02,205
They become so silly about their wives, their husbands

361
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:03,622
that I cannot understand.

362
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:06,205
That's not important at all.

363
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,121
If they're leaders, they have responsibility.

364
00:20:09,955 --> 00:20:12,955
Secondly, the leaders must tell off

365
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,580
people who are to be told off,

366
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:15,871
it's very important.

367
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,205
If you cannot tell off people, it's no use.

368
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:31,372
And that's how the leadership is not going to be respected,

369
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:34,580
if you do not tell off people who are negative.

370
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:38,413
One negative problem comes in, immediately they'll report it,

371
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,038
I immediately know this is his wife

372
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,830
or husband must be doing nonsense there.

373
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,913
Immediately it is reported,

374
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:45,705
"This is happening, that is happening,"

375
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,705
is a sign of negativity.

376
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:53,580
Immediately you can solve the problem, give bandhans.

377
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:00,580
The simplest way is to sit before My photograph

378
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:03,205
and just say, "Mother, please this is the problem," finished.

379
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,455
There's no need to take a telephone and

380
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:09,163
telephone to Me at about two o'clock in the night.

381
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:14,871
Just do that, but the trouble is you cannot

382
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:18,080
because your system is not yet reached that point.

383
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:20,497
It's such a vicious circle.

384
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:23,288
Your system must reach that point

385
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,705
where the connection is absolutely there,

386
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:27,996
you don't care for leadership, anything,

387
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,539
but you care for your inner growth.

388
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,121
If your inner growth is in that position

389
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,705
it will happen automatically.

390
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,789
This is what it is, very difficult

391
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:48,413
for people to understand that we have to be

392
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,497
sensibly placed towards ourselves.

393
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:56,497
Now about the leaders I would say this about others also,

394
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:01,705
that we have to be very, very sensibly

395
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:03,622
placed about ourselves.

396
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,580
Are we sensible towards ourselves?

397
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:09,288
Some old people behave like children,

398
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,955
some children behave like old people in the

399
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:15,747
sense that start telling off, answering back, misbehaving.

400
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,580
We must know our age, our group,

401
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,247
everything and behave in a manner that is dignified.

402
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,247
In a small age also if a child talks like a child,

403
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,205
he can be very, very positive.

404
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:37,996
I must tell you that I've had some very, very funny reports

405
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:40,580
about some people which was so shocking

406
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:43,705
that how did they arbitrarily behaved.

407
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:49,288
And it's only thing that is behind is the sense of leadership.

408
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,580
I wanted to be leaders, this wanted to be leaders,

409
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,580
that wanted to be leaders.

410
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,288
There's nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga,

411
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:59,789
you don't know your Mother is too capable.

412
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,789
She doesn't need any leaders, you don't know Her,

413
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,205
better know Her. She's too capable,

414
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:10,455
very clever and cunning woman.

415
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:22,247
She's all-powerful

416
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,664
and She knows everything about you,

417
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,830
She knows how to handle situations.

418
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,455
She's not going to allow Sahaja Yoga

419
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:32,747
disappear because of somebody's stupidity.

420
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:33,747
Know that!

421
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,747
Sitting down here I know about everything about everyone.

422
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,413
I may look very simple, it's not so.

423
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:52,038
That's why I have to tell you

424
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:55,205
that you don't consider yourself

425
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:04,622
to be endowed with some sort of a special power as a leader.

426
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:11,205
Only that you have the power through your Mother

427
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:12,996
which you have to assert.

428
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:15,789
So, "Whatever I'm doing is the Mother Who is doing it."

429
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,996
And when you do that you'll be amazed

430
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:21,372
that  whatever you want  will be sensible,

431
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:24,372
whatever you'll ask for it will be sensible

432
00:24:24,705 --> 00:24:27,497
- sensible means which is related to Sahaja Yoga.

433
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:31,789
And whatever you do will be sensible.

434
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:35,747
All your dignity, everything will pile up together,

435
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,871
but foremost thing and the most important at

436
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:42,539
any cost you must meditate.

437
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,497
This is what I have to now tell to our Indians also

438
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:55,080
but for you it is very important

439
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:59,205
because now you are returning back to

440
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:01,871
"the real place."

441
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:10,080
Like yesterday somebody said to Me,  some westerner said,

442
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:12,996
"Mother they are talking about why you left Vaikuntha

443
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:15,580
and came to this India,

444
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:18,913
is all right, but we would say why did you leave this India

445
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:20,205
and came to us."

446
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,705
Then the answer was there that the God

447
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:30,497
God has become mad about the saints

448
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:31,955
because of the saints

449
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,455
and their company.

450
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:36,622
But the saints have to be saints

451
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:38,622
otherwise they become troublesome to Me.

452
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:44,121
If I go to lunatic asylum

453
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:45,539
nothing will happen to Me.

454
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:51,539
If I go to say, to a cemetery, nothing will happen to Me.

455
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:56,789
But if a saint catches even a slightest thing,

456
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:58,913
that troubles Me, tortures Me,

457
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:01,121
not outwardly may be, but inside.

458
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:09,413
Because I've given you place in My heart,

459
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:12,497
in My being, you circulate in My being.

460
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,913
That is how I know about you.

461
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:20,705
So if you really grow better,

462
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,413
if you improve better

463
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:26,121
it will be a thing of joy for you

464
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,372
and the greatest joy for Me as well,

465
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:30,580
that's all I want that you should be,

466
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:33,497
nothing else, nothing else.

467
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,789
Now one more assurance I want to give you

468
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:44,205
that we are going to start certain projects in India.

469
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,330
Now the time has come,

470
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:49,413
we have acquired some land definitely now

471
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:51,747
and we are going to work out

472
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:54,955
some projects as soon as I settle down in India,

473
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,038
we will start showing the manifestation of that.

474
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,038
And maybe this kind of tour

475
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,830
I may not be able to do after a few years.

476
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:09,747
But then you yourself will be able to conduct  these

477
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,247
tours in your own country, go round

478
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,413
because this is a training period where you will learn how

479
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:17,121
to do this kind of thing.

480
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:20,413
Of course in your country it's rather difficult to get such people

481
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:24,038
but how to contact: I started with one person.

482
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,121
So I'm just a lady, housewife

483
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,747
and if I could do it, why not you?

484
00:27:42,455 --> 00:27:47,288
So now go with a pleasant mind, enjoy yourself.

485
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:52,288
It's very difficult for a mother to bear all this because

486
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,996
when I leave India I feel terrible about the Indians,

487
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:57,038
when I leave youI feel terrible about you.

488
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,247
It's something horrible

489
00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:01,121
that I want that somehow or other we all should have one

490
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,330
huge country of our own where we all settle down happily together.

491
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:22,622
So on behalf of you I would like to thank all the Indians

492
00:28:22,955 --> 00:28:25,455
who have done so much for us,

493
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,789
given us all the comfort, according to them it was discomfort

494
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,705
but according to you it was comfort.

495
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:52,413
Now you are going on this tour,

496
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:53,622
I would request you not to discuss

497
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:58,622
other mundane nonsensical things on the way but

498
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,871
discuss Sahaja Yoga. Understand,

499
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:03,789
there are people who are just new, tell them  about Sahaj Yog,

500
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,038
let them know what is Sahaja Yoga is,

501
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,789
also explain to them what is Sahaja Yoga.

502
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,622
You'll be travelling now quite a lot

503
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:15,247
and also you'll be going to places where

504
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,038
we are going to have our projects done.

505
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,288
You can have a look at it, will be a good idea

506
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,580
and also you think about what kind of projects

507
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:26,789
we can have in this country

508
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,664
which will help them to achieve better results in Sahaja Yoga.

509
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,955
All these we have to discuss

510
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:39,955
and this group is much more serious-type,

511
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:43,038
I think, and it's going to work out something seriously.

512
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:48,288
About the future plans that we would like to have

513
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,497
here and abroad and whatever are the dates and

514
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:56,038
things you would like to do. In the month of May, June, July

515
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:58,747
I would be in the West and

516
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,580
May  I would like to keep for America,

517
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:04,580
if possible, at least the second half of May.

518
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:07,539
The rest of it you can adjust it the way you want to have

519
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:10,955
and also arrange your programs among yourselves

520
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:13,163
whichever way you say is all right.

521
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:16,399
This time it was desired that I should go to Greece,

522
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:19,867
I don't mind, I would like to go there and do the needful.

523
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,247
I hope all the leaders have got the [chains?]

524
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:37,455
I have given to Warren.

525
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:40,672
All right, it's done now.

526
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,580
I worry about all little, little things like that.

527
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:49,780
..............................Marathi............................

528
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:56,258
Now you're all here together.

529
00:30:56,595 --> 00:31:01,023
And you mixed with them.
They served so much.

530
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:06,662
Saints served. All of us
are very grateful to you.

531
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:19,102
You worked very hard. we just doesn't
understand how much to thank for that.

532
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:23,105
But for you, these people have
Bring some photos and other stuff.

533
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,359
We will give it to everyone after worship.

534
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:28,012
Secondly,

535
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:34,912
The songs that were sung or dance
was done in the program yesterday.

536
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,104
That makes these people are very happy.

537
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:42,855
Mataji, thank them in the
Marathi language on our behalf.

538
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:45,356
They have said that.

539
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,505
Especially the university
people have done

540
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,629
such a beautiful program
with such hard work.

541
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,107
They really appreciated that.

542
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:03,108
The other thing is that

543
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:08,104
people and the men of the
university should think of contributing

544
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:10,608
a little to my work.

545
00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:18,756
You know that we went to different
places. we went to Ashtangaon,

546
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,601
we went to Ganori village.

547
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:23,872
We went to Sangamner and

548
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:28,982
many people came to Shrirampur too.

549
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:35,105
In this place, you people
should divide each other.

550
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:37,356
Dhumal work very hard.

551
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:41,103
He worked so hard to maintain Sahajyoga.

552
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:48,104
This single man took everything
on himself and Spend money for

553
00:32:48,354 --> 00:32:50,356
the Sahaja yoga. Wisely did it all.

554
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:57,602
Also, everyone should
take on his responsibilities.

555
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,354
Because it is the work of the Lord.

556
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:04,605
Who had the opportunity to get the
power of the Lord and the work of the Lord

557
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:06,443
So without any

558
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:12,912
greed for domination or power or money.

559
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:19,857
We must do this work
in the greed of the Lord.

560
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:25,602
And make all arrangements within
you. Which village will we go to?

561
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:27,355
Who will go to which village?

562
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:29,672
make all the arrangements.
took a share of each work.

563
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:35,857
Now, Mr. Kumbhojkar is here,
I tell him, he should look here.

564
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:37,662
and pay attention to everyone.

565
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:45,563
Everyone should be given
different places, locations.

566
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:51,605
And before that, we went to
Aardgaon, went to Musalwadi,

567
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:54,992
And we have gone to so many places.

568
00:33:54,992 --> 00:34:01,354
Where is Renuka Devi
situated? "Manori". We went there.

569
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:05,232
We have been to many places like this.

570
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,107
The main work is already done.

571
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:12,606
But still, there is no
consistency, integrity in this work.

572
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:14,607
That you guys can do it .

573
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,972
One day a week, take time out to set
up your center. Whatever you want to run.

574
00:34:18,972 --> 00:34:22,856
Wherever you are convinced.
You can take it and go there.

575
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,604
Ladies should go there
and sing a few songs there.

576
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,312
Call people. Because of the
hymns(bhajan) lots of people will come.

577
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:31,732
If women go and say hymns
(bhajan), many people will be attracted.

578
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:33,604
There is a program of
hymns (bhajan). You come

579
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:39,859
Even if you go once a week, it
will be like doing a lot of work.

580
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:42,356
Different tasks should be
divided among yourselves.

581
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:45,106
There are two parts to Sahaja yoga.

582
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:48,194
first, you should raise
your kundalini from Inside.

583
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,855
Kundalini should be picked up.

584
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:51,853
Meditation should be done for this.

585
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:53,357
But what to do with a lamp?

586
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:57,355
If you put a lamp and put it in
the distance, what is the benefit?

587
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:01,604
Christ has clearly said that no one lights
a lamp and puts it down in Lighthouse.

588
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:04,552
So they put it on top.
they do not keep it down.

589
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:09,102
And it is a lamp that light up
by the Lord has given to you.

590
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:12,102
You should give light to others.

591
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:18,104
And only when you enlighten
others, you will find true happiness.

592
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:20,606
And that is a circle of joy.

593
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:25,106
Now if I had explained to you in the
example as nature, you would remember.

594
00:35:25,352 --> 00:35:27,358
There is a circle in Nature.

595
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,609
Suppose you now sow a seed.

596
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:31,854
Now that your farm is ready.

597
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:38,927
Then the leaves of the tree falls.

598
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:42,354
Why it Because it contains nitrogen.

599
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:45,856
That nitrogen must go back into the cosmos.

600
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:50,359
Well, why did the leaves
of the tree fall back again?

601
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:55,032
Because in winter the sunlight
is less. that's why they fall.

602
00:35:55,872 --> 00:36:01,103
And after the leaves fall, the
sun also warms the earth well.

603
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:06,944
Next to these are the lands
that are decomposed by

604
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:11,377
nitrogen of fallen leaves.
They regain fertility.

605
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,852
They get Fertile. so you
Can cultivate well in him.

606
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:25,105
Same in Sahajayoga, you
have stored energy in yourself.

607
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:29,108
And increased your power.
Now there is power in you.

608
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:33,107
that power makes you better person.

609
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:37,857
Your habits are gone. You
have become your own captain.

610
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:45,832
After that, if we give it to others
then what we have given, we get back.

611
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:51,853
As the clouds rise from the sea and
go up to the sky, why they work so hard?

612
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,103
So they give water to the whole world.

613
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:58,354
And then they are transported
back to the sea by the river.

614
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:04,356
It is so. Whatever you give to
others, you will get it back just as good.

615
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:09,355
And the joy of it, to see it.
that view, is your personality.

616
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:11,857
Your personality is seen in what you do.

617
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:13,354
What have you done?

618
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:16,851
How do you see it?
It's like a mirror of yours.

619
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:21,356
It is the mirror of your life.
That shows what you did outside.

620
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:24,105
But the key is wisdom.

621
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:25,853
I am somewhat polite.

622
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:31,606
I can do something irritating. I can say
anything. Or I have an Eloquent speech on

623
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:38,356
something special. Or I have a lot of
wisdom. Or I'm having something too much.

624
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,858
I'm an artist. There is nothing

625
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,603
will happen if you
have thought like this.

626
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:44,607
I'm just a Sahaja yogi. I
doing work for the lord.

627
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:46,360
I have no time to do other things.

628
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:48,358
I just doing work for the lord.

629
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:50,609
This is the work of
the Lord that I'm doing.

630
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:52,103
That is the most important Work.

631
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,853
Beyond that, nothing matters.

632
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:57,359
If you decide to stay in this
Thought. And with that understanding,

633
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,856
you try to make a picture
of yourself! It must be good.

634
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,101
There will be no flaws.

635
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:03,854
Keep looking at yourself.

636
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:06,606
What do we see in the mirror?
That our body is clean or not.

637
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:10,105
just like that always look
yourself. to see everything is fine.

638
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,643
Have we done any mistakes?

639
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:14,608
Have we done some selfishness?

640
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,852
Have we done something wrong?

641
00:38:16,852 --> 00:38:20,605
We can't get Sahaja yoga.
if we have double standards.

642
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:41,103
Then must-have some courage.

643
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:43,862
Must work a little harder.

644
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:49,105
And it should be noted that
no one has such a privilege.

645
00:38:50,104 --> 00:38:55,358
Do the Lord's work, gain
the power of the Lord,

646
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:59,222
and live happily in the
kingdom of the Lord.

647
00:38:59,222 --> 00:39:01,107
Never found all three things like that.

648
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:05,106
People ask three things to the Lord.

649
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:15,609
Samipya , that is, to be close to you.

650
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:21,105
Saalokya, that is, you see.

651
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,856
and Sanidhya you should be with me.

652
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:35,605
Since we arrived you found all these three.

653
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,356
Happen automatically.

654
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:40,358
But we have given you the fourth thing.

655
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:44,854
We have given you a
very important fourth thing.

656
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:48,854
That is Tadatmya.

657
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,855
We have put you in our hearts.

658
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:55,947
Some Sahaja yogis are so
good, that even if their thoughts

659
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:58,893
come up, I feel like I am
swimming in the ocean of happiness.

660
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:05,608
And there are some Sahaja yogis.
that I Don't want to think about them.

661
00:40:09,002 --> 00:40:12,252
So all four of these things
you got in Sahaja yoga.

662
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:15,103
Which not everyone has got.

663
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:21,358
Someone got Saalokya, Someone
got Samipya, Someone got Sanidhya.

664
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,102
But very few people have
tadatmya.and those who have tadatmya,

665
00:40:27,102 --> 00:40:29,106
not got the first three things.

666
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:31,853
Just got tadatmya.

667
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:34,610
They never saw the Lord.

668
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:39,104
They Never came close to the
lord. or Lord never with them.

669
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,772
Only they had getting
everything in Tadatmya.

670
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:45,531
But now after you've got it all,

671
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:49,605
You have to improve a lot.

672
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:53,212
But the thing with them, they had been

673
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:55,763
searching for the Lord
for thousands of years.

674
00:40:56,107 --> 00:41:01,609
There is Sukrit and also Your virtue
must be there. Without it, it would not be.

675
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:04,858
But in this birth, we should be virtuous.

676
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:12,110
It is true that we are troubled by the
karma that we did in our previous lives.

677
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:17,106
If we had behaved well in the previous
lives, we would not have suffered so much.

678
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:19,579
But now if I do more
foolishness in this birth,

679
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:21,606
then what is going to
happen in the next life

680
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:24,205
even after giving so much
power by Aadishakti,

681
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,858
I do not see the picture of
what is going to happen

682
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:29,103
in the next life. I don't see

683
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:30,922
the picture. Because it is so fragile.

684
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:31,922
What will happen?

685
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:35,572
Because it never happened.The
Lord never gave that much.

686
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:39,095
No one has ever gotten that
much. Even if you behave like

687
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,066
this way, I don't understand the
picture of what will happen.

688
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:44,104
I can't remember this.

689
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:48,605
how to look? Because it never happened.

690
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:57,609
And so it is very much needed.

691
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:02,106
You have to see clearly
and lean in Sahaja yoga.

692
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,083
Especially the ego veil.

693
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:07,955
These people are more educated,

694
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:12,497
more wealthy, dutiful than you are.

695
00:42:14,353 --> 00:42:16,165
They understand,

696
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:21,602
but you don't, because intellect
There is no intensity. No accuracy.

697
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,881
Must have pure intelligence.
Wisdom must be pure.

698
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:26,022
Why does intelligence go upside down?
because she is

699
00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:27,523
not clean.Want of pure wisdom.

700
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:32,599
Once you get down to pure wisdom
you will notice, why do I do this?

701
00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:34,154
Why do I not think so?

702
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:36,732
Why am I not okay?

703
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:40,331
It will feel like that and then you
will immediately have that power.

704
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:45,413
And you better yourself.

705
00:42:47,718 --> 00:42:51,145
There are many rules of Sahaja
yoga. They are very simple. Nothing

706
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,750
difficult. You don't have to do
anything special. You must obey them.

707
00:42:54,953 --> 00:43:01,186
But most importantly, what we call
passion, the persistence behind anything.

708
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:06,499
But in a word of perseverance,
it seems like a little trouble.

709
00:43:06,702 --> 00:43:09,992
But the word Lagna is so
beautiful that it has begun.

710
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:15,774
So we need to keep clean.

711
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:17,472
You should meditate daily.

712
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:20,520
When we meditated today,
what did we give to others?

713
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,102
The Lord gave this fruit of
happiness, what did we give to another?

714
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:25,648
That should be considered.

715
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:31,690
Great monks and saints, no one was rich.

716
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:36,338
Only their avatar is big, but nothing else.

717
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:39,043
Monks and saints did not have a big money.

718
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:42,322
But everyone has made a lot of donations

719
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:46,043
and they haven't asked
for anything from God.

720
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:48,736
Also you should.

721
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:52,779
A little hard work for body, a
little trouble, something happened.

722
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:56,662
What's the matter? We are doing God's work.
People have suffered a lot for God's work?

723
00:43:57,947 --> 00:44:00,999
and you know all, you understand
everything. but still, if you do

724
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:03,975
not do this, I do not understand
what is going to happen with you.

725
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:06,350
I can't even imagine what will happen.

726
00:44:06,354 --> 00:44:09,109
I mean it looks like
it's going to be terrible.

727
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:12,026
So please keep this in mind,

728
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:15,853
Meditation-retention is
something to do daily, get the kids

729
00:44:15,878 --> 00:44:19,318
to do it, and make
self-improvement and stay in the path.

730
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:24,169
In Sahaja yoga, we do not consider
caste, religion as any distinction.

731
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:27,694
Therefore, no religion,
caste or religion is allowed.

732
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:30,803
If you give in, that's the
wrong thing. Not at all.

733
00:44:31,022 --> 00:44:34,001
Okay now. If you want your daughter
to get married in your caste do it

734
00:44:34,026 --> 00:44:37,243
but if marriage not happened in
your cast you can do it in another cast.

735
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:41,947
Your caste is not external but your
thoughts on it should be broadened.

736
00:44:42,006 --> 00:44:45,231
We have fallen in love with the world.
We have come into the world religion.

737
00:44:45,231 --> 00:44:50,864
If our thoughts are not so powerful,
then no human being can do Sahaja yoga.

738
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:55,115
How many years ago Agarkar,
Tilak had proposed this idea before us.

739
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,050
But today this is going
to happen in Sahaja yoga.

740
00:45:00,843 --> 00:45:06,647
We can fix all the social things in
our country, political things as well as

741
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:10,341
our financial things. If your
thoughts become overwhelming.

742
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:11,841
So we are really great.

743
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:16,518
Look at the kids,

744
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,747
Discipline children.

745
00:45:21,148 --> 00:45:24,823
Should look at the discipline of the
child. How not to behave, how to act.

746
00:45:40,396 --> 00:45:41,605
Yet they did not come.

747
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:48,604
I have told you a hundred times
that you should not wait for your wife.

748
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:55,857
And you are the leader and the leader
must understand the importance of himself.

749
00:45:58,904 --> 00:46:00,591
Everyone should take lessons.

750
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:32,903
Come on. We are tired of waiting for you.

751
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,175
and bakare why didn't you
come early? What is your

752
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,524
significance? There will be
You have waited for your wife.

753
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:40,121
Both of you should come early.

754
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:42,523
Shivlekar told you to come
soon. So why don't you come?

755
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:49,439
the wife can come later.

756
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:54,017
I do not mean to torture
or harass your wife.

757
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,189
But wherever needed, you have
to come. do work at work hours.

758
00:47:03,222 --> 00:47:05,328
The wife should understand,

759
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:09,265
But these wives are very wrong. they
argue with the husband in everything.

760
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:11,312
The wife from here is wrong.

761
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,953
This is due to the severity. You may be

762
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:17,039
surprised, I never call
my husband in the office.

763
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,355
I Never used his car.

764
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,178
I never tell his secretary to do any job.

765
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:24,756
This is the record so far.

766
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:29,342
You ask him.

767
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:37,359
Once we just went to Australia
and I wanted to go to Germany,

768
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:39,993
Who is the ambassador
there? That's what I asked.

769
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:42,583
And said, 'Do you know him?'

770
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:47,104
I called him for this. So he
climbed the steps and came up.

771
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,973
Didn't even take the escalator.

772
00:47:49,052 --> 00:47:52,302
For five minutes they were saying,
'Are you all right? What happened to you?

773
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,702
Did the accident happen? I said, ' just
listen. I'm fine'

774
00:47:54,702 --> 00:47:57,125
Because I don't call him.
They know I will not call even

775
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,659
if I die. that's why he thought
there must be some reason.

776
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,572
As ever, no matter what.

777
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:05,796
When they go out they ask
me What do I bring for you?

778
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:08,828
I Said, 'Nothing. just Come straight home.'

779
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:09,922
I don't want anything.

780
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:14,296
Always help with their work.
and anytime you ask him

781
00:48:14,594 --> 00:48:18,703
I never complain about a single penny.

782
00:48:20,078 --> 00:48:22,801
That's how marriage life runs.

783
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,393
Always kept on crying.
this is mine and all.

784
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:30,439
Why not this woman come alone?
Who is going to kidnap the them?

785
00:48:38,145 --> 00:48:40,681
Women force a lot.

786
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:44,291
Now it has started in
Maharashtra. I can see.

787
00:48:45,072 --> 00:48:46,905
There is nothing lacking in coercion.

788
00:48:46,984 --> 00:48:49,233
They are scared of everything else.

789
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,358
But they will do whatever they want.

790
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:53,546
Very scared from above.

791
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,280
You scare yourself. The rest
of the world is scared of you.

792
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,641
Never Dominate your husband.

793
00:49:04,105 --> 00:49:06,301
this is not allowed in Sahaja yoga.

794
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:10,102
The woman has her own
place, the man has his own place.

795
00:49:10,102 --> 00:49:14,813
Rama left Sita, Sita left
Rama, but in his own way.

796
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:17,235
She left him.

797
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:19,923
But she left him in her own way.

798
00:49:20,517 --> 00:49:23,329
Not left him in the forest,
but left him in the world

799
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:31,359
You don't know your method yet.

800
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,124
What is the Method of
power, it must be learned.

801
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,140
It is not at all tempting to
force a husband to just show up.

802
00:49:42,203 --> 00:49:44,192
That's what I tell girls these days.

803
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:46,592
That means there will be no speech again.

804
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:50,327
Tell your daughters, too,
don't dominate your husband.

805
00:49:50,683 --> 00:49:51,796
Should be respected.

806
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:55,171
There is a very special way
to make fun of your husband.

807
00:49:55,265 --> 00:49:58,733
But she does not want to honor
her husband. So that's pretty bad.

808
00:50:03,593 --> 00:50:08,218
From a husband, you get power in your home.

809
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:09,624
Power comes.

810
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:13,827
There is prime minister and
there is a deputy minister.

811
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:17,952
if deputy minister try to talk in front
of prime minister. that's not good look.

812
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:20,171
It happened once.

813
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:22,915
Tells you now because it's time.

814
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:25,144
Once I was in London. That time Mr. Bajpai

815
00:50:25,364 --> 00:50:28,801
is Foreign Minister. I don't
know who is Mr. Bajpai.

816
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:34,613
They (prime minister) invited
us to dinner, so we went.

817
00:50:35,254 --> 00:50:37,921
Mr.Morarji Bhai was your prime minister.

818
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,998
He said that don't give alcohol to anybody

819
00:50:41,315 --> 00:50:43,814
These people are addicted to
alcohol and must be given alcohol.

820
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,533
I don't know he is the Foreign Minister.

821
00:50:46,784 --> 00:50:52,622
I said, "Well, you should
give them alcohol, etc. Well,

822
00:50:52,622 --> 00:50:54,473
but do they do anything?
If they come to our

823
00:50:54,498 --> 00:50:56,493
country, do they sit on
the plate and eat dinner?"

824
00:50:56,909 --> 00:50:59,782
Why did we act like slavery?

825
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:06,985
I don't know he is a foreign
minister. saheb stopped me.

826
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:14,476
There is your prime minister.

827
00:51:14,501 --> 00:51:16,116
Who are you to talk like that?

828
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:19,750
If your Prime Minister says
so, you should stand with them.

829
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:22,812
Why are you stick your nose in this ?

830
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:26,343
Even if you are the Foreign
Minister. this same goes to the wife.

831
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:30,547
Adornment comes from there.
don't behave Inauspiciously.

832
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:37,942
There are many experiences.

833
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:41,049
I'm very surprised.

834
00:51:44,553 --> 00:51:48,990
And there will be ghosts like this. Women
who behave this way will be demonized.

835
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:53,178
Ghosts will not go away if
the husband is not honored.

836
00:51:56,428 --> 00:52:01,089
Well, now we came here
for worship, let's sit down.
