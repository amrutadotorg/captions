WEBVTT

00:07.330 --> 00:13.349
Now you've got a coupon in Brighton also I was amazed how did you manage that

00:16.150 --> 00:18.150
Brighton show

00:22.460 --> 00:27.430
These are the Couture Easter sent you from India this ones I

00:29.029 --> 00:31.029
Bought them here

00:32.210 --> 00:35.590
But they had given them some plates item yeah

00:38.059 --> 00:40.059
Hello

00:41.839 --> 00:43.839
How are you

01:00.510 --> 01:02.510
Jenna

01:07.350 --> 01:09.350
Sit up

01:16.979 --> 01:18.979
Now get me some water

01:33.660 --> 01:36.139
What is this I'm not going to lecture not

01:46.860 --> 01:49.010
Come just to consult about this

01:57.990 --> 01:59.990
Journalism I

02:01.200 --> 02:03.260
Think granny should come here and

02:04.530 --> 02:07.699
Let's see. What is the agenda? How are we going to work it out?

02:23.600 --> 02:28.509
Now which I say now, how are we going to work now to help what should we do?

02:31.580 --> 02:38.380
First my solutions have you there you give me your solution about opportunity difference?

02:40.040 --> 02:44.949
That we should have a formal body formal

02:47.450 --> 02:51.759
People who will deal with the journalistic side

02:55.640 --> 02:57.640
Call it by a name

03:01.400 --> 03:07.000
They are calling in America have given they were named Golden Age international

03:18.270 --> 03:24.199
So you have a formal body then you must have for that a proper

03:27.060 --> 03:29.060
Card system

03:33.040 --> 03:37.920
And a kind of appeal or something letter of introduction

03:54.180 --> 03:59.209
It's a very crew starts work very such a work of Shri, Krishna

04:00.810 --> 04:03.680
Nothing we have to have very clever people in this

04:09.630 --> 04:11.630
Other mysterious

04:14.520 --> 04:16.969
Too much honesty so-called

04:20.070 --> 04:22.070
Which is all dishonest world

04:23.430 --> 04:25.430
Will not take us to higher goals

04:27.000 --> 04:31.489
So to go to higher goals, you have to sacrifice it you know who it's like to see

04:39.270 --> 04:44.000
That we should have only the name of sahaja yoga and we should come out of sahaja Yogi's

04:44.970 --> 04:47.089
We may land up in jail if you start that

04:50.190 --> 04:52.190
So come at something else

04:54.960 --> 05:00.019
You know have a form well with a proper

05:02.430 --> 05:08.329
Message that we are here to contact all the people who have alternatives

05:11.310 --> 05:13.310
To create the Golden Age

05:15.479 --> 05:17.479
On one side

05:18.690 --> 05:20.690
We will have a

05:21.840 --> 05:23.840
We will have a

05:24.389 --> 05:29.029
Face by which people will think you are all neutral people

05:30.300 --> 05:32.419
And you can have approved to them directly

05:34.349 --> 05:36.349
And on the other side was I

05:42.150 --> 05:48.829
That will do you looking very pale must not look fucking very hard

05:51.330 --> 05:54.529
If it is you now you better give us some rest now

05:58.289 --> 06:00.679
Now after having that phone

06:01.889 --> 06:08.119
And one side you will have a face by week. You can meet people you can reach them easily

06:09.449 --> 06:15.559
You cannot you will have your own cards send them the cards you are International Golden Age people

06:16.259 --> 06:17.759
responsible

06:17.759 --> 06:20.689
Wear a formal dress don't go like hippies

06:25.590 --> 06:28.819
Because we have tried straightforwardly that's it

06:31.029 --> 06:35.499
I will have to save the world. That's our job. That's the real hardwood you have to achieve

06:36.769 --> 06:40.449
By hook or crook you have to serve them whether they'll be all finished

06:41.659 --> 06:44.558
You can't take them out out of the water

06:45.679 --> 06:48.729
By pulling with your hand put a hoop around them and bring them out

06:51.739 --> 06:57.639
Useless blind nonsensical people. They don't want to see the fun what to do

06:59.299 --> 07:00.769
All right

07:00.769 --> 07:08.199
So one side will have a face another side. You will be always in touch of others who are trying to form the alternative

07:10.519 --> 07:13.059
Other gurus either false people other

07:19.340 --> 07:21.849
So very cleverly bring them down to surgery

07:25.310 --> 07:27.310
It's a fifth columnist

07:31.310 --> 07:35.709
You have to enter into them and tell them ultimately this is no good

07:39.530 --> 07:41.530
Exposing all of them

07:42.770 --> 07:44.770
One by one

07:46.160 --> 07:49.689
Because you will be a body a form of a body that

07:51.530 --> 07:54.699
Nobody cannot ask for your bona fide e

07:56.480 --> 08:01.780
When you enter into these alternatives you can just see the point and say this is this

08:05.990 --> 08:08.259
We did that branded that in our street

08:09.110 --> 08:11.349
even they brought in sahaja yoga into some

08:11.900 --> 08:18.280
Problem a little bit and then it was they asked for forgiveness and the whole joke for nowt and the people didn't understand

08:18.280 --> 08:21.249
That's how brought sahaja yoga to a Greek level. Is it a black?

08:22.070 --> 08:24.070
To the big drama they played

08:25.790 --> 08:27.110
And

08:27.110 --> 08:32.559
Actually Terrence wrote against them that these people came to sahaja yoga this thing and how are they blaming us?

08:32.960 --> 08:39.910
Personally that and then it was the base EC drama and then it was said later on that. No, nothing like Sergio you say

08:40.640 --> 08:42.640
Something like that. You have to play

08:42.980 --> 08:47.050
No, simple methods are going to work with his cunning people

08:48.440 --> 08:50.440
extremely cunning

08:51.410 --> 08:54.399
Journalists here are very cunning people to Millican

08:58.940 --> 09:03.580
So now when you are away immediately become formal you can

09:04.640 --> 09:09.249
Find out all the newspapers all the ready terms and go to see them

09:10.400 --> 09:11.840
must have

09:11.840 --> 09:13.730
black suits

09:13.730 --> 09:15.730
yards

09:17.390 --> 09:19.390
With white lines

09:22.670 --> 09:25.240
And with with oil in the head

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
He's a pure English

09:34.460 --> 09:36.460
that cement I

09:36.830 --> 09:40.869
Mean little mix blood may be. All right, but not too much

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
but don't take a

09:44.120 --> 09:49.239
person who is from Scotland to an English editor, so there are basic by

09:50.540 --> 09:52.540
Differences the bias is there

09:53.210 --> 09:57.340
So better takers got more squat one to Cottle

09:58.280 --> 10:00.429
Write and speak with a little accent

10:04.590 --> 10:06.590
We have stupid people

10:12.350 --> 10:19.300
All this is done imagine on we should be can you patent this is the job off we should be so many style cities

10:19.300 --> 10:25.719
It's not only that you have to speak about it that it has to go all over who these medias are nothing

10:25.720 --> 10:30.309
But you should be because I have to be witness and they have to manifest it in

10:31.670 --> 10:35.920
Enlargement, they are supposed to be they are placed there for this region

10:37.040 --> 10:39.249
so if they don't do it better you

10:40.339 --> 10:42.339
the other side of it

10:42.499 --> 10:44.499
Before them and use them

10:46.459 --> 10:51.909
Because they are there only for this purpose why God has created them and put them in this position just think of it

10:52.069 --> 10:56.019
How did they get these medias why God has given them just think of it

10:58.939 --> 11:02.529
They are doing all kinds of nonsensical things they are wasting everybody's energy

11:04.999 --> 11:11.859
Into all useless enterprises they don't want to do God's work. So you better be fooled up and make them

11:14.269 --> 11:18.849
That's what they deserve why God has given them all these powers

11:20.420 --> 11:27.189
They haven't achieved anything of their own and they state even a leaf even that they cannot create on their own

11:28.249 --> 11:30.249
can they

11:32.449 --> 11:39.399
Nothing can be created by man on his own tani just to use something from nature so

11:42.860 --> 11:50.439
On one side we have it now there was one polygon he is a failure he is a capillary

11:52.069 --> 11:56.889
So he joined an organization, which was trying to save people from

11:57.649 --> 11:59.649
all other than his fault

12:00.019 --> 12:04.209
He tries to send them and he became quite prominent there

12:04.999 --> 12:08.859
And then instead of said sending them to Catholic churches. He said

12:12.769 --> 12:17.529
And he said let me be your mother like a priest is good idea I don't want to get up from you

12:17.529 --> 12:22.448
But then I can catch a real people spending more. That's how we got then our and all that people even them

12:22.970 --> 12:28.839
And he makes fun of folk made fun of everyone and he's there laughing aloud is explicitly

12:29.690 --> 12:31.690
He's arranging all that

12:33.320 --> 12:36.459
Somebody made him and he said that I've been to these and that

12:37.730 --> 12:42.339
So he said now I think I'm fed up not go to Catholicism. He said did you try third?

12:42.339 --> 12:45.069
You better try that's the last time you tried it

12:50.990 --> 12:56.049
It's a very interesting intelligent man and he comes to my program alright and

12:57.560 --> 13:00.339
Somebody asked him that why do you go to her yoga program?

13:00.339 --> 13:04.929
He said I have to find out there also may be some people not busy. So I must find him out

13:06.800 --> 13:10.060
Tops to see me a very interesting person very interesting is a priest

13:12.380 --> 13:17.950
And also the lady chief lady who is doing the job he's made a resurgence and also this

13:19.100 --> 13:21.430
Marie is had joined that organisation

13:21.430 --> 13:26.140
So there are three surgeries one is then another is the secretary in another is Marty

13:26.600 --> 13:33.159
Who are trying to save people to go to the Catholic Church? Imagine they are actually saving people from Catholic Church

13:46.100 --> 13:53.679
So this kind of a thing you must fall then you must have a very general appeal and you must also find out how

13:55.490 --> 13:58.960
You can approach these people and you should say we have formed such a such

13:59.960 --> 14:01.960
organization here and

14:02.120 --> 14:04.359
Also in America they are going to form another one

14:04.640 --> 14:11.949
So you can see we have branches in America and also in India and branches all over see we can form everywhere

14:12.890 --> 14:19.749
Such branch is not difficult in Sidney and he's the head of that branch. Mr. Brian who has come all the way to see us

14:23.060 --> 14:27.280
You can even have a formal inauguration by the Prime Minister

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
That remained I must take on hard work

14:38.240 --> 14:45.549
She gave us a bite to eat rhubarb ice, can you imagine can there be anything worse than that?

14:54.830 --> 14:56.919
Must be some sinister joy

15:05.840 --> 15:09.459
So I would suggest that you form a

15:10.100 --> 15:14.530
Very cute over it. All of you are sahaja Yogi's I know if nobody will give up the secrets

15:14.530 --> 15:16.530
Is there anybody who you want the secret?

15:16.820 --> 15:18.820
Please raise your hand

15:23.600 --> 15:30.430
So all this has to be worked out very carefully and understanding that we have to do a tremendous work

15:31.370 --> 15:35.979
We have to save so many people and they are also half hearted

15:36.620 --> 15:38.390
suddenly you find

15:38.390 --> 15:40.989
I've lost one child here and a one child

15:42.620 --> 15:49.870
So it's a tremendous task and do this task you have to be very cautious careful and all the methods that are employed

15:52.610 --> 16:00.060
Only thing you do not do the Sahara I don't kill anybody. That's what you do that will give it to me

16:06.000 --> 16:07.980
You need not tell lies

16:07.980 --> 16:09.980
But you need not tell everything

16:11.100 --> 16:16.700
Everything need not be told to everyone there's not necessary. They do not have right to know everything about us

16:17.339 --> 16:23.749
That's all right. So this kind of a thing we should form now. You all should have degrees those who are there?

16:24.540 --> 16:28.459
So put the only remedies and pids there. Oh

16:33.690 --> 16:35.690
Geez and everything

16:43.410 --> 16:48.080
They are enamored by this movie you can wear a tie pin if you want

16:51.510 --> 16:55.279
Find out all the methods to see and I'll go to a special day a dresser

16:57.630 --> 16:59.659
Some people can even wear a wig I do

17:05.110 --> 17:07.110
I

17:08.689 --> 17:12.459
Take out your rings where you have your mother's humble photograph. I

17:13.279 --> 17:17.709
Bet you take out also settings and things inside you can wear something but not outside

17:17.929 --> 17:23.288
Or if you are wearing by chance to just turn it round. She be careful not to show the photographs

17:23.289 --> 17:25.289
Otherwise, they'll be shocked to see

17:26.360 --> 17:31.659
It's all camouflage but what to do with these stupid fools here we have tried everything to see

17:32.269 --> 17:38.049
Between them we choose. I mean you've done everything that was possible under the sahaja yoga regime

17:38.049 --> 17:42.609
But think they don't want to sit. That was the best thing you starting go straight forward march

17:43.340 --> 17:46.689
It's over at hua hin come back. I do think

17:51.409 --> 17:54.999
You tried with that Archbishop of Canterbury I

17:56.779 --> 17:59.559
Saw the bishop off in London

18:01.399 --> 18:05.229
The bishop the main bishop off in London

18:06.320 --> 18:08.320
Sitting just next to me

18:08.659 --> 18:14.259
He never talked of God. Nothing was talking about gold prices this team that thing

18:15.889 --> 18:17.090
But

18:17.090 --> 18:22.569
He's like the most of the vicar and everything. That was there wine the most of all

18:23.179 --> 18:25.929
40 may not be getting so much you see in the church and

18:33.110 --> 18:38.469
See God you use the biggest cigar and pocketed 2/3 of them

18:47.940 --> 18:53.749
Absolutely when he was wearing the scarlet see that's the color suggested already

18:55.500 --> 19:02.630
In this the book of Revelation the scarlet scarlet color, see how they are wearing Scott

19:09.620 --> 19:15.519
Absolutely frivolous people and they are misguiding all these people so we have to also

19:17.029 --> 19:23.559
Change our dresses and get them into the phone we find some people in there

19:27.049 --> 19:30.549
Now on these clients you start then you

19:31.909 --> 19:34.329
Have a meeting with all these people

19:35.090 --> 19:37.569
here get the name of all the

19:38.390 --> 19:43.149
newspapers this thing that thing and approach them and

19:43.789 --> 19:45.999
Then tell them that we have got first

19:49.159 --> 19:55.839
People who have come to us is sahaja yoga company there may be thoughts whatever it is, but this is what

19:57.139 --> 19:59.169
We found it in Sydney they did

20:00.350 --> 20:05.949
And this is what is the other papers have done it in Guinea bodies think that's it. So why not here?

20:07.639 --> 20:10.929
They can't say no peace because you are going to give the business

20:12.320 --> 20:14.559
Later on. I don't know what sort

20:17.840 --> 20:21.189
Is there any other suggestion

20:31.280 --> 20:33.280
What is it

20:37.670 --> 20:39.670
Anything you are that

20:44.540 --> 20:49.389
No, no Congress should be America make it two inverted nation, but

20:50.750 --> 20:55.869
Whatever you claim. You are that you are higher than all these United Nations or anything for to learn

20:56.900 --> 20:58.900
Whatever you sell not Bolton at all

21:00.440 --> 21:02.440
Is it

21:03.200 --> 21:07.390
Whatever I say it never amounts to go sleep except that you with lots of vibrations

21:09.140 --> 21:12.249
It doesn't matter whatever you say call your UN body will refine it

21:18.320 --> 21:20.320
This is why not

21:20.660 --> 21:25.179
The children that we are working like United Nations only

21:26.480 --> 21:30.130
you immediately become toxic, you know, we don't know I

21:31.940 --> 21:33.940
Don't know that

21:34.309 --> 21:36.309
What do they have all you get?

21:37.010 --> 21:39.999
Such in so many idiots working at great people

21:40.970 --> 21:45.640
Ambassador speak the people that just eat it. They have no brains nothing. I

21:46.490 --> 21:48.849
Have seen go to their house. I

21:50.150 --> 21:53.109
Don't know how how they develop this kind of philosophy

21:54.230 --> 21:55.460
but

21:55.460 --> 21:57.610
Already we went to an ambassador spec

21:58.580 --> 22:00.819
Well, you started telling me something

22:09.000 --> 22:11.300
CP came there was also watching them

22:11.940 --> 22:15.559
So he tasked me Indian language. Do you understand anything what he's saying? I

22:16.530 --> 22:18.530
thought something wrong with

22:26.250 --> 22:33.229
Etcetera then I said wild laugh engine sometime. You said I I don't know. I hope I'm writing laughing at the right time

22:37.860 --> 22:39.949
Well, he was on for half an hour

22:47.460 --> 22:53.270
And his laughter was neither crying or laughing sort of an expression, you know, you don't know what he was going to say

22:54.390 --> 22:57.170
So then another he get free soft

22:59.010 --> 23:03.260
Units after he did they give lectures like idiots. They don't know what they are talking

23:04.560 --> 23:06.330
There are big people

23:06.330 --> 23:09.260
And when they give lectures are so embarrassed. You don't know where to

23:10.080 --> 23:13.910
There's no sense there. So dignity. There's no understanding nothing. I

23:15.660 --> 23:21.649
Mean you will find only one or two persons in an organization sensitive the rest are all idiots

23:24.150 --> 23:26.150
Top top rank

23:27.090 --> 23:29.990
It's possible to understand how they manage to

23:31.380 --> 23:33.410
These are the days of idiots I tell you

23:36.240 --> 23:38.240
These are the days of Indians

23:38.820 --> 23:46.610
If you are an idiot, then you are at a high position that must be because everybody is afraid of intelligent people

23:47.400 --> 23:52.369
see, so I don't think no Prime Minister likes no president likes an

23:53.010 --> 23:55.430
intelligent back to with it because he might be ousted you see

23:55.950 --> 24:01.520
So they want to have media offers, but actually they in that competition they pick up only the idiots

24:02.490 --> 24:06.650
And that's how you find all this problem is that you don't know how to talk to them

24:07.590 --> 24:09.590
You don't know what to say

24:10.620 --> 24:14.719
Within five minutes you will be amazed what?

24:16.360 --> 24:22.630
That they are holding such a big position you have to remember all the time. Otherwise, maybe your driver is better than them

24:24.470 --> 24:27.549
Perhaps they drink too much. Well these parties they

24:28.190 --> 24:34.390
are affected by drinks, or maybe I mean, some of them are supposed to be big a

24:35.510 --> 24:37.510
Educated Cambridge Oxford

24:38.420 --> 24:40.420
But no hot water

24:41.690 --> 24:44.920
All sorts of people big big positions in I

24:47.210 --> 24:50.679
Mean sahaja, Yogi's are also from there. They don't seem so intuitive

24:50.840 --> 24:53.890
That's these people aha like from John Hopkins

24:54.230 --> 24:59.799
Institute and all that see I told with a bar about somebody whom I met from the same Institute I said is anything

24:59.990 --> 25:02.439
how to do they do that can't understand

25:03.080 --> 25:05.199
So you said there are lots of leaders there mother

25:21.169 --> 25:23.529
Our team this must be the reason that all the

25:25.400 --> 25:27.400
Heads of these

25:27.410 --> 25:28.580
countries

25:28.580 --> 25:30.580
must be frightened of

25:30.830 --> 25:34.929
intelligent people so they must be selecting only people who are

25:35.750 --> 25:37.580
little idiotic

25:37.580 --> 25:45.130
And then they can find them on a wrongful to see and then they can always resolve them with some weaknesses something must be done

25:45.350 --> 25:49.360
This must be the reason otherwise, how can you have such a set of idiots all around?

25:53.270 --> 25:55.659
So this is how we have to manage and I think

25:57.559 --> 25:59.949
If you can really form this organization

26:01.220 --> 26:07.539
properly and save these people from the disaster YouTube is there that is

26:09.470 --> 26:13.059
Really the work that one has to very carefully

26:15.049 --> 26:16.700
Understand

26:16.700 --> 26:22.419
All of you should give them some ideas even locally. You see if you go to a smaller place. They'll be so excited

26:23.299 --> 26:29.229
That Oh God such a big organization has come to us and that's how you can impress them

26:29.960 --> 26:31.960
You can use my car if you like

26:33.500 --> 26:36.069
Or we can buy a second-hand what CDs

26:37.880 --> 26:40.030
Or we can even buy a second-hand response

26:41.450 --> 26:43.450
We can get it on a high

26:51.020 --> 26:53.049
We should do all these tricks, you know, I

26:54.320 --> 27:01.689
how you should talk and everything you better study some people or they talk how they stop and

27:03.020 --> 27:07.569
How long they talk how they behave how they impress you can give some tips after all

27:21.659 --> 27:29.359
Not rolls-royce let's have something different one CD, but you shouldn't take that say a

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Jeep there isn't

27:36.840 --> 27:39.829
Something either we have to have sensible car

27:40.320 --> 27:45.830
We're not being a small slice is too much for general do something, you know taught you to judge yourself

27:47.700 --> 27:49.700
Something in between

27:50.190 --> 27:53.960
Otherwise they'll think some false would not have given you as a present

27:57.539 --> 27:59.539
He does that

28:01.409 --> 28:08.959
So have something in between, which car you think is best which is journalistic

28:32.130 --> 28:38.329
I've see now. I don't know my impressions wave it over. I don't have that car very much. It's like a horse with

28:39.600 --> 28:42.079
two camels back inside

28:45.809 --> 28:53.569
But see whatever that this must become a circus if he knows all these things so you must have what correcting sweetbreads

28:56.490 --> 28:58.490
But that's pretty expensive

29:07.110 --> 29:09.110
Carabas

29:10.170 --> 29:12.560
So don't use cheap cuts what I'm saying

29:13.740 --> 29:21.229
don't use if not those ROI that you don't have none of us have even a second and your family don't around but

29:21.720 --> 29:23.720
don't use any car that

29:24.450 --> 29:26.450
Would look cheap

29:27.180 --> 29:29.180
Ishtar say

29:29.250 --> 29:32.900
Something good for a journalist to see Association something like that

29:33.840 --> 29:35.989
But you should be careful about that

29:37.110 --> 29:39.110
Car is important

29:42.030 --> 29:47.540
Then your gestures and behaviors you see how smart you pack things and how you get out

29:48.780 --> 29:49.980
and

29:49.980 --> 29:51.980
also briefcases to see

29:52.320 --> 29:54.270
very important

29:54.270 --> 29:56.270
And I'm realize that you carry

29:57.540 --> 30:01.190
Yep, so let's have a training center for that

30:04.020 --> 30:08.119
I'm not so you can get somebody to train you off

30:16.620 --> 30:18.620
What did you do?

30:26.250 --> 30:28.250
In football

30:52.620 --> 30:58.160
No, but you should not sound clear, you know should sound very British I

30:58.950 --> 31:03.830
Mean say like that James one can see women around only successful. I

31:10.830 --> 31:12.830
Think who can teach us that

31:16.740 --> 31:19.790
They would fall gommi well

31:21.270 --> 31:27.349
There are study is interesting to study a manners mannerism little bit to study how to impress

31:31.830 --> 31:33.830
Ask your brother how he does it

31:45.120 --> 31:48.590
God I don't people are distressed in the shadow

31:51.210 --> 31:57.529
Canadian people can be addressed by a pillow but not English

32:09.700 --> 32:15.210
Lester when they go to it who's mainly stock where 40 degrees is the temperature?

32:16.360 --> 32:21.809
Canary gipsy left cut this up all their three places because many too often

32:26.020 --> 32:32.639
But I stupid fresh people here till there are logs which is their game the faster this time so ever

32:33.940 --> 32:37.740
But what to do, that's the meteor. That's the one we have to use. What is food media

32:39.850 --> 32:41.850
We have to move this big in I

32:42.730 --> 32:47.730
Have taken half of their moves by team is China now you tell me what is to be done

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
on a breslav

32:57.640 --> 33:01.319
Article about you in Australia was in a a

33:02.260 --> 33:04.319
newspaper called Sydney shot

33:05.440 --> 33:07.440
which was

33:30.850 --> 33:33.870
So let's use that on that matter I'll have to be agreement

33:34.690 --> 33:36.690
massage parlor anywhere

33:37.120 --> 33:39.660
But then you to you land up into a place like this

33:40.210 --> 33:45.780
Where there's not half an inch is a holy night and you want to create a Holy Land out of it

33:46.180 --> 33:48.870
Then how what do you do? You have to put your feet in your

33:54.640 --> 33:58.319
Mother it makes no difference wherever she goes third man

33:58.320 --> 34:03.270
I have given all freedom to do what you like publish me anywhere Aquila

34:06.700 --> 34:08.700
Like this girl

34:08.920 --> 34:10.920
Not to our know

34:11.410 --> 34:15.449
She somebody that about a gentle CP that it was not dignified

34:16.420 --> 34:24.389
Compared to mrs. Srivastava dignity. It was not dignified. She's a very dignified and a saline lady, you know, because in the office, I'm extremely

34:25.750 --> 34:27.750
unified

34:27.970 --> 34:29.970
Not with my children maybe I

34:30.370 --> 34:31.540
can

34:31.540 --> 34:33.540
Be very simple then

34:34.240 --> 34:39.660
So they thought that how could it be and this lady has really taken advantage of her or sort of things?

34:39.660 --> 34:43.589
Oh, no rather upset about it. So I said, all right doesn't matter

34:43.990 --> 34:49.740
It's all right, whatever way she has seen me she must have written so I was thinking she should do another article again

35:01.660 --> 35:03.660
About me

35:04.060 --> 35:09.600
Just him and despite that I mean though, I mean she may be clearly I won't say it

35:09.600 --> 35:12.660
It was frivolous, but she it was a little flippant

35:13.360 --> 35:20.519
Flippant is the word just flippin to see it didn't go into details at all or anything. I said the biggest response just tonight

35:21.610 --> 35:23.610
Under what did she do about it?

35:30.190 --> 35:32.580
So she may like to do it again in a proper way

35:34.270 --> 35:39.780
This is once I know another side is that if you must have seen

35:41.740 --> 35:47.160
An article in a magazine, which you were telling me Indian Maxie

35:49.150 --> 35:51.150
Which impressed you very much

35:52.150 --> 35:54.010
Coal is

35:54.010 --> 35:56.010
Did you see that?

35:56.650 --> 35:58.650
You have yet

36:11.829 --> 36:17.639
All right to better send him and get it immediately, all right, you know another thing is his position has come

36:21.069 --> 36:24.659
All right now with

36:28.779 --> 36:33.929
Mr. Cody he wanted to publish a book. He said so

36:35.200 --> 36:39.359
Which will cost fifteen to twenty thousand rupees. It's not difficult to that

36:41.380 --> 36:47.309
In which he wants to write about the experiences of all the people from my childhood and this and that

36:49.839 --> 36:53.189
But my idea was that you sahaja Yogi's should

36:54.249 --> 36:56.849
compile together the experiences

36:57.339 --> 37:03.599
Say of different same one may experiment people to do it many people should be

37:03.999 --> 37:08.759
Say Sydney people should do it the people in England should do it and they should

37:09.309 --> 37:12.959
Write about each and every person you see those who have to write

37:12.960 --> 37:18.869
So those who have to write something about me should send it to say now from Bom Bom Bay

37:19.119 --> 37:21.629
Those who are in Bombay should write to somebody involving

37:22.239 --> 37:27.749
Those who are in Delhi should write to somebody in Delhi who will compile it put it together and put it in a proper way

37:28.239 --> 37:29.799
some sort of a

37:29.799 --> 37:31.059
right to

37:31.059 --> 37:36.238
Vomit people to find out somebody who is of journalistic nature and here

37:37.839 --> 37:39.279
Also

37:39.279 --> 37:45.929
These must be sent to say hevene or someone and the same committee that we have see should deal with this side

37:46.749 --> 37:53.218
To find out what you think is preferred. What is to be given and all the fantastic things that we are afraid even

37:53.799 --> 37:54.819
after

37:54.819 --> 37:56.819
They're saying about the petroleum

37:57.789 --> 38:02.549
Write it down everything and all these experiences can be compared

38:03.759 --> 38:06.539
and the you can put the name as

38:08.059 --> 38:11.288
Miracles off overreach or something like that

38:13.430 --> 38:18.519
And then he can put it the way he lies we should say we supply you for the Chilean from him

38:19.039 --> 38:21.219
Or then he can edit it

38:21.829 --> 38:24.308
And also we can get it published

38:25.430 --> 38:29.529
If he wants polish it let him publish it each other way. He was hurt

38:33.650 --> 38:36.249
We can get it very nicely done for him

38:38.509 --> 38:40.509
But he must publish the book

38:42.259 --> 38:46.929
And the book must win English not in the enemies, is that the main point

38:49.130 --> 38:55.690
But also we should not use very difficult English uses because it should be internationally understood

39:00.529 --> 39:05.229
Not only big sentences complicated and also using idioms

39:05.960 --> 39:12.129
From English literature and things that's no another goes into the hex. Now people are not lips just a

39:12.950 --> 39:17.889
Lot of the people who write our literature and they use all these idioms from the literature

39:18.680 --> 39:21.849
Those who are not used to just do it. How much that you understand?

39:23.660 --> 39:26.889
They try to show off you see that I had average this book and I'm

39:27.680 --> 39:30.609
Best thing is to put directly not using any

39:31.309 --> 39:36.699
Quotations for many literally good you can use it from by building ships if you want

39:37.220 --> 39:39.999
But that is not necessary for living experiences

39:41.329 --> 39:48.998
but just can see that my hand started speaking to me and you can say Christ have said I just I've never

39:50.539 --> 39:52.519
And

39:52.519 --> 39:57.849
That book can be done very well and will be sold all over the world

40:03.920 --> 40:07.660
We can send him an introduction also very beautiful introduction to the subject

40:09.350 --> 40:15.579
So while the sahaja Yogi's should sit down and write all the good things not like this that

40:16.310 --> 40:18.310
half uttered and half a

40:19.850 --> 40:23.110
Lifetime all right, but still I had

40:26.990 --> 40:31.390
With buts and ifs you should not write if you have any buts and ifs in keep each other

40:31.580 --> 40:37.449
So the how fake people should not write it them you sir? You have missed a very nice part

40:47.120 --> 40:49.299
We could like to see what happened

40:50.660 --> 40:56.169
So that you can see that itself. We are forming a new organization

40:59.240 --> 41:04.300
Called Golden Age International for journalistic miss you

41:10.670 --> 41:15.730
Well, you shouldn't also love no matter what you are teaching them should we marry see this

41:16.370 --> 41:20.829
Otherwise will be called as DVD people. The delivery will respond, you know

41:22.400 --> 41:24.459
Just imagine they knew that he used to give

41:35.140 --> 41:36.950
Oh

41:36.950 --> 41:42.819
In this book you can write about people who had a negative approach

41:43.969 --> 41:45.969
like the letter to our to be

41:46.910 --> 41:48.910
shivering

41:52.999 --> 41:59.228
Like unit each other exposed that's the time we can expose them now

42:03.589 --> 42:08.318
The responses introduction first and the responses are then

42:09.680 --> 42:17.559
First give the responses of the gurus who are realized souls how they have acted. They have done this and of

42:27.950 --> 42:33.850
My show means you can write that first is to say there's nothing like a devil nothing no each

42:35.180 --> 42:41.950
Everything is fine. Right as soon as he heard the name of Mataji Nirmala dishes. He said she's the devil

42:44.870 --> 42:46.870
Otherwise Devi did not exist

42:55.370 --> 43:00.339
Yes, I know we should say I went to this fellow and this happened that happened this book I

43:20.870 --> 43:22.870
Mean you can say

43:23.120 --> 43:26.319
That we had many people one after another

43:27.170 --> 43:30.190
We had series of things you see with us

43:30.190 --> 43:35.139
I think I mean has got some of these things that this fellow from Denmark had sent. Have you got

43:45.210 --> 43:47.210
Why did cleaned up on that also

43:54.300 --> 43:57.650
Attend let us find out so you can mention that

43:58.530 --> 44:02.959
Although there were so many indications from people. We could not see

44:04.110 --> 44:09.529
Even this fellow said this is the mantras meaning we could not see you see some other than our mind was like that

44:09.900 --> 44:13.789
So to prove that there was a kind of a position or a kind of air

44:15.660 --> 44:23.510
Curtain on our head that we couldn't see him though. These were pointed out to see nobody bothered because one

44:24.450 --> 44:32.300
Gentleman who has floated him long time back from America though. He didn't understand the subtler side of it, but he gave the growth side

44:32.880 --> 44:37.519
This was really remarkable that people could get over it

44:38.700 --> 44:42.830
how he made money how he had to embezzle money for him and

44:43.650 --> 44:45.030
How many?

44:45.030 --> 44:47.030
millions and millions of dollars

44:47.550 --> 44:51.919
There to take up everything he had given that later with that himself

44:52.830 --> 44:57.860
And he also said that if I have mentioned anything wrong let them prosecute

45:00.780 --> 45:02.780
But nothing happens

45:07.229 --> 45:12.439
And about women how he had relationship with women and all that he did mention I

45:13.079 --> 45:17.119
Don't know if those papers are there or not, but it was so cool, huh?

45:19.410 --> 45:21.410
The name of the fellow

45:23.460 --> 45:28.189
That's running things were like that which whereas he says we are given to Peter to see which have kept them

45:28.440 --> 45:35.149
But if you can't find whatever it is that they were warning coming all through you see anybody who is intelligent and see this

45:36.869 --> 45:38.400
And convert

45:38.400 --> 45:40.400
But nobody listened to it. I

45:40.799 --> 45:45.079
Mean you all thought that you are doing for as a cause of CCD

45:45.839 --> 45:47.839
world government imagine

45:51.720 --> 45:57.799
He because he made the whole show such a me with the show was such that you had to be

45:58.680 --> 46:00.680
Now you having to that?

46:01.109 --> 46:03.109
14 year one is it?

46:04.259 --> 46:05.940
Now this one also

46:05.940 --> 46:07.410
he's got

46:07.410 --> 46:10.879
15,000 disciples even now even now he speak

46:11.579 --> 46:13.818
And he calls himself perfect. Cool

46:14.430 --> 46:20.269
One of his disciples came a Tony does know even how to say perfect is a perfect. Perfect guru

46:20.269 --> 46:26.748
I am a perfectly was repeating that word again. Anyway, and this fellow the English and you had to translate it and

46:27.450 --> 46:29.869
the Queen of Spain complained to the

46:30.539 --> 46:33.498
to the ambassador of Spain Indian ambassador of Spain

46:34.079 --> 46:38.869
That it's a shameful thing how we can send such a man to our country

46:38.880 --> 46:43.489
He has just finished our young generation. The whole race is lost

46:48.640 --> 46:50.640
Nobody listens, you know, that's the trouble

46:51.880 --> 46:58.380
He's a perfect guru perfect I made them mad you don't delegate selfish

47:00.670 --> 47:02.670
So the whole book would be

47:03.099 --> 47:07.048
Where are the seaters? Where are they lost what has happened to them?

47:07.900 --> 47:10.769
Everything can be covering this in a video with me

47:13.599 --> 47:15.599
Tragedies

47:22.059 --> 47:23.440
Industry

47:23.440 --> 47:26.669
Please leave a review is easy to be a Christian

47:27.849 --> 47:33.479
I think that's probably going in the next or next that one is you know, because we sent it

47:34.420 --> 47:37.500
It's I also have got some of the words

47:38.349 --> 47:43.828
Lunch was translated I all together so that's going in as well. I simply remarkable

47:44.160 --> 47:49.470
I am a cosmic confidence true. It's by one of these Christian sellers

47:49.470 --> 47:54.269
There's quite a good there is lots of any size without the way he is brought in with the writer

47:59.769 --> 48:01.769
Anytime

48:02.019 --> 48:04.589
Anybody who finds anything like that in writing

48:06.160 --> 48:12.389
In his state see what you can find out like we can say that they send about three taboos and

48:14.049 --> 48:16.049
Theta waves you only get it from

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
Epileptic patient

48:27.510 --> 48:33.020
Very carefully without involved in people, who are

48:37.080 --> 48:40.249
Dangerous to us but route you can help

48:41.250 --> 48:47.630
Gurus are all right, there's no how because you can use. This fellow's name on over but not people like say

48:48.450 --> 48:50.450
We can say down

48:54.780 --> 49:01.700
Like say some Prime Minister is it war with

49:04.350 --> 49:07.579
TM, for example we need not bring his name

49:09.360 --> 49:14.630
Because they won't like it and they'll try promise such people so we can around the

49:20.070 --> 49:22.070
President

49:22.290 --> 49:25.550
Before this was what was he he was a

49:26.820 --> 49:32.779
that Baptist Church somebody was from the Baptist Church was president of America was that

49:34.530 --> 49:36.530
Doctor

49:39.750 --> 49:45.500
Also these churches you see you can point out that I one person can say I've been like you and talk about these

49:46.890 --> 49:53.119
What 7:30 or what in resources the Pentecost is no, I'm asking now 20 postures

49:55.770 --> 49:57.180
There's a

49:57.180 --> 49:59.809
International. Oh, there's an organization called

50:00.450 --> 50:01.950
Family Action

50:01.950 --> 50:09.319
information and rescue already formed and it's been run by MP called pourers and he

50:09.780 --> 50:14.780
comic service employers and his phone is an organization and as you be

50:15.480 --> 50:16.870
affected

50:16.870 --> 50:18.850
the model they do

50:18.850 --> 50:20.850
if they

50:21.160 --> 50:23.220
If anyone's been detected and area

50:28.120 --> 50:33.690
You can ask them can one ask what do you have to say about visa, but we can interview that

50:50.260 --> 50:53.880
And that's very much like the movies in that needs to take

50:54.280 --> 50:59.670
teenagers and young people and keep them totally out of contact with the outside world and

50:59.980 --> 51:06.990
Keep them cut off from their parents and all this sort of things starvation diets and sugar buzzing all these techniques they used to use

51:07.120 --> 51:08.710
So I was told

51:08.710 --> 51:12.480
To help the parents who had lost their teenagers with young adult children

51:12.970 --> 51:17.249
To get them back to the D program and get the brainwashing out of them

51:17.890 --> 51:19.890
And they've got lots of useful information

51:20.530 --> 51:25.950
my dad won't see them what you see as an organisation of n1 students is very

51:28.030 --> 51:30.030
Skeptical

51:32.710 --> 51:36.419
You see but they can be quite confused right in you like this fellow

51:36.420 --> 51:41.730
I went to see him John will tell you I told him all against these so-called religions

51:42.940 --> 51:50.129
And ultimately told John that we cannot have an interview at length because people don't like to hear about religions and he made it

51:52.450 --> 51:54.450
Is he your job

51:58.510 --> 52:01.080
All right, right whatever I did to say whatever

52:05.170 --> 52:10.259
You say you have an interview with mountain broadcast but in Lawrence Spicer

52:12.940 --> 52:14.940
The interviewed mother

52:14.950 --> 52:17.700
Solely, because sahaja Yogi's wrote letters to mr

52:17.700 --> 52:25.349
Spicer out of interest from his previous interview so we can need to be filled up on what we've already done on this show

52:27.610 --> 52:30.450
Interest as sahaja Yogi's with just as people

52:31.750 --> 52:37.529
Not only sell Yogi's but you start to put non-sahaja yogis. See they didn't write at sahaja Yogi's all of them

52:39.070 --> 52:41.190
So why we should not say sahaja Yogi's wrote

52:41.190 --> 52:45.000
we should say there was a big him because he asked him that he should come and

52:48.520 --> 52:50.520
Between us in the secret of

52:54.430 --> 52:56.579
The 15 minutes interview now

52:56.580 --> 53:02.700
You can also write about you are know that or not just we had a lot of for this one. All right you can have

53:03.340 --> 53:05.340
All right

53:11.470 --> 53:13.470
On the right

53:30.650 --> 53:37.389
She got up at 4 a.m. They must have thought that you see surgeries are supposed to get up at 4 a.m

53:44.780 --> 53:52.389
Also not spicy recorded an interview between John flower and Western in fact even Christian who please grant this

53:53.240 --> 53:59.079
Interview will be broadcast in September and is mainly concerned with our attitude towards Jesus and the Ten Commandments

53:59.660 --> 54:01.390
Clip grant was not negative

54:01.390 --> 54:01.690
in fact

54:01.690 --> 54:07.809
he said in the interview that he thought sahaja of the sounded good because we follow him believe in Christ and by the

54:08.059 --> 54:15.609
Commandments but because his vibrations were tricky they seemed best to be diplomatic and not confront his ego the result of his

54:16.130 --> 54:20.260
Diplomacy maybe to make sahaja. Yoga sound rather Christian

54:24.319 --> 54:27.548
But Kollek Christian eating was given limit. Yeah

54:29.059 --> 54:36.579
That's why he did that and the other things we wrote a letter to US my pals who wrote various articles and books

54:36.980 --> 54:39.879
One article mastiff Aria. That's the father

54:41.150 --> 54:43.150
That's appearing in The Observer

54:43.430 --> 54:50.799
We said that we were certain we had found the truth and wanted a professional objective and discerning journalist to investigate our claims

54:52.309 --> 54:56.919
Dissatisfied with our authenticity write an article we have yet to hear a reply

54:58.099 --> 55:01.659
Now that you won't fuck off with you, but with this organization

55:09.559 --> 55:12.369
To write personal letters to people important

55:14.690 --> 55:18.490
No doubt well one addition to all important people better write important

55:32.960 --> 55:34.960
TV producers

55:36.019 --> 55:38.259
How did this nothing

55:39.859 --> 55:42.639
Nothing then won't even allow me five minutes there

55:53.089 --> 55:55.929
No, but let it be done by this organization, yes

55:57.079 --> 56:00.639
But you see that failure can be done by this organization

56:01.309 --> 56:03.309
I'm deaf. I'm sure

56:03.559 --> 56:10.629
The would watch it let them do it. You have to wonder but not just now you should not sound that you are hadoo

56:14.569 --> 56:22.419
You can take films of other gurus also under the circumstances you can go and see share Hari Rama

56:25.549 --> 56:27.549
All right under this

56:29.299 --> 56:31.689
Right you ask them questions I

56:33.410 --> 56:36.759
Will give you the proper thing to approximate

56:42.700 --> 56:48.570
Awesome question first of all, very nicely

56:58.720 --> 57:00.720
Then with other

57:01.720 --> 57:05.490
Guru God's we should be prepared practice organization. You can meet them

57:06.220 --> 57:08.220
take their with you and

57:08.650 --> 57:10.650
Give this to these people that

57:11.980 --> 57:13.980
These are what we are going to supply

57:23.380 --> 57:28.499
You are just talking in a very neutral way to people from Hari Rama Hari

57:33.550 --> 57:37.320
And I'll tell you the loopholes and then you ask the questions on them

57:39.940 --> 57:43.140
Like TM people, but the people who have

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
On the other

58:57.290 --> 59:04.060
We can we choose first of all give him Indian power to make building sahaja yoga to commit then we see how our body would

59:10.160 --> 59:12.160
Because then you are neutral

59:12.710 --> 59:18.460
You can ask him that this is Roman Catholic has done this and that to see I'll give you everybody through codes

59:20.270 --> 59:22.660
So let us prepare some forces on these

59:29.480 --> 59:31.480
He was quite

59:32.450 --> 59:38.560
Himself he did it in contact with his adviser to Indian Affairs

59:53.990 --> 59:59.290
And also a bishop behavior to know also called a bishop in Haven teeth there's also

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:12.730
Would you aware that rostra strategies advise mm

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.079
Advanced of the take the point where of the teeth

01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:26.769
But you must know where their fall wrong otherwise they'll never advance

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.140
So, that's all

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:40.270
Program

01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:42.950
How do you do that

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:48.309
is you can you say that your if anyone's messed up in a guru and they have an

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:52.329
organization what they have America import your call deprogrammers

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:58.059
So if anyone's messed up in good and if they phone at the police or or social workers

01:00:58.059 --> 01:01:01.329
They put you on to you and then you talk to the person

01:01:01.819 --> 01:01:05.798
Who's affected and then you make them better and then you go down

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:18.509
Tada you see muster this organisation also

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:39.359
Whatever you like with loving that won't put them

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:52.669
See in this world whatever you say it has always two sides it's a facade

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.180
Everything has two sides

01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:58.939
Like if you say this is a place for

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:07.339
People to understand religions and their mistakes or whatever it although he just people will be standing against

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:11.569
One of the aim would be would it to

01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:17.568
The people who were the members of Golden Age

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:22.849
International they would indicate to the people that they were in contact with that

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:28.399
They were employed by sahaja yoga for that purpose. That's what I think. You should keep it out

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.849
Connection should not do that

01:02:35.849 --> 01:02:39.109
But what you said you can do is to get some people

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:46.549
If they come to you to your organization, you should say that you see some people have told us that sahaja

01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:49.189
yoga has helped you can track here but

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:55.069
We are not recommending, but if you want to

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:17.240
Confirm that we are a ferocious and PIDs and all that terrible reintroduction

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:26.179
You see you are not to say that it is an

01:03:26.579 --> 01:03:31.278
Organization of sahaja Yogi's at all even if they won't ask you your sahaja Yogi's they will never drink me

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:34.099
See, that's why we have no dress. No

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:36.650
badging nothing

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:41.990
Written that class circles. That's why I've never allowed many people used to say let us wear

01:03:43.049 --> 01:03:48.679
Put a pajama. I said nothing even the marks you are not to have anything. That's only secretly

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:55.279
Till we reach a certain stage this way so you don't have to sing our surrogates to tell Chelsea is that now?

01:03:55.279 --> 01:03:57.089
This is doctor daily

01:03:57.089 --> 01:04:01.179
File all right doctor name fine then. Mr

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.919
And this that and also you can add up the IDs and all these things

01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:13.809
This is what they respects not sahaja Yogi's they

01:04:16.369 --> 01:04:22.689
Think Sergio give needs there must be some criminals using the carrot think that sahaja Yogi's some good people

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:25.419
they cannot think of such people who can be really

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:40.339
They always

01:04:40.339 --> 01:04:41.990
fail to be impressed

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:44.260
On the depth of knowledge. It's a knowledge of God

01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:48.759
And this is self stands up. They don't think to ask where you've got the credentials for

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:54.339
Yourself election say about Lucy when I saw Jogi speak see me even a little girl

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.389
Like an Obama when she speaks people are amazed. How does she go?

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:11.219
Every centers that you speak help that sparkle. You see they all know you do not say

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:17.160
If there is a beautiful rose somewhere he you know, because it's fun

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.840
You know the fragrance with that they mean no it is something great

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:28.409
You need not say you are sahaja Yogi's by saying that we have achieved nothing with these horrible means

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:30.570
Yes, so let us go in another way

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:34.350
You see if you talk of

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.720
The flower nothing works out so talk of the fractals by

01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:47.219
Flower they are not interested but us have let them have your friend

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:52.080
This is another one you can impress by Tula

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:05.059
And we have a part of the organization something research into nuclear aspect how to

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:12.019
See when you are international see I'm going to

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:21.369
But you see peace cannot come from without peace has to come from within

01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:26.979
See if you don't have nuclear weapons. We'll have some other way now Americans are

01:06:27.799 --> 01:06:33.849
Look at them. They are selling their weapons to all other countries at a very cheap rate. You see, what is this?

01:06:33.849 --> 01:06:40.239
this is even worse than having atomic bomb because atomic bomb for once for all finish everyone see

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.789
But this is very bad to make everybody fight

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.170
So there are ways and methods

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:56.649
Under say it's a temperament it's an attitude. It's the inner circle being which is not flat pieces

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:59.379
They're violent, but they have no peace within

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:03.730
Actually they enjoy

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.170
Enjoy

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.739
How to deal with people

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.269
Through our connections with them. They come to sahaja yoga. They see us as

01:07:22.119 --> 01:07:24.119
as the speakers

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.829
Because they seen us as as a representative of both International and NEC as Napoleon

01:07:30.099 --> 01:07:32.099
How we should deal with that situation?

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.190
You should let people from outside

01:07:36.729 --> 01:07:41.129
You see for example, you can go to Toronto and let the Toronto people have any me know

01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:47.309
This better

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:53.009
But is not a brand can say I've come from Sydney on the way and we've done so much

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:58.710
There in Sydney so much as attached we have found out these and all that who is going to find out about it, right?

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:07.079
So in New York you work for sahaja yoga we

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:27.599
Need to make like cut clients are willing to pay money

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:35.099
See you only one client that is sahaja yoga

01:08:36.699 --> 01:08:38.699
They don't pay any money

01:08:39.489 --> 01:08:43.468
Nobody means we have a client as such. How can there be except for these boos?

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.799
Because we talk against them they're not piercing I don't think this question will arise

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.380
This client

01:08:56.619 --> 01:08:59.459
In this in this relationship we are generation

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.980
You see what will happen now, we'll have let's see. We will either go to these gurus

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:11.580
Alright, so they come to because we are saying we are giving alternative this thing, but when you will go and see them

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:15.840
All right, we will give you a publicity this thing that thing but we tell the truth

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.300
You should tell them that you see we are here

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.509
But we tell the truth because that's what we have written in our this day

01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:26.699
and you try to see the truth in it you see so they would like to have you there because we have a

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.610
sort of a position to tell the truth you say

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:37.500
So you can go there are any journalist goes and he can say whatever he likes they cannot stop. So you worship the

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.779
Flaws of that thing and then you can write about them and tell about them

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.580
This is what we have seen

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:58.320
So there won't be I mean if they they force I don't think they'll pay you for telling all these things but even even

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.680
if they pay

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:08.670
You can tell them that our see the voluntary organization and we are doing this one III work

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:15.750
Like that or if I take the money what so we throw it in the tips for this it itself

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.849
If somebody comes along once a publicity campaign about self

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.740
so

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:31.050
Well public relations flow as well as selling something like so how'd you get it could also sell

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:34.830
400

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:43.109
We won't have any magazine or anything. Yeah, but in the same way that

01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:48.090
The members of the organization could go to the media

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:51.090
Trying to interest them in

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:53.250
publishing material about sahaja yoga

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:58.980
That facility could also be used for other

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:06.870
Money-making concerns like a surf making firm could come to the Golden Age Internet

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.280
to employ that

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.280
organization to

01:11:11.619 --> 01:11:13.619
give cheap set

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:17.250
Quality image or

01:11:19.599 --> 01:11:21.989
You see there is the possibility of a

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:27.869
legitimate business and honest business around the dishonest

01:11:29.679 --> 01:11:32.339
What Michael is appointed Michael is raising

01:11:35.139 --> 01:11:41.639
In other words, it could be the possibility of some members of the organization becoming

01:11:42.489 --> 01:11:44.489
totally involved

01:11:45.309 --> 01:11:47.309
and financially

01:11:51.159 --> 01:11:59.129
I see what I'm saying these things again. Take you to the same. So the year escape

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.940
See now you can play out certain things like

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:18.810
Something like that we can see that

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.700
We can have a

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.269
Say we can get some sahaja Yogi's to say that

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.289
This special type of sugar is vibrated for us

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:55.360
Has done you good so you can refer to some organization saying that this sugar is available from this state or say

01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:00.969
Genuine things like genuine food or something, you know mean more of the genuineness

01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:08.529
If you can work out say soaps now are made here about horrible chemicals if you can get something

01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:12.790
Genuine you see

01:13:13.190 --> 01:13:19.600
On that could be done later on like that whichever is genuine thing, but we have to test it and see for ourselves

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.790
Things like that we can work out. If you go to them should be genuine stuff, which is helpful

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:29.199
otherwise you see we cannot go on for anything cheap type thing like

01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:36.580
For liver patients we can say we have a medicine or something. All right

01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:50.460
For you all right

01:13:56.739 --> 01:13:58.739
Mother I used to be

01:13:58.749 --> 01:14:00.149
an illustrator

01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:01.269
I

01:14:01.269 --> 01:14:03.628
might worthless in the New York Times and

01:14:04.059 --> 01:14:10.469
Psychology Today and so forth and I've been wanting I've been wanting to use my artwork in some way

01:14:10.469 --> 01:14:17.998
I know it has the potential to be beautiful if I was working for a good cause such as dodgy

01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:19.999
Oh and not just my own

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.050
my own feelings

01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:27.538
Is there any way that I could help that I could this says they will make full use of it

01:14:27.579 --> 01:14:30.869
I'm going to use all of you, but this I'm already using

01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:33.629
All right

01:14:36.879 --> 01:14:40.169
You have to find out all the talents in this kind of world to see but

01:14:42.939 --> 01:14:46.319
Now for example David's father is so too honest a fellow I must

01:14:48.369 --> 01:14:54.208
He may give in your secret, I hope David you have changed a little bit it's too straightforward

01:14:56.379 --> 01:15:02.069
You cannot believe them so you have to play a drama you have to be an artist to play that reminds me

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:04.949
I'm a myself hopelessly back so I'm out of it

01:15:04.949 --> 01:15:10.438
You say I just can't do it and just love people so don't take me but you have to be careful

01:15:10.659 --> 01:15:16.348
If you give in the secret, then we are all take few. But those who can keep the secret

01:15:16.349 --> 01:15:20.069
All right, at least when you are representing it outside, you have to be very careful

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:23.339
So to see all the sahaja Yogi's know each other immediately

01:15:23.349 --> 01:15:28.978
there's a lag gap all of them sitting there and just start giving the bundle as I have it you see I

01:15:29.769 --> 01:15:31.769
thought of

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:36.510
Anybody like

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.149
Cunningness I should say this horrible cutting people, you know, you have to be very careful if you start

01:15:45.849 --> 01:15:48.719
giving out your secrets by any method I

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:50.859
would say when

01:15:50.859 --> 01:15:53.729
Phil is another very over honest fellow you see

01:15:53.889 --> 01:15:57.569
So you shouldn't try to be over always to see here over on us

01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:01.019
Then they find you not a fact that we know this is the one

01:16:02.649 --> 01:16:07.318
To do some practice in drama. Have you ever taken part in a play?

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.840
Oh

01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:26.750
Very much. What about you David did you?

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:37.699
Know you better practice little drama. See that's a good idea all those who suffer from over honesty because

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:41.359
conscience and all that we are beyond all that we

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.940
Have to save this firm

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:47.840
Search term in the Stars. We can't go on playing with all these

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:53.630
Few bits of things that we have. We have to have the major thing. You have to do something about

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:08.259
You could dice the issue will come

01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:20.570
There is Olympia one

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:45.190
You didn't know what

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:53.589
If you nicely alright hmm good

01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:58.690
But you wet yourself, do you know that

01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:11.710
Handler would see

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:19.779
She has got her hair like her mother always combed the hair of the children backwards

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.850
We use the comb or brush for

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.380
well

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:13.810
That's what you must do - small little brush and give it to me for vibration

01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:17.140
I think must be on her just average the problem

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.380
That's how you discover

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:29.210
You must use brush for children

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:38.420
a popular area of television which is

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.340
Circled in depth look at some topic

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:54.170
For instance a program perhaps half hour program on Hill

01:19:56.970 --> 01:19:59.179
On such a television program

01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:05.029
Would you be willing for instance to talk on aspects of health?

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.210
in a program which would contain

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:17.990
So-called medical experts who would in fact attempt to refute the things that you were saying the interesting is that

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.759
Just now issues will come up yourself. See if you put me there also

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.860
Yoga there everything will be shocked and then you find you but first you have other people you see

01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:32.000
Build them up bring other gurus to them like that and the way you didi

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:36.679
Okay later on I can be there. But first you prepare it now

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.840
Don't that

01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:50.570
Any other solutions

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.189
We have fried it you see what we did was over, dr. Sivana

01:21:13.949 --> 01:21:16.699
he was there on the kid Cancer Research and

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:21.439
She wanted to talk about it. He is doing that and

01:21:21.989 --> 01:21:26.718
He wanted to tell other people nobody was willing to listen to it, and they thought he was going to matter

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.900
What is he was there he was doing that

01:21:37.829 --> 01:21:41.959
Nobody knows about it. He was doing research in

01:21:45.719 --> 01:21:53.419
When he went and told them that this is possible this is this they said no no resolve no matter how can that

01:21:54.929 --> 01:21:58.969
Because they cannot believe there is something higher source from where you get all

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:04.699
You see they all thing in then ego behavior that it is all their own achievements

01:22:08.489 --> 01:22:12.618
They do not want to believe in it because their existence will be zero

01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:24.350
See they asked me in India that if I make this institute for research we get a big

01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:30.950
What you call donation from the government but trusted what is there to be research here? I'm an avid research everything

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:34.490
I have know everything what is there to be research in sahaja yoga

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:42.589
And what do we are we going to do be the donation that them there was no land nothing but even then you see

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:45.830
They want you to research

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:51.350
And the organization is for research. If you say there's a solution then either prevention does not it

01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:00.829
They are not really doing it actually to find out so they are

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:27.020
How would you make the program you already have

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:35.270
So where can you be these programs that would be on the contrary you go and talk to them as a neutral body

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.190
All right, you tell them all right

01:23:37.190 --> 01:23:41.510
You would like to study you would like to this is one of the alternatives we agree accept

01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:45.289
But after all we are journalists we have to witness for all right

01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:49.370
You guys I see there loopholes and you put them up. I have never done it

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.550
They are exposed all the Guru's like this in the state

01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:55.610
That's very simple

01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:09.390
Now first you do this then you come to sahaja yoga also also criticize it in a way

01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:11.640
Which is not really please remember to great about

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.699
What did you criticize her Yoga for what did you say?

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.280
Related to

01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:35.010
Some of the practices like

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:42.779
Foot surfing and and time and soul. That's right. It was very time consuming a lot of people gave a lot of time

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.890
In other words, what are you going to do time when you go to the pocket of the time of something or

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:56.850
You see what I'm saying? That if anybody wants to refute it, it's very good. We really want. Otherwise we are more stupid

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:02.820
So what you can say say, for example if you want to criticize sahaja yoga

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.680
I get kinda

01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:30.850
Selected you can't see from the finger

01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:36.910
You can't say one thing that there are some people

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:42.790
Who still are not

01:25:54.810 --> 01:26:00.080
Anywhere near a good person or something that you can say that

01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:13.139
But some of them look excellent many of them really

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.699
So maybe there is an inner circle some sort of a doubt

01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:26.310
Everything is not

01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:39.210
Like that you can put it in

01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:44.580
You see something to say that there's something secretive about these people a little bit

01:26:45.489 --> 01:26:47.519
everything is not born first, perhaps

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.899
It is said that all knowledge will be exposed to you, but partly is known

01:26:52.449 --> 01:26:59.579
And everything everyone doesn't know that's what we gathered from some other people who are saying that we are not allowed to certain functions

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.270
Or something like that. So you see a class consciousness is there?

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:07.620
That we have some social is to raise their years

01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:12.750
Or

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.569
But when I are somebody he told me that he came to this face when he was done later

01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:40.020
See, this is the first pretty slow then we diffuse

01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:46.529
And somebody can go and say I was just dying when I came here and mother saved me. So I do it perfectly. Alright

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:56.579
You see that is the second away you should give them some photographs of when you came

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.320
Before and after

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.960
First you must educate them what they should expect

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.399
First you have to tell them what they should expect wrong realization

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:45.299
No, no, no, you can cover it with a paper or something eat up silk cloth

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.140
Then 25th, you will give them realization

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:44.639
What you don't realize Asian how will you make them understand

01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:55.230
No, you can say after say halftime you can say that let's try if you can

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:08.130
We have public meetings they're always invited but you have public meeting every week

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:15.180
When this course is from people who are coming some public meeting

01:31:36.829 --> 01:31:40.748
Well the idea arose because Tian was doing introductory

01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:48.729
We

01:31:52.249 --> 01:31:58.179
See as we will because a lot of people were very displeased with the TM plus they know it was an absolute ripoff

01:31:59.209 --> 01:32:02.079
Now what you can do is to talk to them that

01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:05.119
You see

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:09.788
this is the thing this month this Kundalini is here this thing that

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.749
But a mantra unless and until it is awakened

01:32:14.809 --> 01:32:16.809
By a realized soul is relatives

01:32:16.809 --> 01:32:21.759
This is you must write this stage has to awaken mistake you like that you can tell them the preparing

01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:26.499
but it is to be awakened and this should happen to a person and if it happens and

01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:29.169
Then if it has I mean when we have the publicly

01:32:33.559 --> 01:32:35.559
What do you do that

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.240
I'm in

01:32:43.410 --> 01:32:46.129
The how do you say these people won't come to the publicity

01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:50.150
These people won't come to the public meeting

01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:04.789
How do you stop them coming to the public meeting well

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:11.150
Then what can you do?

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:23.300
That was the point we open our service is that lecturers free

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.779
but other education institute will charge people to come under force or

01:33:44.999 --> 01:33:48.708
If we can say to them that the public meetings are in

01:33:55.829 --> 01:33:58.429
How many people come for public meetings you writer

01:34:03.749 --> 01:34:06.289
And how many will be coming for your course

01:34:09.599 --> 01:34:12.649
I know the mother charging mother TM experience

01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:22.339
Now the public meeting of these 20 people is always twenties it they don't increase

01:34:28.889 --> 01:34:33.739
So let us not have it as a public meeting there you are

01:34:45.749 --> 01:34:49.369
See I would say this one you started -

01:34:57.689 --> 01:35:01.489
So it would be so why do you have any public meeting at all?

01:35:01.489 --> 01:35:07.728
Why I am saying for these twenty sweet sweet if they have a big party, what you can do is to have them in Dodgeville

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:11.209
And he's not advertised

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.900
Let us see that what sound better

01:35:16.289 --> 01:35:19.279
If only 2-3 people are coming every week you see

01:35:20.010 --> 01:35:22.249
Supposing they get about fifty people for this

01:35:23.039 --> 01:35:25.039
Kind of a training center

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.210
Then best thing would be that they should go for the training center

01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:38.299
And you should have your thing in - from now. You've got an actor just like as you have here

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:50.449
I told somebody else to form

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.760
It's alright feeling from I think young

01:36:29.809 --> 01:36:34.748
Bring me a you keep plate. All right, I'll take it in that Anita because this is too much fun

01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:39.819
Yeah, we'll keep it here. I'll take out immediately. You know that you played turn. Yes. I

01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:42.729
Look so big, but I don't know

01:36:48.409 --> 01:36:50.709
All right, so this is a good idea now

01:36:50.710 --> 01:36:55.929
What we can do is to have this force down there and just like as you are having here

01:36:56.869 --> 01:37:01.899
Because in the public meeting now as you will be busy with Geneva and all that also, isn't it?

01:37:02.809 --> 01:37:08.109
You saw Joe he is 20 or whatever it is. Then we get some people in the ashram we got food there

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.029
So yoga center and is in a public media and let the people come down there

01:37:13.639 --> 01:37:19.509
And also I don't think giving realization so quickly is a good idea. That's what Christine. Peace

01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:24.969
But mother if you give them so quickly they get lost or in my presence is all right

01:37:24.969 --> 01:37:28.989
You can always sit with mothers with the realization is not so they think it's something special

01:37:30.079 --> 01:37:34.808
Otherwise, you know what happens that they think oh, you can give realization. You can user they have no value

01:37:35.059 --> 01:37:40.268
You see because their value system is wrong. First of all. Secondly, they have no sense of relaxation

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:46.630
So better to prepare them for it and then give me you see if you give it to a man man say five powers

01:37:46.749 --> 01:37:48.440
What does it make?

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.440
It's like that

01:38:01.090 --> 01:38:03.659
We practice about nightingale a

01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:08.790
And hopefully I

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.400
win today's

01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:14.550
Wednesday

01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:16.770
When they have this

01:38:38.410 --> 01:38:43.530
Good idea because you see free practice with them they will give you ideas. Literally I

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:47.280
Saw that what you keep. Oh

01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:52.529
Good, I can do that here will be good and everybody can give you ideas

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:03.209
Just taken away the whole food. Oh, I see otherwise, I thought it's either the whole or nothing

01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:14.180
I sometimes don't understand the language of sahaja Yogi's

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:21.170
Thank you, but I would like to have a sponsor all right. Yes too much easy

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:27.589
If I see too much, then I would eat so better bring a small plate that I'll take something. Hmm. Thank you

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:34.070
That's a good idea you practice it here so that will be corrected we know what is

01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:03.499
Now what we can have this golden age one can organize a

01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:10.339
Program inviting people to

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.940
Come

01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:18.440
from all kinds of things and to prepare papers

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.320
and to read them and

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.200
Then the sahaja Yogi's should be in the audience

01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:28.160
And they should ask questions

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.520
with other people

01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:37.250
Here in London, I don't know what they do. That's all

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.460
But

01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.460
They have been organizing

01:40:43.890 --> 01:40:48.379
yoga seminar something inviting people even from India, so

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.570
What we can do for alternative living we can organize one

01:40:54.450 --> 01:40:55.950
and there

01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:59.720
We can get sahaja Yogi's to ask them directly to

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:07.730
These people, and also I sahaja yogi should give a speech who is not a member of this

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.640
secret group you say

01:41:24.079 --> 01:41:26.079
Properly not

01:41:26.599 --> 01:41:34.299
Openly not at all. Not at all, but it can happen openly also in a way because when it will come to sahaja yoga see

01:41:35.210 --> 01:41:38.319
it's so saying that it's a dark night and

01:41:39.110 --> 01:41:44.139
The people from your family are only serving so have it it's like that

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.840
see the dark night nobody sees

01:41:47.929 --> 01:41:51.549
And your family people are serving all the food so you have the best

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.760
like that

01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:06.130
Yes, it is obviously did not or apparently tis not we can say but really it is

01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:12.429
Otherwise, what are we interested in? Not only sahaja yoga, but

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:15.820
saving of people I

01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:22.479
Mean you have tried everything else, isn't it? Laughing?

01:42:27.079 --> 01:42:29.139
Nobody listens first, we are nothing

01:42:47.599 --> 01:42:49.599
Just to be honest, ooh

01:42:56.199 --> 01:43:00.449
And we imagine this college how far we are gone

01:43:05.739 --> 01:43:08.128
And I hope you get that book coming from somewhere

01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.300
Well this some people

01:43:18.639 --> 01:43:20.139
get the

01:43:20.139 --> 01:43:23.578
board, you know when we approach him and we talk about

01:43:24.729 --> 01:43:27.449
religion, of course most people

01:43:28.269 --> 01:43:30.269
Get bored

01:43:33.159 --> 01:43:36.388
Vibrations but some people

01:43:39.429 --> 01:43:41.429
Know as well as

01:43:56.769 --> 01:44:00.119
I can I when the sahaja Yogi's I

01:44:00.639 --> 01:44:05.339
Want to teach Sergio can spread sahaja yoga must undergo an under?

01:44:06.249 --> 01:44:07.449
training

01:44:07.449 --> 01:44:09.989
what to taught how to draw how to honey

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:16.679
Is very important and those 26 lectures that we are going to have your head

01:44:18.249 --> 01:44:21.389
Whenever it is possible, I would also like to come see

01:44:22.059 --> 01:44:27.119
How it works out what what we should talk you have one of these subjects somebody should handle

01:44:27.849 --> 01:44:31.228
How should we talk to people now? Should we begin?

01:44:31.929 --> 01:44:35.578
See, let us understand the master. We have to approach them the way they are

01:45:02.929 --> 01:45:09.518
I mean do whatever made you think proper there's no objection for that, but you have to understand the whole thing

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.979
And talk about that. I should go into that head

01:45:18.829 --> 01:45:20.719
Andy hold a

01:45:20.719 --> 01:45:22.550
picture inside

01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:25.150
And the people are really in a richer condition

01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:33.069
Try whatever is possible that summer work. They're not bothered whether we save them or not. Because how far can you go with them?

01:45:34.099 --> 01:45:35.900
Let them then

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:38.829
Be there with ya. We come up to a point, isn't it?

01:45:40.999 --> 01:45:45.668
Say at the same time if I spend in India because see thousands of humanity

01:45:48.289 --> 01:45:55.779
But here you go on pressing them and asking them for distillery were just on their head standing what to do

01:45:59.179 --> 01:46:01.179
Another can go

01:46:03.769 --> 01:46:05.769
Very insensitive lethargic

01:46:08.389 --> 01:46:10.389
And condition

01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:15.510
These shopping

01:46:17.219 --> 01:46:19.249
The idea mother is

01:46:19.890 --> 01:46:25.279
Is this right that sahaja Yogi's approach seekers, but the golden age

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:31.850
Promotions golden ages. Yeah, not only remove young people who can they are for the track?

01:46:32.489 --> 01:46:34.489
We are for media

01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:39.919
Everything has to be worked out to the making

01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:46.010
That's better

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:53.340
I

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:15.430
Can't you see it's like you see asking a job

01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:20.860
From someone

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.640
Will not oblige people

01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:28.300
But he feels he is obliging you

01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:32.859
Then all the time you with it our God such an obligation like this

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.249
But as a member of this thing

01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:44.319
You can do a lot. I'm sure because otherwise helping or that just trying to oblige you personally

01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:51.230
All the time they'll be

01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:58.419
Having that in your mind. So best thing is just to tell them that actually we are obliging them. I'm not they

01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:02.860
See what

01:48:07.650 --> 01:48:14.779
The hams brother without a surgery jump our mother but these are managing some

01:48:15.929 --> 01:48:17.929
public relations

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.940
when Joshua

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.280
He did your job very well

01:48:22.949 --> 01:48:24.949
right person

01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:57.409
That could be done later on just now we are not to be I need to find a surgeon this one

01:48:58.019 --> 01:49:00.829
But you can say that that's what the sahaja Yogi's say

01:49:02.099 --> 01:49:05.119
what try not that you are certain

01:49:11.729 --> 01:49:18.319
The text we see we just say that we are here as public relations Laura

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:32.929
For alternative systems even further

01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:38.090
Hasn't once

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:41.689
If supposing the Catholic Church want us to help them I

01:49:43.139 --> 01:49:45.139
Have class right now

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:47.300
the important

01:49:47.370 --> 01:49:53.209
The Archbishop's of Canterbury wants to have so much into mine. I'll kill them

01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.940
Stupid people

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.739
Even though we know that he was wrong in many ways

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:34.129
I mean just imagine how stupid their ass. Yeah to allow him to be in the Bible. How is he there?

01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:36.530
What are you gonna find it?

01:50:40.679 --> 01:50:42.679
Best was our

01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:46.050
Archbishop

01:50:46.050 --> 01:50:49.009
They asked him do you believe in this?

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:53.420
In the Immaculate Conception, is it about I'm agnostic

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:01.219
Very honest

01:51:01.409 --> 01:51:08.599
Why are you there? Nobody asking you cannot teach? You cannot answer the questions. And why are you sitting there you get up?

01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:19.220
Exactly said ah

01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:26.959
Somebody asked me well, do you really believe that Phi Sigma said he said, um, I have to have told you already

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.960
Know that nothing for everything

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:38.479
But to him to study the social order or maybe a state of hair, I don't know whatever think about that

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:46.219
More a question of how much violence to get

01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:49.790
Produce Panda how many

01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:54.470
Buildings have got how many birds have got how many bulbs you have got to strengthen

01:51:55.530 --> 01:51:58.639
Its at level crystal it is only that less people

01:51:59.730 --> 01:52:06.830
Are busy counting all the plates in the house all these cups in the house that sort of them. What's a household?

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.760
Charity

01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:34.290
Charity

01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:41.009
Could be a company but we don't have to deal in large financial

01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.530
Basic

01:52:44.530 --> 01:52:47.670
Voluntary system something wasn't to do

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:59.939
Well it a voluntary organization the voluntary arise

01:53:02.530 --> 01:53:04.530
Because for charity we have no money

01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:13.349
Neither we take not give so no question charity goes hand in hand with money, but voluntary work anybody can do

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.520
Voluntary organisation

01:53:20.230 --> 01:53:22.319
Dunno so yoga has no organization

01:53:27.090 --> 01:53:29.090
a

01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:32.249
Partially, I dunno

01:53:33.610 --> 01:53:38.850
Now people do not turn it into my never get stuff

01:53:44.739 --> 01:53:46.739
Well, can I be

01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:55.640
Having secretaries and all that

01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:08.420
I don't think it would be possible

01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:22.830
Hmm now so come to other problems of other problems that you have in

01:54:24.970 --> 01:54:26.970
Gaza

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:30.480
What's the problem with re what happened

01:54:35.890 --> 01:54:37.890
We should

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:42.479
You see what I'm saying, I'm telling you one

01:54:43.330 --> 01:54:45.330
Who were in India?

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.129
now they have got something settle down try to appreciate don't try to

01:54:51.010 --> 01:54:52.450
All right

01:54:52.450 --> 01:54:58.859
No tomorrow somebody comes from Timbuktu now he comes here and then you say you should not be the world. That's not possible

01:54:59.430 --> 01:55:04.709
So if you want to be kind to me just accept Isis order these just now. All right

01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:08.100
now while talking is

01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:10.650
open because I always

01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:14.099
get pestered by one person telling me another thing and under

01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.100
know about make

01:55:18.010 --> 01:55:20.429
People have objection I know that they have

01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:36.150
Hospital or about Kerry and Nick getting together also people have an objection or some sort of

01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:39.510
now that

01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:48.180
Way you will have optician far away, I don't say it's perfect. He must be long she must be hot-tempered in the time talking

01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:53.190
But he's not here to give you realization or me. He's just there to maintain the mobility

01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:59.519
All right, so you don't have to fight with him all the time and say this sea should do that. Usually whatever he's doing

01:56:00.190 --> 01:56:06.359
He's not doing anything to harm. Maybe a little voice there. Definitely. I do not say that. I do not challenge

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.870
There may be some ego something working it out

01:56:10.810 --> 01:56:17.970
But for that you should accept that after all these before this world is staying here in screen is very methodical

01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:19.970
He doesn't give our mother Amy

01:56:21.010 --> 01:56:26.520
For you people you are free in anything because you love but your space you can always develop your spirit

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:29.819
What difference does it make whether you sleep in this room or that way?

01:56:33.130 --> 01:56:38.730
Do not make issues of nonsensical things for sahaja Yogi's does not be do I do like that

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:43.830
Did I ever say that I would like to sleep here or sleep there

01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:55.739
So one thing must understand we are sahaja Yogi's we are not

01:56:56.499 --> 01:57:03.359
Ordinary, we have to behave like safe how much the states bear what how do we know say by the way?

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:09.389
They are bearing power. They are preparing power the way they are simple the way they are

01:57:10.209 --> 01:57:13.079
Living with less things the way they are sacrificing

01:57:14.679 --> 01:57:18.058
We are Saints and I don't know what sort of things

01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:29.310
All right, I agree even if I say that technique is dominating or if doing something like that, all right

01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:32.790
Let's somebody organize

01:57:34.690 --> 01:57:39.210
Like that will not allow anybody to be organizing if everybody has a say in the matter

01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:45.930
How is it going to work out? But your babies they're absolutely free if you want to enjoy the freedom

01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:54.930
Wherever you are whatever movement wherever you stay if you are free people

01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:58.349
You will not create problems those who are not free with it wrong. It's the simplest

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.640
So no more following on this point, I want to stay in this room and that it's too frivolous and not to involve me

01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:07.859
It's not so if I am always involved

01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:14.969
So take everything for granted if you don't want to diminish them you can go away

01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:20.459
But now let it go on don't give me a headache you have too many things to do

01:58:21.850 --> 01:58:23.670
So nobody should give me a headache

01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:30.600
When I find Nick his absolute uses are some dares to do but I'm sure when the others that person comes same probably

01:58:31.630 --> 01:58:34.770
because your evils are there and if Nick is

01:58:36.190 --> 01:58:40.560
Organizing you think that is something greater than you. That's the problem. No, not at all

01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:45.809
You might be a much greater residue be than he is much greater

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:49.259
But he's the one who as time is doing the job. It's all right children

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:53.250
Why do you interfere you easy job. I'm not talking about you or any

01:58:54.219 --> 01:58:58.529
Maybe that you're right. I have not seen you are not maybe you're right. Maybe tell

01:58:59.590 --> 01:59:03.840
But I am told that some people in the ashram believe that there should be no overriding

01:59:05.170 --> 01:59:07.350
About living together. We are not reached that stage

01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:17.880
You have not reached that stage when you reach that stage where you don't need any organisation like these leaves are simple they don't need

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:21.029
they grow according to the laws of

01:59:23.449 --> 01:59:26.138
Who they dominate and who they trouble anybody

01:59:28.159 --> 01:59:33.878
But when you become that loudly in the spirit in your father's domain

01:59:34.219 --> 01:59:39.128
Then you don't know how beautiful you there won't be any problem between each other

01:59:39.559 --> 01:59:43.719
Now supposing say somebody said X is very good and the Y's will be back

01:59:44.269 --> 01:59:46.989
Til it is not alright, the Y has to be. All right

01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:54.249
The X should not be satisfied with what he has got see something really should not Y has to be. All right also

01:59:55.489 --> 02:00:02.918
So what he has to do is to pray for you meeting with you what you want, but you cannot just say that oh

02:00:02.919 --> 02:00:06.009
I am very good. The other one is no that's not the way sahaja yoga

02:00:07.909 --> 02:00:13.118
Everybody now say my finger is safe. I won't say cut off my finger. That's all right

02:00:13.159 --> 02:00:16.509
I'll try to improve we try to save as much as possible. So

02:00:18.439 --> 02:00:23.108
That relationship will only develop if you really work out in that way

02:00:23.299 --> 02:00:25.929
but if you don't want to work out that present there will be

02:00:29.929 --> 02:00:32.078
No more angles no more than personal

02:00:33.139 --> 02:00:37.838
Now try to quiet in yourself and be peaceful ashram has to be a place of peace

02:00:38.539 --> 02:00:40.539
Where peace should decide?

02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:44.349
God has been so kind to me. Just imagine you are living under such a rule

02:00:44.349 --> 02:00:50.858
I can't even think of such a thing in modern times. What a beautiful thing. They have done here. Just look at this

02:00:51.619 --> 02:00:57.938
Have you ever noticed what God has given you to be under this roof? So beautifully done for

02:00:59.389 --> 02:01:01.389
such a beautiful

02:01:01.879 --> 02:01:03.879
count your blessings

02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:08.109
If this is important

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.869
When you are a realized soul you see nothing but we clear out

02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:21.679
And then you give you if you give ugliness then you are not a sahaja yogi. Yes here to better improve yourself

02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:23.870
Why are you talking?

02:01:24.630 --> 02:01:28.430
And Nick is not the last one so it is not maybe the first one

02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:33.230
But he is the one who was available, which is good at organizing

02:01:33.230 --> 02:01:36.080
So I asked him to ominous now you both all of you give you my dear

02:01:37.170 --> 02:01:42.050
Other words every moment you do something you shall give up. Will you take up from him? Mr. Harry? All right

02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.530
So that nobody why I am just telling you because just now the problem came from me

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.649
But you are not the first one. This is that I think the eleventh you

02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:58.579
So now as he is doing if you are all busy people let me

02:02:02.250 --> 02:02:07.970
Let you meet the baby is doing it just listen to me nothing important what is important in your spirit, isn't it?

02:02:11.850 --> 02:02:15.379
Keep your attention on to your spirit and not to these realities

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:21.919
And I tell you I have seen in the West people just are trying to find ways and methods of colony. Really

02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:26.900
as a meat connoisseur, you follow both of this just the same thing, but

02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:30.890
it's only just to find something if your

02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:42.140
Father did not do it. Then your grandfather was different like sort of a thing you it's very back tension and very bad attitude

02:02:43.770 --> 02:02:49.790
Towards each other not of mirth and happiness enjoy and understand and enjoy

02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:52.460
That time more to be free furniture

02:02:57.830 --> 02:03:00.020
Um when we go back to New York

02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:08.630
We're going to try to get an optional bed and I was wondering I'm treating you so hard here any amount of time

02:03:08.630 --> 02:03:10.630
I've been here

02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:19.370
I'll give you two the laughington if they get an extra in New York. Maybe you live there

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:24.380
Thank you very much thank you, huh. We watch your baby

02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.720
So

02:03:33.850 --> 02:03:35.970
What is the future what did he say the last

02:03:42.130 --> 02:03:44.130
Nobody's going to leave that

02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:54.509
All right, why not everyone you see some new ones are better than the very old ones are similar

02:03:57.340 --> 02:04:04.349
Sometimes they can act like snakes and either they take it for granted. They think I don't understand

02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:22.200
You old all these things do not exist in sahaja yoga as long as you love me your aura

02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.360
Also this idea more than

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.840
Better get rid of it

02:04:38.630 --> 02:04:41.739
26 weeks are sufficient to

02:04:43.159 --> 02:04:44.989
make you

02:04:44.989 --> 02:04:52.239
if you are one day sahaja, yogi are already old now, but if you are amico then are when you old

02:04:54.079 --> 02:04:59.679
And then if you are three weeks on then you are absolutely mature fool fool

02:05:01.909 --> 02:05:05.409
You don't need more than three weeks to be a real sahaja yoga

02:05:06.889 --> 02:05:09.489
Some of them just get a split of a second

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:15.369
Yes, what is it don't kill you rates, yes

02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.700
Yes

02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:33.870
What is

02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:43.469
Chaya water husband's ethnic are those for sceptile logo so many covergirl

02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:46.860
artists

02:05:47.230 --> 02:05:49.230
Westminister people to send by

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:52.140
letters to me

02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:58.169
48 Brompton square, huh? That's why I said you could be her. I don't know how much money is there. Nothing

02:05:58.170 --> 02:06:02.910
It's all going to him a channel who is collecting money for traveling. Is there anyone

02:06:05.949 --> 02:06:09.149
Bugged on McDon you are putting in Westminister things

02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:15.060
All right, is he getting the reports from there

02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:24.599
So dad to me so you please ask him to send that 248 dr. Square because I would like to say

02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:31.080
Known as a media

02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:41.009
Moon a cheese coach or did you Macario city bank follow sacado?

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:45.000
Information very fast. We need to come up your high cabbage. I am no idea

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:50.459
You gave me just to check good, but I think I can also write isn't it?

02:06:51.429 --> 02:06:53.429
the bank

02:06:53.739 --> 02:06:58.829
All right knowing if you make the letter I decided let us send it to him and get it

02:06:58.830 --> 02:07:01.109
You see because I have no idea how much money is there

02:07:01.690 --> 02:07:03.550
You took some money out

02:07:03.550 --> 02:07:08.940
For our traveling a little bit and I don't know whether they have returned it or not. I don't know

02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.940
I guess it does happen about

02:07:16.530 --> 02:07:19.609
Also Bank, people are funny if you don't take the accounts immediately

02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:24.620
They don't give you and if you ask them, they'll say alright, you give us money for that

02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:30.680
And also it's quite confusing isn't it? So best thing is to keep day-to-day account is the vector

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:34.010
It's happened with some another backpack are

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.950
See first it was sent to

02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:39.620
Ashley Gardens

02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:44.630
Now that's sending it to me regards ARCA

02:07:48.330 --> 02:07:53.510
Kalyan second opted chili there and the Govan will also write I will I will sign them so

02:07:56.730 --> 02:07:59.720
I can concern Pathan because I don't know what to do

02:08:05.610 --> 02:08:07.610
No, whatever

02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:13.880
How am I going to Scotland

02:08:21.030 --> 02:08:23.689
But then what about any car there

02:08:27.810 --> 02:08:29.810
a

02:08:30.810 --> 02:08:32.810
Police might find out from field

02:08:33.180 --> 02:08:39.799
Whatever money or John here, you'll need it for their expenses, whatever have things because they're still you

02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:42.350
Never got a job

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:45.109
Who else was Macallan wanted to go there?

02:08:51.450 --> 02:08:57.589
Susan wanted to come but I thought for the time being that is the beginning so I mean

02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:06.119
I think you should little bit look after that more time, you know, whatever it is

02:09:07.210 --> 02:09:10.919
Now would you like somebody to go down to talk to the media people? They're

02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:26.070
Interested would then you

02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:45.900
Yes, Brian should be taken help up. He will give you all the idea. We just wanna live forever

02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:52.679
That's very important. That's your job isn't to see to it that you form this organization. You see how they shine

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.579
This is yours. You must keep the otherwise. There will be a problem

02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:02.759
Now what's happening about you Harry you bring me over

02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:10.830
Can anybody give him a job temporarily we got

02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:28.619
Beautifully, what is it it should be a good job and what did

02:10:30.610 --> 02:10:32.610
Not be a permanent

02:10:33.610 --> 02:10:35.610
You need not be a permanent

02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:42.240
But supposing it is not that

02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:53.849
What somebody said that if she can't cover the tourist year she can get married here and then they would not object

02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:07.139
So the provision here, I'd appreciate a vision about thorough

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:13.920
Interview there so they will meet you. So if she was approaching now for that

02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:33.159
In order to talk to the people you who had employed in that you give us some fear now

02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:36.369
You won't talk. Somebody should won't talk for you

02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:53.349
That's the best way to avoid the person come back to me Nietzsche never come back you take somebody with you you can talk

02:11:59.690 --> 02:12:01.839
Anybody who should say that to see her

02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:06.849
For the guarantee of this bad thing, I'm a little

02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:15.159
Discouraging landed on we can ask the next to give you a job temper already coming

02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:32.139
But he can just offer him a job or something

02:12:39.159 --> 02:12:41.579
Be better able to joke with John Fulton

02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:49.560
From reading because I think John is trying to sell the company or something. And also it's more in keeping with this modification

02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:52.860
Why not try again?

02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:04.260
Alright

02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:13.139
Good idea alright to talk to you is very responsive as possible. Alright, that's done that

02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:19.259
Any other problem? Well, I've been living here for two weeks and

02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:25.080
Since I've been here with meditation in the morning hasn't been on time I talk to

02:13:26.199 --> 02:13:28.229
others about it and I haven't gotten

02:13:28.929 --> 02:13:32.339
satisfactory answers and just say that people don't get up and

02:13:33.219 --> 02:13:37.589
Don't understand why or how to correct it what happen?

02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:43.109
You don't turn this time what I don't understand why it isn't on

02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:52.799
You're not getting the vibration no meditation doesn't start on time

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:57.059
All right. He did all these Lots

02:14:00.090 --> 02:14:04.429
Where are they lost all English lost their tail courts have gone but still the boxes

02:14:09.929 --> 02:14:12.259
I have patients. We also have patients

02:14:16.530 --> 02:14:18.530
They're all not see

02:14:20.730 --> 02:14:22.730
Morse ladies

02:14:23.850 --> 02:14:25.850
And gentlemen

02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:28.510
With lots of object

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.279
Stay like that lords ladies and gentlemen, I

02:14:42.929 --> 02:14:45.469
Know in the language they're called lots of

02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:51.440
Nuts up. So even if somebody is lethargic person says a large table is sleeping still

02:14:52.770 --> 02:14:54.770
leave India

02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:59.429
We are not

02:14:59.429 --> 02:15:02.509
4 o clock program was really very symbolic

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:09.049
See to give the program at 4 o clock in the morning. He must have said that in sahaja, yoga you have to get

02:15:14.159 --> 02:15:16.159
This awesome body

02:15:17.610 --> 02:15:23.029
Now you must try to keep certain discipline with yourself I said you beat Iran equal to yourself

02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:27.860
Nichiren that's only way. Can you open the window?

02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:33.049
When I called you lots I really tell you are all angry because to become hot

02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:47.090
It's not a easy thing to be realized and it's not an easy thing to be established as a resource, I must say

02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:50.600
We have to really work

02:15:51.659 --> 02:15:54.859
Physical mental emotional hangs up

02:15:57.540 --> 02:16:01.729
This is only physical my child, but they have other souls

02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:07.189
And you are do know how one has to manage that. Thank you very much

02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:10.550
She's come along

02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:18.860
Growing taller

02:16:41.489 --> 02:16:42.809
Mother

02:16:42.809 --> 02:16:48.738
About television story from Australia about the media. It's tender would I be?

02:16:49.469 --> 02:16:51.059
you were

02:16:51.059 --> 02:16:53.059
Reminded that we were in Melbourne

02:16:53.939 --> 02:16:55.939
and I

02:16:56.340 --> 02:17:02.929
Asked you or we asked you if you would come down very early one day take a very early flight, so

02:17:03.779 --> 02:17:07.668
that you would be available for the press and for

02:17:08.459 --> 02:17:10.459
television

02:17:11.519 --> 02:17:14.269
Two of us travel down the day before and

02:17:15.209 --> 02:17:20.869
handed out a lot of press reports to the television channel and

02:17:22.050 --> 02:17:24.050
to the newspapers

02:17:25.139 --> 02:17:31.998
We'd already had a couple of articles in the newspapers, but we had nothing home television in Melbourne. I

02:17:35.039 --> 02:17:41.208
Had to meet you Barry I think with something like the plane arrived at 8:00 in the morning so it must have left that

02:17:42.179 --> 02:17:44.898
You must have been at the airport since sooner after 6:00

02:17:45.779 --> 02:17:47.899
And I had lived a final Club

02:17:48.689 --> 02:17:52.038
Nice to meet you in telling that nothing had been lined up

02:17:53.129 --> 02:17:54.779
but your day

02:17:54.779 --> 02:17:57.439
Looked like being completely wasted one

02:17:58.979 --> 02:18:05.568
You didn't question as to who I contacted and I explained that

02:18:07.319 --> 02:18:09.269
I've been to

02:18:09.269 --> 02:18:11.269
two of the television channels

02:18:11.729 --> 02:18:14.479
Had taken the program from Sydney

02:18:15.090 --> 02:18:17.749
so they weren't interested anymore and

02:18:18.869 --> 02:18:22.519
The other two I had to bring back

02:18:25.109 --> 02:18:27.109
As to whether they were

02:18:28.349 --> 02:18:30.209
Would

02:18:30.209 --> 02:18:32.209
Do an item

02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:36.719
So you were very gracious and went off to the house

02:18:38.559 --> 02:18:42.329
The felon in the house was out of order and

02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:47.159
So I had to get out in the car and burn my fan box

02:18:48.130 --> 02:18:51.839
It was about the fourth fifth or even perhaps six red box

02:18:53.229 --> 02:18:55.229
Wasn't broken

02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.429
When eventually I got through to Channel seven I

02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:04.559
Was told by the girl that I've spoken to the day before

02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:08.489
That oh, I found it. Just the right time

02:19:09.309 --> 02:19:11.080
because

02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:14.940
she just come in and she was going out again and

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:22.710
Yes, they would be interested in doing a news item and interviewing news

02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:25.440
Where would that be?

02:19:27.070 --> 02:19:32.400
Immediately inventing I said pop we meet in the park. It was a beautiful day. So

02:19:33.849 --> 02:19:37.079
Then I had to go back and I already had to make time as well

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:42.059
And this is something I've never done like so I found myself admitting you to

02:19:42.729 --> 02:19:44.110
an interview

02:19:44.110 --> 02:19:51.089
At half-past twelve in a park in the middle of the city about 15 miles from where you were

02:19:52.479 --> 02:19:54.479
So I was like this

02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:01.620
And when I explained to you you said

02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:07.619
You looked so disappointed this morning we had to do something

02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:21.150
And it was a very wonderful interview extremely relaxed and nice you see

02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:30.090
It depends on your state of mind listen to me if I'm here like, that's all

02:20:32.229 --> 02:20:34.229
I'm here. That's

02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:36.990
me does not matter whether I have to

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:41.940
Have something or to read something that doesn't matter to me at all

02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:44.820
Jean I'm here at this point

02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:48.780
I've come as your mother. I have to give realization to you

02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:52.920
How I do it

02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:55.740
That have you doing

02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:59.219
So I don't have to worry as to how I do it

02:20:59.890 --> 02:21:04.979
When I had faced the problem supposing somebody comes before me he is what vibrations or something I woke up

02:21:05.770 --> 02:21:10.950
But it does not matter with me if he doesn't get realization. I don't get upset myself

02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:15.269
neither I upset that for another person because if I get upset

02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:19.380
He'll be much more upset agree that if mother is upset with me when am I going to get realization of it?

02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:22.740
So that will be much more upsetting

02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:26.969
But it's not rational with me it's my nature I

02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:31.619
Am completely at peace with myself. I have no problem. I am NOT disappointed

02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:34.260
nothing

02:21:35.650 --> 02:21:38.489
Perhaps there's only one thing that upsets me really

02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:44.160
There's anything that really upsets me is I find that there is no pure love between you

02:21:45.490 --> 02:21:51.299
That love is not felt that you are not enjoying the love. You see doesn't matter anything you do, but you love each other

02:21:52.450 --> 02:21:55.019
That's very important because that's most pleasing

02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:58.709
But loving doesn't mean some sort of a

02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:05.370
Nonsense, you people know about that's not the thing. Love is a feeling of wonder of unique

02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:08.280
or being see

02:22:11.229 --> 02:22:13.229
Like Jamel once told me

02:22:13.479 --> 02:22:15.479
He came down to Bombay

02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:17.550
and he was very seriously even

02:22:18.610 --> 02:22:23.459
More venomous he came down to London now London is not his place nothing of the time

02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:26.490
As soon as he came to he threw he felt he belongs

02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:33.390
basically, and he got all right, and it person and II wanted to meet everyone everybody wanted to

02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:36.870
That's one of the things

02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:41.549
You are almost people who have not found each other

02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:48.719
After so many years of searching for might create problems among yourself nothing at all

02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:51.720
the rest I look after you just

02:22:53.530 --> 02:22:56.879
Now for the other people like the media's we seem that

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:06.570
You're trying hard my blessings are with you but also it's not yours. Oh you don't have to worry if he does become

02:23:07.210 --> 02:23:12.479
Alright, we worked that's all karma, Nevada Cara your job is to work happily

02:23:13.330 --> 02:23:15.330
stay when you

02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:20.910
You will not just so you will not sort of be a speedier will not be lethargic

02:23:20.979 --> 02:23:26.249
Nothing, if you stay in the center your speed will be so well balanced that you will not hit anyone

02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:29.849
But you and everything will move

02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:35.939
The relationship has to be established to say see, you know tardivo

02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:40.740
the relationship with the be the relationship with the switch relationship with

02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:43.330
clutch and

02:23:43.330 --> 02:23:45.929
With the accelerator legs and all these things

02:23:47.439 --> 02:23:53.408
Loretta's everywhere is fixed like that. You see and you move with them supposing they all start moving in different direction

02:23:54.649 --> 02:23:56.649
what will have

02:23:57.619 --> 02:23:59.619
First establish your relationship

02:23:59.630 --> 02:24:01.689
That's very important. I be telling you

02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:06.670
That's first thing and foremost thing is to establish your relations. Alright?

02:24:07.489 --> 02:24:11.288
With outsiders and much with outsiders. There's no problem

02:24:11.810 --> 02:24:14.499
Because you see they are not interested. Why should you worry now?

02:24:14.499 --> 02:24:19.449
This thing may have formed it's really because we would like to drop with them a little bit. I

02:24:20.390 --> 02:24:24.880
Don't know. How many will be sent with this. I don't know. Let's see, but it's a big joke

02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:27.039
No, you have to play with them. Let's see

02:24:30.289 --> 02:24:32.209
See

02:24:32.209 --> 02:24:34.209
Creation is not if you are

02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.420
Making any one beings are not

02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:42.879
But making sahaja Yogi's averse difficult. It's the most difference

02:24:44.329 --> 02:24:48.669
You have been made Yogi's in the sense. You have got realization. That's over circle

02:24:50.359 --> 02:24:52.359
Make coups are Yogi's is not easy

02:24:53.749 --> 02:24:59.529
So prophet and the prophet work has to be done with peace with understanding

02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:08.380
Sometimes I really also for my irritation at things because and I find that you are so effective but at

02:25:10.069 --> 02:25:17.679
The stage where we are now, I feel quite happy in confidence somehow I had a feeling that there's not so much

02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:28.960
Distrust and domination now with in sahaja yoga. It's not so bad

02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:36.999
Once it is established. I have nothing to worry about see we have to be a solid

02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:41.019
Personality once we have that we manage

02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:47.920
We manage everything no doubt we can't meet

02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:53.300
But first this is one of the many big things we have done

02:25:54.090 --> 02:25:58.520
And moreover to see the master people have a very great response. I

02:25:59.070 --> 02:26:05.209
Can get thousands of them in English. But today we have to fight the intellectuals we have to fight

02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:08.030
against it we have to fight the

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:13.010
Country see the big people so far with them

02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:15.780
these emotional people

02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:18.049
the people of Syria who are

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:20.720
emotionally bound who are emotionally higher

02:26:22.170 --> 02:26:24.170
verified

02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:27.590
Imagine that a person

02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:33.259
Like say Dumas meets your president. He will just say the madman

02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:36.469
Were you making me talk to eat with you? Just give him up?

02:26:37.290 --> 02:26:41.059
He just said this magnet why have you brought me to talk to this? Madman?

02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:47.450
That's all the male journalist but back at work, but an intellectual will know because he has gone through all that madness so he knows

02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:56.119
It's only he can retrace him back not too much the one will just say what this mad move a madman

02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:58.150
That's all we've done many times like this

02:27:01.050 --> 02:27:02.670
That's fine

02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:06.020
because if you have to save these people then we have to have very

02:27:06.930 --> 02:27:08.930
Good. Sahaja, Yogi's you realize

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:12.889
You have problems all those are them they have to be worked out

02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:16.070
But develop certain of God

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:19.370
habits is one of them means father is very peaceful, but

02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:24.499
Pace is not fast. She doesn't jostle people

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:32.129
Try to become a condom

02:27:38.369 --> 02:27:42.798
And that's only possible when you are solidly holding each other's hands

02:27:45.209 --> 02:27:47.209
Then there is no

02:27:47.789 --> 02:27:50.838
Agility or agitation or just

02:28:00.359 --> 02:28:02.928
Pick me up from what?

02:28:05.459 --> 02:28:10.729
I forgot I thought some policeman is going to pick me up on

02:28:13.499 --> 02:28:15.499
Making cut

02:28:18.509 --> 02:28:20.509
Are we can somebody can drop me?

02:28:23.009 --> 02:28:23.969
All right

02:28:23.969 --> 02:28:28.339
Somebody can drop me let it be because he come on the way and then who is better when you drop me there

02:28:28.409 --> 02:28:30.409
Are you going that side?

02:28:30.569 --> 02:28:32.569
all right, so

02:28:34.169 --> 02:28:36.169
What's the other thing

02:28:36.359 --> 02:28:38.359
How do you teach?

02:28:46.449 --> 02:28:48.449
You take a pain and functionary

02:28:51.529 --> 02:28:56.679
You just talk to them and tell them not how you achieved you see mostly their media they have media copy

02:28:57.319 --> 02:28:59.918
They are not intelligent bright people, you know mediocre

02:29:01.850 --> 02:29:06.279
Absolutely worried about the wants of people you see must have if somebody has a car

02:29:06.279 --> 02:29:11.529
You must also have a car if somebody has these you must have this sort of very know them

02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:14.590
What can you talk?

02:29:19.570 --> 02:29:22.880
Because to talk to their level a victim

02:29:24.350 --> 02:29:29.050
They're themselves will come one day to sahaja yoga because not easy to have pointing somewhere. It's

02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:31.840
Very low level

02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:37.420
I think the lowest level people go to quality sent it to parties because they think they are more significantly like they're useless

02:29:37.970 --> 02:29:42.939
So they think that's the best place to go and show your significance. I tell you the Richard is people do that

02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:46.330
And those who are good people will never outshine. I

02:29:48.439 --> 02:29:51.398
Mean I've heard your politicians, I don't tell you much of that

02:29:54.890 --> 02:29:56.890
No, no

02:29:57.410 --> 02:30:00.279
They will just have jokes about

02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:07.779
Now a Queen's party works out sort of thing up nothing serious I

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:13.299
Think then it's no connection between them and reality

02:30:14.239 --> 02:30:18.759
They don't know then they will never experience tightly what they're talking about

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:24.100
Even the Socialists when they talk about this and that they are not known forward

02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:30.910
They don't what are the plans of our time just they're talking us to make a business out of it. That's

02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:35.739
If you ask them give your one-fourth to somebody we like it

02:30:37.970 --> 02:30:42.550
You have to be extremely generous and compassionate to be associated step one of them

02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:50.800
It sell you self-appointed business is you get more how to get more is saying that thing and then do what bring?

02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:59.169
What get boots in the house invite them feed them? What do they need money?

02:31:01.489 --> 02:31:05.229
Everything is money oriented and absolutely low level very low level

02:31:06.770 --> 02:31:11.950
You see food listen to the news especially in England, I don't know what they do another country

02:31:13.220 --> 02:31:19.450
Then you strike one thing then the founders gonna come down. The dollar has gone and comes out

02:31:20.390 --> 02:31:26.649
Gold prices or they are asking for so many percentage higher they are asking for so much positive

02:31:26.649 --> 02:31:29.439
I think there was you losing country. I'm sure

02:31:30.109 --> 02:31:33.369
The way they are fighting I mean nothing is for cents in whatever

02:31:34.729 --> 02:31:39.859
Half of the losses that 10% child 15 person for what?

02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:54.980
And that too they're so miserly whatever money they have they don't put into something fanciful at the most

02:31:59.730 --> 02:32:04.789
You won't even find their nice teeth up with these not even one nice

02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:10.640
Teeth why you our industries are going down because nobody wants to buy with you. Only thing that we go up is

02:32:11.610 --> 02:32:13.610
Whiskey or something like that

02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:18.500
There's no cultural

02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:30.790
Look at this

02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:43.720
I'm with some of your readers a surprise that I am a happy person

02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:54.969
You know, they're unhappy people make everyone unhappy

02:32:56.900 --> 02:33:01.089
Those who take to politics are mostly very low type of thing very low mentality

02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:07.330
They're good for nothing useless people you want to show that's all or my opinion is I draw

02:33:11.690 --> 02:33:14.409
When it comes to sacrifices they cannot

02:33:16.101 --> 02:33:18.101
They make everyone find

02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:20.950
do all kinds of bad things that

02:33:22.010 --> 02:33:25.270
Take advantage unions. They what are give the Union Street

02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:31.870
Spoiling everybody's lives in ideas. Why don't I teach that? You should not drink what could have they done to people?

02:33:34.580 --> 02:33:37.780
Labor class you. Just tell them not to bring that first English

02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:50.409
Stop all the for the cops fatality was a real politician. I should say he went all out to stop all the

02:33:51.739 --> 02:33:56.948
shops of wine and other trace in all

02:33:59.330 --> 02:34:02.409
Then he stopped people buying foreign foods

02:34:04.819 --> 02:34:09.579
Hand-woven hands, but everybody should wear whether you are a minister or anything. So a

02:34:11.390 --> 02:34:14.109
Poor man can wear the same dress or the minister can bet

02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:21.309
All kinds of things he tried

02:34:21.979 --> 02:34:23.420
from a

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:29.049
Will be pointed there who they are not for you anything at all because they have no sense at all of anything

02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:32.080
What tissues are no?

02:34:36.729 --> 02:34:42.209
Don't have to be enlightened but how many politicians will take to sahaja yoga? Can we kick up even wha?

02:34:53.530 --> 02:34:55.530
What did you say

02:35:00.189 --> 02:35:05.819
That question of tricky see the thing is they will never even see they haven't got intelligence to see

02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:08.880
That there is something beyond

02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:18.120
Apart from tricking some may be good also, but they are not able to see that they have to go beyond these

02:35:19.210 --> 02:35:22.349
So they may know what is research. It is not meant for TV. I

02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:29.160
Don't think of any any one of them we take decided you are saying David

02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:34.290
what's-his-name's they will speed steel take

02:35:36.130 --> 02:35:38.130
I

02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:44.370
Hope you take this on you know elections in sahaja yoga

02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:59.889
It's again so being a low-level

02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:12.720
I wish they could take to sahaja. Yoga would have spread much more no doubt, but they won't

02:36:14.561 --> 02:36:20.010
Not a difficulty so should we go now? All right

02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:30.870
All right, you have a program tonight yes, what is it

02:36:42.130 --> 02:36:48.910
I don't know gummy knows better than me. When can I go but I would say it's a hot country or a cold country

02:36:51.530 --> 02:36:53.530
It's a wet country

02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:00.940
When does brain

02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:11.440
I don't know. You just can't see yourself

02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:19.480
And let me know whenever you say we do you could ask them in when actually I don't know I

02:37:19.851 --> 02:37:23.170
Can do it 43 days or four days. This makes no difference to me

02:37:23.561 --> 02:37:28.480
The only thing is this it should not be something all the way I go and let you can work out with me. Oh

02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:32.500
How are you

02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:34.660
Are you going back?

02:37:37.761 --> 02:37:39.290
Reading

02:37:39.290 --> 02:37:41.210
Why you what happened?

02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:43.210
Other job in the RV is finished

02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:49.659
And David starts working and brightening John Wayne October 1st of October

02:37:49.971 --> 02:37:56.170
So we have a few weeks in London. So you are enjoying your holidays. Please come to Geneva with me

02:37:56.900 --> 02:38:04.300

02:38:05.931 --> 02:38:08.590
Basel near the house. We cannot stay there

02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:12.280
You have any other plans

02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:28.000
And it was left by mistake in Derbyshire so we kept it only for my

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:31.900
Dog this year

02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:36.021
I

02:38:36.021 --> 02:38:38.050
don't know where she got it and

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:43.390
the canals really have asked me to thank you very much for all that you've done and

02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:47.140
And other than one time she's asked me to tell you that

02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:51.489
Now you are leaving London is good. And then if you can come

02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:54.850
I mean, I've got my passport I give you

02:39:01.381 --> 02:39:03.381
You're looking oh, right

02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:13.520
So

02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:22.839
They told me I had another one

02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:33.790
So now I

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:47.920
Going to

02:40:02.779 --> 02:40:04.399
Return tomorrow

02:40:04.399 --> 02:40:09.189
Because you see fast we've done the puja I can go for houses different points

02:40:09.189 --> 02:40:14.679
But what I'm saying that I've done at these are there for these people requires. It's a runt

02:40:19.850 --> 02:40:23.109
No, so what time is the programs I'm going to block?

02:40:26.659 --> 02:40:33.399
All right, so I'll be there at 7:00 you start it off what is that

02:40:43.039 --> 02:40:45.039
Yes, yes, I was wondering that

02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:02.580
Romania John

02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:24.809
These were the stands for that

02:41:24.810 --> 02:41:30.149
There's a blue cobalt players with the gold on them from Hampstead

02:41:30.729 --> 02:41:36.688
Yes, it says on these stands for more for welding the placement even put the plates on

02:41:38.439 --> 02:41:43.648
But I wanted to have the exact name because these my husband liked it very much anything

02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:48.450
You could bite every month or somehow whether the paint find out

02:41:49.479 --> 02:41:51.479
Beautiful they make it themselves

02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:53.580
well, I they sell it with the

02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:58.229
And the truck also can be put

02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:14.580
That's the kind of what I've seen but

02:42:46.090 --> 02:42:48.090
Thank you very much we tied up good

02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:02.339
It's nice man because you've been working so hard all night working

02:43:06.580 --> 02:43:09.570
It's holily this work is all the doctors

02:43:10.391 --> 02:43:11.561
and

02:43:11.561 --> 02:43:14.580
hospitals man the Ironman infinity comic himself

02:43:15.311 --> 02:43:20.130
Perhaps work at 19. So I think it's good. I think that means now

02:43:21.221 --> 02:43:22.511
it's

02:43:22.511 --> 02:43:28.380
There aren't enough people really it must be because they do have to work too much. It's not a balance

02:43:29.141 --> 02:43:31.590
And we're already too much of writing them

02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:34.230
too much of light you

02:43:34.570 --> 02:43:37.860
Know then somebody take this which is share content

02:43:40.990 --> 02:43:42.990

So may God bless you all. I hope to see you there this evening and be nice so

Hurry, you find out about this job. All right, I'll fix it up

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:16.549
When you have to stop the politics because politicized and let's make more of us

02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:22.429
I think that is one of the things you are catching all the time apart from the left. Sorry Charles Hart here all the time

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
I better not

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:31.040
I

02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:34.070
Hope she'll understand

02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:41.660
There's nothing to follow them

02:45:13.290 --> 02:45:15.740
So she's going to change the world until

02:45:16.890 --> 02:45:21.170
She don't do what it is. It's no one to save the world. They only see the

02:45:22.229 --> 02:45:24.229
Only way now

02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:27.469
Is the only way you won't understand

02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:35.719
She won't understand. You're this. I have to have brains our children. They are not intelligent enough to see that them saving means only

02:45:36.990 --> 02:45:41.719
if socialism comes let them go to socialistic on

02:45:44.430 --> 02:45:50.090
