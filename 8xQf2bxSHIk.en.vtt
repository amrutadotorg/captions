00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:11.820
As you see here on the left hand&nbsp;
side this blue line is there.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.201
This blue line is our power of desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.220
by which we desire, by which God has – supposing&nbsp;
this is the primordial being because God has made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.886
you in His own image – supposing it is&nbsp;
the image of God, then it is His desire.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.140
This power of desire gives you existence, and&nbsp;
when this desire is over, when the Spirit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.480
which is watching the drama of this body, gets&nbsp;
fed up, it disappears, then the death comes in.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.069
This power of desire is the left side.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.720
We call it in Sanskrit as Ida Nadi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.140
also called as the Moon Nadi and&nbsp;
in the Hatha Yoga is the Tha Nadi.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.660
This is the channel, is a subtle channel.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.260
But this gives rise to the gross channel,&nbsp;
which is the left sympathetic nervous system.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.580
Now, doctors don’t believe that left and right&nbsp;
sympathetic nervous systems are two different,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.240
but you will find out yourself&nbsp;
that they are very different.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.920
This looks after our emotional&nbsp;
side, and also beyond this lies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.880
the area which is unknown to us, is&nbsp;
the subconscious; it is unknown to us.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.260
Whatever is unknown is not&nbsp;
God, is not from God’s area.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.000
It is an unknown area, and&nbsp;
beyond that subconscious area,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.762
lies the collective subconscious –&nbsp;
all that has died from our creation.
