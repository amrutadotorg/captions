00:08.181 --> 00:11.820
As you see here on the left hand
side this blue line is there.

00:13.620 --> 00:19.201
This blue line is our power of desire

00:21.120 --> 00:26.220
by which we desire, by which God has – supposing
this is the primordial being because God has made

00:26.220 --> 00:30.886
you in His own image – supposing it is
the image of God, then it is His desire.

00:31.800 --> 00:40.140
This power of desire gives you existence, and
when this desire is over, when the Spirit,

00:40.140 --> 00:48.480
which is watching the drama of this body, gets
fed up, it disappears, then the death comes in.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.069
This power of desire is the left side.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.720
We call it in Sanskrit as Ida Nadi,

00:54.720 --> 01:01.140
also called as the Moon Nadi and
in the Hatha Yoga is the Tha Nadi.

01:01.140 --> 01:03.660
This is the channel, is a subtle channel.

01:03.660 --> 01:10.260
But this gives rise to the gross channel,
which is the left sympathetic nervous system.

01:10.260 --> 01:14.580
Now, doctors don’t believe that left and right
sympathetic nervous systems are two different,

01:14.580 --> 01:18.240
but you will find out yourself
that they are very different.

01:18.240 --> 01:25.920
This looks after our emotional
side, and also beyond this lies

01:25.920 --> 01:29.880
the area which is unknown to us, is
the subconscious; it is unknown to us.

01:29.880 --> 01:34.260
Whatever is unknown is not
God, is not from God’s area.

01:34.860 --> 01:39.000
It is an unknown area, and
beyond that subconscious area,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.762
lies the collective subconscious –
all that has died from our creation.
