1
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:10,680
Now, in this system yesterday
I was telling you about is,

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,200
there are three type of channels you can see
clearly – have you talked about that to them?

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,160
No.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,315
Now, these channels are, the first one is, is
the left-side channel, which is called

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,260
which supplies to the left-side
sympathetic nervous system

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,240
but in Sanskrit language it
is called as the Ida Nadi.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,540
Also it is called as the Moon channel –
is the left-side, which caters to your

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,300
Sub-conscious mind and to
your Collective Sub-conscious.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:54,120
On the right hand side there’s another
area which, we can call it as the

10
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,180
one which nourishes the Right
Sympathetic Nervous System.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,940
This one is for your future.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:16,020
So, we can say that, the left one is
the one, which emits the power of desire

13
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,400
and the right one emits the power of action
through your physical and mental being.

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,540
So, we have these two Sympathetic
Nervous Systems within us.

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,380
In the center is the
Parasympathetic Nervous System

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,020
which in Sanskrit called as the Sushumna Nadi.

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,760
So, the left is the Ida Nadi
which is the Moon channel,

18
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:52,800
left, right is the Pingala Nadi which is the Sun’s
channel and the central one is the Sushumna Nadi

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,060
through which we have now come
to this stage of human awareness.

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,840
From Amoeba to this stage we have arrived
through this system of Parasympathetic activity.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,660
And whatever we have achieved
through our evolution,

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,680
we can feel it on our Central Nervous System.

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,420
For example, if you have some dog or a
animal, any, say a horse, it can

24
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,940
pass through any dirty lane – it doesn’t see
the beauty of a building, it just goes through.

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,891
But it’s only, a human-being can feel the
filth and the dirt and also the beauty.

26
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:38,700
So, in our awareness we have
achieved a lot but still,

27
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,700
there’s something more we have to achieve
and that achievement is, the Absolute Truth.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
So far, whatever truth we have, is all relative.

29
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,100
We’re finding this is nice,
somebody says this is very nice,

30
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,600
somebody says that’s very nice – somebody says
Communism is good somebody says Capitalism is

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,320
good – somebody says this religion is
good, somebody says that religion is

32
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,700
good – it’s all relative terminology,
there’s nothing Absolute about it.

33
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,853
So, whatever is Absolute, we have to
know on our Central Nervous System.

34
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,520
That’s what is called as bodha in
the Buddha religion and

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:26,100
as vid in the Vedas, also what the early
Christians called themselves as Gnostic.

36
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,827
‘Gna’ the word ‘Gna’ comes
from the word ‘Gnya’, ‘Gnya’.

37
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:33,365
Some people call it Gyana,
some people call it Gyan.

38
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,820
So the ‘Gyna’, from the ‘Gyna’ means the one
who has known on the Central Nervous System,

39
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,080
not mentally, not reading something.

40
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,920
It is something that you have to
know on your Central Nervous System.

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,620
And what do you have to know,
is the All-Pervading power,

42
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,778
which is described by all the saints,
prophets and all the Incarnations.

43
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:08,624
You have to feel that subtle power
which works out all that is living.

44
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,680
We cannot explain how it works out.

45
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,440
A little seed sprouts, becomes a big tree

46
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,940
and the tree bears all so many
seeds which has so many trees.

47
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,160
So the one little seed has all the maps

48
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,660
of all the progeny it is going to
produce – it’s a tremendous thing.

49
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,920
And this Infinity, all that is
built-in, in one little seed

50
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:35,280
is like a, something, is beyond our
imagination, beyond our understanding.

51
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:45,000
In the same way, within us lies this very subtle
system, which works out the last ascent.
