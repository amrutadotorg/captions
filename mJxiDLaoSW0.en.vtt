00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:14.237
Now, you see, every puja I give presents
to all the countries who are hosting:

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.955
to all the ladies, all the men,
the leaders.

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:24.380
Only in Guru puja, I’m sorry, I’m not
supposed to give any presents to anyone.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:32.874
It’s a thing when the guru, only, has
to grab everything from you!

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:44.844
All this has to be given only on Guru puja:

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.481
specially the saris, that have been given
to Me,

00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:52.130
are all to be given only during Guru puja.

00:00:52.331 --> 00:01:01.274
But I’m sorry, I can’t give anything
to the leaders or to anyone on this day.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:04.833
I hope you people don’t mind.

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:21.325
To be the guru and to be Mother is a very
difficult thing

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:30.198
because, if you see, the gurus have been
very strict disciplinarians:

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.938
they always try to discipline the disciples
and [be] quite hard with them.

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:41.339
But the mother can’t be that hard, you see.
This is the trouble with the motherhood is!

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.758
That may be one of the reasons that people
take, sometimes, Sahaja Yoga for granted.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.682
But you should not, because you have got
your realisation now.

00:01:53.883 --> 00:01:57.378
Now you are realised-souls, you are
masters,

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.955
so you should look after your ascent.

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:03.235
I don’t have to tell you what [is] to be
done,

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:08.193
because you have the light in your hand
and you can do that very well.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:14.007
I hope today’s lecture, you liked very much
and you don’t mind

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:19.255
if I have said something that might have
upset you a little bit.

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:24.840
But it is a thing [that] one has to see
because we all have to grow

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:30.114
inside and outside and we have to spread
Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:34.468
So we should see everyone - whether
it’s a woman or a man -

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.655
we should see how many people we have
given realisation to.

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:43.324
It’s very important that you should start
giving realisation all over the world.

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:49.007
In this fashion it will spread and I don’t
have to then travel so much

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:52.319
as nowadays I am travelling still.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.316
I think, you all should take it up upon
yourself that you will do,

00:02:57.523 --> 00:03:03.104
at least if not travelling, around your
cities, around in your places of work,

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:07.324
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
openly.

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:11.984
All the blessings are there, all the powers
are there, you can work it out very well.

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:15.687
Anybody you find difficult you give bandhan
and can manage things.

00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:18.785
You know it very well. You know everything
about Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:22.249
so I don’t have to tell you about it.
Only thing: use it!

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.411
Even if you have all the instruments and
if you don’t use it, it won’t work out.

00:03:26.612 --> 00:03:32.224
With all My love, with all My blessings,

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:35.166
I say goodbye now to you, for the time
being.

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:38.161
Thank you.

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:57.440
Guido: Bolo Shri Adi Guru Mata
Shri Nirmala Devi ki! Yogis: Jai!
