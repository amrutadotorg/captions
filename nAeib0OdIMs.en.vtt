00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:47.347
Today we have gathered here to do the Kundalini
Puja or the Adishakti Puja.

00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:54.266
There's a difference between the two.

00:08:54.266 --> 00:09:18.187
Adishakti is the total power of God, of His
desire; while Kundalini

00:09:18.187 --> 00:09:36.707
is the one that is reflected, part, which
is reflected in the human beings as Kundalini.

00:09:36.707 --> 00:09:43.778
So there's a difference between the Adi Kundalini
and the Adishakti.

00:09:43.778 --> 00:10:02.557
Adishakti is the Parashakti, is the power,
which is beyond all the powers, which controls

00:10:02.557 --> 00:10:21.237
all the powers and one of the powers of Adishakti
is Kundalini.

00:10:21.237 --> 00:10:32.727
For example the Kundalini which is placed
within Me in the triangular bone is not totality

00:10:32.727 --> 00:10:35.677
of Me.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:43.766
In the same way the Kundalini, which is placed
within you, is not the totality.

00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:53.796
Of course it is the power, which is there
to give you your self-realization.

00:10:53.796 --> 00:11:06.026
Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes
you, that enlightens your centers.

00:11:06.026 --> 00:11:15.546
But there are two other powers as you know
very powerful, which are working through Ida

00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:27.686
and Pingala and the third one is Mahalakshmi
which is in the center.

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:46.376
Now Kundalini's main job is to give you your
self-realization because She is your individual

00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:49.346
Mother.

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:59.556
Everyone has the Kundalini within himself
or herself reflected whatever maybe the quality

00:11:59.556 --> 00:12:05.067
of that person.

00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:07.616
Now as you see reflections fall on everything.

00:12:07.616 --> 00:12:16.966
Say, the reflection of the Moon falls on the
stone; you don't see any reflection.

00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:29.476
It then falls on a better reflector - say
the water, then we can see the reflection.

00:12:29.476 --> 00:12:42.967
But when it falls on a mirror, which is very
nicely made, say in Belgium, it reflects better.

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:48.817
So that is how the reflection gradually goes
on improving.

00:12:48.817 --> 00:13:00.757
In the same way we have human beings who have
different reflectors but they can be improved

00:13:00.757 --> 00:13:08.056
and they can be made absolutely top class,
its possible.

00:13:08.056 --> 00:13:14.187
It depends now here it comes into other powers
that are within.

00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:19.866
One power which is the desire.

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:28.306
Though the Kundalini as you see is the power
of pure desire that it doesn't want anything.

00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:32.407
But it wants to give you self-realization.

00:13:32.407 --> 00:13:41.847
The other two powers - one of them is the
mundane desire.

00:13:41.847 --> 00:13:54.377
This mundane desire if it becomes nothing
but pure desire, then Kundalini has no problems

00:13:54.377 --> 00:13:57.606
from the left side.

00:13:57.606 --> 00:14:10.866
But if it is not a pure desire, but full of
other desires - for example: the first desire

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:17.557
of human beings, which comes from animals
I think, is food.

00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:24.597
He wants food to nourish himself.

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:32.717
But human being don't only take food to nourish,
also for the taste of it, or for the beauty

00:14:32.717 --> 00:14:38.497
of it, which is innately working in them.

00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:58.227
That's why we run after food, which is very
good, very tasty, all kinds of ideas we have

00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:01.477
and there's no standard.

00:15:01.477 --> 00:15:11.757
Somebody can like this, somebody can like
that, but the one who understands that the

00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:26.707
taste of the food is not important and can
practice it, then it works.

00:15:26.707 --> 00:15:47.276
It works wonders because the lowest desire,
which is of food, comes under your control.

00:15:47.276 --> 00:15:56.727
If you can sometimes go without food, of course
not for God but for yourself, God doesn't

00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:58.857
want you to starve.

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:14.977
If you can live without food, if you can enjoy
every type of food, then you have done a lot

00:16:14.977 --> 00:16:23.567
to improve the path of Shushumna for the Kundalini.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:38.166
I've seen in many cases that Kundalini just
doesn't rise, She doesn't rise, even if She

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:41.456
rises, She falls back.

00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:53.597
This happens when a person is very self-indulgent
- is all the time thinking of things, which

00:16:53.597 --> 00:17:03.137
are not of very great importance for Spirituality.

00:17:03.137 --> 00:17:18.487
Apart from this there's another horrible one
desire we have is to grab as much money as

00:17:18.487 --> 00:17:23.257
possible, to think about money.

00:17:23.257 --> 00:17:29.857
This time I had a bad experience because Sahaja
Yogis came down to Me and told Me, "Mother

00:17:29.857 --> 00:17:35.577
they are asking if I, if we should reduce
the puja money or something?"

00:17:35.577 --> 00:17:39.177
I was shocked because I never decide about
it.

00:17:39.177 --> 00:17:42.577
It's all decided by the leaders.

00:17:42.577 --> 00:17:47.117
I said, "I am not concerned."

00:17:47.117 --> 00:17:53.797
Then they would like to have a bargain as
you have in the shop you see or maybe some

00:17:53.797 --> 00:17:56.357
sort of a sale or some sort of a thing.

00:17:56.357 --> 00:18:02.647
This is one of the greatest dangers in your
ascent.

00:18:02.647 --> 00:18:06.786
For a guru people pay millions and millions.

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:12.637
Where you know I am working it out for your
projects, I am buying lands for you, I am

00:18:12.637 --> 00:18:17.327
doing things for you and for which you need
money.

00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:24.457
But nobody comes forward with any donations
as such.

00:18:24.457 --> 00:18:32.107
They won't, they don't understand that it
is for you I have to have all these things

00:18:32.107 --> 00:18:40.967
not for Me and they pestered people many a
times like this.

00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:46.396
Once suddenly they decided that we could have
fifty percent payment.

00:18:46.396 --> 00:18:52.547
Immediately so many telephone - "Ah are you
going to have fifty percent less the bargain

00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:53.547
price?

00:18:53.547 --> 00:18:56.247
We are coming for the bargain".

00:18:56.247 --> 00:18:59.666
Is the sale programming.

00:18:59.666 --> 00:19:05.407
For example in the sale what do they do?

00:19:05.407 --> 00:19:17.757
They offer you something, so that they can
get a lot more customers or things like that.

00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:22.630
Sahaja yoga is just the opposite of that.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.367
You don't have to give anything but you get
lot.

00:19:26.367 --> 00:19:33.047
But this is not for sale; this is not for
sale by any chance.

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:41.047
It is a thing where you have to pay because
we have to have all these things and I have

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:47.166
to pay so many things which you do not know
- like last time we had about I think fifty

00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:52.687
people who came just free.

00:19:52.687 --> 00:19:54.427
Some of the leaders know.

00:19:54.427 --> 00:20:01.937
But some of the leaders, they just go on asking
like this because I don't know perhaps they

00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:07.587
want to save money or they want to popularize
themselves among the disciples maybe, that

00:20:07.587 --> 00:20:13.557
is the reason.

00:20:13.557 --> 00:20:24.637
So this thinking about money itself is a very
detrimental force for your spirituality.

00:20:24.637 --> 00:20:27.797
Otherwise what others are doing is the same.

00:20:27.797 --> 00:20:31.747
All the time they are thinking of money, thinking
of money.

00:20:31.747 --> 00:20:40.507
Now if you are thinking of money and thinking
of earning more, for Sahaja Yoga to help Sahaja

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:43.257
Yoga it's all right.

00:20:43.257 --> 00:20:45.596
But it is for yours own ideas.

00:20:45.596 --> 00:20:49.096
In the West it's very common.

00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:57.187
Not in India I must tell you, we; India is
the poor country but one day Yogi told Me,

00:20:57.187 --> 00:21:01.487
"Mother I need some money for the school".

00:21:01.487 --> 00:21:03.447
I said, "All right I'll give you".

00:21:03.447 --> 00:21:05.166
"No, no", he said, "I'll collect".

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:08.447
And he collected in one meeting eighteen lakhs
of Rupees.

00:21:08.447 --> 00:21:16.786
Of course I told him, "Now don't take it,
I've got money to pay, don't collect".

00:21:16.786 --> 00:21:21.587
But so much of money orientation all the time.

00:21:21.587 --> 00:21:32.597
Thinking about money, saving money, these
things are absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:35.367
You can ask anyone how much I understand about
money.

00:21:35.367 --> 00:21:42.287
I don't understand banking, I cannot count,
even thousand pounds I cannot count.

00:21:42.287 --> 00:21:46.697
I'll count them two thousand or three thousand;
I don't know what I do?

00:21:46.697 --> 00:21:50.997
My brain goes off when it comes to money.

00:21:50.997 --> 00:21:52.027
I don't know how to count.

00:21:52.027 --> 00:21:58.137
I am not worried about what money we have,
what we have, what we have to do is this money

00:21:58.137 --> 00:22:06.036
is here let us do something about it.

00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:11.247
Today I don't know why I have to tell about
this gross subject.

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:16.476
But it has been pointed out to Me, "Mother
you never say anything about it and the people

00:22:16.476 --> 00:22:20.077
are getting really materialistic".

00:22:20.077 --> 00:22:22.797
That's a very sad affair.

00:22:22.797 --> 00:22:29.437
Even one person, who is materialistic, will
have to go out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:29.437 --> 00:22:41.457
Gradually it will work that way and you'll
be surprised that you are out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:41.457 --> 00:22:52.456
It is very amazing how after getting realization
also, getting on top of the world, we still

00:22:52.456 --> 00:23:02.896
live in small little holes like rats of this
money business.

00:23:02.896 --> 00:23:14.297
This money has brought so much problems to
our world, you can see it clearly.

00:23:14.297 --> 00:23:21.157
All this Economics and all this knowledge
of Economics where it has gone?

00:23:21.157 --> 00:23:24.016
Is the world better by it?

00:23:24.016 --> 00:23:30.706
There's recession going on everywhere, everybody
is unemployed.

00:23:30.706 --> 00:23:36.476
In every country you go there's unemployment
so much; this is so much.

00:23:36.476 --> 00:23:45.487
That shows that this Economics is also a very
artificial science and dealing with the weakness

00:23:45.487 --> 00:23:52.797
of human being, not with their strength.

00:23:52.797 --> 00:23:59.927
If they could know the strength of human beings,
they would have done much better than they

00:23:59.927 --> 00:24:04.557
have done so far.

00:24:04.557 --> 00:24:17.916
I'll give a simple example: Now, we have very
sophisticated places in the West, very sophisticated.

00:24:17.916 --> 00:24:26.487
You know they have everything electrical,
you push the button and everything is there.

00:24:26.487 --> 00:24:31.007
Specially in these modern planes when I travel,
I don't know which one to push because they

00:24:31.007 --> 00:24:40.666
are so slim and so delicate you see, need
a special artist to do that.

00:24:40.666 --> 00:24:45.966
All this is for what for getting more money,
and more money and impressing people.

00:24:45.966 --> 00:24:54.966
But at the same time people are fed up; when
all these sophistications are on.

00:24:54.966 --> 00:24:59.677
They are fed up with computers, they are fed
up with electricity, they are fed up with

00:24:59.677 --> 00:25:05.427
cement, they are fed up all kinds of artificial
thing, is a fact.

00:25:05.427 --> 00:25:10.916
More, more, much more in the West than in
the developing countries.

00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:13.107
They are just fed up.

00:25:13.107 --> 00:25:20.076
Now this is the force, this is the strength.

00:25:20.076 --> 00:25:21.867
Why are they fed up?

00:25:21.867 --> 00:25:31.857
They are fed up because they have realized
it doesn't give you joy.

00:25:31.857 --> 00:25:35.387
It doesn't give you soothing feeling.

00:25:35.387 --> 00:25:39.087
It irritates them.

00:25:39.087 --> 00:25:53.567
So it is against human mind, human character
or human civilization, something inhuman.

00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.277
So now what to do?

00:25:55.277 --> 00:26:05.867
I went to America once, and went to see a
friend of ours and all the houses were covered

00:26:05.867 --> 00:26:08.737
with the cow dung color you see.

00:26:08.737 --> 00:26:15.417
I said, "Why do they have these cow dung all
over these houses you know?

00:26:15.417 --> 00:26:16.437
What is the matter with them?

00:26:16.437 --> 00:26:22.127
Why don't they have nice white or another
people like very much is this sand color?

00:26:22.127 --> 00:26:27.677
He said, "Now a days these Americans want
to have cow dung."

00:26:27.677 --> 00:26:29.987
I said, "Cow dung!

00:26:29.987 --> 00:26:31.147
For what?"

00:26:31.147 --> 00:26:33.957
"Because they are fed up of cement.

00:26:33.957 --> 00:26:37.757
Now they can't get so much cow dung here.

00:26:37.757 --> 00:26:46.677
So they have a special way of making cement
look like cow dung.

00:26:46.677 --> 00:26:54.237
They mix up things so the color comes out
like cow dung".

00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:57.777
I said, "Why the cow dung of all the things
you see?"

00:26:57.777 --> 00:27:05.047
So they said that some of them went to India
and they had to sleep in some huts, which

00:27:05.047 --> 00:27:08.317
were covered with cow dung.

00:27:08.317 --> 00:27:17.587
So they found out logically that cow dung
if we have, it will be the most soothing color

00:27:17.587 --> 00:27:19.697
for us.

00:27:19.697 --> 00:27:26.717
And so there were articles about it and people
have started using cow dung.

00:27:26.717 --> 00:27:30.137
So what is the force now behind?

00:27:30.137 --> 00:27:32.027
What is the strength?

00:27:32.027 --> 00:27:41.877
The strength is that they want to live in
natural way; they don't want to have artificial

00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:44.647
things.

00:27:44.647 --> 00:27:47.987
So they go to another extreme to have cow
dung.

00:27:47.987 --> 00:27:54.147
Sahaja Yoga is in between.

00:27:54.147 --> 00:28:02.627
Now one has to understand that whether you
put cow dung or you put cement or anything,

00:28:02.627 --> 00:28:05.447
it's not going to give you joy.

00:28:05.447 --> 00:28:18.737
Say for India people who have got cement houses
are great, you know?

00:28:18.737 --> 00:28:25.867
According to them cement represents luxury
and also rank.

00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:35.057
But in the West if people see cement, my goodness,
cement means to them it is something like

00:28:35.057 --> 00:28:38.237
a grave.

00:28:38.237 --> 00:28:46.167
So now the positive thing that is in with
them is that they now want to live with a

00:28:46.167 --> 00:28:50.427
natural things.

00:28:50.427 --> 00:28:54.407
They want to use natural material.

00:28:54.407 --> 00:28:57.697
Natural life.

00:28:57.697 --> 00:29:06.207
But to the extreme if they go you see we had
anti culture like hippyism and all that.

00:29:06.207 --> 00:29:07.727
It brought no luck.

00:29:07.727 --> 00:29:23.267
So to get from one end to another extreme
it also not conducive to a human life because;

00:29:23.267 --> 00:29:27.847
and you see a human being cannot become primitive.

00:29:27.847 --> 00:29:35.037
Even if he tries to dress up like a primitive
person his brain is modern.

00:29:35.037 --> 00:29:44.767
So when they get fed up from one to another,
they don't realize that what is the missing

00:29:44.767 --> 00:29:48.287
point?

00:29:48.287 --> 00:29:58.897
In both the things whether you live like a
rustic person or a very cementy person, any

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:11.547
type you might live, the missing point is
that in everything there is a competition.

00:30:11.547 --> 00:30:16.217
Once it starts the fashion all right everybody
will have cane chairs; everybody is having

00:30:16.217 --> 00:30:22.247
cane chairs.

00:30:22.247 --> 00:30:30.667
Now in this competition, they miss the point
is the joy.

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:40.537
A person who is a realized soul will not desire
whether it is cement or anything or anything

00:30:40.537 --> 00:30:43.627
doesn't matter its just the same.

00:30:43.627 --> 00:30:57.397
But it will come to his mind that all these
artificial things are ruining human beings.

00:30:57.397 --> 00:30:58.947
So he'll say no.

00:30:58.947 --> 00:31:11.677
But he will not have hair like the primitive
people; he'll not behave like primitive people

00:31:11.677 --> 00:31:18.547
and lead a very normal, natural life.

00:31:18.547 --> 00:31:24.527
So when the mind starts thinking something
about it, it will never get to the point of

00:31:24.527 --> 00:31:30.867
joy, from one end to another.

00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:38.957
So they think that they are going into a balance,
they are going into dharma.

00:31:38.957 --> 00:31:43.437
My experience is different.

00:31:43.437 --> 00:31:49.957
Even those who were hippies I know them, they
used to eat like real gluttons and they are

00:31:49.957 --> 00:31:56.847
very much interested in their comforts and
they would go to any extent of snatching anything

00:31:56.847 --> 00:31:58.957
of that belongs to somebody else.

00:31:58.957 --> 00:32:06.467
They thought they now become hippies so they're
already the landlords, because they have given

00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:10.287
up this, they have given up that.

00:32:10.287 --> 00:32:20.927
So the mind that suggest that to overcome
your money orientation, your competition and

00:32:20.927 --> 00:32:27.737
all these artificial things you should change
your life style.

00:32:27.737 --> 00:32:34.097
But that doesn't help, never.

00:32:34.097 --> 00:32:41.257
It's just a play of the mind from one to another.

00:32:41.257 --> 00:32:50.397
So how to detach yourself from this idea of
money orientation?

00:32:50.397 --> 00:33:02.427
Whether you wear a sanyasi's dress or you
wear a wonderful - some very expensive dress,

00:33:02.427 --> 00:33:06.487
is the same to the body.

00:33:06.487 --> 00:33:09.697
You can't even see your own dress.

00:33:09.697 --> 00:33:13.407
So is the same to the eyes.

00:33:13.407 --> 00:33:25.677
But with the mind you start convincing yourself
that now I've become a big sanyasi because

00:33:25.677 --> 00:33:30.127
I am wearing a saffron dress.

00:33:30.127 --> 00:33:38.087
By wearing that kind of a dress you can never
get rid of this nonsense.

00:33:38.087 --> 00:33:41.097
So first thing you have to be a normal person.

00:33:41.097 --> 00:33:46.007
There is no need to be abnormal outside.

00:33:46.007 --> 00:33:59.347
That you are deceiving yourself.

00:33:59.347 --> 00:34:07.547
If you think by changing your dress, attire,
your lifestyle you have become a great sanyasi

00:34:07.547 --> 00:34:15.357
or a great, detached person from this money
orientation then I must say, 'don't deceive

00:34:15.357 --> 00:34:18.417
yourself'.

00:34:18.417 --> 00:34:35.547
A person who is detached from within helps
the Kundalini to rise constantly without any

00:34:35.547 --> 00:34:40.837
catches.

00:34:40.837 --> 00:34:52.927
So for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to introspect
and see for himself what is your level?

00:34:52.927 --> 00:35:01.757
As I told you about the reflector what sort
of a reflector you are?

00:35:01.757 --> 00:35:08.437
No use deceiving yourself because Sahaja Yoga
is for you, for your benevolence and your

00:35:08.437 --> 00:35:13.827
Kundalini is for your benevolence.

00:35:13.827 --> 00:35:24.867
The ascent is the aim of your life and to
perfect it is your job.

00:35:24.867 --> 00:35:34.037
So you don't have to take to anything outside.

00:35:34.037 --> 00:35:44.847
It is inside you have to see yourself what
sort of attachments you have.

00:35:44.847 --> 00:35:54.047
The second force which is, I am surprised
how has suddenly come up among Sahaja Yogis

00:35:54.047 --> 00:35:56.777
that they don't have immorality problems.

00:35:56.777 --> 00:36:01.127
They have just become moral, most of them.

00:36:01.127 --> 00:36:06.677
Ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, I think
are moral people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:06.677 --> 00:36:14.467
There may be here and there because they enjoy
their morality.

00:36:14.467 --> 00:36:20.847
Because they enjoy their morality they want
to be that.

00:36:20.847 --> 00:36:26.367
Not only that they want their children to
be moral, their families to be moral.

00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:32.707
And that is how morality is spreading in Sahaja
Yoga very fast.

00:36:32.707 --> 00:36:41.347
In that also one has to understand that it
is the innocence, which is the force.

00:36:41.347 --> 00:36:47.177
Not the morality like some people write to
Me, "Mother I get up in the morning, I sit

00:36:47.177 --> 00:36:54.457
before the photograph, I do this, I do that,
then I take my bath and then I do this."

00:36:54.457 --> 00:37:00.887
I don't, I cant understand this, no not necessary.

00:37:00.887 --> 00:37:07.877
You have to cleanse yourself once in the night
as you cleanse yourself - your body.

00:37:07.877 --> 00:37:13.287
And once in the morning you have to pray,
that's all.

00:37:13.287 --> 00:37:18.797
Is not necessary to have this ritualism, this
kind of a rigmarole.

00:37:18.797 --> 00:37:21.907
Oh all the time you go in.

00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:29.237
Everyday morning till evening nonsensical
these things and they become fanatic.

00:37:29.237 --> 00:37:35.977
They start becoming absolutely fanatic about
Sahaja yoga and this fanaticism can be very

00:37:35.977 --> 00:37:44.667
dangerous because they try to remember everything
by heart this and that.

00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:47.977
No, not necessary.

00:37:47.977 --> 00:37:54.877
It should be in the heart because it amounts
to the lip service there and with the lip

00:37:54.877 --> 00:38:01.357
service gradually you start feeling you are
great, your father is great, you this and

00:38:01.357 --> 00:38:02.357
that.

00:38:02.357 --> 00:38:04.237
So you are thrown away.

00:38:04.237 --> 00:38:10.387
You yourself throw yourself out like a, I
can say like a - you hit a ball and it comes

00:38:10.387 --> 00:38:16.127
back like, I've seen people - many who try
to thrust themselves in Sahaja Yoga just are

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:20.817
repelled back by themselves, not by Sahaja
Yoga.

00:38:20.817 --> 00:38:25.947
Sahaja Yoga attracts you, no doubt.

00:38:25.947 --> 00:38:28.567
But you must have gravity.

00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:34.647
If you don't have gravity how can you be attracted?

00:38:34.647 --> 00:38:43.367
The seriousness about it is only this - that
you should introspect, seriously.

00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:46.357
Find out what's wrong with you.

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:51.107
Because this is a great chance for you to
ascend.

00:38:51.107 --> 00:39:01.207
With this kind of a mind, which becomes fanatic
in Sahaja Yoga, starts saying harsh things

00:39:01.207 --> 00:39:15.377
to other and disturbing the peace of others
because they think they are very great Sahaja

00:39:15.377 --> 00:39:16.697
Yogis.

00:39:16.697 --> 00:39:24.427
Then I think one should introspect and find
out why am I doing it?

00:39:24.427 --> 00:39:29.777
So many people have the same defects but for
that they'll scold others.

00:39:29.777 --> 00:39:33.417
Perhaps maybe they think by correcting another
person they might be corrected.

00:39:33.417 --> 00:39:37.357
I don't know what is the idea of their procedure
is?

00:39:37.357 --> 00:39:47.797
But it is very absurd sometimes; the way people
look at their, look at their problems as if

00:39:47.797 --> 00:39:49.507
these are the problems of others.

00:39:49.507 --> 00:39:56.407
Now, if I am saying this to you somebody must
be counting - "Ah I know this one Mother is

00:39:56.407 --> 00:39:58.367
saying about that one".

00:39:58.367 --> 00:40:05.947
Never will say that it's for me and I have
to see myself and introspect and find out

00:40:05.947 --> 00:40:12.267
what is dragging me down.

00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:19.227
So this is one of the most important things
is that you cannot be harsh, you cannot hurt

00:40:19.227 --> 00:40:26.327
people, you cannot misbehave in that manner,
and if you can't do that then you are thrown

00:40:26.327 --> 00:40:31.907
out of Sahaja Yoga by yourself, nobody has
to throw you.

00:40:31.907 --> 00:40:37.657
You have to correct you, people have to like
you and you have to be one of them.

00:40:37.657 --> 00:40:44.007
If the collectivity is not there, your Kundalini
will never rise.

00:40:44.007 --> 00:40:50.377
Because She's rising, She's trying to give
you a second birth so that you become one

00:40:50.377 --> 00:40:52.027
with the whole.

00:40:52.027 --> 00:40:53.557
The drop becomes the ocean.

00:40:53.557 --> 00:40:56.047
That's Her job, She'll never rise.

00:40:56.047 --> 00:41:05.377
A person who thinks he's very exclusive, special
should not come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:05.377 --> 00:41:15.517
This is another great hurdle in raising the
Kundalini when people think that they are

00:41:15.517 --> 00:41:18.297
something special.

00:41:18.297 --> 00:41:23.907
We have no priesthood.

00:41:23.907 --> 00:41:33.917
And leadership is also is a myth I think,
people whom I think are better off with their

00:41:33.917 --> 00:41:38.127
Kundalini I can communicate better.

00:41:38.127 --> 00:41:42.707
But sometimes they too behave in such a manner
that one is shocked.

00:41:42.707 --> 00:41:45.707
How could they behave like this?

00:41:45.707 --> 00:41:51.117
And these serpents you see just suddenly come
up and you see them.

00:41:51.117 --> 00:41:57.097
You are shocked what are they doing, where
is their attention?

00:41:57.097 --> 00:42:03.977
What are they worried about?

00:42:03.977 --> 00:42:09.717
So such stupid ideas if they walk into your
mind tell them, shut up now I know myself

00:42:09.717 --> 00:42:11.367
very well.

00:42:11.367 --> 00:42:17.107
That's the best way to keep you out of it
all these nonsensical things that are working.

00:42:17.107 --> 00:42:22.547
First of all you must remember that you are
seekers of truth.

00:42:22.547 --> 00:42:31.317
Have been seeking truth for ages, for years
together and now, I would say for many lives

00:42:31.317 --> 00:42:33.566
and now you have found it.

00:42:33.566 --> 00:42:45.107
So grab it and hold it fast by understanding
that this is what you wanted you've got it

00:42:45.107 --> 00:42:47.026
now.

00:42:47.026 --> 00:42:54.168
The another big problem that comes in the
awakening of the Kundalini which I feel is

00:42:54.168 --> 00:43:01.887
very important to be told to you is that some
of you think that you are very close to Me.

00:43:01.887 --> 00:43:10.796
That you have a special right on Me.

00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:15.456
You don't know your Mother is a Mahamaya,
be careful.

00:43:15.456 --> 00:43:19.176
I am telling you again and again.

00:43:19.176 --> 00:43:22.837
Never think that way.

00:43:22.837 --> 00:43:27.357
Nobody can be My favorite, I assure you, cannot
be.

00:43:27.357 --> 00:43:41.047
It is like a mercury if you put it on another
metal or something doesn't stick you know.

00:43:41.047 --> 00:43:45.506
My mind never sticks to anyone, never sticks.

00:43:45.506 --> 00:43:50.946
Now supposing somebody is in trouble, somebody
has written to Me, there's some problem, then

00:43:50.946 --> 00:43:53.396
the thought comes in.

00:43:53.396 --> 00:44:05.147
But I don't stick to that, I don't stick to
anyone nor do I have any attachment to anyone

00:44:05.147 --> 00:44:09.867
because that will be against the principle
of pure love.

00:44:09.867 --> 00:44:15.627
I cannot be attached, of course I see your
problems very intimately.

00:44:15.627 --> 00:44:25.767
I would love to solve them, I get worried
sometimes, you can call it worried, but the

00:44:25.767 --> 00:44:33.307
thought - attention is going towards that
person.

00:44:33.307 --> 00:44:45.756
You've seen when there's a tide, the Moon
when it is full Moon the tide is much bigger.

00:44:45.756 --> 00:44:56.597
Does the ocean think what about the Moon?

00:44:56.597 --> 00:45:05.617
Does he think that it has to attract the particular
ocean or someone?

00:45:05.617 --> 00:45:12.226
It's just the nature - the swabhava, the nature
itself that acts.

00:45:12.226 --> 00:45:24.406
That's the nature, you can't help it and this
nature is the one you should also try to adopt

00:45:24.406 --> 00:45:29.547
and adore because it's very helpful.

00:45:29.547 --> 00:45:37.087
This gives you a great relief from your mind,
which is always thinking, thinking, thinking

00:45:37.087 --> 00:45:42.646
and doesn't allow you to have thoughtless
awareness.

00:45:42.646 --> 00:45:50.476
Get attached to someone, you are worried about
some problems, even your problems sometimes,

00:45:50.476 --> 00:45:51.476
all the time your problem.

00:45:51.476 --> 00:45:58.756
Thinking about your problem or about somebody
whom you are attached to.

00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:00.487
Then this mind starts working.

00:46:00.487 --> 00:46:05.337
How to solve the problem, what to do, this
and that?

00:46:05.337 --> 00:46:12.176
But then you stop your Agnya completely, how
will the Kundalini rise?

00:46:12.176 --> 00:46:20.736
In any walk of life for a Sahaja Yogi, it
is the best way to stop thinking is to think

00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:24.207
how he's going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:24.207 --> 00:46:28.236
Just divert your attention.

00:46:28.236 --> 00:46:35.577
This is the greatest pleasure for you, for
which you don't have to pay or anything; just

00:46:35.577 --> 00:46:38.427
know what powers you have got.

00:46:38.427 --> 00:46:47.186
At this point I find many people are not at
all aware of their powers and not using them.

00:46:47.186 --> 00:46:52.206
When you don't use your powers also Kundalini
falls down.

00:46:52.206 --> 00:46:55.067
Why should She work?

00:46:55.067 --> 00:47:06.656
She's not stupid; if you don't want to use
Her for what She has to achieve then why should

00:47:06.656 --> 00:47:08.837
She worry about you?

00:47:08.837 --> 00:47:12.917
So She just drops down, She has nothing to
do with you.

00:47:12.917 --> 00:47:16.967
Then suddenly you come out, "Mother I got
this trouble, I've got that trouble, this

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.387
happened".

00:47:18.387 --> 00:47:28.597
Especially troubles like arthritis and all
such troubles come from people who don't use

00:47:28.597 --> 00:47:30.506
their vibrations.

00:47:30.506 --> 00:47:39.047
Give it to the flowers, give it to the trees,
give it to anything that is living but don't

00:47:39.047 --> 00:47:41.617
shirk it.

00:47:41.617 --> 00:47:48.567
You need not touch the person but the desire
should be 'whom should I give vibrations?'

00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:55.966
Only worry should be 'whom should I put attention
to?

00:47:55.966 --> 00:48:00.156
Where should I put this energy of mine?'

00:48:00.156 --> 00:48:05.887
Once you start using, this Divine Power it
starts flowing much more, much more and your

00:48:05.887 --> 00:48:12.297
Mother - the Kundalini is very happy.

00:48:12.297 --> 00:48:16.787
And then you start seeing wonders what's happening.

00:48:16.787 --> 00:48:28.006
For that you have to have first of all attention
on compassion and love; but compassion and

00:48:28.006 --> 00:48:33.236
love of God - God Almighty.

00:48:33.236 --> 00:48:40.256
But when I talk of compassion I find people
are more interested in the people who are,

00:48:40.256 --> 00:48:47.047
Sahaja Yogis who are suffering, who have problems,
who are thrown away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:47.047 --> 00:48:51.906
They will write to Me, "Mother please, please
some or other take them back".

00:48:51.906 --> 00:48:53.567
That's My job not yours.

00:48:53.567 --> 00:49:04.996
But those who don't love God, they are not
going to achieve much.

00:49:04.996 --> 00:49:13.827
They have loose tongues, they talk funnily,
they don't understand they are dealing with

00:49:13.827 --> 00:49:24.337
God Almighty and this kind of frivolous talking
and frivolous behavior; you must understand

00:49:24.337 --> 00:49:30.857
that angels are around you all the time, all
the time they are with you.

00:49:30.857 --> 00:49:31.887
They watch you.

00:49:31.887 --> 00:49:43.256
They will help you, they'll support you, they'll
elevate you, they'll cross all kinds of hurdles

00:49:43.256 --> 00:49:56.797
but you have to love God from all your heart
and all your soul.

00:49:56.797 --> 00:50:12.567
You can't say things, which are not full of
protocol.

00:50:12.567 --> 00:50:19.287
All this is only possible when you surrender
your ego.

00:50:19.287 --> 00:50:25.246
God doesn't want anything from you.

00:50:25.246 --> 00:50:26.587
What can you give to God?

00:50:26.587 --> 00:50:29.317
It's a funny idea people have.

00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:33.996
But its all right you can give anything to
God.

00:50:33.996 --> 00:50:41.767
Krishna has said that you can give Me flowers,
you can give Me water, you can give Me this

00:50:41.767 --> 00:50:48.646
presents, this / that, I'll accept.

00:50:48.646 --> 00:50:52.427
But what does He say?

00:50:52.427 --> 00:51:05.637
That only thing that you have to do is to
be one with Me.

00:51:05.637 --> 00:51:12.117
You have to be one with Me, you have to connect,
be connected with Me.

00:51:12.117 --> 00:51:21.577
And this feeling of connection is so satisfying,
is so joy giving, so nice, which cannot be

00:51:21.577 --> 00:51:25.117
described in words.

00:51:25.117 --> 00:51:39.317
Thus you find your Kundalini is just flowing
out with joy for yourself and for others.

00:51:39.317 --> 00:51:53.067
Also the right side - ambitiousness, domination,
showing off, harshness, cruelties.

00:51:53.067 --> 00:51:56.726
I don't know how many things there are on
the right side.

00:51:56.726 --> 00:51:58.907
But they can be unlimited.

00:51:58.907 --> 00:52:02.387
I mean the limit is Hitler you can say, so
far.

00:52:02.387 --> 00:52:09.636
God knows some other may come to compete with
him, but so far he's the last word.

00:52:09.636 --> 00:52:20.267
So all these also start destroying this Kundalini.

00:52:20.267 --> 00:52:34.196
I've seen also Kundalini of people which is
hurt, wounded, just can't rise, finished.

00:52:34.196 --> 00:52:41.976
Then I feel that let them take a second birth;
only then one can work it out because is impossible

00:52:41.976 --> 00:52:47.437
for such a Kundalini to make Her rise.

00:52:47.437 --> 00:52:59.216
If you are selfish and you are cruel then
this Kundalini becomes hurt.

00:52:59.216 --> 00:53:04.287
A good mother feels hurt when her child misbehaves.

00:53:04.287 --> 00:53:12.436
So this Kundalini gets very hurt because She
wants you to have your second birth and She

00:53:12.436 --> 00:53:18.707
cant just bear it and this makes Her absolutely
incapable of rising.

00:53:18.707 --> 00:53:26.186
She becomes sick, ill and wounded.

00:53:26.186 --> 00:53:31.156
So all kinds of aggressiveness should be given
up.

00:53:31.156 --> 00:53:38.156
That's not going to help because you have
come to Sahaja Yoga not for saving money or

00:53:38.156 --> 00:53:39.617
bargaining or anything.

00:53:39.617 --> 00:53:44.537
You have come here because you are seekers.

00:53:44.537 --> 00:53:51.466
I've seen invariably people who have been
to false gurus always have this kind of a

00:53:51.466 --> 00:53:55.506
money orientation because they must have been
lynched completely by the previous gurus,

00:53:55.506 --> 00:53:59.527
maybe, I don't know what to say.

00:53:59.527 --> 00:54:10.236
So it is we who can rise through our own goodness
and beauty.

00:54:10.236 --> 00:54:20.847
And it is we who can come up to a level of
great Sahaja Yogis.

00:54:20.847 --> 00:54:22.767
Don't keep this power with yourself.

00:54:22.767 --> 00:54:31.996
It is to be distributed and given to others
and make others also very happy and joyous.

00:54:31.996 --> 00:54:36.357
Is a duty of every Sahaja Yogi to do it.

00:54:36.357 --> 00:54:45.256
Also thinking about Sahaja Yoga, not about
yourself is the best way to avoid many problems.

00:54:45.256 --> 00:54:49.827
But once they start thinking about Sahaja
Yoga, they start thinking about the defects

00:54:49.827 --> 00:54:56.476
of Sahaja Yogis; that's not going to help.

00:54:56.476 --> 00:55:02.537
You have to develop that peace of mind within
yourself by which you can become the witness

00:55:02.537 --> 00:55:06.337
of yourself first.

00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:10.587
You should be able to witness yourself and
see what are the things, which are putting

00:55:10.587 --> 00:55:11.947
you down.

00:55:11.947 --> 00:55:18.216
Because today the world is absolutely chaotic,
from this chaotic world you have to rise into

00:55:18.216 --> 00:55:25.466
a very peaceful, beautiful world and you have
to take many to that.

00:55:25.466 --> 00:55:27.966
For that you have to have the quality.

00:55:27.966 --> 00:55:36.236
It's not just you become Sahaja Yogis, put
My badge here and all that.

00:55:36.236 --> 00:55:40.486
In every way you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:40.486 --> 00:55:46.216
But be careful because one should not feel
that you've done a great job.

00:55:46.216 --> 00:55:55.957
Whatever you are doing is for your own good
not for others.

00:55:55.957 --> 00:56:07.317
Now we have to see what a great thing that
has happened because Kundalini was a big mystery

00:56:07.317 --> 00:56:08.317
before.

00:56:08.317 --> 00:56:13.527
But now it is not anymore, it's all open.

00:56:13.527 --> 00:56:18.017
You all know about it.

00:56:18.017 --> 00:56:24.517
You know about its powers, you know how you
can achieve your highest goal.

00:56:24.517 --> 00:56:34.637
So just to balance, just to lead a mediocre
life is not the way a real true seeker of

00:56:34.637 --> 00:56:35.716
truth should do.

00:56:35.716 --> 00:56:41.367
But if you are the real seeker of truth, then
you should see what's wrong with what I've

00:56:41.367 --> 00:56:46.767
been doing, whatever I've been following and
what I have to achieve.

00:56:46.767 --> 00:56:52.406
All the scriptures have said that you have
to be the Spirit.

00:56:52.406 --> 00:56:57.267
All the scriptures had said that you have
to be born again, I am not saying that anymore.

00:56:57.267 --> 00:57:06.126
Only thing what I am doing it what they have
said I am trying to do it and requesting that

00:57:06.126 --> 00:57:07.126
you should do.

00:57:07.126 --> 00:57:14.166
Sahaja Yoga is not going to be like other
religions where people abuse children, do

00:57:14.166 --> 00:57:19.226
what they like, make money, this/ that, all
nonsense - like a mafia.

00:57:19.226 --> 00:57:29.006
You are people who are chosen and are special
people who believe in a good moral life and

00:57:29.006 --> 00:57:30.617
a peaceful life.

00:57:30.617 --> 00:57:34.736
May God bless you.
