00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:08.417
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:11.875
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:15.541
when you are all leaving this country,

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:22.833
and this kind of a special type of a puja

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.833
that we are having today.

00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:30.459
This is the puja done to the sun,

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:35.083
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:42.875
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:44.833
Capricorn is Makar.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.042
towards the tropic of Cancer,

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:57.625
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.708
it has something to do with the sun.

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:02.833
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.000
because they have to deal with the sun.

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:07.875
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:09.875
that they have put it on the fifteenth

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:12.625
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:17.917
Now today is, they are changing,

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:23.417
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:29.958
We've got six months when this moves,

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.334
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:37.958
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:41.833
from tomorrow.

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:46.917
So today is the last day, which we say that

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.583
is the day which is the coldest day,

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:53.625
according to Indian understanding.

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.917
After this the heat will start growing

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.833
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:06.708
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.042
during the summer-time.

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:11.541
Though it's very hot in summer,

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:15.375
still people wants the sun to rule us

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.292
and to give us warmth because,

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:23.417
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:26.209
all the fruits, everything grows.

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:31.292
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.167
we call it as "Sankrant,"

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.459
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.334
That is when of course in the,

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:44.209
in the European countries or say in England or America,

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.541
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:54.875
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:58.459
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:01.000
means the end of the calamity is over.

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.083
And they give something sweet to eat

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.209
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.499
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.375
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:21.125
also want you to retain the heat

00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:24.541
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:27.541
This is all thought of in a way,

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.875
in a very gross level,

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.334
on a very gross level,

00:03:30.334 --> 00:03:33.875
that we should keep the people warm enough.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.083
Also it is said that

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:42.417
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:45.625
for people, because it is the coldest day.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:49.459
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.541
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.417
- means "you say something sweet to us."

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.125
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:02.209
than the people who live in colder places,

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:06.083
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:08.334
I don't blame them for their temperament,

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:11.083
because the nature is so unkind.

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.417
In India you can live anywhere:

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:15.250
you can live under a tree,

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:18.417
you can live in a forest,

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:20.666
anywhere you can live quite happily,

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:24.666
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:28.791
And there's not such a problem as

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:31.708
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.833
where if you have to go out of the house

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:37.499
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.417
Here you just can walk out of the house,

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:42.417
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:45.250
and there's no problem of any kind

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.417
as far as the nature is concerned.

00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:52.125
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:56.958
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.250
people feel very happy during that time,

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:09.292
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:15.083
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:16.666
Because of that,

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:18.583
people keep more to their houses,

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:21.167
to artificial heating or other heatings,

00:05:21.417 --> 00:05:23.500
and the doors are closed,

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.417
the hearts are closed,

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:29.499
and it's difficult for them to

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.500
communicate with other people.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:38.833
As you go down south more in your countries also,

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.083
you'll find people are warmer,

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.292
simpler,

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:49.167
very hospitable.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:54.541
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:58.541
and a kind of a inviting heart.

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:02.250
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:04.833
the sun line is the right side

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:08.334
and the moon, moon is the left side.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.499
On the moon line

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.042
one can desire but cannot act.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.292
Apart from that, on the moon line

00:06:17.292 --> 00:06:20.250
if you go too far it can be destructive.

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:23.375
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:28.417
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:33.250
no work - then you start thinking too much,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.917
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:40.375
no action.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:42.375
And without the action

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.958
this energy can become very destructive.

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:47.917
That is why we find that people,

00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:49.917
they say that "empty mind,

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:55.917
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.125
Where people have, do not act,

00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:01.791
when the action doesn't take place,

00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:04.167
then it can be quite destructive...

00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:16.666
So the whole situation is different

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.375
in a country which is warm,

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:20.708
and a country which is not warm.

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:24.917
But in a country where it is very warm also,

00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:26.292
like Africa,

00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:29.708
there are complications due to too much of heat.

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:35.833
Like we have the tropic of -

00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:39.125
mean the equator passing through,

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:42.250
and it heats up that area so much

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.541
that it becomes full of jungles,

00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:49.499
very high trees and tall trees;

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:53.499
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:55.917
that there's no possibility

00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:02.250
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:05.125
and it's quite dark,

00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:06.791
it's full of darkness.

00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:11.209
So that extreme also comes in the same category

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:14.000
as the extreme of the cold season.

00:08:14.334 --> 00:08:16.209
Now such people live there

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:20.958
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.250
so they do not grow much;

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.334
and they can be primitive people

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.875
and they can be quite aggressive,

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.625
like they learn things from the animals

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:34.459
and they could be quite aggressive.

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.541
So the balance has to be struck,

00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:39.791
and the balance is that,

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:47.250
that we should desire and act.

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:52.958
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.459
there is a division of labor, I think,

00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:01.750
that one part of the country is thinking,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.500
another part of the country is acting.

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:09.334
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

00:09:09.791 --> 00:09:13.875
So a balance has to be struck where

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:17.417
you have the Sushumna working out.

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:20.875
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:25.250
one would say is the equator - it's not,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.625
is not the equator,

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:30.334
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:33.666
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.666
and that has to act;

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:38.750
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:44.666
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:49.375
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:51.250
like a big pole

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.375
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:58.583
There is nothing that is material

00:09:58.583 --> 00:10:01.958
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.583
but it's the energy force

00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:06.167
which acts in such a manner

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:10.917
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:14.250
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

00:10:14.583 --> 00:10:18.708
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

00:10:18.708 --> 00:10:22.292
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:23.958
to give us a balance.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.499
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:35.042
that half of the countries get the sun

00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:36.958
during the summer-time,

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.375
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:45.250
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

00:10:45.499 --> 00:10:46.417
Apart from that,

00:10:46.417 --> 00:10:51.167
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:55.791
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

00:10:56.167 --> 00:11:00.500
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:06.583
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:11.417
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:13.500
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

00:11:18.292 --> 00:11:23.042
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

00:11:23.042 --> 00:11:24.958
and all that takes place.

00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:27.708
This axis is the one which moves.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.791
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:35.666
moves the lava into different directions

00:11:36.334 --> 00:11:43.708
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.541
and also to have

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:54.209
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

00:11:54.541 --> 00:12:00.209
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:01.459
what is to be done.

00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:04.541
This axis is the one that loves us.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Because of this axis we,

00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:10.209
we have seasons.

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:13.875
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:16.958
different, different varieties of food

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.459
and varieties of things.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.459
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

00:12:24.666 --> 00:12:28.000
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.666
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.541
and we'll have no food, nothing,

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:38.500
and it will be like moon living here.

00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:41.666
Now it has been specially created:

00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:45.625
first the Mother Earth when it was created

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:48.541
through the heat of the sun,

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:53.334
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.541
Then she was brought very close to the moon

00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:00.625
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:02.209
it was all snow.

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:06.125
Then it was brought closer to the sun

00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:09.000
and moved at a point where

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.750
life could start working,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.209
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.417
to make life grow in that area.

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:20.625
Now when the life started growing,

00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:25.334
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

00:13:25.499 --> 00:13:28.917
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:31.125
because there's heat in the axis,

00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:34.250
the energy of heat that converts

00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:42.499
the plants into carbon.

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:45.375
Now this carbon is, later on

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:48.209
forms the basis for,

00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:50.917
we can say,

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:57.499
for the production of carbohydrates,

00:13:57.499 --> 00:13:58.750
you can say,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.334
or all organic matter.

00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:05.666
But to create life we had to have another help,

00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:07.250
is the nitrogen;

00:14:07.499 --> 00:14:10.791
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:14.917
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

00:14:15.334 --> 00:14:17.791
And when it created this nitrogen,

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.500
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:24.209
and when the amino acids were created within us,

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:31.541
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:36.042
Of course this was done in the ocean,

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:39.083
because in the ocean with the movement,

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:42.499
nitrogen was created and life was created,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.666
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:48.917
and that's how we have amino acids.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.625
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.625
gave us the combinations and permutations,

00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:56.917
different lives.

00:14:57.666 --> 00:15:00.209
So in the whole evolutionary process

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:04.209
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:06.666
In the same way in human beings,

00:15:06.917 --> 00:15:09.791
the axis is the most important thing.

00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:14.250
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:16.917
We have to stand on our axis.

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.750
Those who do not stand on their axis,

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.125
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:27.666
are capable of complete destruction;

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:30.791
because either they will be destroyed by

00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:34.541
too much of right side or too much of left side.

00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:39.375
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

00:15:39.666 --> 00:15:42.625
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:46.000
can have problems of different chakras,

00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:51.750
of different kind of quality in a person.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.958
A person who stretches his axis too much,

00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.000
puts back his head like this,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.250
is a person who is very right-sided

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.958
and creates problem with his ego;

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.334
and the one who absolutely bends down

00:16:05.334 --> 00:16:10.250
like a slavish person also is a person

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.791
who goes towards his destructiveness.

00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:17.666
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
one trying to dominate another,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.250
and when they start dominating another person

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.375
they actually destroy themselves,

00:16:26.375 --> 00:16:29.417
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:30.750
For example now,

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:35.250
we have seen that we had

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.334
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:41.875
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:43.708
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

00:16:43.708 --> 00:16:44.958
some other people.

00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:47.875
But everything that they did to dominate

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:49.958
and all that has double reactions.

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:52.541
First of all by their domination, say,

00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:54.625
Indians became very slavish,

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:58.209
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.083
and they do not have that independent axis

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:02.334
as they should have.

00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:04.625
Extremely slavish people they are.

00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:06.833
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:09.125
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:11.209
I find they are so very slavish.

00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:15.666
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:18.417
to please the white-skinned people.

00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:24.500
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.875
That added to the ego of the whites,

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:32.209
added to the ego of the whites,

00:17:32.209 --> 00:17:34.417
and today you see what's happening is

00:17:34.625 --> 00:17:36.500
all that ego is destroying them.

00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

00:17:40.209 --> 00:17:43.541
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:47.125
One has to understand that what is the best

00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:49.500
within a human being is his axis,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.459
and everybody has an axis,

00:17:51.666 --> 00:17:55.125
and one must respect the axis of every person.

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:59.500
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.209
I know you by your chakras,

00:18:02.209 --> 00:18:03.459
by your Sushumna,

00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:05.083
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:08.459
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:10.875
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

00:18:10.875 --> 00:18:14.292
I know you as a person with a very superficial

00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:16.500
type of a Sushumna.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.958
And even if you make up something

00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.417
by sort of being very nice or good,

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:26.625
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:28.875
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:33.083
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:35.459
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:37.500
I know how deep you are.

00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:40.541
So the depth on the axis

00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:42.875
is more important than anything else.

00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:46.625
Your axis has to be very deep.

00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:48.375
Now you will say that "Mother,

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:52.666
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:57.125
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:02.875
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.000
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.500
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:14.875
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:19.875
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:23.958
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

00:19:24.209 --> 00:19:25.666
and all the rest of them

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:30.625
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:33.541
while the people who are not deep, their outside

00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:39.666
what you call the foldings are bigger

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:42.541
than the inside small thing.

00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:46.459
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

00:19:46.459 --> 00:19:49.334
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

00:19:49.541 --> 00:19:51.500
may look to be very good-looking

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.750
or whatever it may be outwardly,

00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:57.125
but inwardly they are not deep.

00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:59.500
Inwardly if they are deep,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.375
their whole attitude is beautiful.

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:05.666
They are very joy-giving people,

00:20:06.209 --> 00:20:07.791
they are very joy-giving.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:12.500
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:15.958
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:19.334
but the joy won't be really that deep;

00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:22.083
it would be like a joy-killing.

00:20:24.083 --> 00:20:28.500
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:33.334
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:38.000
the proper effort we have to put in.

00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:43.666
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:49.334
and some people have very, very what you should say,

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:54.334
a very constricted type of the axis.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.000
This axis has to be grown.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.375
Now when you come for My puja and all that

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:01.250
I do expand it, I agree,

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:05.000
but it is temporary thing.

00:21:05.334 --> 00:21:10.083
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

00:21:10.334 --> 00:21:12.334
in the collective also.

00:21:12.334 --> 00:21:17.541
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.541
But it should be done seriously.

00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:22.750
It should not be just a joke,

00:21:23.125 --> 00:21:24.334
to be frivolous,

00:21:24.541 --> 00:21:27.000
to be stupid - that's not the way.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.875
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:33.666
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:36.875
it's a meditative thing;

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.125
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:42.125
it's a puja to God.

00:21:43.791 --> 00:21:46.500
Is to be done with that reverence,

00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:53.750
because reverence is the key of achievement.

00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:58.000
If you have no reverence about yourself

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.791
and no reverence of others,

00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:01.750
then it cannot be done.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.250
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.083
"What am I doing with my life?

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:08.375
Where am I wasting it?

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:09.500
Why should I waste it?

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.666
Why shouldn't I be deep?

00:22:11.666 --> 00:22:13.750
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.500
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:20.292
All these things if they pop into your head,

00:22:20.292 --> 00:22:24.292
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.708
because normally on small, small things people fight.

00:22:27.708 --> 00:22:31.875
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

00:22:31.875 --> 00:22:35.625
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:39.583
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:42.500
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:46.292
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.459
even if he doesn't show off much,

00:22:49.708 --> 00:22:52.292
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

00:22:52.625 --> 00:22:55.167
he expresses himself through his depth,

00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:58.083
because I can work out better through that.

00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:02.500
So to develop this one must meditate,

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.500
important thing is to meditate;

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.250
every day, every day, every day.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.250
You may not eat your food one day,

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.750
you may not sleep one day,

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.791
you may not go to your office one day,

00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:16.958
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:19.125
- but you must meditate every day.

00:23:19.125 --> 00:23:20.750
That's an important point,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:27.459
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:35.750
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:38.417
the first thing you will notice about yourself

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.500
that you do not care for any comfort,

00:23:42.459 --> 00:23:44.875
you're not bothered about any,

00:23:47.042 --> 00:23:48.917
any material thing.

00:23:49.375 --> 00:23:51.666
Whatever it is you are above it,

00:23:51.666 --> 00:23:53.917
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

00:23:53.917 --> 00:23:56.541
You just don't want to put your neck

00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:59.791
into a thing where you do not belong.

00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:01.625
You just get out of it,

00:24:01.625 --> 00:24:03.167
and you think that

00:24:03.917 --> 00:24:07.417
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:10.958
So your whole attention now moves inward.

00:24:11.209 --> 00:24:13.375
When the attention starts moving inward

00:24:13.583 --> 00:24:15.375
then it expands more.

00:24:15.583 --> 00:24:18.833
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

00:24:20.042 --> 00:24:23.708
and starts expanding and expanding.

00:24:24.292 --> 00:24:26.500
Now in small, small things also:

00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:28.417
say for example

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:32.541
if I have not mentioned somebody

00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:35.459
and mentioned somebody else,

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:38.000
then they feel,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.375
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:44.000
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.209
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

00:24:49.209 --> 00:24:52.541
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

00:24:52.833 --> 00:24:55.167
But these outward things are,

00:24:55.167 --> 00:24:57.417
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

00:24:57.417 --> 00:24:59.750
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.000
didn't do that."

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.500
All those things if it comes to your head,

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.334
that means absolutely it's true

00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:10.000
that there is something lacking in you.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.583
Or if you try to complain,

00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:15.292
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

00:25:15.292 --> 00:25:17.292
and I had to stand on this thing,"

00:25:17.292 --> 00:25:19.958
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

00:25:22.292 --> 00:25:24.750
This widening comforts you.

00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:27.417
That's the comforting thing,

00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:30.958
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:36.417
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

00:25:36.875 --> 00:25:42.625
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

00:25:45.334 --> 00:25:47.833
And this one has to develop,

00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:49.833
through meditative effort.

00:25:50.209 --> 00:25:54.042
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:56.625
as it is today is a collective happening.

00:25:57.459 --> 00:26:00.334
I find especially among Indian men,

00:26:00.334 --> 00:26:02.541
they never do any work with their hands,

00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:03.958
which is a wrong thing.

00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:06.750
Because they don't use their hands at all

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.334
Indians have the worst collectivity.

00:26:12.209 --> 00:26:13.500
If you have an ashram,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.167
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:16.833
nobody is going to stay there.

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:20.167
They want to have their own houses,

00:26:20.417 --> 00:26:21.499
their own families,

00:26:21.499 --> 00:26:23.083
their own children;

00:26:23.334 --> 00:26:25.833
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:29.833
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

00:26:30.292 --> 00:26:34.292
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.042
- leave alone repairing anything.

00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:41.167
They will stand with their hands on their hips

00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:45.167
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.083
There's a Marathi saying,

00:26:47.334 --> 00:26:49.875
a very interesting ....

00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:57.459
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

00:26:59.209 --> 00:27:01.541
So that is very typical of Indian men.

00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:03.209
They cannot repair anything,

00:27:03.209 --> 00:27:04.750
they cannot do anything.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.334
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:08.875
they'll just stand like this, watch,

00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:10.875
they'll never put their hands to it.

00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:14.125
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

00:27:14.125 --> 00:27:16.666
what we call as shramadaan.

00:27:18.125 --> 00:27:20.334
They have to do some shramadaan.

00:27:20.541 --> 00:27:24.375
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:28.875
and that is what we lack.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:34.499
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

00:27:34.499 --> 00:27:36.666
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

00:27:36.666 --> 00:27:39.125
try to put some garden around your house,

00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:40.917
try to paint your house,

00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:43.375
do some sort of a work with your hand

00:27:43.583 --> 00:27:46.541
which even if you don't have anything,

00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:50.666
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

00:27:50.666 --> 00:27:55.125
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:57.250
because I don't think people even do that.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.375
Even they don't shave themselves,

00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:01.875
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:04.791
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

00:28:05.042 --> 00:28:07.791
Now, but on the contrary

00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:10.750
we see in the West people use their hands.

00:28:11.042 --> 00:28:13.250
Because of that, you see,

00:28:13.499 --> 00:28:16.000
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

00:28:16.292 --> 00:28:19.250
So they score a point on being collective,

00:28:19.583 --> 00:28:21.375
while the Indians score a point because

00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:23.292
they are Indians and they have a heritage

00:28:23.292 --> 00:28:24.499
and they know what is Kundalini,

00:28:24.499 --> 00:28:26.833
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.042
So they score a point this side.

00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:30.958
So it's the left side is the desire,

00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:32.499
the right side is the action;

00:28:32.499 --> 00:28:35.375
again we come back to the same position where

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:36.791
we have an imbalance,

00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:39.167
that the action takes place in the West,

00:28:39.499 --> 00:28:44.083
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:46.958
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:50.583
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:53.250
Now we are building one single ashram

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.917
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

00:28:59.292 --> 00:29:02.334
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

00:29:06.209 --> 00:29:09.000
And it's so difficult, you see,

00:29:09.417 --> 00:29:11.541
to understand why they have taken so much time

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:14.000
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

00:29:14.459 --> 00:29:18.209
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.334
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

00:29:21.708 --> 00:29:24.000
everything is to be done tomorrow.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.334
"This we will do tomorrow."

00:29:25.334 --> 00:29:28.334
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:33.000
Like we used to have in the school,

00:29:33.292 --> 00:29:39.292
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

00:29:39.292 --> 00:29:42.500
see, there were: one house was built,

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.750
three persons came to work and one ran away.

00:29:46.209 --> 00:29:49.958
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

00:29:49.958 --> 00:29:51.292
and two ran away;

00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:55.541
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.167
So how, when will the house be finished?

00:29:58.417 --> 00:30:00.000
Never!

00:30:00.541 --> 00:30:05.833
With such runaways it can never be finished.

00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:07.000
It's like that.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.167
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

00:30:10.417 --> 00:30:12.875
I was saying that all Indians must find out

00:30:13.292 --> 00:30:17.083
some place where they could go and plant something.

00:30:17.541 --> 00:30:19.583
Get hold of some sort of a place

00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:23.708
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

00:30:24.167 --> 00:30:26.958
water it together, work it out together.

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.500
Now the Indian women are that way better.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.541
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:33.958
and all that,

00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:36.000
but the other part is missing.

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.209
The other part is intelligence,

00:30:38.459 --> 00:30:40.459
it's the other part is to think.

00:30:40.459 --> 00:30:43.083
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:46.292
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

00:30:46.292 --> 00:30:50.500
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.875
a lemon with his food.

00:30:51.875 --> 00:30:53.292
Now there's no lemon in the house.

00:30:53.292 --> 00:30:55.541
This woman would run up and down all over the place

00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:57.417
to get the lemon for the husband,

00:30:57.417 --> 00:30:59.292
otherwise he will not eat the food.

00:30:59.292 --> 00:31:00.000
Doesn't matter,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.875
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:07.334
But the women will try,

00:31:07.334 --> 00:31:09.541
because you see they must keep their,

00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:11.000
they understand one thing

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.833
that you must keep their palate all right.

00:31:12.833 --> 00:31:15.292
Then they are quite sensible in India

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.499
because here they're real tigers,

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:19.292
all the husbands are like tigers,

00:31:19.292 --> 00:31:21.583
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

00:31:21.583 --> 00:31:24.209
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:27.958
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

00:31:27.958 --> 00:31:29.417
the husbands are like,

00:31:29.417 --> 00:31:32.708
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:43.209
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

00:31:43.583 --> 00:31:45.042
and when they go to West,

00:31:45.042 --> 00:31:48.292
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.375
Something surprising how they change immediately

00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:54.167
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

00:31:54.167 --> 00:31:55.417
and all those things,

00:31:55.417 --> 00:31:57.042
but they become like that.

00:31:57.292 --> 00:32:00.750
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.708
when he doesn't understand

00:32:02.708 --> 00:32:05.042
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

00:32:05.042 --> 00:32:08.791
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

00:32:10.833 --> 00:32:13.625
This balance comes through our depth,

00:32:13.625 --> 00:32:15.833
and that depth has to be improved.

00:32:16.459 --> 00:32:21.375
Not through just by talking about it,

00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:23.541
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:26.917
but actually seriously doing meditation,

00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:29.666
actually seriously doing meditation.

00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:36.791
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

00:32:37.209 --> 00:32:40.042
Now we have in India, say, architects.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.666
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:47.791
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.000
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.666
And now they have problems, practical problems,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.167
they cannot nail one nail.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:33:00.209
All are what you call them as white-collar...

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.708
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

00:33:04.042 --> 00:33:06.500
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:09.499
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.750
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

00:33:13.708 --> 00:33:17.250
So under these circumstances one has to understand

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.708
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:24.833
as far as collectivity is concerned,

00:33:24.833 --> 00:33:26.500
so let us be collective.

00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:29.083
Let us try to do something collective.

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:32.500
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.917
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:41.083
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

00:33:41.083 --> 00:33:42.583
to their children nicely;

00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:46.917
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

00:33:50.292 --> 00:33:53.292
Now the other side is that the Western people

00:33:53.292 --> 00:33:55.833
care so much for collectivity that

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:58.167
whatever it is they try to compromise,

00:33:58.499 --> 00:34:01.250
and try to keep the family life all right.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.042
So it's the two extremes as we have.

00:34:05.417 --> 00:34:09.417
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

00:34:09.708 --> 00:34:11.499
the family life is going strong.

00:34:11.708 --> 00:34:15.791
But if you see such men in England,

00:34:15.791 --> 00:34:18.625
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:21.375
that Indian men do to their women here.

00:34:21.375 --> 00:34:27.250
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

00:34:27.583 --> 00:34:30.791
So the balance between the women and men:

00:34:31.083 --> 00:34:33.209
what is the axis, is the home.

00:34:34.417 --> 00:34:35.750
Home is the axis.

00:34:36.042 --> 00:34:38.833
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:40.583
What do you think about,

00:34:40.583 --> 00:34:42.083
what is your problem?

00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:43.958
Where is your attention,

00:34:44.292 --> 00:34:45.750
what do you discuss?

00:34:46.499 --> 00:34:48.292
That's very important to see.

00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:50.375
In that you'll find out

00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:52.583
what is going on in the family.

00:34:52.583 --> 00:34:55.250
Say you are talking ill of each other,

00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:58.958
if you are telling your child against your husband,

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.250
husband is telling the wife against,

00:35:01.583 --> 00:35:04.833
telling the children about, against the,

00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:09.625
against the husband, like that.

00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:11.334
If it is going on like that,

00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:12.625
then what happens,

00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:16.125
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

00:35:16.125 --> 00:35:18.334
The axis is love,

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:20.750
axis is love,

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.459
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:28.541
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.500
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:39.500
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.708
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:48.292
If people get realization before they are developed,

00:35:48.292 --> 00:35:52.334
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.666
We don't have to become communist,

00:35:54.666 --> 00:35:56.334
we don't have to do anything like that,

00:35:56.334 --> 00:35:58.499
because communists are just the same as Americans,

00:35:58.499 --> 00:36:01.250
there's no difference at all in temperament.

00:36:02.125 --> 00:36:05.666
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:07.875
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

00:36:07.875 --> 00:36:09.541
and if a Russian is sent to America

00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:12.250
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.666
There's no change at all.

00:36:14.666 --> 00:36:20.250
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

00:36:21.917 --> 00:36:25.541
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

00:36:26.917 --> 00:36:31.499
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.791
then any amount of development,

00:36:34.042 --> 00:36:36.042
any amount of all these things

00:36:36.541 --> 00:36:40.125
cannot destroy that country,

00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:41.750
cannot create wars.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.666
There will be peace everywhere,

00:36:43.666 --> 00:36:45.666
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:48.334
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

00:36:48.541 --> 00:36:51.250
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

00:36:51.499 --> 00:36:54.666
and we have to look forward to the new age

00:36:54.666 --> 00:37:02.250
of a new moon blessing us,

00:37:02.499 --> 00:37:05.541
and the great sun coming over

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.042
to give us all the energy we need,

00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:15.375
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:15.625 --> 00:37:17.499
May God bless you all.

00:37:25.958 --> 00:37:27.167
Now for the puja,

00:37:27.167 --> 00:37:29.209
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

00:37:29.209 --> 00:37:33.042
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

00:39:01.375 --> 00:39:02.958
From the foreign country,

00:39:02.958 --> 00:39:06.791
who is going to stay after the

00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:16.958
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:23.875
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

00:39:24.958 --> 00:39:29.833
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.125
All right, let's put it,

00:39:32.125 --> 00:39:36.209
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.417
When are these people going?

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.875
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

00:39:50.459 --> 00:39:53.833
when are they going, when are you going?

00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:59.500
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:02.500
What about you, John?

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.500
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.666
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:29.459
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

00:40:29.459 --> 00:40:33.833
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

00:40:34.958 --> 00:40:36.750
like that, in the near future,

00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:40.958
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

00:40:50.459 --> 00:40:53.625
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:04.541
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:07.875
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

00:41:07.875 --> 00:41:11.125
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

00:41:11.666 --> 00:41:13.209
It's not meant for ladies at all,

00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:15.625
and I have only one room where I live.

00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:18.625
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

00:41:26.958 --> 00:41:28.750
Let them go to Alibagh,

00:41:29.125 --> 00:41:32.083
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

00:41:32.459 --> 00:41:36.292
to people who will be looking after them.

00:41:36.666 --> 00:41:38.625
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

00:41:38.875 --> 00:41:42.417
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.334
Fifty, all right.

00:41:46.209 --> 00:41:49.833
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

00:41:53.958 --> 00:41:56.958
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

00:41:57.417 --> 00:41:58.541
You can come to Pratishthan

00:41:58.541 --> 00:42:00.541
if you want to take some photographs or things,

00:42:00.958 --> 00:42:03.125
but it's a liability for us because,

00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:05.459
you see, unless and until you go back,

00:42:05.666 --> 00:42:07.958
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:10.083
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

00:42:10.334 --> 00:42:12.666
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

00:42:13.125 --> 00:42:15.292
And then you'd better book yourself,

00:42:15.541 --> 00:42:18.083
because this must go out of our country,

00:42:18.417 --> 00:42:20.209
otherwise they're always on our head,

00:42:21.958 --> 00:42:23.500
and they are following us.

00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:26.833
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:29.125
stuff that you are carrying.

00:42:29.499 --> 00:42:32.250
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.250
You can finish the photography there,

00:42:36.499 --> 00:42:37.958
and you fix up your going.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.167
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:46.042
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

00:42:46.499 --> 00:42:47.833
Alibagh is better...

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:54.292
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.625
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.459
All right, so done.

00:43:10.459 --> 00:43:13.708
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

00:43:15.958 --> 00:43:18.292
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

00:43:18.292 --> 00:43:20.833
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

00:43:21.209 --> 00:43:23.083
and they can leave.
