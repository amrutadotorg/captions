WEBVTT

10:03.230 --> 10:08.130
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.110
Yesterday at the very outset,

10:18.240 --> 10:22.080
I told you that truth is what it is.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.190
If we have not found the truth

10:26.120 --> 10:29.120
we should be humble and honest about it,

10:30.010 --> 10:34.010
because truth is for our benevolence,

10:35.040 --> 10:38.170
for the benevolence of our city,

10:39.210 --> 10:41.120
of our society,

10:42.010 --> 10:45.180
of our country and of the whole universe.

10:46.150 --> 10:50.070
This is a very special time you are all born,

10:50.210 --> 10:56.210
where people have to get their Self-realization.

10:58.030 --> 11:01.170
This is the Resurrection Time as described in the Bible,

11:02.110 --> 11:06.220
it's the time of Kiyama as described by Mohammed Sahib.

11:08.110 --> 11:11.120
This is a very special time when Nala,

11:11.200 --> 11:14.000
as you know, Nala damayanthi akhyan -

11:14.150 --> 11:18.170
Nala was faced with Kali.

11:19.090 --> 11:22.070
He got very angry with Kali and said that

11:22.130 --> 11:25.120
"You have destroyed my family, you have destroyed my peace,

11:25.210 --> 11:28.120
and you put people into bhram,

11:28.240 --> 11:30.070
into illusions,

11:30.190 --> 11:33.160
so I'd better kill you."

11:37.190 --> 11:40.240
He challenged

11:41.190 --> 11:44.220
Kali that "You should be finished forever."

11:45.200 --> 11:49.140
Then Kali said, "All right, let me tell you my mahatmyam.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.150
Let me tell you why I should be there.

11:53.040 --> 12:01.040
If I convince you then you can stop killing me,

12:01.130 --> 12:03.240
but if I do not, you can kill me."

12:05.150 --> 12:11.010
So he told that "Today all those who are seeking the truth,

12:11.160 --> 12:14.180
seeking their Self-realization, Atma sakshatkara,

12:15.100 --> 12:18.110
those who are going into giri and kandharas,

12:18.240 --> 12:21.240
into the mountains and in the valleys,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.160
searching God all over the world;

12:26.100 --> 12:27.240
these people will be born

12:28.050 --> 12:32.060
as ordinary householders during Kali Yuga.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.060
There will be bhram, no doubt,

12:35.130 --> 12:37.110
people will be in sabhram.

12:38.010 --> 12:41.120
Illusion will be there, and the confusion will be there

12:41.120 --> 12:43.100
- that I will create, no doubt -

12:43.210 --> 12:46.200
but because of this confusion only,

12:47.090 --> 12:52.020
these simple householders will seek the truth.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.110
And that's why

12:55.230 --> 12:59.170
that is the time they will get their Atma sakshatkara."

13:00.240 --> 13:06.040
It's a - lots of prophecies have been there

13:06.150 --> 13:09.210
in our shastras about these times,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.020
but specially

13:15.020 --> 13:19.080
Bhrigumuni in "Nadigranth" has described about these times.

13:19.220 --> 13:24.130
If you tally them with the timing of today,

13:24.130 --> 13:27.120
it is exactly this time.

13:28.220 --> 13:33.030
After the death of Raghwindra Swami this will happen,

13:33.150 --> 13:35.210
and that's what is happening now.

13:36.180 --> 13:39.090
For you people it is very important to understand that

13:39.170 --> 13:44.130
Raghwindra Swami was in this area and he did a lot of work,

13:44.230 --> 13:48.120
and now the time has come to complete his work;

13:50.070 --> 13:53.000
also Ramana Maharshi.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.070
They didn't know how to explain,

13:55.130 --> 13:57.190
so they took to maunavart.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.020
People like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-three,

14:01.100 --> 14:03.100
writing such wonderful things,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.170
like "Amruta anubhavi ..." is a book,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.080
I think the last word on spirituality.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.020
They had to get into samadhis at a such a young age of

14:13.090 --> 14:14.220
twenty-three years,

14:15.080 --> 14:18.090
because nobody tried to understand them.

14:18.170 --> 14:19.230
So much of ritualism,

14:20.060 --> 14:21.070
so much of conditioning,

14:21.140 --> 14:24.030
so much of reading that nobody wanted to know

14:24.100 --> 14:25.100
what they were talking.

14:25.180 --> 14:28.020
Everybody thought, "We know everything,"

14:28.120 --> 14:32.240
and that's how this kind of a satisfaction that they had.

14:34.110 --> 14:35.140
Kabira has said,

14:35.210 --> 14:38.060
Kaise samjhaun, sab jag andhaa -

14:38.160 --> 14:41.190
"How am I to explain, the whole world is blind."

14:42.120 --> 14:47.140
But this is what we have to achieve in our evolution,

14:47.230 --> 14:50.200
this is what we have to jump into.

14:51.070 --> 14:55.070
To become the spirit is told by all the scriptures -

14:55.240 --> 14:58.090
not only India, everywhere.

14:58.180 --> 15:01.020
If you take Tao, if you take Zen,

15:01.100 --> 15:07.240
if you go to the Jewish or to the Christian philosophies,

15:08.070 --> 15:10.220
or to the Islamic, everywhere it is said

15:11.070 --> 15:13.100
that you have to become your Self,

15:13.210 --> 15:15.190
you have to have self-knowledge.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.110
Of course, anybody said like that,

15:18.190 --> 15:22.140
those people who are in charge of religion

15:22.220 --> 15:25.050
or at the helm of affairs, making money

15:25.150 --> 15:27.200
or creating power out of it,

15:28.030 --> 15:30.200
people using religion for power or money;

15:31.070 --> 15:34.060
they didn't like it, so they said, "They are heretics.

15:34.170 --> 15:37.200
This is blasphemy. They have no special knowledge."

15:38.040 --> 15:40.180
And that's how they have been punishing people,

15:41.010 --> 15:43.180
troubling people, torturing them.

15:46.010 --> 15:49.000
But the time has come now for all the seekers

15:49.160 --> 15:54.180
to get their Self-realization, Atma sakshatkara.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.060
Yesterday I told you how it works out

15:57.120 --> 15:59.060
through kundalini awakening.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.020
About kundalini people have written

16:02.080 --> 16:04.220
all kinds of nonsensical things which is not true.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.070
I am your Mother, I'm going to tell you truth,

16:07.130 --> 16:10.000
I'm not going to tell you something false.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.080
Even if you don't like it let Me tell you,

16:13.190 --> 16:16.000
because this is for your benevolence,

16:16.090 --> 16:18.200
for your good, for your hita.

16:21.220 --> 16:24.230
So when the kundalini rises,

16:25.230 --> 16:28.010
she passes through your

16:28.080 --> 16:30.190
different centers which are subtle centers,

16:31.120 --> 16:32.220
and nourishes them,

16:33.030 --> 16:35.030
pierces through your fontanel bone area

16:35.090 --> 16:38.000
and connects you to the all-pervading Power,

16:38.060 --> 16:40.030
about which we do not know.

16:41.150 --> 16:45.070
Then from your hands you feel vibrations,

16:45.210 --> 16:47.240
which are called as Chaitanya lahari.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.050
Adi Shankaracharya has called it "Saundarya lahari,"

16:54.140 --> 16:57.080
because you can judge the saundarya with this.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.140
Beautifully he has described it.

17:01.230 --> 17:04.010
But how much they tortured him

17:06.060 --> 17:07.170
- think of it,

17:08.010 --> 17:10.070
person like Adi Shankaracharya - I mean,

17:11.030 --> 17:12.160
I don't know what to say.

17:13.020 --> 17:17.050
The one who gave such secrets about the Mother,

17:17.190 --> 17:20.090
such great descriptions;

17:21.120 --> 17:23.190
he was tortured for what?

17:24.080 --> 17:27.090
What wrong did he do that he should have been tortured?

17:29.210 --> 17:34.010
Now we have to stand up with the truth,

17:34.100 --> 17:37.120
and must say that "Mother, we have to have the truth,

17:37.180 --> 17:39.150
and truth and nothing else."

17:41.020 --> 17:44.160
I told you yesterday that Atma

17:45.160 --> 17:48.080
is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart.

17:48.190 --> 17:50.220
In these days of scientific

17:51.100 --> 17:55.140
conditioning this is a new type, apart from the "dharmic"

17:56.050 --> 17:59.210
scientific conditioning in which every scientist thinks

18:00.020 --> 18:01.000
that he knows everything.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.190
They don't know anything, take it from Me.

18:07.010 --> 18:08.130
It's absurd.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.010
Now you have seen so many scientists

18:11.090 --> 18:12.230
coming up and telling you about Sahaja Yoga.

18:13.090 --> 18:16.170
They have accepted because they have experimented.

18:17.150 --> 18:21.090
I told them that Mooladhara Chakra,

18:21.150 --> 18:23.120
the first chakra, Mooladhara,

18:24.070 --> 18:26.070
is made of carbon atoms,

18:26.130 --> 18:28.160
because it is made of Prithvi (means earth)... tattwa.

18:29.070 --> 18:33.220
And if you photograph the carbon atom

18:36.000 --> 18:39.060
and make a model out of it

18:40.010 --> 18:42.050
and then take a photograph, say, from left side,

18:42.130 --> 18:44.040
you'll see the right side,

18:44.100 --> 18:48.160
and you'll see actually "Aum" written down.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.160
If you see it from the right side,

18:51.220 --> 18:54.160
on the left side you will see a swastika.

18:55.030 --> 18:57.080
But if you see from down upward,

18:57.190 --> 18:59.150
you will see a cross.

19:00.190 --> 19:04.130
There is, really I must tell you a Dr. Worlikar

19:04.210 --> 19:05.240
who is a very famous doctor,

19:06.050 --> 19:12.050
he missed his prize in the Nobel Prize because,

19:12.130 --> 19:13.220
perhaps, he was an Indian.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.100
He's the one who experimented with three,

19:16.180 --> 19:21.030
four other Sahaja yogi scientists, and they said it is so.

19:24.020 --> 19:25.100
It is so.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
There is such a little knowledge with these scientists,

19:32.060 --> 19:35.220
because they are seeing things from outside.

19:36.150 --> 19:39.150
With Sahaja Yoga you go from inside.

19:40.140 --> 19:43.070
And everybody says the same thing,

19:45.070 --> 19:48.020
because - now you see Me standing here

19:48.090 --> 19:50.210
wearing a white sari and a red border;

19:51.040 --> 19:52.180
everybody knows, everybody feels.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.210
I don't have to tell you, you know it,

19:55.080 --> 19:57.210
you see it and you see this is so.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.240
But once you get your realization,

20:00.050 --> 20:02.110
whatever you feel on your hands

20:03.190 --> 20:06.190
is felt by everyone the same.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.110
Even if you take ten children and tie up their eyes,

20:10.200 --> 20:13.150
ask them, "What is this gentleman suffering from?" -

20:14.010 --> 20:15.210
they don't know if it's a lady or a gentleman,

20:16.040 --> 20:19.180
eyes are tied up - they'll put supposing one finger like this.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.120
That means his Vishuddhi is bad.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.080
You ask the person, "Have you got throat trouble?" -

20:23.170 --> 20:25.120
"How do you know?"

20:26.090 --> 20:31.010
We know because this finger is Shri Krishna's finger,

20:31.150 --> 20:33.090
Shri Krishna's place,

20:33.240 --> 20:35.160
this is the throat.

20:36.150 --> 20:37.150
It all relates.

20:37.230 --> 20:42.180
Mythology is not all absurd.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.140
Ninety percent is absolutely what it was.

20:46.230 --> 20:49.170
Of course there are some absurd things that have walked in,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.010
but ninety percent mythology, so-called mythology

20:53.090 --> 20:55.070
is absolutely there.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
Now, we go to temples.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.070
We think, this is a temple, going is very good and all that.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.100
But we don't know what we are doing,

21:04.220 --> 21:07.100
what we are praying, whom are we praying,

21:07.160 --> 21:10.160
what are these deities, how they work in ourselves,

21:11.000 --> 21:16.030
where do they reside within ourselves, what is their job?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.170
How to please them?

21:19.150 --> 21:20.130
We don't know anything;

21:20.210 --> 21:23.000
but you ask these foreigners, they know everything.

21:25.150 --> 21:28.060
First of all they got fed up with Christianity,

21:28.150 --> 21:30.030
that's one thing.

21:30.180 --> 21:34.010
They just got fed up with all the nonsense they found out,

21:34.070 --> 21:36.120
because they're very intelligent, you can see,

21:37.120 --> 21:39.070
and their conditioning was much less.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.200
And they started thinking,

21:41.020 --> 21:44.120
"After all, we don't know why they do like this."

21:48.080 --> 21:50.080
Then they were just ready.

21:50.180 --> 21:53.160
At that time we exported lots of fake gurus -

21:54.020 --> 21:56.080
the West export is the fake gurus.

21:56.170 --> 22:00.160
Thank God we are saved, we are poor - that's a blessing.

22:02.060 --> 22:04.240
So lots of fake gurus went there and made a lot of money,

22:05.060 --> 22:07.040
and here also we had lots of them.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.200
I mean, we are just good at it, creating lots of fake gurus.

22:11.180 --> 22:13.190
And they befooled people one after another,

22:14.020 --> 22:15.110
made a lot of money.

22:15.190 --> 22:17.160
It's all money-oriented.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.230
In the beginning it was so difficult for Me

22:22.060 --> 22:25.190
because they all used to come with big gusto to fight Me,

22:26.010 --> 22:28.150
because I said you can't take money in the name of God -

22:28.220 --> 22:30.140
that was too much.

22:31.060 --> 22:34.030
"How can She say that you cannot take money?"

22:34.240 --> 22:36.180
But now it's better.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.210
One by one all of them got nicely exposed,

22:40.020 --> 22:41.120
and more will be exposed.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.140
I don't have to tell you about them;

22:43.220 --> 22:45.090
they will be exposed, one by one.

22:45.200 --> 22:49.060
If there is light, all darkness has to go,

22:49.150 --> 22:53.090
and everything that is there has to be exposed.

22:54.130 --> 22:56.240
So everyone feels the same,

22:57.240 --> 22:59.210
there is no quarrel about it;

23:00.080 --> 23:05.100
because the spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

23:06.140 --> 23:11.160
it's one God, who reflects Sadashiva.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.050
Sadashiva, who is a witness to the work of

23:15.110 --> 23:17.010
the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

23:17.120 --> 23:19.050
is just witnessing the play,

23:19.140 --> 23:20.190
just witnessing.

23:21.010 --> 23:23.000
In you He is witnessing as Atma,

23:23.060 --> 23:26.120
but He doesn't come into your attention, He's there.

23:28.040 --> 23:32.130
And His attention

23:33.210 --> 23:39.050
is only limited because He has not to

23:39.150 --> 23:44.160
any way interfere with your freedom.

23:45.010 --> 23:47.130
So He keeps to Himself, He is just watching.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.160
That is the "auto."

23:48.240 --> 23:51.020
When we say "autonomous nervous system" that is the auto,

23:51.090 --> 23:52.120
that's the spirit.

23:52.180 --> 23:56.190
Now it's the reflection of one Sadashiva.

23:57.050 --> 24:00.070
Naturally all the reflections have to be the same,

24:00.210 --> 24:03.000
their effects have to be the same.

24:03.130 --> 24:07.130
Of course, before realization is the reflection on a stone,

24:07.200 --> 24:10.200
we can call it, or on a wall,

24:11.050 --> 24:14.050
or maybe on some sort of a opaque thing.

24:14.180 --> 24:20.100
After realization you become reflectors,

24:20.210 --> 24:23.210
beautiful reflectors, and it reflects you.

24:24.070 --> 24:26.140
And everyone reflects the same thing.

24:26.240 --> 24:29.190
So the effect of Atma sakshatkara

24:30.020 --> 24:31.220
is the same on every person,

24:32.050 --> 24:35.050
that first he starts feeling this cool breeze in his hands,

24:35.120 --> 24:38.090
then out of his fontanel bone area.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.220
All of them feel the same way.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.120
Then they start feeling these centers

24:43.200 --> 24:46.170
and finding out what's wrong.

24:47.100 --> 24:52.230
Also all of them become thoughtlessly aware,

24:53.100 --> 24:57.020
first stage which we call as nirvichara samadhi.

24:57.130 --> 24:59.120
Instantaneously it works.

24:59.190 --> 25:02.000
You may say, "Mother, it's very difficult.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.150
How does it happen?

25:03.220 --> 25:05.060
People had to go to Himalayas."

25:05.120 --> 25:08.030
All right, it doesn't matter, you don't have to go.

25:09.070 --> 25:14.190
Those days are gone. After all, the civilization,

25:15.100 --> 25:18.110
this tree of civilization has grown so big,

25:18.170 --> 25:20.090
its roots have to be grown;

25:20.190 --> 25:23.060
otherwise the whole civilization will be finished.

25:23.140 --> 25:26.000
And this is the knowledge of the roots,

25:26.090 --> 25:29.110
and that's why to know this knowledge you have to become

25:29.230 --> 25:31.200
subtler, sukshma.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.100
This is only possible when the kundalini rises

25:35.180 --> 25:37.170
and pierces through your fontanel bone,

25:37.240 --> 25:42.120
and makes you connected with the the all-pervading Power

25:42.240 --> 25:44.150
of God's love.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.210
So the first thing that you feel

25:49.050 --> 25:51.190
is collective consciousness,

25:52.110 --> 25:54.170
because everybody is the spirit.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.240
So you can feel another Atma,

25:57.060 --> 25:59.080
you can feel another Atma, you can feel another.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.200
You can feel their body, you can feel their mind,

26:02.030 --> 26:03.200
you can feel anything.

26:06.130 --> 26:09.000
This is the first quality you get,

26:09.110 --> 26:12.070
samuhik chetana, on your nervous system,

26:12.140 --> 26:15.080
on your central nervous system.

26:17.130 --> 26:20.050
Whatever you have got in your evolution

26:20.110 --> 26:23.240
is expressed on your central nervous system.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.200
Now see:

26:26.020 --> 26:28.090
for example, if you have a dog or a horse

26:28.170 --> 26:31.170
and you want to take him through a very dirty lane,

26:33.030 --> 26:34.160
it will go, it won't bother.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.110
But for a human being it is very difficult,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.170
because in our evolution our central nervous system

26:41.000 --> 26:45.060
has developed the sense of smell, a sense of beauty.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.180
All right.

26:49.070 --> 26:50.200
So this they have developed,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.150
and once they have developed,

26:52.210 --> 26:55.100
what happens that

26:56.090 --> 27:01.010
now we human beings are definitely higher than animals

27:01.240 --> 27:07.000
in our evolution, and in our subtler sensitivities.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.020
For a dog it doesn't matter what you put here,

27:10.100 --> 27:13.160
how you decorate, what color you wear, nothing;

27:14.070 --> 27:16.150
to us it is very important,

27:17.150 --> 27:21.020
because our sensitivity has improved.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.070
It has improved

27:24.020 --> 27:26.100
because of our evolutionary process,

27:26.190 --> 27:29.020
we have become human beings.

27:31.060 --> 27:35.000
But in the human stage we have one problem,

27:35.080 --> 27:40.070
and that problem is that we have developed two institutions

27:40.150 --> 27:44.040
in our head and it's called as ego and superego,

27:44.120 --> 27:48.010
and you call the ego and the conditioning.

27:49.130 --> 27:54.080
These two institutions on our head cross over and calcify,

27:54.180 --> 27:58.100
and we become a closed personality.

28:00.070 --> 28:02.050
When the kundalini rises,

28:02.130 --> 28:04.110
she passes through this Agnya Chakra

28:04.190 --> 28:08.140
which is on the optic chiasma, and sucks in these two,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.110
opens the Sahasrara, and the kundalini goes out.

28:13.190 --> 28:18.030
This is a living process, this is not that you can do.

28:18.110 --> 28:20.040
Supposing you want to sow a seed,

28:20.120 --> 28:22.180
you cannot pull out a primule, the Ankura

28:23.000 --> 28:24.140
and push it into the thing.

28:24.210 --> 28:29.200
You cannot make the seed sprout.

28:30.010 --> 28:32.210
It's a living process of a living God,

28:33.160 --> 28:35.120
and of a living energy.

28:35.180 --> 28:38.110
Please understand, there's a big difference.

28:40.230 --> 28:45.110
So this is working out spontaneously,

28:46.100 --> 28:49.070
the rising of the kundalini. She is your Mother,

28:49.160 --> 28:53.100
she moves very beautifully without troubling you.

28:53.170 --> 28:55.110
She knows her child very well.

28:55.210 --> 28:58.220
This is the chance she has to give realization to you.

28:59.050 --> 29:02.110
She has loved you all her life, all your lives,

29:02.200 --> 29:05.010
and she knows all about you, all your problems;

29:05.070 --> 29:07.040
like, a naughty boy you have been -

29:07.120 --> 29:08.190
"It doesn't matter," she says,

29:09.010 --> 29:10.210
"this is the chance to give them realization."

29:11.040 --> 29:13.240
It is she who comes up well, beautifully,

29:14.080 --> 29:17.100
works it out, pierces through.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.160
All this happens.

29:21.130 --> 29:24.070
But when she touches the Brahmarandra

29:24.150 --> 29:26.160
or pierces through the Brahmarandra,

29:27.150 --> 29:31.070
then the seat of Sadashiva is here.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.200
He has a reflection here, but the seat is here.

29:34.020 --> 29:36.220
These are the peethas in our head, seven peethas,

29:37.200 --> 29:40.060
and the chakras are down below.

29:41.090 --> 29:43.180
So when she pierces through that,

29:44.130 --> 29:47.160
what we do is actually we have touched

29:47.220 --> 29:48.210
the Feet of Sadashiva,

29:49.020 --> 29:51.020
and that's how in our heart the spirit

29:51.100 --> 29:53.130
enters into our attention.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.210
When the spirit enters into our attention

29:57.020 --> 29:59.100
we become enlightened, our attention is enlightened,

30:00.150 --> 30:03.010
and this attention

30:05.210 --> 30:11.040
is very alert and it knows everything.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.060
Sitting down here you can find out about people,

30:14.140 --> 30:16.140
what they are doing, on the chakras.

30:16.230 --> 30:19.030
You will not discuss what clothes they are wearing,

30:19.110 --> 30:20.230
how much money they have in the bank,

30:21.070 --> 30:23.170
but they will see where are they on their chakras,

30:23.230 --> 30:26.200
what's the problem is. Sitting here you can cure them,

30:27.120 --> 30:29.150
sitting here you can help them.

30:30.020 --> 30:32.140
But they have to be one with this all-pervading Power,

30:32.210 --> 30:34.050
that is important.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.130
If they are not, then it takes some time.

30:41.080 --> 30:46.160
So first of all you become nirvichar, nirvichar samadhi,

30:47.030 --> 30:49.170
and you start working out your collective consciousness

30:50.010 --> 30:51.170
by giving realizations to others.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.210
You become entitled to raise this kundalini,

30:54.030 --> 30:55.240
with your hands you can raise the kundalini.

30:56.090 --> 30:58.140
You know these people who are singing here,

30:58.240 --> 31:02.020
some of them have given realization to a thousand people,

31:03.040 --> 31:05.070
and you can do it also,

31:06.170 --> 31:08.100
because now you have the power.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.130
But the problem is,

31:11.230 --> 31:13.200
you have been given the throne,

31:14.070 --> 31:16.150
you have been made to sit on that,

31:17.020 --> 31:21.190
now you have been also adorned with a beautiful

31:22.040 --> 31:23.020
mukuta (means crown).

31:23.100 --> 31:24.220
But still you don't want to believe

31:25.050 --> 31:27.130
you have become the king, now how to make you believe?

31:28.150 --> 31:33.040
So the second point is self-confidence, is very difficult.

31:33.230 --> 31:39.150
They cannot believe that they have got Self-realization.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.220
And "Go ahead with it, work it out.

31:43.030 --> 31:45.140
You have become your own guru, go ahead with it"

31:45.220 --> 31:47.130
- they cannot, they are afraid.

31:47.210 --> 31:51.140
But all these horrible cheats, they have no realization,

31:51.210 --> 31:53.100
they have no knowledge, nothing.

31:53.190 --> 31:55.030
They become the dead gurus,

31:55.110 --> 31:57.050
have thousands of people behind them,

31:57.130 --> 32:00.160
make fool of them, make money and spoil their lives.

32:01.090 --> 32:04.000
While those who are Sahaja yogis,

32:04.090 --> 32:06.230
who have all the knowledge, everything:

32:07.180 --> 32:13.200
still they are so humble, they are so simple.

32:16.130 --> 32:18.200
But they know about everyone.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.050
Anyone who comes there, they know,

32:21.120 --> 32:23.060
"Ah, we know this one."

32:23.200 --> 32:26.030
They won't say it but they know, all of them.

32:26.090 --> 32:28.120
In their own

32:29.210 --> 32:34.130
science they will tell you "this is this" - they know.

32:35.020 --> 32:38.100
Then collectively they will work for that person.

32:38.230 --> 32:42.180
You will not know what they are doing,

32:43.160 --> 32:45.110
and it will work out.

32:49.170 --> 32:55.170
So the second nature of the spirit,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.230
apart from that it is a collective being,

32:59.070 --> 33:01.100
it is an absolute being.

33:01.190 --> 33:03.150
We live in a relative world -

33:04.180 --> 33:08.140
this is good, this is bad, that is this, this is that.

33:09.130 --> 33:12.060
But it's an absolute being, in the sense,

33:12.190 --> 33:16.080
you put your hands towards a photograph:

33:17.080 --> 33:20.170
immediately, if it is made by a realized soul,

33:20.230 --> 33:22.220
you'll start getting the vibrations.

33:23.110 --> 33:26.110
Think of anyone - was that a realized soul?

33:26.210 --> 33:28.070
Just put your hands.

33:28.150 --> 33:31.200
There are many if - people who don't believe in God,

33:32.010 --> 33:35.010
if He's God, so-called, don't believe in God.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.170
I mean, it's most unscientific,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.160
but supposing they don't believe in God,

33:39.000 --> 33:42.190
they have to just ask, "Mother, is there God?" - finished,

33:43.110 --> 33:45.170
they get the vibrations.

33:46.090 --> 33:49.210
All things can be proved.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.110
There is Pramaan (means proof) for everything,

33:52.180 --> 33:57.130
Pramaan for all that is said so far.

34:01.240 --> 34:05.050
This is a very great thing that happens to you,

34:05.160 --> 34:09.140
that you get the Pramaan out of your chaitanya.

34:11.120 --> 34:17.240
Then this chitta which is so attentive,

34:18.130 --> 34:21.220
which is so dynamic, which is so effective,

34:23.070 --> 34:25.100
also purifies you.

34:25.220 --> 34:27.220
It knows where is your problem,

34:28.030 --> 34:31.030
what chakra is catching, they tell you.

34:32.010 --> 34:36.200
Like I was there in Delhi,

34:37.160 --> 34:40.060
they brought three boys. "Mother, their Agnya is catching.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.140
Somehow or other we cannot clear it."

34:43.000 --> 34:45.060
That means they're egoistical.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.210
They also said, "Yes, Mother, we have Agnyas catching,

34:48.030 --> 34:49.050
we've got headaches."

34:49.130 --> 34:52.050
They're egoistical, but they didn't say they're egoistical.

34:52.140 --> 34:53.140
And they themselves are saying,

34:53.220 --> 34:56.140
"Yes, Mother, our Agnya's catching. Please clear it out."

34:57.030 --> 34:59.200
So you are yourself saying, "I am egoistical."

35:01.170 --> 35:04.220
Because that pains you now that that ego is paining you;

35:05.060 --> 35:08.000
so, "Mother, clear us out, we can't clear out this Agnya."

35:08.070 --> 35:10.230
"All right, come along, I'll clear it out."

35:12.120 --> 35:14.200
So you start judging yourself.

35:15.150 --> 35:18.040
You know about yourself what's wrong with you.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.190
"My this Nabhi is catching,

35:21.020 --> 35:24.040
my that chakra is catching, my that chakra is catching."

35:25.220 --> 35:27.140
They all know about themselves,

35:27.200 --> 35:30.090
and they know how to clarify and clear it out,

35:30.210 --> 35:34.010
and work it out. So you cleanse yourself.

35:34.180 --> 35:37.230
But the greatest cleansing comes when you are collective.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.180
Many people take My photograph,

35:42.050 --> 35:45.150
"Mother, we do puja, we sit down and meditate;

35:45.220 --> 35:49.030
but still again I got this trouble."

35:50.070 --> 35:52.030
You have to be in the collective,

35:52.110 --> 35:55.140
that is a very important part of Sahaja Yoga.

35:56.130 --> 35:59.230
Because now, you see, you don't have to go to Himalayas,

36:00.110 --> 36:03.090
not have to go and jump in the Ganges.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.010
You don't have to do any fasting,

36:06.240 --> 36:09.050
you don't have to say any Japaas (means chants), nothing.

36:09.130 --> 36:11.130
Only one thing: you be collective.

36:12.050 --> 36:16.130
Collective is the ocean of the attention of Almighty.

36:17.020 --> 36:19.160
Once you are in the collective you get cleansed.

36:19.240 --> 36:22.060
Like My finger, supposing - is all right,

36:22.140 --> 36:24.120
but supposing a nail is cut out and thrown,

36:24.200 --> 36:27.220
it won't grow. Nobody will pay attention to it.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.230
So you have to come to the collective.

36:32.030 --> 36:33.190
There, ego comes in.

36:34.050 --> 36:37.130
There are people who are very big, rich,

36:37.210 --> 36:39.100
very well-educated,

36:39.170 --> 36:43.190
or politicians - you know, big, big, big, big, big people.

36:44.150 --> 36:46.150
They find it difficult

36:47.070 --> 36:50.070
to come down to a humble place, is a center.

36:50.190 --> 36:53.080
They want another palace to be created for them,

36:53.160 --> 36:56.020
"otherwise how can we go there?"

36:57.110 --> 36:59.050
It's Mother's house.

36:59.220 --> 37:02.030
Even if your mother is humble,

37:02.190 --> 37:04.240
she doesn't have much money - "All right, doesn't matter,

37:05.070 --> 37:07.010
it's my mother's house."

37:07.120 --> 37:10.110
And they don't come, and then they lose vibrations.

37:10.180 --> 37:13.030
This is a very common failing, specially in India,

37:13.110 --> 37:14.090
not in the West

37:14.180 --> 37:18.130
because they know what precious thing they have achieved.

37:18.240 --> 37:22.070
We have no idea as to what it is that we have achieved,

37:22.130 --> 37:24.100
our Atma sakshatkara.

37:25.010 --> 37:28.020
So again next year I come,

37:28.120 --> 37:31.040
"Mother, I have this problem, that problem.

37:31.110 --> 37:34.020
I've been meditating at home all right."

37:34.100 --> 37:36.170
If you don't come to the collective,

37:37.020 --> 37:38.170
you cannot cleanse yourself.

37:38.240 --> 37:42.080
That's the only way in Sahaja Yoga you can cleanse yourself,

37:42.160 --> 37:45.160
and you can be above everything else.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.180
So when the kundalini passes through your Agnya Chakra,

37:52.180 --> 37:55.200
you become thoughtlessly aware.

37:57.010 --> 38:01.010
A thought rises and falls, another thought rises and falls.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.150
Some come from the past, some come from the future;

38:04.230 --> 38:06.210
but we are not in the present.

38:07.050 --> 38:09.190
If I say "you be in the present," you cannot be.

38:11.110 --> 38:15.050
That's why kundalini awakening is a happening

38:17.030 --> 38:19.140
which attracts your attention inside.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.220
Just like this sari of Mine is the kundalini coming up -

38:23.050 --> 38:24.120
see now it's spread out like that;

38:24.190 --> 38:26.000
but when she's coming up

38:26.060 --> 38:28.110
she's pulling all the attention inside.

38:30.090 --> 38:31.230
And that's how your attention goes in.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.180
And when she pierces through,

38:35.070 --> 38:37.060
then there is a space in between

38:37.130 --> 38:39.130
the thought called as "vilamba"

38:40.040 --> 38:42.150
- this, of course, so everybody knows perhaps -

38:43.020 --> 38:45.090
that increases, that is the present.

38:45.180 --> 38:47.120
So we have to be in the vartamaan (means present),

38:47.180 --> 38:48.210
we have to be in the present,

38:49.040 --> 38:51.100
then we are thoughtless.

38:52.160 --> 38:56.140
Say the waves of water rising, falling,

38:56.240 --> 38:59.160
you are facing the water;

39:02.020 --> 39:04.220
but when you are in the water you are afraid,

39:05.060 --> 39:06.030
frightened,

39:06.120 --> 39:08.050
when you have problems you are frightened.

39:08.120 --> 39:12.170
But supposing somebody takes you out and puts you into a

39:12.230 --> 39:15.030
boat, then you see it,

39:15.210 --> 39:17.130
you can solve your problems.

39:17.210 --> 39:19.180
But supposing you know how to swim,

39:19.240 --> 39:23.020
you can jump down and save many others.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.040
So in three stages you move.

39:29.210 --> 39:31.140
So the growth only takes place

39:31.220 --> 39:33.040
when you are thoughtlessly aware.

39:33.110 --> 39:35.140
And that can be achieved in collectivity

39:35.220 --> 39:38.190
as well as in your meditation,

39:39.160 --> 39:41.160
for which you don't have to pay.

39:42.020 --> 39:45.230
Some people have an opening introduction lecture free,

39:46.080 --> 39:48.230
and then the second one is banking.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.030
Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.150
All this nonsense is not in Sahaja Yoga.

39:55.230 --> 39:59.090
It's reality, and reality cannot be purchased.

39:59.150 --> 40:01.050
Actually God doesn't know bank,

40:01.150 --> 40:03.120
He doesn't know money.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.140
He doesn't understand anything about money.

40:06.220 --> 40:10.080
He has not made money: this is your headache,not His.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.230
Of course, supposing I had to fly I have to pay,

40:15.060 --> 40:16.070
it is all right.

40:16.170 --> 40:18.170
If I have to get a hall I have to pay;

40:19.000 --> 40:21.120
but for the hall, not for God.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.180
For awakening,

40:27.100 --> 40:31.130
for enlightenment you cannot charge any fee.

40:32.040 --> 40:36.020
Even for darshan I am told people charge money - imagine.

40:38.170 --> 40:42.000
For them everything is money, money, money, money, money.

40:42.080 --> 40:45.170
How can they rise to the level of spirit?

40:48.010 --> 40:50.180
And we are so simple, you know,

40:51.060 --> 40:54.090
the bhaktas are so simple. "All right, you want five rupees,

40:54.180 --> 40:57.060
I'll sell my ring and give you.

40:57.170 --> 41:00.050
You want this, I'll give you this."

41:00.160 --> 41:03.100
There was a guru in America

41:04.080 --> 41:08.010
who had, I think, forty-eight Rolls Royce or something,

41:08.090 --> 41:10.000
I had forgotten the counts,

41:10.070 --> 41:12.170
and he wanted one more.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.180
So he told his disciples

41:16.060 --> 41:19.010
that "You should somehow or other get me one more

41:19.090 --> 41:21.180
Rolls Royce, then I'll come to England."

41:22.050 --> 41:24.160
So poor things were living on potatoes,

41:25.020 --> 41:26.130
starving themselves.

41:26.220 --> 41:29.040
So one of the Sahaja yogis said, "What are you doing?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.070
Why does he want a Rolls Royce?

41:31.170 --> 41:33.170
What is his interest in Rolls Royce?"

41:34.010 --> 41:36.230
He says, "You know, we are just giving him the metal,

41:37.060 --> 41:39.090
but he's giving us the spirit."

41:39.160 --> 41:40.160
Can you imagine it?

41:40.230 --> 41:42.190
Metal can be exchanged for spirit!

41:43.020 --> 41:45.020
Must be some sort of a bhoot badha

41:45.100 --> 41:46.160
he must be putting on them,

41:46.240 --> 41:48.220
and that in English language is "spirit."

41:49.070 --> 41:51.030
English language is very dangerous,

41:51.140 --> 41:58.160
because "spirit" is wine,

41:59.030 --> 42:02.230
"spirit" is Atma and "spirit" is a bhoot -

42:03.080 --> 42:05.180
I don't know which spirit they mean!

42:10.230 --> 42:12.160
So,

42:15.090 --> 42:19.190
the relationship

42:20.150 --> 42:24.090
with God if it has to establish,

42:24.180 --> 42:28.170
we have to become first of all the spirit;

42:29.180 --> 42:33.230
then only this relation can be established.

42:35.100 --> 42:39.160
One may certify oneself, "I am this, I am that"

42:40.020 --> 42:44.170
but it's no good, it is of no use;

42:45.080 --> 42:48.200
because this human body is given to you.

42:50.100 --> 42:55.020
Imagine what this divine Power must have done

42:55.100 --> 42:59.050
to make you a human being - how gently,

42:59.140 --> 43:04.110
carefully, beautifully you are made a human being.

43:06.230 --> 43:10.090
And now, why this human body you have got it?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.230
What are we using it for?

43:14.150 --> 43:18.210
We must evaluate our human life, what is it for?

43:19.090 --> 43:24.130
Is it for just insurance or I don't know what else they do;

43:24.220 --> 43:28.050
but is it for something,

43:28.190 --> 43:32.220
that we become the light of the world?

43:36.190 --> 43:41.200
So this light of the spirit spreads in the attention,

43:43.080 --> 43:48.230
and the attention becomes dynamic, active, works out,

43:49.060 --> 43:52.090
it's very alert and extremely punctual.

43:54.230 --> 44:01.100
Then this attention doesn't get bored at all.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.080
People don't know what is boredom is,

44:06.020 --> 44:11.000
because this boredom comes when your attention

44:11.100 --> 44:12.220
becomes tired.

44:13.100 --> 44:15.190
But here the attention is full of light,

44:16.020 --> 44:19.130
so they don't know what is boredom is.

44:22.050 --> 44:26.220
The second thing that is the nature of spirit is

44:28.130 --> 44:32.050
that it tells you the truth, the absolute truth,

44:34.010 --> 44:36.180
nothing but the truth.

44:38.240 --> 44:42.140
Anything that these chaitanya lahiris tell you,

44:42.210 --> 44:46.160
when you are matured enough, not before that;

44:47.000 --> 44:48.160
when your connection is complete -

44:48.230 --> 44:51.190
otherwise halfway you are connected and halfway you're not,

44:52.000 --> 44:53.090
then no - but when you are mature:

44:53.170 --> 44:57.000
that is the state of nirvikalpa.

44:57.150 --> 44:58.200
When you become that,

44:59.030 --> 45:01.230
then your attention is absolutely correct,

45:02.040 --> 45:05.120
your vibrations are correct and the report is absolutely correct,

45:05.210 --> 45:09.240
and what information you get is hundred percent truth;

45:12.080 --> 45:14.130
so the truth about anyone.

45:14.220 --> 45:19.000
Now, say we want to know about Shri Ganesh.

45:20.120 --> 45:22.110
We worship Shri Ganesh.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.140
Many people make fun of Him,

45:24.220 --> 45:27.090
even so-called intellectuals, you see.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.170
They don't know what to say,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.210
so they start saying nonsensical things about Shri Ganesha,

45:33.090 --> 45:35.180
you see - it's a sin.

45:38.020 --> 45:39.210
But you can ask,

45:40.120 --> 45:47.080
"Mother, is Gauri Putra is bestowed upon the Mooladhara,

45:47.180 --> 45:49.110
in ourselves?"

45:51.090 --> 45:52.180
Of course,

45:53.040 --> 45:56.070
all those who are realized will get tremendous vibrations,

45:56.200 --> 45:57.220
and you too.

45:58.030 --> 46:00.030
If you have doubts, if you are worshipping

46:00.110 --> 46:02.000
Shri Ganesha, you ask this question;

46:02.080 --> 46:06.140
if you are worshipping Shri Vishnu you ask that question.

46:06.220 --> 46:09.100
If you are worshipping Christ, you ask that question;

46:10.000 --> 46:13.030
if you are worshipping Shiva you ask that question.

46:14.200 --> 46:17.210
What's wrong with us, that without connection we are calling,

46:18.040 --> 46:22.090
"Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva" ? Is He in our pocket?

46:24.060 --> 46:27.210
How can you just - because is He our servant or what?

46:29.010 --> 46:32.040
But if you are realized, even taking once His name is sufficient;

46:32.150 --> 46:36.090
He acts, because we are in His kingdom.

46:39.030 --> 46:43.070
In this kingdom of yours, in the Indian kingdom that is there,

46:44.180 --> 46:47.200
you may call anybody; nobody will come in any case,

46:48.040 --> 46:49.230
the question doesn't arise.

46:51.180 --> 46:54.210
And when you start calling God also without connection,

46:55.040 --> 46:56.130
it won't act.

46:56.210 --> 46:58.240
But if you are connected,

47:00.140 --> 47:04.020
then not only that that deity will help,

47:04.080 --> 47:06.210
the one who is troubling you will be all right.

47:07.060 --> 47:11.080
Not only that, but whatever you want is done,

47:11.200 --> 47:13.110
and it happens.

47:15.110 --> 47:17.040
All kinds of manorathas (means wishes or desires)

47:17.120 --> 47:18.140
are fulfilled.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.200
So whether we should call it

47:21.040 --> 47:25.040
enlightenment or fulfillment is your own choice;

47:25.130 --> 47:28.120
it's complete fulfillment of your own being.

47:33.150 --> 47:40.020
So the third nature of the spirit is that it is love.

47:42.070 --> 47:44.210
Because it is love, it gives you joy.

47:45.050 --> 47:50.190
But nirvaj - this love doesn't want anything,

47:52.140 --> 47:57.090
it just gives; such a soothing, beautiful feeling.

47:57.170 --> 47:59.210
People have stress.

48:01.030 --> 48:04.170
After doing all kind of nonsensical things

48:04.240 --> 48:07.120
you will have stress, no doubt.

48:09.120 --> 48:14.050
But when the hole is made here, all your stress goes out.

48:14.210 --> 48:16.050
There's no more stress.

48:16.130 --> 48:17.240
We don't know what is stress is.

48:18.070 --> 48:20.040
People don't go to doctors,

48:21.070 --> 48:23.210
even the doctors don't go to doctors,

48:25.020 --> 48:26.030
they come to Me.

48:26.090 --> 48:29.090
I'm not a doctor, but they come to Me - surprising.

48:30.220 --> 48:34.090
This is meta-modern science,

48:34.170 --> 48:37.060
meta-modern - above modern science.

48:38.020 --> 48:41.070
But do you know, we are Indians,

48:41.190 --> 48:44.160
have this heritage of our own;

48:45.160 --> 48:48.130
we believe more in the English language,

48:49.050 --> 48:51.050
more in the English dress,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.090
more in the English knowledge,

48:55.070 --> 48:56.240
because we know English only.

48:57.100 --> 49:00.070
But those who know French will believe in French.

49:00.200 --> 49:03.240
Now the time has come that they should believe in us,

49:05.160 --> 49:07.220
because we don't believe in our own country,

49:08.070 --> 49:09.180
we don't believe in our own culture,

49:10.020 --> 49:14.110
we don't believe in our own knowledge.

49:15.190 --> 49:17.130
This is nothing new I am telling you.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.030
Sahaja Yoga is a very ancient -

49:20.160 --> 49:23.030
Nanaka sahaja samadhi [*]lago.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.060
Every saint has described.

49:31.030 --> 49:33.200
But we are doing this, that, all ritualism,

49:34.090 --> 49:36.230
karma kandis, this, that.

49:39.120 --> 49:45.090
This cannot give you the ultimate - cannot.

49:46.010 --> 49:48.190
I am telling you, that's the truth.

49:51.220 --> 49:56.110
Spirit is what we have to be.

49:56.180 --> 49:59.080
That's the ultimate goal of our life.

49:59.210 --> 50:03.080
Then the, all the rest of them fall in line.

50:04.230 --> 50:12.060
And that's what we have got from every scriptures,

50:12.150 --> 50:15.000
from every incarnation,

50:15.070 --> 50:17.170
from everywhere.

50:18.100 --> 50:23.210
Let us now just think that let us become the spirit,

50:24.230 --> 50:32.040
and then let us become a realized soul, a master.

50:33.150 --> 50:35.080
May God bless you all.

50:50.110 --> 50:52.210
They didn't bring any questions?

52:02.010 --> 52:04.150
There are some nice questions

52:06.070 --> 52:10.030
which I will answer before I give you realization.

52:10.160 --> 52:13.020
If you want to go out for five minutes you can go,

52:13.100 --> 52:15.090
and then you can come back.

52:15.190 --> 52:18.020
In the meanwhile there are questions.

52:18.110 --> 52:21.060
Should we focus our attention while meditating,

52:21.140 --> 52:23.110
on the top of the head?

52:23.200 --> 52:26.050
You don't have to focus anything anywhere.

52:26.150 --> 52:28.020
You're not doing anything,

52:28.100 --> 52:30.180
it is the kundalini which is coming up.

52:31.040 --> 52:34.190
So you don't have to do it. Don't fight with your attention.

52:35.020 --> 52:38.060
It will just - she will manage it. She knows her job.

52:39.190 --> 52:41.140
That's one point.

52:48.040 --> 52:52.010
Do the deities like Shri Ganesha, Mahavishnu etc.

52:52.090 --> 52:55.150
have the forms as depicted in our scriptures? Of course!

52:56.200 --> 52:58.130
That are the deities.

53:01.120 --> 53:05.210
Or do they stand for some state of mystic consciousness

53:06.090 --> 53:09.200
pertaining to yogic centers? Of course, they do.

53:12.090 --> 53:15.020
These deities are there.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.240
Ganesha is just like Ganesha.

53:21.150 --> 53:24.010
Of course, in color He differs from one to another -

53:24.090 --> 53:25.090
depends on.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.070
But

53:28.120 --> 53:33.150
His state of mystic consciousness is different

53:34.070 --> 53:36.160
from that of Vishnu,

53:38.180 --> 53:40.180
from that of Shiva.

53:41.050 --> 53:43.070
He does His job.

53:43.190 --> 53:49.060
Everybody is the perfect master of their jobs,

53:49.190 --> 53:51.230
but they are in the form,

53:52.080 --> 53:56.030
absolutely in the form as you know them, no doubt.

53:57.010 --> 53:59.210
What a blessing we have! I mean, imagine,

54:00.060 --> 54:02.180
I had to talk about Ganesha to these people,

54:03.010 --> 54:05.240
who had - they didn't know even the word "G"!

54:07.180 --> 54:10.010
Isn't it just ...?

54:10.100 --> 54:12.180
They didn't know anything about it.

54:13.130 --> 54:15.190
And they have mastered Ganesha.

54:16.040 --> 54:19.110
Now ask them, they'll tell you all the chakras, everything.

54:21.080 --> 54:24.040
All this knowledge is here in this country of ours,

54:24.120 --> 54:27.120
all these beautiful jewels are here.

54:29.140 --> 54:32.010
When we are in the midst of people

54:32.070 --> 54:33.170
not familiar with Sahaja Yoga,

54:33.240 --> 54:36.210
can we mentally imagine the form of Reverend Mataji,

54:37.050 --> 54:40.160
instead of keeping Her photo in front? Of course, you can.

54:45.170 --> 54:48.090
Yes, My photograph sometimes

54:50.040 --> 54:53.210
is used in very funny places

54:54.040 --> 54:56.190
that should not be such, it's not a protocol.

54:57.100 --> 55:00.080
It should be used in a place where

55:01.020 --> 55:04.130
you are with people who are Sahaja yogis,

55:05.020 --> 55:07.110
or in your houses, homes;

55:07.190 --> 55:10.080
you shouldn't use them everywhere.

55:17.090 --> 55:19.000
Now, this is a dangerous question! -

55:19.060 --> 55:21.200
Does non-vegetarian food affect the sadhana?

55:22.040 --> 55:24.060
Is vegetarian food is preferable?

55:24.130 --> 55:27.230
Now if I say anything you are going to be angry!

55:29.070 --> 55:30.190
But I'll tell you.

55:31.070 --> 55:37.020
In Sahaja Yoga, you are not supposed to eat any flesh of

55:37.100 --> 55:39.220
a bigger animal than yourself.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.220
If you are vegetarian, you could be vegetarian;

55:50.060 --> 55:52.050
if you are non-vegetarian you can be non-veg.

55:52.150 --> 55:55.180
But it depends on what sort of a personality you are.

55:56.090 --> 55:58.040
Supposing you are a right-sided person,

55:58.140 --> 56:00.170
you'd better be vegetarians.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.120
But if you are left-sided,

56:02.200 --> 56:04.100
it's better to take to proteins.

56:04.180 --> 56:06.210
So we're talking proteins and carbohydrates.

56:07.070 --> 56:08.150
Take any kind of proteins.

56:08.230 --> 56:12.100
Now we Indians don't eat any proteins.

56:15.130 --> 56:16.160
Except for Idli (a South indian dish)

56:16.240 --> 56:19.030
I don't think we eat any proteins.

56:19.140 --> 56:21.220
That too, we have rice with it.

56:23.050 --> 56:25.050
Proteins must be eaten by Indians,

56:25.130 --> 56:26.110
I am of that opinion,

56:26.190 --> 56:29.000
because we have become so weak.

56:30.060 --> 56:32.230
As it is, we are so frightened of income tax,

56:33.060 --> 56:35.030
this tax, tax;

56:35.200 --> 56:37.150
plus we are so weak,

56:37.230 --> 56:41.120
because we eat absolutely insipid food.

56:41.190 --> 56:43.190
So we should eat nourishing food,

56:44.020 --> 56:46.130
specially proteins in any form.

56:46.220 --> 56:50.000
But not the animal which is bigger than you.

56:51.140 --> 56:53.000
Like people eat horses -

56:53.080 --> 56:55.060
I don't know what else they'll be doing, anything;

56:55.140 --> 56:57.040
elephant, I think!

57:05.100 --> 57:08.180
For everyone there is no prescription.

57:09.150 --> 57:12.190
According to your nature you should eat.

57:13.220 --> 57:16.140
I mean, so many people don't do Sahaja Yoga when I say this,

57:16.220 --> 57:18.100
just imagine.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.100
They miss their Atma sakshatkara because of this.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.190
I mean, how did you become a vegetarian?

57:24.020 --> 57:25.240
Because your mother was a vegetarian,

57:26.190 --> 57:27.230
what else?

57:29.090 --> 57:31.040
From where did you learn vegetarianism?

57:31.120 --> 57:32.160
Supposing you were a Muslim,

57:32.240 --> 57:36.070
then you would have eaten somebody's heads also!

57:40.200 --> 57:44.190
So luckily you are born in a Hindu community,

57:45.020 --> 57:47.120
but we go too far with it.

57:48.010 --> 57:49.240
Morning till evening -

57:50.080 --> 57:54.000
I mean, this ritualism is so much in Madras also

57:54.080 --> 57:55.080
that they told Me,

57:55.140 --> 57:58.060
"Mother, Sahaja Yoga can never work in Madras."

57:58.140 --> 58:00.000
I said, "Why?"

58:00.090 --> 58:02.170
"Because people are not at all sahaj.

58:03.010 --> 58:05.010
In the morning they must get up at four o'clock,

58:05.070 --> 58:08.110
have their bath, go to the temple, come back.

58:08.210 --> 58:10.070
If one day they don't do it,

58:10.160 --> 58:13.130
then the whole day they are like mad people,

58:15.100 --> 58:17.130
thinking they have committed the greatest sin -

58:17.200 --> 58:19.170
this routine must be done."

58:20.030 --> 58:22.030
There is no routine in Sahaja Yoga.

58:22.130 --> 58:24.100
It's a living process.

58:25.130 --> 58:28.130
There is no routine in living process.

58:29.080 --> 58:32.030
Whenever the flower wants, it will flower.

58:34.060 --> 58:37.170
So why kill yourself with these rituals?

58:38.080 --> 58:40.190
This is our problem in the Hindu religion,

58:41.010 --> 58:42.060
the same with the Christians;

58:42.140 --> 58:44.220
I mean, everybody is competing.

58:47.040 --> 58:50.070
God has created this world for us to enjoy.

58:51.240 --> 58:52.200
I tell you,

58:53.010 --> 58:56.160
if you give up this you'll be very much absolutely relaxed.

58:57.040 --> 58:58.160
Forget it!

59:00.120 --> 59:02.130
At the most, five minutes in the morning

59:02.240 --> 59:04.020
Sahaja Yoga meditation,

59:04.080 --> 59:07.030
and ten minutes in the evening before sleeping - finished.

59:07.110 --> 59:08.190
For that we have a center,

59:09.030 --> 59:11.160
you go and see them - that's all.

59:13.060 --> 59:15.170
The rest God will do for you.

59:20.040 --> 59:21.130
Now this is a nice question also -

59:21.200 --> 59:23.210
What is the final realization in sadhana?

59:24.050 --> 59:26.040
How should one proceed in that direction,

59:26.120 --> 59:29.190
after he feels the vibrations in his head and palms,

59:30.070 --> 59:31.140
initially? That's good,

59:31.200 --> 59:33.100
that means you have felt it, Mr. Subramaniam,

59:33.170 --> 59:35.040
and I'm happy to know about this.

59:35.040 --> 59:38.240
But I would say that you have to come to our center

59:39.070 --> 59:40.130
and proceed with it.

59:40.190 --> 59:43.100
But we don't talk of the future,

59:44.190 --> 59:46.180
we talk of the present.

59:47.230 --> 59:51.040
Slowly you will be surprised how you are rising,

59:53.010 --> 59:57.120
how you are really getting all the powers in yourself.

59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.180
You yourself will realize, and you will be amazed.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.100
I mean, you'll be surprised,

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:05.110
some people I have met after one year -

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.220
I have a very good memory,

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.140
but I could not recognize them.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:25.090
Now, this gentleman is here,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.130
and he's something personal problem,

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:30.020
poor thing.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.090
He went to this Navoli of Hatha Yoga,

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.160
and he's suffering.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:39.220
This Hatha Yoga is another funny stuff.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.160
If you read Patanjali,

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.140
you'll know it's Ashtanga Yoga.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.100
Out of this exercises, wee, wee, wee, wee,

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:52.000
wee bit of that is so important.

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.190
Anybody can come and teach you Hatha Yoga;

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.190
unless and until he's a realized soul,

01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:59.140
he has no right to teach you anything.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:03.210
What I've said today is nirvichar samadhi,

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.070
nirvikalpa - all is written there,

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:09.020
and he calls all this all-pervading Power

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.090
as ritambara pragya.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:17.130
Somebody teaches you something - "Ha, tha" - finished.

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:22.060
People are running like mad, jumping like mad.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.220
You become right-sided, then you get heart attacks;

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.190
now this gentleman has a problem.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.030
But I assure you, you'll be all right.

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:31.030
You take to Sahaja Yoga, it's very simple,

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:33.100
it will give you a balance, you'll be all right.

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:39.140
Then Hatha Yoga, then going Gayatri Mantra:

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:41.110
you become more right-sided.

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:44.060
Learn what is needed for you.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.030
For a person who is right-sided,

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.070
you have to have bhakti.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.100
Those who are left-sided have to have this.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.180
You have to give balance to yourself.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.070
And it will really give you such a joy.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.190
Otherwise if there's some Hatha yogi,

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.030
you'd better approach him with a barge-pole;

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:09.060
God knows when he will slap you - like Duruwasha

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.200
It's very dangerous people.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.010
They don't know what is love is,

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:20.070
they don't know what is Mother is.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.230
There's no talk of love.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.080
Is self-awareness

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:42.030
a pre-requisite to practice on progress of

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:46.140
realizing kundalini shakti? No.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.120
After realization you become self-aware.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:53.040
Nothing is needed.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.130
Now for example, people go on telling,

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.160
"You have committed this sin. All right,

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:04.130
pay so much money to me and all your sins will be finished."

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.110
I tell you, put him to the police.

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:15.030
To Me nobody is a sinner, no. You are My children.

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:17.210
Nobody is a sinner.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.230
You have committed no sins, no wrong, nothing.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.150
You were mistaking something,

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:27.000
you went into darkness;

01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:33.140
or I can say that you were ignorant, at the most.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.230
But I don't like to call any human being as a sinner,

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.070
except for they're rakshasas.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.230
Of course there are rakshasas,

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:42.130
then they are already branded,

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:46.130
you don't have to say it, they're already there.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:52.140
So this self-awareness is what you have to get.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:55.030
We are not self-aware.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:58.160
By doing it, we cannot.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.230
When we say, "I have to be self-aware.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:03.060
Now I have to be self-aware, I have to go inside" -

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.050
what are we using? Our ego.

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:11.140
It's a happening.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.090
When you will achieve that state,

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:17.090
that state - not human state,

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.230
but a state of a yogi -

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:25.150
there at that state you have self-awareness,

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:28.210
and you respect yourself.

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:31.240
You have your self-esteem.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.060
But you don't show off,

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:36.110
you don't become cheapish person.

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.000
He says that "Mother,

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.070
I have recently started meditating in the Sahaja way,

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:20.200
and I feel absolutely fresh and beautiful all the time.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:22.240
Though, Mother, put very humbly,

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:25.230
say that the energy is our own,

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:29.090
I have never felt this energy before.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:33.230
Mother, so kindly let us know if we are

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.120
re-linked to the God or the main source,

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:43.020
and that is the reason why we feel full of energy

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.160
throughout?"

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.020
Of course, you are feeling because you are re-linked,

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.130
no doubt about it.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.230
But you don't feel any energy because

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:56.000
you must be a very good man.

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:59.040
When there is obstruction,

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:03.120
then only you feel a little problem.

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:05.230
Like a smooth landing,

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.060
you don't feel it;

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.120
if you get a smooth landing in Sahaja Yoga,

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:13.040
means you are a very nice person,

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:16.020
very good man, righteous man.

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:20.100
Just smoothly you land, there's no obstruction, nothing.

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:22.020
You have no imbalances,

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.130
you are in the center, no problem.

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:27.060
But if you have problems,

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:32.090
then the kundalini a little bit goes, comes down.

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:37.140
And that's why you don't feel it.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.040
Those who have problems

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.180
do feel a little pain sometimes here and there.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.030
But if the kundalini just rises up,

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:50.100
know that you are righteous, you are good.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.230
Is the term "God" given to all unexplainable questions

01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:07.070
as their explanation manas? No, no, no.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.210
In Sahaja Yoga everything is explained

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:13.020
and can be proved Pramana.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.110
Has anyone seen, heard, felt or realized

01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:29.010
his ultimate control, master, owner, decision-maker?

01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:33.230
Of course! So many of them, don't you know?

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.100
There are so many.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.160
Does the final authority lives outside every man,

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.160
or does it reside inside everyone?

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:55.030
He is reflected in everyone,

01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:03.060
but the reflection cannot be the object.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.160
But the reflection can be equal to the object,

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:10.030
depending on the reflector.

01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:21.130
If anyone has realized the ultimate truth, why did he die?

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:43.020
These are big, big things he has asked.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:44.210
You see, I think the gentleman

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.150
who is asking Me this question,

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:49.080
I would ask him first of all to get your realization.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.190
He's quite confused gentleman.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.130
You see, just now - "What is God? What is death?"

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.070
What are you?

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.160
Find out first.

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.170
Who is asking this question? ....

01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:14.050
He is asking from a center? Oh, my God!

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.040
It's interesting, eh,

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.200
that he's asking from a center all these questions.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.100
That means he's too much thinking, thinking, thinking.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:39.230
Is wrong to say that God is in good?

01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:42.200
I think he's done too much reading,

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.190
that's the problem.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.160
First you know the reality, My child,

01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:54.020
then all these questions will disappear - nirvikalpa. ....

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:13.100
Now he's talking about ideal good and all that.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.010
It's definitely true that man lives only once ...

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:28.100
It's wrong. Who told you that? He doesn't.

01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:33.140
But if you believe in that I cannot help it,

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:35.140
but it's not so.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.130
And that to be good and to be righteous

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.010
is not the end of your search.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:49.060
Dharma is the balance,

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.070
that gives you the balance.

01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:55.030
But balance for what, dharma for what?

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.210
We should ask the question.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.240
Why should we be dharmic; why not be adharmic?

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:04.220
Why not ask such a question? It's logical.

01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:09.020
Why do all this dharma, dharma, dharma?

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.020
Because you have to rise.

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:16.030
Say an aeroplane is not balanced,

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:17.160
how will it rise?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.090
But supposing it is only balanced and never rises,

01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:24.090
what's the use of making an aeroplane?

01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:27.150
So you have to be dharmateet.

01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:30.010
You have to go beyond dharma,

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.200
you have to go beyond gunas - it's gunateet -

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:38.150
you cross over, then dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:42.120
You don't have to tell yourself, "Don't do this, don't ..."

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.220
No, you just don't do it, try anything.

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:50.210
I'll tell you My own example.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.010
You know I have a double life.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.180
My husband is a - what is he, you must have known about him

01:11:58.030 --> 01:12:00.230
- he's a big, big, big boss of something,

01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:07.070
and I've lived with all that nonsense all My life.

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:12.030
When he went to England

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:16.180
they asked him, "Why don't you have dancing with us?"

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:18.170
He said, "Because my wife doesn't dance,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.150
I don't want to dance." He puts everything on Me,

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:23.090
it's a very good way of escaping!

01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:26.120
So they said, "No, no, bring Her to London,

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200
She'll be all right.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.130
If you bring Her to London She'll start dancing."

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:32.080
He said, "You even take Her to moon, She will not!"

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:38.170
So this is what it is. The dharma is innate, you just don't do it.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.140
Not because of conditioning, or it's better - it is Sahaj.

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:48.030
Sahaja, you - just, you just don't do it.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.170
"No, I will not do that."

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:54.030
You will never do wrong things,

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.100
because you will just not do it.

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:04.070
So this has to go beyond dharma,

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:06.080
means the dharma is part and parcel of that.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:11.050
Gunateet means you are beyond gunas.

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.100
You are neither right-sided, left-sided, centered,

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:18.000
but you are beyond.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.190
What is left, right, center, what is this,

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:24.020
why to hang like that? - better be above.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.030
That is what happens to you.

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.050
So "only there are righteous people":

01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.160
many righteous people came and went away,

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:34.050
had no effect on the public.

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:40.190
What is needed is your emancipation, your ascent;

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.080
that's what we have to achieve.

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.030
"Only the good" - so-called good;

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:51.150
and you cannot establish good, I tell you.

01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:55.150
Nobody likes to follow a good person.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.100
Like in Pune they were saying,

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:05.100
"Everybody takes - they eats money, they never eat food."

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.210
I said, "Really?"

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.070
So I told My husband,

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.070
"Everybody eats money" - he was in London.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.190
He said, "You tell them “My husband never took any bribe.'"

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.030
So I told them, "My husband never took any bribe."

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:19.220
They said, "Why didn't he take? Who told him not to take?"

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:26.190
So what happens is

01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:31.080
that normally people never follow a person who is

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.020
good and righteous, never.

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:38.220
But they'll always follow a person who is a

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:40.030
little bit like this.

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:44.070
The reason is, we are coming from animal stage -

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.070
easy to go back.

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:54.190
But once you're realized, then it's difficult;

01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:58.110
means once the flower becomes the fruit,

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.220
it cannot become the flower - as simple as that.

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:09.100
So I say you've come here, all right, very sweetly,

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:14.060
and then get your realization; then I'll talk to you.

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:16.230
Then you yourself will say - and now,

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:18.120
see these people who were singing here,

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:22.070
some of them were terrible drug addicts, terrible!

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:24.020
They couldn't even see Me. They said,

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.010
"We saw these lights coming out of You,

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.220
never saw You" when they came - in comas.

01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:34.180
Overnight, finished - alcoholics, overnight.

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:36.180
I didn't tell them. I never tell,

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:39.100
"Don't drink, don't ..." I never use that word.

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:43.180
Let the light of your spirit come in, and you are there.

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.100
I don't have to tell you anything,

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:50.080
all habits you'll drop by yourself.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.020
Do you see the point?

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.130
Because when the light comes in,

01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:03.050
the darkness has to run away.

01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:08.010
So righteousness is not sufficient enough.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.150
You have to go beyond that.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.050
Somebody has written about his friend who has a problem,

01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:37.170
who's fallen down, had an accident.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.190
He should go and ask the Sahaja yogis to help him.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:46.040
Nowadays I don't cure people, because there's no need to;

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:49.040
I'm doing all other nonsensical things.

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:53.010
The curing nowadays' done by Sahaja yogis.

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:58.010
There are so many other things I have to see to.

01:16:58.150 --> 01:16:59.200
So you call anyone,

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.010
they'll be very helpful and they will do it.

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:10.050
Ah, it's a good question -

01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:15.180
Is it possible to cure the suffering and poor

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.100
with this Sahaja Yoga?

01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:19.220
Can we get rid of our poverty?

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.110
We can, by all means -

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.010
if you stop fasting first.

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:34.050
You want to fast? "All right," God says, "all right, go ahead.

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:38.110
You'll not get food." Finished! Your wish will be fulfilled.

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.220
You want to become like a sanyasi?

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:45.240
Want to wear torn clothes? All right, have poverty.

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.060
You want poverty, after all you asked for it.

01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:58.000
Then, you want sufferings? "We must suffer."

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:00.170
There's so many nonsensical things going on

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.080
that "you must suffer." Then how?

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:07.080
"I have suffer " - all right, if you want that, you enjoy it.

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.210
You ask for prosperity, you'll get it,

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:16.010
after kundalini awakening.

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:19.130
You see the center there, called as the Nabhi Chakra,

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:22.160
and who is sitting there is Lakshmi Narayana.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.010
Once Lakshmi Narayana is awakened within you,

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.210
how can you be poor?

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.190
But also money has its own problems.

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:43.030
You get wealth, which is satisfying.

01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:48.060
But don't ask for poverty.

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:53.040
Leave alone you, now the Westerners have got

01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:56.180
a great desire for poverty.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.210
They wear pants, they said they are holey,

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.180
means there are holes.

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.020
Torn pants they wear - in England, imagine,

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:09.070
such a cold country, wearing holey pants,

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.220
getting varicose veins.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.080
And so many nonsensical suffering is going on there,

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.060
so many.

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.190
(Such a long letter - should write small one.)

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:29.170
So that's going on, and that's how people ask for it.

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:33.060
So there is recession in America, recession in England,

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:37.140
recession in Spain, crawling into France - have it.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:40.070
If you want to have poverty, have it.

01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:44.090
So the Lakshmi chit is going to come this side, I think.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.020
Some sense is coming into our government,

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:53.080
and I'm sure it will work out - hope so.

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:56.080
But you take to Sahaja Yoga and you'll be surprised.

01:19:56.210 --> 01:20:00.190
For example, in England we have such a lot of unemployment,

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.200
but not one Sahaja yogi is unemployed, not one.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.150
At least with this fellow one at least ...

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.150
he will take to Sahaja Yoga, to begin with.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:27.070
Mother, Sahaja Yoga is for health and joy

01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:31.010
only, or is it something more? Everything - totality.

01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:32.210
What do you want?

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:35.110
Ask for it,

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:42.000
desire for it - everything.

01:20:56.210 --> 01:20:58.170
He says it's not explained to him.

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.230
You see, just now I'll give you realization,

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.200
you will see how the chakras are opened out and all that.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:06.120
But later on if you go to the center you can know

01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:10.100
everything, in one year you'll be all masters.

01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:13.240
But give some time to yourself, is the point.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:15.190
People are very busy these days.

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:17.060
What are you doing?

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:21.060
Some ladies told Me they're very busy with [*]kitty parties!

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.110
Here are very few ladies in here,

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:30.110
Madras; all the ladies must be in the temple sitting,

01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:34.120
cutting, shaving their heads.

01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:41.120
And very educated women also do it.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.020
I mean, why, why should we shave your head?

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:47.070
God has lots of hair - you don't have to cut.

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:51.100
All this nonsense!

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:59.080
Women can be much more shakti shali than men,

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.080
but this conditioning of the women of India - God knows.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.070
All right. So now we are ...

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.010
He's saying, "I have been practising pranayama

01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:23.120
for four years. I don't have teacher ..." Very dangerous.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:28.180
If you have no teacher, whether you have teacher or not,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.220
pranayama is very dangerous.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:40.060
Ha! If you have problem with your lungs,

01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:43.060
or some specific reason ....

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.060
You see, all these vyayamas (means exercise),

01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:49.070
were given for specific reason, for specific chakras.

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:50.220
Now, the kundalini's rising;

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.240
supposing she stops at your stomach, Nabhi,

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:58.130
and you are doing pranayama, what's the use?

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.190
You should know where the kundalini is there.

01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:06.050
For example, today I was coming by car.

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:12.180
Now they stopped Me at one point, then at second point.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.140
When the car started moving,

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:17.050
then only I knew where it is going to stop.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.060
Beforehand, how can I do it?

01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:22.170
In the same way,

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:25.050
when kundalini rises - use your brains! -

01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:27.010
then she stops at a point,

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:33.010
then you should know by what vyayama you can put it right.

01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:35.040
It's very scientific.

01:23:35.150 --> 01:23:40.060
We too use, but not like all the medicines from

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:43.070
the medicine box taking,

01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:45.120
morning till evening.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.200
And that's why they say they develop problems - they do.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.030
You will, very soon.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.240
It's a very dangerous thing.

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:15.190
You see, actually we are not only physical being.

01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:19.110
We don't live in only on prana - that's right.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.070
I've seen people who practise pranayama,

01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.120
if they're married - thank God you're not married -

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.180
they divorce their wives,

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.030
because there's no love.

01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:36.170
They're very dry people, extremely dried up;

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.090
no poetry in their life.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.010
All right, you'd better start reading some nice poetry!

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120
Now, he is saying there -

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.210
"Could you please tell what is right-sided and left-sided?"

01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.040
It's quite a long subject,

01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:59.080
but if you go to Sahaja Yoga they will tell you.

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:06.190
Right-sided is physical and emotional energy,

01:25:07.050 --> 01:25:13.030
used for physical and - sorry, physical and mental work.

01:25:13.170 --> 01:25:17.030
Left-sided is the energy for emotions.

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:19.040
Now for example, he's doing pranayama.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.000
He's doing that, he'll become right-sided -

01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:26.210
only if you do that.

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:43.220
When the kundalini is in the process of awakening,

01:25:44.130 --> 01:25:46.000
is one getting fear?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.140
No, you do not. She's your mother.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.190
She will bear all the problems.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.220
When you were born, your mother bore all the problems,

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:56.220
all the labor pains. She didn't trouble you, did she?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.120
She, poor thing, suffered for you.

01:26:02.210 --> 01:26:04.230
And once you are born she forgets everything,

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.060
"That's - my child is born now, finished.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.070
Whatever is over is over."

01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:11.070
That's what is kundalini.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.140
Why should you have any fear?

01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:16.010
This is people who are telling you that

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.210
kundalini awakening is very dangerous and all that,

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.130
because they don't know anything about it.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.120
They don't want you to get your realization.

01:26:32.190 --> 01:26:34.100
What he says is true,

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:39.000
that - [Question:"Evil exists from time immemorial,

01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:47.060
in spite of several incarnations and saints."]

01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:50.180
It's correct;

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.180
but there is a solution.

01:26:54.130 --> 01:26:57.240
So why not seek the solution, to get out of evil?

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:02.120
Once you are a realized soul,

01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:05.130
the evil will run away - not you.

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:15.210
The time has come for all the evil to run away,

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.130
to be destroyed, to be exposed, to be finished.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:22.150
It's you who can do it.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:30.000
Everything takes its own time, like the growth of a tree.

01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:35.170
Slowly, slowly all these six chakras were worked out.

01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:39.020
Now the question of the seventh chakra, is the Sahasrara,

01:27:39.150 --> 01:27:42.010
which is now worked out in Sahaja Yoga.

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:46.190
So the picture is complete.

01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:56.020
Evil cannot destroy a Sahaja yogi; they know it very well.

01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:00.170
Even the evil know that they cannot.

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:05.090
If they see a Sahaja yogi, they run away.

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.230
So don't you worry.

01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:20.240
I think I have answered all your questions,

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.010
most of them;

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.160
but there's one thing.

01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:34.060
I've been doing this for the last (how many years?) -

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.200
twenty-three years, twenty-one years,

01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:44.090
answering questions.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.010
I'm quite now clever,

01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:52.170
I can answer any question, that's true.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:56.200
But this is no guarantee for your awakening,

01:28:57.030 --> 01:29:00.080
I must tell you. It's a mental acrobat.

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.160
So though I have answered your question,

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.060
doesn't mean that I will raise your kundalini,

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:11.090
or kundalini will rise.

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:14.000
That's a separate issue altogether.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.200
But I don't want you to have this mind suddenly

01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:22.130
shooting out and saying that you didn't ask this question,

01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:25.010
so that you be stressed out. That's why I answer.

01:29:25.130 --> 01:29:27.080
Otherwise makes no difference whether I answer

01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:29.020
or don't answer.

01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:31.170
It's something very different,

01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:34.160
different area.

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.030
So now, we are all prepared for our realization.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.120
Those who got yesterday also will get it more.

01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.230
As I have told you, those who do not want to have it,

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:03.050
I cannot force on you - cannot force.

01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:16.090
I think all the Sahaja yogis from the West have to go out -

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:19.230
this time is there, sorry.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.040
I know you want to sit down for meditation,

01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:26.020
but you'll be getting much more chances than others;

01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:27.240
because there's time up.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.070
You have to pack up your things.

01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:32.060
All right.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.200
Look at them, they're singing Sanskrit,

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.150
and it's complete "Ai Giri Nandini" they sing so well.

01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:42.090
Just think of them - can you imagine, these people,

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.150
how did they learn?

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:47.060
These are Germans, can you imagine?

01:30:47.230 --> 01:30:50.060
They don't call themselves Germans, no.

01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:52.210
How could they do it?

01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:57.180
They didn't know, these English didn't know a word

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:01.020
of Hindi; they lived here for three hundred years,

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:03.070
I don't know what they did.

01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:06.110
Even to tell them Darwaza Band Kar (means close the door)

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:09.000
you had to say, "There was a banker."

01:31:09.170 --> 01:31:11.130
Look at them!

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.050
All this is the Atma!

01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.200
How they appreciate your music,

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:20.050
and how they appreciate your Kuchipudi dancing out,

01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:22.200
it's surprising -

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:26.190
much more than you can.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:40.070
Because our music comes from Aumkara.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.090
It will be proved, Brahman.

01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:49.190
We should be proud that we are Indians.

01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:58.190
Our culture is the highest culture in the whole world.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:02.130
We must respect our culture and preserve it.

01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:06.160
Ask them, they will show you,

01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:11.150
they will tell you what they have found in Sahaja Yoga.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.230
Question about moksha.

01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:22.240
This is moksha only?

01:32:23.070 --> 01:32:24.130
Of course!

01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:27.020
This is what moksha is.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:37.240
"Moksha" means where you rise about your physical,

01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:40.080
mental, emotional being;

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:43.100
you are no more involved into it.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.160
That is the moksha.

01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:50.120
And by this non-involvement,

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:54.150
all your physical, mental, emotional beings are solved.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:03.070
You become that, you become the tattwa ,

01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:06.150
Tattwamasi you become the tattwa.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:09.120
"Aham Brahmasmi"- you become the [*]Brahma.

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:12.100
It's all around - this is Brahma.

01:33:17.130 --> 01:33:19.080
But even when you become you don't believe,

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.070
again I tell you.

01:33:21.170 --> 01:33:23.140
I mean, I don't know what happens,

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:26.000
they don't believe that they are.

01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:33.190
All right,

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:38.070
so a simple thing is now is to understand that

01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:40.140
it's a living process.

01:33:41.010 --> 01:33:45.150
It cannot be forced, it works by itself.

01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:50.210
But you all have fundamental right

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:53.220
to get your Self-realization, all of you -

01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:56.100
whatever race you may be, whatever religion you may be,

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.000
whatever country you may be - you are a human being,

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.170
and you all have this right.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:05.030
I would request you to take out your shoes and

01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:08.090
to put your feet on this Mother Earth,

01:34:15.230 --> 01:34:18.070
because she sucks in our problems.

01:34:19.170 --> 01:34:23.090
Both the...please take out your shoes, chappels,

01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:26.090
take out please.

01:34:28.150 --> 01:34:32.010
Language - he doesn't understand My language, is it?

01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:55.200
Both the feet on the Mother Earth, away from each other.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:08.120
Now, during meditation please don't move out, that's all.

01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:29.140
You'll have to go, I think.

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.090
Please, I think you'd better go.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.030
You are going by plane? ....

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:04.110
All right.

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.120
You are Sahaja yogis, you can do anything.

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.180
The train will wait for you!

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:18.130
They don't want to miss any moment.

01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:21.180
They understand the importance of every moment,

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.160
you can imagine.

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:34.110
What you need is sincerity to yourself.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.000
Now you have to put your both feet away from each other,

01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:48.030
and have a very pleasant feeling about yourself -

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:52.020
prasanna bhave, prasanna chitt.

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.110
Don't be angry with yourself, with anyone,

01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:57.020
just be prasanna.

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.000
What a nice word we have in Sanskrit, prasanna.

01:37:01.130 --> 01:37:04.140
Put both the feet away from each other like this,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.160
and have a very nice feeling about yourself,

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.040
very pleasant feeling.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:20.180
First we'll tell you what chakras are to be touched,

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.150
and how to raise your kundalini yourself.

01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:26.040
But later on you don't have to worry,

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.210
later on, because it's very simple.

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:36.000
He will show you how to raise your own kundalini.

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.170
You have anything...

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:58.210
(Please try to loosen it.)

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.200
Please put the left hand towards Me like this...

01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:25.240
All right.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.140
Left hand towards Me like this.

01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:33.180
That is for absorbing the energy,

01:38:35.010 --> 01:38:38.040
or for expression of your desire,

01:38:38.110 --> 01:38:40.120
because left side is the power of desire

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.150
and the right is the power of action.

01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:53.070
So put your left hand towards Me like this,

01:38:53.150 --> 01:38:56.140
the expression of your desire

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.020
to have your Self-realization.

01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:04.240
Take your right hand on your heart.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:13.000
As I told you, in the heart is reflected the God Almighty,

01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:15.230
as spirit.

01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:22.230
If you become the spirit, you become your own master.

01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:26.130
So now you take down your right hand -

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.130
we are working only on the left-hand side -

01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:37.130
on the left-hand side of your abdomen, on the upper part.

01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:39.170
Press it hard.

01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:44.050
This is the center of your mastery.

01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.050
All right?

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.060
Can you hear Me now?

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.130
So now, if you are the spirit you become your own master.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.230
So you put your right hand on the upper portion of

01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:02.060
your abdomen on the left-hand side,

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:05.090
and this is the center of your mastery.

01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:09.200
Who's making the noise?

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.060
They are able to hear Me?

01:41:14.170 --> 01:41:15.200
No?

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:17.230
No, it's quite loud.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.180
Don't you hear Me?

01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:25.130
All right, thank you.

01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:31.190
Now, take down your hand in the lower portion of your

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.120
abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:44.010
This is the center of pure knowledge.

01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:49.180
That is what works on your nerves,

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.150
on your central nervous system,

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:57.150
is manifested by this center of Swadisthana.

01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:06.080
Again you raise your right hand in

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.200
the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:16.220
on the left-hand side.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.200
Then again you'll have to raise your hand on your heart.

01:42:26.130 --> 01:42:30.030
Then raise your hand

01:42:31.230 --> 01:42:33.120
in the corner of your neck and shoulder,

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.040
and turn your head to your right.

01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:48.120
This is the center you catch when you feel guilty,

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.240
and you develop horrible diseases like spondylitis,

01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:54.010
or maybe angina.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:04.190
So now please put your right hand on top your forehead,

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:10.160
and bend your head.

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.130
Here you have to forgive everyone,

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:21.230
without thinking about whom you have to forgive.

01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:29.050
Take back your right hand on the back side of your head;

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.110
this is the Agnya,

01:43:30.190 --> 01:43:35.060
front Agnya and the back Agnya - if you know, the optic lobe.

01:43:35.150 --> 01:43:38.060
Press it on both the sides.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.230
This is just the center because you feel guilty;

01:43:45.150 --> 01:43:49.180
ask forgiveness from the divine Power, that's all.

01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:53.020
Push back your head.

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.020
Now,

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.080
stretch your hand fully,

01:44:07.170 --> 01:44:10.170
and put the center of your palm on top of the

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.080
fontanel bone area, the taloo,

01:44:14.190 --> 01:44:20.060
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:25.240
Put down your head as far as possible.

01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:30.130
Now press it hard and push back your fingers,

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:38.020
and press it hard and move your scalp,

01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:41.240
slowly seven times clockwise.

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:00.220
Now,

01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:05.000
that's how we have to do it.

01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:09.200
At the very outset there are three conditions.

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:16.230
First is that you all should feel fully confident

01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:20.230
that you are going to get your Self-realization,

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.220
that you are going to get your Self-realization -

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.110
(can you hear Me now?) -

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.160
fully confident.

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.130
Secondly -

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.170
(can you fix it?) -

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:48.060
second condition is that you should not feel guilty

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:51.040
at all about anything.

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:58.010
Us Indians don't feel so much guilty as the Westerners.

01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:03.070
It's good idea not to feel guilty.

01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:09.210
Don't listen to anybody who tells you this is wrong,

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.220
you are like that, you are like that - nothing of the kind.

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:15.220
Nobody has business to judge you.

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.020
So please don't feel guilty, very important.

01:46:24.090 --> 01:46:28.090
And the third condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:33.240
Many of you will say that's difficult, which is wrong.

01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:36.080
As I told you yesterday,

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.100
whether you forgive or don't forgive,

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.140
you don't do anything.

01:46:43.170 --> 01:46:52.030
So why not forgive anyone - only we play into wrong hands.

01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:56.170
So just, without thinking about whom you have to

01:46:57.010 --> 01:47:02.120
forgive or whom you have to remember,

01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:08.040
try just to say in general, "I forgive everyone."

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.200
You'll feel much lighter. Just you say that.

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.190
That's a myth, you are living with a myth.

01:47:18.090 --> 01:47:20.050
Can you hear Me now? You can.

01:47:20.150 --> 01:47:26.050
Can you hear Me, that side? Back side, do you hear Me?

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.120
Now, you have to close your eyes.

01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:45.030
You can take out your spectacles,

01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:47.090
because you should not open your eyes till I tell you.

01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:49.090
Please take out your spectacles.

01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:52.100
If there's anything tight on your neck or in your,

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.040
on your waist, please ...

01:47:57.210 --> 01:48:00.230
If you have anything - What's the matter?

01:48:01.090 --> 01:48:04.050
If you have anything - I have to just go on to it,

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.020
that's what's just coming -

01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:12.000
anything on your neck or on your waist,

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:14.200
something very tight, you can ...

01:48:15.170 --> 01:48:18.140
If you have any tawis or anything, please remove it,

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.160
it's not very good.

01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:24.210
Or some mala given by some guru or someone,

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.020
please remove it;

01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.200
because you have not come here

01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:40.150
to enslave yourself to anyone,

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.200
but to become absolutely free.

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.150
So now we close our eyes, all of us.

01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:54.090
Please close your eyes.

01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:56.240
Put both the feet on the Mother Earth still,

01:48:57.050 --> 01:49:00.240
don't forget that, you have to put both the feet, yes.

01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:06.160
Now, close your eyes fully, don't open them.

01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:10.230
Now, put the left hand towards Me on your lap

01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:16.200
and right hand on your heart, right hand on your heart.

01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:20.000
Now left hand open towards Me, open,

01:49:20.110 --> 01:49:22.110
keep it open towards Me.

01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:26.040
You can keep it in your ....

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:41.050
Now, in the heart resides the spirit.

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:44.100
You ask Me a question three times,

01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:50.080
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:52.200
It's very fundamental question.

01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:55.140
Without any diffidence,

01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:58.230
please ask this question in your heart three times,

01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:02.000
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:50:05.170 --> 01:50:08.130
That's a fact: you are the spirit.

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.040
That's the truth about you.

01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:15.100
Now, take down your right hand in the

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.070
upper portion of your abdomen.

01:50:17.150 --> 01:50:21.160
To be Prassana Chitta...You should not be overly serious.

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.220
There is nothing serious, you see.

01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:26.170
Must understand, you should be prasanna chitta.

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:32.230
Forget your past.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.090
Now, here you have to ask another question three times,

01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:46.040
"Mother, am I my own master?"

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:48.240
Ask this question three times.

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.230
"Am I my own guru?"

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:59.160
This center is created by the Satgurus

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:02.160
for you to establish yourself.

01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:08.110
Now, take down your right hand in the lower portion of

01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:14.140
your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:23.070
I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:28.040
The rest is all avidya; this is vidya.

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:33.020
Vidya, where it is vida, is knowledge.

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:37.010
So you have to ask six times,

01:51:37.130 --> 01:51:42.180
"Mother, please may I have pure knowledge?"

01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:55.230
When you ask for pure knowledge,

01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:59.060
your kundalini starts rising.

01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:03.040
And now we have to nourish

01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:07.040
our upper centers with our self-confidence.

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:14.040
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:18.070
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:52:31.190 --> 01:52:36.000
And here with full confidence you have to say ten times,

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:39.100
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:41.140
Please say it with full confidence.

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:45.060
Don't doubt yourself; you are your master.

01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.120
Please put your left hand towards Me,

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.140
towards Me.

01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:54.150
Many people are not having left hand towards Me.

01:53:06.090 --> 01:53:10.190
I've already told you that the truth about you is that

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:17.160
you are not this body, this mind, these emotions,

01:53:19.170 --> 01:53:21.140
these conditionings,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.090
this ego;

01:53:23.170 --> 01:53:27.050
but you are the pure spirit.

01:53:29.010 --> 01:53:33.220
So please now raise your right hand on your heart,

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:43.120
and here with full confidence you have to say,

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:47.070
"Mother, I am the pure spirit.

01:53:47.190 --> 01:53:51.160
Mother, I am the shuddha Atma."

01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:54.240
Say it with full confidence.

01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:21.010
Now, raise little bit properly, you see,

01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:24.220
it should not be very low also, raise it properly,

01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:28.210
as if raising your heart.

01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:31.080
Raise it.

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.190
This all-pervading Power

01:54:40.190 --> 01:54:46.160
is the power of love,

01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:52.030
is the ocean of knowledge,

01:54:52.170 --> 01:54:56.170
ocean of bliss and compassion.

01:54:57.030 --> 01:55:02.040
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.040
and whatever you think you have done wrong

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:08.160
can be easily dissolved in this great ocean.

01:55:10.130 --> 01:55:14.220
So please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck

01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:17.130
and your shoulder,

01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:20.130
and push it back more.

01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:26.020
Here you have to say sixteen times,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.170
"Mother, I am not guilty."

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.030
Say it sixteen times, please.

01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:39.230
"Mother, I am nirdosh. I'm absolutely nirdosh."

01:55:48.130 --> 01:55:50.120
I have already told you

01:55:50.230 --> 01:55:52.150
that whether you forgive or don't forgive,

01:55:52.210 --> 01:55:56.210
you don't do anything; it's a myth.

01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:03.170
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:12.000
and torture yourself, while the person who has tortured you

01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:14.080
is quite happy.

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:20.150
So now, raise your right hand on your forehead across,

01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:24.010
and put down your head.

01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:29.140
Fully put down your head, and here

01:56:33.150 --> 01:56:37.180
you have to say from your heart, not how many times.

01:56:38.170 --> 01:56:40.060
If you don't say it,

01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:45.180
I cannot make your kundalini pass through this constricted

01:56:46.010 --> 01:56:47.120
Agnya Chakra.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.210
So please, all of you should say,

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:55.050
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general,"

01:56:55.170 --> 01:57:00.130
not thinking about anyone in particular, please.

01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:17.150
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head.

01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:27.050
Push back your head, as far as possible.

01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:31.180
Without feeling guilty,

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.190
without counting your mistakes,

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:43.230
just for your satisfaction you have to say,

01:57:44.110 --> 01:57:46.110
"Oh divine Power,

01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:50.120
please forgive me if I have done anything wrong.

01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:57.070
Oh Brahmachaitanya, please forgive me if I have done

01:57:57.150 --> 01:58:00.020
anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly."

01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:06.210
This you have to say in your heart,

01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:09.240
not how many times.

01:58:17.150 --> 01:58:19.160
Now,

01:58:24.110 --> 01:58:28.080
stretch your right hand.

01:58:30.110 --> 01:58:35.140
Put the center of your palm of right hand

01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:39.150
on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.030
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:49.040
Push back your fingers as far as possible.

01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:54.070
Put down your head as far as possible.

01:58:56.050 --> 01:58:58.050
Here again,

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:04.130
I cannot force Self-realization on you,

01:59:05.210 --> 01:59:08.030
so you have to ask for it.

01:59:09.170 --> 01:59:13.220
Move your scalp seven times clockwise,

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:19.150
saying, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

01:59:20.010 --> 01:59:22.070
Seven times, please.

01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:26.140
Don't move the hand so much as the scalp.

01:59:26.210 --> 01:59:28.230
Please press it hard. Push back your fingers.

01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:30.210
First is, unless until you push back fingers,

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.070
there won't be any pressure.

02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.220
Now take down your hands, please.

02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:37.140
Put both the hands towards Me.

02:00:39.170 --> 02:00:42.140
Now watch Me without thinking.

02:00:50.130 --> 02:00:52.240
Now put your right hand towards Me,

02:00:53.090 --> 02:00:55.240
and bend your head and see for yourself.

02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:57.190
Don't watch others, watch yourself.

02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:01.030
See if there's a cool breeze coming out of your

02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:02.220
fontanel bone area,

02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:06.160
see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your

02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:08.080
fontanel bone area.

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.220
There might be a hot breeze also;

02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:15.090
if you have not forgiven, specially,

02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:17.180
then the hot breeze might be there.

02:01:18.150 --> 02:01:21.000
So now you forgive.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.200
Now, take your left hand towards Me like this.

02:01:27.070 --> 02:01:29.070
Again put down your head.

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.240
Not on top, but away from it;

02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:34.020
some people get it very far also.

02:01:34.130 --> 02:01:37.110
Try to see if there's a cool breeze

02:01:37.190 --> 02:01:41.100
or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:45.200
On the fontanel, not very far backward and forward,

02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:49.120
but on the fontanel, on the taloo.

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.000
All right?

02:01:56.110 --> 02:01:59.230
Again, put your right hand towards Me.

02:02:00.130 --> 02:02:04.100
Ha! Bend your head, bend your head.

02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:09.130
That's it!

02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:12.040
Now,

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.070
I have to tell you how to give yourself the Kavach

02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:17.220
to protect yourself,

02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:19.190
it's very important;

02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:22.030
and how to raise your kundalini,

02:02:22.110 --> 02:02:25.230
it's very important, very simple - he'll show you also.

02:02:26.190 --> 02:02:29.140
Put your left hand like this in front of you,

02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:31.140
and the right hand you have to move,

02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:33.190
the left hand goes straight.

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:37.000
So you have to - I'll just show you first of all, like this.

02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:43.110
It goes up onto your head, and here you give it one knot.

02:02:45.010 --> 02:02:47.110
Now, again we'll start now, properly.

02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:50.030
We start it from here.

02:02:50.090 --> 02:02:53.130
Now start moving your left hand upward.

02:02:54.090 --> 02:02:56.230
For fixing up your kundalini,

02:02:57.070 --> 02:03:00.230
put your hand up and give it one knot;

02:03:02.190 --> 02:03:05.010
then again, the second one.

02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:11.230
Give it the second knot.

02:03:12.090 --> 02:03:14.100
Third knot you have to give three times.

02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:16.240
Now again do it, please:

02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:26.210
one, it's two,

02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:32.210
and three. Done! Now the Kavach.

02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:36.130
You have to take for your protection every morning

02:03:36.210 --> 02:03:40.050
when you go out, and before sleeping you should

02:03:40.110 --> 02:03:42.060
put your attention here and sleep off.

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:45.080
Put the left hand towards Me like this.

02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:51.070
It is Saadhe teen...

02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:55.230
the three-and-a half coils.

02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.100
So how do you give Kavach?

02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:02.010
It's, put left hand towards Me, towards the photograph,

02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:04.120
put the right hand like this -

02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:06.090
I'll show you first of all.

02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:11.110
Then raise it like this, bring it down - this is half.

02:04:12.170 --> 02:04:17.040
Then again you take it back - this is one.

02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:25.040
Again you take it up, is again you take it back - is two.

02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:30.020
Again you take it like this,

02:04:31.190 --> 02:04:34.020
again you bring it back - is three.

02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:36.100
And now you take it back only halfway,

02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:39.010
so three-and-a-half times.

02:04:42.110 --> 02:04:45.160
This is bandhan, is the Kavach,

02:04:46.090 --> 02:04:49.010
Kavach of protection.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.180
Also lots of things you'll learn,

02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:55.120
how to use this power from your hand.

02:04:55.190 --> 02:04:57.220
Now, all those who have felt

02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:01.170
cool or hot breeze in their hands

02:05:02.010 --> 02:05:05.040
or out of your fontanel bone area,

02:05:06.070 --> 02:05:08.030
please raise your both hands.

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:12.010
All those who have felt, please raise both your hands.

02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:17.210
They have a little problem of liver, but it will work out,

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:20.100
it doesn't matter.

02:05:21.170 --> 02:05:23.090
May God bless you all,

02:05:23.170 --> 02:05:25.200
may God bless you.

02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.180
So Madras should become now Mada Raas,

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:39.180
means all the Mada (vanity) is finished

02:05:42.110 --> 02:05:44.240
and achieve that state.

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:49.040
May God bless you all. Again and again I tell you,

02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:54.070
be humble and come to the center.

02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:57.190
There are some very good Sahaja yogis in the center.

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:02.110
They'll all tell you everything with very loving way.

02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:07.190
But please come, and pay attention to yourself,

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:12.000
and know everything.

02:06:12.110 --> 02:06:15.210
Next year I will come again to Madras.

02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:19.170
May God bless you.
