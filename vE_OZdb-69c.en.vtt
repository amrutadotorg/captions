WEBVTT

03:28.340 --> 03:47.157
So we are all here now (UNCLEAR) in this sacred
place called Kolhapur.

03:47.182 --> 04:01.489
The Goddess killed the asura called Kolhasura
here, who was a very bad demon, who was born

04:01.514 --> 04:06.743
again recently, but he died also.

04:06.768 --> 04:11.870
So thank God the death of Kolhasura has taken
place.

04:11.870 --> 04:34.993
This place specially is marked because from
the Mother Earth the Mahalakshmi energy was

04:35.018 --> 04:39.168
emitted specially from the deity of Mahalakshmi.

04:41.796 --> 04:50.563
And as you know that Mahalakshmi is the ascending
power within us.

04:50.588 --> 04:53.420
Through which we ascend.

04:53.523 --> 05:04.416
It’s like the staircase which takes you
into the realm of God and so it is very important.

05:04.702 --> 05:14.391
And Maharastra’s deity is Vittala, Shri
Krishna, because it is the ascending power

05:14.391 --> 05:27.081
of Vishnu through Shri Krishna, then Mahavishnu
and then through Sahastrar.

05:27.081 --> 05:33.571
All this is possible because we have got Mahalakshmi
channel within us.

05:33.571 --> 05:43.891
If you did not have shushumna we would have
been like animals only.

05:43.891 --> 05:52.331
Even animals have this channel up to a point.

05:52.403 --> 06:02.320
As you know they come up to the Void, but
after the Void the ascent as human being starts

06:02.345 --> 06:06.839
through this Mahalakshmi energy within us.

06:07.147 --> 06:19.256
So this energy is very important and that
one is very much worshipped in this country.

06:19.290 --> 06:29.965
First this energy starts working within us
as seeking.

06:29.965 --> 06:36.773
Seeking shelter and food.

06:37.313 --> 06:46.786
Once the shelter is established, which is
established through the Mahakali shakti, I

06:46.810 --> 06:55.300
mean when it is in the heart of an animal
a sense of security is established.

06:55.411 --> 06:58.899
Then he starts seeking food.

06:58.899 --> 07:10.559
In the same way human beings also, once he
is established in his security, then he starts

07:10.559 --> 07:15.548
thinking of feeding himself, looking after
himself.

07:15.548 --> 07:23.869
So at the very primitive state the human beings
first tried to establish their security by

07:23.869 --> 07:32.909
getting into some caves or some shelters where
they could abide without fear to life, because

07:32.909 --> 07:36.939
if there is no life you don’t think of food.

07:36.939 --> 07:41.858
For example if there is an emergency, we had
a very bad floods in Patna and it was such

07:41.858 --> 07:54.328
a bad flood that people had to go in the upper
storey and look after their security, that

07:54.353 --> 07:56.052
was the first thing.

07:57.021 --> 08:07.428
Which is such an innate feeling in human beings
to preserve life and that comes from the Mahakali’s

08:07.428 --> 08:09.052
powers.

08:09.077 --> 08:14.501
And when they went up there, they told me
that they didn’t have food for three days

08:14.526 --> 08:16.446
but they had never thought of food.

08:16.622 --> 08:21.133
They never even thought they were hungry,
they were only worried that the water will

08:21.158 --> 08:24.849
rise up to that point where they are and they’ll
all sink and die.

08:24.849 --> 08:29.208
So the only worry was that how to exist, how
to survive.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.399
I mean the food question did not come.

08:31.399 --> 08:39.479
But when people starve they also start thinking
of insecurity that they may die and they start

08:39.479 --> 08:42.499
thinking about food.

08:42.499 --> 08:50.818
So the first security comes in, then the second
comes: the sense of food.

08:50.818 --> 08:57.759
In emergency the sense of food that comes
is the beginning, but later on we start putting

08:57.759 --> 08:59.927
our attention to food.

09:00.078 --> 09:03.719
Then the enjoyment of the food.

09:03.719 --> 09:08.359
Then discrimination of the food and all those
things you see various things they start coming

09:08.359 --> 09:13.174
into us and we get lost with this Mahalakshmi
tattwa.

09:13.199 --> 09:22.339
The more we worry about the food, the more
we worry about the taste of the food, the

09:22.339 --> 09:28.509
more we worry about the time of the food,
I mean one can live without food for two three

09:28.509 --> 09:31.485
days very easily, there’s no problem.

09:31.510 --> 09:34.595
But we think that we are used to breakfast
at eight o’clock, we must have breakfast

09:34.620 --> 09:36.158
at eight o’clock.

09:36.922 --> 09:42.077
Like Indians are used to their lunch at ten
o’clock, they must have lunch at ten o’clock.

09:42.102 --> 09:48.839
This is all our slavery to time, and that’s
how our seeking which is higher, finishes

09:48.839 --> 09:49.839
off.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.052
Then they’ll start talking about food all
the time.

09:53.077 --> 09:58.739
This is of course Mahakshmi’s blessings
that you think of food, but she doesn’t

09:58.739 --> 10:01.059
say you get lost in it.

10:01.059 --> 10:05.387
So we get lost with it and once we are lost
with it, then our seeking doesn’t become

10:05.412 --> 10:07.011
higher.

10:12.205 --> 10:20.149
Our taste habits; we like this, we like that,
this is good, that is bad, we’d like to

10:20.149 --> 10:25.454
have this; still if it lingers it keeps us
down.

10:25.479 --> 10:28.493
Whatever we get we should try to eat.

10:28.518 --> 10:37.323
Whatever we think good, may not be good for
us.

10:37.348 --> 10:41.613
It may be good for the tongue, but may not
be good for us, may not be good from vibrations

10:41.638 --> 10:42.767
point of view.

10:42.792 --> 10:47.232
So whatever God gives us, whatever is there,
is good.

10:47.257 --> 10:49.738
Vibrate it and eat it.

10:50.242 --> 10:56.771
Also then the preservation sense comes in
that if you eat wrong type of food, then people

10:56.938 --> 11:02.599
start thinking, that this will also ruin their
security, because they may lose their health.

11:02.599 --> 11:09.009
Then they start thinking about, up to a point
is all right, but if you do too much, then

11:09.009 --> 11:11.659
you get out of the circulation.

11:11.659 --> 11:16.493
In the sense that if you are flying through…

11:16.518 --> 11:20.181
Will you please pay attention here, I’m
surprised that you are

11:20.334 --> 11:23.878
sahaja yogis, how is it your attention goes
to small things like that?

11:30.391 --> 11:33.785
There’s some ladies still looking at that
side.

11:36.883 --> 11:41.476
(UNCLEAR) Please try to put your attention
to what I’m saying.

11:43.945 --> 11:47.358
Is it important that brother bringing something,
must you see that?

11:48.557 --> 11:52.099
I mean this is really silly at this age.

11:52.124 --> 12:00.064
Now you are sahaja yogis, your attention should
be concentrated.

12:05.574 --> 12:16.099
So now the attention more goes towards the
acquisition of better facilities for food

12:16.099 --> 12:21.189
or better food, whatever you may call for
‘health food’ as you call it and that

12:21.189 --> 12:28.165
also if you go too much, you can touch the
banks, but you shouldn’t cross over and

12:28.190 --> 12:32.358
walk through, otherwise how will you move
on the river, that’s the point is.

12:32.358 --> 12:36.079
So we start building up that sort of a nonsense
also; this is good for health, this is not

12:36.079 --> 12:39.665
good for health, that is good for health…and
health for what?

12:40.078 --> 12:42.165
For what is the health?

12:42.522 --> 12:47.536
Health is for having a good attention, which
you don’t have, is lost in the food.

12:47.561 --> 12:53.478
And some people I’ve seen, they are just
still lost in food, completely.

12:53.478 --> 13:01.831
Though they have got a glimpse of sahaja yoga,
but still they are very much attached to food.

13:01.856 --> 13:10.248
So that sort of an attitude must be changed,
we should see where we go and get ourselves

13:10.248 --> 13:13.988
attached and lose our attention.

13:13.988 --> 13:20.469
This is very important that we should be very
careful about our attention, where is it?

13:20.469 --> 13:25.378
So now the attention moves on with that, I
mean those who still move further and don’t

13:25.378 --> 13:30.829
jump on the banks, still move in the river,
further on.

13:30.829 --> 13:36.549
Attention goes on, then they think that you
see this kind, it works all the time the insecurity

13:36.549 --> 13:37.818
part of it in it.

13:37.818 --> 13:44.188
So that this food will be lost, so what should
we do to have better food.

13:44.188 --> 13:47.798
So they start thinking of money.

13:47.798 --> 13:51.789
So you know that the barter system became
a system of money.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.988
People started having money.

13:53.988 --> 14:01.829
But then apart from food, clothing, other
things started and people started moving with

14:01.829 --> 14:05.649
it to the Mahakali power more and more.

14:05.649 --> 14:08.875
And the creative power more and more.

14:08.900 --> 14:13.098
The banks are also becoming subtler and subtler,
the movement is also becoming subtler and

14:13.123 --> 14:14.123
subtler.

14:14.236 --> 14:22.659
So as the man started moving higher and higher,
arts developed on the right side and the idea

14:22.659 --> 14:26.793
of quality of life or quality of security
changed.

14:26.880 --> 14:34.969
So the both the sides becoming subtler and
subtler and the growth becoming subtler and

14:34.969 --> 14:40.817
subtler, man gets again lost into those subtler
banks, on the right and the left.

14:40.849 --> 14:43.226
Still you have to move further.

14:43.251 --> 14:46.468
So the Mahalakshmi power takes you higher
and higher.

14:46.493 --> 14:50.488
That time then you think you must express
yourself.

14:50.488 --> 14:53.909
And the expression starts in arts, culture.

14:53.909 --> 15:02.818
It starts also in your living, in your institutions
of security, like political advancement, political

15:02.818 --> 15:10.748
institutions and that’s how human being
reached a point where now they think they

15:10.748 --> 15:19.664
have done that was all possible, but still
in a subtler way they are still lost.

15:19.689 --> 15:27.254
So the Mahalakshmi tattwa went up to say Christ,
up to that point and still people have not

15:27.279 --> 15:30.436
gone into the subtler side of that.

15:30.745 --> 15:39.209
They are still on the banks, moving towards
the banks, not in the centre of it.

15:39.209 --> 15:50.139
In sahaja yoga, what happens is that the pure
desire, that is kundalini is kept at the beginning

15:50.164 --> 15:55.209
of the life, just at the beginning of the
life.

15:55.234 --> 15:59.639
When you were not even a human being.

15:59.639 --> 16:12.329
Even below is carbon and all the journey from
carbon onwards is to be recrossed again through

16:12.329 --> 16:15.571
the kundalini.

16:15.729 --> 16:26.509
All this journey that you did on the superficial
level of this Mahalakshmi stream has to be

16:26.509 --> 16:38.279
redone in the innermost way, to penetrate
through all these subtler centres, which are

16:38.279 --> 16:42.153
inside the stream, not outside.

16:42.264 --> 16:46.439
Because if you are on the outside, you always
go to the banks.

16:46.464 --> 16:51.388
From where you cannot see any banks, there
is no attention that could be taken to the

16:51.413 --> 16:54.819
banks, but you move further.

16:54.844 --> 16:57.674
Like a jet.

16:57.812 --> 17:08.740
And this kundalini is the one that’s the
true desire, but your attention has to be

17:08.765 --> 17:10.518
on the target.

17:10.543 --> 17:17.779
Even if you say that the kundalini is the
moving force, still where is your attention?

17:17.779 --> 17:23.949
Still your attention is on the banks, so you
come up again superficially, you come and

17:23.949 --> 17:28.639
just float superficially and then again jump
onto some bank and then again I’ll have

17:28.639 --> 17:32.123
to put you down inside the water: ‘Go inside,
inside.

17:32.148 --> 17:35.711
’ Again go back to the kundalini, again
start your journey.

17:36.013 --> 17:46.229
But from the very beginning steadfast if you
move towards the target, towards the spirit,

17:46.229 --> 17:47.948
then I have no problem.

17:47.948 --> 17:53.289
But it doesn’t happen with human beings,
they are so much used to the attraction of

17:53.289 --> 18:00.429
the banks that they always come up, float,
go to the banks and again sometimes settle

18:00.429 --> 18:02.448
down there or again come back.

18:02.448 --> 18:07.068
So the journey is upward, downward, downward,
upward.

18:07.068 --> 18:09.640
Though the movement of the kundalini could

18:09.665 --> 18:12.910
be such that you jump like a jet and set down there.

18:13.437 --> 18:18.239
The day that starts I’ll be the happiest
person because it is too much sometimes for

18:18.239 --> 18:26.899
me, to make this kind of a journey four times
up and down with everyone, because of the

18:26.899 --> 18:29.999
so called attachments they have outside.

18:29.999 --> 18:37.859
The inner movement with a detached mind, if
they accept the situation and they decide

18:37.859 --> 18:40.135
within themselves that I’m going to do like
this,

18:40.160 --> 18:42.857
I’ve decided on this, they can work it out.

18:42.882 --> 18:44.141
But it’s not so.

18:44.479 --> 18:49.560
Mostly the attitude should be that Mother
is like a mirror.

18:49.918 --> 18:53.857
And we have a mirror in front of us, so we
know how we are proceeding.

18:53.960 --> 18:58.864
So in the mirror if I see myself like this,
better get rid of it and go on.

18:58.967 --> 19:04.023
But on the contrary if Mother says something
to someone, that this is so,

19:04.047 --> 19:07.361
then they feel hurt and again float up.

19:07.415 --> 19:09.425
The mirror has to say something.

19:09.450 --> 19:13.841
Supposing you have some spot on your face,
the mirror is not going to please you, it

19:13.841 --> 19:15.407
will say it is there.

19:15.432 --> 19:19.980
So you don’t hit the mirror and you just
don’t get angry with the mirror, do you?

19:20.005 --> 19:24.073
You see that you clear yourself because you
don’t want to have any spots.

19:24.098 --> 19:25.983
But just the other way round.

19:26.008 --> 19:30.504
What happens with people I have seen, that
if you tell them anything or you just tell

19:30.529 --> 19:36.774
them this is wrong, they’ll first explain,
argue, this thing and if it doesn’t work

19:36.799 --> 19:40.341
out then they will just get angry with sahaja
yoga and you.

19:40.341 --> 19:45.525
As if they are obliging sahaja yoga, as if
they are obliging Mother.

19:45.550 --> 19:48.470
Actually you are obliging yourself.

19:49.821 --> 19:55.449
You are not obliging anyone or if you take
up that kind of an attitude, then only you

19:55.474 --> 20:00.752
will realize that you have to move forward
without looking left or right.

20:00.784 --> 20:06.455
So we have had many experiences, quite funny
if you look back you can see that you have

20:06.575 --> 20:13.325
been sometimes Romeo Juliets, sometimes you
have been money minded people, sometimes you

20:13.350 --> 20:16.592
have been quarrelling, fighting, arguing type.

20:16.617 --> 20:18.479
All kinds we have had.

20:18.504 --> 20:26.919
But those who forget all this and shoot off
towards the goal

20:26.944 --> 20:30.007
are the best and the most   sensible.

20:30.335 --> 20:34.849
They are the most selfish people, because
they know what selfishness is, all the rest

20:34.874 --> 20:38.165
are stupid because they are losing their time.

20:38.190 --> 20:43.750
There are some people I’ve seen who also
try to use sahaja yoga for making money or

20:43.775 --> 20:48.713
making something for sahaj yog sort of thing

20:48.738 --> 20:51.801
and making some money out of it or sort of a thing.

20:51.826 --> 21:01.090
You better make yourself is the best way and
enjoy it in a way that makes you happy and

21:01.115 --> 21:04.922
makes others happy in the sahaja stream.

21:04.947 --> 21:10.574
But getting out of the sahaja stream and doing
something is again coming out of that innermost

21:10.574 --> 21:17.697
channel of Bramha nadi, outward, again floating,
going to the banks, again going down, because

21:17.722 --> 21:22.347
every time you go down like that you have
to start your kundalini again back.

21:22.862 --> 21:24.808
It’s a very difficult thing.

21:24.840 --> 21:28.369
And the force of the kundalini gets spent.

21:28.424 --> 21:33.504
So one has to understand that if you have
to do this journey,

21:33.529 --> 21:36.369
you have to be a determined person.

21:36.394 --> 21:39.263
You have to be a disciplined person, yourself.

21:39.288 --> 21:43.058
Nobody should tell you that discipline yourself,
do this do that.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.003
You have to do it.

21:44.028 --> 21:48.549
What others are doing, first is the attention
is there, I mean if somebody brings it here,

21:48.595 --> 21:50.120
everybody’s attention must go there.

21:50.145 --> 21:52.095
What is there to see?

21:55.830 --> 22:01.663
But this is nothing, this is very, very superfluous
thing, but even serious things should not

22:01.688 --> 22:03.545
attract your attention.

22:03.570 --> 22:10.939
Your attention should be on the solution of
all the solutions.

22:10.964 --> 22:18.799
Blessing of all the blessings.

22:18.831 --> 22:22.291
The emancipation of all the emancipations.

22:23.498 --> 22:29.035
You shouldn’t worry about anything else,
you just worry about that connection, which

22:29.060 --> 22:31.548
is being established and nothing else.

22:31.573 --> 22:33.905
Everything is looked after.

22:34.446 --> 22:37.328
It is as simple as that.

22:37.427 --> 22:42.213
If this connection is broken the simple thing
is to keep the connection on.

22:42.301 --> 22:45.382
What’s the use of polishing this, doing
this, doing that?

22:45.407 --> 22:48.707
Are you going to get the connection back?

22:48.732 --> 22:55.182
This is a simple, practical thing we find.

22:56.169 --> 23:04.011
And once we start forgetting that practical
side, we become retarded in our progress.

23:04.114 --> 23:07.321
And what we find, wherever we are, we are
there.

23:07.354 --> 23:11.052
Like in this Kolapur I would say, when I come
you’ll see tonight, there will be a huge

23:11.077 --> 23:13.364
crowd, very huge crowd.

23:13.364 --> 23:14.736
Always we have.

23:15.649 --> 23:19.118
Out of them how many really take up this journey?

23:19.143 --> 23:20.143
Very few.

23:22.973 --> 23:23.973
Doesn’t matter.

23:23.973 --> 23:25.309
You shouldn’t mind it.

23:25.334 --> 23:27.834
Because they are not wise yet.

23:28.025 --> 23:34.063
But those who become wise, who take up the
journey, also in between ‘jack in the box’

23:34.094 --> 23:35.354
they come out.

23:36.116 --> 23:38.667
Suddenly I find somebody floating.

23:38.779 --> 23:40.865
We are going through the submarine.

23:40.890 --> 23:43.638
And they just jet out.

23:44.599 --> 23:47.610
This is how it has happened with all our journey.

23:47.635 --> 23:56.337
And at this place when we are, we have arrived
here not by plane, not by car, not by roads,

23:56.736 --> 24:03.024
but through the innermost core of our heart,
you have arrived, the bramha nadi.

24:03.049 --> 24:10.097
We have arrived at Kolapur at Mahalakshmi’s
point, through the most innermost part and

24:10.122 --> 24:12.650
that’s how we are here.

24:12.675 --> 24:16.901
So we look at this place in a very gross manner.

24:16.926 --> 24:20.930
That’s our old habits.

24:20.955 --> 24:25.667
But the new habit should be vibration wise,
where are we?

24:25.692 --> 24:26.769
What is it?

24:26.794 --> 24:33.574
Once you develop this, we I can definitely
completely transform this Kolapur in (UNCLEAR)

24:33.599 --> 24:36.421
You are like my channels.

24:36.446 --> 24:41.673
When you go with me, I use you as my channels.

24:41.698 --> 24:46.511
But what I find is that the channels are sometimes
crooked, sometimes broken, sometimes there

24:46.536 --> 24:50.047
are holes and the energy is wasted.

24:50.047 --> 24:54.297
So it is the duty of all the sahaja yogis
who are travelling with me specially, is to

24:54.297 --> 24:57.267
be the channels.

24:57.267 --> 25:03.237
But if you take an attitude that you are here
as guests, you have to be looked after, the

25:03.237 --> 25:09.255
arrangement should be good, that should be
good, then you have, there is no meaning.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.810
You are travelling.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.328
You are travelling like saints who travel
with Buddha.

25:15.353 --> 25:17.881
Even much more, because they did not do anything.

25:17.906 --> 25:19.628
But you are the channels.

25:19.676 --> 25:25.062
As you are the channels, you have to keep
your channels open, efficient and you should

25:25.087 --> 25:27.156
work it out.

25:27.156 --> 25:36.927
Today is a special day for all of you, is
called as mahabij, the day of mahabij, means

25:36.927 --> 25:42.404
all the mantra’s have a bija and mahabija
of that is Omkara himself.

25:42.429 --> 25:43.886
Omkar.

25:43.911 --> 25:51.710
And it’s the first place, this Omkara was
like an egg, Bramhand, they call it Bramhand.

25:51.805 --> 25:55.757
The whole Bramha becomes a anda (egg).

25:55.757 --> 25:58.267
Because when they say Bramhand even Sanskrit

25:58.292 --> 26:00.538
people don’t know that they are talking of an egg.

26:00.563 --> 26:01.717
Bramhanda.

26:02.023 --> 26:03.693
The anda of Bramha.

26:03.718 --> 26:05.207
That is the first bij.

26:05.639 --> 26:10.117
And how this Bramha, this vibrations, how
they were created.

26:10.117 --> 26:19.837
In the first place, when the Devi separated
from Shiva, before that she had gone around

26:19.837 --> 26:23.166
him as you know.

26:23.166 --> 26:30.567
And then Shiva told her, Sadashiva told her
that you have to now create.

26:30.567 --> 26:33.907
And the separation took place.

26:33.907 --> 26:46.407
So he came out of that pradakshina or you
can call it elliptical form and when he came

26:46.407 --> 26:54.529
out of it that created a kind of a sound.

26:54.554 --> 27:02.830
A sound that had this Bramha in it.

27:02.973 --> 27:08.742
So that Bramha was left in that area.

27:09.346 --> 27:18.587
As I have told you that first the Devi went
round Sadashiva and created a garland.

27:18.587 --> 27:25.614
That garland had covered Shiva in it.

27:25.639 --> 27:27.508
Like the nucleus inside.

27:28.320 --> 27:33.391
But when Sadashiva went out of it created
a sound.

27:33.589 --> 27:47.587
And that sound filled the whole of that andakruti,
means the form of an egg and that is the mahabiija.

27:47.587 --> 27:51.056
That is the Omkara.

27:51.731 --> 28:06.531
And that is reborn as Shri Ganesh and later
on as Jesus Christ.

28:07.366 --> 28:11.828
That’s why at Mahalakshmi’s place you

28:11.853 --> 28:16.122
come with mahabija day, is a very significant thing.

28:16.710 --> 28:26.588
Because Mahalakshmi was the mother of Jesus,
Mary and her son was the incarnation of mahabija.

28:26.645 --> 28:32.793
So to come here on such and such day, and
to do Mahalakshmi’s Puja, is a very big

28:32.818 --> 28:36.322
privilege, is a great privilege for all of
you.

28:36.536 --> 28:48.894
And with that privilege you should humbly
do this puja and try to get into that mahabija,

28:49.116 --> 28:54.914
become one part of that mahabija, which is
this Bramhand.

28:54.939 --> 28:57.988
The whole Branhand, Bramha’s anda.

28:57.988 --> 29:09.797
Anda means egg is created, be part and parcel
of that and not to create any angularity or

29:09.822 --> 29:16.813
any kind of a misrepresentation but be homogeneous
with the whole Bramha.

29:16.838 --> 29:25.287
One has to put attention to your Bramha Shakti
which is manifested as vibrations.

29:25.287 --> 29:31.060
Today the vibrations are so great, that I
didn’t think I would be able to speak on

29:31.085 --> 29:32.909
this, but somehow I have managed.

29:32.934 --> 29:37.393
I hope you all have been able to understand
the subtlest of subtle

29:37.418 --> 29:39.297
that I have talked to you today.

29:39.297 --> 29:44.258
So when you travel with me you should not
think you have come here to see the whole

29:44.258 --> 29:45.492
land and all that.

29:45.508 --> 29:46.754
Or to enjoy life.

29:46.911 --> 29:53.005
You have come here to become the channel of
your Mother’s work.

29:53.030 --> 29:59.151
If you understand that, then you will be able
to realize that God has given you a

29:59.176 --> 30:01.267
very appointed place.

30:01.648 --> 30:05.401
So I would request you, be deserving.

30:05.426 --> 30:06.764
Deserve it.

30:06.789 --> 30:13.160
Assume your seats, coveted places where God
has put you.

30:13.185 --> 30:16.170
May God Bless You.
