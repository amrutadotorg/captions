00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:48.095
So we are all here now (UNCLEAR) in this sacred
place called Kolhapur.

00:03:48.122 --> 00:04:02.429
The Goddess killed the asura called Kolhasura
here, who was a very bad demon, who was born

00:04:02.454 --> 00:04:07.683
again recently, but he died also.

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:12.810
So thank God the death of Kolhasura has taken
place.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:35.933
This place specially is marked because from
the Mother Earth the Mahalakshmi energy was

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:40.108
emitted specially from the deity of Mahalakshmi.

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:51.503
And as you know that Mahalakshmi is the ascending
power within us.

00:04:51.528 --> 00:04:54.360
Through which we ascend.

00:04:54.463 --> 00:05:05.356
It’s like the staircase which takes you
into the realm of God and so it is very important.

00:05:05.642 --> 00:05:15.331
And Maharastra’s deity is Vittala, Shri
Krishna, because it is the ascending power

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:28.021
of Vishnu through Shri Krishna, then Mahavishnu
and then through Sahastrar.

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:34.511
All this is possible because we have got Mahalakshmi
channel within us.

00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:44.831
If you did not have shushumna we would have
been like animals only.

00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:53.271
Even animals have this channel up to a point.

00:05:53.343 --> 00:06:03.260
As you know they come up to the Void, but
after the Void the ascent as human being starts

00:06:03.285 --> 00:06:07.779
through this Mahalakshmi energy within us.

00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:20.196
So this energy is very important and that
one is very much worshipped in this country.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:30.905
First this energy starts working within us
as seeking.

00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:37.713
Seeking shelter and food.

00:06:38.253 --> 00:06:47.726
Once the shelter is established, which is
established through the Mahakali shakti, I

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:56.240
mean when it is in the heart of an animal
a sense of security is established.

00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:59.839
Then he starts seeking food.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:11.499
In the same way human beings also, once he
is established in his security, then he starts

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:16.488
thinking of feeding himself, looking after
himself.

00:07:16.488 --> 00:07:24.809
So at the very primitive state the human beings
first tried to establish their security by

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:33.849
getting into some caves or some shelters where
they could abide without fear to life, because

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.879
if there is no life you don’t think of food.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.798
For example if there is an emergency, we had
a very bad floods in Patna and it was such

00:07:42.798 --> 00:07:55.268
a bad flood that people had to go in the upper
storey and look after their security, that

00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:56.992
was the first thing.

00:07:57.961 --> 00:08:08.368
Which is such an innate feeling in human beings
to preserve life and that comes from the Mahakali’s

00:08:08.368 --> 00:08:09.992
powers.

00:08:10.017 --> 00:08:15.441
And when they went up there, they told me
that they didn’t have food for three days

00:08:15.466 --> 00:08:17.386
but they had never thought of food.

00:08:17.562 --> 00:08:22.073
They never even thought they were hungry,
they were only worried that the water may

00:08:22.098 --> 00:08:25.789
rise up to that point where they are and they’ll
all sink and die.

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:30.148
So the only worry was that how to exist, how
to survive.

00:08:30.148 --> 00:08:32.339
I mean the food question did not come.

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:40.419
But when people starve they also start thinking
of insecurity that they may die and then they start

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.439
thinking about food.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:51.758
So the first security comes in, then the second
comes: the sense of food.

00:08:51.758 --> 00:08:58.699
In emergency the sense of food that comes
is the beginning, but later on we start putting

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:00.867
our attention to food.

00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:04.659
Then the enjoyment of the food.

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:09.299
Then discrimination of the food and all those
things, you see, various things they start coming

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:14.114
into us and we get lost with this Mahalakshmi
tattwa.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:23.279
The more we worry about the food, the more
we worry about the taste of the food, the

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:29.449
more we worry about the time of the food,
I mean one can live without food for two three

00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:32.425
days very easily, there’s no problem.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.535
But we think that we are used to breakfast
at eight o’clock, we must have breakfast

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.098
at eight o’clock.

00:09:37.862 --> 00:09:43.017
Like Indians are used to their lunch at ten
o’clock, they must have lunch at ten o’clock.

00:09:43.042 --> 00:09:49.779
This is all our slavery to time, and that’s
how our seeking which is higher, finishes

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:50.779
off.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:53.992
Then they’ll start talking about food all
the time.

00:09:54.017 --> 00:09:59.679
This is of course Mahakshmi’s blessings
that we think of food, but She doesn’t

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.999
say that you get lost with it.

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:06.327
So we get lost with it and once we are lost
with it, then our seeking doesn’t become

00:10:06.352 --> 00:10:07.951
higher.

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:21.089
Our taste habits; we like this, we like that,
this is good, that is bad, we’d like to

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:26.394
have this; still if it lingers it keeps us
down.

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:29.433
Whatever we get we should try to eat.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:38.263
Whatever we think good, may not be good for
us.

00:10:38.288 --> 00:10:42.553
It may be good for the tongue, but may not
be good for us, may not be good from vibrations

00:10:42.578 --> 00:10:43.707
point of view.

00:10:43.732 --> 00:10:48.172
So whatever God gives us, whatever is there,
is good.

00:10:48.197 --> 00:10:50.678
Vibrate it and eat it.

00:10:51.182 --> 00:10:57.711
Also then the preservation sense comes in
that if you eat wrong type of food, then people

00:10:57.878 --> 00:11:03.539
start thinking, that this will also ruin their
security, because they may lose their health.

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:09.949
Then they start thinking about it. Up to a point
is all right, but if you do too much, then

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:12.599
you get out of the circulation.

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:17.433
In the sense that if you are flying through…

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:21.121
Will you please pay attention here? I’m
surprised that you are

00:11:21.274 --> 00:11:24.818
sahaja yogis, how is it your attention goes
to small things like that?

00:11:31.331 --> 00:11:34.725
There’s some ladies still looking at that
side.

00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:42.416
(UNCLEAR) Please try to put your attention
to what I’m saying.

00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:48.298
Is it important that brother bringing something,
must you see that?

00:11:49.497 --> 00:11:53.039
I mean this is really silly at this age.

00:11:53.064 --> 00:12:01.004
Now you are sahaja yogis, your attention should
be concentrated.

00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:17.039
So now the attention more goes towards the
acquisition of better facilities for food

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:22.129
or better food, whatever you may call for
‘health food’ as you call it and that

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:29.105
also if you go too much, you can touch the
banks, but you shouldn’t cross over and

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.298
walk through, otherwise how will you move
on the river, that’s the point is.

00:12:33.298 --> 00:12:37.019
So we start building up that sort of a nonsense
also; this is good for health, this is not

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:40.605
good for health, that is good for health…and
health for what?

00:12:41.018 --> 00:12:43.105
For what is the health?

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:48.476
Health is for having a good attention, which
you don’t have, is lost in the food.

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:54.418
And some people I’ve seen, they are just
still lost in food, completely.

00:12:54.418 --> 00:13:02.771
Though they have got a glimpse of sahaja yoga,
but still they are very much attached to food.

00:13:02.796 --> 00:13:11.188
So that sort of an attitude must be changed,
we should see where we go and get ourselves

00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:14.928
attached and lose our attention.

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:21.409
This is very important that we should be very
careful about our attention, where is it?

00:13:21.409 --> 00:13:26.318
So now the attention moves on with that, I
mean those who still move further and don’t

00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:31.769
jump on the banks, still move in the river,
further on.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:37.489
Attention goes on, then they think that you
see this kind, it works all the time the insecurity

00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:38.758
part of it in it.

00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:45.128
So that this food will be lost, so what should
we do to have better food.

00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:48.738
So they start thinking of money.

00:13:48.738 --> 00:13:52.729
So you know that the barter system became
a system of money.

00:13:52.729 --> 00:13:54.928
People started having money.

00:13:54.928 --> 00:14:02.769
But then apart from food, clothing, other
things started and people started moving with

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:06.589
it to the Mahakali power more and more.

00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:09.815
And the creative power more and more.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.038
The banks are also becoming subtler and subtler,
the movement is also becoming subtler and

00:14:14.063 --> 00:14:15.063
subtler.

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:23.599
So as the man started moving higher and higher,
arts developed on the right side and the idea

00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:27.733
of quality of life or quality of security
changed.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:35.909
So the both the sides becoming subtler and
subtler and the growth becoming subtler and

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:41.757
subtler, man gets again lost into those subtler
banks, on the right and the left.

00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:44.166
Still you have to move further.

00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:47.408
So the Mahalakshmi power takes you higher
and higher.

00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:51.428
That time then you think you must express
yourself.

00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:54.849
And the expression starts in arts, culture.

00:14:54.849 --> 00:15:03.758
It starts also in your living, in your institutions
of security, like political advancement, political

00:15:03.758 --> 00:15:11.688
institutions and that’s how human beings
reached a point where now they think they

00:15:11.688 --> 00:15:20.604
have done that was all possible, but still
in a subtler way they are still lost.

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:28.194
So the Mahalakshmi tattwa went up to say Christ,
up to that point and still people have not

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:31.376
gone into the subtler side of that.

00:15:31.685 --> 00:15:40.149
They are still on the banks, moving towards
the banks, not in the centre of it.

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:51.079
In sahaja yoga, what happens is that the pure
desire, that is kundalini is kept at the beginning

00:15:51.104 --> 00:15:56.149
of the life, just at the beginning of the
life.

00:15:56.174 --> 00:16:00.579
When you were not even a human being.

00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:13.269
Even below is carbon and all the journey from
carbon onwards is to be recrossed again through

00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:16.511
the kundalini.

00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:27.449
All this journey that you did on the superficial
level of this Mahalakshmi stream has to be

00:16:27.449 --> 00:16:39.219
redone in the innermost way, to penetrate
through all these subtler centres, which are

00:16:39.219 --> 00:16:43.093
inside the stream, not outside.

00:16:43.204 --> 00:16:47.379
Because if you are on the outside, you always
go to the banks.

00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:52.328
From where you cannot see any banks, there
is no attention that could be taken to the

00:16:52.353 --> 00:16:55.759
banks, but you move further.

00:16:55.784 --> 00:16:58.614
Like a jet.

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:09.680
And this kundalini is the one that’s the
true desire, but your attention has to be

00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:11.458
on the target.

00:17:11.483 --> 00:17:18.719
Even if you say that the kundalini is the
moving force, still where is your attention?

00:17:18.719 --> 00:17:24.889
Still your attention is on the banks, so you
come up again superficially, you come and

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:29.579
just float superficially and then again jump
onto some bank and then again I’ll have

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:33.063
to put you down inside the water: ‘Go inside,
inside.

00:17:33.088 --> 00:17:36.651
’ Again go back to the kundalini, again
start your journey.

00:17:36.953 --> 00:17:47.169
But from the very beginning steadfast if you
move towards the target, towards the spirit,

00:17:47.169 --> 00:17:48.888
then I have no problem.

00:17:48.888 --> 00:17:54.229
But it doesn’t happen with human beings,
they are so much used to the attraction of

00:17:54.229 --> 00:18:01.369
the banks that they always come up, float,
go to the banks and again sometimes settle

00:18:01.369 --> 00:18:03.388
down there or again come back.

00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:08.008
So the journey is upward, downward, downward,
upward.

00:18:08.008 --> 00:18:10.580
Though the movement of the kundalini could

00:18:10.605 --> 00:18:13.850
be such that you jump like a jet and set down there.

00:18:14.377 --> 00:18:19.179
The day that starts I’ll be the happiest
person because it is too much sometimes for

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:27.839
me, to make this kind of a journey four times
up and down with everyone, because of the

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:30.939
so called attachments they have outside.

00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:38.799
The inner movement with a detached mind, if
they accept the situation and they decide

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:41.075
within themselves that I’m going to do like
this,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.797
I’ve decided on this, they can work it out.

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:45.081
But it’s not so.

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:50.500
Mostly the attitude should be that Mother
is like a mirror.

00:18:50.858 --> 00:18:54.797
And we have a mirror in front of us, so we
know how we are proceeding.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.804
So in the mirror if I see myself like this,
better get rid of it and go on.

00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:04.963
But on the contrary if Mother says something
to someone, that this is so,

00:19:04.987 --> 00:19:08.301
then they feel hurt and again float up.

00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:10.365
The mirror has to say something.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.781
Supposing you have some spot on your face,
the mirror is not going to please you, it

00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:16.347
will say it is there.

00:19:16.372 --> 00:19:20.920
So you don’t hit the mirror and you just
don’t get angry with the mirror, do you?

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:25.013
You see that you clear yourself because you
don’t want to have any spots.

00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:26.923
But just the other way round.

00:19:26.948 --> 00:19:31.444
What happens with people I have seen, that
if you tell them anything or you just tell

00:19:31.469 --> 00:19:37.714
them this is wrong, they’ll first explain,
argue, this thing and if it doesn’t work

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:41.281
out then they will just get angry with sahaja
yoga and give up.

00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:46.465
As if they are obliging sahaja yoga, as if
they are obliging Mother.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.410
Actually you are obliging yourself.

00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:56.389
You are not obliging anyone or if you take
up that kind of an attitude, then only you

00:19:56.414 --> 00:20:01.692
will realize that you have to move forward
without looking left or right.

00:20:01.724 --> 00:20:07.395
So we have had many experiences, quite funny
if you look back you can see that you have

00:20:07.515 --> 00:20:14.265
been sometimes Romeo Juliets, sometimes you
have been money minded people, sometimes you

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.532
have been quarrelling, fighting, arguing type.

00:20:17.557 --> 00:20:19.419
All kinds we have had.

00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:27.859
But those who forget all this and shoot off
towards the goal

00:20:27.884 --> 00:20:30.947
are the best and the most   sensible.

00:20:31.275 --> 00:20:35.789
They are the most selfish people, because
they know what selfishness is, all the rest

00:20:35.814 --> 00:20:39.105
are stupid because they are losing their time.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.690
There are some people I’ve seen who also
try to use sahaja yoga for making money or

00:20:44.715 --> 00:20:49.653
making something for sahaj yog sort of thing

00:20:49.678 --> 00:20:52.741
and making some money out of it or sort of a thing.

00:20:52.766 --> 00:21:02.030
You better make yourself is the best way and
enjoy it in a way that makes you happy and

00:21:02.055 --> 00:21:05.862
makes others happy in the sahaja stream.

00:21:05.887 --> 00:21:11.514
But getting out of the sahaja stream and doing
something is again coming out of that innermost

00:21:11.514 --> 00:21:18.637
channel of Bramha nadi, outward, again floating,
going to the banks, again going down, because

00:21:18.662 --> 00:21:23.287
every time you go down like that you have
to start your kundalini again back.

00:21:23.802 --> 00:21:25.748
It’s a very difficult thing.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.309
And the force of the kundalini gets spent up.

00:21:29.364 --> 00:21:34.444
So one has to understand that if you have
to do this journey,

00:21:34.469 --> 00:21:37.309
you have to be a determined person.

00:21:37.334 --> 00:21:40.203
You have to be a disciplined person, yourself.

00:21:40.228 --> 00:21:43.998
Nobody should tell you that discipline yourself,
do this do that.

00:21:44.023 --> 00:21:44.943
You have to do it.

00:21:44.968 --> 00:21:49.489
What others are doing, first the attention
is there, I mean if somebody brings it here,

00:21:49.535 --> 00:21:51.060
everybody’s attention must go there.

00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:53.035
What is there to see?

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:02.603
But this is nothing, this is very, very superfluous
thing, but even serious things should not

00:22:02.628 --> 00:22:04.485
attract your attention.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:11.879
Your attention should be on the solution of
all the solutions.

00:22:11.904 --> 00:22:19.739
Blessing of all the blessings.

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:23.231
The emancipation of all the emancipations.

00:22:24.438 --> 00:22:29.975
You shouldn’t worry about anything else,
you just worry about that connection, which

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.488
is being established and nothing else.

00:22:32.513 --> 00:22:34.845
Everything is looked after.

00:22:35.386 --> 00:22:38.268
It is as simple as that.

00:22:38.367 --> 00:22:43.153
If this connection is broken the simple thing
is to keep the connection on.

00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:46.322
What’s the use of polishing this, doing
this, doing that?

00:22:46.347 --> 00:22:49.647
Are you going to get the connection back?

00:22:49.672 --> 00:22:56.122
This is a simple, practical thing we find.

00:22:57.109 --> 00:23:04.951
And once we start forgetting that practical
side, we become retarded in our progress.

00:23:05.054 --> 00:23:08.261
And what we find, wherever we are, we are
there.

00:23:08.294 --> 00:23:11.992
Like in this Kolapur I would say, when I come
you’ll see tonight, there will be a huge

00:23:12.017 --> 00:23:14.304
crowd, very huge crowd.

00:23:14.304 --> 00:23:15.676
Always we have.

00:23:16.589 --> 00:23:20.058
Out of them how many really take up this journey?

00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:21.083
Very few.

00:23:23.913 --> 00:23:24.913
Doesn’t matter.

00:23:24.913 --> 00:23:26.249
You shouldn’t mind it.

00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:28.774
Because they are not wise yet.

00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:35.003
But those who become wise, who take up the
journey, also in between ‘jack in the box’

00:23:35.034 --> 00:23:36.294
they come out.

00:23:37.056 --> 00:23:39.607
Suddenly I find somebody floating.

00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:41.805
We are going through the submarine.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.578
And they just jet out.

00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:48.550
This is how it has happened with all our journey.

00:23:48.575 --> 00:23:57.277
And at this place when we are, we have arrived
here not by plane, not by car, not by roads,

00:23:57.676 --> 00:24:03.964
but through the innermost core of our heart,
We have arrived, the bramha nadi.

00:24:03.989 --> 00:24:11.037
We have arrived at Kolapur at Mahalakshmi’s
point, through the most innermost part and

00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:13.590
that’s how we are here.

00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:17.841
So we look at this place in a very gross manner.

00:24:17.866 --> 00:24:21.870
That’s our old habits.

00:24:21.895 --> 00:24:26.607
But the new habit should be vibration wise,
where are we?

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:27.709
What is it?

00:24:27.734 --> 00:24:34.514
Once you develop this, we I can definitely
completely transform this Kolapur in (UNCLEAR)

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:37.361
You are like my channels.

00:24:37.386 --> 00:24:42.613
When you go with me, I use you as my channels.

00:24:42.638 --> 00:24:47.451
But what I find is that the channels are sometimes
crooked, sometimes broken, sometimes there

00:24:47.476 --> 00:24:50.987
are holes and the energy is wasted.

00:24:50.987 --> 00:24:55.237
So it is the duty of all the sahaja yogis
who are travelling with me specially, is to

00:24:55.237 --> 00:24:58.207
be the channels.

00:24:58.207 --> 00:25:04.177
But if you take an attitude that you are here
as guests, you have to be looked after, the

00:25:04.177 --> 00:25:10.195
arrangement should be good, that should be
good, then you have, there is no meaning.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.750
You are travelling.

00:25:13.368 --> 00:25:16.268
You are travelling like saints who travel
with Buddha.

00:25:16.293 --> 00:25:18.821
Even much more, because they did not do anything.

00:25:18.846 --> 00:25:20.568
But you are the channels.

00:25:20.616 --> 00:25:26.002
As you are the channels, you have to keep
your channels open, efficient and you should

00:25:26.027 --> 00:25:28.096
work it out.

00:25:28.096 --> 00:25:37.867
Today is a special day for all of you, is
called as mahabij, the day of mahabij, means

00:25:37.867 --> 00:25:43.344
all the mantra’s have a bija and mahabija
of that is Omkara himself,

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:44.826
Omkar.

00:25:44.851 --> 00:25:52.650
And it’s the first place, this Omkara was
like an egg, Bramhand, they call it Bramhand.

00:25:52.745 --> 00:25:56.697
The whole Bramha becomes a anda (egg).

00:25:56.697 --> 00:25:59.207
Because when they say Bramhand even Sanskrit

00:25:59.232 --> 00:26:01.478
people don’t know that they are talking of an egg.

00:26:01.503 --> 00:26:02.657
Bramhanda.

00:26:02.963 --> 00:26:04.633
The anda of Bramha.

00:26:04.658 --> 00:26:06.147
That is the first beeja.

00:26:06.172 --> 00:26:11.057
And how this Bramha, this vibrations, how
they were created.

00:26:11.057 --> 00:26:20.777
In the first place, when the Devi separated
from Shiva, before that she had gone around

00:26:20.777 --> 00:26:24.106
him as you know.

00:26:24.106 --> 00:26:31.507
And then Shiva told her, Sadashiva told her
that you have to now create.

00:26:31.507 --> 00:26:34.847
And the separation took place.

00:26:34.847 --> 00:26:47.347
So he came out of that pradakshina or you
can call it elliptical form and when he came

00:26:47.347 --> 00:26:55.469
out of it that created a kind of a sound.

00:26:55.494 --> 00:27:03.770
A sound that had this Bramha in it.

00:27:03.913 --> 00:27:09.682
So that Bramha was left in that area.

00:27:10.286 --> 00:27:19.527
As I have told you that first the Devi went
round Sadashiva and created a garland.

00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:26.554
That garland had covered Shiva in it.

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:28.448
Like the nucleus inside.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:34.331
But when Sadashiva went out of it created
a sound.

00:27:34.529 --> 00:27:48.527
And that sound filled the whole of that andakruti,
means the form of an egg and that is the mahabiija.

00:27:48.527 --> 00:27:51.996
That is the Omkara.

00:27:52.671 --> 00:28:07.471
And that is reborn as Shri Ganesh and later
on as Jesus Christ.

00:28:08.306 --> 00:28:12.768
That’s why at Mahalakshmi’s place you

00:28:12.793 --> 00:28:17.062
come with mahabija day, is a very significant thing.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:27.528
Because Mahalakshmi was the mother of Jesus,
Mary and her son was the incarnation of mahabija.

00:28:27.585 --> 00:28:33.733
So to come here on such and such day, and
to do Mahalakshmi’s Puja, is a very big

00:28:33.758 --> 00:28:37.262
privilege, is a great privilege for all of
you.

00:28:37.476 --> 00:28:49.834
And with that privilege you should humbly
do this puja and try to get into that mahabija,

00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:55.854
become one part of that mahabija, which is
this Bramhand.

00:28:55.879 --> 00:28:58.928
The whole Branhand, Bramha’s anda.

00:28:58.928 --> 00:29:10.737
Anda means egg is created, be part and parcel
of that. And not to create any angularity or

00:29:10.762 --> 00:29:17.753
any kind of a misrepresentation but be homogeneous
with the whole Bramha.

00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:26.227
One has to put attention to your Bramha Shakti
which is manifested as vibrations.

00:29:26.227 --> 00:29:32.000
Today the vibrations are so great, that I
didn’t think I would be able to speak on

00:29:32.025 --> 00:29:33.849
this, but somehow I have managed.

00:29:33.874 --> 00:29:38.333
I hope you all have been able to understand
the subtlest of subtle

00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:40.237
that I have talked to you today.

00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:45.198
So when you travel with me you should not
think you have come here to see the whole

00:29:45.198 --> 00:29:46.432
land and all that.

00:29:46.448 --> 00:29:47.694
Or to enjoy life.

00:29:47.851 --> 00:29:53.945
You have come here to become the channel of
your Mother’s work.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:30:00.091
If you understand that, then you will be able
to realize that God has given you a

00:30:00.116 --> 00:30:02.207
very appointed place.

00:30:02.588 --> 00:30:06.341
So I would request you, be deserving.

00:30:06.366 --> 00:30:07.704
Deserve it.

00:30:07.729 --> 00:30:14.100
Assume your seats, coveted places where God
has put you.

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:17.110
May God Bless You.
