00:00.404 --> 00:05.214
Shri Jesus Christ Puja. Bogota (Colombia), 26 June 1989.

00:06.087 --> 00:09.738
Somebody has to translated.

00:33.899 --> 00:39.486
Today I would like to tell you about Christ and Christianity

00:39.511 --> 00:41.716
because that’s very important,

00:41.784 --> 00:46.275
because this country is very Catholic

00:46.813 --> 00:51.892
and even if you are Protestants or Catholics,

00:53.415 --> 00:58.665
the church has not fulfilled

00:59.816 --> 01:02.014
what Christ wanted them to do,

01:02.039 --> 01:04.636
which you can see very clearly.

01:25.411 --> 01:32.704
If you read Bible you’ll find that

01:34.944 --> 01:40.577
Christ has been described as the son of Mother Mary,

01:41.472 --> 01:44.511
born out of immaculate conception.

01:53.954 --> 02:01.589
But we have not been able to really profoundly accept that.

02:09.486 --> 02:14.287
This superficial way they are using Christ

02:14.367 --> 02:19.144
to make money, make properties, build churches.

02:29.106 --> 02:32.613
And because they can not explain anything,

02:32.788 --> 02:35.716
they always say that it is a mystery.

02:40.136 --> 02:44.032
That Christ was born of an immaculate Mother,

02:44.112 --> 02:47.554
‘Inmaculata,’ with immaculate conception,

02:47.586 --> 02:49.853
according to them it is a mystery.

02:55.844 --> 03:07.778
Also they can not explain how Christ walked on the water.

03:13.202 --> 03:17.717
Because they have not been able to find out the spiritual life

03:17.995 --> 03:20.900
which was the idea of Christ.

03:25.399 --> 03:28.144
And they created such materialistic world.

03:31.712 --> 03:36.235
Moreover, the amount of money and wealth

03:36.291 --> 03:40.170
Vatican has, one can’t understand

03:40.226 --> 03:44.447
how there is so much poverty in the Catholic nations.

03:52.476 --> 03:58.344
They have not tried to solve the problem of poverty at all.

04:05.013 --> 04:10.196
In India they converted people by giving them some

04:10.982 --> 04:12.910
loaf of bread or something like that

04:13.006 --> 04:16.415
and very low level people who were just,

04:16.447 --> 04:19.550
we can say primitive, they converted.

04:26.671 --> 04:31.087
Whether they are Protestants or they are Catholics,

04:31.979 --> 04:36.034
they are the two sides of one coin.

04:41.871 --> 04:49.811
Because they are seeking something that is very transitory,

04:53.456 --> 04:57.162
they are not seeking the Eternal Life.

05:00.162 --> 05:08.826
And the people are extremely frozen,
meticulous and rigid.

05:13.637 --> 05:17.771
They only know how to make money, that’s all.

05:20.714 --> 05:27.344
And even the very, very higher people
there have relations with mafia.

05:33.496 --> 05:40.253
So it is something like a religious Mafia,
you can call it.

05:43.918 --> 05:50.526
Also their concept about sex
and married life is extremely funny.

05:56.868 --> 06:04.916
By living an unnatural life,
they have suppressed people so much that

06:04.989 --> 06:11.343
wherever Catholicism has gone,
people have become extremely licentious.

06:21.811 --> 06:25.429
They have no sense of chastity.

06:30.615 --> 06:37.027
Apart from that, what Christ has said
that you have to seek yourself.

06:42.521 --> 06:47.388
The way He has described about a person who is a Christian,

06:47.501 --> 06:50.563
‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.’

06:55.374 --> 06:58.750
Also in the Bible it is: ‘Thou shalt not kill.’

07:02.668 --> 07:07.721
the amount of killing that is done by Christian people,

07:08.848 --> 07:14.243
their sins, God knows how they are going to pay for it.

07:14.307 --> 07:19.777
Through cocaine maybe, I don’t know how.
They have killed so many people.

07:30.457 --> 07:34.488
If they had the white skin they felt
that  they had a right

07:34.647 --> 07:37.314
to kill all others with other skins,

07:42.632 --> 07:46.134
while Christ was not a white skin man at all.

07:48.971 --> 07:51.677
He was brown like us.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.513
He was not born in England or Switzerland.

08:02.551 --> 08:06.407
So to think that if you have a white skin

08:06.487 --> 08:13.296
you have a right to finish everybody is something
like a Hitler’s situation.

08:19.496 --> 08:24.821
But worse than that it is,
because it is in the name of God. Because that

08:28.926 --> 08:32.425
in the name of God you can not do such things,

08:32.746 --> 08:34.809
these are the worst type.

08:41.512 --> 08:48.254
So this is the outside,
but the inside of it is also extremely poor

08:48.445 --> 08:53.996
and extremely detrimental to the growth, spiritual growth.

09:01.059 --> 09:03.756
They don’t know who is Holy Ghost.

09:06.830 --> 09:11.343
They do not want to believe that Christ’s Mother was a Goddess.

09:18.384 --> 09:24.249
In the Hebrew language it was written that She would be a …

09:25.978 --> 09:30.933
She would be a  punya  means a virgin.

09:37.687 --> 09:42.105
Now there is a proper understanding
that She was a virgin,

09:42.113 --> 09:44.985
and then She had a child.

09:49.806 --> 09:53.742
But they have no sense of virginity left.

09:59.821 --> 10:05.527
Now apart from that, Christ has said that
you should seek the truth,

10:05.718 --> 10:09.075
you should seek the Spirit,

10:10.015 --> 10:12.022
they have never bothered about it.

10:20.398 --> 10:24.818
But the main thing that Christ has said, that

10:25.199 --> 10:28.008
that ‘I will send you the Holy Ghost

10:33.290 --> 10:38.932
Who will comfort you, Who will counsel you

10:38.964 --> 10:41.126
and Who will redeem you.’

10:50.312 --> 10:52.637
So, they never looked for One

10:55.637 --> 10:58.621
because they don’t know who is Holy Ghost.

11:00.956 --> 11:05.161
And in the Catholic religion now, even till today,

11:05.291 --> 11:08.763
they do not allow women to be ordained

11:14.629 --> 11:21.880
when Adi Shakti,  which is a feminine aspect of God,

11:21.992 --> 11:24.221
created the whole world!

11:29.482 --> 11:32.807
that’s why the women also, in the West,

11:33.171 --> 11:38.416
have tried to compete with men,
because they have no position in the religious life.

11:45.557 --> 11:50.873
So when the women have no position,
they started competing with men

11:50.953 --> 11:56.906
and they lost their femininity also
and they became very dominating, right-sided.

12:07.248 --> 12:11.811
So what they have been preaching that there should be no divorce,

12:11.843 --> 12:15.287
they made all arrangements that
people should divorce each other.

12:28.836 --> 12:34.367
Now, to understand Christianity,
we have to know through our Sahaja Yoga

12:34.609 --> 12:37.476
that Christ resides in the Agnya Chakra.

12:43.145 --> 12:46.835
And when the Kundalini comes to the Agnya Chakra,

12:46.962 --> 12:49.429
you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

12:49.541 --> 12:52.062
otherwise the Kundalini does not rise.

13:00.739 --> 13:05.620
So once you say the Lord’s Prayer,
Christ is awakened in your Agnya Chakra.

13:11.943 --> 13:16.387
Whenever I travel in the western countries, even here,

13:16.428 --> 13:23.199
My Agnya gets so badly caught up,
and the left Vishuddhi, in a Catholic area…

13:30.035 --> 13:31.143
and Agnya!

13:33.993 --> 13:38.972
That means people are against Christ
and they are feeling guilty,

13:39.020 --> 13:43.834
because all the time the Catholic church
is telling them  that you should feel guilty

13:51.246 --> 13:54.143
and then confess to the priest.

13:58.586 --> 14:02.770
Now the priests are not realized souls,

14:06.061 --> 14:07.601
not the Pope is.

14:09.683 --> 14:17.863
So it is absolutely so artificial,
the baptism itself is so artificial.

14:23.505 --> 14:30.211
Also Christ said that this is the bread,  He said, is My Body

14:30.338 --> 14:34.579
and this Blood is My wine.

14:34.970 --> 14:39.310
He should have said water,  would have been better
for these stupid people, would have been much better.

14:49.715 --> 14:56.654
But even now, if you look that country, you find people
don’t drink water, they drink only grape juice.

15:03.283 --> 15:05.758
So wine doesn’t mean alcohol.

15:09.089 --> 15:17.076
Also they say that Christ made some wine
for the people who had come for the wedding.

15:24.061 --> 15:27.580
The first part of it, that Christ went to the wedding,

15:27.597 --> 15:32.750
itself shows that He respected the custom of wedding.

15:39.551 --> 15:45.455
The second thing is that wine can not be
made alcohol into a second.

15:53.405 --> 15:56.547
The alcohol has to rot,

15:58.951 --> 16:04.779
to become to be... I mean, wine has to
rot to become alcohol inner.

16:11.260 --> 16:17.877
I went to Italy, and there was one gentleman
called Romano Battalia,

16:18.100 --> 16:23.239
who was to interview Me for his TV program.

16:31.774 --> 16:35.710
So he said, ‘First You give me realization, then I’ll do the TV.

16:43.598 --> 16:45.964
So I said, ‘All right, get some water.’

16:49.211 --> 16:53.359
and just I put my fingers into it and I said now drink it,

16:54.058 --> 16:57.460
so he said, ‘This is wine! this is not water.’

17:04.585 --> 17:08.249
I said ‘How?’
He said, ‘It tastes like grape juice.’

17:12.218 --> 17:16.979
the person who brought, he asked it,
‘Did you bring water or juice?’  He said, ‘I brought water.’

17:23.552 --> 17:30.452
so this is also another thing they have used to take alcohol.

17:37.835 --> 17:43.739
They do not understand any subtlety about religion,

17:43.811 --> 17:47.723
about dead bodies, how to deal with them.

17:56.110 --> 18:04.226
Unfortunately or fortunately I lived
very near a church in London.

18:09.757 --> 18:14.637
And the whole day — it was on the back
side of the church, or the side of the church —

18:14.733 --> 18:19.342
the whole day one activity was going on: barrels of beers

18:19.367 --> 18:23.248
were brought in, emptied and sent, the whole day.

18:29.424 --> 18:37.009
And I could not understand how they would be
drinking such a lot of barrels, big, big barrels.

18:41.873 --> 18:46.872
And in the night, if I could ever see,
I would see lots of

18:46.897 --> 18:51.078
spirits coming out of,  horrible black spirits
coming out of the church.

18:56.065 --> 19:00.382
I gave them bandhans and I said, ‘You take your birth.’

19:04.243 --> 19:05.909
But they didn’t want it.

19:07.098 --> 19:11.386
They were mostly bishops, and all sort of people perhaps,

19:11.585 --> 19:13.603
who were buried in that church.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.813
So one day I went to that church

19:23.202 --> 19:25.630
and as soon as I stepped in,

19:25.911 --> 19:30.399
I felt I’ll faint here, because everywhere

19:30.440 --> 19:34.823
there were ten dead bodies, one after another,  buried

19:34.848 --> 19:37.952
in that church, throughout, it was like a churchyard.

19:46.917 --> 19:50.895
That means they have no idea as to where to bury the dead.

19:50.928 --> 19:54.586
In India, even in the churches they will never allow

19:54.610 --> 19:58.348
any dead body to be buried and to walk on them like that.

20:08.720 --> 20:16.723
So in every way they have not gone deep into
themselves spiritually to find out what is the truth;

20:16.808 --> 20:20.721
even they have not been looking out for the Holy Spirit.

20:29.384 --> 20:32.584
So when they say that we are the chosen ones,

20:32.608 --> 20:34.798
and that once we become Christians,

20:34.846 --> 20:38.430
God is going to give us the heavens,  that’s sadly mistaken.

20:44.841 --> 20:48.888
Because whether you are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

20:48.960 --> 20:54.385
you can commit any sin, everybody is capable,

20:54.465 --> 20:57.639
in every religion; no religion binds them.

21:06.662 --> 21:10.864
Only in Sahaja Yoga you become righteous and sinless –

21:16.627 --> 21:19.093
that you give up all your habits,

21:22.039 --> 21:25.234
and also you get rid of your tempers

21:27.362 --> 21:30.660
and your meticulousness,  your frozen nature.

21:34.465 --> 21:37.796
You trust each other, you open your heart.

21:42.159 --> 21:44.669
And you forget about racialism,

21:44.694 --> 21:48.542
about your countries,
and you try to become one with each other.

21:54.134 --> 21:57.570
And when our children will grow up,

21:57.737 --> 22:00.592
we’ll find one collective body,

22:00.648 --> 22:06.576
absolutely forgotten all this nonsensical barriers
between one person and another.

22:12.991 --> 22:15.239
But when you meet a fanatic,

22:15.311 --> 22:19.535
you see, don’t argue with him.

22:24.650 --> 22:28.089
Their brain is covered with fanaticism,
they can not understand.

22:32.703 --> 22:36.129
But any open-minded person, if he asks you anything,

22:36.202 --> 22:39.711
then gradually, one by one, intelligently,

22:39.782 --> 22:43.490
you have to talk in a very sweet manner:
‘See, I was a Christian,

22:43.515 --> 22:47.218
and I could not find it,
and my mind was going on one side,

22:47.258 --> 22:52.294
I was not integrated.’ all these things
you should talk, as if it happened to you.

23:09.764 --> 23:16.129
So then what happens, that
they would start seeing the point and the truth,

23:16.311 --> 23:22.158
that it’s not that you give up Christ,
but we give up the so-called Christianity.

23:32.784 --> 23:37.961
And this way we can get all those half-hearted people

23:38.048 --> 23:41.683
who are neither there nor into anything else,

23:41.735 --> 23:44.005
they will definitively come to Sahaja Yoga.

23:53.294 --> 23:55.661
And there is nothing to feel guilty.

23:58.986 --> 24:03.422
It’s all done by every religion,
they tell you,  ‘You are a sinner.’

24:03.842 --> 24:07.783
Everybody says they can because then they can catch on it.

24:14.666 --> 24:16.533
It’s all Brahma Chaitanya,

24:17.330 --> 24:24.295
which itself in itself creates and sees its own play

24:31.242 --> 24:32.948
and enjoys it sees them.

24:38.201 --> 24:42.298
An analogy can be given like the sea creates the waves

24:42.394 --> 24:45.031
and then sees the waves and enjoys them.

24:51.363 --> 24:56.172
So when we are ignorant, with our ego covered,

24:56.268 --> 24:59.259
every wave thinks that, ‘I’m something great!’.

25:07.940 --> 25:12.360
But when you get  dissolve in the sea, you can feel it.

25:15.849 --> 25:21.869
The vibrations are called as sphurti
in Sanskrit language, sphurti.

25:25.665 --> 25:34.886
And that is turana that vibrations we can call it at that pulsation,

25:35.067 --> 25:39.209
is what you call as Brahma Chaitanya.

25:48.463 --> 25:54.831
So we have to become one with that
and allow it to work it out for us, everything.

26:04.853 --> 26:09.109
So supposing something fails —
if you work out something, something fails –

26:09.157 --> 26:12.260
so we should know it’s working something for our good.

26:19.077 --> 26:24.975
So you never will be frustrated
and you will see the play of Brahma Chaitanya.

26:31.977 --> 26:33.310
May God bless you.
