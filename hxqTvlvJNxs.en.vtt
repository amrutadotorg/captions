Shri Jesus Christ Puja. Bogota (Colombia), 26 June 1989.

00:00:06.087 --> 00:00:09.738
Somebody has to translated.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.486
Today I would like to tell you about Christ and Christianity

00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:41.716
because that’s very important,

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:46.275
because this country is very Catholic

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:51.892
and even if you are Protestants or Catholics,

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:58.665
the church has not fulfilled

00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:02.014
what Christ wanted them to do,

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.636
which you can see very clearly.

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:32.704
If you read Bible you’ll find that

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:40.577
Christ has been described as the son of Mother Mary,

00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:44.511
born out of immaculate conception.

00:01:53.954 --> 00:02:01.589
But we have not been able to really profoundly accept that.

00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:14.287
This superficial way they are using Christ

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:19.144
to make money, make properties, build churches.

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:32.613
And because they can not explain anything,

00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:35.716
they always say that it is a mystery.

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:44.032
That Christ was born of an immaculate Mother,

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:47.554
‘Inmaculata,’ with immaculate conception,

00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:49.853
according to them it is a mystery.

00:02:55.844 --> 00:03:07.778
Also they can not explain how Christ walked on the water.

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:17.717
Because they have not been able to find out the spiritual life

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:20.900
which was the idea of Christ.

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.144
And they created such materialistic world.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:36.235
Moreover, the amount of money and wealth

00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:40.170
Vatican has, one can’t understand

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:44.447
how there is so much poverty in the Catholic nations.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:58.344
They have not tried to solve the problem of poverty at all.

00:04:05.013 --> 00:04:10.196
In India they converted people by giving them some

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:12.910
loaf of bread or something like that

00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:16.415
and very low level people who were just,

00:04:16.447 --> 00:04:19.550
we can say primitive, they converted.

00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:31.087
Whether they are Protestants or they are Catholics,

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.034
they are the two sides of one coin.

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:49.811
Because they are seeking something that is very transitory,

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:57.162
they are not seeking the Eternal Life.

00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:08.826
And the people are extremely frozen,
meticulous and rigid.

00:05:13.637 --> 00:05:17.771
They only know how to make money, that’s all.

00:05:20.714 --> 00:05:27.344
And even the very, very higher people
there have relations with mafia.

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:40.253
So it is something like a religious Mafia,
you can call it.

00:05:43.918 --> 00:05:50.526
Also their concept about sex
and married life is extremely funny.

00:05:56.868 --> 00:06:04.916
By living an unnatural life,
they have suppressed people so much that

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:11.343
wherever Catholicism has gone,
people have become extremely licentious.

00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:25.429
They have no sense of chastity.

00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:37.027
Apart from that, what Christ has said
that you have to seek yourself.

00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:47.388
The way He has described about a person who is a Christian,

00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:50.563
‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.’

00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:58.750
Also in the Bible it is: ‘Thou shalt not kill.’

00:07:02.668 --> 00:07:07.721
the amount of killing that is done by Christian people,

00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:14.243
their sins, God knows how they are going to pay for it.

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:19.777
Through cocaine maybe, I don’t know how.
They have killed so many people.

00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:34.488
If they had the white skin they felt
that  they had a right

00:07:34.647 --> 00:07:37.314
to kill all others with other skins,

00:07:42.632 --> 00:07:46.134
while Christ was not a white skin man at all.

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:51.677
He was brown like us.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.513
He was not born in England or Switzerland.

00:08:02.551 --> 00:08:06.407
So to think that if you have a white skin

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:13.296
you have a right to finish everybody is something
like a Hitler’s situation.

00:08:19.496 --> 00:08:24.821
But worse than that it is,
because it is in the name of God. Because that

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:32.425
in the name of God you can not do such things,

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.809
these are the worst type.

00:08:41.512 --> 00:08:48.254
So this is the outside,
but the inside of it is also extremely poor

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:53.996
and extremely detrimental to the growth, spiritual growth.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:03.756
They don’t know who is Holy Ghost.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.343
They do not want to believe that Christ’s Mother was a Goddess.

00:09:18.384 --> 00:09:24.249
In the Hebrew language it was written that She would be a …

00:09:25.978 --> 00:09:30.933
She would be a  punya  means a virgin.

00:09:37.687 --> 00:09:42.105
Now there is a proper understanding
that She was a virgin,

00:09:42.113 --> 00:09:44.985
and then She had a child.

00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:53.742
But they have no sense of virginity left.

00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:05.527
Now apart from that, Christ has said that
you should seek the truth,

00:10:05.718 --> 00:10:09.075
you should seek the Spirit,

00:10:10.015 --> 00:10:12.022
they have never bothered about it.

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:24.818
But the main thing that Christ has said, that

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:28.008
that ‘I will send you the Holy Ghost

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.932
Who will comfort you, Who will counsel you

00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:41.126
and Who will redeem you.’

00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:52.637
So, they never looked for One

00:10:55.637 --> 00:10:58.621
because they don’t know who is Holy Ghost.

00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:05.161
And in the Catholic religion now, even till today,

00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:08.763
they do not allow women to be ordained

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:21.880
when Adi Shakti,  which is a feminine aspect of God,

00:11:21.992 --> 00:11:24.221
created the whole world!

00:11:29.482 --> 00:11:32.807
that’s why the women also, in the West,

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:38.416
have tried to compete with men,
because they have no position in the religious life.

00:11:45.557 --> 00:11:50.873
So when the women have no position,
they started competing with men

00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:56.906
and they lost their femininity also
and they became very dominating, right-sided.

00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:11.811
So what they have been preaching that there should be no divorce,

00:12:11.843 --> 00:12:15.287
they made all arrangements that
people should divorce each other.

00:12:28.836 --> 00:12:34.367
Now, to understand Christianity,
we have to know through our Sahaja Yoga

00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:37.476
that Christ resides in the Agnya Chakra.

00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:46.835
And when the Kundalini comes to the Agnya Chakra,

00:12:46.962 --> 00:12:49.429
you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:52.062
otherwise the Kundalini does not rise.

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:05.620
So once you say the Lord’s Prayer,
Christ is awakened in your Agnya Chakra.

00:13:11.943 --> 00:13:16.387
Whenever I travel in the western countries, even here,

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:23.199
My Agnya gets so badly caught up,
and the left Vishuddhi, in a Catholic area…

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:31.143
and Agnya!

00:13:33.993 --> 00:13:38.972
That means people are against Christ
and they are feeling guilty,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.834
because all the time the Catholic church
is telling them  that you should feel guilty

00:13:51.246 --> 00:13:54.143
and then confess to the priest.

00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:02.770
Now the priests are not realized souls,

00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:07.601
not the Pope is.

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:17.863
So it is absolutely so artificial,
the baptism itself is so artificial.

00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:30.211
Also Christ said that this is the bread,  He said, is My Body

00:14:30.338 --> 00:14:34.579
and this Blood is My wine.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.310
He should have said water,  would have been better
for these stupid people, would have been much better.

00:14:49.715 --> 00:14:56.654
But even now, if you look that country, you find people
don’t drink water, they drink only grape juice.

00:15:03.283 --> 00:15:05.758
So wine doesn’t mean alcohol.

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:17.076
Also they say that Christ made some wine
for the people who had come for the wedding.

00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:27.580
The first part of it, that Christ went to the wedding,

00:15:27.597 --> 00:15:32.750
itself shows that He respected the custom of wedding.

00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:45.455
The second thing is that wine can not be
made alcohol into a second.

00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:56.547
The alcohol has to rot,

00:15:58.951 --> 00:16:04.779
to become to be... I mean, wine has to
rot to become alcohol inner.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:17.877
I went to Italy, and there was one gentleman
called Romano Battalia,

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.239
who was to interview Me for his TV program.

00:16:31.774 --> 00:16:35.710
So he said, ‘First You give me realization, then I’ll do the TV.

00:16:43.598 --> 00:16:45.964
So I said, ‘All right, get some water.’

00:16:49.211 --> 00:16:53.359
and just I put my fingers into it and I said now drink it,

00:16:54.058 --> 00:16:57.460
so he said, ‘This is wine! this is not water.’

00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:08.249
I said ‘How?’
He said, ‘It tastes like grape juice.’

00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:16.979
the person who brought, he asked it,
‘Did you bring water or juice?’  He said, ‘I brought water.’

00:17:23.552 --> 00:17:30.452
so this is also another thing they have used to take alcohol.

00:17:37.835 --> 00:17:43.739
They do not understand any subtlety about religion,

00:17:43.811 --> 00:17:47.723
about dead bodies, how to deal with them.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:04.226
Unfortunately or fortunately I lived
very near a church in London.

00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:14.637
And the whole day — it was on the back
side of the church, or the side of the church —

00:18:14.733 --> 00:18:19.342
the whole day one activity was going on: barrels of beers

00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:23.248
were brought in, emptied and sent, the whole day.

00:18:29.424 --> 00:18:37.009
And I could not understand how they would be
drinking such a lot of barrels, big, big barrels.

00:18:41.873 --> 00:18:46.872
And in the night, if I could ever see,
I would see lots of

00:18:46.897 --> 00:18:51.078
spirits coming out of,  horrible black spirits
coming out of the church.

00:18:56.065 --> 00:19:00.382
I gave them bandhans and I said, ‘You take your birth.’

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:05.909
But they didn’t want it.

00:19:07.098 --> 00:19:11.386
They were mostly bishops, and all sort of people perhaps,

00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:13.603
who were buried in that church.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.813
So one day I went to that church

00:19:23.202 --> 00:19:25.630
and as soon as I stepped in,

00:19:25.911 --> 00:19:30.399
I felt I’ll faint here, because everywhere

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.823
there were ten dead bodies, one after another,  buried

00:19:34.848 --> 00:19:37.952
in that church, throughout, it was like a churchyard.

00:19:46.917 --> 00:19:50.895
That means they have no idea as to where to bury the dead.

00:19:50.928 --> 00:19:54.586
In India, even in the churches they will never allow

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.348
any dead body to be buried and to walk on them like that.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:16.723
So in every way they have not gone deep into
themselves spiritually to find out what is the truth;

00:20:16.808 --> 00:20:20.721
even they have not been looking out for the Holy Spirit.

00:20:29.384 --> 00:20:32.584
So when they say that we are the chosen ones,

00:20:32.608 --> 00:20:34.798
and that once we become Christians,

00:20:34.846 --> 00:20:38.430
God is going to give us the heavens,  that’s sadly mistaken.

00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:48.888
Because whether you are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.385
you can commit any sin, everybody is capable,

00:20:54.465 --> 00:20:57.639
in every religion; no religion binds them.

00:21:06.662 --> 00:21:10.864
Only in Sahaja Yoga you become righteous and sinless –

00:21:16.627 --> 00:21:19.093
that you give up all your habits,

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:25.234
and also you get rid of your tempers

00:21:27.362 --> 00:21:30.660
and your meticulousness,  your frozen nature.

00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:37.796
You trust each other, you open your heart.

00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:44.669
And you forget about racialism,

00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:48.542
about your countries,
and you try to become one with each other.

00:21:54.134 --> 00:21:57.570
And when our children will grow up,

00:21:57.737 --> 00:22:00.592
we’ll find one collective body,

00:22:00.648 --> 00:22:06.576
absolutely forgotten all this nonsensical barriers
between one person and another.

00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:15.239
But when you meet a fanatic,

00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:19.535
you see, don’t argue with him.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.089
Their brain is covered with fanaticism,
they can not understand.

00:22:32.703 --> 00:22:36.129
But any open-minded person, if he asks you anything,

00:22:36.202 --> 00:22:39.711
then gradually, one by one, intelligently,

00:22:39.782 --> 00:22:43.490
you have to talk in a very sweet manner:
‘See, I was a Christian,

00:22:43.515 --> 00:22:47.218
and I could not find it,
and my mind was going on one side,

00:22:47.258 --> 00:22:52.294
I was not integrated.’ all these things
you should talk, as if it happened to you.

00:23:09.764 --> 00:23:16.129
So then what happens, that
they would start seeing the point and the truth,

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:22.158
that it’s not that you give up Christ,
but we give up the so-called Christianity.

00:23:32.784 --> 00:23:37.961
And this way we can get all those half-hearted people

00:23:38.048 --> 00:23:41.683
who are neither there nor into anything else,

00:23:41.735 --> 00:23:44.005
they will definitively come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:53.294 --> 00:23:55.661
And there is nothing to feel guilty.

00:23:58.986 --> 00:24:03.422
It’s all done by every religion,
they tell you,  ‘You are a sinner.’

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:07.783
Everybody says they can because then they can catch on it.

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:16.533
It’s all Brahma Chaitanya,

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:24.295
which itself in itself creates and sees its own play

00:24:31.242 --> 00:24:32.948
and enjoys it sees them.

00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:42.298
An analogy can be given like the sea creates the waves

00:24:42.394 --> 00:24:45.031
and then sees the waves and enjoys them.

00:24:51.363 --> 00:24:56.172
So when we are ignorant, with our ego covered,

00:24:56.268 --> 00:24:59.259
every wave thinks that, ‘I’m something great!’.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.360
But when you get  dissolve in the sea, you can feel it.

00:25:15.849 --> 00:25:21.869
The vibrations are called as sphurti
in Sanskrit language, sphurti.

00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:34.886
And that is turana that vibrations we can call it at that pulsation,

00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:39.209
is what you call as Brahma Chaitanya.

00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:54.831
So we have to become one with that
and allow it to work it out for us, everything.

00:26:04.853 --> 00:26:09.109
So supposing something fails —
if you work out something, something fails –

00:26:09.157 --> 00:26:12.260
so we should know it’s working something for our good.

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:24.975
So you never will be frustrated
and you will see the play of Brahma Chaitanya.

00:26:31.977 --> 00:26:33.310
May God bless you.
