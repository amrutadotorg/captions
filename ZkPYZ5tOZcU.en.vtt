00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:13.954
Just like a gardener cultivates a garden

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:18.700
and waters it with love

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:22.070
and then goes on watching

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:32.508
that how many flowers have bloomed in the garden.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:46.408
The joy a gardener gets on watching it, cannot be explained.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.204
The meaning of the name 'Krishna' is from agriculture.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.030
'Krishi' you know means cultivation.

00:00:57.055 --> 00:01:03.189
During Krishna's time, there was cultivation

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:12.238
and during Christ's lifetime, it was irrigated by his blood.

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:18.027
The fertile land of this world

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:27.442
had been adorned by so many incarnations before.

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:31.157
Now in Kaliyuga, the time has come

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:38.580
to witness the blossoming of that farming

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:45.991
to feel the fragrance of its flowers.

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:53.917
The vibrations that are flowing from your hands

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:57.278
is the same fragrance

00:01:57.303 --> 00:02:02.474
because of which the whole world, the whole creation

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.852
the whole nature is functioning.

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:14.616
But you are the chosen flowers, which have been chosen ages before

00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:17.886
that you will blossom today

00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:25.098
and this fragrance within you, after spreading in the world

00:02:25.123 --> 00:02:38.933
will put an end to this mud, to all the filth of this illusory world.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:49.221
At the outset it seems, how is it possible?

00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:53.728
Mother is telling a great thing.

00:02:53.753 --> 00:03:02.337
But it is a series, it is a continuous process.

00:03:02.362 --> 00:03:04.792
And when the destination is in front of you

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:05.791
then to think that

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:09.972
why did this destination come? How did it come? How can it be possible?

00:03:09.997 --> 00:03:15.553
When you were walking, was not the destination reached?

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:21.902
When you were seeking, will you not get your destination?

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:30.736
But when it has been achieved, why should there be doubt about it?

00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:41.708
Today I want to tell you about three powers

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:46.771
that God is only one, He is not two.

00:03:46.796 --> 00:03:50.689
I am one, not numerous

00:03:50.714 --> 00:04:00.674
but I am your Mataji, My husband's wife, My children's mother

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:08.104
am your Divine Mother, am their worldly mother.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:16.655
In the same way, God has three aspects.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.093
His first aspect is that He is in His  witness form.

00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:29.056
He is a witness to His play of His power Shakti, which He watches.

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:36.102
We call Him God and we call His power Divine power or Ishwari.

00:04:36.127 --> 00:04:41.646
In our Sahajyoga we call it, Mahakali Shakti (power).

00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:47.536
When His Witness state SWARUPA comes to an end

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:53.664
means when He doesn't want to see anything,  when He dislikes

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.280
When He shuts His eyes to the play of His Shakti

00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:04.029
at that time everything comes to an end.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:09.564
That is why this shakti is called Samharak Shakti (power of Destruction)

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.335
In reality, it is not destructive

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:23.450
but it organizes the work of the whole world

00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:29.859
and puts an end to it.

00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:41.202
The second power that the Almighty utilizes is His Trigunātmika Shakti

00:05:41.227 --> 00:05:46.115
which He uses to create the whole world.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:58.292
In that the huge planets and stars are created

00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:12.289
by which it becomes the most sacred thing of the earth.

00:06:12.314 --> 00:06:18.199
In this state, God Almighty is called Hiranya Garbha

00:06:18.224 --> 00:06:22.037
and His Power is called Hiranya Garbhini.

00:06:22.062 --> 00:06:31.886
In our Sahajyoga, it is called as the power of Maha Saraswati.

00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:41.620
The third power of God Almighty is Virat Swaroop, is Virat Shakti.

00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:47.793
The power by which living beings are created in the world

00:06:47.818 --> 00:06:55.759
their evolution takes place

00:06:55.784 --> 00:06:58.163
from an animal he becomes a human being

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:01.014
and from a human being He becomes super human

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:08.462
and from a super human he becomes Almighty.

00:07:08.487 --> 00:07:17.335
This Virat Shakti in Sahajyoga, we call Mahalaxmi.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.450
In this way, there are three powers in the world

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:29.734
which spread God's splendour.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.991
The first power should be called 'Ishvareey Shakti'

00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:35.126
second 'Hiranya Garbhini'

00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:40.867
and thid 'Viratangana'.

00:07:40.892 --> 00:07:55.316
the work of Sahajyoga is the work of Viraat.

00:07:55.341 --> 00:08:01.102
The Almighty has bestowed all the three powers in humans too.

00:08:01.127 --> 00:08:04.900
With one power, man accumulates whatever is dead.

00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:07.821
That is the power of Mahakali.

00:08:07.846 --> 00:08:16.032
With one power, man does all the future planning, thinking or reflection.

00:08:16.057 --> 00:08:20.125
That is the power of Maha Saraswati.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:33.926
And the power with the help of which, he evolves

00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:40.253
is the power of Mahalaxmi.

00:08:40.278 --> 00:08:41.980
The integration of these three powers

00:08:42.005 --> 00:08:48.789
is in the Virata's body in His Sahastrara.

00:08:48.814 --> 00:09:06.700
He is the Adi Purush (Primordial Man).

00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:16.748
The Mahalakshmi power goes on reorganizing Her work  for living beings.

00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:19.766
She makes so many selections, makes several choices

00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:26.872
and leads the deserving people, deserving animals

00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:30.322
to a certain level of evolution.

00:09:30.347 --> 00:09:35.447
but when he comes to the level of human beings, he gets complete freedom

00:09:35.472 --> 00:09:41.547
so that he in his consciousness, in his own awareness

00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:44.610
will seek his own path for his own evolution.

00:09:44.635 --> 00:09:49.537
And will come to know, how his evolution has taken place.

00:09:49.562 --> 00:09:53.345
Neither animal thinks about his evolution

00:09:53.370 --> 00:10:00.381
But only a human being thinks and can see and know

00:10:00.406 --> 00:10:06.843
when he gets these vibrations.

00:10:06.868 --> 00:10:14.158
You have reached the destination, you are standing in the coutyard

00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:17.303
Sahaj is so simple

00:10:17.328 --> 00:10:26.080
but man only has complicated his ownself

00:10:26.105 --> 00:10:35.841
It becomes very difficult for man to live in simplicity and innocently

00:10:35.866 --> 00:10:44.238
And religion is nothing but simple innocence

00:10:44.263 --> 00:10:54.004
But how can we talk of innocence when so many brains have evolved?

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:59.262
That is why very small chidren get their realisation in no time

00:10:59.287 --> 00:11:03.009
because of their innocence.

00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:06.161
So many things are going on in Kaliyuga.

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:09.308
Most probably you are not aware of it.

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:13.131
As the Virat Shakti has become more powerful

00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:16.877
at the same time in the hell

00:11:16.902 --> 00:11:23.676
where just like waste material many degraded souls

00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:28.982
those whom we call Rakhshas, their powers too get stronger.

00:11:29.007 --> 00:11:31.521
The competition of both these powers is going on.

00:11:31.546 --> 00:11:36.561
One power is dead and the other is living.

00:11:36.586 --> 00:11:40.689
The dead energy can never be stronger than the living power.

00:11:40.714 --> 00:11:46.532
But the living energy is always very sensitive, tender.

00:11:46.557 --> 00:11:51.020
Because of this, it becomes a little bit difficult for it to flourish.

00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:57.328
A plastic flower can never be beautiful than a real one

00:11:57.353 --> 00:12:00.028
can never be more important.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:04.546
But plastic flowers can be manufactured in thousands.

00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:09.184
live flowers bloom just three or four.

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:15.277
That is why those who thrive in Sahaja Yoga

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:21.993
those who have achieved something in Sahajyoga they also wither.

00:12:22.018 --> 00:12:24.778
They wither again.

00:12:24.803 --> 00:12:33.047
Just as a mother nurtures her child with great love in her lap

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:42.893
in the same way, Sahajyoga nurtures.

00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:48.656
But a child has the power to recognize his powers.

00:12:48.681 --> 00:12:56.557
After getting Sahajyoga, a human being can reach that state

00:12:56.582 --> 00:12:58.958
can reach within a short span of time

00:12:58.983 --> 00:13:03.022
for which the great saints and sages had to take thousands of births

00:13:03.047 --> 00:13:14.067
and had to meditate for thousands of years and ages.

00:13:14.092 --> 00:13:26.780
We are extremely fortunate that we are born in this special era.

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:35.434
We are normal people born for unusual work.

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:40.313
The unusual force is behind the curtain, helping you.

00:13:40.338 --> 00:13:49.212
But Virat has chosen unusual ones to be seated on His Sahastrara.

00:13:49.237 --> 00:13:57.768
because the ordinary have power, not the unusual ones.

00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:01.335
But in sahajyoga, first and foremost thing is that

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.298
innocence must be inherent.

00:14:03.323 --> 00:14:08.898
Be peaceful anf satisfied.

00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:10.691
Be contended.

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:14.747
Someone or the other has some or the other sorrow

00:14:14.772 --> 00:14:18.877
some or the other problem, confusion.

00:14:18.902 --> 00:14:20.384
One gentleman started saying in London

00:14:20.409 --> 00:14:23.624
a war is going on in Vietnam, what are you talking?

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:25.495
I told him," Are you going to Vietnam?

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.756
Are you the Prime Minister of that country? Why are you bothered?

00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:34.174
You look at your inner self."

00:14:34.199 --> 00:14:40.405
We shouldn’t fill our lives with small, trivial problems.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:45.113
Even if a straw gets into our eye, our eye can get damaged.

00:14:45.138 --> 00:14:55.271
It has no importance.

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:57.924
Be peaceful!

00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:59.330
Because the time has come

00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:02.645
when God's Kingdom is going to be established in the world.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.933
Be contented!

00:15:06.968 --> 00:15:13.175
Sahajyogis should be more peaceful than other people.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.801
Be full of contentment.

00:15:15.826 --> 00:15:32.248
Should bloom and fill the whole world with with their joy.

00:15:32.273 --> 00:15:36.036
Sahajyoga will show some innate miracles.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:47.830
A forceful churn is going on, shake-up is going on.

00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:54.088
Some of you here are new people who have come

00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:57.928
and some are very old

00:15:57.953 --> 00:16:00.560
Some new people easily reach great levels

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:06.573
while some older ones are still sitting here.

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:11.841
The one who has faith in the limitless grace of God Almighty

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:15.398
who knows that He is the creator of the entire universe

00:16:15.423 --> 00:16:18.198
and it is He who helps us sail through.

00:16:18.223 --> 00:16:22.909
He in a moment

00:16:22.934 --> 00:16:26.258
gets his realization in Sahaja Yoga and establishes himself there.

00:16:26.283 --> 00:16:32.108
And once he settles down, he never regresses.

00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:36.478
Strengthen your faith because such a thing is flowing through your hands.

00:16:36.503 --> 00:16:43.078
You have seen its miracles. Trust yourself.

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:48.110
Know yourself.

00:16:48.135 --> 00:16:51.121
Something more is going on.

00:16:51.146 --> 00:16:54.898
I have seen many small children

00:16:54.923 --> 00:16:58.573
within whom great saints, your fathers and forefathers

00:16:58.598 --> 00:17:01.830
are taking rebirth, to help you all.

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:07.181
Within 10 to 12 years, many great people will come in this world.

00:17:07.206 --> 00:17:11.347
Make preparations to welcome them.

00:17:11.372 --> 00:17:15.417
Earlier they had been crucified.

00:17:15.442 --> 00:17:17.894
They had been beaten and killed.

00:17:17.918 --> 00:17:21.280
All of them are going to take rebirth now.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.125
A new era is going to come in this world.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.965
It is a little tough time for us.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.239
Have faith in God.

00:17:31.264 --> 00:17:34.878
The essence of all religions

00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:38.520
the blessings and hope of all religions

00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:49.269
that man will get connected to God will be true.

00:17:49.294 --> 00:17:52.856
We will meditate for some time.

00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:54.750
Don't have to do anything.

00:17:54.775 --> 00:18:01.351
The seed that is within you in a dormant state will flourish.

00:18:01.376 --> 00:18:04.514
Close your eyes and witness your thoughts.

00:18:04.539 --> 00:18:08.026
Those Who  are sick, have physical pains

00:18:08.051 --> 00:18:12.032
are victim because of the lack of blessings of Laxmi ji

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:20.009
have every type of problem, will definitely get solved

00:18:20.034 --> 00:18:31.633
but the one who is real guest, his coming is a necessity.

00:18:31.658 --> 00:18:35.421
Every one put your hands towards Me like this.

00:18:35.446 --> 00:18:45.019
And whatever is past, dead ,your knowledge

00:18:45.044 --> 00:18:54.561
your sorrows, your problems and whatever future plans you have

00:18:54.586 --> 00:19:00.695
hopes, disappointments and all worldy thing  which are troubling you

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:11.894
give up all that this moment, right this moment, now at this moment get awakened.

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:17.267
To awaken, the fourth dimension will open in the present only

00:19:17.292 --> 00:19:20.218
neither it is in the future, nor in the past.

00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.234
So this moment you should get that

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:23.514
this very moment is important

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:24.232
where you are sitting

00:19:24.257 --> 00:19:31.066
this moment only you have to jump and you don't have to move further.

00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:33.907
To awaken at this moment only is Sahajyoga.

00:19:33.932 --> 00:19:55.520
Spontaneous salvation.

00:19:55.545 --> 00:19:56.874
Don't move.

00:19:56.899 --> 00:20:02.488
Close your eyes put your attention towards your forehead on Sahastrara.

00:20:02.513 --> 00:20:05.888
where there is Fontaneal bone, pay your attention.

00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:07.727
Put your attention there.

00:20:07.752 --> 00:20:09.133
Do not force it.

00:20:09.158 --> 00:20:12.844
With ease, just think about what’s happening at the top.

00:20:12.869 --> 00:20:16.072
As you think about your household while sitting here.

00:20:16.097 --> 00:20:18.412
peacefully

00:20:18.437 --> 00:20:22.740
and slowly in your hands

00:20:22.765 --> 00:20:26.436
may be to some of you in the beginning there may be a burning sensation

00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:28.143
a little

00:20:28.168 --> 00:20:31.261
shake it (your hand) if you feel heat

00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:40.568
and if you don't feel burning sensation

00:20:40.593 --> 00:20:43.887
just keep your hands in a  normal way

00:20:43.912 --> 00:20:49.230
and you will feel that inside cool breeze is coming.

00:20:49.255 --> 00:20:51.379
If you take your attention to your forehead

00:20:51.404 --> 00:20:55.742
you will see there is no thought.

00:20:55.766 --> 00:21:09.172
This is thoughtlessness, you will become thoughtless.

00:21:09.196 --> 00:21:12.693
Just sit with complete peace from within.

00:21:12.717 --> 00:21:14.732
Be absolutely peaceful and tell you mind

00:21:14.757 --> 00:21:15.170
“ This is enough.

00:21:15.195 --> 00:21:18.249
You are trying to tell me many things and now don’t try to tell me anything".

00:21:18.273 --> 00:21:19.782
I have to go there only.

00:21:19.807 --> 00:21:23.697
This mind that is disbalancing you, this itself is testing you.

00:21:23.722 --> 00:21:41.319
Tell him to stop it.

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:45.701
Sahaja Yoga works in collectivity, it’s not for one person

00:21:45.726 --> 00:21:54.682
It is not an indivisual. All of you are pores of Virat (One collective being).

00:21:54.707 --> 00:22:02.651
It is not dependant on one person.

00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:06.645
All of you are cells of the same body, you will come to know .

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:11.027
It is collective consciousness.

00:22:11.052 --> 00:22:15.048
You are not alone. You are the part and parcel of one body.

00:22:15.073 --> 00:23:04.586
There is no one else, everyone is your own which you will come to know.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:09.543
Those who have come today, have never come, keep sitting.

00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:14.585
Those who have come earlier and those who have got realization, those who know

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.281
they can get up slowly and move to the back

00:23:17.306 --> 00:23:27.083
they can go one by one slowly, stand at the back and look after other people.

00:23:27.108 --> 00:23:31.316
Nobody will disturb, get up slowly, go to the back and watch

00:23:31.341 --> 00:23:32.652
And those who have come just now

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:34.556
will keep sitting with their eyes closed slowly.

00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:37.930
And those who are getting vibrations in their hands

00:23:37.955 --> 00:23:40.738
The newcomers, those who have come new

00:23:40.763 --> 00:23:44.679
those who are getting vibrations in their hands

00:23:44.704 --> 00:23:49.489
new people in whose hands something has started to flow

00:23:49.514 --> 00:23:51.084
raise their hands.
