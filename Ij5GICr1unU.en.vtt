00:00.709 --> 00:08.667
Adi Shakti Puja

00:30.750 --> 00:38.709
2004, Cabella Ligure, Ä°talya

05:45.333 --> 05:50.875
Today's meeting is very special.

05:51.875 --> 05:55.041
It's a very, very special day also,

05:55.208 --> 06:02.542
extremely special and very blissful.

06:04.375 --> 06:12.542
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

06:13.834 --> 06:25.542
about the born Order

06:25.750 --> 06:32.125
born Power,

06:34.166 --> 06:40.750
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

06:41.959 --> 06:46.041
And this one is responsible

06:46.250 --> 06:52.959
for creating this great universe.

06:54.834 --> 07:02.083
Why this has started and how it works out is...

07:02.291 --> 07:04.667
already you know;

07:04.875 --> 07:07.291
I need not talk about that.

07:08.458 --> 07:12.792
But today we have to talk about this Power,

07:14.667 --> 07:18.667
which is hidden in your hearts,

07:19.667 --> 07:24.667
by which you can do whatever you like to create

07:24.959 --> 07:30.667
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

07:30.959 --> 07:34.291
everything that is not known so far.

07:36.417 --> 07:41.375
That is quite possible;

07:43.667 --> 07:48.458
that is quite possible and is being done,

07:48.667 --> 07:52.542
but what is difficult is

07:52.709 --> 07:59.417
how to make people more adaptable, more

08:04.208 --> 08:09.250
in tune with each other, absolutely.

08:09.583 --> 08:15.250
It seems to be a difficult thing.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.959
They're all right among themselves,

08:19.208 --> 08:23.083
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

08:23.417 --> 08:30.166
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

08:30.375 --> 08:36.709
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

08:36.917 --> 08:39.625
and it should not be done.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.375
That's not supposed to be;

08:42.667 --> 08:45.458
they're not supposed to be like that,

08:45.667 --> 08:50.458
but it has to work out.

08:51.041 --> 08:52.959
Now the problem is,

08:56.291 --> 09:01.291
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

09:02.583 --> 09:03.959
but they do not become

09:04.291 --> 09:08.583
so one with each other as they should have.

09:09.333 --> 09:13.125
Now, how to solve this problem?

09:13.291 --> 09:15.083
Many people have asked Me,

09:15.375 --> 09:20.166
"Mother, how to make that problem";

09:20.375 --> 09:21.834
I just smiled.

09:22.834 --> 09:26.792
Because, if you see the original idea

09:27.083 --> 09:36.375
why we started this x ray

09:36.667 --> 09:39.500
why we started this new kind of a

09:44.792 --> 09:51.083
understanding, new kind of penetration -

09:51.375 --> 09:58.875
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

09:59.166 --> 10:00.417
in every person.

10:01.041 --> 10:07.417
Now you should be very much thankful that

10:07.625 --> 10:12.208
you are all one, one inside,

10:12.417 --> 10:14.375
there's nothing second.

10:14.667 --> 10:20.333
There's only one and that one when it speaks

10:20.542 --> 10:26.250
and when it wants to administer something,

10:26.750 --> 10:31.667
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

10:31.875 --> 10:36.792
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

10:37.291 --> 10:42.750
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

10:43.959 --> 10:51.500
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

10:51.792 --> 10:54.875
roving into some sort of a problem,

10:55.166 --> 10:59.375
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

11:01.542 --> 11:06.083
Now the main problem that we have is that

11:06.375 --> 11:08.875
we don't realize that we have no problem.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.625
We are without any problems.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.667
We think that there are problems and

11:15.959 --> 11:17.583
we should deal with problems,

11:17.792 --> 11:20.959
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.291
I don't see any problem anywhere.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.458
Those who think they have problems,

11:26.792 --> 11:28.875
I've asked them to write it down,

11:29.083 --> 11:30.959
and I'll try to answer them

11:31.250 --> 11:34.375
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

11:34.542 --> 11:38.166
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

11:38.959 --> 11:44.458
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

11:44.750 --> 11:48.792
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

11:50.083 --> 11:55.083
in their hearts of their oneness.

11:55.291 --> 12:02.375
All this comes from within, not from without,

12:03.250 --> 12:07.417
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

12:08.083 --> 12:13.417
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

12:13.917 --> 12:16.166
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

12:16.333 --> 12:24.333
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

12:24.834 --> 12:27.959
any other coding something,

12:28.250 --> 12:31.166
no need; it's all there.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.625
Just you have to be that, to become that.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.792
This is rather difficult to understand for people

12:38.083 --> 12:43.166
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

12:43.458 --> 12:45.083
to become the same.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.709
But you are, you are; because

12:47.917 --> 12:52.041
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

12:52.375 --> 12:56.959
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

12:57.166 --> 13:04.792
One in the sense that your everything,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.583
impulse, every feeling,

13:10.583 --> 13:17.583
every understanding is the same.

13:19.375 --> 13:23.834
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

13:24.041 --> 13:28.667
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

13:28.959 --> 13:33.166
that it is different, but actually it is not.

13:33.458 --> 13:37.375
It is only one, one relationship,

13:37.542 --> 13:42.709
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

13:42.875 --> 13:47.959
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

13:48.166 --> 13:50.959
that whatever one may try,

13:52.291 --> 13:55.291
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

13:55.500 --> 14:01.250
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

14:02.250 --> 14:04.125
you are looked after (by) Her.

14:04.709 --> 14:08.083
Everything seems to be one to Me

14:08.291 --> 14:10.875
while you people think there is a different

14:11.166 --> 14:15.250
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.000
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

14:20.333 --> 14:27.500
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

14:31.458 --> 14:35.500
Myself, I am one with you

14:35.709 --> 14:40.500
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

14:40.709 --> 14:46.166
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

14:46.166 --> 14:50.917
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

14:51.250 --> 14:57.542
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

14:57.750 --> 14:59.625
depends on your temperament.

15:00.750 --> 15:03.792
If that temperament changes a little bit,

15:03.959 --> 15:07.500
you will see the oneness among all of you

15:07.875 --> 15:11.834
and the differences will be lost in no time.

15:12.834 --> 15:15.500
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

15:15.500 --> 15:19.375
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

15:19.667 --> 15:25.750
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

15:26.083 --> 15:29.500
Why? Because I never understood him.

15:29.583 --> 15:35.625
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

15:35.625 --> 15:39.500
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

15:39.792 --> 15:43.542
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

15:43.750 --> 15:47.625
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

15:47.792 --> 15:52.500
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

15:52.834 --> 15:59.959
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.709
So, the truth started long time back,

16:03.834 --> 16:11.667
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

16:11.792 --> 16:19.750
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

16:19.959 --> 16:22.834
and then the truth went away.

16:23.041 --> 16:26.291
Like, I would say, that the snake...

16:26.583 --> 16:32.500
snake was born out of ignorance

16:33.208 --> 16:36.041
that the other snakes started supporting.

16:36.667 --> 16:40.834
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

16:41.000 --> 16:47.834
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

16:47.834 --> 16:52.166
and believing in it and started fighting,

16:52.375 --> 16:55.667
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

16:55.750 --> 17:02.041
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

17:02.125 --> 17:05.500
How much one should follow their nonsense?

17:05.542 --> 17:11.000
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.834
It's very difficult.

17:13.166 --> 17:17.250
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

17:17.583 --> 17:24.917
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

17:25.041 --> 17:26.583
Why?

17:26.709 --> 17:30.333
- Because we are standing in untruth.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.417
Our own understanding is untruth

17:33.583 --> 17:37.291
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

17:37.667 --> 17:43.417
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

17:43.500 --> 17:48.041
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

17:48.041 --> 17:50.792
Should not, but it happens.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.291
So that means there is something wrong

17:53.583 --> 17:56.792
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.208
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

17:59.500 --> 18:03.709
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.875
We cannot face ourselves.

18:07.125 --> 18:10.083
We face others, not ourselves.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.166
We never see ourselves.

18:13.333 --> 18:20.291
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

18:20.375 --> 18:25.333
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.709
And that's how the Mother came here

18:28.917 --> 18:35.208
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

18:35.208 --> 18:41.166
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.458
And you'll be amazed at yourself

18:44.750 --> 18:47.959
how much you have already a knowledge

18:48.250 --> 18:51.375
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

18:51.375 --> 18:56.125
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

18:56.333 --> 19:00.625
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

19:00.625 --> 19:08.583
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

19:08.792 --> 19:10.667
but they are not.

19:10.792 --> 19:14.333
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

19:14.333 --> 19:18.417
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

19:18.583 --> 19:20.500
and they don't have to become anything.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.750
Then there's no problem.

19:23.041 --> 19:26.125
But when you have accepted that there is

19:27.333 --> 19:31.333
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

19:31.625 --> 19:32.917
and you are different,

19:33.125 --> 19:35.834
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

19:35.834 --> 19:43.083
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

19:43.291 --> 19:47.709
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

19:47.750 --> 19:52.125
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

19:52.417 --> 19:54.417
all the same, very much.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.542
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

19:58.959 --> 20:03.333
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

20:03.625 --> 20:06.125
will be solved without any difficulty.

20:06.834 --> 20:09.500
Today's Puja is a special one

20:09.709 --> 20:13.125
because you are doing the Puja of something

20:13.417 --> 20:15.333
that never went into any transformation,

20:16.333 --> 20:22.250
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

20:22.542 --> 20:27.417
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

20:27.709 --> 20:31.875
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

20:32.041 --> 20:34.166
Why anyone has to say?

20:34.166 --> 20:37.917
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.333
That's the point we come to

20:40.375 --> 20:43.333
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

20:43.625 --> 20:47.041
and not to get it lost in the words

20:47.250 --> 20:53.917
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.458
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

20:57.458 --> 21:02.000
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

21:02.000 --> 21:08.041
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

21:08.375 --> 21:09.959
there's no danger;

21:10.583 --> 21:14.417
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

21:14.542 --> 21:18.291
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

21:18.500 --> 21:23.959
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

21:24.083 --> 21:29.041
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

21:29.250 --> 21:33.625
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

21:33.792 --> 21:37.166
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

21:37.667 --> 21:40.709
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

21:40.917 --> 21:45.500
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

21:45.917 --> 21:49.166
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

21:49.291 --> 21:52.542
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

21:52.834 --> 21:59.709
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

21:59.875 --> 22:04.875
being English,  being English, European and all that.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.083
But we are not.

22:07.291 --> 22:11.667
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

22:11.834 --> 22:17.458
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
