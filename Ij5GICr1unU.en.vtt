00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.667
Adi Shakti Puja

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.709
2004, Cabella Ligure, Ä°talya

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:50.875
Today's meeting is very special.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:55.041
It's a very, very special day also,

00:05:55.208 --> 00:06:02.542
extremely special and very blissful.

00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:12.542
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:25.542
about the born Order

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:32.125
born Power,

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:40.750
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:46.041
And this one is responsible

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.959
for creating this great universe.

00:06:54.834 --> 00:07:02.083
Why this has started and how it works out is...

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.667
already you know;

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:07.291
I need not talk about that.

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:12.792
But today we have to talk about this Power,

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:18.667
which is hidden in your hearts,

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:24.667
by which you can do whatever you like to create

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:30.667
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:34.291
everything that is not known so far.

00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:41.375
That is quite possible;

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:48.458
that is quite possible and is being done,

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:52.542
but what is difficult is

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:59.417
how to make people more adaptable, more

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:09.250
in tune with each other, absolutely.

00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:15.250
It seems to be a difficult thing.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.959
They're all right among themselves,

00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:23.083
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:30.166
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:36.709
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.625
and it should not be done.

00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:42.375
That's not supposed to be;

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:45.458
they're not supposed to be like that,

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:50.458
but it has to work out.

00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:52.959
Now the problem is,

00:08:56.291 --> 00:09:01.291
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:03.959
but they do not become

00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.583
so one with each other as they should have.

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:13.125
Now, how to solve this problem?

00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.083
Many people have asked Me,

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:20.166
"Mother, how to make that problem";

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:21.834
I just smiled.

00:09:22.834 --> 00:09:26.792
Because, if you see the original idea

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:36.375
why we started this x ray

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:39.500
why we started this new kind of a

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:51.083
understanding, new kind of penetration -

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:58.875
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.417
in every person.

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:07.417
Now you should be very much thankful that

00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:12.208
you are all one, one inside,

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:14.375
there's nothing second.

00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:20.333
There's only one and that one when it speaks

00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:26.250
and when it wants to administer something,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:31.667
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:36.792
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:42.750
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:51.500
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:54.875
roving into some sort of a problem,

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:59.375
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:01.542 --> 00:11:06.083
Now the main problem that we have is that

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:08.875
we don't realize that we have no problem.

00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:13.625
We are without any problems.

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:15.667
We think that there are problems and

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:17.583
we should deal with problems,

00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:20.959
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.291
I don't see any problem anywhere.

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:26.458
Those who think they have problems,

00:11:26.792 --> 00:11:28.875
I've asked them to write it down,

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:30.959
and I'll try to answer them

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.375
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:38.166
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:44.458
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.792
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:55.083
in their hearts of their oneness.

00:11:55.291 --> 00:12:02.375
All this comes from within, not from without,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.417
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:13.417
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:16.166
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:24.333
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:27.959
any other coding something,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.166
no need; it's all there.

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:34.625
Just you have to be that, to become that.

00:12:34.834 --> 00:12:37.792
This is rather difficult to understand for people

00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:43.166
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:45.083
to become the same.

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:47.709
But you are, you are; because

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:52.041
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:56.959
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

00:12:57.166 --> 00:13:04.792
One in the sense that your everything,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.583
impulse, every feeling,

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:17.583
every understanding is the same.

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:23.834
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:28.667
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:33.166
that it is different, but actually it is not.

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:37.375
It is only one, one relationship,

00:13:37.542 --> 00:13:42.709
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:47.959
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:50.959
that whatever one may try,

00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:55.291
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.250
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.125
you are looked after (by) Her.

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:08.083
Everything seems to be one to Me

00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:10.875
while you people think there is a different

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:15.250
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

00:14:17.542 --> 00:14:20.000
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:27.500
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

00:14:31.458 --> 00:14:35.500
Myself, I am one with you

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:40.500
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

00:14:40.709 --> 00:14:46.166
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:50.917
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:57.542
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.625
depends on your temperament.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.792
If that temperament changes a little bit,

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:07.500
you will see the oneness among all of you

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:11.834
and the differences will be lost in no time.

00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:15.500
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.375
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:25.750
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

00:15:26.083 --> 00:15:29.500
Why? Because I never understood him.

00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:35.625
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:39.500
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:43.542
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.625
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

00:15:47.792 --> 00:15:52.500
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:59.959
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:03.709
So, the truth started long time back,

00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:11.667
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:19.750
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:22.834
and then the truth went away.

00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:26.291
Like, I would say, that the snake...

00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:32.500
snake was born out of ignorance

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:36.041
that the other snakes started supporting.

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:40.834
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.834
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:52.166
and believing in it and started fighting,

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:55.667
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:02.041
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:05.500
How much one should follow their nonsense?

00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:11.000
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.834
It's very difficult.

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:17.250
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:24.917
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:26.583
Why?

00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:30.333
- Because we are standing in untruth.

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:33.417
Our own understanding is untruth

00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:37.291
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:43.417
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.041
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:50.792
Should not, but it happens.

00:17:51.083 --> 00:17:53.291
So that means there is something wrong

00:17:53.583 --> 00:17:56.792
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

00:17:56.959 --> 00:17:59.208
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.709
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:06.875
We cannot face ourselves.

00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:10.083
We face others, not ourselves.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.166
We never see ourselves.

00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:20.291
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:25.333
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

00:18:25.667 --> 00:18:28.709
And that's how the Mother came here

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:35.208
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:41.166
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:44.458
And you'll be amazed at yourself

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.959
how much you have already a knowledge

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.375
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:56.125
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

00:18:56.333 --> 00:19:00.625
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:08.583
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:10.667
but they are not.

00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:14.333
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:18.417
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:20.500
and they don't have to become anything.

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:22.750
Then there's no problem.

00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:26.125
But when you have accepted that there is

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:31.333
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:32.917
and you are different,

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:35.834
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

00:19:35.834 --> 00:19:43.083
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:47.709
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.125
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:54.417
all the same, very much.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.542
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:03.333
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:06.125
will be solved without any difficulty.

00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:09.500
Today's Puja is a special one

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:13.125
because you are doing the Puja of something

00:20:13.417 --> 00:20:15.333
that never went into any transformation,

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:22.250
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:27.417
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:31.875
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

00:20:32.041 --> 00:20:34.166
Why anyone has to say?

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:37.917
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:40.333
That's the point we come to

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:43.333
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:47.041
and not to get it lost in the words

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:53.917
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:57.458
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

00:20:57.458 --> 00:21:02.000
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.041
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:09.959
there's no danger;

00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:14.417
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

00:21:14.542 --> 00:21:18.291
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.959
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:29.041
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.625
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:37.166
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:40.709
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:45.500
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:49.166
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:52.542
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:59.709
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:04.875
being English,  being English, European and all that.

00:22:05.208 --> 00:22:07.083
But we are not.

00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:11.667
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

00:22:11.834 --> 00:22:17.458
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
