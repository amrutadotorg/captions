00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:07,952
Public Program 23 April 2002
Lütfi Kırdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

2
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:28,486
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

3
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:42,507
I am very happy to see you all here
to know about the Truth.

4
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:59,573
Whatever is told about your
subtle being is not yet known,

5
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:07,822
because in your awareness 
you don’t have yet that subtleness.

6
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:18,468
That’s the last, the jump into your awareness of collectivity.

7
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:43,915
I must tell you that in this country,

8
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:48,936
that is Turkey, you have so many Sufis.

9
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:52,472
They called themselves Sufis

10
00:02:52,488 --> 00:03:00,750
because they were cleaned and they were spiritually empowered.

11
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:06,381
They talked of Ruh (spirit) but nobody knew about Ruh

12
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:12,979
and when they talked of Ruh they did not know how to explain

13
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:21,097
– they talked of Ruhani life, but they could not
 explain what is Ruhani life.

14
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:31,304
Ruhani is the life when you are connected
with the all-pervading power of Divine love.

15
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,101
It is a different area into which you enter.

16
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:42,948
Because they could not explain,
 they wrote everything beautifully, describing it.

17
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:49,423
But now the time has come for you to get your Ruhani life.

18
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:51,887
Which is a very important thing,

19
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:55,479
because if you are not connected to the divine power,

20
00:03:55,613 --> 00:04:01,323
whatever you may try,
whatever how so ever you will pray,

21
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:04,636
how much you will read Kuran, it won’t help.

22
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:09,746
Human life is governed with jealousy,

23
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:14,077
with temper, with all kinds of malignant things.

24
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:20,776
And we can see all over the world
the problems are just spreading.

25
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,362
Once they will get into Ruhani life,

26
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:30,832
they will realize that the whole world is one,
 there is a global existence.

27
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,652
What happens  that you jump into the sea ocean of Love,

28
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:41,154
of pure Love, no lust, no greed, nothing.

29
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,429
That’s has to happen

30
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:50,046
because if we are born as human beings,
we must get Ruhani life,

31
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:53,707
for which you cannot pay, you cannot read it,

32
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:58,404
 you cannot understand it with
your human awareness.

33
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:04,025
So, you have to enter into a new dimension of your awareness.

34
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:09,060
Nobody understood the Sufis and they just tortured them,

35
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:13,374
because they were so different, so much higher.

36
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,776
Others could not bear it.

37
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,082
And today, that is going on,
 people are fighting all over the world.

38
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,863
So this is the life of pure Love;

39
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:34,769
but not forced, not torture,
 is just  within you, already existing.

40
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,482
You do not know your Love,
you do not know what you have.

41
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:44,814
All the saints came here, incarnations came here,

42
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,216
prophets came here, nobody understood them.

43
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,990
They only killed them

44
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,061
because majority of the people were not Ruhani.

45
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,838
So, all such ignorant people could not bear the knowledge,

46
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:05,675
the divine knowledge of that great people.

47
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:11,439
Now the time has come for the whole world to become one

48
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:14,480
and to jump into the sea of Love.

49
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:20,605
Which is very, very simple, it is very easy.

50
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:25,298
As I told you, we have already that power,

51
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:30,742
placed in the triangular bone of sacrum
 within us by our Creator,

52
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:33,652
which is to be awakened.

53
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:38,362
And once it is awakened,
 it passes through your  centers

54
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:44,640
and cleanses  them, enlightens them,
 and integrates them.

55
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:50,632
And ultimately, this Kundalini
 you to the divine power.

56
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:55,650
This is what is Miraj as described in the Qur’an.

57
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:58,058
And all of you can get this Miraj

58
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:03,338
and once you get it you can experiment
and get it on your finger tips

59
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:11,651
the cool breeze of the surrounding power of Love.

60
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,887
You can feel it on the fingertips.

61
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:18,150
That is the proof. There is no false [UNCLEAR]

62
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,179
And ultimately, you can also get it coming
out of your fontanel bone area.

63
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:34,465
This is the last bone which was pulsating as a child,

64
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:37,678
and then it closed.

65
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:41,930
But when the Kundalini pierces through that,

66
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:50,229
then only you can feel the connection as cool breeze
 coming out  of your own being.

67
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:53,812
You have shown so much faith in God,

68
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:59,013
so much faith in Kuran, so much faith in Islam,

69
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:04,001
but you have to surrender, Islam means to surrender,

70
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,535
and then you can achieve this awareness,

71
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,790
this higher awareness of divinity within you.

72
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,425
After getting these vibrations also,

73
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:24,502
you can develop a power to know
what is wrong within you, in  your chakras.

74
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,816
and also you can make out what is wrong with others.

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,880
 second how your awareness impact

76
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:38,497
expands to the new dimension of Ruhani.

77
00:08:38,974 --> 00:08:40,912
You all have to become Ruh.

78
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:45,702
But now do not write poetry,
because people do not understand poetry.

79
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:47,872
They misinterpret.

80
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:51,840
I can also write poetry, but I don`t want

81
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:56,574
because I want you to know directly what is the Truth.

82
00:08:56,637 --> 00:09:03,043
Now I must tell you one thing:
you have very genre  country called France.

83
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:06,582
among all the European countries,

84
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:09,468
they are the most idiotic people I have seen.

85
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:15,443
Extremely dirty, they like to have
smelling food smelling everything

86
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:19,253
and drink all the time.

87
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:26,767
And they eat  such very chess [UNCLEAR] ,
even the dogs do not eat them.

88
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,109
And they talk about culture.

89
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,805
They are so immoral.

90
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:38,082
There are eleven countries in South Africa.

91
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:40,966
Benin is on of them

92
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:44,759
and they all became Muslims.

93
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:49,957
I asked them: “why did you become Muslims
and not Christians like these?”.

94
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:58,900
They said over ruinous, they are horrible people
 so dirty, so filthy and so smelly.

95
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:01,502
So many people tried to

96
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:06,589
There is a writer called Molière
who told about them, made fun of them.

97
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:10,966
And there is a beautiful book [UNCLEAR],

98
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,276
written by another writer,

99
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:16,570
who has showed how stupid they are.

100
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:22,718
They have to have lucky from you.

101
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,452
You are so different, you are so capable.

102
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:31,888
I mean I must say you are such a sensible, lovely people;

103
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:38,063
 but keep to your sense, keep to your intelligence.

104
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,163
I am telling you about the French

105
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:43,228
because nowadays they are trying to influence you,

106
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:48,424
also your television. Be careful.

107
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:51,352
They do not know what Ruh is.

108
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:56,566
God knows what sort of Christianity is that,
 just the opposite of Christ.

109
00:10:56,752 --> 00:11:03,909
So please try to keep to your own culture
and to your understanding.

110
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:07,263
And you can get your Realization in no time.

111
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:12,856
I came to Turkey, because if you remember
Christ`s Mother also came here.

112
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,326
And I now know why she came here;

113
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,595
because the people are extremely good and so many Sufis.

114
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,819
It is such a joyful place.

115
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:29,365
I think you all will get your Realization today.

116
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,553
Those ofcourse  who do not want can go.

117
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,014
This is a very very simple thing.

118
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,385
In the meanwhile, I would like to ask you  some questions.

119
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:45,310
Interpreter: Rumi has a saying.
 Mevlana Rumi says,

120
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,627
if I reveal the secret, either I will burn or 
people will burn, everyone will burn.

121
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,514
What he said  is  true.

122
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,880
that was the time that because not aware.

123
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,668
What he said is truth because
people don’t understand what is reality,

124
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,321
they can’t believe like that,

125
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,147
they could fight tried

126
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:15,594
they tortured Muhammed Sahab,
 they tortured everybody.

127
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,653
Interpreter: You said about the  love,

128
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:27,591
he said about to love that you mean spoke
 and he was just thanking you.

129
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:30,251
 Allright. Thank you, thank you very much.

130
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:35,119
I am not afraid.
 They can burn me, I don`t care.

131
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,206
Interpreter:  You said that the French are not  good 
 for the whole  peace.

132
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,239
Does that mean the  whole of the  French people?

133
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,029
No, no, there are exceptions, of course,

134
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:55,938
there are many exceptions, no doubt,

135
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:59,339
that's how I came to normal life.

136
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:19,744
Interpreter: She said Reiki and she doing together
 with Sahaja Yoga another Reiki.

137
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:23,734
Please, I would say, don’t do it.

138
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:27,918
Interpreter: Why it doesn't go, Reiki and Sahaja Yoga
why it doesn't go together?

139
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:32,441
Because I've  seen people who do that, get sick.

140
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,097
There is no science behind it.

141
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:37,647
You must know what for you stand, not blind for it.

142
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,743
Interpreter: What about there  after death?

143
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:45,877
That's mean discuss that death, 
you're very young, goes in process.

144
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:52,786
Interpreter: Do you think about it.

145
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,072
No

146
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:05,278
Interpreter:  What is the cause of lying, why do people lie?

147
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,855
Because they don't know the truth.

148
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,460
What only the trac the power of truth.

149
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:21,159
Interpreter: Is on the benefit of yoga, is  the power of thoughts.

150
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:22,763
No, no, no.

151
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:24,749
Beyond thinking you go,

152
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,990
that will no danger of you

153
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,788
You go beyond  thinking.

154
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,029
Interpreter:How, how we go beyond thinking?

155
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:37,318
With the Kundalini, it takes  there.

156
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,952
Interpreter: Is it the power which awakens, the Kundalini,

157
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:47,495
is it the power of thinking

158
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:54,394
 It 's the all pervading power, once you get 
your realization instead of talking this matter.

159
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:02,159
Interpreter: Could you explain the meaning of bindi?

160
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:06,719
It is in India, we put all married women, alright?

161
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:24,237
Interpreter: We heard that people wash
your feet and drink the water from your feet

162
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:27,983
and why the people bow in front of you?

163
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:30,733
All false.

164
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,302
Interpreter: Is this a sect?

165
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,469
for what?

166
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:49,033
Interpreter: People bow front  on you, is this a sect?

167
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:50,847
Of course they bow on me,

168
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:53,112
if the people wants to bow, what can I do?

169
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:15,934
Interpreter: How can people understand your value, your worth?

170
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,230
First you get your self realization, you will know yourself

171
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:22,480
then, you don't know yourself, how can know me?

172
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,512
Interpreter: For what reason have  you started that mission?

173
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:33,576
Don't think you need peace?

174
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:48,199
Interpreter: The question is, the sufi's d
on't have realization from the prophet,

175
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:54,717
where did you get your realization from
and do you see yourself as a prophet?

176
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,323
Don't worry about me.

177
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,884
Interpreter: I beleive in Yoga and
I want to do know that, I beleive that

178
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:16,336
the country where the yoga is most needed now  is  Israel.

179
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:20,670
What do you think and  your [UNCLEAR]
 what do you think about this?

180
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:24,468
You can't help them, historicly they are stupid.

181
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:49,376
Interpreter: She is inviting you to Ankara next year.

182
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,987

183
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,313
Interpreter:  What is  ones partside  affects the rise of Kundalini?

184
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,691
The risen effect no doubt

185
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:03,090
but we can work  it  out,

186
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,542
but you dont  worry about the past,
we have to think about present.

187
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:12,884
Interpreter: we have some physical world problems

188
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:19,167
and he is asking that it would be
dangerous for  keep Kundalini to rise,

189
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:24,563
why there is this  physical health progress.

190
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:37,690
About cleaning the body, does he have to clean
 the body before the having  the realization.

191
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:42,241
Not necessarily, but people do it, good.

192
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:04,247
Interpreter: He is asking if we can now  realization?

193
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,263
Of course.

194
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,044
Interpreter: Just, there is one question,

195
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:11,549
What problem [UNCLEAR] .one has to have realization.

196
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:18,266
Interpreter:,Every messenger has to face next goal

197
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:22,579
what do you ... what is  your next, next to  goal,

198
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:24,978
do you see yourself as a prophet?

199
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:29,036
You don't have to find out about me,
 you have to find out yourself

200
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:45,475
Interpreter: He is asking that do you thin
k those sufis had their Kundalini awaken

201
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,732

Interpreter: and he says that most of them
 is not succeeded in save the humans.

203
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:52,891
They were tortured,

204
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:57,198
how do you think bourgeon space to humanity?

205
00:19:57,225 --> 00:20:00,083
People are so bad and so cruelly,

206
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:03,283
and they always torture the good people.

207
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,172
What is humanity now.

208
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:28,164
Interpreter: What is the difference between
 Kundalini and Prana?

209
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:30,789

00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,011
Interpreter: Do you want your self realization?

211
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:51,502
Interpreter: Can we shut down these (air conditoners)

212
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:55,975
In Quran, Muhammed Sahap has said,

213
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,558
at the time of resurrection,
your hands will speak.

214
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:02,251
This is the Ruh.

215
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:12,268
If they don't speak, the something wrong.

216
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,358
Please close your eyes,

217
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,609
there is no mesmering that is going on.

218
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,294
Dont worry about me, worry about yourself.

219
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:03,096
Put the hands to me like you do in Namaz.

220
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:23,368
(Shri Mataji:blowing towards to microphone)

221
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:49,083
Now see, there is cool breeze [UNCLEAR].

222
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,457
it could be also hot.

223
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:56,664
Doesnt matter, it will cool down.

224
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:00,230
Now put your right hand to top of your head,

225
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:04,574
above the fontenella bone area,

226
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:07,252
hot or cool breeze, see for yourself

227
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:10,029
There is a cool breeze coming out of your head

228
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,358
[UNCLEAR]

229
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,570
If it is hot also, doesn’t matter,

230
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,477
but it should be cool

231
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:23,671
after sometime it will become cool.

232
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,172
for which you have to meditate.

233
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,867
They will teach you how to do it.

234
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:32,560
There are many centers lucky  here.

235
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:55,373
Again put your hands towards me,

236
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,572
like this, like this.

237
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,414
like this.

238
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:28,283
All those who have felt the cool breeze

239
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:33,200
on the fingertips or on their plam

240
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:40,190
or out of the head, can raise your hands.

241
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:08,874
You don't have to pay as your not get
 anything for  the realization

242
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:11,654
You don't have to pay anything.

243
00:25:11,796 --> 00:25:15,027
Gradually you learn everything on your fingertips

244
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:17,648
If you have any problems,

245
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:20,433
 let it down and lets  [UNCLEAR]
