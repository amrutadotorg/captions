00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:36.640
[ASIDE - NOT ALL RIGHT. DO YOU THINK THEY CAN HEAR ME? ITS NOT SO GOOD.]

[INAUDIBLE] in My hand

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.380
One may ask a question - there have been so many saints, prophets, Incarnations

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:39.540
on this earth and whatever they preached, whatever religion they started

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:48.040
people would not keep to the teachings of these great people.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:55.620
All the teachings were absolutely to the point

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:03.880
according to the time they were facing, according to the contemporary problems they were facing.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:11.740
But none of these have been able to keep the framework

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:18.820
what they wanted to establish and all of them have deviated, without exception.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:25.420
Some are money oriented, some are power oriented, some are politics oriented,

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.580
none of them are Spirit oriented - this very surprising.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:40.660
There came lots of philosophies, theories and deviations that people formed.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:47.400
Many religions out of one religion, many philosophies out of one.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:58.400
So people lost faith in religions also lost faith in God,

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.140
lost faith in Divinity - they took to Science

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.280
and what Science has given us, you know very well.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:16.600
It has given up physical slavery to Science - complete slavery.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:24.680
We can't live without electricity, we can't live without plastic -

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.460
above all we have to live with Atomic bomb and Hydrogen bomb.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.560
This is what Science has done again to make compartments

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:48.320
Also the artificial theories that came up in the West

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:56.380
and in the East also - we have lots of intellectuals even in India - which is just a mental projection

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.980
and this mental projection moves in a linear direction

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:09.760
and again recoils back like boomeranging, the idea, the very idea which was projected.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:19.520
Thus we find confusion in these modern times that is one of the characters

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:27.640
of the modern times that people will be confused. They will not know what is the truth, what is not the truth

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:36.580
and then they'll groping for it and when they will be groping for it there will be many in the market, will be selling the truth.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:47.540
This all has happened already. Most of the sellers have been exposed

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:55.580
and people have realized that there must be something more like an evolutionary process

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.560
which is a living energy which works it out.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:08.720
So, we have reached the rational conclusion that there has to be something beyond

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:19.140
to know the Truth which is Absolute. We don't live on a Absolute level - it's all relative.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:26.140
Some say communism is good, some say materialism is good, some say capitalism is good

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.640
but everywhere you go to find it has failed.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.980
I've been now to all these countries who used to be such staunch believers of

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:42.780
Communists, Communism and also democracy. So one is money-oriented,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.920
another is power-oriented

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:57.080
If you see the infrastructure of all these

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:06.460
great philosophies put into our practice, you'll be amazed to see that it's all broken, finished

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:13.660
and there's nothing that you could call as the Absolute Truth.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:21.380
All their political policies, economic policies , everything in a turmoil

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:27.680
and it's nothing but experiencing on [UNCLEAR]. This experiencing

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:35.160
works out against the very principle of what they wanted to do.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:44.400
That's how you find the fake gurus, that's why you find the people are so confused. Whatever they thought was absolutely right,

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:51.740
has turned against them, so what is it that we have to do, where have we missed the point,

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.600
where have all these religions have missed the point?

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:02.280
You'll be amazed if you read about Christianity or Islam or Buddhism,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:11.940
Jainism, Sikhism, any of these things, you will be amazed the principles of all these are about the same

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.760
and so beautiful. No rigidity,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:26.280
there is no fundamentalism, no chance of fundamentalism, encompassing everyone

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:36.000
but the way people have become now - they're so antagonistic. They think they are the best, the rest are useless.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:44.540
How can any religion divide people? No respect for any knowledge

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:53.200
neither any seeking. The second [UNCLEAR] as I told you - either it is the power or it is the money,

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.580
nothing beyond that. Are we

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:07.900
just here for these temporary powers or

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:16.200
for this money which is already showing it's teeth to us?

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.720
What are we here for, what is the purpose of our life,

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:27.500
why God has made us from amoeba to human stage, what was His mechanism,

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:36.340
what was His desiring? If this is His mechanism, which He has very nicely built,

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:44.080
nicely built on such a subtle level that we have to just feel it -

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:52.180
this is all there. Now, when I'm talking to you, you should not take Me for granted because blind faith is not going to help you at all

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.580
but should be treated as a hypothesis

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.480
and should have a very scientific attitude of a very open mind.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:10.280
When you have that kind of a open mind, then you'll see that if it works, if

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:17.800
you get connected with this All-Pervading power and a real yoga, the union takes place

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:25.520
and you can feel it on your finger-tips, this All-Pervading power of God which is described in every,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.880
every scripture. You may call it by any name, doesn't matter.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:36.300
The seed is called by several names all over the world - seed remains seed.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:45.500
If you can feel that, then you are at that point of Absolute Truth. At this Absolute Truth

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:53.080
you can never divide human beings because everybody knows the same truth,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.820
everybody achieving that truth within himself.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:04.120
The second thing which has failed our religions, our philosophies, our politics is that

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:12.380
that whatever we believe be true or whatever we follow did not became an innate part and parcel of us -

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.060
is outward. For example, I'd say about Christianity -

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:27.900
Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." What a subtle sense of morality!

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:35.900
Even the eyes should not be adulterous - there should be no lust and no greed in the eyes.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.200
If you find Christians, they are away from this.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:49.920
They have a brand. They have Christian brand, this brand, that brand. [UNCLEAR] Christ has said, "You're to be born again,"

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.240
so they brand themselves, "We're born again." Just by branding you do not become that.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:03.220
You have to be what you are talking about.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.000
Whatever you talk, you have to walk the same way but that's not possible for human-beings.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:18.300
I've been with Mahatma Gandhi and he was a very great disciplined personality himself and he used to discipline others also.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:25.700
Tremendous disciplining he had and at that time, I found, the people

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:32.880
become very disciplined, very righteous, very good - all kinds of things happened just when he, till he lived

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.040
but when he died everything dropped down - nothing left there.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.340
Dropped down like a worn out coat, everything was thrown away.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:52.240
What was the reason? They believed that Gandhiji was very good, alright -

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:59.020
they said they followed Mahatma Gandhi but they didn't imbibe anything that Mahatma Gandhi was saying.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:06.380
But it is not possible unless and until you are the Spirit, you do not have the power,

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:14.520
you cannot bear even money, power, relationships, anything.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.420
It's something that is missing in human-beings. Until this missing point is there,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.800
we cannot reach what we are supposed to feel.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:36.280
And we are in Canberra and you must be knowing My husband has been a beaurocrat all his life and I've seen most of them.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:42.580
I have to tell them that there is a Kingdom of God into which we have to [UNCLEAR - ENTER?]

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.100
then only we can change, then we can change

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:57.520
everything that looks so confusing, everything that is all the time in the danger of being exposed,

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:04.740
everything that we are afraid of because you really jump into that new awareness

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.140
and in that new awareness, you see things very clearly.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:19.620
At the human level what do we do? We live either in the past or in the future -

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:27.540
we cannot be in the present. At this moment you are not in the present just

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:37.840
you stop listening to Me immediately some thought will come from your past or from your future like the waves,

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.440
waves of the sea and you think you are be drowned in these waves -

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:49.200
there are some thoughts which are very frightening, very few thoughts are there which really nourish you.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:59.340
But supposing, you get out of that and sit in a boat, then you can watch, you can watch all these thoughts

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:07.300
without being in thought, that is you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:15.840
You just watch these thoughts and watch your problems and supposing you learn how to swim, you can jump in

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:22.820
and save many others and give them that life which you have achieved.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:31.180
But as a result of this, what you get is not the mundane thoughts but you become a master.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:38.440
If you want, you can think about it and then you'll be surprised, the revelation that you get.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.180
The revelation about the problems that you have, the revelation

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.280
about others, about yourself.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:57.540
This can only happen if this Kundalini rises within you and pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.180
and you become one with this living force

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.160
which we call as All-Pervading power of God's love.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:16.480
You can call it as Param Chaitanya, in Sanskrit it's called. Some call it Brahm Chaitanya, some call it Ruh - there are many names given to this.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.220
When we see these beautiful flowers here, we take them for granted.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.820
How do these flowers got their beautiful colors - from this Mother Earth,

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:38.740
from a little bit seed that we had planted, how this Canberra has been

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:45.780
enriched with such beautiful trees and flowers? We just take it for granted - who has done this?

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.920
Who has made us from amoeba to this stage?

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:59.840
Look at our eyes, what a camera it is! Look at our brain, what a computer! Who has programmed it?

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:06.440
We just take everything for granted but there is a power which is All-Pervading,

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.040
which exists in each and every atom,

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.500
which exists so close to us, works all the time

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.220
but we are not aware of it. They say there is an Autonomous Nervous System within us

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:30.960
which has got Sympathetic and Parasympathetic, two types of nervous systems

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.960
but who is this Auto - just giving a name doesn't solve the problem.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:45.280
This Auto is the Spirit, is the Spirit which is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:54.000
In those days of Science to talk about God also is criminal but He exists. Whether you like it or not, it can be proved.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.460
It can be only proved when you become a realized soul,

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:06.620
when you become an enlightened soul otherwise it cannot be proved.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:13.000
Just like supposing you take a leaf and show to someone and say there are lots of cells in it -

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:20.640
unless and until you have a microscope, to see the subtle side of a leaf, you cannot convince anyone. In the same way,

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:27.860
unless and until, you get your Self-realization you cannot, by no means

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:35.640
you can achieve the proof of God, proof of Divinity, proof of Spirituality

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:42.220
and you are all that, you are Divine, you are glorious within yourself.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:48.520
All these powers are within you, this Kundalini is within you, all these chakras are within you

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:56.420
and only thing is that you have to expand your awareness after your Self-realization.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:04.140
All these problems are your own so why not, why not we get it? If it's our own

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:12.200
why not we have it? If we have a small little hut somewhere we will  fight with the courts, go all over the world to take it out.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.680
But what about the powers that you have within yourself?

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:22.220
Such a lot of property that you have which will not only

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:29.780
give you physical, mental, emotional, complete nourishment, complete balance

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.900
but also the peace that is promised and the blessings.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:44.880
Above all you become a part and parcel of the whole -

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.340
the microcosm becomes the macrocosm. You just become - it's the question of becoming.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:58.940
It's not just giving a lecture to you that this is this - claiming something but it has to happen - it's the actualization I'm talking about.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:06.060
The actualization of baptism that is to take place. It's not just certificate, it's not just like a [UNCLEAR - FLOWERISATION?].

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:12.680
It has to work out innately within you and then all your innate qualities start showing

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:18.600
It's a fact that by this Kundalini awakening blood cancer

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:23.620
another type of cancer - so many diseases have been cured all over the world.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.820
We don't advertise it too much because that means all the time I'll be busy with the sick people only

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:35.900
but it's better to create doctors out of you that you can heal, cure people.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:43.720
There're three doctors in Delhi [UNCLEAR - THEY LIVE IN?]  another capital like Canberra, where we have three doctors who have got

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.320
their MD after doing MBBS in sahaja yoga

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:54.940
to show, certain diseases they have shown which have been cured by sahaja yoga.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:03.060
Now this is not the only thing that you have to achieve, that you should just get your health

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:10.220
alright, it's not the point. What you have to have is a complete command and understanding

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.700
of the Divine laws and they should be innately enlightened within you.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:21.080
Then, you become righteous, righteous with love,

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:28.800
you become a person who is your own, as if you are your own master.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:34.980
The guideline is the light of your Spirit and when the Spirit shines

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:41.780
in your attention, then you become an enlightened person.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:47.500
It starts showing on your Central Nervous system, you can feel it on your finger-tips.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:56.220
There's cool breeze all over - cool breeze of the Holy Ghost they call it and also this is what you feel first time

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:03.940
is the All-Pervading subtle power which you have never felt before. Then only thing you have to know, how to

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.500
use this power for your benefit and for the benefit of others.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:15.660
And then you jump into another dimension which we call as Collective Consciousness.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:23.300
The consciousness you have at the most about yourself - also that's not complete. Supposing somebody is getting a cancer, he's not conscious of it,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:30.740
supposing somebody is getting mad, he's not conscious of it but with this awareness, as soon as you get

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:36.100
into some trouble, you get conscious of it because you're conscious of

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:44.140
your centers which are on the Parasympathetic Nervous system. Doctors will admit honestly that they don't know anything about Parasympathetic

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.820
but it is a realized soul who knows all about it

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:54.420
and he has complete control over his Parasympathetic Nervous system which is the central path.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:03.160
So, this is a fulfilment of all the promises, this is a fulfilment

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:10.700
of all the scriptures and fulfilment of all the theories that are political or economic [UNCLEAR - EVERYTHING?]]

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:17.060
Now for example I would say, if I want the powers, I'm a Capitalist because I want the powers

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:25.600
but I cannot exist with them, I have to distribute so I'm the greatest Communist - at this old age of Mine I'm going round the whole world

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:32.860
travelling, travelling distributing it because I'm a Communist as well - I cannot enjoy them Myself.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:42.280
So, a personality which is developed, is the fulfilment of all our ideas which were running short of the Truth.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:50.980
The Truth was missing. That Truth has now show it, itself to you that you are in control of it.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.420
You know how to handle this power and how to give realizations to others.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:05.860
The Spirit, which is in your attention, is so powerful that a person who has reached

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:13.600
a certain height of his development which we call as doubtless awareness, Nirvikalpa Samadhi -

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:20.040
that state is achieved in no time - can sitting down here can tell you what's wrong with someone

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:26.760
on the chakras. They talk the language of chakras not [UNCLEAR - OUT OF OR OUTER?] person wearing this dress or that dress

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:31.120
but language of the chakras - what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.540
And if you know how somehow, somehow if you find out how to correct those things, you can correct people, you can correct yourself

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:46.700
without feeling obliged or without feeling that you're obliging others.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:54.220
It just the thing that who is the other? If this finger is paining,

00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:00.060
if I look after it, after all the finger is not obliged to Me and I'm not obliged to finger.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:06.980
In the same way if you become a society of people who have brotherhood which is innate,

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:14.900
a society of people who are morality which is innate, society of people which has got

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.580
spirituality which is innate, then who is the other?

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:29.340
We have such a society built in now. Sahaja yoga is now working in 55 nations, as they say,

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:36.060
and we get people in India, once a year, from all kinds of countries -

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:42.500
Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland on this side

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:49.860
also England, France, uh.. Spain, Italy, Switzerland

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:57.060
America - North America, South America, Australia, Japan

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.540
East, East Asian countries - from all over.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:09.600
I've not been to most of them - Africa, South Africa but if you see them

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:16.980
such love, such understanding, such enjoyment of each other. There's no question

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:22.720
of any quarrel or fights, such humour, such sweetness -

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:31.520
it's really such a society has been already spontaneously formed. There are no rules and regulations,

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:37.700
there's no compulsion but your Spirit. Spirit is the one which guides you and if everyone

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:44.000
has the same reflection of the Spirit, there's not going to be any

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:50.900
problem because everybody feels the same love. If you have ten children who are realized souls

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:59.020
and if you tie a, a bandage on their eyes and ask them, "What's wrong with this gentleman?"

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:06.320
they will all point out the same finger. Supposing they point out this finger, you ask that fellow, "Have you got bad, very bad,

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:12.260
trouble with the throat?" "Yes, but how do you know?" "Because the children are showing the finger

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.540
which indicates that this is the problem."

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:24.440
So, there is no need to refer it to any uh.. sort of a specialist,

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.680
everybody is a specialist - even the children know, even the children understand.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:34.560
The other day we had a telephone, we had some sahaja yogi, sahaja yogi sitting there [UNCLEAR]

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.860
I said, "Just receive that phone." He said, "Mother, there's somebody but he's not a yogi," finished. He put down the phone.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:49.020
They have told him, "You're not a yogi, first become a yogi, then tell him." Put down - came and told Me that "Mother, he's not a yogi."

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:59.220
This is just building at your roots, just there - only thing you have to cope around.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.780
But we run after things which have advertising and all kinds of falsehood.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:14.900
One thing one should understand, you cannot sell it. How much did we pay to Mother Earth for these flowers,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.900
how much did we pay to saints,

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.080
to great prophets, to Incarnations?

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:32.420
It's a living process of your evolution and you can't pay for it

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:40.700
but as soon as I say that people think it's something wrong in it because they don't understand anything for which you cannot pay.

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:49.420
It's a very surprising thing democracy, where people have so much of [UNCLEAR] so much talk of God.

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:57.300
Every country has got a church or something there accepted as something final

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.300
but none of them are seeking the truth.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:10.100
They're just comfortable with whatever they have, whatever they are doing.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:17.080
They're not understanding that this is done by their forefathers and their forefathers - what have they achieved?

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:24.980
But now there's a special category of people, a very special category, which William Blake has called

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:32.700
as people of God, "They will know God and they will make others know God."

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:41.740
These are the people who are as seekers, they're [UNCLEAR - SCIENTISTS?] but so many are lost because of the falsehood

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:50.800
that came in this world and people got enamored by it. Whatever it is, it is for us to decide

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:56.560
what we have to achieve. There's so much to be told about it, so much

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:02.580
and you know, I must have given four five thousand lectures in only in English language and many other languages

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.440
but this lecturing is just a

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:16.700
net of words 'Shabd Jaal'. It can only indicate that this is the Truth.

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:23.680
but you have to go there - it's like a signboard. But if you just stand there and read the book

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:27.480
and read the signboard all the time, you'll never reach there.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:34.220
You have to go and see for yourself. Reading about Australia, you don't go to Australia

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:42.880
in the same way, by reading about anything or listening about it, you don't go there. And this is what it's not a mental feat

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:51.100
it's beyond that - a evolutionary process by which you become the Spirit which is a very small little distance you have to cross

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.700
which is your own, for which you cannot pay, is sahaja means spontaneous.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:04.660
You don't have to stand on your heads, you don't have to go to Himalaya, you don't have to do all these torturesome things and you don't have to [UNCLEAR],

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:13.820
you have to enjoy and this is so simple, looks so fantastic - it is, it is very fantastic.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:21.700
See this now. This instrument was [UNCLEAR - STANDING?], everything was built but the connection was not there - it had no meaning.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:29.440
In the same way if you're not connected to the truth, you'll have no meaning. You're leading a life which is meaningless,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:37.420
which has no satisfaction, which has no fulfilment

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:44.260
and it is innately built in you, is this pure power

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:50.100
what you call the pure desire power of Kundalini which is your mother,

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.980
which is an individual mother, she knows all about you.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:04.000
There are people who go on doubting all the time - it's easy to doubt but I would say that

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:11.200
it's easier to get your Self-realization, why not we get it, what should be the objection?

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:20.700
I hope, you will have wisdom to understand what I've said and you stick to your realization.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.120
Of course, I would like to have some questions from you because

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:34.300
I do not want at the time when we are trying to ascend, your mind should just peep in and say, "Oh, you should have asked this question."

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.520
but I'd like you to ask Me some questions.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:44.780
Because there's complete freedom in sahaja yoga - you have to have Absolute Freedom and for that you have to have complete freedom.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:55.860
What's up? Still not alright? The connection is loose.

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.200
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:19.180
Now, you have put it off. Hello Neeraj, he's put it off again.

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:27.120
- [UNCLEAR]
 - It's alright.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.460
Interesting.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:39.520
[LAUGHTER] [UNCLEAR] Off [ALL LAUGH]

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:58.720
No questions? ... that nourishes them, establishes them - the complete balance

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.860
and then is connected with the mains and

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:08.580
this energy then starts flowing through all the time.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:18.200
Homeopathic is alright in a way

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.200
but I would say, that also is symptomatic.

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:29.660
What is your symptom? You go to a homeopath, he'll ask you ten questions. I mean, sometimes you won't even know what to answer.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:36.780
Then he'll say that, "Alright, I'll give you this medicine, you try." Then suddenly you find boils coming out of your body

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.380
so you say, now this has happened. He'll say, "No, no it's alright. It's coming out, is alright.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:47.400
Uh.. your antibodies have been activated and they're fighting it out."

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:57.360
But in sahaja yoga it's not symptomatic. It's not from outside you treat but from inside

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.660
in the sense that, when the Kundalini rises,

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.720
She passes through the centers, specially the center which we call as the Center heart.

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:17.020
Center heart is the center which creates antibodies till the age of 12 years or so

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.180
and then these antibodies are distributed in the whole body.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:27.820
Whenever you're afraid or when there's problem, there's attack from outside,

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:35.060
then this sternum bone starts pulsating and it's a remote control and conveys the danger

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:43.080
to these antibodies but here, you challenge the antibodies all the time.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:50.000
It's like giving a vaccination sort of a thing. When you challenge the antibodies, afterwards they get tired

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:57.440
so that also system is not alright. Now instead of that, you must nourish the antibodies.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:04.660
That's what is done through sahaja yoga - they can become very strong, active.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:11.820
So many antibodies are killed by this but with sahaja yoga, they not only

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:17.620
are nourished but they live very long and they have greater sense to fight the disease.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.680
In both these systems there's no talk of Spirit at all.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.960
It doesn't deal only with your physical side.

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:46.640
Physical is not everything. I've met people who are uh.. very healthy people.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.120
They have come to Me saying that, "Mother, we want peace."

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:59.900
Some people say, "I don't know how to love." Specially people who are over healthy uh..do not know how to love others,

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:07.100
to have compassion. Mostly people who do Hatha yoga for physical upliftment

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:13.760
or who jog also, they become very dry, extremely dry and end up with a divorce or something.

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:21.000
So only one-sided development is not good - we are not only physical beings. We are mental beings,

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:25.700
above all we are Spiritual beings so we have to have a balance.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:44.120
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:58.460
[INAUDIBLE] She says she doesn't know anything about sahaja yoga, how many attempts would be necessary to?

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:04.480
Oh, it's good. No, no, not many attempts are needed only just now

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:11.180
you'll be awakened. I'm sure you all will be awakened this evening. We have a center here,

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.960
very good center, we are very senior sahaja yogies, in the sense they may not be in age but in knowledge

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:26.340
and they'll tell you all about it, absolutely free. It's not like this that first lecture is free and the rest is all [UNCLEAR -LYNCHING?] - it's not like that.

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:35.040
But you have to give some time to yourself, you have to respect yourself and your Self-realization. What happens, people get their Self-realization

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:40.760
and after that they are like just sprouted beans - finished. So you have to grow.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:49.080
It's very easy to understand, it's so simple and they'll manage it for you, you must just listen to them, practice it

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:55.260
and you'll be amazed it's such a miraculous thing, it's such a miraculous thing

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.100
and so many things happen unbelievable.

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:06.460
You're all the time under protection, you're looked after materially also,

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:12.300
familywise, in every way - it's another world you enter into.

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:26.840
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:38.840
[INAUDIBLE] Some organizations like TM charge money but sahaja yoga doesn't, why is this possible?

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:47.240
Hunh! TM - better not say anything about horrible thing like TM, I mean, you are asked Me, I have to tell you.

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.740
Actually, I come across it long time back

00:59:53.400 --> 01:00:00.340
when a gentleman called Peter Pears who was running the flying academy in Runnock

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:07.660
and I don't know, people are so silly that they join this academy.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.320
Then he brought many TM people to Me and

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:17.320
they were all in a mess, absolutely in a mess. This fellow had epilepsy, his wife had epilepsy

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:23.540
and his director - they have big, big names - director, deputy director, president, this, that

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:30.680
and Mr. Director also had epilepsy and the little girl she too has had epilepsy.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.260
Luckily in those days My husband had gone on leave

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:41.220
so I asked them, "Come and settle down in My house, I'll work it out." Very difficult days!

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:49.600
I worked it out, ofcourse, they got their realization and epilepsy went away. They had become completely bankrupt

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:57.980
because TM was taking all the money in Switzerland and sending all the students there to learn how to jump, I mean, to, to be

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:03.140
uh.. what you call, levitate - absurd.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:12.140
Why do people want to levitate, I don't know what is the need? Already we have problems

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:17.720
with our traffic [LAUGHTER]

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.960
Think of people levitating half-way, I mean, really it's stupidity, nothing but stupidity.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.620
And then this gentleman told Me all the story about TM.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.020
I was shocked, I mean, how could people take to such a nonsense!

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.920
First of all he told Me that they called him that they will give him a mantra, all of them

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:46.760
and these mantras were given by somebody who was sitting there, specially this guru of theirs, they called him giggly guru.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:54.920
Used to giggle must be giggling because that must be thinking how stupid these people are! [LAUGHTER]

01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:01.260
I mean naturally - and he would give them a, a mantra.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:08.840
Now, if there are Indians they'll understand, and very in great secrecy. You see, you had to give them flowers, this, that, I don't know.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:14.200
And they had to pay three hundred pounds beforehand before entering into that room.

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:21.320
And this guru would give them a mantra which was 'Inga', 'Pinga' and 'Thinga' - now Indians  know, understand.

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.140
And you are not supposed to tell anybody about it. He didn't even know Sanskrit, can you imagine!

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:32.760
Now 'Inga' means what - 'Inga' means the bite of a scorpion, in a local language.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:39.880
'Pinga' means when a person gets a spirit he goes round and round -'Pinga' and 'Thinga' is when you show it somebody like this.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:46.900
[LAUGHTER] And they paid three hundred pounds for that. [LAUGHTER]

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:54.100
Then the second course started, people got very sick with that - they pained and all that.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.200
So many, even bureaucrats from India, went into that nonsense - that painful time.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.960
Then they did another course that is of levitation.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:13.080
So they told Me there's a barrister, a Jew lady, she told Me how she suffered.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:20.080
They were all asked to go to Switzerland in a very remote hotel

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.320
and they had to pay six thousand pounds for that course, apart from travelling and all that

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:36.540
and there were uh... what you call, foams,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:44.720
foams kept about one foot high and they were asked to jump on it. The course was for seven days

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:51.940
and for five days they had to drink the water which had boiled the potatoes

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.500
and the sixth day they had to eat the rind of the potatoes and the seventh day they were given the potatoes -

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.300
for six thousand pounds [LAUGHTER]

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.260
It's a fact, I tell you, it's a fact and stupidly they did it!

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:20.380
And they jumped on these things and broke all their bottoms and they, you know, there was a case in America against them

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:27.640
and when they and they're very good at money because after all if you earn money like this, you see,

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.940
and they claimed  money, they gave the money - hushed out.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:41.000
And also very criminal - they tried to kill this Peter Pears. They threw him out of the train one day somebody.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.180
So, they are good at advertising;  Every time they start a new stuff.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.280
This time they have started, say Ayurveda - for Ayurveda, why do you need TM?

01:04:53.200 --> 01:05:00.240
Ayurveda cannot work out in the West because the uh.. medicines and all that are made

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:09.060
in the fields of India. Unless and until they are made into pills and things, they cannot be used but for that you don't need TM.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:18.660
If you want to do Ayurveda, is better that you get directly from some Ayurvedic society something but why to have this TM in between?

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:27.380
And talking that you become very dynamic. In the beginning, you see, it's all what we call is as Shamshan Vidya, is the

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:33.860
uh... Spirits they use. So if you put a, if you put a Spirit on somebody

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:41.600
that person is so ambitious, the Spirit itself, and then this person ambitious, they become very ambitious, both of them.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:48.200
But a horse on which two persons are sitting, that horse becomes absolutely tired after sometime, though it runs fast.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:57.840
And then they are recluses - there are so many recluses in TM. They have no money, they have taken out their children from schools.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:05.780
I mean, it's true they charge lot of money, I've already told you. But sahaja yoga has nothing to do with this kind of a nonsense absolutely.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:14.780
All those people, have already told you, taking money from you, in the name of consciousness, awareness, are all cheats, take it from Me, all of them.

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:22.140
But still is on. You know about Rajneesh how he was but still, in Australia, you find so many

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:30.120
disciples of Rajneesh still going mad. They are all suffering so much all from so many troubles - very painful diseases they have

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:36.940
but what to do? They don't want to come to truth - some sort of a mania if it is.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.600
I asked people that why do you want to pay, he said, "Then you're sure that there's something we'll achieve."

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:49.220
But I said, "How are you sure? Because you're paying for it, because there's a commitment."

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:56.560
I said, "How much will you pay for your Self-realization, it is so invaluable, how much?"

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:05.180
We should use our brains but surprisingly, most of the bureaucrats are in it, in this team.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:13.900
And there are some people who are paid money to give advertisement, like this Peter Pears, was told to say that

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:20.740
he was sitting there and he was meditating, suddenly he passed through the wall. But I said, "Why did you tell a lie?"

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:29.100
He said, "I told more lies." "What?" He said I told them, "I came to America without a passport, without anything, just through this levitation."

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:34.860
But I said, "Why did you tell such lies?" He said, "He was a very rich diamond merchant

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:40.700
and all the money was involved into this. When I got into it completely upto this much

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:46.260
then this guruji told me that if you don't tell lies, how will you recover your money - you have to tell lies."

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:54.780
Just imagine, you just go to America sitting down here - and people believe it.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:00.500
And they advertise with these people. They pay them and ask them to write such things.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.060
Why? It's all money-making.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:15.240
But I don't know the credibility of this man, especially in India. My husband has been a bureaucrat, a well known bureaucrat, he has so many awards

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:21.460
I think, he has got the maximum number of awards uh.. from all the nations

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:27.280
he's, I mean, in the who's who it's written that he's the man who has been awarded the most.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:34.540
They won't trust Me, they will trust this man who was just a ticket collector once upon a time.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.300
Can you imagine?

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:49.100
Whole thing is such a fraud but people like it

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.960
and you have freedom to waste your money where ever you feel like - you can't help it.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:03.500
It's a fact. This man is writing a book now, Peter Pears, but he still has problems.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.660
Suffered a lot, suffered a lot, this man, he's become a bankrupt and he had to go to South Africa.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:20.780
Because you have asked Me, I've told you otherwise no use describing these horrible things to you - makes the whole atmosphere bad.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:29.360
Just think, just think of something nice. Any other question, please?

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:09.300
Buddha has described

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:18.380
I don't know if you have read about Buddhism, even the Buddhist don't read.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:26.000
He said that when Buddha will come,  the future Buddha, he's [UNCLEAR] Matreya, means the Three Mothers  put together - Matreya,

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:34.700
when Buddhism will come, to it's future state, then there will be Bodhisattwa

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:40.720
means the persons will get their realization, they'll become Buddhas but it won't be individual,

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:48.800
it won't be through hardships and all that but they'll get it, their realization and then that will be put to the use of the people,

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:56.680
to the use of the public and also for the use of solving the multiple problems.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:04.320
All these problems can be solved through sahaja yoga. Ecological problem can be solved only through transformation of beings

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:12.600
because it's human-beings who have brought this. Once they're transformed, all the problems they have created, can be solved.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:20.860
So you have to give it and it's most enjoyable thing is to give realization to others -

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.140
greatest enjoyment in doing that.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:34.480
Yes please. [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:41.060
- Do animals have chakras and Kundalini?
- Yes, yes they have but not so developed as you have.

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:48.280
We have a very good uh... system which is completely sorted out

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.580
This is a deep subject but the brain of a man is like a prism

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:58.980
and because of that whatever energy falls on this brain

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:05.000
is, goes into refraction

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:12.020
and because of refraction we have a clear cut three systems built-in within us -

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.660
two sympathetic, left and right and the Parasympathetic

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:24.300
and so it's a very systematically sorted out. Like in our evolutionary process we used to have say,

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:32.880
lights, electricity in a very different manner. Gradually it is improving, improvement and today it's in a very

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:41.140
great state of evolution. In the same way, we have been born

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.680
in such a manner that it is very suitable for our evolution

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:56.140
but animals also evolve, animals are also evolving. These days when you see all kinds of poor people,

01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:02.840
all kinds of uh.. people who have no feelings for others - they must be coming from some

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:09.940
hyaena group or something like that otherwise how can they be without any heart, without any love -

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:16.760
so dry. So they are also evolving.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:28.060
We have already evolved, we have reached. We are at the end of, epitome of the evolution, we are at the top

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.500
you have to just jump a little more and that's what it is.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:37.760
That's why human-beings must be respected the most, much more than animals or anyone else.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:51.500
Alright, I think we have had quite a lot of questions and also you'll be satisfied.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:58.440
Later on whenever you want to know about it, you can write to Me or you can write to these people but in any case I hope

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:02.720
after realization you will not give it up

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:10.240
and just [UNCLEAR - TAKE TO IT?] because we do not take money from you and that's why [UNCLEAR - LET'S NOT?] involve it

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.100
but as you know there are still problems within us.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:23.500
The Kundalini passes through a very subtle, small, central channel - we call it as Brahma Nadi

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:28.280
and She opens up, no doubt but the connection is not complete -

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.500
sometimes it goes down to various places. Supposing, you have a liver trouble, it will go down to liver trouble,

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:42.020
to other mental trouble or any kind of a trouble like spiritual trouble can come if you have done like TM or anything.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:48.120
If such a thing has happened, then this Kundalini goes to those places and works it out.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:54.300
Now what you have to know, is a very simple thing, is that how do we cleanse ourselves.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:01.480
We don't go to Himalayas, we don't go fasting, we don't give up our families - nothing of the kind.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:06.600
We are where we are. We are not to give up any place, any position, anything .

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:14.060
And to develop within, what is the solution? The solution is that you have to go to the collective

01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:23.620
without feeling what is your position in life, forgetting all that. We don't have elaborate ashrams and all that because we don't make money.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:30.180
It's a humble place. Whatever it is, with humility you must go there, with the collective you have to be.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:36.920
And if you are humble, if you go to the collective, you'll not only

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:43.020
know about sahaja yoga but also you'll grow very fast and the cleansing takes place.

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:50.260
Without the collective, cleansing doesn't take place. That's the only way you can cleanse and you can master it.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.320
For that you don't have to pay, nothing of the kind.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:04.940
If you find any discrepancies, you should write to Me - everybody is free to write.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.580
Because that's how you're purified without any problems, without any [UNCLEAR - DIFFERENCE OR DIFFICULTIES?]

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:22.260
Also a kind of a individual meditation has to be done, which they will tell you - five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.400
It's not done but you become, you are in meditation for five minutes and ten minutes in the night

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:36.360
that cleanses you but collective is very important. In the collective to absorb the vibrations

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:44.260
uh.. what you call, this Chaitanya, this Divine power - in the collective and it cleanses you.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:50.700
Such a different thing to be in Collective and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.960
But that has to be promised that you will have to do the collective.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.480
There's no commitment if you want to give realization, you can give, if you don't want to give doesn't matter,

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:11.340
if you want to evolve yourself, you can evolve yourself but you will feel that because the compassion

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:21.180
and you get concerned about your surroundings, you get concerned about people.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:28.880
It's a personality that develops uh.. which is so full of love, full of feelings

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:33.520
and strength and knowledge so what to do it, you don't want to waste it.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:42.000
I never force anyone to do anything nor will you forced to do anything whatever you want to do, you get it, you can do it

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:46.220
but you have to be in the collective, that's very important.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.440
[UNCLEAR] civil to be because no use watching others

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:05.620
because that creates problems for others. If you want to have realization, then you're welcome and you should get it.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.420
The second condition is very simple again

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.280
that you're not to feel guilty about anything.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:19.620
Past is past is finished now, at this moment you are in the present.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:27.540
To a mother a child is never guilty so please, take away the guilt if there is anything in your head

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:32.060
because also I think, English language has too much of this - sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:38.120
Formerly when we were young, we used to say, I beg your pardon before, now they say sorry - everything is sorry.

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:43.980
What is there to be sorry about? You have to be happy, joyous - so not to feel guilty at all,

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:52.240
not to blame yourself for anything, please - you are not at all guilty about anything.

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.520
Small, small things we talk of which makes us guilty

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:06.020
also these religious teachings, so called, that you are a sinner, you're this, you pay so much money - nothing of the kind.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:13.580
In sahaja yoga first thing you must know you are a human-being, you are a seeker that's why you're here and you're not guilty.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.740
Even if you have done mistakes, if you have gone to wrong places, doesn't matter we can correct it

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:25.160
but don't feel guilty about it that, "I went to this place, I did this, I did that." It  will automatically work out

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:33.080
and you'll be surprised to see your own growth. You should not condemn yourself for anything at all -

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:39.820
this is first condition. Then the second condition is

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:45.580
that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.380
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - what do you do, nothing.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:20:00.520
But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Those who have tortured you are very happy people while you are bothering yourself too much.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:10.560
So, you have to forgive - in general means that you don't have to think of these things which have hurt you

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:18.340
or the people who have hurt you but in general you should say, "I forgive everyone." You'll feel much lighter even now - you forgive everyone.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:26.340
That means, in short, that you must be very pleasantly placed towards yourself that you are a human-being,

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:35.180
that you have every right, your birth-right to get this yoga, to get this union with the Divine, there's Divinity within you which has to rise.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:45.340
If you just understand that it is your birthright as human-being and as a human-being you are at the epitome of evolution

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.040
be happy about it, be pleasantly placed towards yourself

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:57.020
do not to condemn yourself for anything that you have done in the past - forget it.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:03.480
Your mother is Kundalini, knows everything about you and She knows how to manage the way through it.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:10.920
She has recorded everything within Herself like a tape recorder so you don't have to worry, you don't judge yourself.

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:16.940
She will know how to manage, She's so anxious to give this re-birth.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000
These are very simple conditions which may look difficult to some people - is not, is just a mental idea.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:37.640
Forget it. You have to love yourself as I love you, that's the point

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:44.200
and respect, very important because you're seekers.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:50.220
You're seekers of truth and that's why you're much higher than the rest of the world.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:58.720
Now there's one more thing which should not upset you that we have to take out our shoes

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:03.740
uh.. whether you're sitting on the ground or on the chair because it's better

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.120
that uh.. we touch the Mother Earth with our feet.

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:14.100
Mother Earth sucks, sucks in any negative [UNCLEAR - WANTS OR FORMS?] that are within us, just.

01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.100
Also if you have anything very tight in the neck or on the waist, you can just loosen it little bit.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:27.580
So, you should be comfortable. Imagine, sitting on the chair you're going to get your Self-realization! Comfortable.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:36.400
Don't have to go to Himalayas to stand on your head for 10 years - just here, within ten minutes you're going to get your Self-realization.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.040
First we'll show you

01:22:52.680 --> 01:23:00.220
and you will nourish your own centers. This is for only once you have to know later on there's no need at all. After Self-realization

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:07.140
they'll tell you how to raise your Kundalini yourself, how to make the connection alright but in the beginning I will just tell you.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:17.780
Now the left side of the Left Sympathetic is the power of desire, of ordinary desire not pure desire -

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:26.200
pure desire is the Kundalini - and the right side is the power of action so we put the left hand, like this, on our lap,

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.580
very comfortably - you have to sit not too much straight,

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:36.320
bending back or slouching but in a normal straight manner.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:40.240
Please put the left hand, like this, on your lap

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.960
and have full confidence. This is one of the most important thing is to have full confidence in yourself

01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:50.840
that you are going to get realization - no doubt.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.080
Now the right hand we'll use for nourishing our centers.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:05.900
The first thing is the Spirit which resides in the heart so we put our right hand on our heart, is the Spirit.

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:12.360
If you're wearing a coat, you can put inside the coat on the right hand.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:24.100
Now, if you're the Spirit, you become your own master

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:33.100
so the center for your mastery is on the left-hand side of your stomach or you can call abdomen on the upper side.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:42.820
We're working only on the left-hand side. In the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, you put your fingers and press it a little.

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:52.180
This is the center of your mastery - this is created by great masters, prophets, which is to be enlightened.

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:03.560
Then you have to take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.880
This is the center of pure knowledge of Divine laws and also the knowledge how to work it out -

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:15.240
it's very important.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.740
Then again you have to put your hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left hand side.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.680
Please all of you have to do it, please all of you do it.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:37.200
Now put your right hand on your heart, again.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:48.540
Now when you feel guilty the center here

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:55.820
on, in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, here catches very badly

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:04.920
and gives you diseases like Angina, Spondylitis - on the whole it makes your organs very lethargic

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:13.500
so it's no use being guilty. Now turn your head to your right and press it hard here, as much as you can,

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:22.360
knowing that you're not guilty in the eyes of God.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:30.240
Now, put your right hand on top of your forehead across

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:38.920
and you can press it on both the sides - one side with the thumb, another side with your fingers

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:45.060
and put down your head as far as possible. This is a center to forgive,

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.540
to forgive everyone in general.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:58.860
We'll do that later on just now I'm showing you where to put your hand. Now please, take your right hand on the back side of your head

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.840
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:14.220
This is the center, where without feeling guilty - push back your head as far as possible.

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:22.140
This is the center where, without feeling guilty, without condemning yourself, without counting your mistakes,

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:30.040
for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Divine power of love.

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:37.100
Now, stretch your hand fully. Now the last center - very important.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:45.700
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:54.760
Put the center properly. Now, push back your fingers - this is for the actualization of the baptism, as they say.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:28:03.500
Push back your fingers so that there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now please put down your head, as far as possible

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.820
and now move your scalp, slowly, clockwise, seven times.

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:20.740
Please move your scalp slowly, clockwise, seven times. Put down your head.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:29.280
This is the last center called as Sahastrara, means the lotus of thousand petals, which covers the limbic area.

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:47.640
Now, that's all we have to do, that's all.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:56.680
You'll have to close your eyes, when I tell you, you can take out your spectacles - later on you can put them on.

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:06.720
You have to put both your feet apart from each other, as I told you there are two powers separate - one complementary to other.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.580
Just put both the feet apart from each other. Put the left hand towards Me

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:19.020
and now put the right hand on your heart.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:27.060
Please close your eyes. Put close them slowly, not pressing them down but just

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:36.600
close them so that the lids are not pressed and compressed.

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:40.540
Now here

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:55.780
you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself, three times in your heart.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:05.340
Please ask a question within your heart - you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji whatever you feel like.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:14.580
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask this question in your heart. "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:36.280
In the heart resides the Spirit and if you are the Spirit, you become your own master, your own guide, your own guru.

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:44.640
So now, please take down your right hand into the upper portion of your abdomen

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:48.500
on the left-hand side and press it, not very hard.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:54.620
This is the center for the principle of mastery.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.020
So now, you ask another, very fundamental question in your heart, three times

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:08.100
"Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own master?"

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.320
Ask this question three times in your heart.

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.440
I've already told you that I respect your freedom

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:46.680
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you - you have to ask for it.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:52.560
So now, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.240
and here you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals,

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.460
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:11.460
Ask six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:26.480
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts rising

01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:32.680
and when She starts rising,

01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:40.820
we have to understand that we have to nourish all the centers

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:48.540
which are upper centers so that it's easy for Her

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:56.180
to pass through. This has to be done with our self-confidence in ourselves,

01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:04.480
with our self-esteem and knowing what glorious things we are.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:10.180
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:14.840
Here

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:27.400
you have to say, ten times, with full confidence, "Mother, I am my master."

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.380
Say in your heart, "Mother I am my master, " ten times.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.160
Press it hard

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:55.480
Now the fundamental truth about you is that, you're not this body, not this mind,

01:33:56.260 --> 01:34:02.140
not this intellect, nor these conditionings and not your ego -

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:05.820
you are pure Spirit.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.000
So now, raise your right hand on your heart

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:21.280
Here you have to

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.260
say again with full confidence,

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:33.640
"Mother, I am the Spirit, I am the pure Spirit, " say it twelve times.

01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:37.980
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:45.180
This self-confidence will open your hearts, will open your chakras.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:35:01.120
You have to know that this All-Pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion and love,

01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:07.600
is the ocean of bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:14.160
so whatever you may do wrong, whatever you think was against

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:20.560
goodness, please forgive just now, forgive yourself,

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:26.620
completely forgive yourself because all

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:33.780
these mistakes can be easily dissolved by the power of ocean of forgiveness.

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.980
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck

01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:49.780
and, neck and the shoulder and turn your head to your right fully.

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:57.680
Here, very much with your self-confidence, you have to say sixteen times

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.780
because this center has got sixteen petals, sixteen times with full confidence,

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:12.700
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all, Mother, I'm not guilty at all."  Whatever people might have told you, forget it.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.940
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all, " please say it sixteen times.

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.780
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive,

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:33.860
you don't do anything. On the contrary you play into wrong hands.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.260
Those who have tortured you, are not troubled, while you are troubled.

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:53.320
So you have to forgive all of them. Now raise your hand on your forehead across,

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.080
press it hard on both the sides.

01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:01.960
Please put down your head, please put down your head.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.600
Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, from your heart you have to say,

01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:13.140
"Mother, I forgive everyone, in general."

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:19.520
"Mother, I forgive everyone, in general."

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:38.420
Please say it from your heart. This center is a very constricted small center on the cross of

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:45.080
optic chiasma - it has to open out only by your forgiveness.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:53.680
Now, put your right hand on the back side of your head

01:37:55.180 --> 01:38:01.860
on the optic lobe, as they call it, and push back your head as far back as possible towards the sky.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:12.800
Here, you have to say for your own satisfaction, not counting your mistakes,

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:27.460
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:40.520
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything

01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:44.420
wrong against you, please forgive me."

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:52.140
And you have to say this again with your heart, not how many times but from your heart you have to say.

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:08.220
Now, stretch your hand,

01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:12.300
stretch your palm fully

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:20.240
and put the center

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:27.940
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which is a soft bone in your childhood.

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:35.640
Now, put down your head, as far as possible,  put down your head, as far as possible,

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:42.420
and most important is to push back your fingers so there's a good pressure on your scalp.

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:51.100
Again here, I cannot cross your freedom, I respect it. I cannot force

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:58.200
Self-realization on you. Please push back your fingers, please push back. Now you have to move your hand seven times,

01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:06.620
clockwise, slowly or we should say you have to move your scalp, is better. At that time you have to say seven times,

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:14.140
"Mother, please give me Self-realization," seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization,"

01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:18.060
and it will work out. Please put down your head, please.

01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:26.360
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:33.800
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:37.100
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:40.940
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.480
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:54.000
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] Now please take down your hands, slowly open your eyes.

01:40:55.380 --> 01:41:03.220
You can put on your glasses. Now, put both the hands towards Me, like this. Watch Me without thinking.

01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:11.840
You just watch Me without thinking - you can do it. This is thoughtless awareness, Nirvichar Samadhi.

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:22.700
Now, put the right hand towards Me, like this. Put right hand on - please bend your head

01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:31.420
and put your left hand on, not touching it, on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area

01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:35.640
and move it and see if there is a cool breeze

01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:43.920
or a warm breeze coming out of your head. Some people will get hot breeze - they have bad liver or if they have not forgiven. Even now you can forgive.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:51.280
See for yourself - bend your head. See for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:06.860
Now put the left hand towards Me - bend your head, without bending you won't know. Left hand towards Me. Now bend your head as, and see for yourself

01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:13.620
if there is a cool or a hot breeze. Sometimes it is very close, sometimes it's very far away like a jet.

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:20.660
See now for yourself, there's a cool or a warm or a hot air coming out of your own head. You have to certify

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:23.940
[UNCLEAR - BEND NOW?], if it is there, just see it.

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:34.000
Now please put your right hand again, once again. Bend your head and see for yourself

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:49.640
with the left hand. Now, not to touch your head, little away, little away.

01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:03.020
Now raise both the hands towards the sky, like this. Here, straight, push back your head

01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:06.320
and ask a question three times,

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:13.140
"Mother, is this the All- Pervading power of God's love?"

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:20.320
or you can ask another question three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:27.320
or another question three times, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya, Mother, is this the Brahma Chaitanya?"

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:32.140
Ask any one of these questions, three times, in your heart.

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.620
Push back your head towards the sky.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:47.780
Now bring it down.

01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:54.140
First you'll feel very relaxed. Now put your hands like this.

01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:02.220
Those who have felt cool or warm or a hot breeze on their fingers or on their hands

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:07.580
or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:18.500
So beautiful! I bow to you all, your saintliness. May God bless you!

01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:24.300
Please continue with it. All of you have got it in Canberra - it's remarkable!

01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:31.800
May God bless you! But all of you should come. It's not that so many get realization and four five people come in.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:39.140
It's a very slow progress. You are so deep and you must know your depth. Please remember

01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:42.400
that all of you have to come.

01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:51.260
It's little late but I don't mind meeting you, if you have time - you can come, I would like to meet you all. [UNCLEAR]
