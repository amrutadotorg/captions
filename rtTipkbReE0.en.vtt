WEBVTT

00:08.543 --> 00:16.637
Today is a special day, as you know;
we are worshipping the Goddess

00:17.079 --> 00:23.619
who came on this earth
nine times before,

00:24.102 --> 00:27.882
to kill all the demons
and all the negativity,

00:28.087 --> 00:36.247
and relieve all the
bhaktas to worship.

00:37.324 --> 00:43.264
All Her work has already
been described.

00:44.179 --> 00:52.699
Despite that they find
new type of devils,

00:54.252 --> 01:00.572
new type of negative people
have come back.

01:03.109 --> 01:08.039
Perhaps it had to be.

01:19.964 --> 01:25.254
This had to be, maybe,
after all it’s Kali Yuga.

01:25.914 --> 01:34.309
And the drama of Kali Yuga would not be
performed unless and until they are there.

01:37.247 --> 01:41.357
So to complete
this drama they came.

01:42.936 --> 01:55.336
But this time, it’s going to be
a very different type of war.

01:57.479 --> 02:02.649
It’s going to be the war
of the peaceful people.

02:04.201 --> 02:13.314
And the peaceful people are the most successful people

02:13.850 --> 02:20.000
in every walk of life, even in the war.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.550
It did not work out before.

02:24.142 --> 02:28.732
They say that when
Genghis Khan came,

02:29.406 --> 02:37.116
he went to a very big monastery
of Buddhists near Gaya

02:37.821 --> 02:40.331
and killed all of them.

02:40.671 --> 02:44.061
There were about thirty
thousand of Buddhists there

02:44.569 --> 02:49.859
and they didn’t say a word,
and they were all killed.

02:51.071 --> 02:55.111
So people started
disbelieving in Buddhism.

02:55.674 --> 03:01.114
They said, “What kind of a Buddhism
is here? Why didn’t Buddha save them?”

03:01.959 --> 03:06.159
That’s human style of thinking.

03:06.857 --> 03:12.401
"Buddha should have saved these thirty
thousand people who were peaceful,

03:13.114 --> 03:21.024
who were resisting in a manner
that was no resistance,

03:22.140 --> 03:26.960
and so they were all killed by this
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan."

03:27.509 --> 03:35.178
But you’ll be surprised, in this Kali Yuga,
this Genghis Khan has been praised by many authors.

03:35.417 --> 03:38.387
And there are books written about him.

03:38.804 --> 03:43.534
He was not a Muslim but
some sort of a crackpot.

03:44.264 --> 03:49.554
He finished off many mosques,

03:50.000 --> 03:57.080
he destroyed many
beautiful buildings

03:57.507 --> 04:03.017
and also, he came to India
and ruled there for a short time.

04:03.699 --> 04:06.519
All that’s a history.

04:07.356 --> 04:26.707
In the same way, there have been wars
between Christians and non-Christians,

04:28.062 --> 04:32.192
between Muslims
and non-Muslims.

04:32.969 --> 04:43.451
All kinds of wars we have heard of
where only the faithful got lost,

04:43.990 --> 04:46.350
the real people got lost.

04:46.921 --> 04:55.325
The one who worshipped
God with full faith got lost.

04:56.959 --> 04:59.839
So, many people become atheist

05:00.879 --> 05:06.766
and they said, “There is nothing like God,
nothing like his divine Power.

05:07.132 --> 05:13.423
It never existed. We were stupid,
we were foolish to follow all this".

05:13.889 --> 05:19.751
And those who were in charge of religion
took full advantage of that

05:19.751 --> 05:25.390
and said that, "These people
were sinful people,

05:25.390 --> 05:29.870
these people were not godly people,

05:30.609 --> 05:36.069
and that’s how they were killed by
us and we were victorious".

05:38.549 --> 05:43.999
The idea of victory they had
that they have been successful

05:44.393 --> 05:48.823
"and so many people have
been butchered by us".

05:53.034 --> 05:56.634
So we come to Kali Yuga,

05:57.684 --> 06:04.924
and in Kali Yuga, same thing
has started in a subtler way;

06:05.554 --> 06:08.874
in a different way
it has started that

06:08.874 --> 06:18.984
there’s a big war going on
between the people who are anti-God,

06:19.757 --> 06:25.227
and who are using God
for their own purpose.

06:25.837 --> 06:30.717
Very dishonest, very corrupt,
very cruel people.

06:31.022 --> 06:36.652
And they are using
the flag of God,

06:37.104 --> 06:43.594
that banner which they
have no right to use.

06:43.987 --> 06:51.133
Then there are Sahaja Yogis
who have got their Realization,

06:51.133 --> 06:55.822


06:56.339 --> 07:04.939
Now the difference in the previous
wars and this war is very different.

07:07.251 --> 07:15.970
In those wars, you see, all those
who were supposed to be victorious

07:16.496 --> 07:26.766
- this was, after all, the nine battles of the Divine Mother -

07:27.661 --> 07:33.375
– the negativity that came up
and which became successful

07:33.375 --> 07:41.022
started feeling very confident that,
"We have achieved what we wanted".

07:42.589 --> 07:51.990
But in Kali Yuga,
in the light of Kali Yuga,

07:51.990 --> 08:01.487
all those historical victories
are regarded as shameful things,

08:02.374 --> 08:08.504
as something very
aggressive and nonsensical.

08:10.624 --> 08:14.174
This is now being described everywhere.

08:14.922 --> 08:25.260
Like, the white-skinned people went to America
and killed all the rest of them there.

08:26.279 --> 08:31.749
– now that is coming into light.

08:32.844 --> 08:40.544
All these people who thought
themselves to be victorious:

08:40.824 --> 08:44.997
their children, their grandchildren,
their progeny are ashamed of them!

08:44.997 --> 08:50.627
Ashamed to call that
they were their forefathers

08:50.934 --> 08:54.184
– up till the last war.

08:55.981 --> 09:06.592
This awareness which has come is the real victory of modern times,

09:06.592 --> 09:09.740
of this Kali Yuga:

09:10.000 --> 09:16.070
that everything that was
accepted as a part of the game,

09:16.070 --> 09:22.420
as the lifestyle, you can call it,

09:22.844 --> 09:28.254
is now being challenged in
modern times, everywhere.

09:28.680 --> 09:36.160
Whatever is aggression,
whatever is oppression,

09:36.778 --> 09:44.499
whatever is cruel is
now punished also.

09:47.489 --> 09:52.556
You see, so many war
criminals must have escaped,

09:52.556 --> 09:56.346
but so many went into trials

09:56.346 --> 09:58.196
– never happened before.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.842
Nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

10:02.279 --> 10:04.969
Now in a very subtle way

10:05.477 --> 10:09.887
all these aggressive people
are getting now afraid

10:10.000 --> 10:20.090
that they will be questioned,
and they may be tortured.

10:21.224 --> 10:23.520
It started I don’t know where,

10:23.520 --> 10:27.140
but definitely at the beginning
of the Kali Yuga.

10:27.374 --> 10:33.891
If you remember in this country was
a great aggressive man called Mussolini,

10:34.187 --> 10:37.337
and ultimately he was hanged.

10:38.194 --> 10:40.894
In Germany there was
a very powerful man

10:41.432 --> 10:44.242
called Hitler, and Himmler
and all this.

10:44.682 --> 10:47.072
God knows what
happened to them

10:47.427 --> 10:50.597
– even the Germans don’t
want to take his name,

10:50.847 --> 10:53.627
they’re all ashamed of him.

10:54.309 --> 10:57.759
Then we had somebody
say in England,

10:57.759 --> 11:00.919
Warren Hastings who
came to India

11:01.192 --> 11:03.012
– he was put to jail.

11:03.332 --> 11:07.002
This was never done before.

11:07.599 --> 11:13.859
If Napoleon aggressed people, he
thought he was very victorious;

11:14.292 --> 11:20.402
but he could not continue
with it, he had to face it.

11:21.624 --> 11:28.314
You see, anybody who has been aggressive,

11:28.732 --> 11:38.122
who has been dominating,
who has been very cruel, demonic,

11:39.127 --> 11:43.697
has been taken to task
mostly in his lifetime.

11:44.696 --> 11:51.646
Now, if not in his lifetime,

11:51.934 --> 11:56.074
afterwards he was maligned

11:56.074 --> 12:00.332
and he doesn’t have a name
like a hero or anything.

12:00.332 --> 12:04.637
People don’t want
to erect their statues.

12:05.571 --> 12:09.021
So the awareness has come
in the mind of the people.

12:09.454 --> 12:14.694
Like a person like Stalin who
ruled Russia once upon a time,

12:15.052 --> 12:19.242
today you can’t see even
one statue of Stalin.

12:19.552 --> 12:22.672
These are modern times.

12:23.769 --> 12:27.299
See the power
of modern times!

12:27.699 --> 12:30.109
And that is frightening
to those people

12:30.109 --> 12:34.809
who think they can get along
with whatever they are doing.

12:35.454 --> 12:41.504
It is going to be very
soon understood by them

12:42.262 --> 12:49.452
that they have to stop all this
nonsense, otherwise they will suffer.

12:49.937 --> 12:53.447
It’s not those whom
they are dominating

12:53.792 --> 12:57.142
but those who are
dominating will suffer.

12:57.427 --> 13:01.180
They will suffer physically,
they will suffer mentally,

13:01.490 --> 13:03.080
they will suffer emotionally,

13:03.340 --> 13:09.420
and also their fame
will be in the mud.

13:09.749 --> 13:18.669
So today’s victory of the
power of the Divine Mother

13:19.287 --> 13:25.400
is doing one very great
work, is to expose;

13:26.259 --> 13:33.095
and this exposure will be condemning publicly

13:33.095 --> 13:36.760
those people who are doing wrong.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.899
If you see from that point of view,

13:41.312 --> 13:47.302
you will understand how
we are victorious now.

13:48.197 --> 13:52.728
Many of you felt very sad
that I didn’t get the award [Peace Nobel Price].

13:52.728 --> 13:55.408
This award makes no
difference to Me,

13:55.747 --> 13:58.247
and to you also, I must tell you;

13:58.247 --> 14:02.517
because you have come without
I having any award,

14:02.802 --> 14:06.552
and many will come without
having any award as such.

14:07.257 --> 14:12.557
But this time, for the
first time, if you notice

14:12.802 --> 14:16.742
the people who got award
are condemned.

14:17.214 --> 14:23.114
Even now they are writing against it,
even now they are criticizing.

14:23.781 --> 14:28.681
So those who have been, they
thought they were very smart,

14:29.019 --> 14:31.660
but the smartness is out now

14:31.660 --> 14:33.804
and I don’t know
how long will it go on;

14:33.804 --> 14:38.980
because even today if you use, open a newspaper
you find something about it,

14:38.980 --> 14:42.340
that how stupidly
they have done it

14:42.340 --> 14:45.690
– they can’t understand what was
the reason they have done it.

14:46.192 --> 14:49.332
Not only the people who
selected are criticized,

14:49.332 --> 14:53.902
but very much more
the people who are selected.

14:55.649 --> 15:02.250
Now, as being Sahaja Yogis,
we have to know what is the difference

15:02.250 --> 15:10.940
between the consciousness at that
time and awareness at this time.

15:13.236 --> 15:16.256
That time it was necessary
to kill those demons, finish them,

15:17.470 --> 15:21.420
but they are back
again on the stage.

15:25.790 --> 15:29.930
Now at this time when
it is Kali Yuga

15:30.830 --> 15:33.730
they are exposed,

15:35.830 --> 15:38.270
they are condemned,

15:38.570 --> 15:44.690
they are put in the jail, they
are now punished publicly.

15:45.380 --> 15:49.360
So the collective awareness

15:50.360 --> 15:56.310
has got such a great victory
I think, over these people

15:56.580 --> 15:59.230
whom so many came,
killed and died

15:59.530 --> 16:01.790
without getting any
punishment out of it,

16:02.030 --> 16:06.750
without getting any
defamation out of it.

16:07.730 --> 16:10.510
Now let us see what
is consciousness

16:10.820 --> 16:14.860
and what is awareness.

16:26.190 --> 16:31.290
It is a subtle subject which
I think you all can understand.

16:33.510 --> 16:36.310
Consciousness is that

16:36.660 --> 16:40.460
when you are made conscious,
you become conscious about it.

16:40.830 --> 16:44.330
Like I have My
hand here all right,

16:44.330 --> 16:49.920
but normally I am not conscious
of it that I have a hand.

16:52.629 --> 16:57.259
If a man is sleeping, he is
not conscious that he’s sleeping.

16:57.927 --> 17:02.447
When you tell Me “You have
a hand” I become conscious;

17:03.807 --> 17:07.907
or something pricks Me,
then I become conscious

17:08.850 --> 17:12.520
– otherwise I am
unconscious about it.

17:14.390 --> 17:21.640
I am absolutely unconscious about
My eyes, I am seeing everything;

17:22.200 --> 17:28.730
but supposing I become
blind, I can’t see:

17:29.070 --> 17:33.490
then I become conscious
of My eyes,

17:33.750 --> 17:38.580
that I have got My eyes through
which now I cannot see.

17:39.124 --> 17:46.334
So once you say there is this
hand, the consciousness is there.

17:46.842 --> 17:50.512
This we can say is the
knowledge about the hand,

17:50.512 --> 17:53.672
that you get knowledge
about that.

17:55.347 --> 17:57.147
But once

17:58.697 --> 18:03.557
you are not conscious of the hand,
that knowledge is disappeared.

18:06.079 --> 18:10.559
So to say there is ignorance
or there is knowledge,

18:10.559 --> 18:14.529
both things are just the same.

18:15.482 --> 18:23.412
You are not conscious of your hand
so you are quite ignorant about it.

18:23.997 --> 18:26.667
Now supposing somebody says,

18:27.490 --> 18:30.810
“Your hands are very beautiful”.

18:31.760 --> 18:36.200
Somebody remarks like that then
I become conscious of my hand

18:36.500 --> 18:42.220
which is beautiful; otherwise
I never knew they were beautiful.

18:44.770 --> 18:49.780
So normally all human beings
live at that level,

18:50.340 --> 18:52.890
that somebody has to tell you.

18:53.180 --> 18:56.160
Now somebody said, "You
are wearing a very nice sari".

18:56.440 --> 19:02.750
All right. Then I look at it, "Yes,
it’s very nice, I never knew".

19:05.129 --> 19:09.509
So somebody has to tell you,
then you become conscious;

19:10.902 --> 19:14.202
otherwise you are not.

19:16.407 --> 19:21.347
So we all human beings
at that level are like that.

19:22.482 --> 19:26.102
Now, what is awareness?

19:27.042 --> 19:29.142
– that’s a different thing.

19:30.484 --> 19:34.744
That means if I see

19:35.447 --> 19:40.057
somebody is attacking Me
I put My hand like this.

19:40.457 --> 19:43.807
That means I’m
aware I have a hand.

19:44.279 --> 19:48.990
I’m not conscious but I’m aware that I have
a hand, I have to use it.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.664
Like here, in Italy, you
go on using your hands

19:51.664 --> 19:54.654
bringing them up all
the time like this.

19:56.042 --> 20:00.332
That means you know you
are aware that you have got hands,

20:00.737 --> 20:03.487
that you have to use
them for expressing

20:03.487 --> 20:07.317
something more sort
of emphatically.

20:10.010 --> 20:17.070
So we are sort of also
aware of our body,

20:17.430 --> 20:20.200
we are aware of others,

20:22.040 --> 20:24.430
we know about others,

20:24.960 --> 20:28.210
we know what sort of
a person another one is

20:28.610 --> 20:33.840
– up till you are Self-realized.

20:36.340 --> 20:39.230
After Self-realization what happens?

20:39.790 --> 20:41.910
It’s very interesting.

20:43.740 --> 20:49.950
After Self-realization you go
beyond both these things,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.090
consciousness and awareness,

20:55.147 --> 21:00.557
because you go beyond thought.

21:02.452 --> 21:05.782
“You have gone beyond
thought” means what?

21:06.252 --> 21:14.474
Anger, all kinds of ideas, all kinds of aggression,

21:14.474 --> 21:19.214
everything is maneuvered

21:19.214 --> 21:23.930
or worked through your mind.

21:24.474 --> 21:30.074
So if your mind is lost,
what will you do?

21:31.809 --> 21:35.149
There’s no mind anymore.

21:36.134 --> 21:39.954
You exist with reality,

21:41.350 --> 21:45.560
so there is no mind to communicate.

21:46.330 --> 21:49.090
We call it 'thoughtlessly aware'.

21:49.420 --> 21:51.150
Means what?

21:51.480 --> 21:53.880
We have conquered
all our enemies by

21:54.140 --> 21:58.160
giving up one enemy
that was our mind.

21:58.160 --> 22:01.250
There’s no mind to suggest,

22:01.602 --> 22:04.652
there’s no mind to tell you,

22:05.302 --> 22:09.882
so once there is no
mind you are lost.

22:11.184 --> 22:13.344
Now it is being said that you ask

22:13.344 --> 22:16.554
a question to yourself,
“Who am I?”

22:18.634 --> 22:21.764
As soon as you ask this question
you become thoughtless,

22:22.490 --> 22:24.780
so you get lost.

22:25.710 --> 22:29.030
You cannot answer this question.

22:29.754 --> 22:34.184
Otherwise you might say, “I am
a woman, I am this, I am that”;

22:34.184 --> 22:41.764
“I am a bishop or I am a pope,
I am this, I am that.”

22:43.379 --> 22:48.400
But once you are a Realized soul,
who will tell  you who you are?

22:48.400 --> 22:52.470
Because the one which tells
you is the mind which doesn’t exist

22:52.470 --> 22:54.290
- no thought

22:56.162 --> 23:01.662
– means you get dissolved
into your Self.

23:03.981 --> 23:06.541
This is what is reality.

23:09.312 --> 23:15.222
But you are aware also;
now that’s another point.

23:19.800 --> 23:24.440
If you ask yourself a question
you are not there,

23:26.080 --> 23:27.890
but you are aware.

23:28.660 --> 23:30.970
If your Nabhi is catching
you immediately you know

23:31.210 --> 23:34.370
“My Nabhi is catching,
I have got liver.”

23:35.700 --> 23:37.150
Don’t have to ask questions.

23:37.430 --> 23:39.140
Or somebody is standing near you,

23:39.390 --> 23:43.650
his left Swadisthana
– “Oh my God, it is this one!”

23:47.670 --> 23:49.790
If somebody is very angry
and hot tempered,

23:50.100 --> 23:52.400
immediately you’ll feel such
heat from that person,

23:52.660 --> 23:56.190
you’ll say, “Oh baba,
I’ll run away from this man.”

23:56.190 --> 23:59.530
So this is a new

24:03.197 --> 24:06.527
realm you have entered into reality,

24:07.400 --> 24:11.320
which you are never aware of before.

24:12.109 --> 24:17.969
Now supposing there’s a very
bad man standing near you.

24:19.210 --> 24:23.650
He might be a thief, he might
be a murderer, anything

24:23.950 --> 24:27.010
– you will not be even
conscious of it

24:27.310 --> 24:30.640
leave alone aware, normally.

24:30.960 --> 24:35.080
But once you are a realized soul,

24:36.310 --> 24:42.610
you become aware of the whole.

24:42.950 --> 24:45.130
That is reality.

24:45.460 --> 24:50.860
What are the problems,
in the collective?

24:51.812 --> 24:55.262
You become aware of the collective.

24:55.832 --> 24:58.762
You become aware of the
problems of the whole world.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.447
Now, this awareness is
very different.

25:03.446 --> 25:07.706
The first awareness as
I told you is like this,

25:08.169 --> 25:13.059
that if somebody tells you
you are this and this,

25:13.447 --> 25:16.707
you become aware of it.

25:18.737 --> 25:22.447
In this, nobody has to tell you;

25:24.160 --> 25:27.160
it’s just there.

25:31.120 --> 25:35.560
You are there, you know what it is.

25:37.390 --> 25:45.440
And this is what you have
achieved in these modern times,

25:46.120 --> 25:49.710
which is the blessing
of the modern times also,

25:50.130 --> 25:55.090
that we know now who we are.

25:55.729 --> 26:00.959
You always say, “We are the pure
Spirit,” yesterday also I heard it.

26:01.244 --> 26:03.194
Are you sure?

26:03.950 --> 26:07.730
What makes you believe that,

26:08.497 --> 26:12.327
that you are the pure Spirit?

26:13.344 --> 26:16.884
I mean, you haven’t seen
your Spirit, have you?

26:17.494 --> 26:20.594
You haven’t seen yourself
what you are.

26:21.427 --> 26:24.367
Then how do you say you
are the pure Spirit?

26:24.877 --> 26:31.277
It’s just you are saying
something because I say so.

26:33.596 --> 26:39.516
But you are the pure Spirit,
because whatever the description

26:39.516 --> 26:41.986
of the pure Spirit is given

26:42.769 --> 26:46.959
that it is aware

26:48.550 --> 26:54.050
of the divine Power.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.970
It is aware of the Divine Power,

26:59.650 --> 27:03.970
and that is how you
are the pure Spirit;

27:04.510 --> 27:07.800
because only
through pure Spirit

27:08.120 --> 27:10.780
as your personality

27:11.070 --> 27:18.780
you can be aware of this
All-pervading Power.

27:19.950 --> 27:27.100
This is written in all the 'shastras',
in all the scriptures, everywhere.

27:27.850 --> 27:30.950
And what do you know
about yourself?

27:32.510 --> 27:39.780
– that you are the Spirit, because
you know about your own chakras,

27:39.780 --> 27:43.110
you know about your own nadis.

27:43.834 --> 27:49.334
Now, what has happened is that
you are separated from your self

27:49.334 --> 27:53.444
and you can see your self.

27:54.754 --> 27:58.934
You see yourself very clearly,

28:01.209 --> 28:10.439
and you start seeing yourself as the
present and the past and the future.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.690
“In the past what I was”
– you see, you’re shocked now

28:15.970 --> 28:18.490
“my goodness, I was like this.”

28:18.880 --> 28:22.920
You see it through this
present state,

28:23.200 --> 28:26.330
in the present state you see.

28:26.912 --> 28:33.412
Then you start forgetting it,
“Forget the past, forget the past.”

28:36.692 --> 28:39.952
Then still you have the future;

28:40.449 --> 28:46.229
then you start thinking
about the future.

28:47.207 --> 28:53.362
First future they think about their
own children, their wives - Sahaja Yogis also.

28:53.887 --> 29:00.607
“What will happen to my children?
What will happen to my wife?”

29:01.862 --> 29:06.692
Then they think, “What will
happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

29:07.574 --> 29:11.414
Then they think, “What
will happen to Mataji?”

29:12.844 --> 29:17.144
Also they think, “What will
happen to this world?”

29:18.358 --> 29:26.566
Because your awareness
has expanded,

29:28.299 --> 29:32.699
you are not in the limited
sphere now anymore.

29:34.487 --> 29:37.327
You can think of your children,
you can think of your wife,

29:37.327 --> 29:40.807
also you can think
of the whole world

29:41.834 --> 29:46.824
and all the problems of
the world you think about.

29:48.919 --> 29:52.419
So you have reached
that state, all right;

29:52.902 --> 29:56.052
up to that state we are.

29:56.994 --> 29:59.884
Now what is the thing

30:02.530 --> 30:08.220
that covers up all this
or gives you solutions,

30:08.490 --> 30:12.870
say, for your children, for your
family, your wife, everyone

30:13.130 --> 30:15.560
– what is the solution?

30:17.030 --> 30:22.450
Your Mother believes in giving
solutions, not only the problems

30:23.640 --> 30:27.130
Because these days
there are not problems

30:27.460 --> 30:31.200
that existed in the Navaratri.

30:32.920 --> 30:35.200
They no more exist,

30:35.510 --> 30:42.080
that you can take a sword
in your hand and go and

30:42.360 --> 30:44.900
kill someone; no, it doesn’t,

30:45.820 --> 30:49.480
it’s not possible – cut what?

30:50.750 --> 30:55.760
So the today’s problem
as they are, as we see

30:57.500 --> 31:01.430
– within us we see the problems,

31:01.680 --> 31:06.450
we are aware of it and we
want to do something about it.

31:07.370 --> 31:10.740
Whether we are in the past,
present or future,

31:11.020 --> 31:13.770
we see the problem.

31:17.720 --> 31:21.030
So now what is the solution?

31:22.440 --> 31:30.510
We have no weapons,
nothing to fight.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.420
We don’t know also,
so many do not

31:34.700 --> 31:38.340
know even how to hold
a sword in the hand,

31:38.920 --> 31:42.100
and so many don’t
even want to hold it;

31:43.380 --> 31:46.220
because they are so
much in compassion,

31:46.520 --> 31:49.990
in the ocean of compassion
enjoying themselves nicely.

31:51.290 --> 31:54.780
They are enjoying their own
compassion and compassion of others,

31:55.070 --> 31:57.660
compassion of their Mother.

31:58.270 --> 32:01.790
But then how to solve the problem?

32:06.990 --> 32:09.590
The problem can be solved

32:09.820 --> 32:15.200
if you become very
powerful yourself within.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.380
Where is your attention?

32:25.010 --> 32:27.900
You have to move inward.

32:28.350 --> 32:30.730
Where is your attention?

32:32.270 --> 32:36.180
You have to become very powerful.

32:37.210 --> 32:41.980
I have done My job, I have
given you realization.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.720
You have grown so much,
I have explained to you,

32:46.970 --> 32:49.770
I’ve told you everything
– it’s done.

32:50.280 --> 32:54.030
I have given you lots of love,

32:54.290 --> 32:58.870
ocean of love, I should say,
as you call it, whatever it is.

33:00.829 --> 33:04.429
But now you have to
nourish yourself.

33:05.560 --> 33:10.080
You have to become
powerful within yourself.

33:12.332 --> 33:16.412
So what is the way you
can become powerful?

33:21.344 --> 33:23.844
First, you must believe

33:24.780 --> 33:29.500
that you have transcended
your human personality

33:29.780 --> 33:35.310
and you have now become
a super-human being.

33:40.089 --> 33:44.289
First of all, this must come in you.

33:45.098 --> 33:48.214
This is what we call as faith.

33:48.879 --> 33:53.950
This faith is not false
faith, is not blind faith

33:54.240 --> 34:00.110
that you believe into
something, but it’s a fact.

34:01.766 --> 34:05.020
I have a hundred times,
I have told you

34:05.330 --> 34:10.420
that you have first of all
faith in your ascent

34:10.690 --> 34:14.680
in your position as Sahaja Yogis.

34:17.158 --> 34:23.692
For this meditation is
very important, very important.

34:23.954 --> 34:29.594
Without meditation you cannot
have full faith in yourself,

34:30.831 --> 34:38.038
because you can’t know yourself
by saying, “Who am I?” You cannot.

34:39.489 --> 34:45.809
You try now. Ask a question within,
“Who am I?” You’ll be lost.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.460
So what should be the faith then?

34:55.700 --> 35:00.280
Because when you ask the question
“Who am I?” you are lost.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.010
So we reach a stage
where I have to tell you

35:11.290 --> 35:18.630
that faith is not mental, it is
not emotional, it is not physical,

35:18.990 --> 35:25.380
but it is a state of your own being

35:26.140 --> 35:30.860
which we can call as
a spiritual state.

35:35.690 --> 35:38.980
In the spiritual state

35:41.610 --> 35:47.230
nothing can disturb you,

35:49.430 --> 35:52.680
nothing can overpower you,

35:53.500 --> 35:56.810
nothing can dominate you;

35:59.000 --> 36:02.400
because that state if you have,

36:02.760 --> 36:09.240
that means you are part
and parcel of reality.

36:10.500 --> 36:18.380
Then you are a honored member
of the God’s kingdom.

36:20.440 --> 36:29.270
Then you are the most
revered personality.

36:30.860 --> 36:34.070
Then you are like a deity.

36:35.390 --> 36:38.630
Then you are like a Gana.

36:40.270 --> 36:44.990
In that state when you are
– it’s a state, again I say,

36:45.700 --> 36:49.350
beyond the human state

36:51.410 --> 36:56.040
– you are extremely powerful.

37:02.590 --> 37:06.240
There’s a story about
Nizamuddin – the great Auliya,

37:06.530 --> 37:09.440
great Sufi in India.

37:09.880 --> 37:12.630
There was a horrible king

37:12.930 --> 37:16.240
I think what Shah he called himself;

37:16.870 --> 37:22.100
and he would not go and bow
to him. So he was very angry.

37:22.380 --> 37:26.020
He said, “I can only bow
to God and to nobody else.”

37:27.620 --> 37:31.610
This Shah said, “If you don’t come
and bow to me tomorrow,

37:31.860 --> 37:35.110
I will cut your throat.”

37:35.840 --> 37:40.410
And that night, the throat
of this king was cut.

37:41.390 --> 37:45.820
It’s a story, but it’s a real story.

37:47.730 --> 37:53.160
Somebody came and cut his throat
– it was not Nizamuddin Sahib.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.570
He would not do that.

37:59.090 --> 38:03.070
So that state if you reach,

38:04.500 --> 38:10.290
what we call is
the state of shraddha,

38:10.600 --> 38:17.900
state of shraddha

38:18.220 --> 38:24.650
which is enlightened,
enlightened faith.

38:26.650 --> 38:34.120
It’s a new type of mechanism;

38:36.790 --> 38:44.190
that is, you become part
and parcel of the whole.

38:45.340 --> 38:48.930
That means the moon, the star- see

38:49.960 --> 38:54.530
I tell you, I never told the sun that
it should be there for the pujas -

38:54.820 --> 38:57.450
last time, this time - I never tell him.

38:57.760 --> 39:02.100
There’s no need to tell,
it’s all done.

39:04.560 --> 39:08.150
I don’t tell all these vibrations

39:08.450 --> 39:14.430
to make a cross or to show these,
all these miraculous photographs.

39:14.690 --> 39:18.230
I don´t tell them, there´s no need to tell.

39:21.310 --> 39:25.260
They just do it by themselves.
I am sometimes surprised

39:25.590 --> 39:28.380
how ingenious methods
they have of their own,

39:28.640 --> 39:32.040
how they manage things
– I am myself surprised.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.980
I didn’t tell them that
these two persons

39:36.260 --> 39:38.280
who were selected by this award

39:38.530 --> 39:42.440
should be so condemned
by every newspaper.

39:42.830 --> 39:46.140
It all works automatically,

39:49.650 --> 39:52.370
it just works.

39:52.730 --> 39:58.610
Only thing if I have anything is
just complete, complete faith

39:58.880 --> 40:01.730
that I am at that state,

40:02.320 --> 40:07.020
and that’s why there is
complete patience, 'saburi',

40:07.610 --> 40:10.070
complete patience.

40:15.310 --> 40:19.120
And that is what we have to learn.

40:20.240 --> 40:26.330
It will all happen in any case
because you are all at that state.

40:27.010 --> 40:30.470
Only meditation is important,
very important;

40:30.750 --> 40:33.840
for Me not, but for you all.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.680
If you all can meditate now,

40:38.300 --> 40:45.480
just for ten minutes also every day,

40:46.400 --> 40:48.860
it will help you a lot.

40:49.910 --> 40:56.540
Now, why do we have all these
statues and, I mean the Mother

40:57.110 --> 41:01.990
and the Hanumana
and Ganesha, Christ?

41:02.690 --> 41:05.830
Because to begin with,
human beings cannot

41:05.830 --> 41:10.710
understand anything which
does not have a form.

41:12.305 --> 41:17.615
They cannot go deeper unless
and until there’s a form.

41:18.252 --> 41:21.240
But they went to another
limit of using any stone,

41:21.240 --> 41:25.570
anything, as God and all that.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.480
But now you have discretion:

41:29.850 --> 41:32.340
you know what is to be worshipped,

41:32.630 --> 41:41.410
what is to be treated as a higher
personality – that you know.

41:41.930 --> 41:46.570
But before that they would
worship all kinds of people,

41:46.820 --> 41:51.040
like now people worship pope,
you know that very well.

41:52.230 --> 41:53.910
But now what to do?

41:54.460 --> 41:57.460
They are not only blind,

41:57.800 --> 42:03.220
they are not only unaware, but
they are also not conscious of it.

42:04.410 --> 42:08.890
They are all at such a level
that you cannot tell them.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.920
So you are a new type
of people I should say,

42:13.210 --> 42:17.940
who have tried to fight
it out, to struggle out,

42:18.220 --> 42:22.830
to know about the absolute truth.

42:24.550 --> 42:29.300
Unless and until you know
the absolute truth,

42:30.320 --> 42:32.260
you are nowhere;

42:32.840 --> 42:38.640
you have no discretion, you have no
understanding, you have no wisdom.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.600
But once you know the absolute truth,

42:42.940 --> 42:48.290
then you should not by any chance

42:49.200 --> 42:52.150
be halfway this and halfway that.

42:52.850 --> 42:59.780
That’s a very dangerous
state of affairs.

43:00.140 --> 43:07.530
Say a seed is sprouted, it is
neither a seed nor a tree.

43:10.220 --> 43:14.110
If it doesn’t grow it is useless.

43:14.550 --> 43:17.810
That’s happens to your
awareness – I am again talking

43:18.130 --> 43:21.410
of your consciousness, awareness

43:24.960 --> 43:30.750
– and then you are neither
here nor there.

43:31.360 --> 43:38.100
There are many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga perhaps, maybe

43:38.850 --> 43:42.000
to find some peace.

43:42.650 --> 43:44.870
But I get letters:

43:45.120 --> 43:49.540
“My father is sick, my mother is
sick, my sister is sick.”

43:49.850 --> 43:54.650
Then otherwise, “My husband is fighting
with me, I am seeking a divorce.”

43:55.010 --> 43:57.140
Or thirdly, “I’ve lost all my money,

43:57.380 --> 44:00.020
I must have some money.”

44:00.370 --> 44:02.920
Fourthly, “I am a great artist but I,

44:03.160 --> 44:05.910
my art is not selling.”

44:06.190 --> 44:11.240
All these stupid problems
they bring for Me.

44:11.570 --> 44:16.730
Hah – “My children are no good,
they are troublesome.”

44:17.020 --> 44:18.950
Then, “My wife is fighting with me,

44:19.210 --> 44:21.890
my mother is fighting with
me, brother is fighting.”

44:22.130 --> 44:26.710
But I said, “What sort
of Sahaja yogis these are?”

44:30.820 --> 44:36.300
The state of being one
with the reality

44:39.120 --> 44:45.060
means that the whole
of reality is at your feet,

44:46.610 --> 44:49.260
whole of it works for you;

44:50.220 --> 44:55.220
and once you even
get a glimpse of that state

44:55.500 --> 45:02.720
I tell you, you become so much
peaceful within yourself.

45:08.090 --> 45:11.890
If you say, “I am the king,
I am the king,”

45:12.340 --> 45:15.430
if you say, “I am the beggar,
I am the beggar,”

45:15.750 --> 45:18.890
what difference does it
make to that state

45:19.180 --> 45:24.370
which is like a purest of pure gold,

45:24.830 --> 45:28.480
which cannot be tarnished?

45:31.770 --> 45:35.590
Such a state of mind
we have to develop.

45:37.020 --> 45:40.840
It’s a more a challenge to us.

45:41.580 --> 45:44.460
We are Sahaja yogis, all right.

45:45.100 --> 45:48.050
We have got realization, all right.

45:48.680 --> 45:51.800
We can sing very well, all right.

45:52.160 --> 45:55.590
We have achieved good
positions, all right.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.490
We are nicely married, all right.

46:00.060 --> 46:02.960
We’ve got nice children,
we have got everything,

46:03.230 --> 46:05.450
we have got jobs, this that.

46:05.770 --> 46:12.650
Now, suddenly one negative force
comes in to trouble you – so what?

46:16.380 --> 46:18.380
So what?

46:21.520 --> 46:26.120
Otherwise how will you
know what you are?

46:27.610 --> 46:31.980
If there is no darkness, how will
you know you are the light?

46:34.220 --> 46:44.160
It’s a challenge to your own
state, at what state you are.

46:45.120 --> 46:50.580
The word “state” is not so
explanatory. In Sanskrit is swarupa,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.200
swarupa

46:56.130 --> 47:03.040
– “swa” is yourself
and “rupa” is form or state.

47:04.760 --> 47:10.800
That state is possible
for all of you

47:12.950 --> 47:17.780
by saying “Not this, not this,
not this, not this.”

47:20.720 --> 47:27.950
As it is, your mind has reached
that state that there is no mind

47:28.280 --> 47:30.620
– you can do that.

47:31.280 --> 47:37.550
But you have to develop
a kind of a personality

47:38.000 --> 47:41.780
that realizes what you are.

47:44.990 --> 47:48.730
But in that realization

47:50.920 --> 47:53.830
you are just aware of it,

47:54.120 --> 47:56.100
not conscious of it.

47:56.420 --> 47:59.100
I´ll, for example, I'll tell you.

48:00.290 --> 48:04.180
I am aware that I am Adi Shakti
– I am aware, I know.

48:04.540 --> 48:09.910
But when you say “Jai Shri Mataji”
I also say “Jai Shri Mataji,”

48:10.200 --> 48:14.710
forgetting that I am the
one you are talking about.

48:17.560 --> 48:22.980
This is actually,
should be the state:

48:24.170 --> 48:27.820
that you are aware, yes, you
are aware in the sense, in the

48:28.090 --> 48:31.590
- I don’t know how to say
- but I am aware I am that.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.250
If you ask Me, “Mother,
are You Adi Shakti?”

48:34.510 --> 48:41.170
I said, “Yes, I am” - because
I know that, that I am.

48:41.580 --> 48:44.890
But when you say
“Jai Shri Mataji” I forget that

48:45.140 --> 48:50.180
I am Adi Shakti and I also say
“Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

48:53.650 --> 48:59.020
I forget, I have to tell you,
“No, no, you can't say it”.

49:00.870 --> 49:02.160
It’s very interesting.

49:02.470 --> 49:06.210
Now, you make Me sit
here like a queen

49:06.530 --> 49:09.310
and give Me a presents,
this thing, that thing;

49:09.580 --> 49:14.423
I mean, all right, that’s your idea.

49:16.937 --> 49:25.397
But to Me, you see, I am
complete in Myself, I think so.

49:27.880 --> 49:33.000
This in Hindi: “Me kahenge ki
hum apne hi andar samma gaye”

49:34.160 --> 49:39.520
"I am - got lost into Myself".

49:39.790 --> 49:43.170
All right, you do this, all right;
you should do that, all right.

49:43.450 --> 49:47.218
If you don’t do it, it’s all right.

49:48.440 --> 49:52.510
To Me it makes no difference;
it may make difference to you,

49:52.510 --> 49:54.440
but to Me it does not.

49:54.730 --> 50:00.000
Like, I´ve been saying, "Now don´t give me any presents,
don´t give me any presents", all these days.

50:00.180 --> 50:02.330
So the only argument is that,

50:02.330 --> 50:06.130
“The whole year, we give You once,
so why should You, Mother, object?

50:06.130 --> 50:07.940
because that gives us joy.”

50:08.210 --> 50:10.970
All right, if you think
it gives you joy, do it,

50:11.280 --> 50:14.650
but to Me, it doesn’t matter.

50:18.860 --> 50:22.480
Because I don’t think I am there.

50:24.960 --> 50:29.980
I am just seeing you
sitting here, all right.

50:30.250 --> 50:34.559
They are all Realized souls, all right.

50:36.240 --> 50:39.624
But I am one of you.

50:40.220 --> 50:43.160
I don’t think I am very special.

50:43.900 --> 50:48.470
But if you ask Me then I will say,
"All right, I am Adi Shakti".

50:48.740 --> 50:53.301
But I don’t think Adi Shakti
is very special also,

50:55.269 --> 50:57.569
because I’ve no mind.

50:58.260 --> 51:00.550
But otherwise, I don’t think
it’s something special.

51:00.810 --> 51:04.210
Because somebody is
something, so what?

51:05.280 --> 51:10.810
Now supposing sun is
sun, so what? He is a sun.

51:12.060 --> 51:16.263
If somebody is Adi Shakti
– so Adi Shakti, so what?

51:17.074 --> 51:23.947
But for you it is creditable
because you were not born Realized.

51:23.947 --> 51:27.573
You got your Realization.

51:27.765 --> 51:32.900
So you are special, you are great,

51:32.900 --> 51:35.350
you have achieved something.
I’ve achieved nothing;

51:35.350 --> 51:40.000
I have been like this and
I will be like this.

51:41.732 --> 51:45.640
Whether I fight the devils
or I sit before you

51:45.640 --> 51:48.710
makes no difference,
I will be like this.

51:48.710 --> 51:54.670
But for Me you are great,
because you have achieved this.

51:54.670 --> 51:58.460
Today to see you
on this Navaratri day,

51:58.690 --> 52:03.889
so many people sitting
to worship Me!

52:05.360 --> 52:08.260
So many people are here,

52:08.530 --> 52:13.370
so many Sahaja Yogis
- it’s so remarkable!

52:13.880 --> 52:16.370
It’s not My achievement, I tell you,

52:16.590 --> 52:18.420
it’s your seeking.

52:18.640 --> 52:22.556
Because I have been on this
earth many a times before

52:23.759 --> 52:25.840
that you know.

52:26.610 --> 52:28.820
But we never had like this.

52:29.100 --> 52:32.800
So many came, got crucified,
died, this, that,

52:33.040 --> 52:36.000
but I never had people of this kind.

52:38.137 --> 52:41.657
So again we come
to the same point,

52:42.600 --> 52:50.000
that we should be aware
of ourselves

52:51.630 --> 52:54.530
– complete shraddha
in yourself.

52:55.250 --> 52:58.680
If you have some shraddha
in yourself,

52:58.990 --> 53:02.238
you’ll have shraddha about Me also,

53:02.470 --> 53:06.430
because we are not different.

53:08.620 --> 53:11.390
If you believe this is water,

53:11.660 --> 53:16.129
then everywhere there is water
I believe that that is water, isn’t it?

53:16.392 --> 53:19.400
Because I know this is water,

53:20.220 --> 53:24.810
so wherever in the world there
is water, I know it is water.

53:25.707 --> 53:29.050
So if you know you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

53:29.470 --> 53:36.092
anywhere there is a Sahaja Yogi, you know there is
a Sahaja Yogi, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

53:36.092 --> 53:44.170
But as far as you are concerned
you forget how great you are,

53:44.170 --> 53:47.100
and how far you can go.

53:47.100 --> 53:50.570
I am very proud of you,
you don’t know.

53:50.570 --> 53:56.380
But because I am a humble person,

53:56.570 --> 54:00.000
I don’t know how to show off.

54:01.080 --> 54:08.607
So, I have such nice children,
so many of them, so lovable.

54:09.642 --> 54:16.351
Those bhaktas for whom She killed
so many demons and all that

54:17.370 --> 54:19.690
were not like you.

54:20.000 --> 54:26.064
You are much better, much higher,
of a much greater quality.

54:26.500 --> 54:30.700
But you must know that you are.

54:30.700 --> 54:36.480
And don’t behave like
those people who

54:36.882 --> 54:41.810
were of a very rudimentary nature.

54:42.310 --> 54:46.360
You are grown up,
you have prospered,

54:46.790 --> 54:51.086
and now the fruits we can see.

54:52.462 --> 54:56.120
I don’t know what to
do for you, really.

54:56.500 --> 55:01.422
But have faith in yourself.

55:02.420 --> 55:06.500
Then you will see how much
faith you will have in reality,

55:06.740 --> 55:10.280
that there is reality with
you at every step,

55:10.520 --> 55:13.200
every moment.

55:16.740 --> 55:18.840
No fear,

55:22.080 --> 55:25.664
no sense of achievement - nothing!

55:26.330 --> 55:29.489
Done now, finished!

55:30.000 --> 55:32.270
When there were 5 Sahaja Yogis,
I was happy,

55:32.270 --> 55:34.360
when there are so many, I am happy.

55:34.360 --> 55:40.000
But I, when I see so many, I think

55:41.130 --> 55:49.684
there are so many powerful
personalities who are one with reality.

55:50.730 --> 55:57.934
This collective oneness
was never so.

55:58.465 --> 56:05.190
And so I would say that, on this day,

56:05.190 --> 56:11.280
what we have to do is to
kill the devils within ourselves;

56:11.487 --> 56:14.354
that’s all.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.940
If you want to really worship Me,

56:18.150 --> 56:22.757
that’s what you have to think,
what are the devils within you

56:22.757 --> 56:24.267
That’s all.

56:24.587 --> 56:27.818
So you don’t have to worry
otherwise for outside devils,

56:27.818 --> 56:31.109
they cannot do anything to you.

56:32.822 --> 56:36.371
May God bless you.
