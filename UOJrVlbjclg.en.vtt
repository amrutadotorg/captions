Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s

00:14.330 --> 00:18.029
Kingdom”
September 9, 1999

00:18.029 --> 00:19.890
Cabella, Italia

00:19.890 --> 00:28.949
Tonight we are going to worship Shri Krishna
as Virat.

00:28.949 --> 00:43.649
First is important to understand the incarnation
of Shri Krishna.

00:43.649 --> 00:47.000
Krishna word comes from the word Krishi.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.250
Krishi means agriculture.

00:49.250 --> 00:57.280
He’s sown the seeds of spirituality.

00:57.280 --> 01:08.010
And for that, first of all, He had to think,
“Where are we as far as spirituality is

01:08.010 --> 01:12.930
concerned, how is the land?”

01:12.930 --> 01:23.479
So what had happened at the time of Shri Rama
that He created lots of maryadas and by these

01:23.479 --> 01:29.030
maryadas people started mentally thinking
about it, “I am not supposed to do that,

01:29.030 --> 01:30.970
I am not supposed to do this.”

01:30.970 --> 01:38.950
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj.

01:38.950 --> 01:41.690
As a result people became extremely serious.

01:41.690 --> 01:50.750
They wouldn’t talk much and they wouldn’t
laugh; they wouldn’t enjoy anything.

01:50.750 --> 01:59.259
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

01:59.259 --> 02:13.010
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

02:13.010 --> 02:22.790
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

02:22.790 --> 02:35.880
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

02:35.880 --> 02:47.290
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

02:47.290 --> 03:04.260
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

03:04.260 --> 03:10.250
but he’s absolutely detached.

03:10.250 --> 03:25.260
And this detached person doesn’t take to
any grievances, jealousies, all these things.

03:25.260 --> 03:30.390
That He told.

03:30.390 --> 03:35.920
But how to achieve it He never told.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.819
And the second thing He described is that
you must work.

03:39.819 --> 03:40.819
You have to work.

03:40.819 --> 03:49.060
After all, you have got all the human tendencies
– is to work.

03:49.060 --> 03:57.159
But the fruit of the work, you leave it at
the Lotus Feet of God or you may call the

03:57.159 --> 04:01.030
divine Power.

04:01.030 --> 04:07.390
This is another trick of His, because He realized
how human beings were twisted and how they

04:07.390 --> 04:08.390
had a ego.

04:08.390 --> 04:11.340
If you tell them something, how they’ll
misinterpret it.

04:11.340 --> 04:16.560
So He took the other way round, that tell
them something absurd.

04:16.560 --> 04:31.770
Now whatever work you do, your ego is intact
and with that ego, you can never give it up

04:31.770 --> 04:36.320
at the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.

04:36.320 --> 04:43.110
So He made a impossible situation, that after
some time people will realize that this cannot

04:43.110 --> 04:52.620
be done and they’ll give up this idea of
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the

04:52.620 --> 04:54.210
Divine.

04:54.210 --> 04:59.380
This was the one how He prepared the land.

04:59.380 --> 05:06.320
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.

05:06.320 --> 05:13.730
Flowers, fruit and water.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.300
Whatever you offer Me, I will take it.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.080
I’ll take it.”

05:19.080 --> 05:26.260
But when you do that, when you do that you
must have ananya bhakti.

05:26.260 --> 05:40.310
Ananya means completely single-minded bhakti,
when there is not the other.

05:40.310 --> 05:45.150
This is only possible after realization.

05:45.150 --> 05:54.120
Only after realization you can put the fruits
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.

05:54.120 --> 06:02.400
And only after Self-realization you can have
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which

06:02.400 --> 06:07.300
is singular.

06:07.300 --> 06:14.340
These absurd conditions He put for human beings
because they were so much complicated.

06:14.340 --> 06:18.760
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

06:18.760 --> 06:19.760
“How?”

06:19.760 --> 06:24.470
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time.

06:24.470 --> 06:34.530
We are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

06:34.530 --> 06:35.530
singing.”

06:35.530 --> 06:43.030
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave.

06:43.030 --> 06:51.720
But it is the way He wanted to neutralize
the absurdities of human beings, that they

06:51.720 --> 06:54.110
thought this was the bhakti.

06:54.110 --> 06:55.540
Which is not.

06:55.540 --> 07:01.150
Ananya bhakti is only possible when you are
realized soul, when you are connected with

07:01.150 --> 07:06.350
the Divine, when there’s not the other.

07:06.350 --> 07:15.580
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

07:15.580 --> 07:17.210
on their stupidity.

07:17.210 --> 07:22.960
Because He thought that “If I tell them
directly do like this, do like that, then

07:22.960 --> 07:28.290
they’ll say, ‘Of course we did it, and
still we never achieved it.’”

07:28.290 --> 07:36.630
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur.

07:36.630 --> 07:44.040
For one month they walk in rags, singing the
songs and on the way they go on eating food

07:44.040 --> 07:46.270
at different places.

07:46.270 --> 07:51.000
According to them this is ananya bhakti, and
they achieve nothing.

07:51.000 --> 08:00.300
They have become very sick and very tired
and have a very bad old age.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.590
But who can tell them?

08:02.590 --> 08:05.050
They are all lost in it.

08:05.050 --> 08:14.950
So this is a way one could tackle human beings
to show their stupidity.

08:14.950 --> 08:20.900
And so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

08:20.900 --> 08:26.330
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

08:26.330 --> 08:30.500
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing.

08:30.500 --> 08:39.180
We can say He’s the One who was like a very
great agriculturist.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.110
So His name was Krishi – Krishna.

08:41.110 --> 08:47.870
There are so many things I have told you about
Him: how His name came as Krishna, then as

08:47.870 --> 08:56.890
how He was called as Radha, who was Radha,
who was Krishna and all those things.

08:56.890 --> 09:05.630
But when He talked of these things also He
told that you should become Sthitapragya.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.900
That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.220
Gyana means knowledge.

09:10.220 --> 09:14.210
So, you should get absolute knowledge.

09:14.210 --> 09:16.220
That He didn’t say how.

09:16.220 --> 09:20.620
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

09:20.620 --> 09:26.820
in Sahaja Yoga.

09:26.820 --> 09:32.800
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people.

09:32.800 --> 09:39.360
He thought by doing all these things in a
stupid manner, they might develop a discretion

09:39.360 --> 09:43.010
to know that this is not the way you can achieve
anything.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.370
You have to get your Self-realization.

09:45.370 --> 09:48.550
Discretion was very important.

09:48.550 --> 10:01.080
At this juncture, when we are facing a sort
of a challenge of this new millennium – that

10:01.080 --> 10:06.220
the whole world is going to be destroyed and
all those things people are talking – it

10:06.220 --> 10:17.720
is really very important to know through discretion
what is good and what is bad.

10:17.720 --> 10:23.760
One may talk of something as very good, something
as very bad.

10:23.760 --> 10:28.722
But the divine Discretion is very, very different.

10:28.722 --> 10:32.820
Very different and which acts by Itself.

10:32.820 --> 10:39.120
Once you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

10:39.120 --> 10:40.120
want to do it.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.690
I’ll give you My example.

10:42.690 --> 10:52.320
We went to buy a house and the fellow was,
you see, like a beggar he came.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.110
He said, “We have nothing.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.650
We have no food.

10:55.650 --> 11:00.790
They have taken away all our things and we
are just absolutely starving.”

11:00.790 --> 11:12.490
When they said that, when he said that “We
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt

11:12.490 --> 11:13.490
pity for him.

11:13.490 --> 11:15.390
I said, “All right, increase the price.”

11:15.390 --> 11:17.530
First we increased the price.

11:17.530 --> 11:20.900
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

11:20.900 --> 11:22.580
Still we increased the price.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.930
I told My husband, “You increase the price.”

11:24.930 --> 11:28.250
Though reluctantly, he increased the price.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.900
Third time again we increased the price.

11:30.900 --> 11:35.850
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

11:35.850 --> 11:42.440
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.”

11:42.440 --> 11:47.460
I just left them and sat in the car – at
the right moment.

11:47.460 --> 11:52.000
That was not such a good proposition or anything.

11:52.000 --> 11:58.910
But I could see they, I’m buying it out
of My pity; you may call it compassion.

11:58.910 --> 12:05.240
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

12:05.240 --> 12:06.710
out of it.”

12:06.710 --> 12:13.420
So this divine Discretion is a very, very
important thing, which we should see how it

12:13.420 --> 12:17.870
works and should be satisfied with it.

12:17.870 --> 12:23.980
Not to feel bad, that you have missed a chance
or anything, but you must feel very happy

12:23.980 --> 12:31.560
that this thing has happened and that your
divine discretion has taken on.

12:31.560 --> 12:38.570
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

12:38.570 --> 12:39.570
have done something wrong.

12:39.570 --> 12:45.210
But if it is divine, ultimately it will turn
out to be very good.

12:45.210 --> 12:50.190
I gave you a very basic example.

12:50.190 --> 12:59.010
But that is also very true when you practice
Sahaja Yoga.

12:59.010 --> 13:08.620
The discretion of divine Discretion is extremely
important to play a very great part in our

13:08.620 --> 13:18.040
lives, because this divine Discretion gives
us the real joy of our being, of our self,

13:18.040 --> 13:21.070
of Sahaja Yoga.

13:21.070 --> 13:28.480
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy.

13:28.480 --> 13:35.990
But with all these maryadas of Shri Rama,
He didn’t know how to do it.

13:35.990 --> 13:43.839
So to give people joy He said, “All right,
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,

13:43.839 --> 13:52.350
all sorts of things,” and with that He really
originated many things which were sort of

13:52.350 --> 13:54.220
not serious.

13:54.220 --> 13:58.480
May look frivolous, but in that there was
joy expressing.

13:58.480 --> 14:08.171
All that He did to give them a full idea as
for a Sahaja yogi or for a, you can say, for

14:08.171 --> 14:14.840
a self realized soul, what should be the attitude
towards everything.

14:14.840 --> 14:24.250
But it is not that you have to do it, but
it just works out, it is like that, that in

14:24.250 --> 14:29.020
the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.

14:29.020 --> 14:31.020
Enjoyment.

14:31.020 --> 14:38.900
And that is what His idea was, to create a
sense of joy among people.

14:38.900 --> 14:43.810
Many people – there are lots of critics
– have criticized this part of His life.

14:43.810 --> 14:47.710
According to them, religion means you should
become just old.

14:47.710 --> 14:53.700
At the age of twenty years you should become
an old man of eighty years – something like

14:53.700 --> 14:58.640
that, funny ideas of religious achievement.

14:58.640 --> 15:04.510
But He talked of joy and He never talked of
renunciation.

15:04.510 --> 15:13.000
He never talked that “You give up your family,
you give up your children, you give up everything,”

15:13.000 --> 15:14.460
never, never.

15:14.460 --> 15:19.560
He said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

15:19.560 --> 15:24.980
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment.

15:24.980 --> 15:28.800
With attachment you can never enjoy.

15:28.800 --> 15:35.210
If you are attached to something, you cannot
enjoy anything in a full way.

15:35.210 --> 15:38.339
Like, supposing you are attached to your child.

15:38.339 --> 15:41.280
Very simple thing, you are attached to your
child.

15:41.280 --> 15:47.020
You’re attached to your child, then you
will be bothered about things which should

15:47.020 --> 15:50.770
not be there, which will not give joy to the
child either.

15:50.770 --> 15:58.150
You’ll not allow your child, say, to go
out or to talk to people, whatever it is – all

15:58.150 --> 16:00.990
kinds of restrictions you will put.

16:00.990 --> 16:09.630
But if you have really the divine discretion,
then you will know with whom he should talk,

16:09.630 --> 16:18.170
where he should go, what he should enjoy and
you will see that he enjoys life.

16:18.170 --> 16:26.450
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

16:26.450 --> 16:28.180
thing.

16:28.180 --> 16:38.210
If you are detached, then you can see it,
say, from above … above him, above the thing.

16:38.210 --> 16:42.480
If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.070
As I said, now, see the carpets are there.

16:46.070 --> 16:49.450
They are very, very beautiful carpets.

16:49.450 --> 16:55.410
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried

16:55.410 --> 17:02.680
because I am attached – that these carpets
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.

17:02.680 --> 17:06.980
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at
those carpets and what do I see?

17:06.980 --> 17:08.240
The joy.

17:08.240 --> 17:13.480
The joy that is put in by the artist who has
made them.

17:13.480 --> 17:21.750
And that joy really tries to reflect in Me
also.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.709
That joy comes in Me.

17:24.709 --> 17:34.090
So to have anything, attachment to anything,
there will be joy … I should say there’ll

17:34.090 --> 17:37.650
be happiness but not joy.

17:37.650 --> 17:46.330
Because joy is single and happiness is double
– happiness and unhappiness.

17:46.330 --> 17:51.130
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

17:51.130 --> 17:52.770
is there.”

17:52.770 --> 17:55.730
But joy is all pervading.

17:55.730 --> 17:59.230
It has no boundaries.

17:59.230 --> 18:04.220
And you just get dissolved, you get dissolved
in the ocean of joy.

18:04.220 --> 18:11.880
That was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that
cut out these maryadas.

18:11.880 --> 18:18.030
Nowadays we see the maryadas of so many things
are really useless.

18:18.030 --> 18:23.340
For example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion.

18:23.340 --> 18:27.510
See when they live in maryadas then what happens?

18:27.510 --> 18:39.059
They sort of coggle it or they have all kinds
of germination inside like the pond, which

18:39.059 --> 18:44.880
is absolutely bound, it is not flowing like
river.

18:44.880 --> 18:56.110
So like that, you see, it becomes a kind of
a closed mind with these maryadas.

18:56.110 --> 19:03.440
And when you have this maryadas, you start
thinking, “Whether I should do it or not;

19:03.440 --> 19:06.130
whether I’ll enjoy it or not.”

19:06.130 --> 19:11.080
With these maryadas only, you kill the joy.

19:11.080 --> 19:17.180
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

19:17.180 --> 19:24.050
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

19:24.050 --> 19:28.200
things of their religion, they cannot come.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.080
They think, “This is our religion,” while
they don’t understand.

19:32.080 --> 19:39.480
Falsehood becomes the maryadas and they don’t
understand that what is the maryada actually

19:39.480 --> 19:42.590
made by the religion also.

19:42.590 --> 19:45.150
You see now in Islam what is happening is.

19:45.150 --> 19:53.460
With these maryadas, they want to have another
country, this thing, that thing.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.920
In other Christian religion also same thing
happening.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.580
Also in Hindu religion.

19:58.580 --> 20:05.309
All these maryadas are really stagnating them
completely, and they are getting crushed into

20:05.309 --> 20:06.429
it.

20:06.429 --> 20:09.790
There’s no discretion.

20:09.790 --> 20:13.470
Because they have said it, they do it.

20:13.470 --> 20:20.160
They are so much blind-folded about it, that
they cannot see what is right and what is

20:20.160 --> 20:21.160
wrong.

20:21.160 --> 20:26.850
But after Sahaj, you can see, you can laugh
at them and you can see.

20:26.850 --> 20:32.220
Then we have social maryadas.

20:32.220 --> 20:39.330
Social maryadas are there which are sometimes,
when abandoned can become very horrid also.

20:39.330 --> 20:46.660
Like in the West now, the women think that
the less dress they wear, the more beautiful

20:46.660 --> 20:47.660
they are.

20:47.660 --> 20:50.030
This is a new thing they have started.

20:50.030 --> 20:52.130
Now this absurd.

20:52.130 --> 20:59.640
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

20:59.640 --> 21:05.200
want to have any clothes because we were animals.

21:05.200 --> 21:11.600
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s
why so many women do not want to wear full

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
dresses.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.240
It’s just animal behavior.

21:15.240 --> 21:22.170
So the maryada of – good maryadas also people
can give up saying that “We don’t want

21:22.170 --> 21:23.170
any maryadas.

21:23.170 --> 21:25.740
We are free; we can do whatever we like.”

21:25.740 --> 21:30.310
But in that freedom what do you achieve?

21:30.310 --> 21:37.620
Your animal instinct works in that freedom
and you think you are a very free personality.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.270
Then we have maryadas of our country.

21:40.270 --> 21:44.210
God has not made different, different countries
at all.

21:44.210 --> 21:48.790
Nor it is true there are different countries,
but variety is there.

21:48.790 --> 21:53.010
Variety of people, variety of places is there.

21:53.010 --> 22:01.250
These varieties must be accepted as something
very artistic and one should not get ruined

22:01.250 --> 22:08.320
and confused with those ideas that “We are
Americans, we are Indians, we are this and

22:08.320 --> 22:09.480
we are that.”

22:09.480 --> 22:10.480
You’re not.

22:10.480 --> 22:15.940
Now you can know after Sahaja Yoga, that you
are all Sahaja yogis and you don’t belong

22:15.940 --> 22:18.179
to any country as such.

22:18.179 --> 22:21.549
The country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

22:21.549 --> 22:30.070
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

22:30.070 --> 22:38.440
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

22:38.440 --> 22:44.130
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that.

22:44.130 --> 22:49.720
All over the world there’s going on, “We
want this land; we want that land.”

22:49.720 --> 22:53.400
Land belongs to God, not to human beings.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.929
And what is the use of fighting for land?

22:55.929 --> 22:57.720
I don’t understand.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.800
But this confusion is there and illusion is
there.

23:00.800 --> 23:06.140
And people work out on this confusion and
illusion to such an extent that they ruin

23:06.140 --> 23:08.620
their lives, the lives of their children.

23:08.620 --> 23:16.620
So many people are lost, so many people are
in the lunatic asylum, I should say, because

23:16.620 --> 23:20.540
they end up in some sort of a refugee camp.

23:20.540 --> 23:25.030
They are having a good house, nicely living
there.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.350
Then you become a refugee.

23:27.350 --> 23:28.850
Why?

23:28.850 --> 23:36.930
Because they believe that they can have their
own land, they can have their own place and

23:36.930 --> 23:39.020
they should live there.

23:39.020 --> 23:45.570
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

23:45.570 --> 23:48.910
lands and that’s how people fight for land.

23:48.910 --> 23:56.011
There’s no need to fight for land or fight
for your country or fight for this or fight

23:56.011 --> 23:57.280
for that.

23:57.280 --> 24:04.429
But the situation is such that unless and
until you fight, you cannot get to the truth.

24:04.429 --> 24:12.010
And that’s why if you remember that Shri
Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.010
Fight.

24:13.010 --> 24:15.059
You have to fight, that’s your work.

24:15.059 --> 24:21.080
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

24:21.080 --> 24:25.100
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

24:25.100 --> 24:33.309
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

24:33.309 --> 24:35.080
what they deserved.

24:35.080 --> 24:43.080
They were deceived, and this is what Shri
Krishna said that “You should not by any

24:43.080 --> 24:52.510
chance become a slave of these people, but
you fight it back.”

24:52.510 --> 24:57.610
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion.

24:57.610 --> 25:03.429
Is again the divine discretion where you have
to fight because you don’t want to be a

25:03.429 --> 25:04.480
slave.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.929
If you are a slave, you are no good.

25:06.929 --> 25:08.840
So for that you can fight.

25:08.840 --> 25:17.120
But when people start fighting for separation
of a territory, is not correct.

25:17.120 --> 25:22.200
On the contrary, one should never think of
separating from the main lands.

25:22.200 --> 25:26.179
Because it creates lots of problems.

25:26.179 --> 25:29.970
But now we believe in the global religion.

25:29.970 --> 25:32.790
We believe in the global territory.

25:32.790 --> 25:35.110
We don’t have to ask for anything.

25:35.110 --> 25:38.690
Anywhere you go, you are the citizen of that
place.

25:38.690 --> 25:44.240
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the
whole Russians will be with you.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.220
You go to America, they’ll be with you.

25:47.220 --> 25:53.070
That’s how because all these are ideas of
human beings, and if the human beings get

25:53.070 --> 26:01.470
transformed there will be no problem of any
war or any territory to be achieved.

26:01.470 --> 26:08.960
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us.

26:08.960 --> 26:19.720
As you know that this is a part and parcel
of the Vishuddhi Chakra, where Shri Krishna

26:19.720 --> 26:29.740
resides; but when He rises to your Sahasrara,
when He rises to that level, then He becomes

26:29.740 --> 26:32.670
Virata.

26:32.670 --> 26:45.780
So Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head,
here above the Agnya, and this Virat is the

26:45.780 --> 26:53.130
form of Shri Krishna who has risen above the
Agnya.

26:53.130 --> 27:02.070
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can

27:02.070 --> 27:03.480
say.

27:03.480 --> 27:12.200
Because, unless and until you are above your
ego, you are still involved with yourself

27:12.200 --> 27:15.970
and with wrong ideas of maryadas.

27:15.970 --> 27:22.980
But when you rise above that and you become
the Virat, the great, then you are in the

27:22.980 --> 27:25.410
land of Virata.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.450
And Virata’s powers are tremendous.

27:28.450 --> 27:32.850
Has been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

27:32.850 --> 27:39.750
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally.

27:39.750 --> 27:52.730
It acts in such a manner that you sit here
and anywhere it can act.

27:52.730 --> 27:53.770
You have seen that now.

27:53.770 --> 27:57.730
Many a times people say, “Mother it’s
a miracle.

27:57.730 --> 28:05.299
My mother was sick and she was not here and
I just prayed and she got all right.”

28:05.299 --> 28:09.270
This is all the power of Virat.

28:09.270 --> 28:17.850
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

28:17.850 --> 28:21.780
a manner that everything we are connected
with.

28:21.780 --> 28:24.470
We are not separate.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.900
And every drop is connected with the ocean.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.950
We are connected with the whole universe.

28:30.950 --> 28:42.721
And when you become a citizens, I should say,
of Virat, then all the things with which you

28:42.721 --> 28:54.250
are connected also get your vibrations, your
ideas, your ambitions.

28:54.250 --> 28:59.590
Everything passes through that and it works
– it works.

28:59.590 --> 29:04.590
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives.

29:04.590 --> 29:08.500
It is the Virata Shakti that works.

29:08.500 --> 29:18.190
Now for that we have to know how to do worship
of Virata.

29:18.190 --> 29:26.260
First of all you have to rise above your ego
– very important.

29:26.260 --> 29:29.299
Otherwise how can you worship?

29:29.299 --> 29:39.679
There is your ego standing in between and
how can you rise up to the point of Virat?

29:39.679 --> 29:42.900
You have to pass through that.

29:42.900 --> 29:50.690
Once you are above your ego, you enter into
the kingdom of Virata.

29:50.690 --> 30:00.130
There the King is the Virat and you are the
subject who are looked after completely by

30:00.130 --> 30:03.740
Virata Shakti, by the power of Virata.

30:03.740 --> 30:10.970
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

30:10.970 --> 30:18.400
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

30:18.400 --> 30:20.270
to you.

30:20.270 --> 30:22.600
Supposing a person is of that level.

30:22.600 --> 30:30.740
Now there may be a war in some other country
– it can stop.

30:30.740 --> 30:35.870
Somebody who is being oppressed can win over.

30:35.870 --> 30:39.060
Anywhere your compassion moves it works out.

30:39.060 --> 30:42.660
Whenever your attention will go, it will work
out.

30:42.660 --> 30:47.550
And sometimes you are surprised as to how
it works, “Mother, how these things work

30:47.550 --> 30:48.550
out?

30:48.550 --> 30:53.320
How coincidences … how these coincidences
have taken place?”

30:53.320 --> 31:01.340
Only thing is you have crossed that state
of your ego and have gone into the state of

31:01.340 --> 31:10.049
Virat, which is a very important thing to
do – is to enter into the area of Virata.

31:10.049 --> 31:12.419
Then you don’t think, “This is your country.

31:12.419 --> 31:14.799
This belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

31:14.799 --> 31:17.630
This belonging business finishes off.

31:17.630 --> 31:19.900
Then you belong to Virat.

31:19.900 --> 31:28.250
And He uses you for His own purpose in the
sense that when your whole thinking is different

31:28.250 --> 31:33.590
– becomes global thinking, then He acts.

31:33.590 --> 31:35.970
And then His powers are many-fold.

31:35.970 --> 31:43.419
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch
to call people.

31:43.419 --> 31:46.799
I have given conches to all the leaders.

31:46.799 --> 31:52.470
So we have to now announce and call people.

31:52.470 --> 32:00.419
But at the level of Virat, you don’t have
to do all that.

32:00.419 --> 32:08.560
At the level of Virat it just – people see,
they’ll know.

32:08.560 --> 32:13.590
Just they will watch you and they will know.

32:13.590 --> 32:20.490
Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

32:20.490 --> 32:22.050
shining all the time.

32:22.050 --> 32:25.280
So, they’ll be impressed.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.720
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

32:27.720 --> 32:36.000
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

32:36.000 --> 32:43.080
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

32:43.080 --> 32:45.590
are actually not true.

32:45.590 --> 32:52.179
And all these things on which you want to
exist are no more.

32:52.179 --> 33:02.640
People like to show off their wealth, some
people like to be very sort of demonstrative

33:02.640 --> 33:08.030
of what they think they are.

33:08.030 --> 33:16.400
But in the case of a person who rises above
his ego, and he’s a part and parcel of that

33:16.400 --> 33:23.440
Virata shakti, enters into the kingdom of
Virata, he knows he is very small.

33:23.440 --> 33:30.980
He is very small compared to that and he just
dissolves into that Shakti.

33:30.980 --> 33:34.559
And this should happen to us that we should
humble down.

33:34.559 --> 33:44.781
We should humble down and know that our powers,
whatever we have, if they give us ego, we

33:44.781 --> 33:46.600
should get rid of it.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.600
We should not have that ego.

33:48.600 --> 33:56.730
We should get rid of it and we should actually
achieve that state where you can be called

33:56.730 --> 33:58.980
as citizens of the Virata’s Power.

33:58.980 --> 33:59.980
May God bless you all.

33:59.980 --> 34:00.980
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have to be like children.

34:00.980 --> 34:01.980
You are children there.

34:01.980 --> 34:02.980
As children you enter.

34:02.980 --> 34:03.980
As Christ has said, “When you enter into
the Kingdom of God you have to be like children.”

34:03.980 --> 34:04.980
And that’s what you have to be today, all
of you to be innocent like children.

34:04.980 --> 34:04.987
You have to be innocent like children.
