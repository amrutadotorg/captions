Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.029
Kingdom”
September 9, 1999

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.890
Cabella, Italia

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.949
Tonight we are going to worship Shri Krishna
as Virat.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:43.649
First is important to understand the incarnation
of Shri Krishna.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.000
Krishna word comes from the word Krishi.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.250
Krishi means agriculture.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.280
He’s sown the seeds of spirituality.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:08.010
And for that, first of all, He had to think,
“Where are we as far as spirituality is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.930
concerned, how is the land?”

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:23.479
So what had happened at the time of Shri Rama
that He created lots of maryadas and by these

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.030
maryadas people started mentally thinking
about it, “I am not supposed to do that,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.970
I am not supposed to do this.”

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.950
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.690
As a result people became extremely serious.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:50.750
They wouldn’t talk much and they wouldn’t
laugh; they wouldn’t enjoy anything.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.259
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:13.010
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:22.790
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:35.880
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:47.290
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:03:04.260
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.250
but he’s absolutely detached.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:25.260
And this detached person doesn’t take to
any grievances, jealousies, all these things.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.390
That He told.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.920
But how to achieve it He never told.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.819
And the second thing He described is that
you must work.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.819
You have to work.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:49.060
After all, you have got all the human tendencies
– is to work.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.159
But the fruit of the work, you leave it at
the Lotus Feet of God or you may call the

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.030
divine Power.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.390
This is another trick of His, because He realized
how human beings were twisted and how they

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.390
had a ego.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.340
If you tell them something, how they’ll
misinterpret it.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.560
So He took the other way round, that tell
them something absurd.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:31.770
Now whatever work you do, your ego is intact
and with that ego, you can never give it up

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.320
at the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.110
So He made a impossible situation, that after
some time people will realize that this cannot

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:52.620
be done and they’ll give up this idea of
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.210
Divine.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.380
This was the one how He prepared the land.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.320
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.730
Flowers, fruit and water.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.300
Whatever you offer Me, I will take it.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.080
I’ll take it.”

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.260
But when you do that, when you do that you
must have ananya bhakti.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:40.310
Ananya means completely single-minded bhakti,
when there is not the other.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.150
This is only possible after realization.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:54.120
Only after realization you can put the fruits
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.400
And only after Self-realization you can have
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.300
is singular.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:14.340
These absurd conditions He put for human beings
because they were so much complicated.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.760
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760
“How?”

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.470
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:34.530
We are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.530
singing.”

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:43.030
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:51.720
But it is the way He wanted to neutralize
the absurdities of human beings, that they

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.110
thought this was the bhakti.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.540
Which is not.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.150
Ananya bhakti is only possible when you are
realized soul, when you are connected with

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.350
the Divine, when there’s not the other.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:15.580
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.210
on their stupidity.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.960
Because He thought that “If I tell them
directly do like this, do like that, then

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.290
they’ll say, ‘Of course we did it, and
still we never achieved it.’”

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:36.630
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:44.040
For one month they walk in rags, singing the
songs and on the way they go on eating food

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.270
at different places.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.000
According to them this is ananya bhakti, and
they achieve nothing.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.300
They have become very sick and very tired
and have a very bad old age.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.590
But who can tell them?

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.050
They are all lost in it.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:14.950
So this is a way one could tackle human beings
to show their stupidity.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:20.900
And so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.330
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.500
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:39.180
We can say He’s the One who was like a very
great agriculturist.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.110
So His name was Krishi – Krishna.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:47.870
There are so many things I have told you about
Him: how His name came as Krishna, then as

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:56.890
how He was called as Radha, who was Radha,
who was Krishna and all those things.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:05.630
But when He talked of these things also He
told that you should become Sthitapragya.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.900
That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.220
Gyana means knowledge.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.210
So, you should get absolute knowledge.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.220
That He didn’t say how.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.620
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.820
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:32.800
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.360
He thought by doing all these things in a
stupid manner, they might develop a discretion

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.010
to know that this is not the way you can achieve
anything.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.370
You have to get your Self-realization.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.550
Discretion was very important.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:10:01.080
At this juncture, when we are facing a sort
of a challenge of this new millennium – that

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.220
the whole world is going to be destroyed and
all those things people are talking – it

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:17.720
is really very important to know through discretion
what is good and what is bad.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.760
One may talk of something as very good, something
as very bad.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.722
But the divine Discretion is very, very different.

00:10:28.722 --> 00:10:32.820
Very different and which acts by Itself.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.120
Once you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
want to do it.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.690
I’ll give you My example.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:52.320
We went to buy a house and the fellow was,
you see, like a beggar he came.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.110
He said, “We have nothing.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.650
We have no food.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.790
They have taken away all our things and we
are just absolutely starving.”

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:12.490
When they said that, when he said that “We
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.490
pity for him.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.390
I said, “All right, increase the price.”

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.530
First we increased the price.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.900
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.580
Still we increased the price.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.930
I told My husband, “You increase the price.”

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.250
Though reluctantly, he increased the price.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.900
Third time again we increased the price.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.850
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:42.440
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.”

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.460
I just left them and sat in the car – at
the right moment.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.000
That was not such a good proposition or anything.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.910
But I could see they, I’m buying it out
of My pity; you may call it compassion.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:05.240
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.710
out of it.”

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:13.420
So this divine Discretion is a very, very
important thing, which we should see how it

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.870
works and should be satisfied with it.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:23.980
Not to feel bad, that you have missed a chance
or anything, but you must feel very happy

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:31.560
that this thing has happened and that your
divine discretion has taken on.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:38.570
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.570
have done something wrong.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:45.210
But if it is divine, ultimately it will turn
out to be very good.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:50.190
I gave you a very basic example.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:59.010
But that is also very true when you practice
Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:08.620
The discretion of divine Discretion is extremely
important to play a very great part in our

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:18.040
lives, because this divine Discretion gives
us the real joy of our being, of our self,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.070
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:28.480
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:35.990
But with all these maryadas of Shri Rama,
He didn’t know how to do it.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:43.839
So to give people joy He said, “All right,
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:52.350
all sorts of things,” and with that He really
originated many things which were sort of

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.220
not serious.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.480
May look frivolous, but in that there was
joy expressing.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:08.171
All that He did to give them a full idea as
for a Sahaja yogi or for a, you can say, for

00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:14.840
a self realized soul, what should be the attitude
towards everything.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:24.250
But it is not that you have to do it, but
it just works out, it is like that, that in

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:29.020
the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.020
Enjoyment.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:38.900
And that is what His idea was, to create a
sense of joy among people.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.810
Many people – there are lots of critics
– have criticized this part of His life.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.710
According to them, religion means you should
become just old.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:53.700
At the age of twenty years you should become
an old man of eighty years – something like

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.640
that, funny ideas of religious achievement.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.510
But He talked of joy and He never talked of
renunciation.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:13.000
He never talked that “You give up your family,
you give up your children, you give up everything,”

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.460
never, never.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.560
He said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.980
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.800
With attachment you can never enjoy.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:35.210
If you are attached to something, you cannot
enjoy anything in a full way.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.339
Like, supposing you are attached to your child.

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:41.280
Very simple thing, you are attached to your
child.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.020
You’re attached to your child, then you
will be bothered about things which should

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.770
not be there, which will not give joy to the
child either.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:58.150
You’ll not allow your child, say, to go
out or to talk to people, whatever it is – all

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.990
kinds of restrictions you will put.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:09.630
But if you have really the divine discretion,
then you will know with whom he should talk,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:18.170
where he should go, what he should enjoy and
you will see that he enjoys life.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:26.450
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.180
thing.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:38.210
If you are detached, then you can see it,
say, from above … above him, above the thing.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.480
If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.070
As I said, now, see the carpets are there.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.450
They are very, very beautiful carpets.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:55.410
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried

00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:02.680
because I am attached – that these carpets
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.980
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at
those carpets and what do I see?

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.240
The joy.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.480
The joy that is put in by the artist who has
made them.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:21.750
And that joy really tries to reflect in Me
also.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.709
That joy comes in Me.

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:34.090
So to have anything, attachment to anything,
there will be joy … I should say there’ll

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.650
be happiness but not joy.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:46.330
Because joy is single and happiness is double
– happiness and unhappiness.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:51.130
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.770
is there.”

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.730
But joy is all pervading.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.230
It has no boundaries.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:04.220
And you just get dissolved, you get dissolved
in the ocean of joy.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:11.880
That was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that
cut out these maryadas.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:18.030
Nowadays we see the maryadas of so many things
are really useless.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:23.340
For example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.510
See when they live in maryadas then what happens?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:39.059
They sort of coggle it or they have all kinds
of germination inside like the pond, which

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:44.880
is absolutely bound, it is not flowing like
river.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:56.110
So like that, you see, it becomes a kind of
a closed mind with these maryadas.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:03.440
And when you have this maryadas, you start
thinking, “Whether I should do it or not;

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.130
whether I’ll enjoy it or not.”

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:11.080
With these maryadas only, you kill the joy.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:17.180
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:24.050
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.200
things of their religion, they cannot come.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.080
They think, “This is our religion,” while
they don’t understand.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:39.480
Falsehood becomes the maryadas and they don’t
understand that what is the maryada actually

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.590
made by the religion also.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.150
You see now in Islam what is happening is.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:53.460
With these maryadas, they want to have another
country, this thing, that thing.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.920
In other Christian religion also same thing
happening.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.580
Also in Hindu religion.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:05.309
All these maryadas are really stagnating them
completely, and they are getting crushed into

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:06.429
it.

00:20:06.429 --> 00:20:09.790
There’s no discretion.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.470
Because they have said it, they do it.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:20.160
They are so much blind-folded about it, that
they cannot see what is right and what is

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160
wrong.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.850
But after Sahaj, you can see, you can laugh
at them and you can see.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:32.220
Then we have social maryadas.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:39.330
Social maryadas are there which are sometimes,
when abandoned can become very horrid also.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:46.660
Like in the West now, the women think that
the less dress they wear, the more beautiful

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.660
they are.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.030
This is a new thing they have started.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.130
Now this absurd.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:59.640
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.200
want to have any clothes because we were animals.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.600
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s
why so many women do not want to wear full

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.600
dresses.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.240
It’s just animal behavior.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:22.170
So the maryada of – good maryadas also people
can give up saying that “We don’t want

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.170
any maryadas.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.740
We are free; we can do whatever we like.”

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.310
But in that freedom what do you achieve?

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:37.620
Your animal instinct works in that freedom
and you think you are a very free personality.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.270
Then we have maryadas of our country.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.210
God has not made different, different countries
at all.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.790
Nor it is true there are different countries,
but variety is there.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:53.010
Variety of people, variety of places is there.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:22:01.250
These varieties must be accepted as something
very artistic and one should not get ruined

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:08.320
and confused with those ideas that “We are
Americans, we are Indians, we are this and

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.480
we are that.”

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480
You’re not.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.940
Now you can know after Sahaja Yoga, that you
are all Sahaja yogis and you don’t belong

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.179
to any country as such.

00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:21.549
The country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:30.070
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:38.440
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:44.130
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:49.720
All over the world there’s going on, “We
want this land; we want that land.”

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.400
Land belongs to God, not to human beings.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.929
And what is the use of fighting for land?

00:22:55.929 --> 00:22:57.720
I don’t understand.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.800
But this confusion is there and illusion is
there.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.140
And people work out on this confusion and
illusion to such an extent that they ruin

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.620
their lives, the lives of their children.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:16.620
So many people are lost, so many people are
in the lunatic asylum, I should say, because

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.540
they end up in some sort of a refugee camp.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.030
They are having a good house, nicely living
there.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.350
Then you become a refugee.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.850
Why?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:36.930
Because they believe that they can have their
own land, they can have their own place and

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.020
they should live there.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:45.570
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.910
lands and that’s how people fight for land.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:56.011
There’s no need to fight for land or fight
for your country or fight for this or fight

00:23:56.011 --> 00:23:57.280
for that.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:04.429
But the situation is such that unless and
until you fight, you cannot get to the truth.

00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:12.010
And that’s why if you remember that Shri
Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.010
Fight.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.059
You have to fight, that’s your work.

00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:21.080
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.100
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:33.309
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

00:24:33.309 --> 00:24:35.080
what they deserved.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:43.080
They were deceived, and this is what Shri
Krishna said that “You should not by any

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:52.510
chance become a slave of these people, but
you fight it back.”

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:57.610
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:03.429
Is again the divine discretion where you have
to fight because you don’t want to be a

00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:04.480
slave.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.929
If you are a slave, you are no good.

00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:08.840
So for that you can fight.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:17.120
But when people start fighting for separation
of a territory, is not correct.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.200
On the contrary, one should never think of
separating from the main lands.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.179
Because it creates lots of problems.

00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:29.970
But now we believe in the global religion.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.790
We believe in the global territory.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.110
We don’t have to ask for anything.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.690
Anywhere you go, you are the citizen of that
place.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:44.240
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the
whole Russians will be with you.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.220
You go to America, they’ll be with you.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:53.070
That’s how because all these are ideas of
human beings, and if the human beings get

00:25:53.070 --> 00:26:01.470
transformed there will be no problem of any
war or any territory to be achieved.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:08.960
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:19.720
As you know that this is a part and parcel
of the Vishuddhi Chakra, where Shri Krishna

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:29.740
resides; but when He rises to your Sahasrara,
when He rises to that level, then He becomes

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.670
Virata.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:45.780
So Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head,
here above the Agnya, and this Virat is the

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:53.130
form of Shri Krishna who has risen above the
Agnya.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:27:02.070
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.480
say.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:12.200
Because, unless and until you are above your
ego, you are still involved with yourself

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.970
and with wrong ideas of maryadas.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:22.980
But when you rise above that and you become
the Virat, the great, then you are in the

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.410
land of Virata.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.450
And Virata’s powers are tremendous.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:32.850
Has been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:39.750
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:52.730
It acts in such a manner that you sit here
and anywhere it can act.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:53.770
You have seen that now.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:57.730
Many a times people say, “Mother it’s
a miracle.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:05.299
My mother was sick and she was not here and
I just prayed and she got all right.”

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:09.270
This is all the power of Virat.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:17.850
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.780
a manner that everything we are connected
with.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.470
We are not separate.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.900
And every drop is connected with the ocean.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.950
We are connected with the whole universe.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:42.721
And when you become a citizens, I should say,
of Virat, then all the things with which you

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:54.250
are connected also get your vibrations, your
ideas, your ambitions.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:59.590
Everything passes through that and it works
– it works.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:04.590
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.500
It is the Virata Shakti that works.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:18.190
Now for that we have to know how to do worship
of Virata.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:26.260
First of all you have to rise above your ego
– very important.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.299
Otherwise how can you worship?

00:29:29.299 --> 00:29:39.679
There is your ego standing in between and
how can you rise up to the point of Virat?

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:42.900
You have to pass through that.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:50.690
Once you are above your ego, you enter into
the kingdom of Virata.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:30:00.130
There the King is the Virat and you are the
subject who are looked after completely by

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.740
Virata Shakti, by the power of Virata.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:10.970
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:18.400
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.270
to you.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.600
Supposing a person is of that level.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:30.740
Now there may be a war in some other country
– it can stop.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.870
Somebody who is being oppressed can win over.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:39.060
Anywhere your compassion moves it works out.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.660
Whenever your attention will go, it will work
out.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.550
And sometimes you are surprised as to how
it works, “Mother, how these things work

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.550
out?

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:53.320
How coincidences … how these coincidences
have taken place?”

00:30:53.320 --> 00:31:01.340
Only thing is you have crossed that state
of your ego and have gone into the state of

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:10.049
Virat, which is a very important thing to
do – is to enter into the area of Virata.

00:31:10.049 --> 00:31:12.419
Then you don’t think, “This is your country.

00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:14.799
This belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:17.630
This belonging business finishes off.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.900
Then you belong to Virat.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:28.250
And He uses you for His own purpose in the
sense that when your whole thinking is different

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:33.590
– becomes global thinking, then He acts.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.970
And then His powers are many-fold.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:43.419
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch
to call people.

00:31:43.419 --> 00:31:46.799
I have given conches to all the leaders.

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:52.470
So we have to now announce and call people.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:32:00.419
But at the level of Virat, you don’t have
to do all that.

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:08.560
At the level of Virat it just – people see,
they’ll know.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.590
Just they will watch you and they will know.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:20.490
Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.050
shining all the time.

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.280
So, they’ll be impressed.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.720
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:36.000
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.080
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.590
are actually not true.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:52.179
And all these things on which you want to
exist are no more.

00:32:52.179 --> 00:33:02.640
People like to show off their wealth, some
people like to be very sort of demonstrative

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.030
of what they think they are.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:16.400
But in the case of a person who rises above
his ego, and he’s a part and parcel of that

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:23.440
Virata shakti, enters into the kingdom of
Virata, he knows he is very small.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.980
He is very small compared to that and he just
dissolves into that Shakti.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.559
And this should happen to us that we should
humble down.

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:44.781
We should humble down and know that our powers,
whatever we have, if they give us ego, we

00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:46.600
should get rid of it.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.600
We should not have that ego.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:56.730
We should get rid of it and we should actually
achieve that state where you can be called

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.980
as citizens of the Virata’s Power.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980
May God bless you all.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have to be like children.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.980
You are children there.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.980
As children you enter.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:03.980
As Christ has said, “When you enter into
the Kingdom of God you have to be like children.”

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.980
And that’s what you have to be today, all
of you to be innocent like children.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:04.987
You have to be innocent like children.
