00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.962
So, first thing that happens to you is
that your attention becomes subtler.

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.483
Attention becoming subtler means

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.367
you start understanding deeper things.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.773
For example, a bird can see a flower 
but cannot feel the beauty of a flower.

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:51.209
And a unrealised person can see 
the beauty of a flower,

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:54.613
but cannot see the vibrations of the flower.

00:00:57.483 --> 00:01:04.373
So you become subtler, your 
attention becomes subtler.

00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:17.590
You definitely are at a higher evolutionary 
stage than the other people are.

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:31.115
Now we have to see how we use our attention.

00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:41.210
You have seen, even when 
you were not realised, that,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.272
supposing you start developing an art

00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:50.862
in your hand from your very childhood,

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:59.631
then you develop the deftness 
of that particular art,

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:04.074
because a kind of a myelin 
sheath grows on the nerves.

00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:10.517
In the same way, when you are realised,

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:14.607
I would say when you are a newly born person,

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.241
if you start respecting your attention

00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:30.489
then gradually you develop 
a deftness for Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:39.246
But so many people, when they get 
realised, they hardly come second time.

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.995
Even if they come second time,

00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:51.760
they do not develop the feeling 
of vibrations more,

00:02:55.823 --> 00:03:00.748
they still go on being busy with 
their day-to-day work,

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:09.050
wasting their attention on things which 
do not give you the subtler feeling.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:31.513
So the subtleness, the deftness of the art 
of Sahaja does not develop itself.

00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:43.909
For example, I would say a 
person who is over-read,

00:03:45.764 --> 00:03:53.242
as soon as he gets his realisation he 
starts tallying it with what he has read,

00:03:55.188 --> 00:03:59.458
this makes his attention again wasted.

00:03:59.578 --> 00:04:07.438
As it is, his attention has been 
fixed by these conventional ideas;

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:09.573
some of them are correct, some are incorrect,

00:04:09.613 --> 00:04:13.290
some are absolutely faulty, some are useless.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.496
Some are only because they 
wanted to make money,

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:18.135
they have published some trash.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:35.283
As soon as you get realisation, you go 
back to your own gross awareness

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:40.118
and start tallying this subtle with the gross,

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:47.814
so you start again losing your vibrations.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.270
Actually after getting realisation 
I have seen, with small children,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.173
they sleep for very long hours.

00:04:57.788 --> 00:05:00.890
They become little inactive for some time.

00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:06.170
But if an elder gets it he will 
immediately go to the book store,

00:05:06.257 --> 00:05:09.925
buy one book on Kundalini and 
start reading about it.

00:05:18.712 --> 00:05:25.085
Then some of you, not understanding 
that you have become somebody else,

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:30.378
take it for granted, “Alright, 
Mataji has been very kind;

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:34.428
She says I am far, but how am I to believe?”

00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:39.349
As if by believing it they are going 
to give some money to Me

00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:41.694
or I don’t know what they are going to give.

00:05:41.894 --> 00:05:45.505
“I can see the vibrations coming, but 
what’s the use of getting the vibrations?

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:47.793
Why did She give us vibrations?”

00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:51.366
Again come back to the gross idea of utility,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.244
because that’s human nature, has been 
so far, to make everything into utility.

00:05:58.637 --> 00:06:02.171
Everything must be utilised, you see.

00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:04.804
Man thinks no end of himself.

00:06:06.554 --> 00:06:11.840
So he starts putting his 
realisation into utility.

00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:15.868
“What utility it has? How many 
people are going to get it?

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.342
What is going to happen? What is the ratio?

00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:21.712
What is the schedule? 
What is this? What is that?”

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:26.738
You have been given this subtleness to enjoy.

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:38.216
Like, if we enjoy the beauty 
of flower, we just enjoy.

00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:42.185
Do we go to the books and 
find out, “What we should do

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.900
about with this enjoyment of ours? 
How to enjoy this flower?”

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:49.470
And then “What to do?” And, 
“Who has described about the flowers,

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.887
so let us see if this is fitting into that?”

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:02.250
But is done very commonly and

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.150
I really don’t know how to say, 
because it’s such a foolish thing.

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:10.719
And I am only afraid that, sometimes, if I say,

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:13.172
they will feel hurt, and, as human beings are,

00:07:13.172 --> 00:07:16.798
they get hurt for nothing at all. 
That’s very foolish.

00:07:16.798 --> 00:07:19.530
Children are very sensible that way.

00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:23.031
Once they get it they start enjoying it. 
They just enjoy it.

00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:25.230
They just sleep off! 
They are not bothered.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.475
They think, that it’s something that 
is to be enjoyed, “Let us enjoy it.”
