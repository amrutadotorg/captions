00:08.450 --> 00:15.962
So, first thing that happens to you is
that your attention becomes subtler.

00:18.541 --> 00:21.483
Attention becoming subtler means

00:25.917 --> 00:30.367
you start understanding deeper things.

00:31.640 --> 00:39.773
For example, a bird can see a flower
but cannot feel the beauty of a flower.

00:44.164 --> 00:51.209
And a unrealised person can see
the beauty of a flower,

00:51.236 --> 00:54.613
but cannot see the vibrations of the flower.

00:57.483 --> 01:04.373
So you become subtler, your
attention becomes subtler.

01:10.586 --> 01:17.590
You definitely are at a higher evolutionary
stage than the other people are.

01:21.589 --> 01:31.115
Now we have to see how we use our attention.

01:37.053 --> 01:41.210
You have seen, even when
you were not realised, that,

01:41.250 --> 01:47.272
supposing you start developing an art

01:47.365 --> 01:50.862
in your hand from your very childhood,

01:52.042 --> 01:59.631
then you develop the deftness
of that particular art,

01:59.731 --> 02:04.074
because a kind of a myelin
sheath grows on the nerves.

02:05.194 --> 02:10.517
In the same way, when you are realised,

02:11.323 --> 02:14.607
I would say when you are a newly born person,

02:15.007 --> 02:18.241
if you start respecting your attention

02:23.857 --> 02:30.489
then gradually you develop
a deftness for Sahaja Yoga.

02:33.198 --> 02:39.246
But so many people, when they get
realised, they hardly come second time.

02:41.179 --> 02:43.995
Even if they come second time,

02:44.968 --> 02:51.760
they do not develop the feeling
of vibrations more,

02:55.823 --> 03:00.748
they still go on being busy with
their day-to-day work,

03:00.748 --> 03:09.050
wasting their attention on things which
do not give you the subtler feeling.

03:14.227 --> 03:31.513
So the subtleness, the deftness of the art
of Sahaja does not develop itself.

03:38.615 --> 03:43.909
For example, I would say a
person who is over-read,

03:45.764 --> 03:53.242
as soon as he gets his realisation he
starts tallying it with what he has read,

03:55.188 --> 03:59.458
this makes his attention again wasted.

03:59.578 --> 04:07.438
As it is, his attention has been
fixed by these conventional ideas;

04:07.505 --> 04:09.573
some of them are correct, some are incorrect,

04:09.613 --> 04:13.290
some are absolutely faulty, some are useless.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.496
Some are only because they
wanted to make money,

04:15.496 --> 04:18.135
they have published some trash.

04:20.870 --> 04:35.283
As soon as you get realisation, you go
back to your own gross awareness

04:35.383 --> 04:40.118
and start tallying this subtle with the gross,

04:44.526 --> 04:47.814
so you start again losing your vibrations.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.270
Actually after getting realisation
I have seen, with small children,

04:52.390 --> 04:56.173
they sleep for very long hours.

04:57.788 --> 05:00.890
They become little inactive for some time.

05:02.951 --> 05:06.170
But if an elder gets it he will
immediately go to the book store,

05:06.257 --> 05:09.925
buy one book on Kundalini and
start reading about it.

05:18.712 --> 05:25.085
Then some of you, not understanding
that you have become somebody else,

05:27.646 --> 05:30.378
take it for granted, “Alright,
Mataji has been very kind;

05:30.458 --> 05:34.428
She says I am far, but how am I to believe?”

05:35.342 --> 05:39.349
As if by believing it they are going
to give some money to Me

05:39.423 --> 05:41.694
or I don’t know what they are going to give.

05:41.894 --> 05:45.505
“I can see the vibrations coming, but
what’s the use of getting the vibrations?

05:45.525 --> 05:47.793
Why did She give us vibrations?”

05:47.793 --> 05:51.366
Again come back to the gross idea of utility,

05:53.040 --> 05:58.244
because that’s human nature, has been
so far, to make everything into utility.

05:58.637 --> 06:02.171
Everything must be utilised, you see.

06:02.251 --> 06:04.804
Man thinks no end of himself.

06:06.554 --> 06:11.840
So he starts putting his
realisation into utility.

06:11.926 --> 06:15.868
“What utility it has? How many
people are going to get it?

06:15.949 --> 06:18.342
What is going to happen? What is the ratio?

06:18.423 --> 06:21.712
What is the schedule?
What is this? What is that?”

06:23.112 --> 06:26.738
You have been given this subtleness to enjoy.

06:29.705 --> 06:38.216
Like, if we enjoy the beauty
of flower, we just enjoy.

06:39.238 --> 06:42.185
Do we go to the books and
find out, “What we should do

06:42.279 --> 06:45.900
about with this enjoyment of ours?
How to enjoy this flower?”

06:45.973 --> 06:49.470
And then “What to do?” And,
“Who has described about the flowers,

06:49.470 --> 06:52.887
so let us see if this is fitting into that?”

07:00.125 --> 07:02.250
But is done very commonly and

07:02.250 --> 07:07.150
I really don’t know how to say,
because it’s such a foolish thing.

07:07.316 --> 07:10.719
And I am only afraid that, sometimes, if I say,

07:10.719 --> 07:13.172
they will feel hurt, and, as human beings are,

07:13.172 --> 07:16.798
they get hurt for nothing at all.
That’s very foolish.

07:16.798 --> 07:19.530
Children are very sensible that way.

07:19.611 --> 07:23.031
Once they get it they start enjoying it.
They just enjoy it.

07:23.031 --> 07:25.230
They just sleep off!
They are not bothered.

07:25.230 --> 07:29.475
They think, that it’s something that
is to be enjoyed, “Let us enjoy it.”
