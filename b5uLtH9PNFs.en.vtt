00:00:01.698 --> 00:00:04.460
So, the religion should be inside.

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:12.404
That's Sufism.

00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:18.012
"Sufi" word comes from "saf" [clean].

00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:24.700
Yogi: Mother, Mr. Emin is teaching
at the Marmara University

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:29.765
and teaching the interpretations
of  Holy Quran.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.432
Good.

00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:31.105
Yes.

00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:34.752
But, you see, Quran also is very had recent.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.713
Sufi : There is a verse in the Quran.

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:40.522
It says that if the people

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:45.331
were abstain of Allah’s prohibitions

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:50.206
and namely, if they followed Allah’s orders,

00:00:50.222 --> 00:00:53.595
if they did not do so (what they did),

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.426
they would experience the abundances
raining down on them from the sky.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.080
That is to say, if they did not break the rules
and if they run the orders of Allah.

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.678
It’s not that way. You see.

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:32.091
Sufi : So I am not sure,

00:01:32.115 --> 00:01:35.331
Yes if they believed, if they believed

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:38.174
and didn’t break the rules

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:57.208
Sufi : They would see the gates of abundance
in the sky is going to open for them.

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:08.283
To whom?

00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:10.037
Yogi: To the people.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:14.589
Yogi: To those who are following the rules,
those who are  following strickly the Quran.

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:18.234
There’s no doubt about it.
But what I feel about the whole thing is that

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:24.742
that Koran was written after forty years
of  death of Muhammad Sahib.

00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:34.574
And also-

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.756
Sufi :Not, no, He wrote it in his lifetime

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.257
and you cannot remember.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.332
But despite that, I find Quran is perfect.

00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:47.780
But there are many subtler things that are missing.

00:02:57.405 --> 00:03:04.472
Now, for example, Muhammad Sahib
has said that he went on a white horse,

00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:06.507
through the seven heavens.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.268
Now that people don't understand.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.985
Sufi : They don’t understand.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.686
So, that is the, he has described
exactly what happens

00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:26.758
when the Kundalini rises.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.948
Sufi :In fact, there is no one
who goes or comes.

00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:31.496
He hasn’t gone anywhere.

00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:32.641
What he says?

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:37.893
Yogi: He says that actually,
he is not travelling somewhere

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.736
No, no, no, it is within yourself.

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.779
Sufi : By conquering worlds within Himself.

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:44.549
Within yourself, he crosses.

00:03:44.573 --> 00:03:47.152
Sufi : That Miraj (ascend) is a completely spiritual event.

00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:49.678
Yes, but that is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.676
That is what, yes.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.700
Sufi :The same, the same

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:57.588
But what has happened that
because of poetry,

00:03:57.835 --> 00:03:59.835
as people don't understand.

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:07.413
And they are misinterpreting.
Mainly, they are misinterpreting.

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.565
Sufi : No, people are searching the religion outside.

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.802
That's the point.

00:04:21.507 --> 00:04:24.518
That's the point. But what he has said -

00:04:24.543 --> 00:04:26.502
Sufi :But mystics (Sufi masters) know

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:29.340
that it is a spiritual journey.

00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:41.406
Yes, of course. But the trouble is people
don't understand and they are misled.

00:04:47.232 --> 00:04:49.867
Because people want to
make money out of them.

00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:57.811
Or they want to gain some sort of
a violence or something

00:04:57.844 --> 00:05:02.065
and they are just bringing a bad name
to Kuran-ı Şerif (Holy Quran)

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:04.636
and also to Muhammad Sahib.

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:26.349
Sufi : But this spiritual journey is not
the problem of all 1.5 billion Muslims.

00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:34.864
Every person can not return to their inner world
and experience that miracle anyway.

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:40.743
Sufi : So, this is not the problem
of the common people.

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:51.195
That's it.

00:05:51.243 --> 00:05:53.721
Sufi :We call them as havas (eminent people), Sufi

00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:59.842
That's true. That is the main thing
that we talk about in Sahaja Yoga

00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:03.900
that, "You know thyself" is said in the Quran also.

00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:09.546
Sufi : Same in all.

00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:13.770
So, when you have not known yourself,
you are not a muselman.

00:06:18.285 --> 00:06:22.445
Without knowing yourself,
what are you surrendering to God?

00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:32.187
It's an important thing
that first you know yourself.

00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:39.188
Can you believe that all religions
have said the same thing?

00:06:42.338 --> 00:06:46.019
Christ has said the same,
Krishna has said the same,

00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:49.731
Rama has said the same,
Zoroaster has said the same thing

00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:53.074
all of them have said the same thing.

00:06:57.082 --> 00:07:00.661
Sufi :Krishna is more closer to Prophet Adam.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:06.658
Sufi :He is more closer to
the Probhet Adam, to the first religion.

00:07:14.461 --> 00:07:16.613
But Adam, they did not know "Ruh".

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:22.420
Sufi :No, none of them wrote,
their successors also did not write.

00:07:22.896 --> 00:07:25.940
The poets of that time did not write books either.

00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:43.008
True, I agree. But, you see, whether
it is Krishna or anyone of these people,

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:46.516
they are all just the same.

00:07:46.548 --> 00:07:53.888
And they are building up human beings
to find out about themselves.

00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:03.957
And also, Sufis are like that.

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:08.240
Sufi :There is no such thing in current education also.

00:08:08.265 --> 00:08:12.923
We know the (material)things, but when it comes to
knowing the human being, nobody knows anything.

00:08:12.948 --> 00:08:18.114
So the education in the most advanced
countries, what is taught in schools,

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.656
you can tell,

00:08:20.677 --> 00:08:25.621
there is nothing also there
for a human being to know himself.

00:08:25.636 --> 00:08:28.977
There is ethics, there are a
set of outwardly rules.

00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:31.940
You won’t pick your nose, you won’t spit
to the ground or something like that

00:08:31.965 --> 00:08:34.424
but it doesn’t give any information
about our inner world,

00:08:34.449 --> 00:08:37.012
and today’s modern education
also does not give anything.

00:08:44.334 --> 00:08:50.205
Yes, correct. I agree with you.
But it was outside was worked out, I don't know.

00:08:51.554 --> 00:08:55.472
But it has to be worked out inside.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.338
Because, when it is worked inside,

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:07.206
as it is said that, "At the time
of "Qiyamah" [Resurrection],

00:09:07.236 --> 00:09:10.952
your hands will speak" and they speak actually.

00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:20.778
So, by outside -

00:09:20.803 --> 00:09:24.492
Sufi :Presently speaking also

00:09:25.696 --> 00:09:27.634
Sufi :Presently speaking also

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.159
Haa?

00:09:37.214 --> 00:09:42.304
Ah, that's the thing, but they are
very few and they are the Sufis.

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:49.401
Sufi :Here it is speaking
but there is no one who is listening.

00:09:56.562 --> 00:10:01.434
Also, you should know what do
they mean, what are they saying.

00:10:05.098 --> 00:10:08.202
And that is what is explained in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:14.344 --> 00:10:16.527
You can verify it.

00:10:19.262 --> 00:10:21.683
Sufi :Rumi has a saying.

00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:23.217
He is Mevlevi by the way.

00:10:23.242 --> 00:10:23.925
Hum?

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.582
He is from the part of Mevlevi, Mevlana.

00:10:27.607 --> 00:10:29.892
Yogi: Jalaladdin Rumi.

00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:32.066
Yogi: Whirling dervish.

00:10:32.543 --> 00:10:35.550
Sufi :He says; while in a commune.

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:36.871
He says…

00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:39.851
But he also didn't say how you become,

00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:44.394
Sufi : Myself ?

00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:45.447
how, what to do-

00:10:45.472 --> 00:10:46.891
Sufi : It is a long journey.

00:10:46.931 --> 00:10:49.851
You see, whatever he was, he was great.

00:10:49.876 --> 00:10:54.875
And he has written about his own
understanding and feelings.

00:10:54.907 --> 00:11:00.707
He should tell you about his feelings,
how he became Mevlevi?

00:11:00.732 --> 00:11:02.138
He didn't say that.

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:07.024
Yogi: No, he says that Mevlana,
he didn’t explain openly how to become.

00:11:07.049 --> 00:11:08.578
No, no, no, he didn't, he didn't.

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:09.458
He didn't.

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:16.643
I agree, what he has done, he said is- what is
has talked that after becoming a Realized soul,

00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:21.112
what you think what you talk

00:11:21.137 --> 00:11:30.649
and it's like, you can say, the Chinese
system of Tao, same thing, same thing.

00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:38.161
Tao also is a system in which he describes
what happens to a person who is a Tao.

00:11:38.733 --> 00:11:41.085
The one who is a Realized soul,

00:11:41.164 --> 00:11:45.457
what happens to him?
How he is above everything,

00:11:45.482 --> 00:11:48.932
how he works out, how he has no fear.

00:11:48.957 --> 00:11:54.263
But that is what you are saying how it is.

00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:57.510
But how to achieve it? They never told.

00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:10.455
Sufi : They elucidate, they elucidate.
It is in Masnavi (Rumi’s book).

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.253
How human beings achieve it?

00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:17.941
And that too, collectively.

00:12:24.523 --> 00:12:30.079
Sufi :It is difficult for communities to reach,

00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:34.364
because first of all, something has to
happen, people have to have a desire,

00:12:34.372 --> 00:12:36.661
all those people in these communities,

00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:41.614
these society’s desire is for worldly
blessings, worldly pleasures.

00:12:51.755 --> 00:12:55.686
No, no, no. Not now.
Now it's a different thing.

00:12:55.711 --> 00:13:00.165
Because the world is so much full of
struggle and strive and all that.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.623
This has started.

00:13:16.968 --> 00:13:22.758
All over the world,
there are thousands of people-

00:13:22.783 --> 00:13:24.997
Sufi :It was the same at his time also.
There was war at the time of Rumi also.

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:29.203
The Mongols were coming by
invading all the Turkish provinces.

00:13:29.214 --> 00:13:32.359
Rumi also came to Konya
because he escaped from war.

00:13:44.172 --> 00:13:51.209
But this is a special time. It's already
predicted in our scriptures also.

00:13:52.308 --> 00:13:59.300
In Indian scriptures, that this is the time where
people will get their Self-realization collectively.

00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:12.631
In your Italy only, in your country only,
there are so many who have got it.

00:14:21.782 --> 00:14:26.278
Sufi :Turkey has a different situation
from other Islamic countries.

00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:30.322
It is the Sufi culture that keeps Islam alive in us.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.170
Sufi :I mean, it is very different from
Saudi Arabia, even from Egypt,

00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:42.924
Libya, and African countries.

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:46.341
But one Sufi cannot make others Sufis, it's the point.

00:14:53.731 --> 00:14:56.830
But in Sahaja Yoga, we can make thousands.

00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:06.863
Sufi : As those dervish lodges are closed nowadays,
it is possible to talk about everything.

00:15:06.888 --> 00:15:10.734
They were doing this.
They didn’t, but they all have a tread , a tree.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:14.744
So it goes as an upward interaction.
For example, a person leaves

00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:19.360
10 successor behind him, his thing is
looking after  these successors.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.793
There were thousands of dervish lodges.

00:15:20.818 --> 00:15:23.848
When only Istanbul had
a population of 500 thousand,

00:15:23.873 --> 00:15:27.479
that half of it was Muslim at that time.

00:15:40.674 --> 00:15:43.276
Sufi : There were 520 dervish lodges.

00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:52.706
I know, I know that's why
it's so important for me.

00:15:55.812 --> 00:16:02.383
But to give it collectively and to give
the pure knowledge is very important.

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:14.332
Sufi : To give this to the masses,
you can give culture to the masses,

00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:17.221
but you cannot make them Sufis.
In order to become a Sufi,

00:16:17.246 --> 00:16:20.460
you also need education and a doctrine.

00:16:20.485 --> 00:16:26.309
So now, you can give a lot of hygiene information
a person, you can give a health culture to the masses,

00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:30.364
but you cannot bring up an ear specialist
from among the masses.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:32.692
This is a special education
like a medicine course.

00:16:32.717 --> 00:16:35.898
Yogi: Mr Emin, now Shri Mataji is also
trying to explain this,

00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:39.900
how do you convey this information to people?

00:16:39.925 --> 00:16:44.654
Sufi : You give a superficial culture,
but it will be very shallow.

00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:50.355
Yes, you can teach a little avoidance of sin,
a little self-care etc.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.598
It’s like to teach how to avoid of microbe,
hygenie culture or something like this.

00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:59.737
It's spontaneous awaking, without effort.

00:16:59.762 --> 00:17:02.399
It's not  coming from the brain, it's coming from inside

00:17:02.424 --> 00:17:06.600
and it is happening in no time, like this.

00:17:07.624 --> 00:17:12.046
Yogi :Now there is a small difference there
that needs to be captured

00:17:12.063 --> 00:17:16.741
Sahaja Yoga does not say anything different
from Islam in terms of knowledge and sayings.

00:17:16.766 --> 00:17:20.737
Sufi :No, I’m not saying it’s different,
now the big crowds…

00:17:20.745 --> 00:17:21.953
Yogi: That is what I am trying to mention..

00:17:21.978 --> 00:17:26.699
Sufi :… There is no such thing
as making the people like Sufis,

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:28.297
that is, raising thousands,
hundreds of thousands Rumis.

00:17:28.326 --> 00:17:32.818
Even the prophet cannot make
his believers like a prophet,

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:35.826
but He brings up them to a certain point.

00:17:35.851 --> 00:17:38.923
Alis  were brought up,
Abu Bakr was brought up

00:17:38.948 --> 00:17:42.771
but then people  leave.
Then there’s a thing,

00:17:42.796 --> 00:17:47.825
that’s breaking loose from the impact of the
dissipation Source when you get away from it .

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.664
Prophet Abraham was a prophet
and Ishmael was his son.

00:17:51.688 --> 00:17:54.776
Both of them were devoted to Allah,

00:17:54.801 --> 00:17:59.113
but it says in the Qur’an that,
a time came and their children

00:17:59.138 --> 00:18:02.442
abandoned salaat,
abandoned worship

00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:06.581
and fell into sin,
and took the ill way .

00:18:06.898 --> 00:18:10.487
Yogini: Now Shri Mataji knows
all of them too, She will tell you a system,

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:13.051
if you will excuse us,
She will tell you how.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:16.690
Sufi :You are welcome, no,
this is not the work of the crowds.

00:18:16.715 --> 00:18:19.422
This is the education of those
who are willing very much,

00:18:19.447 --> 00:18:22.655
very ambitious and believes in this work,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.348
who are fully committed themselves to this work,

00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:30.927
but we can just give its culture with
the current communication tools.

00:18:30.952 --> 00:18:34.456
If Rumi had television,

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:38.936
he could have reached thousands of people,
not just fifteen or twenty people.

00:18:38.961 --> 00:18:45.401
Yogi: In Sahaja Yoga, we don't need to do
big penances, tapasya, dancing, this and that.

00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:47.210
It is just a spontaneous happening.

00:18:47.218 --> 00:18:50.236
In her presence, the Kundalini awakens,

00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:52.963
goes up and we get this enlightenment.

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:58.058
And then the full knowledge of Muhammad,
Jesus, come to us spontaneously.

00:18:58.083 --> 00:19:00.588
Complete, absolute.

00:19:02.937 --> 00:19:06.095
Yogi: Now what you said…

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.881
Yogi: Without effort.

00:19:06.906 --> 00:19:12.056
Yogi: This is the intellectual
part of it. Information, cultures,

00:19:12.081 --> 00:19:15.381
that can be told
on television is purely a mental job.

00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:19.206
In the presence of Shri Mataji,

00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:21.908
with the awakening of the inner energy

00:19:21.933 --> 00:19:25.401
that is called Kundalini,

00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:29.344
one gets this knowledge spontaneously

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:33.616
in a second and automatically.

00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:50.270
If there is no pure desire, this is not
going to happen in a person anyway.

00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:53.427
You are right there,

00:19:53.452 --> 00:19:56.049
but everyone who has that desire is experiencing

00:19:56.076 --> 00:20:01.207
a spontaneous awakening thanks to Shri Mataji’s Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:01.232 --> 00:20:08.204
and we can call this state as enlightenment, that occurs with the awakening of this energy

00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:10.732
that we call kundalini,

00:20:10.757 --> 00:20:13.893
when the person experiences this energetic enlightenment,

00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:18.344
it is much easier to absorb information.

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:25.006
Shri Mataji has been saying persistently in this period, for years, in the world,

00:20:25.031 --> 00:20:30.537
this is a the case in all teachings, in Sufism, in different Hindu teachings,

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:33.716
in other deep spiritual knowledge,

00:20:33.741 --> 00:20:35.941
there is an elite people

00:20:35.966 --> 00:20:38.596
and only this people can reach it

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:40.346
and the masses cannot.

00:20:40.378 --> 00:20:42.107
Shri Mataji claims the opposite.

00:20:42.132 --> 00:20:43.307
Sufi : She, herself said something,

00:20:43.332 --> 00:20:47.265
our Master, the Prophet told about
the spiritual ascension,

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.317
but those who listened to Him,
they understand it as,

00:20:50.342 --> 00:20:54.861
He got on the white horse and elevated,
and flew away to the sky in real,

00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:56.363
while the Prophet was still alive.

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:57.427
Yogi: Anyway…

00:20:57.452 --> 00:20:59.794
Sufi : So there is no such thing
as everyone gets it right way.

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:03.526
In thousands, all over the world,
they just put the hands like this

00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:04.987
and the get awakened.

00:21:05.012 --> 00:21:07.392
They see, ou see, their eyes sparkling.

00:21:07.411 --> 00:21:10.569
Sufi : I do not object to what She said.

00:21:10.594 --> 00:21:13.082
I’m trying to explain
that issue is very difficult.

00:21:13.107 --> 00:21:18.490
What, Shri Mataji, he is trying
to tell us is that it's not to

00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:21.371
to  come against what we are saying,

00:21:21.387 --> 00:21:23.676
it's just that from his knowledge,

00:21:23.701 --> 00:21:26.375
But he is a Sufi and he is my son.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.602
From his knowledge, what he thinks that
it is very difficult because he doesn't know.

00:21:31.627 --> 00:21:34.372
Ah, yes. It used to be not now

00:21:35.941 --> 00:21:38.718
Sufi : I am a professor at the faculty.

00:21:38.877 --> 00:21:41.797
I have been teaching children for 4 years.

00:21:41.847 --> 00:21:46.437
Let’s say in a class of
80 people for example,

00:21:46.557 --> 00:21:52.912
8 of them   understand me
as a eleve at the end of four years,

00:21:53.032 --> 00:21:55.113
70 of them still do not.

00:22:10.597 --> 00:22:14.983
No, you go the other way round.
Sahaja Yoga is the other way round.

00:22:15.008 --> 00:22:19.003
First, we make them the Sufis
and then we give them the Quran.

00:22:19.028 --> 00:22:25.515
Şimdi Sahaja Yogada tek teknik farklı
diyor anlayış farkı olmasa bile,

00:22:25.526 --> 00:22:30.538
Yogi: Now even though there is no difference
in understanding in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:30.563 --> 00:22:34.191
but let’s just say the technique is different. First,
this enlightenment is experienced by the presence

00:22:34.221 --> 00:22:36.021
and teachings of Shri Mataji and knowledge
comes after this. There is no enlightenment

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.625
with knowledge, but first enlightenment
with energy, enlightenment with Kundalini,

00:22:39.681 --> 00:22:44.316
and then giving information to the people
who attained the enlightenment.

00:22:44.333 --> 00:22:45.531
That's the way it is.

00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:48.753
Sufi : I understand,
I understand what She is saying.

00:22:48.795 --> 00:22:51.213
Now, for example, it comes to my mind
and now I ask them, for example,

00:22:51.301 --> 00:22:53.565
She herself is Hindu.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.379
Yogi: She is not, She is not

00:22:54.404 --> 00:22:55.959
Sufi :In India too, this Lady…, sir,

00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:57.768
Yogi: She is not Hindu

00:22:57.777 --> 00:23:00.535
Yogi: Her origin,
She was born as a Christian,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.282
but She is very deep in these teachings…..

00:23:03.321 --> 00:23:05.700
Sufi :I mean, She is from India, isn’t She?

00:23:05.725 --> 00:23:06.416
Yogi: She is from India.

00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:07.273
Sufi : Alright.

00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:11.065
Yogi: Only after the awakening,
the scriptures can be understood.

00:23:13.002 --> 00:23:15.017
Sufi : Isn’t She from India?

00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:17.251
Şimdi kendi dilini bildiği

00:23:17.253 --> 00:23:20.195
How effective can She be in a society

00:23:20.216 --> 00:23:24.741
where She knows it’s language and culture?

00:23:24.829 --> 00:23:26.340
Yogi: It’s going very fast right now.

00:23:26.356 --> 00:23:29.034
Forget about India,
This is happening in the whole world.

00:23:29.058 --> 00:23:32.121
In other words, when you go,
you may encounter millions,

00:23:32.134 --> 00:23:34.531
hundreds of thousands…

00:23:34.556 --> 00:23:37.033
Sufi : No, now I am not talking
about partisans, She has got a lot of fans,

00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:40.122
I also sympathize to Her, for example, this is something
like, I read this book and oh it’s a good thing.

00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:46.861
When she gave conferences, many professors,
university professors, teachers of Quran,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.672
they came to Shri Mataji and they said,

00:23:48.697 --> 00:23:51.899
"The way you explain, Shri Mataji, the Quran,

00:23:51.902 --> 00:23:54.415
it was never understood before" and never had...

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.111
Fundamentalist, so many fundamentalists.

00:23:57.136 --> 00:24:00.013
Yogi: I remember on thing in Delhi…

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:04.300
First, you give them the experience
of the All-pervading Power of "Ruh".

00:24:04.325 --> 00:24:08.891
Once they get the experience,
then they go deep.

00:24:37.631 --> 00:24:39.749
Sufi : So you first open the door,

00:24:39.774 --> 00:24:42.551
then turn on the lamp and
put things in order.

00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:43.440
Yogi: Exactly.

00:24:53.786 --> 00:24:56.944
Sufi :But not every door
opens easily tough.

00:24:56.983 --> 00:24:58.944
The lock is getting rusty.

00:25:04.293 --> 00:25:05.844
But Shri Mataji has the key.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.706
To all the doors.

00:25:10.857 --> 00:25:13.161
She has the master key.

00:25:13.202 --> 00:25:16.567
Sufi: She has taken on a very high mission.

00:25:16.992 --> 00:25:19.801
This is not the job of every brave person.

00:25:19.912 --> 00:25:22.599
I hope this will be useful and successful.

00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:23.916
So we pray to Her,

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.898
He has to get many Sufis.

00:25:37.274 --> 00:25:42.739
If you want to change the world,
you can't manage with one or two.

00:25:51.287 --> 00:25:57.247
Even to understand Quran or Bible or
anything, you have to have that eyes.

00:26:09.057 --> 00:26:15.801
In Sahaja Yoga also, also "vidya" [knowledge],

00:26:17.199 --> 00:26:22.511
is what are all the centres are there,
what are the problems of the centres.

00:26:22.558 --> 00:26:28.612
And we have seen that people
have cured physically, mentally.

00:26:28.637 --> 00:26:33.936
And also, they become what they call,
thoughtlessly aware.

00:26:47.181 --> 00:26:49.720
So, all the religions have talked about it.

00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:56.346
It's not only Quran, it's not only Bible,
it's not only Gita.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.358
All the religions have said the same thing.

00:27:00.383 --> 00:27:03.573
Sufi : You will solve the problems,
spiritual problems.

00:27:06.437 --> 00:27:07.595
What she said?

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.905
She is asking, "How is that possible?"

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:16.891
It’s possible because God has made
within us all the arrangements.

00:27:16.916 --> 00:27:19.189
He is a great organizer.

00:27:24.242 --> 00:27:29.493
And we have within us that power
that's the Mother Power

00:27:29.518 --> 00:27:34.087
which rises and pierces through your
fontanelle bone area

00:27:34.112 --> 00:27:39.885
and makes you one connection with
that All-pervading Power, the "Ruh"

00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:59.568
Yogi: Excuse me, here in Sufizm, also
there is a terminology for that moment.

00:27:59.593 --> 00:28:03.087
It is called “Enel Hak”
[I am the Truth or I am not far from God]

00:28:03.112 --> 00:28:04.966
In this religion.

00:28:04.991 --> 00:28:10.160
"Ana al-Haqq", saying, I am God.
Saying, I am God.

00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:11.220
I am religion.

00:28:11.245 --> 00:28:13.014
Yogi: I am religion, I am God.

00:28:13.574 --> 00:28:16.367
Sufi : No, this is not meant I am God

00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:20.242
Yogi: In other words, I am a part of whole,
a part of God. I am also part of God.

00:28:20.267 --> 00:28:21.244
Sufi : He says, I’m the truth.

00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:23.357
You become, actually you become...

00:28:23.382 --> 00:28:24.645
Yes, the Truth. I am the Truth.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.235
You become.
You don't have to have a certificate.

00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:30.132
You just become.
First, your hands start speaking.

00:28:30.461 --> 00:28:33.185
You know what are
these centers are within you.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:38.951
Every knowledge, perfect
knowledge within is available.
