WEBVTT

00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:04.549
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:12.810
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:32.540
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoying
it very much.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:43.290
Today being the first puja in Maharashtra,
we'll have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:54.660
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharashtra
that people worship Ganesha.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:26:06.930
As you know there are Ashtavinayakas, eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:17.030
Maharashtra which has got on one side one big
mountain,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:23.890
on the other side, we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharashtra.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.059
And also, on top, we have another mountain.

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:36.720
So, like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara,
means the Kundalini itself.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.410
So, the Kundalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:47.510
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharashtra, as the country which is very

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.160
great, the nation which is very great.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:27:01.600
But I don’t know how far Maharashtrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharashtra.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:17.450
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:23.350
a different style, a different type.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:34.760
The best part of Maharashtra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:46.889
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

00:27:46.889 --> 00:27:56.740
helps you in so many ways. And that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:03.700
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.460
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:20.779
For Ganesha is actually the one who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:28.940
is innocence. And the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.669
and egos that are distracting your attention.

00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:42.290
So, the attention which is so wobbly otherwise,
in other places, can settle down very well

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:51.430
in Maharashtra. Because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:55.240
have very good attention.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:03.860
With that good attention, they can really do
so many things. Like now, for example, you

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.520
can see the software,

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.839
good mathematics.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:16.090
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:26.289
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:30.440
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.500
He’s a giver of wisdom.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.940
means just wisdom becomes a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.810
You become just wise.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.169
Now somebody may ask, "Mother how to become
wise?"

00:29:43.169 --> 00:29:46.560
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.320
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.849
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

00:29:53.849 --> 00:29:55.750
He’s so wise.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:08.429
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

00:30:08.429 --> 00:30:14.549
who is a Sahaja Yogi. Because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:22.310
So, he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:33.470
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:37.259
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:40.329
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:40.329 --> 00:30:43.780
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:53.380
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
innately built-in.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:00.000
Only thing is, we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.429
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:06.889
what is wisdom is.

00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:10.159
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:13.459
You give up all your attachments.

00:31:13.459 --> 00:31:19.199
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

00:31:19.199 --> 00:31:22.600
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.590
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just happens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.079
what is not needed.

00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:32.890
In that wisdom, you throw away whatever is
wrong.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:39.840
So, that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves!

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.169
This manifestation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think. Not that it is only

00:31:46.169 --> 00:31:53.050
the basis, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:32:01.970
That’s why I have been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our children.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:06.160
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.720
Tattwa is already there.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.810
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.959
Once that happens then children are safe.

00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:18.819
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

00:32:18.819 --> 00:32:21.840
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.970
They will never be again in the wrong path.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:32.199
But from early childhood, if you never had
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

00:32:32.199 --> 00:32:41.239
about Kundalini or about the wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate it.

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:48.989
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:51.269
It’s so beauti-ful.

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:56.620
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:02.649
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:08.319
very wise and I can see the wisdom written large
on their faces.

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:19.669
In this wisdom, what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:28.880
most of our problems are coming from human
beings. Because ecological problem, or any

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.540
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:39.269
Or other problems that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:44.160
problems that it’s sort of endless and you
cannot change them.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.589
You feel very nice sitting underneath this,
because you are fed up with the same ways that you have and

00:33:49.589 --> 00:33:58.240
the problems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:10.120
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the wisdom plays such a part in life,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:16.599
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:21.740
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.430
You change within.

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:32.380
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected of others,

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:39.130
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.440
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:49.480
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.969
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:56.719
You know practically everything.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.199
I don’t have to tell you anything.

00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:05.699
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:15.620
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.920
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:26.560
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.519
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:40.969
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:45.039
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

00:35:45.039 --> 00:35:50.310
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:56.050
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.079
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:04.719
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:07.550
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.940
He doesn’t have to question anything.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.339
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:14.120
He is just there.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.889
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:26.409
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:28.599
about things, nothing of the kind.

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:33.570
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:41.889
Small, small stories can show you how He was
so sure of himself, how He had courage and

00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:48.340
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.870
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:37:00.310
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.519
what is to be done. Like that [straight].
This is the point.

00:37:03.519 --> 00:37:06.240
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.750
I’ve seen many people who say, "Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:19.110
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out".

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:23.089
Now, I must say this is a state.

00:37:23.089 --> 00:37:28.380
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.639
Means you are there.

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:35.789
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

00:37:35.789 --> 00:37:45.329
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:50.860
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:57.730
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:05.950
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:15.180
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.420
He’s a thief now.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.279
What should you do with a thief?

00:38:20.279 --> 00:38:26.260
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:32.800
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:39.469
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget. Not to worry about it too much, "Oh,

00:38:39.469 --> 00:38:46.969
this has happened, that has happened. And how
to make this point all right? And this gentleman

00:38:46.969 --> 00:38:48.969
is not all right.This, that".

00:38:48.969 --> 00:38:56.599
Just forget it.
So, the wisdom is also in forgiving.

00:38:56.599 --> 00:39:00.579
That why Christ talked about forgiveness.
Just forgive.

00:39:00.579 --> 00:39:04.009
There’s no sense in remembering.

00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:07.500
"This person said so, this person did so, that
happened".

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:12.670
So, just forget it. And once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.380
right things and useless things you’ll just
forgive.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:23.029
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has been misbehaving.

00:39:23.029 --> 00:39:27.519
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about me

00:39:27.519 --> 00:39:29.170
saying things, this, that.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.339
It’s all right.

00:39:30.339 --> 00:39:33.930
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:39.069
But what bothers me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen to them.

00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:44.671
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone, I say,

00:39:44.671 --> 00:39:47.300
"Baba, I have nothing to say".

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:52.280
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.060
to happen to them?

00:39:54.060 --> 00:40:02.190
They’re doing this to someone who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.180
in spiritual life.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.440
Then you can’t play about. But somebody is
playing! Then what you have to do is to really

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:15.670
forgive because one thing is built-in, in Sahaja
Yoga, that who try to trouble you, they will

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:20.469
be in trouble also.
So, try to forgive at least. At least, you soothe him down,

00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:21.800
"All right, I forgive you".

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.400
So, soothe him down.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.529
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

00:40:30.529 --> 00:40:42.190
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of pursue, I should say, pursue the matter.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:46.620
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.370
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.810
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.259
You know he steals your money.

00:40:56.259 --> 00:41:00.719
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:01.719
out.

00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:02.839
Then you have another one.

00:41:02.839 --> 00:41:05.449
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

00:41:05.449 --> 00:41:12.180
It goes on like that because they’re poor people, they just steal if they get.
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:18.079
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:20.180
that he cannot reach.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.710
Finished.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.159
As simple as this.

00:41:23.159 --> 00:41:27.839
You should just find out what does he steal.

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:29.580
Oh, that’s all.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:36.349
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:43.070
"Now, how am I to save myself from this thief?
Or, how am I to punish him?" Just don’t think.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:48.389
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
and going.

00:41:48.389 --> 00:41:50.880
These relationships are just like that.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.519
There’s no depth in it.

00:41:52.519 --> 00:42:00.569
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:05.890
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.910
The wisdom is in living in the present.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:12.539
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

00:42:12.539 --> 00:42:17.919
Now, if I say, "Forget the past", one may say,
"How to do it? How to forget the past?"

00:42:17.919 --> 00:42:22.049
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

00:42:22.049 --> 00:42:28.150
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in the centre,

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:34.669
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

00:42:34.669 --> 00:42:45.470
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.789
getting after someone.

00:42:49.789 --> 00:42:55.179
Where is the time? Just think like that.

00:42:55.179 --> 00:43:00.809
Now supposing someone says something to me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

00:43:00.809 --> 00:43:01.809
do something about it.

00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:03.419
You must punish that person.

00:43:03.419 --> 00:43:13.230
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:21.480
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So, our wisdom is finished.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.900
We have no wisdom at all.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.990
Even at the highest level, you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:44.319
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:51.210
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sannyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.210
there happily.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.850
There’s no wisdom in that also.

00:43:54.850 --> 00:44:00.140
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:06.730
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:11.909
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything. And that’s

00:44:11.909 --> 00:44:19.600
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:30.040
So, this wisdom is to live in the present.
It's now that you ask somebody, "How are you?"

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.330
"All right [means not good]".

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:34.650
Then, he is not in the present.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:40.750
You ask somebody, "Are you enjoying yourself?"
[Not much] Not in the present.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:46.240
You ask somebody, "Are you happy?" "No".

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.260
Then you are not in the present.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:56.950
You ask someone that, "Are you hungry?" "Maybe,
may not be".

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:02.850
I mean, they don’t know, even in the present,
if they are hungry or not.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:07.990
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.540
of unwise behavior, unwise line,

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:16.510
if they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:22.390
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:26.980
They’re just in the present. And in the present,
whatever they have to do, they will do it.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.980
This is a very good practice.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:35.350
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:39.220
Just think, "What I have to do just now? What
am I to do".

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.620
Like you are getting out of the house.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:48.240
Many people will go half way, "Oh, my God!
I have left my passport".

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.200
They’ll go back.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.720
Then again, some time they will come out.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.680
"My God, I have left my spectacles".

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.310
Again go back.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.330
Then again they will come back and say, "I
have lost this.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:00.400
I should have this".

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.550
This kind of people are very, very common.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:08.400
So, at that time when you are leaving the house,
at that time, if you are in the

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.330
present, then you just think, "What have I
to take? Let's see, one, two, three, four,

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:15.530
five, yes.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.929
This is is what I have to take and this
there".

00:46:18.929 --> 00:46:29.939
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom itself. Means, the wisdom acts by itself.

00:46:29.939 --> 00:46:31.520
It’s a power.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.789
Wisdom is a very big power.

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:36.160
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:42.409
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

00:46:42.409 --> 00:46:49.640
It’s such a tremendous power that God has
given us, that we are wise. And this wisdom,

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:58.080
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly, within ourselves.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.450
So, today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:06.680
while we should ask for wisdom. And for that,
we have to be in the present.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.679
Every way, you should be in the present.

00:47:10.679 --> 00:47:17.580
If you can try, you can be, because your Kundalini
has been awakened, and you can be all the time

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:27.220
in the present. But today, you should first
try and get the Kundalini established in the

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.850
present.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.390
May God bless you.
