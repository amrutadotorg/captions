WEBVTT

00:24:54.782 --> 00:25:04.711
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:12.972
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

00:25:12.972 --> 00:25:32.702
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoying
it very much.

00:25:32.702 --> 00:25:43.452
Today being the first puja in Maharashtra,
we'll have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

00:25:43.452 --> 00:25:54.822
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharashtra
that people worship Ganesha.

00:25:54.822 --> 00:26:07.092
As you know there are Ashtavinayakas, eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

00:26:07.092 --> 00:26:17.192
Maharashtra which has got on one side one big
mountain,

00:26:17.192 --> 00:26:24.052
on the other side, we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharashtra.

00:26:24.052 --> 00:26:26.221
And also, on top, we have another mountain.

00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:36.882
So, like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara,
means the Kundalini itself.

00:26:36.882 --> 00:26:40.572
So, the Kundalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

00:26:40.572 --> 00:26:47.672
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharashtra, as the country which is very

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:50.322
great, the nation which is very great.

00:26:50.322 --> 00:27:01.762
But I don’t know how far Maharashtrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharashtra.

00:27:01.762 --> 00:27:17.612
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

00:27:17.612 --> 00:27:23.512
a different style, a different type.

00:27:23.512 --> 00:27:34.922
The best part of Maharashtra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

00:27:34.922 --> 00:27:47.051
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

00:27:47.051 --> 00:27:56.902
helps you in so many ways. And that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

00:27:56.902 --> 00:28:03.862
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

00:28:03.862 --> 00:28:08.622
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

00:28:08.622 --> 00:28:20.941
For Ganesha is actually the one who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:29.102
is innocence. And the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

00:28:29.102 --> 00:28:34.831
and egos that are distracting your attention.

00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:42.452
So, the attention which is so wobbly otherwise,
in other places, can settle down very well

00:28:42.452 --> 00:28:51.592
in Maharashtra. Because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

00:28:51.592 --> 00:28:55.402
have very good attention.

00:28:55.402 --> 00:29:04.022
With that good attention, they can really do
so many things. Like now, for example, you

00:29:04.022 --> 00:29:06.682
can see the software,

00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:08.001
good mathematics.

00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:16.252
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

00:29:16.252 --> 00:29:26.451
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:30.602
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:33.662
He’s a giver of wisdom.

00:29:33.662 --> 00:29:39.102
means just wisdom becomes a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

00:29:39.102 --> 00:29:40.972
You become just wise.

00:29:40.972 --> 00:29:43.331
Now somebody may ask, "Mother how to become
wise?"

00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:46.722
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:50.482
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

00:29:50.482 --> 00:29:54.011
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:55.912
He’s so wise.

00:29:55.912 --> 00:30:08.591
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:14.711
who is a Sahaja Yogi. Because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:22.472
So, he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

00:30:22.472 --> 00:30:33.632
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

00:30:33.632 --> 00:30:37.421
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:40.491
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:40.491 --> 00:30:43.942
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:53.542
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
innately built-in.

00:30:53.542 --> 00:31:00.162
Only thing is, we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:05.591
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:07.051
what is wisdom is.

00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:10.321
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

00:31:10.321 --> 00:31:13.621
You give up all your attachments.

00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:19.361
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:22.762
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

00:31:22.762 --> 00:31:28.752
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just happens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

00:31:28.752 --> 00:31:30.241
what is not needed.

00:31:30.241 --> 00:31:33.052
In that wisdom, you throw away whatever is
wrong.

00:31:33.052 --> 00:31:40.002
So, that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves!

00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:46.331
This manifestation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think. Not that it is only

00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:53.212
the basis, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

00:31:53.222 --> 00:32:02.132
That’s why I have been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our children.

00:32:02.132 --> 00:32:06.322
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

00:32:06.322 --> 00:32:07.882
Tattwa is already there.

00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:12.972
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:16.121
Once that happens then children are safe.

00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:18.981
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

00:32:18.981 --> 00:32:22.002
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

00:32:22.002 --> 00:32:26.132
They will never be again in the wrong path.

00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:32.361
But from early childhood, if you never had
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:41.401
about Kundalini or about the wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate it.

00:32:41.431 --> 00:32:49.151
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

00:32:49.151 --> 00:32:51.431
It’s so beauti-ful.

00:32:51.431 --> 00:32:56.782
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

00:32:56.782 --> 00:33:02.811
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:08.481
very wise and I can see the wisdom written large
on their faces.

00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:19.831
In this wisdom, what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:29.042
most of our problems are coming from human
beings. Because ecological problem, or any

00:33:29.042 --> 00:33:33.702
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

00:33:33.702 --> 00:33:39.431
Or other problems that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

00:33:39.431 --> 00:33:44.322
problems that it’s sort of endless and you
cannot change them.

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:49.751
You feel very nice sitting underneath this,
because you are fed up with the same ways that you have and

00:33:49.751 --> 00:33:58.402
the problems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

00:33:58.402 --> 00:34:10.282
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the wisdom plays such a part in life,

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:16.761
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:21.902
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

00:34:21.902 --> 00:34:23.592
You change within.

00:34:23.592 --> 00:34:32.542
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected of others,

00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:39.292
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

00:34:39.292 --> 00:34:43.602
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

00:34:43.602 --> 00:34:49.642
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

00:34:49.642 --> 00:34:55.131
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:56.881
You know practically everything.

00:34:56.881 --> 00:34:59.361
I don’t have to tell you anything.

00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:05.861
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

00:35:05.861 --> 00:35:15.782
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:19.082
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

00:35:19.082 --> 00:35:26.722
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

00:35:26.722 --> 00:35:30.681
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:41.131
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:45.201
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

00:35:45.201 --> 00:35:50.472
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

00:35:50.472 --> 00:35:56.212
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

00:35:56.212 --> 00:36:00.241
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:04.881
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

00:36:04.881 --> 00:36:07.712
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

00:36:07.712 --> 00:36:10.102
He doesn’t have to question anything.

00:36:10.102 --> 00:36:12.501
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:14.282
He is just there.

00:36:14.282 --> 00:36:17.051
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

00:36:17.051 --> 00:36:26.571
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

00:36:26.571 --> 00:36:28.761
about things, nothing of the kind.

00:36:28.761 --> 00:36:33.732
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

00:36:33.732 --> 00:36:42.051
Small, small stories can show you how He was
so sure of himself, how He had courage and

00:36:42.051 --> 00:36:48.502
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

00:36:48.502 --> 00:36:53.032
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

00:36:53.032 --> 00:37:00.472
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:03.681
what is to be done. Like that [straight].
This is the point.

00:37:03.681 --> 00:37:06.402
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

00:37:06.402 --> 00:37:11.912
I’ve seen many people who say, "Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

00:37:11.912 --> 00:37:19.272
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out".

00:37:19.272 --> 00:37:23.251
Now, I must say this is a state.

00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:28.542
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

00:37:28.542 --> 00:37:29.801
Means you are there.

00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:35.951
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

00:37:35.951 --> 00:37:45.491
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

00:37:45.491 --> 00:37:51.022
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

00:37:51.022 --> 00:37:57.892
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

00:37:57.892 --> 00:38:06.112
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

00:38:06.112 --> 00:38:15.342
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

00:38:15.342 --> 00:38:17.582
He’s a thief now.

00:38:17.582 --> 00:38:20.441
What should you do with a thief?

00:38:20.441 --> 00:38:26.422
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

00:38:26.422 --> 00:38:32.962
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

00:38:32.962 --> 00:38:39.631
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget. Not to worry about it too much, "Oh,

00:38:39.631 --> 00:38:47.131
this has happened, that has happened. And how
to make this point all right? And this gentleman

00:38:47.131 --> 00:38:49.131
is not all right.This, that".

00:38:49.131 --> 00:38:56.761
Just forget it.
So, the wisdom is also in forgiving.

00:38:56.761 --> 00:39:00.741
That why Christ talked about forgiveness.
Just forgive.

00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:04.171
There’s no sense in remembering.

00:39:04.171 --> 00:39:07.662
"This person said so, this person did so, that
happened".

00:39:07.662 --> 00:39:12.832
So, just forget it. And once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

00:39:12.832 --> 00:39:16.542
right things and useless things you’ll just
forgive.

00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:23.191
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has been misbehaving.

00:39:23.191 --> 00:39:27.681
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about me

00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:29.332
saying things, this, that.

00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:30.501
It’s all right.

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:34.092
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

00:39:34.092 --> 00:39:39.231
But what bothers me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen to them.

00:39:39.321 --> 00:39:44.833
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone, I say,

00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:47.462
"Baba, I have nothing to say".

00:39:47.462 --> 00:39:52.442
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

00:39:52.442 --> 00:39:54.222
to happen to them?

00:39:54.222 --> 00:40:02.352
They’re doing this to someone who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

00:40:02.352 --> 00:40:04.342
in spiritual life.

00:40:04.342 --> 00:40:09.602
Then you can’t play about. But somebody is
playing! Then what you have to do is to really

00:40:09.602 --> 00:40:15.832
forgive because one thing is built-in, in Sahaja
Yoga, that who try to trouble you, they will

00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:20.631
be in trouble also.
So, try to forgive at least. At least, you soothe him down,

00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:21.962
"All right, I forgive you".

00:40:21.962 --> 00:40:24.562
So, soothe him down.

00:40:24.562 --> 00:40:30.691
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

00:40:30.691 --> 00:40:42.352
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of pursue, I should say, pursue the matter.

00:40:42.352 --> 00:40:46.782
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

00:40:46.782 --> 00:40:51.532
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:53.972
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

00:40:53.972 --> 00:40:56.421
You know he steals your money.

00:40:56.421 --> 00:41:00.881
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:01.881
out.

00:41:01.881 --> 00:41:03.001
Then you have another one.

00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:05.611
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

00:41:05.611 --> 00:41:12.342
It goes on like that because they’re poor people, they just steal if they get.
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

00:41:12.342 --> 00:41:18.241
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

00:41:18.241 --> 00:41:20.342
that he cannot reach.

00:41:20.342 --> 00:41:21.872
Finished.

00:41:21.872 --> 00:41:23.321
As simple as this.

00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:28.001
You should just find out what does he steal.

00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:29.742
Oh, that’s all.

00:41:29.742 --> 00:41:36.511
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

00:41:36.511 --> 00:41:43.232
"Now, how am I to save myself from this thief?
Or, how am I to punish him?" Just don’t think.

00:41:43.232 --> 00:41:48.551
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
and going.

00:41:48.551 --> 00:41:51.042
These relationships are just like that.

00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:52.681
There’s no depth in it.

00:41:52.681 --> 00:42:00.731
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:06.052
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

00:42:06.052 --> 00:42:09.072
The wisdom is in living in the present.

00:42:09.072 --> 00:42:12.701
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

00:42:12.701 --> 00:42:18.081
Now, if I say, "Forget the past", one may say,
"How to do it? How to forget the past?"

00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:22.211
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:28.312
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in the centre,

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:34.831
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

00:42:34.831 --> 00:42:45.632
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

00:42:45.632 --> 00:42:49.951
getting after someone.

00:42:49.951 --> 00:42:55.341
Where is the time? Just think like that.

00:42:55.341 --> 00:43:00.971
Now supposing someone says something to me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:01.971
do something about it.

00:43:01.971 --> 00:43:03.581
You must punish that person.

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:13.392
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

00:43:13.392 --> 00:43:21.642
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So, our wisdom is finished.

00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:26.062
We have no wisdom at all.

00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:30.152
Even at the highest level, you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

00:43:30.152 --> 00:43:44.481
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:51.372
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sannyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

00:43:51.372 --> 00:43:52.372
there happily.

00:43:52.372 --> 00:43:55.012
There’s no wisdom in that also.

00:43:55.012 --> 00:44:00.302
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

00:44:00.302 --> 00:44:06.892
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

00:44:06.892 --> 00:44:12.071
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything. And that’s

00:44:12.071 --> 00:44:19.762
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

00:44:19.762 --> 00:44:30.202
So, this wisdom is to live in the present.
It's now that you ask somebody, "How are you?"

00:44:30.202 --> 00:44:31.492
"All right [means not good]".

00:44:31.492 --> 00:44:34.812
Then, he is not in the present.

00:44:34.812 --> 00:44:40.912
You ask somebody, "Are you enjoying yourself?"
[Not much] Not in the present.

00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:46.402
You ask somebody, "Are you happy?" "No".

00:44:46.402 --> 00:44:49.422
Then you are not in the present.

00:44:49.422 --> 00:44:57.112
You ask someone that, "Are you hungry?" "Maybe,
may not be".

00:44:57.112 --> 00:45:03.012
I mean, they don’t know, even in the present,
if they are hungry or not.

00:45:03.012 --> 00:45:08.152
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

00:45:08.152 --> 00:45:10.702
of unwise behavior, unwise line,

00:45:10.702 --> 00:45:16.672
if they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:22.552
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

00:45:22.552 --> 00:45:27.142
They’re just in the present. And in the present,
whatever they have to do, they will do it.

00:45:27.142 --> 00:45:30.142
This is a very good practice.

00:45:30.142 --> 00:45:35.512
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

00:45:35.512 --> 00:45:39.382
Just think, "What I have to do just now? What
am I to do".

00:45:39.382 --> 00:45:43.782
Like you are getting out of the house.

00:45:43.782 --> 00:45:48.402
Many people will go half way, "Oh, my God!
I have left my passport".

00:45:48.402 --> 00:45:50.362
They’ll go back.

00:45:50.362 --> 00:45:52.882
Then again, some time they will come out.

00:45:52.882 --> 00:45:54.842
"My God, I have left my spectacles".

00:45:54.842 --> 00:45:56.472
Again go back.

00:45:56.472 --> 00:45:59.492
Then again they will come back and say, "I
have lost this.

00:45:59.492 --> 00:46:00.562
I should have this".

00:46:00.562 --> 00:46:03.712
This kind of people are very, very common.

00:46:03.712 --> 00:46:08.562
So, at that time when you are leaving the house,
at that time, if you are in the

00:46:08.562 --> 00:46:14.492
present, then you just think, "What have I
to take? Let's see, one, two, three, four,

00:46:14.492 --> 00:46:15.692
five, yes.

00:46:15.692 --> 00:46:19.091
This is is what I have to take and this
there".

00:46:19.091 --> 00:46:30.101
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom itself. Means, the wisdom acts by itself.

00:46:30.101 --> 00:46:31.682
It’s a power.

00:46:31.682 --> 00:46:32.951
Wisdom is a very big power.

00:46:32.951 --> 00:46:36.322
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

00:46:36.322 --> 00:46:42.571
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:49.802
It’s such a tremendous power that God has
given us, that we are wise. And this wisdom,

00:46:49.802 --> 00:46:58.242
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly, within ourselves.

00:46:58.242 --> 00:47:01.612
So, today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there,

00:47:01.612 --> 00:47:06.842
while we should ask for wisdom. And for that,
we have to be in the present.

00:47:06.842 --> 00:47:10.841
Every way, you should be in the present.

00:47:10.841 --> 00:47:17.742
If you can try, you can be, because your Kundalini
has been awakened, and you can be all the time

00:47:17.742 --> 00:47:25.992
in the present. But today, you should first
try and get the Kundalini established in the

00:47:25.992 --> 00:47:27.602
present.

00:47:27.612 --> 00:47:31.032
May God bless you.
