WEBVTT

24:55.002 --> 25:04.931
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

25:04.931 --> 25:13.192
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

25:13.192 --> 25:32.922
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoy-ing
it very much.

25:32.922 --> 25:43.672
Today being the first puja in Maha-rastra,
we have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

25:43.672 --> 25:55.042
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharastra
that people worship Ganesha.

25:55.042 --> 26:07.312
As you know there are … eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

26:07.312 --> 26:17.412
Maharastra which has got on one side one big
mountain.

26:17.412 --> 26:24.272
On the other side we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharastra.

26:24.272 --> 26:26.441
And also on top we have another moun-tain.

26:26.441 --> 26:37.102
So like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara
means the Kundalini itself.

26:37.102 --> 26:40.792
So the Ku ndalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

26:40.792 --> 26:47.892
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharastra, as the country which is very

26:47.892 --> 26:50.542
great, the nation which is very great.

26:50.542 --> 27:01.982
But I don’t know how far Maharastrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharastra.

27:01.982 --> 27:17.832
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

27:17.832 --> 27:23.732
a different style, a differ-ent type.

27:23.732 --> 27:35.142
The best part of Maharastra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

27:35.142 --> 27:47.271
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

27:47.271 --> 27:57.122
helps you in so many ways and that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

27:57.122 --> 28:04.082
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

28:04.082 --> 28:08.842
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

28:08.842 --> 28:21.161
For Ganesha is t he one actually who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

28:21.161 --> 28:29.322
is innocence and the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

28:29.322 --> 28:35.051
and egos that are distracting your attention.

28:35.051 --> 28:42.672
So the attention which is so wobbly otherwise
in other places can settle down very well

28:42.672 --> 28:51.812
in Maharastra because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

28:51.812 --> 28:55.622
have very good attention.

28:55.622 --> 29:04.242
With that good attention you can really do
so many things like now, for example, you

29:04.242 --> 29:06.902
can see the software.

29:06.902 --> 29:08.221
Good mathematics.

29:08.221 --> 29:16.472
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

29:16.472 --> 29:26.671
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

29:26.671 --> 29:30.822
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

29:30.822 --> 29:33.882
He’s a giver of wisdom.

29:33.882 --> 29:39.322
Means just His wisdom becomes just a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

29:39.322 --> 29:41.192
You become just wise.

29:41.192 --> 29:43.551
Now somebody may ask, ÒMother how to become
wise.

29:43.551 --> 29:46.942
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

29:46.942 --> 29:50.702
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

29:50.702 --> 29:54.231
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

29:54.231 --> 29:56.132
He’s so wise.

29:56.132 --> 30:08.811
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

30:08.811 --> 30:14.931
who is a Sahaja Yogi because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

30:14.931 --> 30:22.692
So he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

30:22.692 --> 30:33.852
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

30:33.852 --> 30:37.641
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

30:37.641 --> 30:40.711
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

30:40.711 --> 30:44.162
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

30:44.162 --> 30:53.762
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
in-nately built in.

30:53.762 --> 31:00.382
Only thing is we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

31:00.382 --> 31:05.811
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

31:05.811 --> 31:07.271
what this wisdom is.

31:07.271 --> 31:10.541
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

31:10.541 --> 31:13.841
You give up all your attachments.

31:13.841 --> 31:19.581
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

31:19.581 --> 31:22.982
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

31:22.982 --> 31:28.972
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just hap-pens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

31:28.972 --> 31:30.461
what is not needed.

31:30.461 --> 31:33.272
In that wisdom you throw away whatever is
wrong.

31:33.272 --> 31:40.222
So that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves.

31:40.222 --> 31:46.551
This manifes-tation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think, not that it is only

31:46.551 --> 31:53.442
the blessings, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

31:53.442 --> 32:01.352
That’s why IÔve been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our

32:01.352 --> 32:02.352
children.

32:02.352 --> 32:06.542
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

32:06.542 --> 32:08.102
Tattwa is already there.

32:08.102 --> 32:13.192
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

32:13.192 --> 32:16.341
Once that happens then children are safe.

32:16.341 --> 32:19.201
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

32:19.201 --> 32:22.222
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

32:22.222 --> 32:26.352
They will never be again in the wrong path.

32:26.352 --> 32:32.581
But if from early childhood, you did not have
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

32:32.581 --> 32:40.651
about Kundalini or about wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate

32:40.651 --> 32:41.651
it.

32:41.651 --> 32:49.371
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

32:49.371 --> 32:51.651
It’s so beauti-ful.

32:51.651 --> 32:57.002
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

32:57.002 --> 33:03.031
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

33:03.031 --> 33:08.701
very wise and I can see the wisdom writ large
on their faces.

33:08.701 --> 33:20.051
In this wisdom what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

33:20.051 --> 33:29.262
most of our problems are coming from human
beings because ecological problem, or any

33:29.262 --> 33:33.922
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

33:33.922 --> 33:39.651
Or other programs that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

33:39.651 --> 33:44.542
problems that it’s sort of endless and they
cannot change them.

33:44.542 --> 33:49.971
You feel very nice sitting underneath this
because you are fed up … that you have and

33:49.971 --> 33:58.622
the prob-lems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

33:58.622 --> 34:10.502
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the… wisdom plays such a part in life

34:10.502 --> 34:16.981
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

34:16.981 --> 34:22.122
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

34:22.122 --> 34:23.812
You change within.

34:23.812 --> 34:32.762
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected o f others,

34:32.762 --> 34:39.512
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

34:39.512 --> 34:43.822
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

34:43.822 --> 34:49.862
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

34:49.862 --> 34:55.351
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

34:55.351 --> 34:57.101
You know practically everything.

34:57.101 --> 34:59.581
I don’t have to tell you anything.

34:59.581 --> 35:06.081
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

35:06.081 --> 35:16.002
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

35:16.002 --> 35:19.302
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

35:19.302 --> 35:26.942
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

35:26.942 --> 35:30.901
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

35:30.901 --> 35:41.351
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

35:41.351 --> 35:45.421
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

35:45.421 --> 35:50.692
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

35:50.692 --> 35:56.432
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

35:56.432 --> 36:00.461
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

36:00.461 --> 36:05.101
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

36:05.101 --> 36:07.932
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

36:07.932 --> 36:10.322
He doesn’t have to question anything.

36:10.322 --> 36:12.721
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

36:12.721 --> 36:14.502
He is just there.

36:14.502 --> 36:17.271
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

36:17.271 --> 36:26.791
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

36:26.791 --> 36:28.981
about things, nothing of the kind.

36:28.981 --> 36:33.952
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

36:33.952 --> 36:42.271
Small, small stories can show He how you were
so sure of Hims }elf, how He had courage and

36:42.271 --> 36:48.722
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

36:48.722 --> 36:53.252
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

36:53.252 --> 37:00.692
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

37:00.692 --> 37:03.901
what is to be done like the – this is the
point.

37:03.901 --> 37:06.622
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

37:06.622 --> 37:12.132
I’ve seen many people who say, Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

37:12.132 --> 37:19.492
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out.

37:19.492 --> 37:23.471
Now, I must say this is a state.

37:23.471 --> 37:28.762
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

37:28.762 --> 37:30.021
Means you are there.

37:30.021 --> 37:36.171
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

37:36.171 --> 37:45.711
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

37:45.711 --> 37:51.242
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

37:51.242 --> 37:58.112
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

37:58.112 --> 38:06.332
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

38:06.332 --> 38:15.562
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

38:15.562 --> 38:17.802
He’s a thief now.

38:17.802 --> 38:20.661
What should you do with a thief.

38:20.661 --> 38:26.642
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

38:26.642 --> 38:33.182
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

38:33.182 --> 38:39.851
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget, not to worry about it too much, Oh,

38:39.851 --> 38:47.351
this has happened, that has happened and how
to make this point all right and this gentleman

38:47.351 --> 38:48.351
is not all right.

38:48.351 --> 38:49.351
This, that.

38:49.351 --> 38:56.981
Just forget it.
So the wisdom is also in forgiving.

38:56.981 --> 39:00.961
That why Christ talked about forgiveness?
Just forgive.

39:00.961 --> 39:04.391
There’s no sense in remembering.

39:04.391 --> 39:07.882
This person said so, this person did so, that
happened so.

39:07.882 --> 39:13.052
Just forget it and once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

39:13.052 --> 39:16.762
right things and useless things you’ll just
forget.

39:16.762 --> 39:23.411
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has be íen misbehaving.

39:23.411 --> 39:27.601
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about

39:27.601 --> 39:29.552
Me, saying things, this, that.

39:29.552 --> 39:30.721
It’s all right.

39:30.721 --> 39:34.312
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

39:34.312 --> 39:38.451
But what bothers Me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen

39:38.451 --> 39:39.541
to them.

39:39.541 --> 39:45.053
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone I … forgive.

39:45.053 --> 39:47.682
I have nothing to say.

39:47.682 --> 39:52.662
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

39:52.662 --> 39:54.442
to happen to them.

39:54.442 --> 40:02.572
They’re doing this to some one who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

40:02.572 --> 40:04.562
in spiritual life.

40:04.562 --> 40:09.822
Then you can’t play about but somebody’s
playing, then what you have to do is to really

40:09.822 --> 40:16.052
forgive because one thing is built-in in Sahaja
Yoga that who tries to trouble you they will

40:16.052 --> 40:19.841
be trouble also.
So try to forgive at least, at least you soothe

40:19.841 --> 40:20.841
them down.

40:20.841 --> 40:22.182
All right, I forgive you.

40:22.182 --> 40:24.782
So soothe them down.

40:24.782 --> 40:30.911
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

40:30.911 --> 40:42.572
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of – I should say – pursue the matter.

40:42.572 --> 40:47.002
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

40:47.002 --> 40:51.752
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

40:51.752 --> 40:54.192
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

40:54.192 --> 40:56.641
You know he steals your money.

40:56.641 --> 41:01.101
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

41:01.101 --> 41:02.101
out.

41:02.101 --> 41:03.221
Then you have another one.

41:03.221 --> 41:05.831
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

41:05.831 --> 41:12.562
Go on like that because they’re poor people….
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

41:12.562 --> 41:18.461
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

41:18.461 --> 41:20.562
that he cannot reach.

41:20.562 --> 41:22.092
Finished.

41:22.092 --> 41:23.541
As simple as this.

41:23.541 --> 41:28.221
You should just find out what doe s he steal.

41:28.221 --> 41:29.962
Oh, that’s all.

41:29.962 --> 41:36.731
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

41:36.731 --> 41:43.452
Now, how am I to save myself from this thief
or how am I to punish him? Just don’t think.

41:43.452 --> 41:48.771
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
any way.

41:48.771 --> 41:51.262
These relationships are just like that.

41:51.262 --> 41:52.901
There’s no depth in it.

41:52.901 --> 42:00.951
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

42:00.951 --> 42:06.272
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

42:06.272 --> 42:09.292
The wisdom is in living in the present.

42:09.292 --> 42:12.921
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

42:12.921 --> 42:18.301
Now, if I say forget the past, then they say,
How to do it? How to forget the past.

42:18.301 --> 42:22.431
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

42:22.431 --> 42:28.532
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in th e centre,

42:28.532 --> 42:35.051
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

42:35.051 --> 42:45.852
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

42:45.852 --> 42:50.171
getting after some one.

42:50.171 --> 42:55.561
Where is the time? Just think like that.

42:55.561 --> 43:01.191
Now supposing some one says something to Me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

43:01.191 --> 43:02.191
do something about it.

43:02.191 --> 43:03.801
You must punish that person.

43:03.801 --> 43:13.612
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

43:13.612 --> 43:21.862
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So our wisdom is finished.

43:21.862 --> 43:26.282
We have no wisdom at all.

43:26.282 --> 43:30.372
Even at the highest level you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

43:30.372 --> 43:44.701
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

43:44.701 --> 43:51.592
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sanyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

43:51.592 --> 43:52.592
there happily.

43:52.592 --> 43:55.232
There’s no wisdom in that also.

43:55.232 --> 44:00.522
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

44:00.522 --> 44:07.112
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

44:07.112 --> 44:12.291
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything and that’s

44:12.291 --> 44:19.982
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

44:19.982 --> 44:30.422
So this wisdom is to live in the present,
is now that you ask somebody, How are you?

44:30.422 --> 44:31.712
All right.

44:31.712 --> 44:35.032
And he’s not in the present.

44:35.032 --> 44:41.132
You ask somebody, Are you enjoying yourself?
Not in the present.

44:41.132 --> 44:46.622
You ask somebody, Are you happy? No.

44:46.622 --> 44:49.642
Then you are not in the present.

44:49.642 --> 44:57.332
You ask some one that, Are you hungry? Maybe,
may not be.

44:57.332 --> 45:03.232
Maybe they don’t know even in the present
if they are hungry or not.

45:03.232 --> 45:08.372
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

45:08.372 --> 45:10.922
of unwise behavior, unwise line.

45:10.922 --> 45:16.892
If they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

45:16.892 --> 45:22.772
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

45:22.772 --> 45:27.362
They’re just in the present and in the present
whatever they have to do, they just do it.

45:27.362 --> 45:30.362
This is a very good practice.

45:30.362 --> 45:35.732
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

45:35.732 --> 45:39.602
Just say, What am I to do right now? What
am I to do.

45:39.602 --> 45:44.002
Like you’re getting out of the house.

45:44.002 --> 45:48.622
Many people leave half way – Oh, my God,
I have left my passport.

45:48.622 --> 45:50.582
They’ll go back.

45:50.582 --> 45:53.102
Then again, some time they will come out.

45:53.102 --> 45:55.062
My God, I have left my spectacles.

45:55.062 --> 45:56.692
Again go back.

45:56.692 --> 45:59.712
Then again they will come back and say, I
have lost this.

45:59.712 --> 46:00.782
I should have this.

46:00.782 --> 46:03.932
These kind of people are very, very common.

46:03.932 --> 46:08.782
So at that style when you are leaving the
house, say, at that time, if you’re in the

46:08.782 --> 46:14.712
present, then you just think, What have I
to take? Just say, One, two, three, four,

46:14.712 --> 46:15.712
five.

46:15.712 --> 46:19.311
Yes, this is is what I have to take and this
there.

46:19.311 --> 46:29.321
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom, itself, means the wisdom acts by

46:29.321 --> 46:30.321
itself.

46:30.321 --> 46:31.902
It’s a power.

46:31.902 --> 46:33.171
Wisdom is a very big power.

46:33.171 --> 46:36.542
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

46:36.542 --> 46:42.791
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

46:42.791 --> 46:50.022
It’s such a tremendous power that one has
given us that we are wise and this wisdom

46:50.022 --> 46:58.462
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly within ourselves.

46:58.462 --> 47:01.832
So today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there.

47:01.832 --> 47:07.062
Now you should ask for wisdom and for that
we have to be in the present.

47:07.062 --> 47:11.061
Every way we should be in the present.

47:11.061 --> 47:17.962
If you can try, you can be because your kundalini
has been awakened and you can be all the time

47:17.962 --> 47:26.212
in the present, but today you should first
try and get the kundalini established in the

47:26.212 --> 47:27.822
present.

47:27.832 --> 47:31.252
May God bless you.
