00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:53.877
15 Dec 1991 Shri Ganesha
Puja: He’s a giver of wisdom. Shere (India)

00:24:54.782 --> 00:25:04.711
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

00:25:04.711 --> 00:25:12.972
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

00:25:12.972 --> 00:25:32.702
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoying
it very much.

00:25:32.702 --> 00:25:43.452
Today being the first puja in Maharashtra,
we'll have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

00:25:43.452 --> 00:25:54.822
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharashtra
that people worship Ganesha.

00:25:54.822 --> 00:26:07.092
As you know there are Ashtavinayakas, eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

00:26:07.092 --> 00:26:17.192
Maharashtra which has got on one side one big
mountain,

00:26:17.192 --> 00:26:24.052
on the other side, we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharashtra.

00:26:24.052 --> 00:26:26.221
And also, on top, we have another mountain.

00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:36.882
So, like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara,
means the Kundalini itself.

00:26:36.882 --> 00:26:40.572
So, the Kundalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

00:26:40.572 --> 00:26:47.672
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharashtra, as the country which is very

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:50.322
great, the nation which is very great.

00:26:50.322 --> 00:27:01.762
But I don’t know how far Maharashtrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharashtra.

00:27:01.762 --> 00:27:17.612
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

00:27:17.612 --> 00:27:23.512
a different style, a different type.

00:27:23.512 --> 00:27:34.922
The best part of Maharashtra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

00:27:34.922 --> 00:27:47.051
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

00:27:47.051 --> 00:27:56.902
helps you in so many ways. And that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

00:27:56.902 --> 00:28:03.862
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

00:28:03.862 --> 00:28:08.622
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

00:28:08.622 --> 00:28:20.941
For Ganesha is actually the one who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:29.102
is innocence. And the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

00:28:29.102 --> 00:28:34.831
and egos that are distracting your attention.

00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:42.452
So, the attention which is so wobbly otherwise,
in other places, can settle down very well

00:28:42.452 --> 00:28:51.592
in Maharashtra. Because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

00:28:51.592 --> 00:28:55.402
have very good attention.

00:28:55.402 --> 00:29:04.022
With that good attention, they can really do
so many things. Like now, for example, you

00:29:04.022 --> 00:29:06.682
can see the software,

00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:08.001
good mathematics.

00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:16.252
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

00:29:16.252 --> 00:29:26.451
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:30.602
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:33.662
He’s a giver of wisdom.

00:29:33.662 --> 00:29:39.102
means just wisdom becomes a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

00:29:39.102 --> 00:29:40.972
You become just wise.

00:29:40.972 --> 00:29:43.331
Now somebody may ask, "Mother how to become
wise?"

00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:46.722
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:50.482
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

00:29:50.482 --> 00:29:54.011
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:55.912
He’s so wise.

00:29:55.912 --> 00:30:08.591
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:14.711
who is a Sahaja Yogi. Because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:22.472
So, he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

00:30:22.472 --> 00:30:33.632
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

00:30:33.632 --> 00:30:37.421
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:40.491
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:40.491 --> 00:30:43.942
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:53.542
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
innately built-in.

00:30:53.542 --> 00:31:00.162
Only thing is, we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:05.591
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:07.051
what is wisdom is.

00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:10.321
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

00:31:10.321 --> 00:31:13.621
You give up all your attachments.

00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:19.361
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:22.762
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

00:31:22.762 --> 00:31:28.752
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just happens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

00:31:28.752 --> 00:31:30.241
what is not needed.

00:31:30.241 --> 00:31:33.052
In that wisdom, you throw away whatever is
wrong.

00:31:33.052 --> 00:31:40.002
So, that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves!

00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:46.331
This manifestation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think. Not that it is only

00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:53.212
the basis, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

00:31:53.222 --> 00:32:02.132
That’s why I have been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our children.

00:32:02.132 --> 00:32:06.322
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

00:32:06.322 --> 00:32:07.882
Tattwa is already there.

00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:12.972
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:16.121
Once that happens then children are safe.

00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:18.981
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

00:32:18.981 --> 00:32:22.002
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

00:32:22.002 --> 00:32:26.132
They will never be again in the wrong path.

00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:32.361
But from early childhood, if you never had
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:41.401
about Kundalini or about the wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate it.

00:32:41.431 --> 00:32:49.151
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

00:32:49.151 --> 00:32:51.431
It’s so beauti-ful.

00:32:51.431 --> 00:32:56.782
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

00:32:56.782 --> 00:33:02.811
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:08.481
very wise and I can see the wisdom written large
on their faces.

00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:19.831
In this wisdom, what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:29.042
most of our problems are coming from human
beings. Because ecological problem, or any

00:33:29.042 --> 00:33:33.702
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

00:33:33.702 --> 00:33:39.431
Or other problems that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

00:33:39.431 --> 00:33:44.322
problems that it’s sort of endless and you
cannot change them.

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:49.751
You feel very nice sitting underneath this,
because you are fed up with the same ways that you have and

00:33:49.751 --> 00:33:58.402
the problems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

00:33:58.402 --> 00:34:10.282
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the wisdom plays such a part in life,

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:16.761
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:21.902
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

00:34:21.902 --> 00:34:23.592
You change within.

00:34:23.592 --> 00:34:32.542
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected of others,

00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:39.292
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

00:34:39.292 --> 00:34:43.602
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

00:34:43.602 --> 00:34:49.642
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

00:34:49.642 --> 00:34:55.131
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:56.881
You know practically everything.

00:34:56.881 --> 00:34:59.361
I don’t have to tell you anything.

00:34:59.361 --> 00:35:05.861
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

00:35:05.861 --> 00:35:15.782
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:19.082
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

00:35:19.082 --> 00:35:26.722
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

00:35:26.722 --> 00:35:30.681
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:41.131
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:45.201
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

00:35:45.201 --> 00:35:50.472
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

00:35:50.472 --> 00:35:56.212
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

00:35:56.212 --> 00:36:00.241
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:04.881
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

00:36:04.881 --> 00:36:07.712
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

00:36:07.712 --> 00:36:10.102
He doesn’t have to question anything.

00:36:10.102 --> 00:36:12.501
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:14.282
He is just there.

00:36:14.282 --> 00:36:17.051
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

00:36:17.051 --> 00:36:26.571
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

00:36:26.571 --> 00:36:28.761
about things, nothing of the kind.

00:36:28.761 --> 00:36:33.732
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

00:36:33.732 --> 00:36:42.051
Small, small stories can show you how He was
so sure of himself, how He had courage and

00:36:42.051 --> 00:36:48.502
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

00:36:48.502 --> 00:36:53.032
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

00:36:53.032 --> 00:37:00.472
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:03.681
what is to be done. Like that [straight].
This is the point.

00:37:03.681 --> 00:37:06.402
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

00:37:06.402 --> 00:37:11.912
I’ve seen many people who say, "Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

00:37:11.912 --> 00:37:19.272
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out".

00:37:19.272 --> 00:37:23.251
Now, I must say this is a state.

00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:28.542
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

00:37:28.542 --> 00:37:29.801
Means you are there.

00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:35.951
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

00:37:35.951 --> 00:37:45.491
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

00:37:45.491 --> 00:37:51.022
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

00:37:51.022 --> 00:37:57.892
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

00:37:57.892 --> 00:38:06.112
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

00:38:06.112 --> 00:38:15.342
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

00:38:15.342 --> 00:38:17.582
He’s a thief now.

00:38:17.582 --> 00:38:20.441
What should you do with a thief?

00:38:20.441 --> 00:38:26.422
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

00:38:26.422 --> 00:38:32.962
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

00:38:32.962 --> 00:38:39.631
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget. Not to worry about it too much, "Oh,

00:38:39.631 --> 00:38:47.131
this has happened, that has happened. And how
to make this point all right? And this gentleman

00:38:47.131 --> 00:38:49.131
is not all right.This, that".

00:38:49.131 --> 00:38:56.761
Just forget it.
So, the wisdom is also in forgiving.

00:38:56.761 --> 00:39:00.741
That why Christ talked about forgiveness.
Just forgive.

00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:04.171
There’s no sense in remembering.

00:39:04.171 --> 00:39:07.662
"This person said so, this person did so, that
happened".

00:39:07.662 --> 00:39:12.832
So, just forget it. And once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

00:39:12.832 --> 00:39:16.542
right things and useless things you’ll just
forgive.

00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:23.191
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has been misbehaving.

00:39:23.191 --> 00:39:27.681
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about me

00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:29.332
saying things, this, that.

00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:30.501
It’s all right.

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:34.092
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

00:39:34.092 --> 00:39:39.231
But what bothers me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen to them.

00:39:39.321 --> 00:39:44.833
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone, I say,

00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:47.462
"Baba, I have nothing to say".

00:39:47.462 --> 00:39:52.442
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

00:39:52.442 --> 00:39:54.222
to happen to them?

00:39:54.222 --> 00:40:02.352
They’re doing this to someone who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

00:40:02.352 --> 00:40:04.342
in spiritual life.

00:40:04.342 --> 00:40:09.602
Then you can’t play about. But somebody is
playing! Then what you have to do is to really

00:40:09.602 --> 00:40:15.832
forgive because one thing is built-in, in Sahaja
Yoga, that who try to trouble you, they will

00:40:15.832 --> 00:40:20.631
be in trouble also.
So, try to forgive at least. At least, you soothe him down,

00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:21.962
"All right, I forgive you".

00:40:21.962 --> 00:40:24.562
So, soothe him down.

00:40:24.562 --> 00:40:30.691
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

00:40:30.691 --> 00:40:42.352
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of pursue, I should say, pursue the matter.

00:40:42.352 --> 00:40:46.782
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

00:40:46.782 --> 00:40:51.532
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:53.972
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

00:40:53.972 --> 00:40:56.421
You know he steals your money.

00:40:56.421 --> 00:41:00.881
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:01.881
out.

00:41:01.881 --> 00:41:03.001
Then you have another one.

00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:05.611
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

00:41:05.611 --> 00:41:12.342
It goes on like that because they’re poor people, they just steal if they get.
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

00:41:12.342 --> 00:41:18.241
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

00:41:18.241 --> 00:41:20.342
that he cannot reach.

00:41:20.342 --> 00:41:21.872
Finished.

00:41:21.872 --> 00:41:23.321
As simple as this.

00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:28.001
You should just find out what does he steal.

00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:29.742
Oh, that’s all.

00:41:29.742 --> 00:41:36.511
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

00:41:36.511 --> 00:41:43.232
"Now, how am I to save myself from this thief?
Or, how am I to punish him?" Just don’t think.

00:41:43.232 --> 00:41:48.551
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
and going.

00:41:48.551 --> 00:41:51.042
These relationships are just like that.

00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:52.681
There’s no depth in it.

00:41:52.681 --> 00:42:00.731
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:06.052
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

00:42:06.052 --> 00:42:09.072
The wisdom is in living in the present.

00:42:09.072 --> 00:42:12.701
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

00:42:12.701 --> 00:42:18.081
Now, if I say, "Forget the past", one may say,
"How to do it? How to forget the past?"

00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:22.211
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:28.312
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in the centre,

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:34.831
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

00:42:34.831 --> 00:42:45.632
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

00:42:45.632 --> 00:42:49.951
getting after someone.

00:42:49.951 --> 00:42:55.341
Where is the time? Just think like that.

00:42:55.341 --> 00:43:00.971
Now supposing someone says something to me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:01.971
do something about it.

00:43:01.971 --> 00:43:03.581
You must punish that person.

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:13.392
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

00:43:13.392 --> 00:43:21.642
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So, our wisdom is finished.

00:43:21.642 --> 00:43:26.062
We have no wisdom at all.

00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:30.152
Even at the highest level, you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

00:43:30.152 --> 00:43:44.481
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

00:43:44.481 --> 00:43:51.372
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sannyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

00:43:51.372 --> 00:43:52.372
there happily.

00:43:52.372 --> 00:43:55.012
There’s no wisdom in that also.

00:43:55.012 --> 00:44:00.302
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

00:44:00.302 --> 00:44:06.892
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

00:44:06.892 --> 00:44:12.071
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything. And that’s

00:44:12.071 --> 00:44:19.762
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

00:44:19.762 --> 00:44:30.202
So, this wisdom is to live in the present.
It's now that you ask somebody, "How are you?"

00:44:30.202 --> 00:44:31.492
"All right [means not good]".

00:44:31.492 --> 00:44:34.812
Then, he is not in the present.

00:44:34.812 --> 00:44:40.912
You ask somebody, "Are you enjoying yourself?"
[Not much] Not in the present.

00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:46.402
You ask somebody, "Are you happy?" "No".

00:44:46.402 --> 00:44:49.422
Then you are not in the present.

00:44:49.422 --> 00:44:57.112
You ask someone that, "Are you hungry?" "Maybe,
may not be".

00:44:57.112 --> 00:45:03.012
I mean, they don’t know, even in the present,
if they are hungry or not.

00:45:03.012 --> 00:45:08.152
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

00:45:08.152 --> 00:45:10.702
of unwise behavior, unwise line,

00:45:10.702 --> 00:45:16.672
if they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:22.552
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

00:45:22.552 --> 00:45:27.142
They’re just in the present. And in the present,
whatever they have to do, they will do it.

00:45:27.142 --> 00:45:30.142
This is a very good practice.

00:45:30.142 --> 00:45:35.512
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

00:45:35.512 --> 00:45:39.382
Just think, "What I have to do just now? What
am I to do".

00:45:39.382 --> 00:45:43.782
Like you are getting out of the house.

00:45:43.782 --> 00:45:48.402
Many people will go half way, "Oh, my God!
I have left my passport".

00:45:48.402 --> 00:45:50.362
They’ll go back.

00:45:50.362 --> 00:45:52.882
Then again, some time they will come out.

00:45:52.882 --> 00:45:54.842
"My God, I have left my spectacles".

00:45:54.842 --> 00:45:56.472
Again go back.

00:45:56.472 --> 00:45:59.492
Then again they will come back and say, "I
have lost this.

00:45:59.492 --> 00:46:00.562
I should have this".

00:46:00.562 --> 00:46:03.712
This kind of people are very, very common.

00:46:03.712 --> 00:46:08.562
So, at that time when you are leaving the house,
at that time, if you are in the

00:46:08.562 --> 00:46:14.492
present, then you just think, "What have I
to take? Let's see, one, two, three, four,

00:46:14.492 --> 00:46:15.692
five, yes.

00:46:15.692 --> 00:46:19.091
This is is what I have to take and this
there".

00:46:19.091 --> 00:46:30.101
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom itself. Means, the wisdom acts by itself.

00:46:30.101 --> 00:46:31.682
It’s a power.

00:46:31.682 --> 00:46:32.951
Wisdom is a very big power.

00:46:32.951 --> 00:46:36.322
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

00:46:36.322 --> 00:46:42.571
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:49.802
It’s such a tremendous power that God has
given us, that we are wise. And this wisdom,

00:46:49.802 --> 00:46:58.242
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly, within ourselves.

00:46:58.242 --> 00:47:01.612
So, today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there,

00:47:01.612 --> 00:47:06.842
while we should ask for wisdom. And for that,
we have to be in the present.

00:47:06.842 --> 00:47:10.841
Every way, you should be in the present.

00:47:10.841 --> 00:47:17.742
If you can try, you can be, because your Kundalini
has been awakened, and you can be all the time

00:47:17.742 --> 00:47:25.992
in the present. But today, you should first
try and get the Kundalini established in the

00:47:25.992 --> 00:47:27.602
present.

00:47:27.612 --> 00:47:31.032
May God bless you.

00:47:32.797 --> 00:47:41.160
I was telling these people
that we will worhip Shri Ganesha today.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:47.440
A very significant function
of Shri Ganesha takes place in our body.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:55.760
Mind, intellect and body
– the control over all of these is Ganesh.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:04.160
The special gift bestowed on us by Shri
Ganesh is wisdom.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.560
Wisdom is one thing that we
don’t get by asking.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.640
If someone says that I will
give you wisdom, you should never believe.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:26.000
“After speaking in English, to speak
in Marathi I do not get appropriate words.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
I lose the continuity
if I have to speak in both the languages”.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.960
So there is no equivalent
for wisdom in Marathi.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.600
What do you say? No , not Vidvatta.

00:48:43.963 --> 00:48:49.280
That's why I started in english.

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:53.557
“Sudnyata.” ‘Sudnyata’
is a little serious word.

00:48:53.573 --> 00:48:54.640
OK.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:00.427
Let’s call it sudnyata,
instead of subuddhi.

00:49:00.427 --> 00:49:07.240
We should inculcate
that wisdom (sudnyata) in ourselves.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.083
How to do that?

00:49:09.083 --> 00:49:11.297
For that, you should
learn to live in the present.

00:49:11.297 --> 00:49:12.337
I teach that.

00:49:12.362 --> 00:49:15.557
Now in the present, at this time,
we are sitting here.

00:49:15.557 --> 00:49:16.820
This worship is taking place.

00:49:16.845 --> 00:49:18.525
And we are sitting here.

00:49:18.571 --> 00:49:24.120
So what is the
wisdom at this time?

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.680
That, the puja is taking place.
We have to do the puja.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.348
But at this moment if
we think of the future

00:49:29.372 --> 00:49:31.468
whether I will get the return bus or not?

00:49:31.492 --> 00:49:33.640
Will get food at home or not?

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.017
If something like this happens?

00:49:36.017 --> 00:49:38.070
If I am unable to go then?

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.657
If this and that about my son…

00:49:39.657 --> 00:49:43.800
If we think like this then you will
not be benefitted by the puja.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.680
If we think about the past, this happened,
that happened, did this

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.560
then it will again create a total mess.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:57.920
So this wisdom is something that one
should develop within us.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.200
There is a method to do this.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.948
Every time, wherever we are,

00:50:01.972 --> 00:50:04.628
we should examine whether we
are in the present or in the past.

00:50:04.652 --> 00:50:09.480
Because past is over and
future is not discernible.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.208


00:50:10.243 --> 00:50:12.577
I got stuck due to the
word sudnyata (for wisdom)

00:50:12.578 --> 00:50:20.050
We can call it as Sudnyata but in Sudnyata ...

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:24.150
but it (wisdom)  is more deeper than that ( Sudnyata)

00:50:24.163 --> 00:50:25.977
There are many things in it.

00:50:25.977 --> 00:50:29.750
In English, only one
word is there – wisdom.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:33.717
But we may call it as sudnyata
in our Marathi language.

00:50:33.717 --> 00:50:37.210
We could say subuddhi (wisdom),
samaysuchakta (presence of mind) or

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:43.197
dakshata (alertness).
Let’s call it dakshata. Dakshata.

00:50:43.197 --> 00:50:45.550
There are several words for it.

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:49.588
They all are easily
achievable by one thing

00:50:49.612 --> 00:50:58.600
if we manage to stay in the present.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.177
Now I have heard that people
quarrel a lot over here.

00:51:02.177 --> 00:51:04.680
Quarrels take place.
Why do they happen?

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:09.160
Because your father’s father
had beaten me so started quarreling.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.788
Now the father is dead, his father is
also dead

00:51:11.812 --> 00:51:17.280
– now you are in present .why to fight on those things?

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:24.628
Otherwise, I will beat you, I will hammer you –
keep saying something like this of the future.

00:51:24.652 --> 00:51:27.040
What am I going to do right now?

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.828
You came in front of me,

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:31.520
what am I going to do with you?

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.737
No such thinking.

00:51:32.737 --> 00:51:35.680
What should
be done at this time?

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.508
Whatever spontaneous
response one has at time,

00:51:39.532 --> 00:51:43.118
that presence of mind
is the one that matters.

00:51:43.142 --> 00:51:46.810
We will realize immediately that the
quarrel must be resolved right then.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:48.480
A good Chance.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:53.000
A good opportunity has come.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.148
When we say that this is the chance,

00:51:57.172 --> 00:52:02.737
then immediately the person
realizes what a good opportunity it is.

00:52:02.737 --> 00:52:06.680
So many quarrels of our ancestors
have come to an end.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.983
Why to make rounds of court?

00:52:09.983 --> 00:52:12.117
Why this, why that – Just end it.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:19.091
This sagacity that dwells on us, this timely
alertness is what is called as wisdom in English.

00:52:19.115 --> 00:52:21.000
But wisdom has many meanings.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.800
In our Marathi language
we have ten alternatives for each word.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.533
our Marathi language
is a very rich language.

00:52:29.543 --> 00:52:31.877
Hence we cannot
explain in one word.

00:52:31.897 --> 00:52:35.911
But still to be aware at that time,

00:52:35.935 --> 00:52:39.400
to have presence of mind at
that very moment is very essential.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.150
There are several other things.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.148
Suppose I have to start from my residence

00:52:43.172 --> 00:52:47.600
then I should think that as
I have to leave, what all things do I need?

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.200
Wherever I stay at night,
what do I need there? Just at that time.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.603
But it so happens that it does not strike at
that time. At that time, some other thoughts.

00:52:56.603 --> 00:53:03.360
Once you sit in the car you realize that
you have forgotten this or that thing.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.600
So to inculcate this presence of mind
( samay suchakta),

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:17.280
this wisdom , one should
learn to live in the present.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.760
Shivaji Maharaj was a great person
but he lived in the present.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.120
He was not like us.

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.853
We revere Shivaji Maharaj.

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:35.800
But in current times, what are the
qualities of Shivaji Maharaj that we have?

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:42.000
Did he drink, first thing?

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.037
How was his behavior?

00:53:44.037 --> 00:53:46.030
How was his character?

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:53.160
While we respect him, do we emulate
his lifestyle in our present day lives?

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.183
We give unnecessary
importance to past things.

00:53:56.183 --> 00:53:57.983
It is not going to benefit.

00:53:58.023 --> 00:54:01.405
We had Mahatma Gandhi, several others.

00:54:01.429 --> 00:54:04.897
it is said that several great
lotuses emerged in our country.

00:54:04.897 --> 00:54:09.050
But still it is a mere puddle.
All other persons are mere puddles.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:13.018
So we need to examine
if we are in a puddle or amongst lotuses.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:16.120
We should examine
where are we in these present times.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.588
Unless we acquire the wisdom to know this,

00:54:18.612 --> 00:54:22.960
till then Ganesha will not function in you.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.868
One attribute Ganesha has,

00:54:25.892 --> 00:54:30.120
is that he gives you sagacity, gives wisdom.

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.200
Do you see wisdom anywhere?

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:38.240
People quarrel right
in front of Shri Ganesh.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.912
They misappropriate money in the name
of Shri Ganesh, do this and do that.

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.748
Means there is no wisdom at all.
Then where is Ganapati at such a place,

00:54:45.772 --> 00:54:49.200
you have only installed Shri Ganesha.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:55:01.000
A person, who uses timely prudence at an
appropriate time, at an appropriate moment

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.600
his state will undergo
a significant change.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.428
You try this out

00:55:08.452 --> 00:55:12.320
and whatever growth you would achieve by being in
the present, will happen in the present itself.

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.348
Now consider a flower,

00:55:14.372 --> 00:55:20.560
does it grow in the future or in the past?

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.480
It will take place right now.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.590
This is the reason
why we do not progress.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:32.717
Because we think about
future or about past.

00:55:32.717 --> 00:55:36.000
But we do not
think of the present.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.440
We should examine
what our current state is.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:46.920
In that, all our problems
– such as rural issues- will get resolved.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.240
Suppose you have to do farming today, you
need to sow today-

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.674
You will say,last time

00:55:52.699 --> 00:55:55.960
I sowed, this happened, that happened;
if you keep on doing this way then it’s gone

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.612
or say , I will sow tomorrow
or day after – then you will lose that too.

00:55:58.612 --> 00:56:05.070
Whatever you need to do today,
you need to do, right at this moment.

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:11.520
This is a practice in India.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.080
To keep on talking
a lot about the past.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.800
This happened, that happened.
But what about you?

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.880
Where are you?

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.200
In Sahaja Yoga
it is very essential.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.320
‘Mataji has given us realization’
Then, what after that?

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:35.268
‘After that, nothing. Now that we have realization, we
are just sitting. Now we will pursue other pastimes.’

00:56:35.292 --> 00:56:45.440
Today, what do I need to do for that – if this thought
comes to you then you would benefit from it immediately?

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:50.963
Quite a lot people have achieved realization,
many have benefitted from it. Seen miracles.

00:56:50.963 --> 00:56:53.591
But they forget that ‘ I have achieved my
realization.’

00:56:53.615 --> 00:56:55.970
Every moment,’I have achieved realization’.

00:56:55.994 --> 00:56:58.028
Right at this moment, ‘I have achieved
realization ‘;

00:56:58.052 --> 00:57:00.240
they do not remember this thing.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.063
Then they start
behaving the same way.

00:57:02.063 --> 00:57:03.757
The other day, one
person came to me.

00:57:03.757 --> 00:57:05.090
I had already
given him realization.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:06.760
He had already achieved
awareness. Everything was fine.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.997
But he told me ‘Mataji, I feel very afraid
these days.’

00:57:08.997 --> 00:57:12.723
‘you are a Sahaja Yogi. What are you
afraid of? Have you forgotten?’

00:57:12.723 --> 00:57:17.110
‘Oh yes. I had forgotten. I
had achieved realization.

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:19.708
I should not be afraid of anything.’

00:57:19.732 --> 00:57:25.028
What can you say, even though everything
is bestowed on you, you just forgot

00:57:25.052 --> 00:57:29.731
and you still remember the
past when you were worthless,

00:57:29.755 --> 00:57:35.040
when you were incapable,
you did not understand anything.

00:57:35.646 --> 00:57:36.645
When you were ignorant

00:57:36.669 --> 00:57:40.400
or when you were
in the darkness or the

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:46.250
light of the Almighty had not entered you.
Why to carry forward the things of the past.

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.800
Why do you wish to
stick to old teachings?

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:49.990
They are still present.

00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:54.170
When I go to
villages, I give realization to villagers.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.590
Then they fall at my feet.

00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:01.390
Why? I am not a stone idol that
hundreds of people should fall at my feet.

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.443
Do not fall at my feet.

00:58:04.443 --> 00:58:07.400
Ok then ‘let me
offer some money.’ He offers ten paise.

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.748
I said, ‘but Mataji does not accept money.’
‘At least take 25 paise.’

00:58:11.772 --> 00:58:16.388
They will not understand
what the current situation is,

00:58:16.412 --> 00:58:20.751
and in this situation Mataji
does not accept money

00:58:20.775 --> 00:58:25.080
and nobody should offer
money in God’s name.

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.547
But it will not
penetrate their heads.

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:28.977
‘How is it possible, Mataji?

00:58:28.977 --> 00:58:33.108
Everyone tells us that as you have lost
your mother, donate me a cow

00:58:33.132 --> 00:58:36.388
and how come you are not
accepting money from us?’

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:40.365
So one should give up
this type of religious naivety.

00:58:40.389 --> 00:58:41.903
And how should this be done?

00:58:41.903 --> 00:58:46.600
Because the religion that
you have learnt, you have learnt it all wrong.

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.031
What you call as religion, you learnt
it the wrong way

00:58:49.055 --> 00:58:52.840
Because you want to purchase religion
and there are sellers for this too.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.973
Dharma (religion)
cannot be sold.

00:58:54.977 --> 00:58:58.480
There are
people who sell and you purchase it.

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.040
Means all three
things are in error.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:06.680
In the present
times, you have achieved self realization.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.800
Whatever you need to do,
is to be done on the strength of your atma.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.523
Instead, you
still pursue the practices of the past.

00:59:12.523 --> 00:59:15.348
‘This is our upbringing, Mataji’
‘Terrific.’

00:59:15.372 --> 00:59:18.108
Now a stone is placed on the road,

00:59:18.132 --> 00:59:22.320
shendur (red lead or vermillion powder) is
applied to the stone etc.etc. Someone sits there.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.880
Says – offer two paise,
four paise to the God.

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:32.817
If any person passes by, he thinks
it’s for religion so let’s offer two paise.

00:59:32.817 --> 00:59:35.137
Come on!! You are Sahaja
Yogis. Why are you offering?

00:59:35.137 --> 00:59:37.811
‘Now Mataji, It is like this. We
have been brought up this way.’

00:59:37.835 --> 00:59:40.320
What sort of misguided values these are?

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.120
Why do you offer?
Is it a God?

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.110
Any Tom Dick
and Harry will place a stone, is it God?

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:51.457
All such misguided
values within us will have to be removed.

00:59:51.457 --> 00:59:54.840
These can be removed only in one
way. Knowing what current situation is.

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:57.868
Otherwise, they will say,’
We believe in Ram’

00:59:57.892 --> 01:00:01.280
But now it is not Ram, it is me.
Listen to me.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.160
Why to believe in Ram?
Because they can manipulate HIM.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:10.080
Behave the way you want, consume liquor
and say that I am Rama’s devotee. Great.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.760
Ram is not going to question you.
But if you are my devotee then I will ask.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.617
That is why they
are apprehensive.

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:23.800
Oh no, no worshipping of Mataji – Because
Mataji is still alive. Will see after she takes nirakar form.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.377
No need to have faith till
she is alive as living persons question!

01:00:28.377 --> 01:00:31.705
They take to task-
Why did you behave in this manner?

01:00:31.723 --> 01:00:32.897
Have you understood?

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:36.948
Whatever Old fashioned beliefs
the people from rural areas have,

01:00:36.972 --> 01:00:41.397
you will realize how much of these are true and
how much are false when you embrace Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:41.397 --> 01:00:46.560
So we must realize that
as a result we have become very rotten.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.240
Not old fashioned.
Have decayed!

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.668
So whatever beliefs we have about ourselves,
whatever thoughts we have about religion

01:00:55.692 --> 01:00:58.717
these should also be examined.

01:00:58.717 --> 01:01:00.898
Now if you get rid of this, then there
is another one

01:01:00.922 --> 01:01:04.188
that we have become modern now.

01:01:04.212 --> 01:01:05.297
Is that so?

01:01:05.297 --> 01:01:06.737
What does it mean?

01:01:06.752 --> 01:01:10.080
We will not apply oils
to our heads as we have become modern.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.710
Becoming modern
means singing some obscene songs.

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:16.243
Sing filthy songs
in front of Ganapati.

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:19.550
What can we say?
They have become modern now!

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.883
Then they will say that we
 don’t believe in God.

01:01:21.883 --> 01:01:23.360
This is being modern.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.120
Means some got wasted due to that
and some due to this.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.520
What is the reason for this.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:36.130
Now a days kids observe their parents
are going, madly chanting Hari Hari.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:40.480
They did this birth after birth
but what did they get.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.480
So many join the Varkari
Panth (cult) daily.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.290
I tried to make them understand so many times,
to stop making varys (pilgrimage to holy places).

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:50.200
Receive right here what you wished
to get by making these pilgrimages.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.840
They do not understand this.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.640
It’s like being intoxicated on something.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.280
All of them go like a herd.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.800
Please accept this.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.043
I have brought
everything for you.

01:02:01.043 --> 01:02:02.200
Why don’t you take it?

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.657
This will not come
in their heads at all.

01:02:04.657 --> 01:02:07.705
‘But Mataji, our ancestors did the same thing.’

01:02:07.729 --> 01:02:12.680
‘Whatever they have done, the virtue
they have garnered, just take its benefits.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.228
Are you still accumulating the holy deeds?’

01:02:15.252 --> 01:02:19.451
What is the situation today?

01:02:19.475 --> 01:02:23.560
In the present era, Sahaja Yoga is the
religion; we should accept this religion.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.828
We should embrace this religion

01:02:26.852 --> 01:02:30.480
and by establishing ourselves in
this religion we should purify ourselves.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.760
Sahaja Yoga is the
essence of all religions.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.200
We believe in all religions,
not only in one religion.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.325
Because if you follow only one religion,

01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:41.920
it would mean that I am very good
and you are bad.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.243
That’s it, then start fighting.

01:02:44.243 --> 01:02:48.628
But if you learn to appreciate
the good things in all religions,

01:02:48.652 --> 01:02:51.578
then you will not fight.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:56.560
It is well known in Maharashtra
that family disputes &amp; attachments are very common.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.817
What is the reason behind it?

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:04.520
The reason is that we
recollect undesirable things.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.040
We recollect unwanted things.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.965
If someone says
leave it now,

01:03:10.989 --> 01:03:13.400
then ‘What are you telling!
Leave it? How come?

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.405
This is a very old dispute, how
can it be set aside?’

01:03:16.429 --> 01:03:20.549
Whatever that is oldish ;
we still cling to it and behave this way.

01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:22.562
Now family disputes or attachments are old things

01:03:22.562 --> 01:03:25.349
Leave them aside,
they are of no use.

01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:28.223
What
benefits did Maharashtra get from it?

01:03:28.223 --> 01:03:33.763
Now when I see our rural areas, I have
a feeling that the situation is serious.

01:03:33.763 --> 01:03:36.798
those who become modern, are indulging into drinking habits

01:03:36.822 --> 01:03:39.177
if not they get wasted in this way.

01:03:39.177 --> 01:03:42.080
So where does one
start Sahaja Yoga?

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.960
You cannot find even four
people who will understand these things.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.550
That is why I
say, protect your kids.

01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:54.183
At least take care of them.

01:03:54.183 --> 01:03:59.800
Tell them that without thinking
of past and future think of the present.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.610
This will bring
prosperity as well.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:06.217
If you are alert about
the present then prosperity will follow.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:10.588
To think of future is to build castles in
air, is not correct

01:04:10.612 --> 01:04:14.960
and to think of the past that has
immobilized you is also not correct.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:21.703
Hence you should come in the centre, should come
on the middle path, and should achieve balance.

01:04:21.703 --> 01:04:25.640
When you achieve a balanced state, you will see how
you become empowered and how much you can accomplish.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.357
Maharashtra is full of vibrations

01:04:28.357 --> 01:04:29.937
Because the worlds’ Kundalini is here.

01:04:29.937 --> 01:04:32.760
I am tired of explaining the
people from Maharashtra.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.950
They do not listen
to my counsel on this.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.160
They simply can’t
understand this thing.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.565
I am still so surprised that I am in
London

01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:44.322
and I keep on getting letters from Maharashtra.
This fellow is like this, that fellow is like that.

01:04:44.322 --> 01:04:48.000
I am sick of this and
I have closed my eyes.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.400
No end to this.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.360
People cannot see
good qualities in others.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.280
Actually all these people
are Sahaja Yogis.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.720
This is surprising.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.708
If Sahaja Yoga continues this way, tell me
what the Sadhus and saints will think about it?

01:05:03.732 --> 01:05:06.371
I came here to fulfill their tasks,

01:05:06.395 --> 01:05:11.037
took birth in your Maharashtra, I know
Marathi Language – everything is there ,

01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:14.943
still people do not understand what a
great thing I have brought.

01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:17.600
These people are here
from 55 countries.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.360
They came to this country.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.480
But what’s the use?

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.463
Does it have any effect on you?

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.950
Do you observe what
sort of people they are?

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:30.050
They came to your
country from abroad.

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:33.430
Why they are here,
What they have come for, do you see this?

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.828
What do they do?

01:05:34.852 --> 01:05:37.480
What are they so joyous about?

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.557
What have they achieved?

01:05:38.557 --> 01:05:40.108
We should also achieve likewise;

01:05:40.132 --> 01:05:46.498
this thought should come to
a normal and mature person.

01:05:46.522 --> 01:05:51.290
To have this understanding,
do only one thing.

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:54.400
Today we are sitting here, what should we do today?

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.690
What should be done right now?
What should be done at this time?

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:58.370
What is this time for?

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.280
This time itself is important.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.160
and that is what people don’t understand.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.680
That is why the confusion.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.880
So today, after remembering Ganesha,
we make a resolve in our minds

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:12.560
that we will
live in the present.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.880
I find it difficult when
I shift from one language to another.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.443
But I speak flawlessly
in one language.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:22.217
If I change the language
then it is difficult for me to changeover.

01:06:22.217 --> 01:06:26.210
If, while speaking in Hindi, someone asks to speak
in Marathi, then I fumble; from one to other.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:28.477
Then I keep on
searching for words.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.680
Because everything is pure; it has to be pure;
Can’t mix things.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.253
Even in language,
one must be flawless.

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:37.520
That is why I cannot do that.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.920
We must have
such purity in our lives.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.280
And that can be achieved only by one thing
that is, what am I doing at this time?

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.197
What am I thinking at this time?

01:06:45.197 --> 01:06:48.703
Even if you pay the slightest attention,
everything will change instantaneously.

01:06:48.703 --> 01:06:53.508
You will be surprised, you will get rid of
your habits, and everything will fall in place.

01:06:53.532 --> 01:06:57.840
The only thing that matters is,” what
am I doing at this time?”

01:06:57.852 --> 01:07:02.199
Do not feel bad about
what I say, I am the mother.

01:07:02.199 --> 01:07:03.932
I have told you the truth.

01:07:03.959 --> 01:07:06.425
Understand this
and improve your life.

01:07:06.452 --> 01:07:08.732
What is the condition
of our life today?

01:07:08.732 --> 01:07:13.959
How sad is the condition of our kids; that
should be seen, should pay attention to that.

01:07:13.959 --> 01:07:16.410
I am definitely going to come back.

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:17.680
Come back again
and again to Shere.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.750
Let at least Shere
village be uplifted.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.960
You all should help me in that.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.320
Adopt Sahaja Yoga and work hard.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:36.840
I will activate your Kundalini, but after activation
you need to set it properly with effort and diligence.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.828
So many people from other
countries got their realization,

01:07:39.852 --> 01:07:41.641
people who did not even know the name of
Ganapati,

01:07:41.665 --> 01:07:43.360
did not know the G of Ganapati.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.310
The mother earth
has placed the Ashta Vinaykas here.

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:50.320
We should see what we do, what our
state is – should focus on these things.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:08:03.690
This is a very important thing
that itself is going to bless our country.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:06.040
But first of all
at least bless yourself.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.200
It is so easy.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.510
Look how easy it is.

01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:13.663
I have not asked you to perform a difficult task
like standing on your head or go to the Himalayas.

01:08:13.663 --> 01:08:15.320
Nothing like that.
It’s a simple achievable thing.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.603
Do Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:16.603 --> 01:08:20.463
First get your Kundalini
activated and learn to live in the present.

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:21.483
That’s it.

01:08:21.483 --> 01:08:23.310
Then I will see what happens.

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:29.623
Hope that next time there will be no quarrels and everything
will be hunky dory and people will behave themselves.

01:08:29.623 --> 01:08:45.760
My eternal blessings to you all.
