WEBVTT

00:07.100 --> 00:09.933
We all have today gathered here

00:10.266 --> 00:13.849
on top of this beautiful mountain,

00:15.642 --> 00:19.266
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:20.642 --> 00:24.225
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

00:24.682 --> 00:30.642
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

00:32.517 --> 00:35.016
by which He showed

00:35.350 --> 00:38.682
that the spirit does not die.

00:39.682 --> 00:43.475
He was – He was the Omkara,

00:43.766 --> 00:48.225
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

00:49.016 --> 00:54.392
and that is why He could walk on the water.

00:55.517 --> 01:00.266
And also now we have made a film

01:00.808 --> 01:05.849
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

01:06.141 --> 01:09.392
which shows the carbon atom,

01:09.933 --> 01:13.682
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

01:14.058 --> 01:17.642
you find a proper swastika there;

01:17.933 --> 01:23.392
and left to the right we see Omkara.

01:23.724 --> 01:26.392
But when you see from down below upward,

01:26.682 --> 01:30.392
what you see is alpha and omega.

01:30.974 --> 01:35.266
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

01:35.600 --> 01:38.933
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

01:39.308 --> 01:45.808
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

01:46.849 --> 01:50.183
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

01:50.558 --> 01:56.183
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

01:57.642 --> 02:01.141
I don’t know at the time of Christ

02:01.517 --> 02:05.308
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

02:05.682 --> 02:07.933
but definitely to Him

02:08.350 --> 02:13.058
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

02:20.808 --> 02:26.100
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

02:26.683 --> 02:31.808
and very important for our ascent.

02:33.350 --> 02:36.724
If He had not resurrected Himself,

02:37.141 --> 02:41.266
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

02:41.891 --> 02:44.683
So it’s a great contribution.

02:45.183 --> 02:49.933
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

02:50.808 --> 02:53.891
what you were before

02:54.266 --> 02:57.475
and what you are today.

03:00.433 --> 03:03.392
It is such a change,

03:03.808 --> 03:05.933
such a difference,

03:06.225 --> 03:09.183
such a transformation.

03:10.058 --> 03:13.642
It is His own sacrifice

03:14.100 --> 03:15.558
on the cross

03:15.808 --> 03:19.558
and His own

03:20.016 --> 03:22.600
beautiful resurrection

03:22.891 --> 03:26.100
has created a way for all of us

03:26.433 --> 03:31.682
to get into this new transformed state.

03:36.392 --> 03:42.308
In this state is a different story for human beings,

03:42.682 --> 03:45.141
and a different for Christ.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.558
Christ was Himself

03:47.891 --> 03:52.058
was holiness, was purity.

03:53.517 --> 03:56.016
So His resurrection

03:56.308 --> 04:02.766
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

04:04.392 --> 04:08.266
because He did not need transformation,

04:09.891 --> 04:11.849
He did not

04:12.141 --> 04:16.642
have to go through any cleansing.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.433
But what happened in His case

04:22.100 --> 04:27.225
was that He became

04:28.682 --> 04:31.891
resurrected from death

04:32.392 --> 04:36.933
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

04:37.308 --> 04:39.891
is like a death;

04:40.266 --> 04:42.266
because they do everything

04:42.642 --> 04:48.225
without any understanding about the totality,

04:49.433 --> 04:51.600
about the reality,

04:51.933 --> 04:54.974
about the absolute truth.

04:55.308 --> 04:57.558
Whatever they do ultimately

04:57.974 --> 05:02.058
takes them to their destruction.

05:03.724 --> 05:07.058
Even the religions which are established

05:07.433 --> 05:09.517
by these great incarnations

05:09.891 --> 05:14.308
are absolutely on a decline.

05:14.683 --> 05:18.683
You do not find any trace of religious life

05:19.100 --> 05:20.600
with all those people

05:20.933 --> 05:23.808
who claim that they are the ones

05:24.141 --> 05:27.933
who can represent those incarnations.

05:28.642 --> 05:31.683
If you see in a subtle way

05:32.100 --> 05:34.016
it’s very painful also,

05:34.392 --> 05:38.517
that in the name of all these great incarnations

05:38.891 --> 05:41.433
the kind of work people are doing,

05:41.849 --> 05:46.392
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

05:46.724 --> 05:49.682
because they have no fear of God.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.183
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

05:53.475 --> 05:55.183
all over the world.

05:55.517 --> 05:56.600
Of course here,

05:56.891 --> 05:58.808
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.058
Everywhere people are seeing

06:01.475 --> 06:04.724
all these false things have been exposed.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.974
But these false things they have used

06:09.517 --> 06:13.433
under a garb of God,

06:13.724 --> 06:16.642
spirituality and beauty.

06:17.058 --> 06:20.266
That’s the best way you can hide.

06:21.308 --> 06:25.766
All the cruelty, all the violence,

06:26.683 --> 06:29.600
all the ugliness

06:30.517 --> 06:32.933
– this is how they have worked it out.

06:33.308 --> 06:37.016
And it has gone into such a state

06:37.433 --> 06:40.433
that you do not find the slightest

06:40.849 --> 06:45.308
even tinge of religious life among these people.

06:45.808 --> 06:47.724
Like all the thieves of the world,

06:48.058 --> 06:50.016
all the great crooks of the world

06:50.433 --> 06:54.016
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

06:56.266 --> 07:00.558
It’s only because what was written in all the books

07:00.891 --> 07:04.724
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

07:05.225 --> 07:07.683
was never done.

07:09.225 --> 07:12.682
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

07:13.058 --> 07:16.517
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

07:16.933 --> 07:19.308
He also said that “You are to be born again”

07:19.724 --> 07:22.600
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

07:22.974 --> 07:28.433
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.724
But they don’t think that actually

07:33.100 --> 07:35.683
what benevolence it has given them.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.933
At the most they might have made some money,

07:38.350 --> 07:41.724
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

07:42.100 --> 07:48.100
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.849
One must pity their insanity,

07:55.600 --> 07:59.308
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

07:59.682 --> 08:01.225
or to anybody else’s life

08:01.600 --> 08:05.933
of such a noble and a higher value system,

08:06.392 --> 08:12.433
and are doing all very low-graded things.

08:14.392 --> 08:19.600
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

08:20.183 --> 08:23.766
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

08:24.433 --> 08:28.475
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

08:28.849 --> 08:33.475
that you are coming from that environment,

08:34.558 --> 08:36.682
that style of life,

08:37.058 --> 08:39.308
that kind of thinking

08:39.682 --> 08:41.891
which was all for your destruction.

08:42.266 --> 08:46.558
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

08:47.058 --> 08:49.600
So when you’re coming out of it,

08:50.058 --> 08:53.058
still these things hang over,

08:53.475 --> 08:58.433
still you get affected by them.

08:58.974 --> 09:01.642
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

09:01.933 --> 09:05.225
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

09:05.558 --> 09:08.100
to some sort of a funny situation,

09:08.433 --> 09:13.891
to some sort of a degrading things.

09:14.517 --> 09:17.350
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

09:17.724 --> 09:20.600
sometimes you accept all that.

09:21.058 --> 09:23.392
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

09:23.682 --> 09:25.475
that after coming to realization

09:25.891 --> 09:28.891
he has to be very introspective.

09:29.308 --> 09:31.141
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

09:31.475 --> 09:35.266
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

09:35.808 --> 09:40.016
It’s very important that you have to know

09:40.433 --> 09:44.350
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

09:45.016 --> 09:49.225
Because Christ did not need this,

09:49.849 --> 09:53.558
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

09:54.058 --> 10:00.392
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

10:01.266 --> 10:07.558
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

10:07.891 --> 10:10.225
on the sense that from He died

10:10.682 --> 10:13.724
and then He resurrected Himself.

10:14.183 --> 10:17.433
But for us it is very different.

10:17.849 --> 10:20.849
We are now Sahaja yogis,

10:21.225 --> 10:24.724
but we were ordinary human beings.

10:25.141 --> 10:27.600
We had no light within us.

10:27.974 --> 10:30.016
Now the light comes within us

10:30.392 --> 10:32.682
and we see the light,

10:33.016 --> 10:36.392
then what do we become?

10:36.766 --> 10:40.266
We have to become the light itself.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.433
Christ was the light.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.350
He did not have to become.

10:44.683 --> 10:46.683
So we have to become the light.

10:46.974 --> 10:50.891
And now you have to guard on

10:51.766 --> 10:55.350
the way this light might get disturbed,

10:55.683 --> 11:01.016
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

11:02.683 --> 11:07.141
So carrying on yourself with this light,

11:07.475 --> 11:09.849
first thing you should know that

11:10.266 --> 11:12.517
if you see the light, is not proper

11:12.849 --> 11:14.183
– means you are not the light.

11:14.558 --> 11:18.016
You have to become the light.

11:19.308 --> 11:20.849
When you are the light,

11:21.308 --> 11:23.891
then in that light you can easily see

11:24.225 --> 11:26.724
how your mind works,

11:27.225 --> 11:29.308
what ideas it gives,

11:29.683 --> 11:36.225
what affects your mind

11:36.933 --> 11:38.891
while you’re ascending.

11:39.225 --> 11:41.141
Is this the worry

11:41.433 --> 11:46.933
or is this the responsibility that you have?

11:47.308 --> 11:51.558
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

11:51.974 --> 11:53.724
that there is an impediment

11:54.100 --> 11:59.225
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

11:59.933 --> 12:02.682
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

12:03.058 --> 12:08.058
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

12:09.558 --> 12:12.558
It’s a very beautiful journey

12:12.933 --> 12:14.642
– very, very beautiful journey.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.308
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

12:17.682 --> 12:22.308
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

12:23.475 --> 12:28.558
the journey of kundalini.

12:30.642 --> 12:38.266
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

12:39.933 --> 12:44.642
Basically you were not a realized soul,

12:45.225 --> 12:47.891
but now you are a realized soul.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.266
You are a evolved state.

12:50.724 --> 12:56.475
Now what is missing is the idea

12:56.933 --> 13:01.891
that we are absolutely all right

13:02.392 --> 13:06.683
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

13:08.100 --> 13:12.724
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

13:13.225 --> 13:15.891
it’s not going to help you at all.

13:16.392 --> 13:19.392
What you have to do is to

13:20.183 --> 13:22.016
all the time introspect yourself.

13:22.433 --> 13:24.600
That’s what is meditation for,

13:24.974 --> 13:26.517
to see for yourself

13:26.849 --> 13:30.974
how you are keeping up

13:31.475 --> 13:34.642
your spiritual ascent.

13:35.141 --> 13:36.558
No one else can do it,

13:36.974 --> 13:39.392
it’s your own individual work.

13:39.682 --> 13:41.642
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

13:41.891 --> 13:44.683
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.808
They may not say, they may not refer it,

13:49.225 --> 13:50.682
but they will know definitely

13:51.058 --> 13:52.808
that such-and-such chakra is catching

13:53.225 --> 13:55.141
and this person has this problem.

13:55.558 --> 14:00.266
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

14:01.808 --> 14:04.766
what is their problem is.

14:05.308 --> 14:07.225
So if somebody tells you

14:07.600 --> 14:09.475
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

14:09.766 --> 14:12.475
you should never, never feel bad about it,

14:12.808 --> 14:15.517
because by keeping that chakra intact

14:15.808 --> 14:18.724
you are ruining your own life.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.682
So what you have to do is to see

14:22.058 --> 14:23.808
that if somebody tells you that

14:24.183 --> 14:28.100
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

14:28.475 --> 14:31.058
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

14:31.475 --> 14:34.058
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

14:34.433 --> 14:36.600
there’s something wrong with your face,

14:36.891 --> 14:38.308
you can immediately correct it.

14:38.682 --> 14:42.308
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

14:42.683 --> 14:46.100
you have to be mature enough that you should know

14:46.433 --> 14:48.100
that it is a great blessing

14:48.517 --> 14:51.600
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.266
Like the other day there was some quarrel

14:54.600 --> 14:56.016
between the two leaders.

14:56.392 --> 14:58.849
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

14:59.141 --> 15:00.433
There should not be.

15:00.642 --> 15:04.225
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

15:04.600 --> 15:05.891
two legs do not fight.

15:06.266 --> 15:09.183
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

15:09.600 --> 15:13.724
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

15:14.517 --> 15:17.308
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

15:17.682 --> 15:22.266
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

15:22.766 --> 15:26.308
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

15:26.766 --> 15:28.974
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

15:29.392 --> 15:30.974
When he puts his hand towards Me,

15:31.392 --> 15:34.266
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

15:34.600 --> 15:36.808
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

15:37.183 --> 15:41.016
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

15:41.392 --> 15:43.517
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

15:43.849 --> 15:47.558
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

15:48.392 --> 15:53.642
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

15:54.016 --> 15:56.558
because I said it to him.

15:57.183 --> 16:00.141
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

16:00.642 --> 16:02.475
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

16:02.891 --> 16:03.933
what is good for him.

16:04.225 --> 16:05.683
He did not feel bad at all.

16:06.058 --> 16:08.183
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

16:08.558 --> 16:11.350
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

16:11.724 --> 16:16.100
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

16:23.100 --> 16:26.683
Now, the problem with us is that

16:27.016 --> 16:31.308
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

16:32.392 --> 16:34.808
and we have consolidated it.

16:35.308 --> 16:37.308
Also, we have a great collective force,

16:37.683 --> 16:40.183
I can see, in every country.

16:40.642 --> 16:43.350
We can give realizations to so many,

16:43.808 --> 16:46.350
and we can really establish

16:46.766 --> 16:51.475
all these great truths in our lives.

16:51.891 --> 16:53.308
We can do it.

16:53.642 --> 16:57.183
All the time we should establish them.

16:57.974 --> 17:01.350
But there is one point

17:01.724 --> 17:04.808
on which one should not be very sure:

17:05.266 --> 17:11.433
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

17:12.433 --> 17:15.100
You have to be careful on this point very much.

17:15.517 --> 17:21.308
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

17:21.683 --> 17:26.392
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

17:27.475 --> 17:30.808
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.600
The reason is that they have no faith

17:34.974 --> 17:41.558
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

17:42.849 --> 17:45.642
This is the faith which is missing.

17:46.225 --> 17:50.849
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

17:51.433 --> 17:55.808
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

17:57.558 --> 18:04.141
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

18:07.058 --> 18:11.849
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

18:12.183 --> 18:13.974
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

18:14.308 --> 18:16.392
– you have known that it is so.

18:16.724 --> 18:18.392
But even knowing that,

18:18.724 --> 18:22.225
it has not become such a faith within you.

18:22.683 --> 18:26.475
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

18:26.891 --> 18:29.350
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

18:29.682 --> 18:31.183
not the blind faith.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.016
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

18:35.558 --> 18:39.558
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

18:39.849 --> 18:44.808
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

18:45.266 --> 18:47.433
There cannot be any problems

18:47.808 --> 18:51.266
if your faith is enlightened.

18:52.808 --> 18:54.933
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

18:55.350 --> 18:58.766
many people who are very steady,

19:00.682 --> 19:03.683
who are upright,

19:04.308 --> 19:06.558
who are very valuable.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.891
They are like the people

19:09.266 --> 19:12.433
who know they are standing on the rocks.

19:12.974 --> 19:17.016
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

19:17.308 --> 19:20.433
they think they are still dwindling

19:20.808 --> 19:26.517
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

19:28.642 --> 19:32.724
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

19:33.183 --> 19:37.350
and also that has come out of faith

19:37.683 --> 19:40.849
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

19:41.308 --> 19:43.849
nothing can trouble us.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.683
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

19:48.100 --> 19:49.766
I mean, He knew everything,

19:50.141 --> 19:52.183
so He was sure about it.

19:52.682 --> 19:56.350
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

19:56.849 --> 20:00.392
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

20:00.808 --> 20:03.433
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

20:03.849 --> 20:06.600
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

20:06.974 --> 20:08.849
It is so.

20:09.308 --> 20:13.517
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

20:13.974 --> 20:17.350
while the other people,

20:20.058 --> 20:21.974
even Sahaja yogis,

20:22.350 --> 20:25.642
have to become like Christ

20:25.974 --> 20:28.891
as far as the faith is concerned.

20:29.475 --> 20:33.849
This faith is to be understood.

20:34.724 --> 20:37.475
This is an enlightened faith.

20:37.891 --> 20:42.183
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

20:42.600 --> 20:45.058
He went into all kinds of things,

20:45.517 --> 20:49.475
just because He knew it was just a drama

20:49.808 --> 20:54.100
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

20:54.558 --> 20:57.849
and there’s nothing serious,

20:58.808 --> 21:00.016
nothing is going to matter,

21:00.350 --> 21:01.849
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

21:02.225 --> 21:04.475
He played the drama.

21:04.974 --> 21:08.433
To Him it was nothing very serious.

21:10.849 --> 21:14.682
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

21:15.308 --> 21:19.433
He also in His heart knew everything that

21:19.808 --> 21:23.808
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

21:24.517 --> 21:28.682
But at the same time,

21:29.683 --> 21:32.600
He was the embodiment of faith:

21:33.100 --> 21:37.600
faith in Himself

21:37.933 --> 21:41.682
and in this all-pervading Power.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.392
This never lets you down,

21:45.849 --> 21:50.766
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

21:51.475 --> 21:56.225
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

21:57.475 --> 22:01.558
naturally I will give him all the work,

22:02.141 --> 22:04.475
I will trust everything,

22:04.891 --> 22:07.808
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

22:08.141 --> 22:11.433
never doubt such a person.

22:12.600 --> 22:17.849
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

22:18.517 --> 22:25.308
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

22:26.100 --> 22:30.225
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

22:32.016 --> 22:33.808
how life will improve

22:34.266 --> 22:39.392
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

22:39.933 --> 22:42.225
You’ll have no doubts,

22:42.600 --> 22:47.350
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

22:49.974 --> 22:54.141
So, this is such a state

22:54.682 --> 22:56.392
– only with faith.

22:56.891 --> 22:59.642
But now this faith, how do you get?

23:00.058 --> 23:04.225
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.016
There’s no course about it,

23:06.433 --> 23:08.225
there’s no literature about it,

23:08.600 --> 23:10.849
there’s no lecture about it.

23:11.266 --> 23:16.724
But there is an awakening within you

23:17.183 --> 23:21.225
which will ask this

23:21.808 --> 23:24.266
“What am I?” – this awakening,

23:24.642 --> 23:27.058
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

23:27.433 --> 23:32.891
You see, this will question

23:34.974 --> 23:38.766
“What is it that I have achieved?

23:39.183 --> 23:42.433
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

23:42.891 --> 23:45.475
All these questions will come to you.

23:45.974 --> 23:48.016
But if you have faith,

23:48.475 --> 23:50.849
not the blind but the enlightened

23:51.308 --> 23:53.808
which is established by many miracles in life,

23:54.183 --> 23:55.308
many things in life;

23:55.682 --> 23:58.475
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

23:58.808 --> 24:00.016
small, small things.

24:00.350 --> 24:02.433
There have been miracles even in big things,

24:02.808 --> 24:06.558
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

24:06.974 --> 24:08.600
So now you know, very well settled,

24:09.016 --> 24:12.517
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

24:12.849 --> 24:15.600
For example, it starts raining.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.183
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

24:19.600 --> 24:22.225
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

24:22.600 --> 24:23.808
nothing can happen.

24:24.183 --> 24:26.350
Let it rain as much as it likes.

24:26.724 --> 24:30.475
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

24:30.891 --> 24:32.558
it’s not going to drench us.

24:32.891 --> 24:38.058
In the same way this faith within us

24:38.433 --> 24:42.141
has to be absolutely solid,

24:42.891 --> 24:46.808
and that makes you extremely strong

24:47.266 --> 24:49.683
and makes you responsible

24:50.058 --> 24:52.308
for the resurrection of thousands

24:52.642 --> 24:57.100
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

25:02.517 --> 25:06.517
This kind of life that we have

25:07.933 --> 25:13.600
– that only by our own establishment,

25:14.058 --> 25:17.683
by our own understanding,

25:18.141 --> 25:23.724
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

25:24.766 --> 25:27.308
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

25:28.517 --> 25:31.891
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

25:32.308 --> 25:36.475
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

25:36.974 --> 25:41.100
You all should have the chance

25:41.682 --> 25:45.266
to know your spirit

25:45.724 --> 25:49.891
and to know yourself.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.350
So one has to have faith in oneself.

25:53.808 --> 25:56.016
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

25:56.433 --> 25:59.392
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

25:59.724 --> 26:03.766
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

26:07.016 --> 26:10.849
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

26:11.724 --> 26:14.475
What do you want?

26:14.891 --> 26:19.141
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

26:21.100 --> 26:23.100
even if you don’t ask.

26:23.558 --> 26:29.058
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

26:29.642 --> 26:32.974
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

26:33.475 --> 26:36.016
because this all-pervading Power

26:36.558 --> 26:38.141
is the only real power,

26:38.517 --> 26:41.433
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

26:42.266 --> 26:49.016
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

26:49.683 --> 26:56.766
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

26:58.141 --> 27:01.433
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

27:01.849 --> 27:03.517
and he was deceived by someone

27:03.933 --> 27:06.350
and made him buy a land and a house

27:06.766 --> 27:10.682
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

27:11.141 --> 27:12.058
And this fellow said,

27:12.350 --> 27:13.891
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

27:14.266 --> 27:15.974
they will not say anything to you.”

27:16.308 --> 27:18.682
He believed him – had wrong faith,

27:18.974 --> 27:22.683
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

27:23.016 --> 27:28.558
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

27:30.682 --> 27:35.517
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

27:38.308 --> 27:42.016
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

27:42.433 --> 27:45.350
and so many people came and saw all this.

27:45.766 --> 27:49.891
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

27:50.308 --> 27:51.558
he could not understand,

27:51.974 --> 27:53.558
“Why it has happened to me

27:53.974 --> 27:57.933
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

27:59.724 --> 28:01.600
And he was deceived and he was,

28:02.266 --> 28:04.600
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.766
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

28:09.308 --> 28:12.600
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

28:12.974 --> 28:19.183
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

28:20.933 --> 28:25.225
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

28:25.642 --> 28:28.724
That’s all – “Have faith.”

28:29.350 --> 28:31.433
And what a miraculous thing happened,

28:31.808 --> 28:36.558
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

28:39.682 --> 28:41.517
And that fellow said,

28:41.974 --> 28:44.933
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

28:45.392 --> 28:48.350
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

28:48.766 --> 28:52.600
that I want to pay.”

28:53.766 --> 28:58.891
It’s something unbelievable.

29:01.100 --> 29:04.517
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

29:04.891 --> 29:09.100
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

29:09.392 --> 29:12.225
Nothing worked out, nothing

29:12.724 --> 29:14.724
– only his faith.

29:15.183 --> 29:18.849
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

29:19.517 --> 29:20.808
He was supposed to go to jail,

29:21.183 --> 29:22.475
now he’s going to become a rich man.

29:22.849 --> 29:25.266
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.266
This is just the financial side of it,

29:27.642 --> 29:28.475
but I know you know

29:28.808 --> 29:30.724
that there are so many other miracles happening.

29:31.225 --> 29:35.350
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

29:35.766 --> 29:39.183
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

29:39.682 --> 29:43.266
After realization at least you should take to faith.

29:43.933 --> 29:46.600
That really is something surprising

29:46.933 --> 29:49.016
that people get their realization and everything,

29:49.475 --> 29:53.766
still they do not have faith in themselves.

29:54.350 --> 29:59.600
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

30:00.392 --> 30:04.974
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

30:05.350 --> 30:08.016
faith was part and parcel of His being.

30:08.517 --> 30:13.225
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

30:13.891 --> 30:16.808
Now we have to have it.

30:17.392 --> 30:21.058
We have to believe in ourselves.

30:21.724 --> 30:23.766
There’s so many incidents I can give you

30:24.308 --> 30:26.642
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

30:27.058 --> 30:31.058
where just the faith has helped.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.808
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

30:35.308 --> 30:37.475
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

30:37.849 --> 30:40.058
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

30:40.558 --> 30:44.225
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

30:44.517 --> 30:46.682
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

30:46.974 --> 30:48.308
She said it three times.

30:48.682 --> 30:50.642
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

30:50.974 --> 30:53.266
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

30:53.600 --> 30:55.350
She just got up, walked out.

30:55.724 --> 30:58.225
And then she started running all the way,

30:58.642 --> 31:00.600
and everybody started laughing.

31:00.933 --> 31:02.642
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

31:03.016 --> 31:05.266
I said, “But see her faith!”

31:05.933 --> 31:11.808
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

31:12.766 --> 31:19.141
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

31:20.308 --> 31:22.849
They have shown faith in that person.

31:23.225 --> 31:24.683
As I have told you always,

31:25.016 --> 31:28.016
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

31:28.475 --> 31:30.100
One among hundred might deceive us

31:30.392 --> 31:31.891
doesn’t matter, we trust.

31:32.266 --> 31:36.016
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

31:36.433 --> 31:38.225
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

31:38.682 --> 31:41.517
But what about deities?

31:41.974 --> 31:44.849
You show faith in them and it works,

31:45.266 --> 31:46.600
immediately they work out.

31:47.016 --> 31:48.266
Like Guido told Me that

31:48.642 --> 31:51.392
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

31:51.891 --> 31:53.558
for these two days.”

31:53.974 --> 31:58.058
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

31:59.308 --> 32:02.141
It disappeared.

32:02.600 --> 32:08.141
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

32:10.766 --> 32:14.974
And when we talk of faith, you know,

32:15.808 --> 32:21.266
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

32:22.392 --> 32:27.100
which organizes, which knows everything,

32:27.642 --> 32:29.724
which is so intelligent, efficient

32:30.141 --> 32:31.682
– above all, it loves you.

32:32.058 --> 32:35.141
And then you show faith.

32:36.683 --> 32:43.808
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

32:45.058 --> 32:49.766
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

32:50.392 --> 32:51.683
They don’t feel then bad,

32:52.100 --> 32:54.808
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

32:55.183 --> 32:57.683
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

32:58.058 --> 33:01.141
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

33:01.558 --> 33:04.058
whether this thing happens or not.

33:04.558 --> 33:08.475
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

33:08.933 --> 33:10.141
Supposing you are lost on the way,

33:10.517 --> 33:13.808
know that it has to be that way.

33:14.642 --> 33:18.350
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

33:18.724 --> 33:20.266
He was to be crucified.

33:20.682 --> 33:22.100
He had to carry the cross,

33:22.558 --> 33:26.058
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

33:26.558 --> 33:28.475
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

33:28.808 --> 33:31.350
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

33:31.766 --> 33:35.724
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

33:36.266 --> 33:39.266
But this faith in Him gave Him

33:39.558 --> 33:44.766
such a tremendous powers.

33:46.183 --> 33:47.891
He could have done anything.

33:48.308 --> 33:50.392
He could have killed all these people

33:50.683 --> 33:54.308
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

33:54.682 --> 33:56.642
Just one glance could have killed them.

33:57.058 --> 34:00.100
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

34:00.433 --> 34:01.642
He went through it.

34:01.974 --> 34:05.475
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

34:05.849 --> 34:08.683
He is the one who won everything.

34:09.392 --> 34:11.225
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

34:11.600 --> 34:13.433
has to look at one’s own life.

34:13.849 --> 34:20.225
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

34:21.141 --> 34:25.266
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

34:25.766 --> 34:27.682
In the evolutionary process

34:28.100 --> 34:31.642
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

34:32.225 --> 34:38.475
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

34:38.974 --> 34:41.517
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

34:41.933 --> 34:44.683
most of the people are not going to be there.

34:45.141 --> 34:46.600
Not that we are not available,

34:47.016 --> 34:52.682
but because they are not fated

34:53.266 --> 34:54.933
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

34:55.266 --> 34:57.558
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

34:57.933 --> 34:59.475
So, you are so fortunate

34:59.849 --> 35:03.724
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.100
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

35:07.517 --> 35:11.933
in your resurrection that is your being now.

35:12.433 --> 35:15.475
And with that you will know how precious

35:15.849 --> 35:18.642
you are for the whole world,

35:19.016 --> 35:21.141
and that what you have to do is not

35:21.475 --> 35:24.225
to think of material gains, physical gains

35:24.682 --> 35:29.933
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

35:30.808 --> 35:35.350
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

35:35.849 --> 35:37.891
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

35:38.266 --> 35:40.517
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

35:40.891 --> 35:41.974
everything works out,

35:42.475 --> 35:46.141
everything in its own time shows its own results.

35:48.308 --> 35:52.100
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

35:52.600 --> 35:57.642
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

36:00.683 --> 36:06.600
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

36:06.933 --> 36:08.433
“All right, Mother says so.

36:08.766 --> 36:11.974
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

36:12.558 --> 36:14.225
Like the other day I had a journalist,

36:14.683 --> 36:17.642
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

36:18.016 --> 36:19.016
I said, “Why?”

36:19.350 --> 36:23.683
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

36:24.100 --> 36:26.058
How can there be a blind child,

36:26.350 --> 36:28.849
how can this and how can that?”

36:29.308 --> 36:31.766
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

36:32.058 --> 36:33.891
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

36:34.308 --> 36:37.600
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

36:37.849 --> 36:42.891
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

36:43.266 --> 36:47.766
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

36:49.266 --> 36:52.600
So the situation is explainable;

36:53.016 --> 36:57.475
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

36:58.183 --> 37:01.933
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

37:02.350 --> 37:04.225
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

37:04.683 --> 37:08.642
have you any problems? None.”

37:11.475 --> 37:13.683
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

37:14.100 --> 37:17.891
Now if you say that there is a way out

37:18.350 --> 37:21.350
and that there is a solution,

37:21.766 --> 37:24.808
and that a time can come

37:25.141 --> 37:28.058
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

37:28.475 --> 37:31.849
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

37:33.682 --> 37:35.350
so why not see this?

37:35.724 --> 37:39.433
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

37:40.724 --> 37:44.682
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

37:46.350 --> 37:48.517
So this kind of negative attitude

37:48.891 --> 37:51.016
also Sahaja yogis can have.

37:51.475 --> 37:53.724
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

37:54.183 --> 37:56.682
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

37:56.974 --> 38:00.225
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

38:00.766 --> 38:05.225
You can cure, your faith can cure.

38:05.724 --> 38:08.558
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

38:08.933 --> 38:10.183
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

38:10.682 --> 38:14.308
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

38:14.682 --> 38:16.933
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

38:17.433 --> 38:21.849
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

38:22.266 --> 38:25.058
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

38:25.517 --> 38:28.266
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

38:28.600 --> 38:30.766
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

38:31.183 --> 38:32.642
Third day he was out of hospital,

38:32.891 --> 38:35.100
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

38:35.517 --> 38:39.100
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

38:39.517 --> 38:41.724
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

38:42.100 --> 38:44.392
the deities have to work it out.

38:44.849 --> 38:48.016
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

38:48.558 --> 38:51.392
It’s the deities who stood by it.

38:55.350 --> 39:01.808
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

39:02.600 --> 39:08.600
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

39:09.350 --> 39:12.849
Why not we develop that complete faith

39:13.350 --> 39:15.225
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

39:15.642 --> 39:18.600
we are in the Kingdom of God,

39:19.100 --> 39:23.350
and that this Power is going to look after us?

39:23.891 --> 39:26.475
Then we’ll have no choices,

39:26.933 --> 39:32.808
we’ll have no hesitation.

39:33.683 --> 39:37.225
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

39:37.642 --> 39:40.100
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

39:40.517 --> 39:42.682
or go anywhere – so what?

39:43.141 --> 39:46.350
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

39:46.724 --> 39:49.350
it’s perfectly all right.

39:49.891 --> 39:52.266
And no worry of any kind.

39:52.683 --> 39:55.225
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

39:55.558 --> 39:57.974
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

39:58.350 --> 40:00.100
Everything drops out.

40:00.517 --> 40:01.808
Doesn’t matter.

40:02.225 --> 40:05.100
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

40:05.558 --> 40:09.350
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

40:09.808 --> 40:10.766
Like people tell Me,

40:11.100 --> 40:12.475
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

40:12.808 --> 40:15.600
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

40:15.849 --> 40:18.433
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

40:18.891 --> 40:20.016
only the seat is changed.

40:20.433 --> 40:22.683
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

40:23.058 --> 40:27.808
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

40:29.266 --> 40:35.392
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

40:35.933 --> 40:38.475
then you don’t bother.

40:38.933 --> 40:41.392
Many people will find out whether

40:41.724 --> 40:44.141
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

40:44.517 --> 40:49.058
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

40:51.558 --> 40:53.974
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

40:54.392 --> 40:58.016
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

40:58.517 --> 41:01.392
Nothing can bind you,

41:01.849 --> 41:03.600
nothing can pull you down,

41:03.933 --> 41:07.766
no habit can come back on you;

41:09.766 --> 41:15.058
because faith will purify you completely,

41:15.642 --> 41:18.683
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

41:19.183 --> 41:22.974
This faith is not something

41:23.433 --> 41:25.058
that can be put into your heads

41:25.475 --> 41:29.058
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

41:29.766 --> 41:34.600
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

41:35.308 --> 41:40.308
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

41:40.933 --> 41:45.517
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

41:46.642 --> 41:48.642
would be established,

41:49.100 --> 41:50.808
would be effective,

41:51.225 --> 41:56.600
and for the whole world will be a model.

41:58.183 --> 42:01.766
May God bless you all.

42:34.558 --> 42:39.058
There are just the children, there are so many children.

42:42.141 --> 42:43.642
Today is the day of Christ,

42:43.933 --> 42:48.100
so we should have children in any case to wash My feet.

42:49.891 --> 42:54.392
Can you fit it there, or you will have to move it?
