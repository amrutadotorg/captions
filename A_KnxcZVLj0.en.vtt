00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.933
We all have today gathered here

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.849
on top of this beautiful mountain,

00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:19.266
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:24.225
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:30.642
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:35.016
by which He showed

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.682
that the spirit does not die.

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:43.475
He was – He was the Omkara,

00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:48.225
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:54.392
and that is why He could walk on the water.

00:00:55.517 --> 00:01:00.266
And also now we have made a film

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:05.849
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:09.392
which shows the carbon atom,

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:13.682
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:17.642
you find a proper swastika there;

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:23.392
and left to the right we see Omkara.

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:26.392
But when you see from down below upward,

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:30.392
what you see is alpha and omega.

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:35.266
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.933
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:45.808
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.183
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:56.183
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

00:01:57.642 --> 00:02:01.141
I don’t know at the time of Christ

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:05.308
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.933
but definitely to Him

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.058
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:26.100
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:31.808
and very important for our ascent.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.724
If He had not resurrected Himself,

00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:41.266
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:44.683
So it’s a great contribution.

00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:49.933
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:53.891
what you were before

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:57.475
and what you are today.

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.392
It is such a change,

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:05.933
such a difference,

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:09.183
such a transformation.

00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:13.642
It is His own sacrifice

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.558
on the cross

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:19.558
and His own

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:22.600
beautiful resurrection

00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:26.100
has created a way for all of us

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:31.682
to get into this new transformed state.

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:42.308
In this state is a different story for human beings,

00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:45.141
and a different for Christ.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.558
Christ was Himself

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:52.058
was holiness, was purity.

00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.016
So His resurrection

00:03:56.308 --> 00:04:02.766
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

00:04:04.392 --> 00:04:08.266
because He did not need transformation,

00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:11.849
He did not

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:16.642
have to go through any cleansing.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.433
But what happened in His case

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.225
was that He became

00:04:28.682 --> 00:04:31.891
resurrected from death

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:36.933
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

00:04:37.308 --> 00:04:39.891
is like a death;

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:42.266
because they do everything

00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:48.225
without any understanding about the totality,

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.600
about the reality,

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:54.974
about the absolute truth.

00:04:55.308 --> 00:04:57.558
Whatever they do ultimately

00:04:57.974 --> 00:05:02.058
takes them to their destruction.

00:05:03.724 --> 00:05:07.058
Even the religions which are established

00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:09.517
by these great incarnations

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:14.308
are absolutely on a decline.

00:05:14.683 --> 00:05:18.683
You do not find any trace of religious life

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.600
with all those people

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:23.808
who claim that they are the ones

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:27.933
who can represent those incarnations.

00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:31.683
If you see in a subtle way

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.016
it’s very painful also,

00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:38.517
that in the name of all these great incarnations

00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:41.433
the kind of work people are doing,

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.392
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:49.682
because they have no fear of God.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:53.183
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:55.183
all over the world.

00:05:55.517 --> 00:05:56.600
Of course here,

00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.808
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:01.058
Everywhere people are seeing

00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:04.724
all these false things have been exposed.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.974
But these false things they have used

00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:13.433
under a garb of God,

00:06:13.724 --> 00:06:16.642
spirituality and beauty.

00:06:17.058 --> 00:06:20.266
That’s the best way you can hide.

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:25.766
All the cruelty, all the violence,

00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:29.600
all the ugliness

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.933
– this is how they have worked it out.

00:06:33.308 --> 00:06:37.016
And it has gone into such a state

00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:40.433
that you do not find the slightest

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.308
even tinge of religious life among these people.

00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:47.724
Like all the thieves of the world,

00:06:48.058 --> 00:06:50.016
all the great crooks of the world

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:54.016
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

00:06:56.266 --> 00:07:00.558
It’s only because what was written in all the books

00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:04.724
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.683
was never done.

00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:12.682
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.517
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:19.308
He also said that “You are to be born again”

00:07:19.724 --> 00:07:22.600
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:28.433
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.724
But they don’t think that actually

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.683
what benevolence it has given them.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.933
At the most they might have made some money,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.724
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.100
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.849
One must pity their insanity,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.308
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

00:07:59.682 --> 00:08:01.225
or to anybody else’s life

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.933
of such a noble and a higher value system,

00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:12.433
and are doing all very low-graded things.

00:08:14.392 --> 00:08:19.600
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:23.766
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

00:08:24.433 --> 00:08:28.475
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:33.475
that you are coming from that environment,

00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:36.682
that style of life,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.308
that kind of thinking

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:41.891
which was all for your destruction.

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:46.558
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

00:08:47.058 --> 00:08:49.600
So when you’re coming out of it,

00:08:50.058 --> 00:08:53.058
still these things hang over,

00:08:53.475 --> 00:08:58.433
still you get affected by them.

00:08:58.974 --> 00:09:01.642
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

00:09:01.933 --> 00:09:05.225
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:08.100
to some sort of a funny situation,

00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:13.891
to some sort of a degrading things.

00:09:14.517 --> 00:09:17.350
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.600
sometimes you accept all that.

00:09:21.058 --> 00:09:23.392
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

00:09:23.682 --> 00:09:25.475
that after coming to realization

00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.891
he has to be very introspective.

00:09:29.308 --> 00:09:31.141
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:35.266
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:40.016
It’s very important that you have to know

00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:44.350
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

00:09:45.016 --> 00:09:49.225
Because Christ did not need this,

00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:53.558
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

00:09:54.058 --> 00:10:00.392
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:07.558
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:10.225
on the sense that from He died

00:10:10.682 --> 00:10:13.724
and then He resurrected Himself.

00:10:14.183 --> 00:10:17.433
But for us it is very different.

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:20.849
We are now Sahaja yogis,

00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:24.724
but we were ordinary human beings.

00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:27.600
We had no light within us.

00:10:27.974 --> 00:10:30.016
Now the light comes within us

00:10:30.392 --> 00:10:32.682
and we see the light,

00:10:33.016 --> 00:10:36.392
then what do we become?

00:10:36.766 --> 00:10:40.266
We have to become the light itself.

00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:42.433
Christ was the light.

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.350
He did not have to become.

00:10:44.683 --> 00:10:46.683
So we have to become the light.

00:10:46.974 --> 00:10:50.891
And now you have to guard on

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:55.350
the way this light might get disturbed,

00:10:55.683 --> 00:11:01.016
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

00:11:02.683 --> 00:11:07.141
So carrying on yourself with this light,

00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:09.849
first thing you should know that

00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:12.517
if you see the light, is not proper

00:11:12.849 --> 00:11:14.183
– means you are not the light.

00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:18.016
You have to become the light.

00:11:19.308 --> 00:11:20.849
When you are the light,

00:11:21.308 --> 00:11:23.891
then in that light you can easily see

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.724
how your mind works,

00:11:27.225 --> 00:11:29.308
what ideas it gives,

00:11:29.683 --> 00:11:36.225
what affects your mind

00:11:36.933 --> 00:11:38.891
while you’re ascending.

00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:41.141
Is this the worry

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:46.933
or is this the responsibility that you have?

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:51.558
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

00:11:51.974 --> 00:11:53.724
that there is an impediment

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.225
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

00:11:59.933 --> 00:12:02.682
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:08.058
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

00:12:09.558 --> 00:12:12.558
It’s a very beautiful journey

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:14.642
– very, very beautiful journey.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.308
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

00:12:17.682 --> 00:12:22.308
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:28.558
the journey of kundalini.

00:12:30.642 --> 00:12:38.266
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

00:12:39.933 --> 00:12:44.642
Basically you were not a realized soul,

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:47.891
but now you are a realized soul.

00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.266
You are a evolved state.

00:12:50.724 --> 00:12:56.475
Now what is missing is the idea

00:12:56.933 --> 00:13:01.891
that we are absolutely all right

00:13:02.392 --> 00:13:06.683
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.724
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.891
it’s not going to help you at all.

00:13:16.392 --> 00:13:19.392
What you have to do is to

00:13:20.183 --> 00:13:22.016
all the time introspect yourself.

00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:24.600
That’s what is meditation for,

00:13:24.974 --> 00:13:26.517
to see for yourself

00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:30.974
how you are keeping up

00:13:31.475 --> 00:13:34.642
your spiritual ascent.

00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.558
No one else can do it,

00:13:36.974 --> 00:13:39.392
it’s your own individual work.

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:41.642
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:44.683
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:48.808
They may not say, they may not refer it,

00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:50.682
but they will know definitely

00:13:51.058 --> 00:13:52.808
that such-and-such chakra is catching

00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:55.141
and this person has this problem.

00:13:55.558 --> 00:14:00.266
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:04.766
what is their problem is.

00:14:05.308 --> 00:14:07.225
So if somebody tells you

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.475
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:12.475
you should never, never feel bad about it,

00:14:12.808 --> 00:14:15.517
because by keeping that chakra intact

00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:18.724
you are ruining your own life.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.682
So what you have to do is to see

00:14:22.058 --> 00:14:23.808
that if somebody tells you that

00:14:24.183 --> 00:14:28.100
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

00:14:28.475 --> 00:14:31.058
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:34.058
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:36.600
there’s something wrong with your face,

00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:38.308
you can immediately correct it.

00:14:38.682 --> 00:14:42.308
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:46.100
you have to be mature enough that you should know

00:14:46.433 --> 00:14:48.100
that it is a great blessing

00:14:48.517 --> 00:14:51.600
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.266
Like the other day there was some quarrel

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.016
between the two leaders.

00:14:56.392 --> 00:14:58.849
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:00.433
There should not be.

00:15:00.642 --> 00:15:04.225
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.891
two legs do not fight.

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:09.183
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.724
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

00:15:14.517 --> 00:15:17.308
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:22.266
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

00:15:22.766 --> 00:15:26.308
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

00:15:26.766 --> 00:15:28.974
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

00:15:29.392 --> 00:15:30.974
When he puts his hand towards Me,

00:15:31.392 --> 00:15:34.266
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.808
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

00:15:37.183 --> 00:15:41.016
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

00:15:41.392 --> 00:15:43.517
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:47.558
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

00:15:48.392 --> 00:15:53.642
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

00:15:54.016 --> 00:15:56.558
because I said it to him.

00:15:57.183 --> 00:16:00.141
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

00:16:00.642 --> 00:16:02.475
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:03.933
what is good for him.

00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:05.683
He did not feel bad at all.

00:16:06.058 --> 00:16:08.183
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:11.350
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

00:16:11.724 --> 00:16:16.100
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.683
Now, the problem with us is that

00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:31.308
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:34.808
and we have consolidated it.

00:16:35.308 --> 00:16:37.308
Also, we have a great collective force,

00:16:37.683 --> 00:16:40.183
I can see, in every country.

00:16:40.642 --> 00:16:43.350
We can give realizations to so many,

00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:46.350
and we can really establish

00:16:46.766 --> 00:16:51.475
all these great truths in our lives.

00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:53.308
We can do it.

00:16:53.642 --> 00:16:57.183
All the time we should establish them.

00:16:57.974 --> 00:17:01.350
But there is one point

00:17:01.724 --> 00:17:04.808
on which one should not be very sure:

00:17:05.266 --> 00:17:11.433
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:15.100
You have to be careful on this point very much.

00:17:15.517 --> 00:17:21.308
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:26.392
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

00:17:27.475 --> 00:17:30.808
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.600
The reason is that they have no faith

00:17:34.974 --> 00:17:41.558
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:45.642
This is the faith which is missing.

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:50.849
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:55.808
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

00:17:57.558 --> 00:18:04.141
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

00:18:07.058 --> 00:18:11.849
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:13.974
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

00:18:14.308 --> 00:18:16.392
– you have known that it is so.

00:18:16.724 --> 00:18:18.392
But even knowing that,

00:18:18.724 --> 00:18:22.225
it has not become such a faith within you.

00:18:22.683 --> 00:18:26.475
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

00:18:26.891 --> 00:18:29.350
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

00:18:29.682 --> 00:18:31.183
not the blind faith.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.016
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:39.558
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

00:18:39.849 --> 00:18:44.808
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:47.433
There cannot be any problems

00:18:47.808 --> 00:18:51.266
if your faith is enlightened.

00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:54.933
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.766
many people who are very steady,

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:03.683
who are upright,

00:19:04.308 --> 00:19:06.558
who are very valuable.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.891
They are like the people

00:19:09.266 --> 00:19:12.433
who know they are standing on the rocks.

00:19:12.974 --> 00:19:17.016
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

00:19:17.308 --> 00:19:20.433
they think they are still dwindling

00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:26.517
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

00:19:28.642 --> 00:19:32.724
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

00:19:33.183 --> 00:19:37.350
and also that has come out of faith

00:19:37.683 --> 00:19:40.849
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:43.849
nothing can trouble us.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.683
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.766
I mean, He knew everything,

00:19:50.141 --> 00:19:52.183
so He was sure about it.

00:19:52.682 --> 00:19:56.350
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

00:19:56.849 --> 00:20:00.392
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:03.433
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:06.600
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:08.849
It is so.

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:13.517
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

00:20:13.974 --> 00:20:17.350
while the other people,

00:20:20.058 --> 00:20:21.974
even Sahaja yogis,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.642
have to become like Christ

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.891
as far as the faith is concerned.

00:20:29.475 --> 00:20:33.849
This faith is to be understood.

00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:37.475
This is an enlightened faith.

00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:42.183
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.058
He went into all kinds of things,

00:20:45.517 --> 00:20:49.475
just because He knew it was just a drama

00:20:49.808 --> 00:20:54.100
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

00:20:54.558 --> 00:20:57.849
and there’s nothing serious,

00:20:58.808 --> 00:21:00.016
nothing is going to matter,

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.849
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

00:21:02.225 --> 00:21:04.475
He played the drama.

00:21:04.974 --> 00:21:08.433
To Him it was nothing very serious.

00:21:10.849 --> 00:21:14.682
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:19.433
He also in His heart knew everything that

00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:23.808
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:28.682
But at the same time,

00:21:29.683 --> 00:21:32.600
He was the embodiment of faith:

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.600
faith in Himself

00:21:37.933 --> 00:21:41.682
and in this all-pervading Power.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.392
This never lets you down,

00:21:45.849 --> 00:21:50.766
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

00:21:51.475 --> 00:21:56.225
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

00:21:57.475 --> 00:22:01.558
naturally I will give him all the work,

00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:04.475
I will trust everything,

00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:07.808
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

00:22:08.141 --> 00:22:11.433
never doubt such a person.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.849
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

00:22:18.517 --> 00:22:25.308
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.225
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:33.808
how life will improve

00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:39.392
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:42.225
You’ll have no doubts,

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.350
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

00:22:49.974 --> 00:22:54.141
So, this is such a state

00:22:54.682 --> 00:22:56.392
– only with faith.

00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:59.642
But now this faith, how do you get?

00:23:00.058 --> 00:23:04.225
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.016
There’s no course about it,

00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:08.225
there’s no literature about it,

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.849
there’s no lecture about it.

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:16.724
But there is an awakening within you

00:23:17.183 --> 00:23:21.225
which will ask this

00:23:21.808 --> 00:23:24.266
“What am I?” – this awakening,

00:23:24.642 --> 00:23:27.058
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:32.891
You see, this will question

00:23:34.974 --> 00:23:38.766
“What is it that I have achieved?

00:23:39.183 --> 00:23:42.433
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

00:23:42.891 --> 00:23:45.475
All these questions will come to you.

00:23:45.974 --> 00:23:48.016
But if you have faith,

00:23:48.475 --> 00:23:50.849
not the blind but the enlightened

00:23:51.308 --> 00:23:53.808
which is established by many miracles in life,

00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:55.308
many things in life;

00:23:55.682 --> 00:23:58.475
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

00:23:58.808 --> 00:24:00.016
small, small things.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.433
There have been miracles even in big things,

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:06.558
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

00:24:06.974 --> 00:24:08.600
So now you know, very well settled,

00:24:09.016 --> 00:24:12.517
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:15.600
For example, it starts raining.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.183
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.225
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.808
nothing can happen.

00:24:24.183 --> 00:24:26.350
Let it rain as much as it likes.

00:24:26.724 --> 00:24:30.475
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:32.558
it’s not going to drench us.

00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:38.058
In the same way this faith within us

00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:42.141
has to be absolutely solid,

00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:46.808
and that makes you extremely strong

00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:49.683
and makes you responsible

00:24:50.058 --> 00:24:52.308
for the resurrection of thousands

00:24:52.642 --> 00:24:57.100
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

00:25:02.517 --> 00:25:06.517
This kind of life that we have

00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:13.600
– that only by our own establishment,

00:25:14.058 --> 00:25:17.683
by our own understanding,

00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:23.724
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:27.308
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

00:25:28.517 --> 00:25:31.891
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

00:25:32.308 --> 00:25:36.475
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:41.100
You all should have the chance

00:25:41.682 --> 00:25:45.266
to know your spirit

00:25:45.724 --> 00:25:49.891
and to know yourself.

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:53.350
So one has to have faith in oneself.

00:25:53.808 --> 00:25:56.016
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

00:25:56.433 --> 00:25:59.392
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:03.766
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

00:26:07.016 --> 00:26:10.849
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

00:26:11.724 --> 00:26:14.475
What do you want?

00:26:14.891 --> 00:26:19.141
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.100
even if you don’t ask.

00:26:23.558 --> 00:26:29.058
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

00:26:29.642 --> 00:26:32.974
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:36.016
because this all-pervading Power

00:26:36.558 --> 00:26:38.141
is the only real power,

00:26:38.517 --> 00:26:41.433
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

00:26:42.266 --> 00:26:49.016
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

00:26:49.683 --> 00:26:56.766
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:01.433
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:03.517
and he was deceived by someone

00:27:03.933 --> 00:27:06.350
and made him buy a land and a house

00:27:06.766 --> 00:27:10.682
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

00:27:11.141 --> 00:27:12.058
And this fellow said,

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.891
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:15.974
they will not say anything to you.”

00:27:16.308 --> 00:27:18.682
He believed him – had wrong faith,

00:27:18.974 --> 00:27:22.683
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:28.558
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:35.517
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

00:27:38.308 --> 00:27:42.016
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

00:27:42.433 --> 00:27:45.350
and so many people came and saw all this.

00:27:45.766 --> 00:27:49.891
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

00:27:50.308 --> 00:27:51.558
he could not understand,

00:27:51.974 --> 00:27:53.558
“Why it has happened to me

00:27:53.974 --> 00:27:57.933
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

00:27:59.724 --> 00:28:01.600
And he was deceived and he was,

00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:04.600
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:08.766
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

00:28:09.308 --> 00:28:12.600
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

00:28:12.974 --> 00:28:19.183
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:25.225
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

00:28:25.642 --> 00:28:28.724
That’s all – “Have faith.”

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.433
And what a miraculous thing happened,

00:28:31.808 --> 00:28:36.558
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

00:28:39.682 --> 00:28:41.517
And that fellow said,

00:28:41.974 --> 00:28:44.933
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

00:28:45.392 --> 00:28:48.350
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:52.600
that I want to pay.”

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:58.891
It’s something unbelievable.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.517
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:09.100
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

00:29:09.392 --> 00:29:12.225
Nothing worked out, nothing

00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:14.724
– only his faith.

00:29:15.183 --> 00:29:18.849
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

00:29:19.517 --> 00:29:20.808
He was supposed to go to jail,

00:29:21.183 --> 00:29:22.475
now he’s going to become a rich man.

00:29:22.849 --> 00:29:25.266
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

00:29:25.766 --> 00:29:27.266
This is just the financial side of it,

00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:28.475
but I know you know

00:29:28.808 --> 00:29:30.724
that there are so many other miracles happening.

00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:35.350
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

00:29:35.766 --> 00:29:39.183
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

00:29:39.682 --> 00:29:43.266
After realization at least you should take to faith.

00:29:43.933 --> 00:29:46.600
That really is something surprising

00:29:46.933 --> 00:29:49.016
that people get their realization and everything,

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:53.766
still they do not have faith in themselves.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:59.600
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

00:30:00.392 --> 00:30:04.974
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.016
faith was part and parcel of His being.

00:30:08.517 --> 00:30:13.225
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

00:30:13.891 --> 00:30:16.808
Now we have to have it.

00:30:17.392 --> 00:30:21.058
We have to believe in ourselves.

00:30:21.724 --> 00:30:23.766
There’s so many incidents I can give you

00:30:24.308 --> 00:30:26.642
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:31.058
where just the faith has helped.

00:30:32.308 --> 00:30:34.808
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

00:30:35.308 --> 00:30:37.475
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:40.058
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:44.225
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

00:30:44.517 --> 00:30:46.682
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

00:30:46.974 --> 00:30:48.308
She said it three times.

00:30:48.682 --> 00:30:50.642
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:53.266
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.350
She just got up, walked out.

00:30:55.724 --> 00:30:58.225
And then she started running all the way,

00:30:58.642 --> 00:31:00.600
and everybody started laughing.

00:31:00.933 --> 00:31:02.642
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

00:31:03.016 --> 00:31:05.266
I said, “But see her faith!”

00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:11.808
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

00:31:12.766 --> 00:31:19.141
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

00:31:20.308 --> 00:31:22.849
They have shown faith in that person.

00:31:23.225 --> 00:31:24.683
As I have told you always,

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:28.016
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:30.100
One among hundred might deceive us

00:31:30.392 --> 00:31:31.891
doesn’t matter, we trust.

00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:36.016
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:38.225
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

00:31:38.682 --> 00:31:41.517
But what about deities?

00:31:41.974 --> 00:31:44.849
You show faith in them and it works,

00:31:45.266 --> 00:31:46.600
immediately they work out.

00:31:47.016 --> 00:31:48.266
Like Guido told Me that

00:31:48.642 --> 00:31:51.392
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

00:31:51.891 --> 00:31:53.558
for these two days.”

00:31:53.974 --> 00:31:58.058
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

00:31:59.308 --> 00:32:02.141
It disappeared.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:08.141
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

00:32:10.766 --> 00:32:14.974
And when we talk of faith, you know,

00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:21.266
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

00:32:22.392 --> 00:32:27.100
which organizes, which knows everything,

00:32:27.642 --> 00:32:29.724
which is so intelligent, efficient

00:32:30.141 --> 00:32:31.682
– above all, it loves you.

00:32:32.058 --> 00:32:35.141
And then you show faith.

00:32:36.683 --> 00:32:43.808
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

00:32:45.058 --> 00:32:49.766
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:51.683
They don’t feel then bad,

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.808
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

00:32:55.183 --> 00:32:57.683
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

00:32:58.058 --> 00:33:01.141
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

00:33:01.558 --> 00:33:04.058
whether this thing happens or not.

00:33:04.558 --> 00:33:08.475
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

00:33:08.933 --> 00:33:10.141
Supposing you are lost on the way,

00:33:10.517 --> 00:33:13.808
know that it has to be that way.

00:33:14.642 --> 00:33:18.350
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

00:33:18.724 --> 00:33:20.266
He was to be crucified.

00:33:20.682 --> 00:33:22.100
He had to carry the cross,

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:26.058
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

00:33:26.558 --> 00:33:28.475
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

00:33:28.808 --> 00:33:31.350
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

00:33:31.766 --> 00:33:35.724
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

00:33:36.266 --> 00:33:39.266
But this faith in Him gave Him

00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:44.766
such a tremendous powers.

00:33:46.183 --> 00:33:47.891
He could have done anything.

00:33:48.308 --> 00:33:50.392
He could have killed all these people

00:33:50.683 --> 00:33:54.308
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

00:33:54.682 --> 00:33:56.642
Just one glance could have killed them.

00:33:57.058 --> 00:34:00.100
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

00:34:00.433 --> 00:34:01.642
He went through it.

00:34:01.974 --> 00:34:05.475
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

00:34:05.849 --> 00:34:08.683
He is the one who won everything.

00:34:09.392 --> 00:34:11.225
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.433
has to look at one’s own life.

00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:20.225
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:25.266
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

00:34:25.766 --> 00:34:27.682
In the evolutionary process

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.642
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

00:34:32.225 --> 00:34:38.475
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

00:34:38.974 --> 00:34:41.517
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:44.683
most of the people are not going to be there.

00:34:45.141 --> 00:34:46.600
Not that we are not available,

00:34:47.016 --> 00:34:52.682
but because they are not fated

00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:54.933
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:55.266 --> 00:34:57.558
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:57.933 --> 00:34:59.475
So, you are so fortunate

00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:03.724
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.100
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

00:35:07.517 --> 00:35:11.933
in your resurrection that is your being now.

00:35:12.433 --> 00:35:15.475
And with that you will know how precious

00:35:15.849 --> 00:35:18.642
you are for the whole world,

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:21.141
and that what you have to do is not

00:35:21.475 --> 00:35:24.225
to think of material gains, physical gains

00:35:24.682 --> 00:35:29.933
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

00:35:30.808 --> 00:35:35.350
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

00:35:35.849 --> 00:35:37.891
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:40.517
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:41.974
everything works out,

00:35:42.475 --> 00:35:46.141
everything in its own time shows its own results.

00:35:48.308 --> 00:35:52.100
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:57.642
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

00:36:00.683 --> 00:36:06.600
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

00:36:06.933 --> 00:36:08.433
“All right, Mother says so.

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:11.974
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

00:36:12.558 --> 00:36:14.225
Like the other day I had a journalist,

00:36:14.683 --> 00:36:17.642
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

00:36:18.016 --> 00:36:19.016
I said, “Why?”

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:23.683
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.058
How can there be a blind child,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.849
how can this and how can that?”

00:36:29.308 --> 00:36:31.766
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

00:36:32.058 --> 00:36:33.891
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

00:36:34.308 --> 00:36:37.600
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:42.891
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

00:36:43.266 --> 00:36:47.766
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

00:36:49.266 --> 00:36:52.600
So the situation is explainable;

00:36:53.016 --> 00:36:57.475
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

00:36:58.183 --> 00:37:01.933
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.225
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

00:37:04.683 --> 00:37:08.642
have you any problems? None.”

00:37:11.475 --> 00:37:13.683
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.891
Now if you say that there is a way out

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:21.350
and that there is a solution,

00:37:21.766 --> 00:37:24.808
and that a time can come

00:37:25.141 --> 00:37:28.058
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

00:37:28.475 --> 00:37:31.849
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

00:37:33.682 --> 00:37:35.350
so why not see this?

00:37:35.724 --> 00:37:39.433
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

00:37:40.724 --> 00:37:44.682
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.517
So this kind of negative attitude

00:37:48.891 --> 00:37:51.016
also Sahaja yogis can have.

00:37:51.475 --> 00:37:53.724
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

00:37:54.183 --> 00:37:56.682
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

00:37:56.974 --> 00:38:00.225
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

00:38:00.766 --> 00:38:05.225
You can cure, your faith can cure.

00:38:05.724 --> 00:38:08.558
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

00:38:08.933 --> 00:38:10.183
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

00:38:10.682 --> 00:38:14.308
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

00:38:14.682 --> 00:38:16.933
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

00:38:17.433 --> 00:38:21.849
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:25.058
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

00:38:25.517 --> 00:38:28.266
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.766
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

00:38:31.183 --> 00:38:32.642
Third day he was out of hospital,

00:38:32.891 --> 00:38:35.100
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

00:38:35.517 --> 00:38:39.100
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.724
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.392
the deities have to work it out.

00:38:44.849 --> 00:38:48.016
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

00:38:48.558 --> 00:38:51.392
It’s the deities who stood by it.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:39:01.808
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:08.600
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.849
Why not we develop that complete faith

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.225
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

00:39:15.642 --> 00:39:18.600
we are in the Kingdom of God,

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.350
and that this Power is going to look after us?

00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:26.475
Then we’ll have no choices,

00:39:26.933 --> 00:39:32.808
we’ll have no hesitation.

00:39:33.683 --> 00:39:37.225
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

00:39:37.642 --> 00:39:40.100
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

00:39:40.517 --> 00:39:42.682
or go anywhere – so what?

00:39:43.141 --> 00:39:46.350
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

00:39:46.724 --> 00:39:49.350
it’s perfectly all right.

00:39:49.891 --> 00:39:52.266
And no worry of any kind.

00:39:52.683 --> 00:39:55.225
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

00:39:55.558 --> 00:39:57.974
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.100
Everything drops out.

00:40:00.517 --> 00:40:01.808
Doesn’t matter.

00:40:02.225 --> 00:40:05.100
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

00:40:05.558 --> 00:40:09.350
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

00:40:09.808 --> 00:40:10.766
Like people tell Me,

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.475
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

00:40:12.808 --> 00:40:15.600
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:18.433
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

00:40:18.891 --> 00:40:20.016
only the seat is changed.

00:40:20.433 --> 00:40:22.683
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

00:40:23.058 --> 00:40:27.808
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

00:40:29.266 --> 00:40:35.392
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:38.475
then you don’t bother.

00:40:38.933 --> 00:40:41.392
Many people will find out whether

00:40:41.724 --> 00:40:44.141
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:49.058
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

00:40:51.558 --> 00:40:53.974
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

00:40:54.392 --> 00:40:58.016
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

00:40:58.517 --> 00:41:01.392
Nothing can bind you,

00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:03.600
nothing can pull you down,

00:41:03.933 --> 00:41:07.766
no habit can come back on you;

00:41:09.766 --> 00:41:15.058
because faith will purify you completely,

00:41:15.642 --> 00:41:18.683
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

00:41:19.183 --> 00:41:22.974
This faith is not something

00:41:23.433 --> 00:41:25.058
that can be put into your heads

00:41:25.475 --> 00:41:29.058
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

00:41:29.766 --> 00:41:34.600
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

00:41:35.308 --> 00:41:40.308
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:45.517
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

00:41:46.642 --> 00:41:48.642
would be established,

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:50.808
would be effective,

00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:56.600
and for the whole world will be a model.

00:41:58.183 --> 00:42:01.766
May God bless you all.

00:42:34.558 --> 00:42:39.058
There are just the children, there are so many children.

00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:43.642
Today is the day of Christ,

00:42:43.933 --> 00:42:48.100
so we should have children in any case to wash My feet.

00:42:49.891 --> 00:42:54.392
Can you fit it there, or you will have to move it?
