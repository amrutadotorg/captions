1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,260
So "Sahaja Yoga" means
spontaneous union with the Divine.

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,780
"Saha" is with, "ja" is born,

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,780
that is spontaneous, born with you: everybody
has a right to get this union with the Divine.

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,040
The another meaning of the word "Divine" is that

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:38,100
the power of God that is all-pervading, which
does all the living work – like transformation

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,460
of flower into fruit, different seasons –
all that is living is done by this power.

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,520
And this Divine, you have to become one.

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,369
You have to feel it on your fingertips.

9
00:00:51,369 --> 00:01:01,440
This yoga also means the deftness, means also
the complete knowledge about this divine power,

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,420
how to handle it, how to work
it out and how to use it.

11
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,656
By awakening of this kundalini, as a
by-product you get your physical health.

12
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:18,000
I've said many a times that cancer cannot be cured
by anything else but by the kundalini awakening.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,460
Yesterday I explained to you how cancer is
caused, and how kundalini clears it out.

14
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,280
Most of your diseases come because the
centers are out of gear, they have broken

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,280
their relationship with the whole, or maybe
that there's something lacking in the centers.

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,680
When the kundalini rises she only
nourishes them so well that with that

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,436
nourishment all these center, your mental,
physical, emotional centers get completely

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,400
satisfied and fulfilled, and they become healthy.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,300
With that you get good health, good
mind and good balanced emotional life.

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,160
But last of all, when she crosses this limit,

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,100
this is the place
where resides the God Almighty.

22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,380
Now, I'm saying again that
you are not to believe Me,

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,660
because people don't believe
in God also these days.

24
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,300
So I say that this is the place of
God Almighty on top of your head,

25
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,760
but He is reflected in your heart as Spirit;
and as soon as the kundalini touches that seat,

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,640
the hands start flowing with
cool breeze in the hand.

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,680
First you feel the cool breeze of your
own kundalini coming up and then the

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,560
grace starts flowing through you, and you feel
the grace in your hand as cool breeze flowing.

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,820
So it happens.

30
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,300
Once it happens you have to
establish yourself a little bit,

31
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,780
you have to understand it, what it
is and how to keep it established.

32
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
It takes at the most for some people only
one day but some people a month or so,

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,697
and then you become the master.

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,080
You become a different personality, you
become so powerful and so compassionate;

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,740
very compassionate and very
powerful like Christ, you see.

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,920
When people were trying to throw stones
at Mary Magdalene – she was a prostitute,

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,300
and He stood against it.

38
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,780
He had nothing to do with prostitutes as such,
but He stood against all the people and He said,

39
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,140
"Now those who have not committed any sin can
throw the stones at Me." And nobody would do it,

40
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,680
because He's such a powerful,
compassionate person.

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,600
And that's what it is, you become
a person identified with truth.

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,060
You are not afraid of anyone, you always tell
the truth and will tell with great power.

43
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,660
Like you had a great poet like William Blake, who
has said about these modern times that at this

44
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:59,280
time the men of God – means the people who are
seeking God or who are believing in God – will

45
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,960
become prophets and they'll have
power to make others prophet.

46
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,180
This is exactly what Sahaja Yoga does,

47
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,620
that you get your realization and you
start giving realization to another.

48
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,360
Like an enlightened light can enlighten
another light which is not enlightened,

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,840
and then that enlightened light
can enlighten many other lights.

50
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,100
Is simple as that.

51
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,040
There's nothing to take or
give, it's just a catalyst,

52
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,380
that you enlighten another light and
that person enlightens another light.

53
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,440
So there is no obligation, there's nothing give

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,400
and take, but it's just a simple
happening that you can understand.

55
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,900
This Dr. Warren himself has given
realization to thousands of people.

56
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,100
Even in Madras I could not go, I sent him and
he gave realization to three hundred people.

57
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,360
Like in India we have somebody who has
given realization to ten thousand people.

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
It's a fact.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
And you can verify it.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,020
When you yourself get your realization
you'll be surprised that you can give

61
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,600
realization to people and you can cure them.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,120
You can give them peace and bliss of God.

63
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,440
Then at that time you become
collectively conscious;

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,780
you become part and parcel of the whole.

65
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,240
Like many people had the catch yesterday on the
Vishuddhi Chakra – because of certain reasons,

66
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,040
some troubles, some had spondylitis, some had
something – and they couldn't cross this thing.

67
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,740
Only they had to say three times, "Mother,

68
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,820
I am the part and parcel of the whole,"
and they started feeling the cool breeze.

69
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,620
It's so simple as that.

70
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,860
And they started feeling the cool breeze,
because they were obstructed here.

71
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,220
So it's very simple methods which even a child
can do, which you can do is there, and I hope

72
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,880
today in this place which is so beautiful,
Bath, we will all receive this realization.

73
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,659
May God bless you all.
