00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:22.600
Today we have assembled here to celebrate the Sahasrara Day

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:30.727
which was opened in 1970 on this date.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:45.400
I find this beautiful canopy is like our Sahasrara,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.080
and so very apt

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.840
to have this beautiful arrangement for Sahasrara Day.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.240
We have to understand what happens when the Sahasrara opens.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:19.680
When the Kundalini passes through the five centers,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.940
it enters into the area which we call as limbic area.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.780
This area is all surrounded by thousand nerves.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.040
And when these nerves get enlightened,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.680
they look like flames of vibgyor colors, seven colors,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:59.680
and very mildly, beautifully shining, emitting peace.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:12.280
But when the Kundalini starts emitting its vibration

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.760
on the sides,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.200
all these nerves get enlightened gradually

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:43.120
and start moving on all directions, opening the Sahasrara.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.600
And then the Kundalini

00:02:54.999 --> 00:03:08.560
emerges out through the fontanel bone area

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.899
which we call as Brahmarandhra.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.880
Randhra means "the hole"

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.640
and the Brahma is the all-pervading Power of God's love.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:35.440
So it enters into the subtle energy which is all-pervading

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.280
which we do not feel normally.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.540
But then the Chaitanya, the vibrations

00:03:48.640 --> 00:04:00.980
which are the part and parcel of this energy, all-pervading Power,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.840
the Paramachaitanya,

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:14.520
they start entering into our brain;

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:24.120
and showering their blessings, in the limbic area they assemble.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.899
Now the limbic area is connected to all the area of the brain

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:38.840
and also to the nerves.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.540
So it starts flowing onto the nerves,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.599
giving you the new awareness of collective consciousness

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.780
called as samuhik chetana.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.640
So you get a new chetana, a new awareness

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:11.760
which is showered upon your limbic area.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:21.720
The working of these Chaitanya waves is very interesting.

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:31.800
They are normally formed like small commas,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.960
but then they go into different forms.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.400
They make themselves into swastikas,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.358
as the four-limbed symbol of innocence.

00:05:53.264 --> 00:06:01.480
Or they become the Aumkara, as you know how Aum is written,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:13.520
which is the symbol of our doing, our awareness.

00:06:14.247 --> 00:06:27.270
So when they form the swastika they try to nourish the left side,

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:32.098
and when they form the Aumkara they nourish the right side.

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:36.943
Left and right sympathetic nervous system they nourish.

00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:47.359
But Sahasrara is to be kept open

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.720
it's rather difficult for people

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.840
because it's a vicious circle.

00:06:54.999 --> 00:07:00.320
First these vibrations should enter into your brain

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.440
through the Brahmarandhra when it is opened out,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.189
and they should nourish your nerves

00:07:10.376 --> 00:07:16.329
by which your left and right side open out;

00:07:16.532 --> 00:07:24.780
and so more Chaitanya can flow down all these centers.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:32.899
But if your Sahasrara is not properly opened,

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:37.580
this process doesn't take place.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.899
As a result of that, the chakras don't open,

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:57.999
the Kundalini only as very few strands is kept in the spinal cord,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:09.600
and the new strands cannot rise because your chakras are not open.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:18.360
So in Sahaja Yoga it is very important to keep your Sahasrara open,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.880
otherwise there's a vicious circle.

00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:28.500
To keep the Sahasrara open is in a way very easy,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.080
as well as difficult.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.430
As you have known in the Devi Mahatmyam

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:42.877
that at Sahasrara, Mahamaya comes.

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:48.160
She is a Mahamaya: not easy to recognize Her,

00:08:48.415 --> 00:08:51.040
not easy to know Her.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.999
She lives just like you,

00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.320
She moves just like you,

00:08:57.527 --> 00:09:04.687
and you can never make out Her real nature.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.880
She is in the form of Mahamaya.

00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:20.280
So at the Sahasrara, to recognize the Mahamaya is another vicious circle.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.100
You may say that why should it be Mahamaya?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.580
should have been better as starkingly some other form.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.540
But any other form could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.720
in modern times;

00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:43.000
because people would have been frightened and upset

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.320
and they would never have taken to Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.999
because they had no discretion already

00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:52.580
within them to know what is right, what is wrong.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.306
That is why it had to be in the Mahamaya form.

00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:04.980
In the Mahamaya form you have to recognize.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.805
This is another test because Mahamaya you cannot recognize,

00:10:09.905 --> 00:10:13.666
while you have to recognize.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.360
But in Sahaja Yoga you have seen so many photographs

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.000
which should convince you people mentally

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.040
about this Mahamaya swarupa.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.999
You can see mentally, you can understand there's something very different.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.720
Even when I came to Napoli,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.899
the policeman and everybody was given a photograph

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:46.060
and they all recognized that there is something very different,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.160
they all wanted to shake hands with Me.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.200
This is one way.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.400
Another way is that you start seeing the blessings,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.258
and you start seeing how you become so progressively

00:11:04.358 --> 00:11:09.757
better materially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.440
Still on a mental level most of the people recognize.

00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:27.920
But unless and until it is recognized in the heart,

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:33.360
it's no recognition.

00:11:34.437 --> 00:11:48.557
Already the heart is surrounded by seven auras of the seven chakras.

00:11:50.714 --> 00:11:55.874
And the spirit, the Atma, resides in the heart.

00:11:58.084 --> 00:12:02.340
As it is, on top of your head here

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.680
resides the God Almighty, Sadashiva.

00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:12.928
So when Kundalini touches that point

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:16.500
your spirit gets awakened

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.999
and the light of the spirit starts spreading,

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:29.899
and it starts acting on your central nervous system;

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:35.400
because automatically the vibrations,

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:40.670
the Chaitanya flow into your brain

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.010
who enlighten your nerves.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:56.480
But still the recognition on the heart is not there.

00:12:56.869 --> 00:13:02.229
Even without that you start feeling the cool breeze,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.726
you can raise the kundalini of others

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:09.066
you can cure people,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.455
you can do many things,

00:13:12.555 --> 00:13:20.115
but still it is not yet felt in the heart so much.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.800
That's why we have music, art

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:38.040
all these things start opening your heart.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.220
But still it is not recognition,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.440
because recognition is a mental activity of the heart.

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:51.240
How can heart have a mental activity?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.899
This is another problem you all can face, and I know that

00:13:57.999 --> 00:14:03.342
that recognition, if it is a mental activity of the heart,

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.242
how do we do it?

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:12.660
Say, if you are a Christian born in a Christian family,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.180
as soon as you see the photograph of Christ,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.260
immediately you feel it is Christ, you see - something here.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.220
Or if you are a Hindu, if you see the photograph of Shri Rama,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.999
immediately you know it's Shri Ram, you see - there's a kind of a thing,

00:14:28.109 --> 00:14:32.270
recognition in the heart.

00:14:34.366 --> 00:14:39.260
But the recognition of somebody living with you

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.999
is very, very difficult,

00:14:42.204 --> 00:14:50.360
and you live on the cusp of your mental activities only.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.240
But to go deep down into your heart,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.520
"What should we do?" people tell Me.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.160
"Mother, how should we get into our heart?

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:14.304
How this mental activity can be performed through the heart?"

00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:21.520
Now you must remember that heart is absolutely connected with brain,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.200
absolutely connected.

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:33.409
It's not disconnected thing if it was, it would not have worked out.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:41.360
When heart fails, after some time brain also fails;

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.280
the whole body goes out of order.

00:16:30.142 --> 00:16:41.262
So this mental activity of the heart is to be understood this way,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.920
that as soon as you see the danger,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.020
without even thinking, in a reflex way

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.280
your heart starts pumping more blood and you get palpitation.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.220
You don't have to think, there's no mental activity;

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.160
just you see supposing a tiger standing before you,

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.327
immediately the heart will start pumping.

00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:15.787
It's a reflex action.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.500
Now how this activity takes place, one may say,

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.060
is that because it is built in within you

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.660
that as soon as you see some emergency

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.080
your sympathetic nervous system goes into activity,

00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:38.875
and you start feeling the fear,

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:44.340
you start feeling that there should be some protection,

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.340
that you should do something about it.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.060
But you do not think, you just run,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.899
you run as fast as possible.

00:17:53.999 --> 00:17:55.300
You don't think about it

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.260
"what I should do, where I should run?"

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:04.500
just you go on running away from the danger.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.700
And how do you do that?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.980
Because it is built in within you, all this, in your brain

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:19.420
that as soon as the heart starts pumping too much blood,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:26.194
it should just make the legs work and the hands work and you should run.

00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:31.499
Or we can say it is in the central nervous system built in,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.080
the fear.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.478
Any reaction, any response like that is built in within you.

00:18:43.478 --> 00:18:51.560
But the response to the spirituality is not yet manifested.

00:18:52.999 --> 00:19:00.800
It is manifested. It is all built, no doubt,

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.999
but it is not yet manifested.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.840
And how will it manifest?

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.160
That's what people ask Me, "Mother, how will it manifest?"

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:23.840
Through your past

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:26.420
you have learnt that you have to be afraid of this,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.728
you have to be afraid of that.

00:19:28.881 --> 00:19:31.881
Also in this lifetime you have learnt many things.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.938
For a child may put his hand to the candle, won't feel, be frightened;

00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:40.088
but a grown-up would, because of an experience.

00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:44.600
With the experience gradually you built in

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:51.480
that reaction of reflex within you, so that you'll try to save yourself.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.600
Now what experience you should have

00:19:58.786 --> 00:20:04.026
to build that in your heart, is the point.

00:20:05.415 --> 00:20:13.135
And the experience is of your own divinity,

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:20.560
of your own spirituality.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:31.035
Once you start developing that experience,

00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:35.899
then you know that you are a divine person.

00:20:35.999 --> 00:20:44.280
Unless and until you are aware fully that you are a divine person,

00:20:44.502 --> 00:20:51.340
howsoever faith you may have in Me, the recognition is not complete

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.446
because who is recognizing Me is a blind person.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.020
If a blind person is recognizing Me,

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.899
it won't have that response of the heart.

00:21:03.999 --> 00:21:09.200
So first you have to recognize yourself to be a divine person,

00:21:09.356 --> 00:21:12.996
to have faith in yourself.
