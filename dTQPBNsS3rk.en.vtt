00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.060
Today is a very

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.900
joyous that all of us are here in Turkey,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.060
to celebrate the Puja of Fatima.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.020
As you know about Her that She was the daughter

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.340
of Mohammed Sahib and was married to Ali,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.300
and She had two children, Hassan and Hussein,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.060
who were ultimately killed in Karbala

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.740
by the fanatics,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.940
who were that time called themselves Sunnis.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.100
All this happened because there were fanaticism,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.660
and the fanaticism

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.860
that makes person thinks always

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.380
that they are on the right

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.380
and they have every right to be

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.020
angry, to persuade, to convince another party,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.900
another person.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.660
And these fanaticisms grew

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.900
since long – it’s not a new thing.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.100
It is so obvious now that our main problem

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.140
in this world is of fanaticism.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.340
Fatima lost Her two children,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.420
and She was the embodiment of

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.820
Gruha Lakshmi.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.940
She resides in our Left Nabhi.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.020
So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.460
all the problems that are connected with your Left Nabhi

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.100
can be only corrected by Fatima.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.260
So you have to keep Fatima awakened within yourself.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.060
That we are here in the Islamic culture,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.940
we can say, this is place of Islamic culture;

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.380
and in the Islamic culture a housewife was given

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.780
a very, very important place.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.660
At the time of Mohammed Sahib

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.780
there were struggles and fights

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.420
and wars going on between different tribes.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.380
As a result many, many

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.380
young men were killed.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.140
Only quite old people survived,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.700
and also so many women.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.580
This is the reason why Mohammed said that

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.820
“You can marry four wives, five wives;

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.820
but you cannot allow them to remain

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:54.500
unmarried or they will have extramarital relationships.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.060
That will be the greatest fall for Islam,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.420
for that religion.”

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.460
So He understood that unless and until

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.660
women are kept absolutely chaste,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.660
absolutely pure,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.620
there cannot be the Kingdom of God.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.380
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.100
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.020
meaning “Where the women are respected,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.500
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.740
not that they are to be worshipped,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.780
but they are respectable –

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:44.180
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.860
So, so much responsibility is on women.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.060
So from Fatima’s life we have to know that

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.100
She did not go out of Her house

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.780
and She remained a housewife,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.420
and She made Her two children grow up

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.740
in such a manner that they had to fight the war

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.380
against fanaticism.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.460
Her husband also was there.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.620
This is how a woman of a housewife

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.420
is shown to be so powerful that though

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.060
she’s in the house, though she’s –

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.100
looks to be just a mother,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.900
but how powerful she is.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.140
But these days a new type of ideas have come up.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.820
Men also have been very nasty

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.780
and very aggressive with women.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.140
As a result we find there’s a big

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.380
opposition to men,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.140
and a kind of a big rift has been created

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.340
between men and women.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.420
Also the men, the way they started becoming licentious,

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.060
perverted,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.020
going to bad women,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.940
the good women also thought,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.820
“Why not we also become like that?”

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.780
and they also started doing wrong things

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.380
which they should not have done.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.900
That’s how the whole society crumbled down.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.780
Now, the men are responsible for the politics and the economics

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:43.300
and also the nation, as administrators,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.340
but women are responsible for the society.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.540
Whether she’s in the house or she’s outside,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.180
whether she’s working in the house or outside,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.740
she is responsible for

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.940
the maintenance of the society.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.300
And there it looks as, sometimes to a woman,

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.820
that she’s dominated,

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.820
that her husband dominates her,

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.740
that the husband’s family dominates her,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.500
but it’s the quality of a woman

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.460
that brings up the level of the society.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.900
Not only the level,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.260
but also in the family she is then respected.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.140
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.020
perhaps we never realize it.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.620
Now we see so many lights here,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.420
electricity is there running.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.340
But what is the source of this electricity?

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.940
Is it not much more important than these lights?

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.620
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.580
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.300
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.340
I was surprised when I went to

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.940
Italy also, that

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.060
how women have made themself cheap.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.180
And they want to look attractive to every man.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.620
What is the need?

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.460
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.820
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.500
This cheapness of women

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.420
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.380
I know one feels very unhappy

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.060
the way men treat them.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.940
But you must have your own personality,

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.580
you must have your own understanding

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.660
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.060
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.420
But if you do not keep to your own

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.780
personality or your chastity,

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.340
then you cannot achieve

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.860
your goal in life.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:19.260
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.620
to your husband,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.900
to all the society the woman gives power.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.140
I am also a woman, as you know,

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.060
and I also have a family.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.820
With all the powers that I have,

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.460
I never showed them that I have those powers.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.980
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.380
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.700
And he also came from a society

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.340
which was more Islamic-oriented.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.900
But that was just a joke for Me,

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.900
because I thought

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.860
“He’s just like a child

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.580
and I have to be

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.980
very patient with him.”

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.260
He always says that because of My powers

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.140
he earned everything in life.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.020
Always, in the presence of everyone he says so.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.580
I don’t know that part, but definitely

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.300
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.060
I never think the way other people think

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.380
that we must try to dominate the husband,

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.060
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.300
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.980
Also the men must realize that they have to respect women.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.460
I mean, not to such an extent that she tells you

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.780
to do something wrong,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.460
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.740
That’s slavishness.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.180
Men have to be men.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.820
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.900
I do not say it that way;

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.620
because if you have your own powers,

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.580
ultimately whatever may be the husband,

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.500
he’ll have to come and

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.860
understand what you want.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.020
He’ll have to know what you are.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.100
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.300
that it has done that way.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.820
I would never say anything.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.740
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.580
All right.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.620
After all he has to fight outside

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.780
and he has to take out temper on Me

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.100
that he couldn’t do:

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.820
if he does this to others they will beat him,

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.580
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.260
And I never, never felt that way

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.700
that he’s dominating Me.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.780
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.620
But I’ve seen that whenever

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.980
I said something to him, he thought about it.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.260
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.660
and all these decisions

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.980
he still remembers one by one

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.420
and knows that it was very, very important.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.940
Other things I never tell him what to do.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.100
Whatever was most important is the principle.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.860
Now, he also realized that

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.660
I have a very important mission.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.060
So he gave Me money, he gave Me time, gave Me all freedom.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.140
But first I had to establish Myself

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.340
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.500
The men as a whole are very different type,

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.500
you must understand.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.980
They are extroverts,

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.820
and whatever the women care

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.740
too much for, they do not.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.460
It’s all right,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.700
because women and men are complementary.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.060
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.940
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.660
who never went out,

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.420
but he knew his source of energy

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.140
from where it was coming.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.980
Because women were never respected as shakti,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.940
they started getting drifted into this Western modern ideas

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.460
that “we have to fight men,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.500
they are problematic, they are troubling us

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.460
and we should take revenge.”

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.860
That’s how society cannot work out.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.340
Responsibility of the women is much greater

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.860
than that of men.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.740
Men have to just go to offices,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.380
work it out something, come back home.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:00.140
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.460
for the growth of the children,

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.420
the protection of the husband,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.860
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.020
That’s why in India we say,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.340
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.820
and she has to be respectable.”

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.260
Moreover it is not only in India,

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.860
I’ve seen it all over that women

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.900
are always respected if they are housewives.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.100
For example,

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.300
I go with My husband to some function.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.140
I’m respected as much as he is respected.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.180
For example,

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.580
his deputy won’t be respected as I am respected,

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.820
his secretary won’t be respected.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.580
No one.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.900
I, as his wife, is respected the same way because I’m his wife.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.900
Nobody looks down upon Me

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.260
because I’m somebody’s wife.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.500
Is all over it is like this.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.460
I’ll give you a case of a lady I knew.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.340
She used to think she’s a very smart person, you know,

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.540
always looked after her body and just

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.460
to be thin and all that,

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.100
and she wanted to attract all the men

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.340
and all kinds of things,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.220
she would wear, you see, jeans and,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.660
you know, quite old lady.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.100
And her husband was a big man

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.620
he was a chief cabinet secretary,

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.860
very senior to us.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.580
So one day we were all invited for a dinner.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.420
So, she was not there.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.980
So many asked him, so many people,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.940
“Where is your wife, where is your wife?”

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.980
He said, “I don’t know where she is.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.500
She was to come here.”

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.460
I was also thinking where is she, where is she gone,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.460
because there was a seat for her, a special seat.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.060
So before sitting for the dinner

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.740
I went for, I went into the bathroom.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.500
And there the poor thing was sitting on one corner.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.340
I said, “Why are you sitting here?”

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.740
So she said, “They made me sit here.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.980
I don’t know what to do.”

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.020
So I brought her out. I said,

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.820
“Why did you make her sit there?”

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.620
And she was thinking she’s very smart

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.260
she’s done her hair nicely,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.020
she’s looking like an actress.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.700
“Oh, is she the wife?” I said, “Yes.”

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.340
“Oh, my God! We thought she’s the secretary.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.940
How could she be? She has no dignity of her own,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.660
the way she was dressed stupidly.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.260
How can we believe that she’s the wife?

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.500
She has no dignity as a wife of a Indian

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.700
gentleman so highly placed.”

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.660
And poor thing was sitting there for half-an-hour,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.940
smoking.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.460
They couldn’t believe it. Then they asked Me,

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.580
“Are You sure she’s his wife?”

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.340
I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.620
I mean, she came to the table, nobody got up for her.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.060
And they still thought, all the rest,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900
she’s the secretary who has come.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.820
Then we had to tell them, “that’s his wife.”

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.340
She was thinking she’s a smart young lady, you know;

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.020
at that old age behaving stupidly.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.660
So even in the West a woman is respected

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.300
if she’s a good housewife.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.060
Anywhere, she is respected.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.500
I was surprised also that

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.460
I knew somebody very highly placed,

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.180
a minister in the cabinet

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.700
of England,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.700
and he was

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.780
supposed to be little wayward

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.740
and nobody would take notice of him.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.820
Nobody would. “Don’t look at him!”

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.180
I was not so good at the scandals

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.780
that they had in the all diplomatic circles,

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.500
but I said that “Why don’t you talk to this man?”

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.460
“No, not worth it.”

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.740
I said, “Why?”

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:10.260
They said, “He’s horrible. He is not a good man.”

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.740
“Yes, but why? What has he done?”

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.460
They said, “He’s a flirt,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.700
and he is looking at other women

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.780
and he’s doing all kinds of things,”

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.620
and they told stories about him. My God!

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.820
Such a big man like a minister –

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.500
why is he behaving like this?

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.460
Like a stupid donkey, he is going about …

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.300
Nobody would shake hands with him.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.500
Even men would not look at him.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.300
Now, of course, a new society is forming of all these

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.100
stupid people. That’s different.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.980
But one Sahaja Yogi

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.540
who will visit these places

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.740
will be amazed how stupid they are.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.180
They can make it out.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.700
All of them catch on their Left Nabhi,

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.460
whether they are women or men.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.500
But it’s more dangerous for men if they have a wife like that.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.100
Now, the Left Nabhi if it catches, what happens?

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.700
What diseases you'll have?

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.540
The first and foremost is blood cancer.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.020
With the Left Nabhi you can get blood cancer.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.940
Women think they can dominate their husband,

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.820
they can do this to their husband,

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.620
they can put them right, but they don’t know

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.100
they are causing a serious disease like blood cancer.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.420
I know of somebody who was suffering

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.100
from blood cancer, but we cured him

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.180
and then we discovered his Left Nabhi was still bad.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.460
Again and again he was getting relapse.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.420
Then we found out it was his wife.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.860
She was such a dangerous woman for him.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.060
And he wouldn’t leave her, wouldn’t leave her.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.540
So I told him, “I will not treat you again

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.060
if you live with that woman.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.620
Better throw her out, or you send her somewhere else.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.340
But if you are going to live with this woman,

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.340
I’m not going to treat you.”

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.300
He also called her and I told her on her face

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.740
that “You’re a very dominating, horrible shrew woman,

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.620
and if you try to torture your husband,

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.500
he cannot be cured.”

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.780
But she went on.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.460
And then, the end result was horrible, horrible, horrible.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.540
He developed a big spleen like that,

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.660
all of it was taken out, and doctors told that

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.740
“within six months you’ll be finished.”

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.940
So on both the cases, I would say,

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.060
the wife tried to dominate the husband,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.700
and husband getting attached to that wife still.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.580
It’s recent case I’m telling you.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.980
Now, we are husband and wife

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.820
because we love each other, we are complementary.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.540
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.260
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.180
and women should not expect men to be like you –

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.980
very, I should say, noble.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:24.060
They are qualities of a woman and the qualities of a man.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.660
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.300
If her chastity is disturbed,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.260
then she is a dangerous person,

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.340
very dangerous.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.860
She can not only harm her husband,

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.100
but also her children, her society.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.660
We come from a culture which is very akin

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.860
to Islamic culture also.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.140
Indian culture is like that.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.460
In the Indian culture women respect their chastity

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.220
more than anything in this world.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.860
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.540
And once - there’s a story

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.540
I must tell you, very interesting,

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.740
about a very beautiful woman called Padmini.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.700
She was the wife of a king.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.060
And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.460
to see this woman, because he heard she was very beautiful.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.740
See, this is, was a funny thing.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.620
And she came, and he came to that kingdom

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.180
and he said, “I must look at this lady, otherwise

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.860
I’ll destroy the whole kingdom.”

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.180
Now people said, “This he can’t do, she’s our queen.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.700
She can’t, he can’t see our queen like that.”

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.260
She just thought, “All right. He need not see me,

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.060
but he might see my reflection.”

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.420
So she stood before a mirror

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.460
and he saw her reflection.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.700
Then he became even more mad

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.220
and he said, “I must have this woman.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.380
If you don’t give her to me,

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.260
then I’ll destroy all of you.”

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.660
Imagine a king doing all this nonsense for a woman –

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.700
shows what a useless fellow he was.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.980
So he brought all his army, everything,

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.380
and settled down near the fort

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.620
where these people were, and sent a message that

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.100
“if you don’t send this lady to me,

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.780
then I’m going to attack.”

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.380
They were not prepared, didn’t know what to do,

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.540
so they said that “Let us go and fight him.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.940
We cannot allow our queen to be given to him.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.340
This is a question of our prestige.”

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.180
They took a hundred palanquin.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.300
Do you understand palanquin?

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.380
They took a hundred palanquin.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.540
And in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.100
sitting with these arms and their machines,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.380
and there were two who were carrying them.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.860
And they said, “All right. The queen is coming with her

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.260
hundred maids.”

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.740
The Muslims that time were, the Muslim king was

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.500
having his drinks and things, very happy

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.900
that the queen is going to come.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.300
So these people went there

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.660
and came out of their palanquins and started fighting.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:27.020
They had told these women that “In case we win,

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.940
by five o’clock in the morning we’ll lit a fire

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.060
and you will see the fire,

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.860
then you’ll know that we have won the case.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:39.820
But if we do not win, then you should know

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.700
for definite that we have not won the battle.”

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.700
They were only, say, four hundred people or six hundred people,

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.220
and thousands were with this man and he had

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.980
guns and cannons and everything.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.220
So they started fighting.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.180
In that fight

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.740
that Muslim king won -

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.820
because he had so much of power -

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.780
and most of these people died. Even the king was killed.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.100
There was no fire lit at five o’clock,

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.940
so these women saw there’s no fire lit.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.780
So they made a huge big platform, a pyre,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.380
they climbed down to the pyre and lit the fire,

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.260
and they all died. Three thousand women died,

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.540
because they didn’t want other men to touch them.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.180
Any other man coming and touching them

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.380
means their chastity is finished.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.300
There are many, many stories of this kind in India.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.380
So, how they respected their chastity!

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.220
It’s easy, you see, to fall to some sort of a,

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.540
another

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.060
temptation,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.740
but if this is your power,

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.460
why you should submit yourself

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.540
to something which is so useless?

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.700
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.380
Men also must know that if their

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.620
wives are so chaste and so good,

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.940
they must respect them.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.940
They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters,

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.180
which is that we are very chaste people.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.780
We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:37.380
and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.980
who does not respect the chastity.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.900
Then the men also become chaste.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.060
When the women are chaste men also become chaste.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.540
And this chastity is your main power,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.780
is this chastity is the one is the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.860
And when you get this Shri Ganesha’s power,

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.620
you know how powerful you become

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.500
with the innocence that is awakened within you.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.860
So without the chastity the women cannot achieve

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.780
anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.460
One has to give up all the past ideas,

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.060
all the past things, and also the way there is bombardment

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.620
from the newspapers, from the media, from everything.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.540
Recently I read a beautiful book,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.420
so big as that, has come out that Media Versus America.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:39.060
In that they have said that how this media has put

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:44.380
ideas into the heads of women and men,

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.860
decrying the utility of married life

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.060
how they have killed the married life.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.100
They marry, then divorce; they marry, then divorce.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.620
The same thing goes on all the time.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.140
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, it’s not that bad.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.380
We had eighty-six weddings this time. Eighty-six.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.580
Out of which one was about to fizzle out;

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.740
that also is established.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.460
In Sahaja Yoga it’s much better.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.380
People understand the importance of married life.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.740
It’s a drama, but also it is tapas,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.660
it is a tapasya with which you understand

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.660
your own powers.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.660
I would say a man is like the sun, but

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.860
the woman is like the Mother Earth.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.700
The difference is like this:

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.860
that the sun shines, gives light,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.900
it gives also nourishment to the Mother Earth in a way;

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.940
and the Mother Earth gives everything,

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.500
she bears so much of things,

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.260
she bears all our sins.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.740
So a housewife is like the Mother Earth.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.380
She gives joy to everyone, to her husband,

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.540
to her children. She doesn’t think about herself.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.860
She doesn’t think "how I could achieve great things

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.740
through my beauty maybe, through my body,

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.260
through my education,

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.820
through my

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.940
powers that I’ve got" – no, she doesn’t.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.940
What she thinks, "how I can make others powerful,

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.140
how I can give them power, how I can help them."

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.980
This is the typical

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.460
ideology of a woman.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.820
If it is not so, then she’s not a woman.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.660
I mean, she feels – if somebody says,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.700
“I want to come to your house for dinner,”

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.300
she feels very happy. “Oh, that’s very good.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.300
Now then, what should I cook? What should I do?”

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.260
This is a woman’s attitude.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.700
Once we had a group of people, about twenty-five

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.500
of them had come to see Me.

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.660
I was sitting with them in an open space,

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.780
and then I sent word to My daughter that they are here and

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.740
it might be late, so better prepare dinner for them.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.660
After the thing I said, “There dinner is for you, let's go.”

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.980
They said, “How?” I said, “All right.”

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.100
She was so overjoyed, My daughter.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.100
She had prepared all kinds of things,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.260
her friends also came to help her.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.220
And they were surprised, all these foreigners, that

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.580
“How, Mother, she’s so happy about it?

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.700
If I tell my wife” – that’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga –

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.780
“that even three persons are coming for dinner,

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.940
she’d go round and round and round ...”

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.740
I said, “Why?”

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.220
“ … and she’d grudge and grumble,

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.940
and she’d show all her temper with the people.”

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.700
I was quite surprised.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.660
In Sahaja Yoga that’s how we live.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.700
We want to give love, and

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.820
men have to appreciate that love and enjoy that love;

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.900
whether you are a brother or a husband

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.700
or a son, any way, the woman’s love is for you.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.380
And she gives you that love that makes you absolutely,

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.060
not only joyous but also religious.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.780
Because it’s a relative thing.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.700
If a woman starts misbehaving,

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.060
that’s the worst for the society:

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.820
men also start misbehaving.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.140
Men, as it is, are extroverts.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.420
So to control them,

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.660
put them as householders,

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.540
women must know how to keep them.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.980
It’s not easy to run a house,

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.420
it’s not easy to run your family,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.940
it’s not easy to look after your children – very difficult.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.860
And those who have those qualities are the best women

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.540
and they really achieve it.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.660
I mean, you can think of your mothers,

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.460
how much they loved you,

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.540
all the men and the women.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.900
Why? Why do you think of your mother so much?

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.340
Because she sacrificed everything,

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.580
but without showing that she was sacrificing.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.980
She did so much for you, so you could...

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.460
Woman’s potential to love is tremendous,

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.340
tremendous!

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.740
And this is what we have to learn from Fatima.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.500
She gave Her two children to be killed.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.140
She knew, because She was, after all, Vishnumaya.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.860
She was the incarnation of Vishnumaya.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.820
She knew Her children will be killed,

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.900
but still She sent Her children,

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.900
“All right. Doesn’t matter.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.700
Even if I know that they are going to die, it’s all right."

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.300
Such bravery, such courage,

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.820
such understanding of the duty of Her children.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.820
Today we remember them as Hassan and Hussein.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.220
Supposing She had said, “No, no, no, no, don’t go

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.500
for the war. Stay at home.”

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.500
And if She had forced them not to go,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.820
then they would not have gone.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.540
We would not have talked about them today, isn’t it?

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.580
In any case, they would have been dead sometime,

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.180
but the death of a hero they got because of their mother.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.300
Of course, they were also a kind of incarnations,

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.700
but the way She gave them absolutely complete

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.540
encouragement, “Go and fight for the right thing.”

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.500
Because these fundamentalists

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.980
were trying to bring their fanaticism.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.260
So today is a day I have to tell men also

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:15.740
that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.220
Please understand, if your wife is a chaste woman,

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:25.500
then you have no right, in no way to trouble her.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.700
Not that she should be respectable

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.420
but you should see that everyone respects her,

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.860
nobody insults her, should stand by her,

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.460
be identified with her.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.260
But if she’s not a chaste woman

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.020
and if she is that kind, better keep out.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.460
I do not have that much courage to say that

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.140
“All right. Go ahead with her and I’ll look after.”

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.980
It’s very difficult.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.620
I don’t know what complications might come.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:00.380
With all these experiences

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.700
one learns one thing for definite,

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.220
that woman is much more inward,

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.540
she has much more powers,

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.420
she is much more wiser than other people are,

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.740
if she keeps to her chastity.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.180
That’s the point on which all her

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:29.060
movement rotates, all her personality rotates.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.260
She may be anything.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.300
We had women – like there was a lady who was

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.740
only seventeen years of age, and she became a widow.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.660
Widow she became at the age of seventeen,

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.220
and she fought a very horrible king called as

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.300
Aurangzeb, and she saw to it that he was battled;

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.060
her name was Tarabai.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.180
We have women in India of different, different,

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.460
say, characters in a way,

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.500
fighting in different, different ways,

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.060
but they were first and foremost were housewives.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.900
All their powers were there as housewives.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.340
So do not look down upon

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.220
the housewife.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.420
When I’m traveling in the plane,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.460
they ask Me, “Mother, what is your profession?”

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.900
“Housewife.”

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.420
My profession is housewife.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.260
I’m a housewife of a very, very big family.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.460
I’m looking after My children,

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.660
I’m loving them, they love Me,

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:44.340
and this profession is the best, I think,

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.180
because it is so joy-giving,

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.140
it’s so beautiful.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.980
It’s love.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.660
It’s so energy-giving.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.900
And at this age also I never feel My age,

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:07.100
because I am the Mother of so many of you.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.460
And it never comes to My head that I’m old now

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.380
and I must do so-and-so, I must take rest

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.020
and I must not do this work or that...

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.940
Because this feeling of love

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.220
for My children: I have to nourish them,

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.300
I have to look after them,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.340
because all My powers I have to give them.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.180
I never try to show off My powers to you in any way.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.860
It’s only you, who should imbibe all My powers.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.260
That’s the only desire I have,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.660
that you should be as powerful as Myself.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.180
Of course you discover it that I have powers,

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.980
but as far as I am concerned

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.740
I want that you should forget as to

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.980
what powers I have, but you should yourself

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.500
have all these powers within yourself,

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.060
so that you can save the world.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.420
That’s the only thing I want to give you.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.700
And I want to assure you that you all can have

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.540
everything that I have; only thing if you can retain –

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.860
simple thing in life – that we have to be righteous people.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.980
We cannot play about, we cannot misbehave.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.660
Nowadays so many things are coming up,

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.340
things that men are doing and women are doing;

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.300
we are not.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.900
In the evolutionary process,

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.220
as we may say that there were some monkeys - chimpanzees

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.500
that became human beings. But no,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.700
in between there were some other human beings

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.900
that came in, which vanished.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.740
So, very few people will become Sahaja Yogis,

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.860
who will be saved.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.340
All the rest will be not there -

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.660
they’ll be neither monkeys nor human beings, finished.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.260
These are all self-destroying things

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.420
which kills the family,

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.420
which kills the chastity within us,

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.540
and then we are left high and dry.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.580
We are nowhere. We have diseases, we have troubles,

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.300
we have problems. So be careful,

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.940
very, very careful.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.740
And this special puja for

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.780
Fatima Bi is

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.580
puja of Vishnumaya.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.260
Also the guilt that works on the Left Vishuddhi

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.940
can be cured if you develop your chastity.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.380
You’ll never feel guilty,

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.740
because that’s such a virtue you have.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.460
In that virtue you will never, never feel guilty,

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.540
and you can stand up to any nonsense

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.980
because you are standing on the truth of chastity.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.420
Today it’s special day, I would say, when we are

00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:02.100
worshipping this great ideal of chastity that is Fatima Bi.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.300
May God bless you.
