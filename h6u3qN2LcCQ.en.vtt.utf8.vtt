00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.159
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.638
Sorry to have kept you waiting. But Shri Mataji has come from London and

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.179
unfortunately the London Davi trains were delayed and

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.449
She should be within a few minutes. I

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.420
would like to say a few words about

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
sahaja, yoga and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.910
also about Shri Mataji

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.310
Now

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.180
Yoga as many of you may know means Union

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.999
Itself individual spirit with the universal self with a collective whole or with the divine and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.800
sahaja means

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.879
spontaneous

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:53.039
so sahaja, Europe is a spontaneous union of the individual spirit with the universal collective whole

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.680
This may sound fantastic to those of you who know that traditionally in yoga achieve yoga

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350
One had to go

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.559
to a guru or genuine teacher and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.799
Said that masters feet for many many years

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.689
One had to have great self-discipline one absolute follow rigorous diets and follow various exercises

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.060
Oh

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.220
These many years

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.429
at the feet of a guru or teacher

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.419
Who not only gives you this yoga?

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.090
in a very short time span

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.148
spontaneously without any effort on your part

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.959
She also awakens within you

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.769
your own part where by itself

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440
Can give realization to others

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.519
Now this is something that is totally unique. And if you know the tradition of yoga and the way I approach the teacher

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.410
Then he will know that before us. It's a very special teacher and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.630
In fact in India many great Saints every noise

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.450
Shri. Mataji

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.389
Personality who would bring the Maha yoga

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:47.279
To this world the great yoga the yoga that is the culmination of human evolution. That is yoga of all yoga's

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.309
Taught throughout the ages and to try and describe the passage. It's very difficult

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.720
you have to actually experience her and the way I like to explain it is that if you have a telescope and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.799
It is a dirty to scope and I tell you they are ring on the planet Saturn and its

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.789
dirty telescope won't anything and you'll say I'm like

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.299
but if I taught you a technique I buy painless go gradually at both ends and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.119
one day when this telescope is clean, you will see the rings around Saturn annuals BR and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.030
Similarly is pooja yoga

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.359
Because most of us are not sensitive enough they spent the whole lifetime or half a lifetime

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.470
damaging ourselves in various ways being conditioned by society

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.810
parents and so on we have lost one genuine and where they are you can perceive a spiritually evolved B and

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.489
inside yoga techniques are taught whereby you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.600
Android spirit she's a tremendous enjoyable thing and

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.569
spread this to others

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.450
Now, I know you all would like very much

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.620
And I would request that

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.720
You listen to her with an open mind

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.999
Try be a scientist because scientists supposed to be the thing

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.729
okay, now scientists never goes in skeptically he goes in with an opening and is

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.750
See what there is

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.540
Listen to there is to say and let to experiment because Saji okay is practical

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.079
You can experiment with it and you prove it to yourselves

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.919
it is not theoretical you have come here tonight to actually get an experience not to just hear words and

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.879
Shri Mataji is the one who can give you the experience. I

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.979
Welcome Shri Mataji to Darlene. We are greatly honored to have her and

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.410
Shri Mataji will now give us all her words

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.469
Those of us who haven't had it we will get our realization tonight if we desire it sufficiently remarketing I

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.729
Bow to all the seekers of truth

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.510
It's a great pleasure come to Dobby and I must

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330
Extend my apologies

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.570
Getting late as a train was late from London

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.660
We are here today

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.979
To know about what we are about

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.539
We are going to be

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.340
All these questions

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.630
Relate to the unknown

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.010
knowledge of our roots

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.409
What rapport from any other memory

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.269
Is the knowledge of the tree

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.150
This is knowledge of the roots

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.660
Which

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.120
Nourishes us

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.240
Which gives a growth

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.630
Which gives a desire

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.230
Which

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.250
Works out all our actions physical and mental

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.439
The problem is and we are dealing with the

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.879
Speed as in the West

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.500
We seldom forget that that

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.560
Has to be related

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.170
the growth of the root

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.970
When in the West the tree was growing so fast

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.600
Yeah people

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.319
Understanding trying to meditate about the roots

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.040
As

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.120
The East has to learn scientific ways from the West

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.260
The Western people have to learn about the root

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.170
think that

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.990
Something is correct

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.860
The roots have no meaning

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.760
without

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.039
The tree and tree has existence without the roots

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.590
Whether you are born in the east west north south

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.300
All of us have got a human body and

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:04.400
Human body is a very special thing. But God Almighty has given us it's a miraculous thing

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.379
of course these days all the intellectuals are trying to

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.770
challenge the radicals

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.590
Even need to quit poly outside. It's a very miraculous thing

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.059
We take everything and in a way is good

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:29.330
then if you had not taken it for granted, we would have a very different type of

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.470
Laws

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.080
That govern us

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.690
Are the divine laws

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.210
Led wineyards

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.290
One has to enter into the kingdom of God

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.479
it's a prophetic imaginary when people talk of

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.830
Or not is really think of

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:19.460
It is not that can decide about it only by discussing it arguing it the television

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.250
person, who are

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:30.829
And when they argue can see clearly that they cannot conceal what lives he says

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.139
This is my faith. Another says this is my

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.869
The faith is blind and the reasoning is stunted

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.520
Because we reason out everything through this brain, which is a limited

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:51.080
as it is one tenth of the brain we can use mostly the same, but you

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.060
Think

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.060
If you have to talk about something

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.870
unlimited

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:05.239
then we have boom beyond reasoning we don't blind faith and we have to experience it on our

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.690
central nervous

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.690
system

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.510
All our evolution that's taken place so far

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.780
has be

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:21.710
in the central and still recorded like you see that dog cannot

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.250
Anything pass through any dirty?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.640
table to cross

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:33.349
So many things we are aware

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.589
So ways we are aware that

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.100
But still

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.689
Why the human being are in such a confusion in?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.409
These modern times you find the certificate

00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:56.239
All sorts of ideas are coming up about

00:10:56.939 --> 00:10:58.939
health education

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.249
of politics economics

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.470
God-realization

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.680
all sorts of markets re

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:08.910
and

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.969
one gets so confused that

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.089
One does not know how to believe

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.180
in to visit

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.769
What we have to understand that

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:29.029
Have to believe in things which can be proved. Now. The time has come

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.110
At

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.750
Why it's
