00:05.698 --> 00:09.989
Today's Puja of Vishnumaya,

00:10.239 --> 00:12.738
who was the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:16.364 --> 00:19.614
was not scheduled as such in an international

00:20.030 --> 00:21.489
pujas that we do.

00:22.698 --> 00:25.614
But they say for the love of God

00:27.030 --> 00:33.156
when all the devotees assemble,

00:34.364 --> 00:37.489
God also has to break many rules,

00:38.322 --> 00:44.364
and that's how this puja has been accepted to be done.

00:44.698 --> 00:48.738
At least once it should be done, I think, was a good idea.

00:49.448 --> 00:50.905
By your love

00:51.489 --> 00:58.030
and your devotion it was desired,

00:59.322 --> 01:02.780
and so this puja is going to be performed.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.738
It's just spontaneous

01:07.114 --> 01:10.864
that I happened to be in England at this time,

01:11.114 --> 01:13.738
because this puja if ever had happened,

01:13.989 --> 01:15.614
would have happened in India.

01:16.614 --> 01:21.905
Because this is a puja of a deity,

01:23.573 --> 01:25.030
Vishnumaya,

01:26.573 --> 01:31.780
the seed of which is not easy to plant

01:33.322 --> 01:34.738
in the Western countries.

01:37.114 --> 01:42.573
Now the whole shakti programming has been done

01:44.239 --> 01:48.573
in such a way that we have Mother as a Shakti first,

01:49.322 --> 01:50.780
the Primordial Mother.

01:51.322 --> 01:54.197
Then we have three shaktis coming out of Her,

01:54.197 --> 01:56.905
as you know - Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

01:57.656 --> 02:02.197
And then we have children from them:

02:04.448 --> 02:05.989
brothers and sisters.

02:06.322 --> 02:10.573
So before the power

02:11.239 --> 02:14.239
of what we call the wife or the spouse was created,

02:14.698 --> 02:16.905
is the power of the sister is created.

02:17.448 --> 02:20.989
So, as you know that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha were born

02:20.989 --> 02:22.698
to these three Shaktis,

02:22.698 --> 02:25.030
and they all had sisters.

02:25.864 --> 02:28.364
And their sisters were married

02:29.698 --> 02:35.197
- like Vishnu's sister is Parvati

02:35.656 --> 02:38.364
and She was married to Shiva.

02:39.448 --> 02:41.364
Is very important to understand

02:41.780 --> 02:45.197
that these three types of powers

02:45.197 --> 02:49.698
always play on the chakras.

02:50.072 --> 02:52.239
And if you understand these three powers,

02:52.239 --> 02:53.656
how they play,

02:54.030 --> 02:55.364
then you will understand

02:55.656 --> 02:59.239
what is the importance of Vishnumaya is.

02:59.656 --> 03:04.656
Vishnumaya is the power of a sister in a family.

03:05.030 --> 03:09.489
So the female is the power,

03:09.989 --> 03:14.114
and the male is the kinetic power

03:14.989 --> 03:18.573
which asserts the powers

03:18.989 --> 03:24.448
of these three powers which surround him.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.698
So when the male power comes in,

03:29.030 --> 03:31.489
all these powers become

03:33.656 --> 03:39.322
helpful acting associates with that power.

03:40.573 --> 03:44.239
Now Vishnumaya's power is very important to understand,

03:44.239 --> 03:47.573
because Mother power is to protect your innocence,

03:47.573 --> 03:49.822
because that is the most important thing.

03:49.822 --> 03:53.114
To protect your innocence is the Mother's power.

03:53.656 --> 03:58.822
Now, Vishnumaya's power is to protect your chastity.

04:00.864 --> 04:04.406
You don't understand sometimes what is chastity

04:04.656 --> 04:06.947
and what is innocence.

04:07.656 --> 04:11.698
Innocence is a power which is not acted upon.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.406
Like we have electricity in our house,

04:15.114 --> 04:19.322
the electricity exists like innocence exists within us;

04:19.739 --> 04:25.822
but enactment of that is done through chastity.

04:26.281 --> 04:27.822
A person can say,

04:27.822 --> 04:31.239
"I did this very innocently" - no, he cannot.

04:31.698 --> 04:34.197
Because whatever you do if it is innocent,

04:34.531 --> 04:37.114
cannot be harmful to your character,

04:37.531 --> 04:41.698
to your innocence or to your righteousness.

04:42.239 --> 04:43.780
So those people who say like this,

04:43.780 --> 04:46.448
that "I did it innocently" are wrong,

04:46.989 --> 04:50.739
because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity.

04:51.614 --> 04:55.573
So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity.

04:56.448 --> 04:59.905
You must have respect of your chastity.

05:00.905 --> 05:04.322
Chastity is the one which is Vishnumaya's power within us,

05:04.322 --> 05:07.156
Gauri's power, is the pure virgin.

05:07.156 --> 05:08.864
She doesn't marry.

05:10.448 --> 05:12.739
As you know that Vishnumaya was created,

05:13.030 --> 05:16.905
just after Her birth She was killed by Kamsa.

05:18.573 --> 05:23.364
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us,

05:23.780 --> 05:26.864
we have to know that chastity is the foundation

05:27.114 --> 05:28.739
of all dharmas.

05:29.114 --> 05:31.489
Unless and until you have sense of chastity

05:31.780 --> 05:33.364
you cannot have dharma.

05:33.864 --> 05:36.905
Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation.

05:37.239 --> 05:39.489
It will be a house of cards;

05:39.780 --> 05:43.448
if you do not have the foundation of chastity

05:43.739 --> 05:46.698
it will just collapse in no time.

05:47.489 --> 05:50.239
So is a very important thing is chastity

05:50.489 --> 05:52.864
which has been challenged in the West throughout,

05:52.864 --> 05:55.114
and that's why I'm saying is difficult

05:55.114 --> 05:57.489
to sow the seed of chastity in this country.

05:57.739 --> 05:58.989
And that it should happen,

05:59.239 --> 06:02.322
there must be some divine plan I think,

06:02.322 --> 06:05.780
that it has happened that this great puja

06:05.780 --> 06:06.989
should be performed here.

06:07.239 --> 06:08.864
It's not a easy puja to do

06:08.864 --> 06:11.114
- is to be done by people who are innocent,

06:11.573 --> 06:14.573
done by people who have lead a very religious life;

06:14.780 --> 06:16.364
those who have been very chaste,

06:16.656 --> 06:18.322
have respected their chastity.

06:18.322 --> 06:19.780
But now as you are saints,

06:20.030 --> 06:24.072
before you everything is pure and good,

06:24.072 --> 06:27.322
because now you have been leading a saintly life.

06:27.322 --> 06:31.364
That's why chastity has become awakened in you,

06:31.364 --> 06:35.114
and chastity works in you as Gauri, as your kundalini.

06:35.614 --> 06:40.656
So if you come to the essence of religious life,

06:40.905 --> 06:44.989
of righteous life, of Sahaja Yoga life, is chastity.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.989
You cannot diversify it.

06:49.864 --> 06:53.322
Now this chastity gives you the maryadas,

06:53.573 --> 06:54.905
means delimits you.

07:00.573 --> 07:02.114
(Why are you sitting here?

07:02.114 --> 07:04.114
Go further, it's better to be in front.

07:04.114 --> 07:05.989
This is - you are not doing the puja.

07:06.239 --> 07:08.114
If you are doing the puja, then you sit here.

07:08.114 --> 07:09.905
Otherwise, better sit down.

07:09.905 --> 07:11.739
Better get My vibrations there,

07:11.739 --> 07:14.239
in front. Here, come along.)

07:16.739 --> 07:22.738
So the chastity is the one that gives you maryadas,

07:23.030 --> 07:24.614
gives you the limits.

07:24.947 --> 07:26.656
How does it give you the limits?

07:27.322 --> 07:31.156
Like the, in the sky is the lightning.

07:31.780 --> 07:35.364
When the two clouds,

07:35.780 --> 07:37.864
who are like Sahaja yogis we can say,

07:38.156 --> 07:42.322
came out of the sea

07:43.239 --> 07:44.072
and pure water is

07:52.239 --> 07:54.780
there in the, those clouds,

07:55.114 --> 07:57.738
and they have to be poured out;

07:58.989 --> 08:03.156
when they come closer together

08:03.864 --> 08:06.448
and cross their limits of their ego,

08:06.448 --> 08:10.614
or fight with each other or in any way clash,

08:10.989 --> 08:14.489
is, there is this chastity,

08:14.739 --> 08:17.030
this lightning that takes place.

08:17.448 --> 08:21.197
This lightning which says that

08:21.197 --> 08:24.489
"You are wrong. Why are you fighting among yourself?

08:24.739 --> 08:26.989
Why are you crossing each other's ego?"

08:27.239 --> 08:28.780
That's the sister's job.

08:29.114 --> 08:31.322
Yesterday we have had many sisters.

08:31.614 --> 08:34.239
Now the sister's job is not to take sides,

08:34.780 --> 08:37.489
but to show that if you cross your limits

08:37.739 --> 08:38.989
of your brotherliness,

08:39.322 --> 08:42.156
then there will be a lightning.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.905
Now this power of lightning

08:46.573 --> 08:49.989
is a part of the power of Shri Krishna

08:50.322 --> 08:52.573
which He took it out from Himself.

08:53.573 --> 08:56.489
That's why He became such a sweet,

08:58.364 --> 09:00.989
gentle incarnation.

09:01.239 --> 09:02.239
He took it out.

09:02.239 --> 09:04.030
He said, "Now you've become My sister,

09:04.030 --> 09:08.698
and every time they try to misbehave you better work it out.

09:08.989 --> 09:13.864
And that's how Shri Krishna became such a gentle and a very,

09:14.239 --> 09:17.448
as they call it, romantic incarnation;

09:18.448 --> 09:21.030
because He took out the sisterly part away

09:21.573 --> 09:22.780
and He worked it out.

09:22.780 --> 09:25.531
But She was always with Him

09:25.531 --> 09:26.738
and She worked with Him;

09:27.030 --> 09:28.822
because the sister in the family

09:29.114 --> 09:31.531
has to see that the brothers don't fight,

09:31.947 --> 09:33.614
they are all looked after well,

09:33.905 --> 09:36.406
that they are not challenged by others,

09:36.406 --> 09:38.698
that she gives them the maryadas

09:38.698 --> 09:42.780
how far to go - how far to go.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.780
Now it's very important,

09:45.030 --> 09:48.406
very, very important for all of us to understand

09:49.030 --> 09:53.406
that Freud and all these nonsensical people

09:53.698 --> 10:00.406
brought forth the theories to challenge Vishnumaya,

10:01.947 --> 10:08.947
so that we should have all kinds of funny relationships,

10:08.947 --> 10:11.281
which is an impossibility,

10:11.698 --> 10:12.905
is a wrong thing.

10:13.156 --> 10:16.489
Now if there is any relationship like that

10:17.614 --> 10:21.156
between brothers and sisters,

10:21.614 --> 10:25.822
for seven generations the family suffers

10:26.072 --> 10:29.239
from terrible diseases - seven generations.

10:32.738 --> 10:36.531
But if there's another like Freud-style relationship,

10:36.531 --> 10:40.905
then fourteen generations the family has to suffer.

10:42.114 --> 10:46.489
So the limiting forces of Vishnumaya are such

10:46.738 --> 10:50.448
that your ego is controlled, your superego is controlled,

10:51.030 --> 10:53.114
your family is controlled.

10:53.448 --> 10:55.489
Everybody is under control,

10:55.738 --> 11:00.364
under the guidance of this pure power of Vishnumaya

11:01.030 --> 11:03.489
which exists within all of us.

11:04.905 --> 11:06.989
And the saddest part is that

11:06.989 --> 11:08.698
in all the Western countries

11:08.698 --> 11:12.364
Vishnumaya is sick, absolutely sick.

11:12.780 --> 11:14.905
I mean, I have lost My hearing even,

11:15.156 --> 11:17.281
up to that point it has come,

11:17.698 --> 11:18.905
on the left-hand side,

11:18.905 --> 11:24.364
because the sense of chastity is completely lacking.

11:25.698 --> 11:27.698
We have to forget about the people now

11:28.030 --> 11:31.822
who have no sense at all, but now we are Sahaja yogis.

11:32.239 --> 11:35.114
So coming to the right point, we have to say that,

11:35.406 --> 11:39.489
that many people have still some lingering funny ideas,

11:39.780 --> 11:42.822
like "I have a good friendship with that gentleman"

11:43.239 --> 11:45.780
or "I'm very friendly with such and such gentleman"

11:46.030 --> 11:47.030
and all that.

11:47.030 --> 11:48.947
It's not a maryada then.

11:49.738 --> 11:55.281
You cannot have friendship with - between men and women,

11:55.281 --> 11:58.989
you cannot, it's absolutely absurd.

11:58.989 --> 12:01.239
In the West the whole culture is funny;

12:01.239 --> 12:03.114
because if you go to a dinner party

12:03.114 --> 12:04.989
you are supposed to sit with somebody's husband

12:05.281 --> 12:07.364
on both the sides - horrible!

12:08.114 --> 12:11.030
But in the East it's not done,

12:12.364 --> 12:15.364
because the Vishnumaya is against these things.

12:15.614 --> 12:19.156
She will see to it that husband and wife sit together.

12:21.364 --> 12:24.364
Now here, as you know, the chastity part

12:24.698 --> 12:25.905
is so much missing

12:25.905 --> 12:28.030
that our left Vishuddhis are catching.

12:28.406 --> 12:31.114
And when I talk about it, it catches more.

12:32.281 --> 12:33.905
Now when you say you are not guilty,

12:33.905 --> 12:36.905
you are actually admitting it to Vishnumaya,

12:37.156 --> 12:38.156
to your own sister,

12:38.406 --> 12:41.698
saying that "I am not guilty."

12:41.698 --> 12:44.905
But She doesn't like you to have the guilt upon you.

12:44.905 --> 12:47.364
The wife may like you to have the guilt.

12:47.364 --> 12:49.406
She may like that you should have the guilt,

12:49.738 --> 12:52.030
because she thinks her power is challenged

12:52.281 --> 12:55.989
and that she has somebody who is her rival.

12:56.281 --> 12:59.905
But not, not Vishnumaya;

12:59.905 --> 13:02.698
the sister does not say that.

13:02.989 --> 13:06.780
But a brother and a sister are never friends.

13:07.822 --> 13:09.780
Now in a group we are sitting here.

13:09.780 --> 13:14.114
Like that, in any group a brother and a sister,

13:14.573 --> 13:17.780
they are, they know that they exist as brothers and sisters

13:18.156 --> 13:19.905
but they don't cling onto one person,

13:19.905 --> 13:21.364
they don't talk to one person,

13:21.364 --> 13:24.281
they don't get friendly with that sister.

13:24.822 --> 13:28.489
Like once we had a big fate with these Christians once,

13:28.738 --> 13:31.156
I remember, and I must be having at least

13:31.406 --> 13:35.489
thirty cousins and four, five brothers I had at that time.

13:36.614 --> 13:38.614
And we went to that function,

13:38.614 --> 13:40.239
and among Indian Christians

13:40.489 --> 13:44.614
we have Christians from all kinds of stratas.

13:44.905 --> 13:49.114
So there were some vagabonds I think,

13:49.114 --> 13:51.573
they passed some remarks about us,

13:51.780 --> 13:53.614
we sisters, you see.

13:54.738 --> 13:56.364
We didn't know we had so many cousins.

13:56.698 --> 13:59.780
They all shot out, you see, just like jack-in-the-box,

14:00.156 --> 14:04.114
and they all took over and started beating those boys.

14:04.364 --> 14:06.864
And then we realized so many cousins we have.

14:06.864 --> 14:08.364
Otherwise we never knew;

14:08.364 --> 14:10.780
they were somewhere, we were not talking to them much,

14:10.780 --> 14:13.156
we were talking among ourselves, our friends,

14:13.156 --> 14:14.905
we girls were talking to each other.

14:14.905 --> 14:17.030
Suddenly we found we have so many cousins

14:17.030 --> 14:19.738
and so many brothers. It was most surprising

14:20.030 --> 14:22.156
that we should have so many cousins there

14:22.448 --> 14:23.239
we did not know.

14:23.239 --> 14:26.030
Immediately they jumped on the protection

14:26.448 --> 14:28.573
of the chastity of their sister,

14:28.573 --> 14:31.738
because she is the basis of their chastity.

14:33.114 --> 14:37.573
But normally you don't talk to your brother much,

14:38.114 --> 14:41.573
nor the brother talks to you so much,

14:42.030 --> 14:43.156
you don't get friendly.

14:43.156 --> 14:46.489
But at the time of difficulties, at the time of maryadas,

14:46.738 --> 14:51.780
at the time of consulting about something

14:52.030 --> 14:54.698
that is dear to the family, the sister comes in.

14:55.489 --> 14:57.322
Recently My own brother, younger brother,

14:57.322 --> 14:58.364
wrote a letter to Me

14:58.364 --> 15:00.322
because there's a problem in the family.

15:00.573 --> 15:04.739
Now My mother is not there, and normally a sister is better

15:04.989 --> 15:09.573
because she is easily available to you than the mother.

15:09.573 --> 15:11.322
Mother is so busy with the whole family,

15:11.322 --> 15:12.905
the whole work, you know what she's doing.

15:12.905 --> 15:16.072
So the sisterly feeling is very important.

15:16.364 --> 15:20.698
Now just imagine that our left Vishuddhi is so bad.

15:26.656 --> 15:28.197
It is, of course,

15:28.448 --> 15:30.573
because we have never cared for our chastity,

15:30.864 --> 15:33.448
we have not respected our chastity.

15:33.947 --> 15:35.947
In India it is not so.

15:36.197 --> 15:40.739
Women and men all respect their chastity very much.

15:41.156 --> 15:43.864
And I've asked some foreign-going boys,

15:44.156 --> 15:46.531
they said that "Though we were doing all wrong things

15:46.531 --> 15:49.322
as they were doing, we all the time somehow knew

15:49.738 --> 15:51.156
that we were doing wrong."

15:51.156 --> 15:52.156
I said, "How is it?"

15:52.156 --> 15:55.072
He said, "There's something like a sister's relationship."

15:58.281 --> 16:01.822
But now I can say that Indian men are also becoming

16:01.822 --> 16:03.281
just like you people,

16:03.531 --> 16:06.573
and have lost their power to keep their chastity.

16:06.947 --> 16:09.406
The men must respect their chastity,

16:09.989 --> 16:14.281
because they think they do not owe anything to the chastity.

16:14.947 --> 16:21.406
And if the basis of your spiritual existence

16:21.822 --> 16:24.573
doesn't exist, you'll collapse in no time.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.989
For that I have many a times said that

16:27.989 --> 16:32.156
put your attention on the Mother Earth, the green.

16:32.531 --> 16:33.738
Green is the color,

16:33.738 --> 16:35.822
if you put your attention into that

16:36.072 --> 16:39.947
then you will be saved

16:40.406 --> 16:44.156
from these errors you are committing of adultery

16:44.156 --> 16:45.864
all the time,

16:46.656 --> 16:48.156
your looking at others' sisters,

16:48.406 --> 16:51.322
others' wives, others' daughters.

16:52.656 --> 16:53.822
So the relationship

16:53.822 --> 16:56.531
that is now being expressed, as you know,

16:56.531 --> 16:57.364
is of a daughter,

17:02.030 --> 17:05.738
of a sister and of a mother,

17:06.156 --> 17:09.822
which is a very, very pure relationship.

17:11.698 --> 17:16.239
So much so that now, supposing you use your brains too much,

17:16.489 --> 17:19.573
then why does your heart catch - have you thought of that?

17:19.864 --> 17:24.739
Why does your heart catch when you use right side too much?

17:29.780 --> 17:33.114
What is the reason for catching your heart?

17:33.448 --> 17:35.905
Must understand this, it's the same thing.

17:36.573 --> 17:42.489
The relationship of, say, Shiva is to Vishnu in two ways.

17:43.864 --> 17:49.780
Firstly Vishnu's wife - the sister, He has married.

17:51.739 --> 17:52.698
All right?

17:52.905 --> 17:56.489
Then who is the sister of Shiva?

17:57.739 --> 18:00.197
Shiva's sister is Saraswati.

18:00.614 --> 18:03.780
If you work too much on Saraswati, heart will catch.

18:04.364 --> 18:05.698
It has maryadas.

18:09.905 --> 18:12.322
This is how the intermarriages took place,

18:12.573 --> 18:14.573
by which the sister's relationship

18:14.864 --> 18:19.905
is worked out to keep your maryadas of your chakras.

18:21.239 --> 18:22.489
If you cross that,

18:22.739 --> 18:24.656
you suddenly get into the left or the right

18:24.656 --> 18:27.364
because you have crossed the maryadas of that.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.448
Now this sisterly relationship existed

18:31.738 --> 18:34.573
in other incarnations also;

18:34.573 --> 18:36.489
like Mohammed Sahib

18:37.156 --> 18:39.448
had a sisterly relationship

18:40.322 --> 18:47.114
with - actually what we have to say that

18:47.656 --> 18:50.364
His sister as such was Ali's wife,

18:50.364 --> 18:53.698
but She was born to Him as a daughter.

18:54.989 --> 18:59.656
So they can be born as the daughter or as the sister.

19:00.114 --> 19:03.197
She was born as Nanaka's sister, Nanaki.

19:04.656 --> 19:07.989
She was born as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib.

19:08.239 --> 19:14.072
So it could be a sister or could be

19:15.322 --> 19:19.364
the daughter of an incarnation.

19:19.698 --> 19:25.947
But daughter and sister are innocent, pure chastity.

19:27.448 --> 19:30.114
Now think of it, that those people

19:30.114 --> 19:36.698
who cannot understand the importance of chastity,

19:37.364 --> 19:42.114
how can they talk of any laws whatsoever?

19:44.989 --> 19:48.114
- because "laws" means maryadas,

19:49.448 --> 19:53.698
and it has the proper sense

19:54.698 --> 19:57.197
through the power of Vishnumaya.

19:58.448 --> 20:02.656
Now you might say that not to steal anybody else's thing

20:05.239 --> 20:10.072
is also not proper, because it belongs to somebody else.

20:10.698 --> 20:12.698
But who will tell you?

20:13.114 --> 20:16.364
Who is the one that is going to tell you that this is wrong?

20:16.364 --> 20:18.614
Of course, there is police, but

20:18.822 --> 20:20.364
who has told?

20:20.698 --> 20:22.114
The lawmakers.

20:22.905 --> 20:26.364
Which part of the unconscious has played is the Vishnumaya;

20:27.114 --> 20:30.738
because as soon as you steal something you feel guilty.

20:32.406 --> 20:35.364
In the law also this word "guilty" is used.

20:35.947 --> 20:40.531
And guilty comes from the left side, is Vishnumaya.

20:44.947 --> 20:49.030
So how important it is to have a sense of chastity.

20:49.738 --> 20:51.738
But we are very divided people,

20:51.738 --> 20:54.738
and those who have moral chastity

20:54.738 --> 20:57.114
may not have material chastity.

20:58.406 --> 21:00.780
Those who have got material chastity

21:01.030 --> 21:03.281
may not have moral chastity.

21:05.239 --> 21:07.114
Moral chastity comes first,

21:07.114 --> 21:08.531
that's very important,

21:08.531 --> 21:09.905
because it is innate.

21:10.239 --> 21:18.489
And if your moral chastity is perfectly nourished,

21:19.239 --> 21:24.738
then automatically the material chastity comes in.

21:25.489 --> 21:27.281
But the effect is the same.

21:27.822 --> 21:31.822
Whether you do money cheating in Sahaja Yoga

21:32.239 --> 21:34.239
or whether you cheat morally,

21:34.239 --> 21:35.947
your left Vishuddhi will be caught,

21:36.239 --> 21:40.114
and the whole problem will start from left Vishuddhi.

21:40.573 --> 21:44.114
Now supposing somebody tries to cheat in Sahaja Yoga,

21:44.406 --> 21:47.030
want to take away the money of Sahaja Yoga

21:47.281 --> 21:48.239
or something like that.

21:48.531 --> 21:51.738
Immediately his left Vishuddhi will be caught.

21:52.156 --> 21:54.738
As soon as the left Vishuddhi will be caught

21:55.364 --> 21:57.281
he will start behaving in a funny manner,

21:57.573 --> 21:58.947
the whole catch will be shown.

21:59.364 --> 22:01.322
If you become immoral also

22:01.322 --> 22:03.448
the left Vishuddhi will be caught.

22:03.698 --> 22:07.864
Now the whole guilt part comes from there.

22:08.739 --> 22:12.531
Sin against the Mother could be also an insult,

22:12.739 --> 22:14.780
in any way answering back to Mother.

22:15.072 --> 22:18.698
Many people have a habit, I've seen, of saying,

22:19.197 --> 22:20.197
"No, Mother."

22:20.573 --> 22:23.322
"No" is never to be said,

22:23.739 --> 22:24.989
because if you say "no"

22:24.989 --> 22:27.364
that means you go to the left Vishuddhi.

22:27.780 --> 22:32.448
The Vishnumaya power will not tolerate your "no"

22:32.448 --> 22:33.739
for anything at all.

22:33.739 --> 22:37.114
Many people have a habit of saying this, "No, Mother."

22:38.072 --> 22:39.322
This is not to be done,

22:39.322 --> 22:43.448
because once you catch your left Vishuddhi

22:43.780 --> 22:46.364
all your left chakras become weak,

22:46.364 --> 22:50.322
because the chastity which is the basis of all the chakras

22:51.114 --> 22:52.739
is weak.

22:53.531 --> 22:55.448
So how much important it is

22:55.739 --> 23:01.364
to understand the value of left Vishuddhi.

23:02.072 --> 23:03.573
All of us catch on left Vishuddhi,

23:03.780 --> 23:07.739
and we do not think that it is such an important thing.

23:07.739 --> 23:09.364
But we say, "Oh, left Vishuddhi catching

23:09.364 --> 23:10.448
means I'm feeling guilty."

23:10.448 --> 23:13.531
We do not understand that "What have I done?

23:13.531 --> 23:16.698
I have crossed the limits, that's why is showing there.

23:18.322 --> 23:21.239
I've neglected some kind of a morality.

23:21.531 --> 23:24.780
I've gone on a wrong path against Mother

23:25.072 --> 23:28.656
and Father, that's why left Vishuddhi's catching."

23:28.656 --> 23:33.322
Left Vishuddhi is the indication of the mistakes,

23:33.780 --> 23:36.322
of the wrongs, of the sins.

23:36.656 --> 23:38.947
We can't afford to have left Vishuddhi,

23:39.322 --> 23:42.239
Sahaja yogis cannot afford to have left Vishuddhi.

23:42.531 --> 23:45.072
To add to the trouble, they smoke,

23:45.531 --> 23:47.072
they take all kinds of things.

23:48.114 --> 23:52.989
In India they take what you call tamakhu,

23:53.322 --> 23:57.573
is a kind of a - what leaves are these? - tobacco leaves,

23:57.989 --> 24:02.448
and they think they have done no wrong.

24:02.698 --> 24:04.739
But left Vishuddhi catches.

24:04.989 --> 24:08.947
Left Vishuddhi, in a way, is the gateway

24:09.364 --> 24:13.114
to all kinds of problems for yourself,

24:13.656 --> 24:17.448
so be careful not to feel guilty about anything.

24:18.738 --> 24:21.406
Moreover it's a very vicious - great vicious circle.

24:21.656 --> 24:24.364
For example, somebody has done something wrong.

24:25.489 --> 24:30.156
I have decided that I have to tell them on their face

24:30.156 --> 24:32.531
whether they like it or not, this is wrong,

24:32.739 --> 24:34.656
as far as possible. Of course,

24:34.656 --> 24:38.156
I try to play sometimes tricks on them to understand,

24:38.406 --> 24:41.656
if they do not understand My telling them - up to a point.

24:42.072 --> 24:45.656
And then I tell them that "Now you better get out.

24:45.656 --> 24:47.822
I cannot have you in My body any more."

24:48.156 --> 24:49.822
So I throw them out of Sahaja Yoga.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.281
Once they're out of Sahaja Yoga at least

24:51.573 --> 24:52.905
My headache is over.

24:53.989 --> 24:55.905
Now what I have seen that

24:56.156 --> 25:01.239
when this negativity starts acting, people,

25:01.698 --> 25:05.156
instead of facing it, facing the mistakes that "I am wrong,

25:05.156 --> 25:07.698
I should not have done it, it's a wrong thing to do,"

25:07.989 --> 25:09.989
start giving explanations.

25:10.281 --> 25:11.738
Once you start giving explanation,

25:12.030 --> 25:18.738
this left Vishuddhi starts becoming like a bloated big lump,

25:19.281 --> 25:22.156
and then there's no possibility of curing,

25:22.156 --> 25:24.281
no possibility of cleansing.

25:24.614 --> 25:26.322
So people start giving explanation,

25:26.614 --> 25:28.738
"Why I did it, why I did this."

25:28.947 --> 25:31.406
Once it is said is wrong, is wrong;

25:31.822 --> 25:32.738
to be accepted,

25:32.947 --> 25:34.738
"All right, next time I'm not going to do it,

25:34.947 --> 25:36.864
I'm very sorry." But "sorry"

25:36.864 --> 25:40.864
seems to be a very difficult word for at least

25:41.739 --> 25:42.864
Western Sahaja yogis

25:42.864 --> 25:45.322
and some of the Indian Sahaja yogis also,

25:45.322 --> 25:47.739
to say, "Sorry, I'm very sorry."

25:48.072 --> 25:51.030
Indians never feel guilty, is a good idea,

25:51.322 --> 25:56.322
but they never say sorry, so it's just the same.

26:00.656 --> 26:02.656
Now one has to understand

26:02.656 --> 26:04.989
that when you have committed a mistake,

26:05.239 --> 26:07.780
you are a human being: to error is human

26:08.072 --> 26:09.739
and to forgive, divine.

26:10.072 --> 26:12.239
But you must know that you have erred.

26:12.573 --> 26:16.072
If you go on giving explanations then one thing is definite,

26:16.072 --> 26:18.780
you do not understand that God knows everything.

26:21.072 --> 26:24.239
If He says you have done wrong, then it is a wrong.

26:25.698 --> 26:27.448
How can you challenge, how can you say,

26:27.698 --> 26:29.489
"This is the reason I did it. That's the reason"

26:29.489 --> 26:31.739
- it's the thing one must understand.

26:32.239 --> 26:34.364
Because this is the power of electricity,

26:34.364 --> 26:36.489
you must understand, gives you a shock.

26:37.197 --> 26:39.030
It shocks you.

26:39.656 --> 26:42.656
And then you realize that "I have done a mistake."

26:42.656 --> 26:45.573
So don't create a shock for yourself.

26:46.239 --> 26:47.698
Do not behave in a manner

26:47.698 --> 26:50.698
that ultimately you end up with a shock.

26:51.197 --> 26:54.239
It's - of course, the Mother's power is so forgiving,

26:54.698 --> 26:57.739
Sadashiva's power is so forgiving that you are allowed,

26:57.739 --> 26:59.739
and allowed, and allowed

26:59.989 --> 27:03.656
to continue with what you are doing, for a while.

27:03.864 --> 27:06.322
But it's been told,

27:06.322 --> 27:08.698
is explained to you that this is wrong.

27:09.072 --> 27:13.322
But supposing you cross your limits absolutely,

27:13.573 --> 27:16.197
then suddenly the Vishnumaya appears

27:16.197 --> 27:18.531
and the whole thing gets exposed.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.989
In Sahaja Yoga you get exposed.

27:24.573 --> 27:29.656
So one must know that though this power is so helpful,

27:30.072 --> 27:37.989
so guiding, so improving and nourishing and protecting,

27:38.364 --> 27:40.989
still - up to a point.

27:41.239 --> 27:44.322
Otherwise it is She only who exposes you,

27:47.698 --> 27:52.072
because She can't bear any more this nonsense from you.

27:53.864 --> 27:55.322
So if you go on like that,

27:55.322 --> 27:57.448
She'll just see to it that She is exposed.

27:57.738 --> 27:59.072
You have seen people have been doing

27:59.072 --> 28:00.531
all kinds of filthy things.

28:00.531 --> 28:02.947
I have known many prime ministers

28:03.197 --> 28:05.947
and all these presidents and this and that,

28:05.947 --> 28:08.738
when they die - exposed.

28:14.197 --> 28:17.739
Nobody says that such and such person was a chaste person.

28:18.614 --> 28:22.656
Very few leaders of nations have got this certificate

28:22.947 --> 28:25.030
that they were very chaste people.

28:25.406 --> 28:28.738
Chastity is a very, very rare certificate they get.

28:28.947 --> 28:32.947
Because once you get a power in life

28:33.739 --> 28:36.197
then you think you have a free hand,

28:36.489 --> 28:38.947
you can be and you can do what you like.

28:39.197 --> 28:41.738
You can be a chaste person,

28:41.947 --> 28:44.656
you can be any way unchaste,

28:44.905 --> 28:46.156
you can do what you like.

28:46.531 --> 28:50.656
You become sort of overpowered with this idea that

28:50.656 --> 28:54.281
"I have got all the powers, now I am very well placed."

28:54.656 --> 29:00.156
And that becomes a complete delusion for you,

29:00.406 --> 29:03.072
and you forget that chastity is so important.

29:03.072 --> 29:06.156
So the higher a person is placed in life,

29:06.406 --> 29:08.322
the higher positions he occupies,

29:08.614 --> 29:17.822
the higher what you call the ego-pampering stuff he gets,

29:18.072 --> 29:22.281
the more he presses down on the left Vishuddhi.

29:22.738 --> 29:25.822
So such a person escapes into the left Vishuddhi,

29:26.072 --> 29:28.489
because in his heart of hearts,

29:28.489 --> 29:30.739
in his unconscious he feels guilty.

29:31.030 --> 29:34.738
And the whole thing goes as a guilt,

29:35.281 --> 29:37.156
guilt in the left Vishuddhi.

29:37.531 --> 29:40.739
And when it goes as a guilt in the left Vishuddhi

29:41.072 --> 29:42.738
then it's a difficult situation,

29:42.947 --> 29:44.364
because such a person,

29:44.739 --> 29:46.489
he becomes extremely sensitive.

29:46.738 --> 29:49.406
You say anything to that person, he feels more guilty.

29:49.905 --> 29:52.531
You try to cure his left Vishuddhi,

29:52.531 --> 29:54.822
then he becomes even worse.

29:55.281 --> 29:58.197
It's a very bad situation with left Vishuddhi people,

29:58.531 --> 30:01.947
and they are the people who have left Vishuddhi

30:02.197 --> 30:03.656
always give explanations.

30:04.698 --> 30:07.406
A person who has right Vishuddhi will be arrogant,

30:07.698 --> 30:10.905
but left Vishuddhi people have a very sly method

30:10.905 --> 30:15.114
of giving answers back and explanation for everything.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.239
Whatever You say, they will say,

30:16.239 --> 30:18.364
"No, Mother, this is this, this is this."

30:18.364 --> 30:21.989
This is one thing. Not only, it doesn't end there,

30:22.364 --> 30:24.030
it gives you sarcasm.

30:24.738 --> 30:28.239
That's why in the West people never talk straightforward,

30:28.239 --> 30:29.822
it's always sarcastic.

30:30.406 --> 30:33.030
To talk straightforward means they think it's stupid,

30:33.573 --> 30:34.698
is unintelligent,

30:34.989 --> 30:38.364
if unless and until you talk in a very sarcastic manner

30:38.698 --> 30:41.573
which sometimes, you know, it's difficult to reach.

30:44.030 --> 30:47.030
That's how in a very crooked way they talk.

30:47.489 --> 30:52.281
And that crookery comes through this left Vishuddhi problem.

30:52.281 --> 30:54.239
If your left Vishuddhi is so bad,

30:54.489 --> 30:59.905
you cannot achieve anything that is sweet,

31:00.406 --> 31:01.822
that is beautiful,

31:03.364 --> 31:05.030
that's appreciative.

31:06.614 --> 31:09.573
Left Vishuddhi will never appreciate.

31:09.989 --> 31:11.573
Those who suffer from left Vishuddhi

31:11.573 --> 31:13.989
can never appreciate another person, can never.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.989
It will have its own say, it will think, "I'm the best"

31:17.239 --> 31:19.281
because it has to exist,

31:19.780 --> 31:22.239
that problem has to exist, so how?

31:22.239 --> 31:25.114
It's a kind of a perverted ego

31:25.489 --> 31:26.822
that doesn't want to accept

31:26.822 --> 31:28.448
that anybody can be better than me,

31:28.448 --> 31:30.156
that anybody I have to follow,

31:30.406 --> 31:33.156
that I have to take some lessons from another one.

31:33.489 --> 31:34.738
I've had many examples;

31:34.738 --> 31:36.698
I see specially people who are with Me,

31:36.698 --> 31:39.989
I find they get into left Vishuddhi very fast

31:40.698 --> 31:43.614
because they lack in protocol.

31:43.614 --> 31:45.614
Once they start lacking in protocol

31:45.614 --> 31:47.989
they go into left Vishuddhi.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.573
So to be with Me is a blessing, no doubt,

31:50.822 --> 31:54.656
but also one has to be very, very careful

31:54.864 --> 31:57.406
that you do not cross the protocols.

31:57.739 --> 32:00.656
Do not try to come over-forward,

32:01.197 --> 32:02.947
just prancing.

32:03.489 --> 32:07.989
Some people have a habit of crossing the limits,

32:07.989 --> 32:09.698
and as soon as you cross the limits

32:09.698 --> 32:11.739
left Vishuddhi is created.

32:12.239 --> 32:15.114
There should be awe for your Mother,

32:15.364 --> 32:17.030
there should be respect for your Mother,

32:17.030 --> 32:20.780
which is guarded by left Vishuddhi.

32:21.989 --> 32:26.239
Now this is a very hidden power of Shri Ganesha.

32:26.489 --> 32:29.573
What you call is the power of Ganesha

32:29.573 --> 32:35.156
is left Vishuddhi acting like chastity.

32:38.030 --> 32:44.489
Ganesha's power are all expressed through left Vishuddhi.

32:46.322 --> 32:49.197
So those who believe in Ganesha, in pure innocence,

32:49.197 --> 32:52.030
must know that in your everyday-to-day behavior,

32:52.322 --> 32:55.573
in everyday-to-day action,

32:56.322 --> 32:57.780
there should be chastity.

32:58.114 --> 33:02.614
Ganesha is expressed as flowers of chastity.

33:03.489 --> 33:07.364
And just see, in the divine law if there's no chastity,

33:07.364 --> 33:09.114
how do you delimit people,

33:09.114 --> 33:11.448
how do you make all right,

33:11.698 --> 33:13.614
how do you cleanse them,

33:13.905 --> 33:15.864
how do you make them evolve?

33:16.197 --> 33:20.656
Supposing a tree is growing and there's no limit in it,

33:20.864 --> 33:23.239
it just grows like a wild thing,

33:23.239 --> 33:24.573
it has no limits,

33:24.573 --> 33:26.114
then what will you get out of it?

33:26.114 --> 33:27.322
Nothing.

33:27.573 --> 33:31.114
So to make a person higher and higher,

33:31.114 --> 33:32.780
you have to limit it.

33:33.364 --> 33:35.905
My father used to give a very good example of this,

33:35.905 --> 33:39.197
that if you take some wheat, the wheat & .

33:39.656 --> 33:41.197
(You please now don't disturb.

33:41.197 --> 33:43.197
If you want to go out you can go out,

33:43.448 --> 33:47.030
but don't disturb the people, anybody moving about.)

33:49.573 --> 33:51.489
This is also another thing is, you see.

33:51.739 --> 33:54.489
All these things are nothing but

33:54.489 --> 33:56.780
the upheaval of the left Vishuddhi.

33:57.322 --> 34:02.281
See, all this show-off or disturbing

34:02.738 --> 34:05.281
or trying to be overpowering,

34:05.864 --> 34:08.822
or very forward person or bumptiousness,

34:08.822 --> 34:11.197
all these come from left Vishuddhi,

34:11.197 --> 34:13.573
because you want to overcome your left Vishuddhi

34:13.573 --> 34:15.114
so you do it.

34:16.072 --> 34:18.114
And then this is added to it.

34:18.406 --> 34:21.739
The more you try to overcome it, the more it is added to it.

34:22.030 --> 34:25.364
Now the father's story I must tell you,

34:25.364 --> 34:26.780
that he said that

34:26.780 --> 34:30.905
you have got the wheat and if you spread it,

34:30.905 --> 34:33.448
it just fritters away like attention does.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.780
But if you put in a gunny bag,

34:37.364 --> 34:38.364
in a bag,

34:38.780 --> 34:43.614
you can heap it up and it can achieve a height.

34:44.406 --> 34:45.614
In the same way,

34:45.822 --> 34:48.905
if you fritter away your attention without chastity,

34:49.156 --> 34:50.738
it spreads out;

34:51.656 --> 34:54.573
it has no limits, it has no forms,

34:54.573 --> 34:55.989
it had no shape.

34:56.239 --> 34:57.656
But if you delimit it,

34:58.573 --> 35:02.780
then you become higher and higher and higher,

35:03.072 --> 35:07.364
and you can rise higher in your spiritual life.

35:07.864 --> 35:12.448
As you are the people who want to lead a very spiritual life,

35:12.698 --> 35:19.573
you must understand that left Vishuddhi is to be corrected.

35:20.489 --> 35:24.531
Now, how do you correct your left Vishuddhi?

35:25.448 --> 35:27.614
I get sometimes very tired with them,

35:27.614 --> 35:29.864
really to be - I get very,

35:30.156 --> 35:32.114
I just give them up.

35:32.738 --> 35:34.573
Because if they are catching

35:34.573 --> 35:36.030
and you tell them "You are catching"

35:36.322 --> 35:38.738
they become even worse. What a vicious circle it is.

35:39.114 --> 35:40.573
What is the cure for it?

35:40.656 --> 35:44.739
How to break the vicious circle? - is by facing it.

35:45.656 --> 35:47.864
Should say, "What, you are feeling guilty for what?

35:47.864 --> 35:49.739
You're doing the same mistake again and again,

35:49.739 --> 35:51.448
and still you're doing it."

35:51.448 --> 35:57.114
You should give all injections to yourself.

35:57.364 --> 36:00.448
But instead of that they start telling Me,

36:00.698 --> 36:03.739
"No, Mother. No, Mother. No, Mother."

36:04.239 --> 36:06.905
You tell yourself, "No, myself.

36:07.947 --> 36:10.864
I have done this today, tomorrow I'm going to do it,

36:10.864 --> 36:12.239
day after tomorrow I'm going to do it.

36:12.239 --> 36:16.531
Stop it now, stop." And stop at this point.

36:17.114 --> 36:20.531
There you exert your Vishnumaya power.

36:20.989 --> 36:24.573
Vishnumaya power has to be neutralized,

36:25.780 --> 36:29.322
if so, by your mistakes;

36:29.698 --> 36:34.739
but if it has to be brought back into its power,

36:34.989 --> 36:36.739
you must use Vishnumaya's power

36:36.739 --> 36:39.072
by giving yourself shocks.

36:42.197 --> 36:43.864
Then only you can do it.

36:43.864 --> 36:46.573
So on that point, on the Vishnumaya point

36:46.573 --> 36:48.739
I really fail you.

36:49.072 --> 36:50.947
You have to do it.

36:52.989 --> 36:56.322
And that's why I was thinking about this puja

36:56.573 --> 37:00.072
that when you people are doing this puja to Me,

37:00.698 --> 37:04.989
if I say anything it will create more Vishnumaya in you.

37:04.989 --> 37:07.739
But that's the easiest way to manage things, you see -

37:07.739 --> 37:11.947
"I am feeling guilty" - you're finished.

37:12.281 --> 37:14.739
"I have taken the punishment, I called myself guilty."

37:15.072 --> 37:18.989
It's like in the court the jury says you are guilty

37:18.989 --> 37:22.406
- all right, accept it, "I am guilty," but no punishment,

37:23.739 --> 37:24.989
take no punishment.

37:25.531 --> 37:28.322
If you have done wrong, then punish yourself.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.322
Now there are two ways people punish.

37:30.738 --> 37:33.531
One is like some people punish them

37:33.531 --> 37:36.448
by saying that "I will not have my food."

37:36.448 --> 37:39.489
But those people who have a habit of not having food

37:39.489 --> 37:42.156
and this thing, can also become aggressive

37:42.156 --> 37:44.156
with that kind of a habit to trouble others

37:44.156 --> 37:48.489
by not eating food. I mean, human beings are very crooked.

37:49.030 --> 37:50.489
They know how to kill themselves

37:50.489 --> 37:52.197
with a crooked knife all the time.

37:52.614 --> 37:54.822
So that's not the way you can correct yourself.

37:55.947 --> 37:58.072
If you have to correct yourself,

37:58.489 --> 38:02.030
then you have to face yourself in a proper way.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.905
Supposing you have done something wrong,

38:06.531 --> 38:09.656
then you should do something that

38:09.656 --> 38:11.947
you would like to do normally,

38:13.281 --> 38:14.489
and punish yourself.

38:14.489 --> 38:16.364
You should, you should, I am sorry,

38:16.364 --> 38:18.281
you should not do something

38:18.281 --> 38:20.030
that you would like to do normally.

38:20.030 --> 38:22.030
Like correcting yourself;

38:22.030 --> 38:28.406
somebody is, say, very fond of the gardens, of flowers.

38:29.030 --> 38:30.281
When you do some mistake

38:30.281 --> 38:33.072
you don't see flowers for some time,

38:35.156 --> 38:37.531
just close your eyes for flowers.

38:38.030 --> 38:40.780
Now there are some people, supposing,

38:41.030 --> 38:45.072
who are fond of singing,

38:47.030 --> 38:51.156
so if you do mistakes then just stop singing.

38:55.738 --> 38:57.698
That's how you have to shock.

38:58.614 --> 39:01.780
You must know Vishnumaya is a lightning,

39:02.156 --> 39:04.114
and the lecture has to be like that.

39:04.489 --> 39:07.738
It cannot be that soft one, as Shri Krishna was.

39:08.114 --> 39:10.489
It's a very powerful thing I'm telling you,

39:10.864 --> 39:17.614
and may God awaken that power within you of Vishnumaya.

39:17.905 --> 39:21.905
It's the most powerful thing that a human being can have,

39:22.239 --> 39:23.864
is the most auspicious thing;

39:23.864 --> 39:26.573
you become a holy personality.

39:29.448 --> 39:33.239
This is one of the ways of getting God's realization.

39:34.239 --> 39:37.364
It was a nice question aptly asked,

39:37.614 --> 39:39.156
right time yesterday,

39:39.448 --> 39:42.322
is to establish your chastity

39:43.030 --> 39:44.614
- not by giving bandhans,

39:44.614 --> 39:47.573
taking vibrations from Mother and then getting lost,

39:47.780 --> 39:50.698
not that way: you yourself correcting yourself

39:50.905 --> 39:52.573
morning till evening,

39:53.656 --> 39:56.698
and facing yourself and not feeling guilty,

39:58.364 --> 40:00.364
and learning new things.

40:00.905 --> 40:04.364
All the time is the sister who teaches you,

40:04.364 --> 40:07.614
all the time, how to be better and better and better,

40:07.614 --> 40:08.822
not the Mother;

40:09.114 --> 40:10.989
because Mother you can say, "No, Mother."

40:10.989 --> 40:14.364
To a sister if you say - electricity,

40:14.614 --> 40:15.780
all right?

40:16.322 --> 40:20.156
Try your fingers in the plug and you will know

40:21.156 --> 40:23.197
- no explanations!

40:31.072 --> 40:33.030
With this understanding,

40:33.030 --> 40:35.406
today we are going to do the puja

40:35.406 --> 40:38.156
for the establishment of our chastity,

40:38.406 --> 40:43.406
chastity of our emotions and chastity of our mind.

40:44.156 --> 40:45.739
Now whatever you have done so far,

40:45.739 --> 40:47.489
forget it, forget the past.

40:47.738 --> 40:50.738
That is very important also to forget the past,

40:50.947 --> 40:52.905
because you see that's a very good way of explaining,

40:52.905 --> 40:55.406
"Because I had this, that's why it has happened.

40:55.406 --> 40:58.156
My mother was like this, that, and my father was like this

40:58.531 --> 41:01.489
"Mother, father, everybody you forget now,

41:01.489 --> 41:04.614
you belong to this family, which is a holy family.

41:05.156 --> 41:08.531
People who are saints

41:09.947 --> 41:13.322
sitting here, among them you are.

41:14.156 --> 41:17.822
And automatically these laws will start working,

41:17.822 --> 41:19.614
and I will not have to tell you

41:19.822 --> 41:21.531
whether you be friendly with that person

41:21.531 --> 41:24.072
or not friendly with that person.

41:26.614 --> 41:29.656
You see, interest in another sex

41:30.030 --> 41:34.364
all the time is not a sign of chastity.

41:35.739 --> 41:40.030
I mean, it's horrid, absolutely ridiculous,

41:40.281 --> 41:42.072
you become stupid.

41:42.739 --> 41:45.614
Like some men know so much about what women use,

41:45.822 --> 41:47.738
perfumes, this, that. What's the use?

41:47.738 --> 41:50.197
Are you slaves of women, or what?

41:50.738 --> 41:53.531
They become experts on this nonsensical thing.

41:55.322 --> 41:57.448
You are men, live like men.

41:59.531 --> 42:02.738
And women have to have that sense of chastity

42:02.738 --> 42:05.448
within themselves, because they're the powers.

42:06.322 --> 42:09.156
Why are you wanting to become like men?

42:09.531 --> 42:11.614
I mean, you are the powers behind them.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.864
And women must look after their chastity.

42:16.197 --> 42:18.030
For that I must say,

42:18.780 --> 42:23.156
I must bow to Indian women for that,

42:24.614 --> 42:25.905
the way they are humble,

42:26.489 --> 42:28.030
the way they are chaste,

42:28.030 --> 42:30.281
one has to learn - of course there are many

42:30.281 --> 42:33.738
who are not also - but the humility that they have.

42:35.531 --> 42:40.738
There's only one category which should not have humility:

42:42.072 --> 42:45.822
that is the incarnations.

42:46.738 --> 42:50.489
I cannot have humility, sorry to say.

42:50.905 --> 42:52.822
There are certain qualities you can have

42:52.822 --> 42:54.698
and enjoy and cherish, I cannot have.

42:54.905 --> 43:00.698
I cannot humble down Myself, cannot do it, I'm sorry

43:03.114 --> 43:05.156
- I'm not supposed to do it.

43:05.947 --> 43:08.364
No incarnation was humble;

43:08.614 --> 43:10.030
they cannot,

43:11.364 --> 43:13.947
because they have no guilt.

43:20.698 --> 43:24.156
I have put so many guilty people in My left Vishuddhi

43:24.531 --> 43:28.281
that My ears are getting blocked trying to clear them out.

43:28.531 --> 43:30.156
If you can clear out your guilt

43:30.406 --> 43:33.614
My ears will be opened out, My trouble will go away.

43:33.614 --> 43:35.030
So please, I request you

43:35.281 --> 43:37.406
to keep your left Vishuddhi all right.

43:37.406 --> 43:40.364
Don't feel guilty, be in the center.

43:41.030 --> 43:44.281
Be in the center, watch yourself and face yourself,

43:44.531 --> 43:46.406
shock yourself, correct yourself.

43:46.406 --> 43:49.614
Only such people will ascend.

43:51.239 --> 43:53.947
Another way is meditation.

43:54.281 --> 43:55.989
With your left hand towards the photograph,

43:55.989 --> 43:58.905
with the light there, right hand on the Mother Earth,

43:59.698 --> 44:00.780
you can work it out.

44:00.780 --> 44:02.322
Put the light over here,

44:02.322 --> 44:04.156
give a bandhan to your left Vishuddhi,

44:04.156 --> 44:05.114
you can work it out.

44:05.114 --> 44:08.780
But these become rituals if you do not do it from your heart.

44:09.114 --> 44:12.780
So first of all face it, mentally face it fully,

44:12.780 --> 44:14.489
then do it with these things.

44:14.489 --> 44:16.614
Emotionally understand it also,

44:16.905 --> 44:21.156
that the emotions you have should have no guilt in it.

44:23.030 --> 44:25.156
So for all our practical purposes

44:25.448 --> 44:29.698
we are not to use all such words which shows our guilt

44:29.989 --> 44:31.156
- but humility.

44:31.614 --> 44:34.905
Humility is very different from a guilty person.

44:35.156 --> 44:38.989
Guilty person is the person who is under duress,

44:39.322 --> 44:43.364
under pressure, but a humble person is a free person.

44:44.322 --> 44:48.239
He is humble in his own freedom, in his own exuberance.

44:48.322 --> 44:50.614
Like the trees, when they are loaded with fruit

44:50.614 --> 44:54.531
they just bow to the Mother Earth.

44:55.531 --> 44:58.072
Like, if you go to the sea,

44:58.072 --> 45:02.448
you'll find that all the trees around the sea,

45:02.738 --> 45:05.406
specially the coconut trees,

45:05.406 --> 45:08.030
all bend towards the sea

45:08.947 --> 45:11.822
because the sea has given them that speciality.

45:11.822 --> 45:15.656
The water that is in the coconut comes from the sea.

45:15.656 --> 45:20.656
So all of them have that respect,

45:20.947 --> 45:23.656
that humility towards the sea.

45:23.947 --> 45:30.197
In the same way a person who is not guilty

45:30.738 --> 45:33.406
only will be really humble,

45:33.656 --> 45:35.406
because guilty people, as I told you,

45:35.656 --> 45:39.614
are aggressive by their sarcasm, by their nasty words,

45:39.614 --> 45:42.448
by their answering back, by their explanations.

45:42.739 --> 45:49.531
But a humble person is a free person,

45:49.947 --> 45:51.656
free to be humble,

45:52.072 --> 45:55.072
free to be kindly,

45:55.531 --> 45:57.739
to be gentle, to be compassionate.

45:58.030 --> 46:02.531
And that sort of Sahaja yogis you have to be,

46:02.822 --> 46:04.489
so that when people meet you

46:04.489 --> 46:06.072
they're impressed by your humility.

46:06.322 --> 46:10.448
But humility doesn't have any subservience

46:10.822 --> 46:13.656
- innocence and humility.

46:15.281 --> 46:18.738
I, I lack that quality completely.

46:19.072 --> 46:20.531
I cannot be humble,

46:20.864 --> 46:23.030
and you should never try to humble Me down

46:23.030 --> 46:25.072
because that is not to be done.

46:25.739 --> 46:31.239
But nobody can say in My behavior when they meet Me

46:31.239 --> 46:33.114
that I'm not humble.

46:33.489 --> 46:36.698
I act as a very humble person.

46:37.448 --> 46:41.364
I can act as a very humble person but to be very frank,

46:41.614 --> 46:45.489
I have no humility of any kind within Me, no humility.

46:45.739 --> 46:49.030
Compassion is very different from humility.

46:49.364 --> 46:52.239
Humility is a human quality,

46:52.573 --> 46:56.448
is a special quality only the bhaktas have.

46:57.030 --> 47:00.614
Only the bhaktas have, it's such a beautiful quality

47:01.239 --> 47:04.573
of taking the showers of bliss.

47:05.573 --> 47:08.698
The one who gives bliss cannot be humble

47:08.698 --> 47:10.780
because it cannot take anything.

47:11.030 --> 47:14.864
It's the only human beings who are humble,

47:15.114 --> 47:18.614
and who can take it and achieve it and receive it.

47:18.864 --> 47:24.905
And the person who cannot take is so lonely, so lonely.

47:25.448 --> 47:30.614
Such a person cannot get companionship with anyone,

47:30.989 --> 47:33.489
because it has to give, and give, and give.

47:33.489 --> 47:40.030
It's so lonely, and has to face everything oneself.

47:40.322 --> 47:44.030
Those who are humble can only become friendly

47:44.030 --> 47:48.489
with each other, can share their problems with each other.

47:48.739 --> 47:52.780
I cannot, because you have no solutions.

47:53.489 --> 47:55.698
I have to solve My own problem.

47:55.989 --> 48:01.030
So the humility can only help you to articulate

48:01.322 --> 48:03.322
and to have rapport with your friends,

48:03.573 --> 48:06.239
everyone, share your difficulties.

48:06.573 --> 48:09.322
But again I have to warn you because it always happens,

48:09.614 --> 48:12.780
your humility should not be sympathetic.

48:14.364 --> 48:16.905
Humility is a detached person,

48:16.905 --> 48:19.114
it's a detached quality.

48:19.364 --> 48:22.239
It's not a quality that gets attached

48:22.239 --> 48:24.239
to one person or second person.

48:24.989 --> 48:27.156
It's a humble style of life

48:27.156 --> 48:29.448
where you are not arrogant unnecessarily,

48:29.698 --> 48:31.448
you don't shout at people.

48:31.739 --> 48:35.364
But in India we say the cow

48:35.698 --> 48:37.322
is a very humble animal.

48:37.573 --> 48:39.364
It gives its milk,

48:40.114 --> 48:42.072
it provides everything,

48:42.322 --> 48:44.239
it doesn't attack anyone.

48:46.072 --> 48:49.322
So humility is such a guard for you.

48:50.030 --> 48:52.531
Of course, sometimes people take advantage of humble people,

48:52.739 --> 48:53.364
doesn't matter.

48:53.364 --> 48:55.947
As long as you have not lost your humility,

48:56.197 --> 48:57.072
everything is all right.

48:57.406 --> 48:58.905
But people lose their humility.

48:58.905 --> 49:00.406
When people try to trouble them

49:00.406 --> 49:01.947
they become left-Vishuddhites

49:01.947 --> 49:05.156
and then they lose their humility,

49:05.531 --> 49:07.656
and that's one thing one should not lose;

49:08.156 --> 49:12.030
because if you have to keep connection with the Divine

49:12.364 --> 49:14.614
then you have to be humble.

49:14.947 --> 49:16.656
There's no other way.

49:17.156 --> 49:19.281
If you are not a humble person

49:19.780 --> 49:21.614
you cannot keep the relationship.

49:21.947 --> 49:25.738
See, two qualities, like a plug and the socket.

49:26.030 --> 49:27.905
The plug has to be the plug,

49:28.156 --> 49:30.197
the socket has to be socket.

49:30.197 --> 49:32.197
In the same way if you have to

49:32.489 --> 49:35.072
get something out of the Divine,

49:35.072 --> 49:36.905
you have to be humble people.

49:36.905 --> 49:39.947
Through arrogance you will not get anything,

49:40.364 --> 49:43.156
through aggression you'll not get anything,

49:43.738 --> 49:46.030
through anything .& Some people also feel that

49:46.030 --> 49:49.406
"I love Mother," but that love is to be expressed

49:49.656 --> 49:51.656
through complete humility.

49:53.738 --> 49:55.614
That's the only way,

49:55.905 --> 49:59.822
that's the only channel through which you can approach Me,

50:00.072 --> 50:01.905
there's no way out.

50:03.489 --> 50:11.406
So we end up today on a very high stage.

50:12.656 --> 50:15.156
It's the beginning of God's realization.

50:15.489 --> 50:17.614
But you must speed up with Me.

50:18.030 --> 50:20.072
It's not easy to keep speed with Me,

50:20.531 --> 50:22.364
so you have to speed up with Me.

50:22.364 --> 50:24.489
If you have to go towards God's realization,

50:24.780 --> 50:30.531
first establish your sense of chastity and humility.

50:34.656 --> 50:36.738
May God bless you.
