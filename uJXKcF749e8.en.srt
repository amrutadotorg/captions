1
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:50,673
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna within us.

2
00:04:55,775 --> 00:05:04,666
As you know, that you all have been seeking
 before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

3
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:22,997
You went to different places, read lots of
books, and also some of you were lost.

4
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:30,838
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know
what you were seeking.

5
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:39,217
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

6
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,192
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

7
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,203
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

8
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:54,171
This is one point which is absolutely there
in every religion, “Know thyself” –

9
00:05:54,338 --> 00:06:00,097
 because without knowing yourself you will not know God.

10
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,743
You will not know spirituality.

11
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:07,100
So the first step was to know yourself,

12
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:13,459
 and that one people did all kinds of tricks with you,
they taught you in a different ways

13
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:20,501
and tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

14
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:23,567
All those things have happened, is finished.

15
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:31,730
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get
your Self-realization.

16
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:44,941
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization
is to know God, or the Goddess;

17
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:50,558
that is the purpose of Self-realization.

18
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:59,016
But after getting Self-realization, what should
happen to you?

19
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:07,613
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical
things like drugs and all those things;

20
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:15,487
you have lost interest in reading also useless
books; you have lost interest

21
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:19,079
 in other habits like drinking and all that.

22
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:23,509
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

23
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,791
That would happen in anyway.

24
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:34,506
What has to happen by knowing God, is that
why does God wants you to know Him?

25
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:39,738
Because He wants to see His reflection in you.

26
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:46,170
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why
He has created you, and He wants to see His

27
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,450
reflection in you.

28
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,239
Same with the Goddess.

29
00:07:49,239 --> 00:08:00,439
She has given you Self-realization because
She wants to see Her reflection in you.

30
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:18,289
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving,

31
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:27,429
compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

32
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:35,239
So this is the point one has to reach, where
you understand you have to have wisdom.

33
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:41,200
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are
not a self-realized person.

34
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:50,510
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He
wants you to become one part and parcel of

35
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,950
the Virata – or the Viratangana, also wants
the same thing, that you should become part

36
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,700
and parcel of the Virata.

37
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,870
Not because you are realized souls now, so
you go about thinking you are perfectly all

38
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,320
right, you don’t have to do anything about
it.

39
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:24,140
What do you do beyond this is the point, that
after Self-realization you have to see the

40
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:37,281
reflection that should be within you from
the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

41
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:49,090
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult
situation, as you know, and He was carried

42
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:55,420
from there to Gokul, where He was brought
up by Yeshoda.

43
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:04,070
Now there He started His playfulness.

44
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:11,650
So you have to be playful in life, you have
to create fun and joy.

45
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:20,730
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old
sage somewhere in the Himalayas, but you mix

46
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:28,120
up with children, you talk to them, you play
with them, have fun.

47
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:35,410
At the same time He was destroying negative
forces which acted upon Him.

48
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,870
In His playfulness only He has done it, as
a child only He has done it.

49
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,960
How matured He was as a child you can see,
that He killed the Putana, and there are two

50
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,861
horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

51
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:57,283
At the same time He was playing with the gopis

52
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:03,444
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun of them.

53
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,967
Why?

54
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:16,962
Because He wanted them to be playful; and
all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

55
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:26,510
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted
the complete mountain on His fingertips.

56
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:32,680
That time these people should have understood,
it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

57
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:42,820
But He was just standing there with the one
finger at the mountain in a very simple, unassuming

58
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:51,080
manner; He was doing all that to protect all
the boys who were playing with Him.

59
00:11:51,080 --> 00:12:00,830
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who
was a big snake in the water.

60
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:08,840
In the water this horrible fellow was creating
venom, and by which many people were killed.

61
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:22,430
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that
horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

62
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:32,210
in a way all the people by killing or hitting,
or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

63
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,297
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked Him

64
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:42,686
that “Please forgive him,” and He forgave.

65
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:51,310
All these things show a child of six, seven
years doing all these great things without

66
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:58,190
feeling what He was doing, we can say that
without even thinking about it.

67
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:05,030
But He achieved it, because He was aware that
He was Shri Krishna.

68
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:11,060
So first thing, you have to be aware that
you are self-realized people.

69
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:20,799
You are not ordinary people to behave in an
ordinary way, you are special people made

70
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:27,780
specially to reflect the qualities of God
Almighty.

71
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:33,729
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

72
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:41,430
But the situation is such today that you are
all the time protected.

73
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,539
You are all the time protected.

74
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:49,570
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,

75
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:56,899
and you can be looked after 
because you are Sahaja yogis.

76
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:04,708
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja yogi

77
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:09,255
towards taking decisions, one should understand.

78
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:18,189
It should be a spontaneous decision.

79
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:23,900
You don’t have to tally it with this, go
there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

80
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:31,270
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

81
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,540
So in the same way you should have a very
spontaneous decision for anything.

82
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,739
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

83
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:40,739
All right.

84
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:46,999
You go in the shop and immediately you should
know which is the one.

85
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:54,239
In every walk of life you should have a very
spontaneous decision, instant decision.

86
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:59,700
But what I find, the style is very different.

87
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:07,739
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make
a list of it, then make all the measurements,

88
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:13,119
then go home and say that “We’ll decide
it tomorrow.”

89
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:18,020
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

90
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,405
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely
spontaneously, at that moment.

91
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:33,096
You should be like this: now somebody is getting drowned,

92
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:37,964
so the first impulse should be that you have to save.

93
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,040
And how do you save?

94
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:48,979
You jump in the water – because you are
protected, nothing can happen to you,

95
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:53,323
so just jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

96
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,739
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude,
this should be your temperament, that you

97
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:03,900
take a very spontaneous decision.

98
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:14,929
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,
and having a big conference for decisions

99
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:19,109
and all that – not needed.

100
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:28,239
In day-to-day life also you have to be like
that.

101
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:36,559
Also in every political life, economic life
or any other life you have to lead, you have

102
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,960
to be very spontaneous.

103
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,380
How do you become spontaneous?

104
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
What quality you have got?

105
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:55,229
What is the weapon you have got, to know what
decision to take?

106
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:58,339
Do you know?

107
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:04,299
You have got vibrations, you have the feel of the vibrations,

108
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:08,210
and you know what vibrations are.

109
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,729
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey
and communicate to you.

110
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:16,169
They speak to you.

111
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:25,299
So through your vibrations you should know
in a second what should you do.

112
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:31,140
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother,
when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

113
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,130
It’s a fact.

114
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,210
But how many of you feel that way?

115
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,150
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

116
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,739
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

117
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:55,289
You should know looking at anyone, sitting
next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

118
00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:03,090
you should know what sort of vibrations that
person has.

119
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,010
This kind of sensitivity if you develop,

120
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:10,200
 then you will definitely take a very spontaneous decision.

121
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,689
You know I am very good at it.

122
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:22,439
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really
five minutes.

123
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:28,049
When I came here they said, “You can’t
go up, because You have big car.”

124
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,840
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along,
I’ll take You in my car.”

125
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,770
So I went with him on the car, on that car,
and I saw it.

126
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,219
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

127
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:49,549
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right,
and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

128
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:54,710
And everybody who was with Me, they said,
“Ah, what a place, Mother!

129
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,290
You can’t buy that.”

130
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,149
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

131
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:01,200
“When?”

132
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,249
“Today.

133
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,299
Now!”

134
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,299
He was amazed.

135
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:07,929
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

136
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,729
He said, “Very easy.

137
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:17,649
In this Italy You have to buy like this, that
You pay one-third of the price, all right?

138
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,939
And then You can occupy.

139
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:25,790
If You find something wrong with the place
You can give up, but then You’ll not get

140
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,790
Your money.

141
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,999
But if the other fellow who is selling You
says no, then he has to pay double.”

142
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:33,149
I said, “Very good bargain.

143
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,149
I am buying.

144
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:35,489
I have told you I am buying.

145
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,570
I’ll buy.”

146
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,849
And everybody was surprised what Mother was
doing.

147
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:46,470
So what decided was the vibrations.

148
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,760
Vibrations of the place just decided.

149
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,049
I said, “Buy it.”

150
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:56,119
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles;
I said no.

151
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,670
Outside only I could say no, and they were
surprised I didn’t even go inside.

152
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,599
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

153
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,869
They said, “Nunnery.”

154
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:09,140
I said, “See?”

155
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,409
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous
decision.

156
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:25,890
Then you will be amazed how in such a short
time you can really achieve such great things.

157
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,575
But that doesn’t mean that you all should do that way;

158
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
first you should have that sensitivity of vibrations.

159
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,553
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,

160
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:44,651
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja Yoga.

161
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:47,972
So the maturity has to be brought in.

162
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:54,470
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right,
I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

163
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,570
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

164
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,709
So now, how do you know?

165
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:13,479
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,
you find that you have got nothing, it’s

166
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,439
all nonsense – possible.

167
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:24,159
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if

168
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:35,510
they are wrong, if there are some mistakes
or that will make you suffer, whether economically,

169
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:45,120
politically, in every way, then your whole
value system will be judged very well how

170
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:57,330
far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far
you have achieved your Self-realization, and

171
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:03,520
where are you.

172
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,240
This is what is the way to test yourself.

173
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:15,090
You should not be afraid of failures, and
not get enamored by success, because you are

174
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,620
self-realized souls.

175
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:24,020
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately
you will know what is it.

176
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,877
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that

177
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:31,770
you could have the same as I have, but you should try it.

178
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:39,610
Now, I have seen some people will praise some
man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

179
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,260
You must meet him.

180
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:48,860
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such
a help, and this will happen and that will

181
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,860
happen.”

182
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,140
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

183
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,910
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet
him.”

184
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,730
They can’t understand.

185
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,430
“Such a great man, he’ll be a minister
tomorrow.”

186
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,480
“I don’t want to meet him.”

187
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,790
And you find immediately, just next day, a
big report about him in the newspaper that

188
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,820
he’s a very bad man.

189
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:30,760
So you must tally your experience and your
understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

190
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,000
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous
decisions.

191
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,560
Don’t think about it how it should work
out, what should we do.

192
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:57,580
It has a very far-fetched influence on your
mind also that you see, that you know what

193
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,290
is right and what is wrong.

194
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,930
I don’t know how many of you have seen the
house I have built.

195
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:12,610
The another side of Shri Krishna was that
He was extremely creative.

196
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:20,120
In His childhood He did all these things,
these pranks, and when He became a grown-up

197
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,740
person He became the king of Dwarika, of that
area.

198
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,040
And He used to dress up like a king only – after
all, He was a king.

199
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:41,520
When He was a child He used to wear a small
little piece of a feather from the peacock,

200
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,760
but when He became the king He was wearing
all the things, and He used to sit on the

201
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,680
throne and talk to people in that manner.

202
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,400
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely
creative.

203
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:09,420
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful
castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

204
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,460
out of gold – can you believe it?

205
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,080
Shri Krishna did it.

206
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,170
And it was all then covered with water.

207
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:25,470
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained
by Western people I think, said that it’s

208
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:32,740
not possible, there’s nothing in the water
and He never built His palace there; it’s

209
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:40,320
all a story just, just like a myth.

210
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,530
But some people believed in it, and they dug
up.

211
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:49,370
They went down and they found there was a
very big palace.

212
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,510
There was gold little bit left, but not all
of it was there.

213
00:25:53,510 --> 00:26:00,950
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace
He had made.

214
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,440
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

215
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:14,340
Like this, all these incarnations who came
were extremely creative.

216
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,060
If you are not creative, what’s the use
of Self-realization?

217
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:25,180
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you
can do very easily is

218
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:29,378
to make others Sahaja yogis.

219
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:42,240
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing,
is to make others Sahaja yogis and give them

220
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:50,930
the blessings of the Divine, which they have
been seeking for ages.

221
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:58,270
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace,
what a blessing you give.

222
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:05,841
So now when you have got your Self-realization
– you got it very easily, I must say; they

223
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:16,110
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja
Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true – but

224
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:23,570
whatever you get so easily and instantly,
you don’t understand the value of that.

225
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,280
They always say for India that they got their
freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that

226
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,780
easily, that’s why they do not value it.

227
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:43,590
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly
and without any special effort, then you don’t

228
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,650
value it, you don’t understand.

229
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,170
You think it’s a matter of right.

230
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,720
But do you know how much people have suffered
for getting Self-realization?

231
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,680
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on
one leg, sometimes on their heads for months

232
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,170
together, and they didn’t get realization.

233
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:14,760
I have heard of some people who lived in a
room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

234
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,090
And why they lived like that?

235
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:25,800
Because they thought by keeping away from
other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

236
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,520
they might get realization.

237
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,840
They never got it.

238
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,847
So one must understand, though you have got
it very easily,

239
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:42,800
 it’s something so precious, so great.

240
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:48,300
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

241
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:58,430
You read about the people who are self-realized.

242
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:03,310
Perhaps they did not even know how they got
it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

243
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:09,770
but they got it, through their guru maybe,
maybe their efforts.

244
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:18,150
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He
gets His realization – think of Him, how

245
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,750
He got His realization.

246
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:30,820
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately
dies of hunger and poverty.

247
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,970
But nothing happened to you.

248
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:41,370
You have got it without any difficulties,
in a very sweet manner, all of you.

249
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,450
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t
have to do anything about it.

250
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:53,080
But that doesn’t mean you should not value
it.

251
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:05,610
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth
spontaneously sprouts and gives life to the

252
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:15,130
primule which grows, can grow into a shrub
and then into a tree.

253
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:24,440
But you have to put water in, and you have
to have the care of a gardener or someone.

254
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,420
In your case, you are the one who has to do
all that.

255
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:41,510
First of all you have to put the nourishment
of compassion and love.

256
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,630
Have you got that compassion and love?

257
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,750
Do you love people?

258
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,850
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked
– “I don’t like children.”

259
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,770
I said, “You don’t like children?”

260
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,920
“No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

261
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:05,550
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

262
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,640
How can you say such a thing, you don’t
like your own children, anything?

263
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,500
First of all, for all of you I would say that
you should never say “I like” and “I

264
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,640
don’t like.”

265
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,340
These are anti-mantras.

266
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,750
“I like this” – it’s very common.

267
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,450
Who are you?

268
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,730
“I don’t like this carpet.

269
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,700
I don’t like that silver thing.”

270
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,810
Who are you?

271
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,800
Can you make one like that?

272
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:41,896
To take a decision of that kind is also shows

273
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:46,085
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s not.

274
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,852
It has come from your conditioning, that you
think you have a right to say “I don’t

275
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,060
like, I don’t want.”

276
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,060
But who are you?

277
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:04,090
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these
words, because it might hurt somebody.

278
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:12,800
You’ll never say something that will hurt
others, you’ll never do anything that will

279
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:20,970
be dangerous for others; but always you’ll
say something that would be extremely loving

280
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,170
and compassionate, and peace-giving.

281
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:30,770
You will emit joy for others.

282
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:39,190
There is the power of spirit, that it gives
joy to others.

283
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,870
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then
you are not self-realized.

284
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:51,004
You should be able to give joy and love and compassion,

285
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:57,305
and it should happen absolutely spontaneously.

286
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:11,120
There’s a story about a saint in India,
in Maharashtra.

287
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:20,450
So they all used to take water in a container
called as kanwar, and would take it all the

288
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:25,780
way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

289
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:33,120
That was regarded as a great, you can say,
surrendering to Shri Krishna.

290
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,730
So that saint also carried water in that container,
this kanwar.

291
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:49,810
All the way he carried it from his village
in Maharashtra, and when he reached the temple,

292
00:33:49,810 --> 00:34:03,660
at the foot of that temple he saw a donkey
very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

293
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:10,430
So he gave that water to that donkey.

294
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:14,620
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this
water for miles together, for days together

295
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:22,890
to be put on the deity here, and now you have
given it to this donkey.”

296
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:32,030
He said, “You don’t know, God has come
all the way down here to take the water.”

297
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,510
See the attitude that he took.

298
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:46,780
So for a self-realized person the compassion
should be like that, of very generous nature.

299
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:54,080
If you are not generous, if you are miserly,
always worried about your money and saving

300
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:02,860
of it, then firstly you are not a matured
Sahaja yogi – you are not.

301
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:09,280
Apart from that, this kind of money will never
give you any happiness.

302
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,920
Miserliness is against spirit.

303
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,920
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

304
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:33,070
It never strives to save something, or cheat
people or steal something – is out of question;

305
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:39,110
because there is no greed left in it, there
is no greed at all.

306
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:46,760
And that is why such a person who is a realized
soul cannot be greedy,

307
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:49,915
has to be extremely generous.

308
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:59,020
I have seen many people like that who have
been extremely generous, and who have been

309
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,680
very understanding about the problems of others.

310
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,870
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems,
he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

311
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:18,540
He is there to solve the problems of others,
and not to solve his own problems and go about

312
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,820
talking about it, “This is the problem I
have.”

313
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,310
Now this is a new word that has developed
in modern times.

314
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:29,880
They never used to use the word “problem”
before, I tell you; only for geometry we used

315
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,580
this word “problem.”

316
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,670
But now it has started with a … “There’s
no problem.”

317
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:41,660
They are all in a problem, actually they are
problems, I think.

318
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:48,490
So what you have to do is to understand that
you should not give your problems to others.

319
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:55,410
You should not ask for anything, “Please
do this for me, please do that for me.”

320
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:07,930
It’s very surprising that people try to
sort of take advantage of others.

321
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:13,030
Now some people like to visit some countries,
so they will ask you, “Please call me.

322
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,791
I would love to come to your country,”

323
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:19,485
and a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right, come along.”

324
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:25,450
Now, who is failing here is the person who
asked.

325
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:33,440
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever,
because you are complete.

326
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,969
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete.

327
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:42,380
What can anybody give you?

328
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,719
All desires just disappear when you are in
complete shape.

329
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,310
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars
had come out.

330
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:55,130
I said, “As soon as the moon will come,
they’ll all disappear.”

331
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:08,850
In the same way, when you are complete, you
do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

332
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:14,540
On the contrary, you want to find out what
you can do for others.

333
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,008
You become the others, in a way that whatever

334
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:21,354
is the problem of others you take upon yourhead.

335
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,360
You jump into it.

336
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:34,530
It’s a very, very interesting growth that
should come in you.

337
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:43,410
It should happen to all of you, because you
have got your Self-realization.

338
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:50,940
You develop a kind of a personality which
only lives for others, not for oneself.

339
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,840
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere,
you can sleep anywhere.

340
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,000
You can have food, you need not have food,
whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

341
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,610
because you are so satisfied.

342
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:14,620
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for
others, give them food, do whatever you like

343
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,540
possible, you try to do.

344
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:25,940
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

345
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,790
But there are people who have only their own
problems.

346
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,870
They are not Sahaja yogis.

347
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:41,800
How can the spirit have problems?

348
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,000
How can that happen?

349
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:55,350
So just understand that you are now the spirit,
and beyond everything.

350
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:01,690
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

351
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,350
Of course you start giving realization to
people.

352
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,870
You create art.

353
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:14,655
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature and he was – well,

354
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,746
he didn’t know any language.

355
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:21,646
He was very good for mathematics, because
My mother was a mathematician, but language

356
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,430
he did not know.

357
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,081
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

358
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:31,690
But after realization he wrote such beautiful
poems.

359
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,470
Unbelievable!

360
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,690
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that,
because he didn’t know any language well.

361
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:43,200
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

362
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:52,640
So, amazingly, from where he started writing
Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

363
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,050
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do
you get this Urdu poetry?”

364
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,769
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

365
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:05,690
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells
me.”

366
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:16,072
So the creativity within you is just flowers,
and you are amazed at yourself

367
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:18,880
how this creativity has come in.

368
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:30,430
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician
becoming suddenly a poet – I mean, it’s

369
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,980
impossible situation.

370
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,700
And you have these capacities.

371
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,882
You have all these capacities that you can
become very creative,

372
00:41:40,907 --> 00:41:46,130
and you have to be creative in every way.

373
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:52,645
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the
time working out something

374
00:41:52,914 --> 00:41:55,961
 which comes out very well.

375
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:04,120
And also I don’t have that interest as normally
people have, that it should be praised by

376
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:12,340
everyone or it should be, sort of, very much
in the newspapers and everything.

377
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,990
No, no interest.

378
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:22,340
You create for creation, for the sake of creation
you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

379
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:34,000
And you become very adaptable, or you become
so congenial with all the things people say,

380
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,340
talk – all right, let them do it.

381
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:47,062
They will be offensive, or they could be also
praising you … you don’t know that they

382
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:49,703
are praising you.

383
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,890
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki
Jai!”

384
00:42:53,890 --> 00:43:03,010
– I also say, and then I forget they are
talking about Me.

385
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:10,570
Somehow you are above all that, and you are
there, and you just don’t understand why

386
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:17,470
human beings behave like that, why their behavior
is so funny.

387
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:24,450
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they
have a great desire to be leaders, or they

388
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:34,007
have a great desire to be a great organizer
of Sahaja Yoga,

389
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:36,774
to be very well-known in Sahaja Yoga.

390
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:46,672
They want to have an international fame as
a great Sahaja yogi.

391
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:52,650
But they do not think that “What creativity
I have shown?

392
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:56,550
What have I created?”

393
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:02,710
Just all these things are so common in human
beings that they always want others to praise

394
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:14,490
them, to have a very big sort of a exposure
– of what?

395
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,870
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

396
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:25,300
What is there to expose, what is there to
show off, what is there to come forward?

397
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:33,565
Even if you are at the back there is light,
you know there is light.

398
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:41,690
So you have to get out of your darkness, because
you are the light and you spread light; instead

399
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:49,429
of if you are in the darkness, what light
can you spread?

400
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:53,710
So your spirit cannot have problems.

401
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,350
It has no fear.

402
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:08,230
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom,
and that wisdom is the one sign of you being

403
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,820
a very higher personality.

404
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:19,730
As I told you, this is evolution, and when
you are transformed you are evolved.

405
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:28,490
Of a very different nature you become, and
you are to stand out.

406
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:36,610
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then
what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

407
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,050
What was Christ?

408
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,010
He was a son of a carpenter.

409
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,700
He never got education.

410
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,550
But what did He do?

411
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:55,140
He was the Spirit.

412
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:07,590
He reflected God within Him, and that’s
why He got Himself crucified also.

413
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:15,190
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get
crucified, there are all not such testing

414
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:22,290
things for you, but your value system is to
be checked.

415
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:29,210
You must find out how are you working out,
through introspection.

416
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:40,460
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr.
Sahaja yogi, how are you?

417
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,182
Are you indulging into all these things that
these people

418
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:49,253
who are not self-realized are doing?”

419
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:58,371
Just try to find out, because the growth of
Sahaja Yoga is shown in your behavior, in

420
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:05,450
your styles, on your face.

421
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:16,280
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how

422
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,740
will you get wrinkles?

423
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,450
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

424
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:29,940
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

425
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:41,611
Once in a church there was in Switzerland,
one lady came to hit Me with a Bible, and

426
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:42,630
I started laughing.

427
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:47,640
I said, “What a thing, and I have to be
hit by a Bible!” you see.

428
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:54,380
And she got such a fright that I was laughing,
and I was saying, “Look at this stupidity

429
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,860
of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

430
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:02,940
I mean, I can understand stone or anything
else, but Bible will never hit Me.

431
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:19,180
All these things have happened in your presence,
and you know about it.

432
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:24,210
There are negative forces.

433
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,730
They try to harm you.

434
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:31,070
They will harm you bodily, they will harm
you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

435
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:39,310
But when you are above this, then no one harms
you.

436
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:44,990
At least you never feel the harm, you are
not bothered about the harm.

437
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,340
But what have you created?

438
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:55,310
Today I had some ladies and some men, and
all for divorce.

439
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:01,980
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they
want to have divorces, can you imagine?

440
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,890
I was shocked.

441
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,880
And they had funny ideas that “my husband
is like my brother.”

442
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,490
I said, “Really?”

443
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:17,130
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their
heads means there’s no light of the spirit

444
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,390
in them.

445
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:27,090
If you have light of the spirit, then your
understanding is very different.

446
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:33,470
You don’t worry about yourself, you only
worry about others, and you try to find out

447
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,150
solutions for them.

448
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,260
You try to help them.

449
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:47,410
It is very easy for you.

450
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,420
What is so easy for the light to burn?

451
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,890
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

452
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,150
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

453
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:04,140
But for human beings, I can’t understand,
even after realization, after growing for

454
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:11,860
years together they are still so stupid that
they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

455
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:24,710
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill
it.

456
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,250
It cannot blow off.

457
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:32,410
This light will go off, but the light of the
spirit won’t go off.

458
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:41,970
But what is the oil that keeps it there is
your compassion, is love, care of others.

459
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:47,410
I know there are people who are very, say,
dominating, may be troublesome, what else

460
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:49,320
– but care for them.

461
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:55,220
Know that they are not like you, they are
not complete, they have problems; so you care

462
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,380
for them.

463
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:00,610
But instead of that, you start thinking that
“Why should I care for him?

464
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,710
How does he care for me?” or something.

465
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:04,570
Then you are finished.

466
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:13,920
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say
the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

467
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,840
A spiritual person’s reactions are very,
very different.

468
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:27,529
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that
He had a friend who was very poor, and he

469
00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:31,120
wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

470
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:38,140
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice
crispies, as you call them, “And that’s,

471
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,230
take for your friend.

472
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,940
You must take something for your friend.”

473
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,670
He was a little shy, you know.

474
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:53,500
And when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna
was in His palace, and the people at the door

475
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,370
said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

476
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,050
He said, “All right.

477
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:01,730
You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

478
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:08,960
He was sitting on the throne discussing something,
and He said, “Sudama has come!”

479
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:23,009
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged
him, hugged him again and again; and He said,

480
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:27,040
“Why are you standing here?”

481
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:37,770
He took him and put him on the throne that
He was supposed to, and He told His wives,

482
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,259
“Please come and wash his feet.”

483
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:44,360
And then they brought for him clothes and
all that.

484
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:54,430
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed
– see the love of Shri Krishna.

485
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:59,180
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

486
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:07,220
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine
by which it would be all right.

487
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:13,120
He tried to do whatever was possible to him
to cure those cracks.

488
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:21,830
And He asked him to sleep on His bed, and
asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t

489
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:24,170
feel hot.

490
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:32,120
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows
so beautifully.

491
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,680
Are we that compassionate?

492
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:44,910
There was no need for Him to do that; it was
no drama, nothing – but His heart!

493
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,400
He took a spontaneous decision.

494
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,860
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed
there.

495
00:53:53,860 --> 00:54:03,600
He just felt so happy that “My old friend
has come.”

496
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:19,680
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the
Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son, he

497
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,950
asked Him that “Why don’t You come and
stay in my palace?”

498
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:32,519
He said, “All right, I can come, but you
see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

499
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:37,190
Vidur was a son of a maid.

500
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:44,120
He went and had His food with Vidur.

501
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:53,190
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know
what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan

502
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,930
would have given Him such sumptuous food.

503
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:00,840
So for such people, taste and the level of
food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the

504
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:11,910
love, the respect of Vidur, who was a realized
soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

505
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:24,050
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is
a governor – I can’t understand; the spirit

506
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:29,870
is above everything else – and does not
respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something

507
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:32,180
wrong with him.

508
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:38,450
He should understand that this spiritual person
is higher than all these people who have these,

509
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:46,880
all kinds of these big names behind them.

510
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:59,570
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

511
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:09,769
had that love which was above everything else,
without expecting anything, not doing it just

512
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:13,960
to expect something from them.

513
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:24,690
It is a kind of a personality which really
reflects God’s love.

514
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,090
That reflection should come from you.

515
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:35,240
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean
that you are something higher than others,

516
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,269
but you are different.

517
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,300
You are above them.

518
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,400
You have no superiority, that’s why you
are different.

519
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,270
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

520
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:55,070
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s
why you are humble.

521
00:56:55,070 --> 00:57:04,930
There are so many things I can tell you from
the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was,

522
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,640
they call Him Yogeshwara.

523
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,570
He was a Lord of Yoga.

524
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:17,490
It is because He was Virat.

525
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:30,620
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna,
to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

526
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:36,290
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

527
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:46,730
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy
He was living in Gokul, and He never showed

528
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,410
off His powers.

529
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:57,310
His powers were within Himself, which were
expressing spontaneously.

530
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:08,060
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete
discretion.

531
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:17,101
If it does not have then this is not divine
power, this is some satanic power: because

532
00:58:17,101 --> 00:58:26,060
somebody is nice to you if you are nice to
that person, nothing doing.

533
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:34,710
Mostly we had in India people who were called
as avadhutas.

534
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:42,810
They were the realized souls who had gone
away from the society, from the multitudes,

535
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:53,170
and gone and lived in some small little place
or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

536
00:58:53,170 --> 00:59:02,080
because they thought nobody is going to understand
them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

537
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:08,630
They were singled out, one person here and
one person there.

538
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,730
What could they do?

539
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:15,660
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja
yogis together.

540
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:20,070
You have so many friends and you have so many
others with you.

541
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:26,210
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves
from the society.

542
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:32,570
They would not meet people, because if they
tried anything they would be crucified.

543
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:38,680
But not you people, because you have a society.

544
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:51,509
You have a beautiful enlightened society of
very good friends, of very good spiritual

545
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:52,670
people.

546
00:59:52,670 --> 01:00:02,110
With all this if you cannot create, then what
should I say?

547
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:14,940
You have to create something: may be art,
may be music, may be poetry, may be literature,

548
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:20,370
may be writing – whatever it is, you have
to create.

549
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:24,519
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

550
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:28,850
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

551
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:37,010
That’s the main thing you have to have,
is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

552
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:43,940
And there I can go to places, can have programs,
do everything.

553
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:52,390
But you have to show with your own example
that this is something great, how they have

554
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:58,850
achieved this state; we should achieve also
that state.

555
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:11,009
So you will be the ones who will really inspire
them, who will really make them follow you

556
01:01:11,009 --> 01:01:15,660
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

557
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:24,690
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become
complete – and you have to become.

558
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:34,210
Nothing is more important than becoming a
Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,

559
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:42,090
peace and blessings to everyone.

560
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:48,390
May God bless you.
