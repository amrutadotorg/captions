00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:19.184
Today is an important day in the northern part of the world

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:21.311
 because the Sun travels from South to North

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:25.428
not because we do it every year on the same day

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:28.864
because the Sun (UNCLEAR)

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:33.915
Why do we give so much importance to it?

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:39.902
         What is the special reason that if the Sun comes to the North

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:43.787
 why does it give us such happiness?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.516
The point is that with the help of the Sun only

00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:52.863
 all our work gets sanctified.

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:58.868
When there is no light during night, we are asleep.

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:06.646
But when the sun rises, after that only all our work starts.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.990
So, that which influences this work is the Sun.

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:24.436
And that because it comes within our domain

00:01:25.343 --> 00:01:30.439
so, we respect it too much.

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:33.895
The greatest thing is that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.742
rest of the festivals are observed on the basis of the Moon.

00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:45.271
And this is the only  festival that we observe

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.781
on the basis of the Sun.

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:54.630
In this way, in our country Surya Narayan has much reverence.

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:57.963
And people give much importance to Surya Narayan

00:01:57.988 --> 00:02:01.248
and go to Gangaji to take their bath

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:05.849
and perform many types of rituals.

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:11.054
But the most important of all is, this day.

00:02:12.837 --> 00:02:20.136
Now we have to decide, what should we do on this day?

00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:24.850
On this special day what work should we do?

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:29.607
Offer Namaskar to Surya (Sun), offer water to Surya

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:36.287
and express our gratitude towards Surya.

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:39.872
But the question is what in particular can we do?

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:44.273
Particularly what can Sahajyogis do?

00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:49.473
You know that on Agnya Chakra Sun has its seat

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:54.984
and at Agnya Chakra you think about everything.

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:59.494
So it is very important to correct our Agnya Chakra

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:04.571
because it influences the Sun.

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:10.638
So for this, the importance of Agnya is that

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:16.752
according to the planet on our Agnya

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.285
we get angry with the people because of our Agnya chakra.

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:28.235
and our relation with them gets disturbed.

00:03:28.782 --> 00:03:36.072
We get angry and we give up every type of belief.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.247
Agnya is a very important area.

00:03:40.272 --> 00:03:45.385
We should understand that it is the abode of Christ.

00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:51.089
But Christ told only one thing that we should forgive everyone.

00:03:51.847 --> 00:03:55.396
It is very important to forgive.

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:59.813
Now how to do that, many people say i have done

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:00.915
but it doesn't work.

00:04:01.594 --> 00:04:06.331
To forgive it is important to have satisfaction from inside.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.488
And one should think that whatever he had said he will pay for that.

00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:12.366
What we have to do with that?

00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:16.636
Whatever anyone had said  (Not Clear)

00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.933
Why should you interfere in this.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.539
In this way it is cheapish

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:26.266
and you forgive everyone, your Agnya Chakra will be alright.

00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:29.912
The greatest problem in our Agnya chakra

00:04:30.162 --> 00:04:37.184
which blocks our ascent, whick blocks our kundalini

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:43.549
is our Agnya and for that we must know how to forgive.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:46.217
Everytime we go on thinking

00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:48.900
what was the misery he caused, what was the mistake?

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:52.633
Instead we should think that we should forgive

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.227
We have forgiven him.

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.348
By forgiving you will be absolutely surprised

00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:01.629
that this Kundalini will move up in no time.

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:04.770
We have to raise our own Kundalini

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:08.921
and for that it is necessary for us to keep our Agnya clear

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:12.138
It is man's nature to get angry.

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:15.363
it is not God's, it is  man's nature.

00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:18.144
So anger should be avoided.

00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:22.845
as against that you should say forgive, forgive, forgive

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.430
Saying so many times, your Agnya Chakra will be clear.

00:05:27.455 --> 00:05:30.164
Blessings to all of you!
