WEBVTT

00:14.265 --> 00:22.217
(…) what is our job is to worship Mahakali
within us,

00:22.418 --> 00:27.259
because what does She do - perhaps we
are not very aware of.

00:27.460 --> 00:32.467
First and foremost thing She does is
to protect us.

00:32.668 --> 00:36.884
Wherever you may be, whatever you may
be doing,

00:37.085 --> 00:40.176
in whatever peril you may be,

00:40.377 --> 00:46.209
howsoever dangerously you may be placed
in life, She protects you.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.759
First thing, She protects you.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.384
All the people who write to Me how they
were protected,

00:52.585 --> 00:55.944
how they were cured, how they were
helped,

00:56.145 --> 01:00.701
is this thing: that they should know that
all this has happened

01:00.902 --> 01:04.594
because of Mahakali Power within you.

01:04.795 --> 01:07.092
She exists within you.

01:07.293 --> 01:11.749
When you are worshipping Mahakali you
are worshipping the Mahakali within you.

01:11.950 --> 01:14.905
With due respect you must know that
this Mahakali

01:15.106 --> 01:20.282
is a very sensitive personality. She is
very sensitive.

01:20.483 --> 01:25.306
If you try to do any wrong to anyone,

01:25.507 --> 01:29.040
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell you by many
ways

01:29.241 --> 01:33.744
that this is wrong you are doing - why you
are doing wrong to some person?

01:33.945 --> 01:38.680
But if you do not repent and come back
onto the normal position,

01:38.881 --> 01:43.266
She gives you up. Once Mahakali gives
you up

01:43.467 --> 01:49.680
you are now exposed and become prone
to all kinds of evil things.

01:52.115 --> 01:57.747
(…) So when you worship Her, what do
you want - you want Her to protect you.

01:57.948 --> 02:01.597
In your discrimination, in your mistake

02:01.798 --> 02:06.492
you might do something wrong;
may do something

02:06.693 --> 02:12.445
that is not good for you, could be very
dangerous for you.

02:12.646 --> 02:19.123
But She’s the person who guides you
how to avoid all the dangers.

02:19.324 --> 02:25.240
Now, She protects your life, She protects
your body,

02:25.441 --> 02:28.441
She protects all organs of your body.

02:28.642 --> 02:34.293
She’s the One who gives you all
the security of life.

02:34.761 --> 02:40.203
In Her realm you feel completely secure.

02:40.404 --> 02:43.221
You are never afraid of anything.

02:43.422 --> 02:47.123
Because you have left Her realm, you have
come out of it,

02:47.324 --> 02:50.392
that’s why, that is the reason you are
afraid.

02:50.593 --> 02:58.460
But if you are under Her beautiful guidance
and Her blessings,

02:58.661 --> 03:02.093
you will never feel afraid to do anything.

03:02.294 --> 03:04.664
You’ll never do anything wrong also.

03:04.865 --> 03:08.701
As soon as you’ll try to do wrong
She’ll hold your hand.

03:08.902 --> 03:15.870
She’s really the guiding person. She’s the
One who actually gives us our existence.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.761
Without Her we cannot exist,

03:18.962 --> 03:29.263
because She is the One who is the power
of Shri Shiva.

03:30.740 --> 03:33.268
She gives us so many things.

03:33.469 --> 03:41.499
For example, She gives us the relaxation,
the sleep.

03:41.700 --> 03:47.055
She gives you the truth. She tells you
what is the truth and what is not.

03:47.256 --> 03:52.262
Sometimes people, so much in their ego
always, try to believe that,

03:52.463 --> 03:55.833
“What I think is the truth.” Then She’s
the One

03:56.034 --> 04:04.914
who points it out by creating a maya,
a kind of a confusion,

04:05.115 --> 04:08.489
that you start thinking, “What is this?”

04:08.690 --> 04:14.068
So She is called also the One who gives
us bhranti, means “illusions”.

04:14.269 --> 04:17.611
She puts you to illusions also, She tests
you -

04:17.812 --> 04:24.516
puts you to illusions, and She then
ultimately takes you out of the illusions.

04:24.717 --> 04:30.540
She’s the One who relaxes you, because
She takes over all your responsibilities,

04:30.741 --> 04:35.452
She takes over all your problems. She’s
the One who solves all the problems.

04:35.653 --> 04:40.074
It is we who forget to leave all
the problems to Her.

04:40.275 --> 04:45.208
If you just leave problems to Her, all your
problems are solved.

04:45.409 --> 04:49.260
Not only that but you really feel blessed.

04:49.461 --> 04:53.706
It’s not only physical, also it is mental,

04:53.907 --> 04:58.305
that She makes your mind absolutely
free of worries.

04:58.506 --> 05:03.123
She doesn’t worry and She doesn’t want
you to worry.

05:03.324 --> 05:06.945
If you worry then She tries to show
that by your worrying

05:07.146 --> 05:12.247
you are denying Her, you are not accepting
Her.

05:12.448 --> 05:14.563
Worrying is something is very common,

05:14.764 --> 05:18.032
and people take great pride in saying,
“Oh, I was worried.”

05:18.240 --> 05:23.068
How can you be worried when your Mother
is sakshat Mahakali?

05:23.269 --> 05:26.929
She can kill all the demons, She can finish
all of them,

05:27.130 --> 05:32.281
She knows how to manage things; and when
you are like a child before Her,

05:32.482 --> 05:34.728
how can you worry about anything?

05:34.929 --> 05:37.615
So your worries are finished.

05:37.816 --> 05:40.916
She worries about you, you shouldn’t
worry about yourself.

05:41.117 --> 05:45.789
That’s the point is. Her security is
so great,

05:45.990 --> 05:53.542
She’s so secure Herself that She gives you
all the security that you need.

05:53.743 --> 05:59.227
You can hold on to Her Feet, you can hold
on to Her image

05:59.428 --> 06:02.914
or to anything. You can even pray to Her.

06:03.115 --> 06:09.455
Many people are being cured only by
praying to Her, because She cures you.

06:09.656 --> 06:15.686
She can cure your diseases which are very
complicated diseases, She can cure.

06:15.887 --> 06:21.081
Now what She likes, Mahakali likes
the light.

06:21.282 --> 06:25.643
She is worshipped in the night because
then we can put on the lights.

06:25.844 --> 06:32.257
She like enlightened person, also She likes
the light, She likes the sun,

06:32.458 --> 06:39.958
She likes something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

06:40.159 --> 06:44.580
You must have heard about people who are
called I don’t know what,

06:44.781 --> 06:49.962
but specially in the West they use them:

06:50.163 --> 06:56.580
they have big teeth and they - ha,

06:56.781 --> 07:04.664
and they are the people, they - just
imagine - they cannot exist before the sun.

07:04.865 --> 07:10.706
As soon as there is a sunrise they just
want to go off and sleep,

07:10.907 --> 07:16.039
whilst they cannot see the sun, because
the light they can’t bear.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.622
Now what has happened here that
Mahalakshmi has departed…

07:20.823 --> 07:24.123
Mahakali has departed from them,

07:24.324 --> 07:29.248
and when Mahakali has departed then
they are afraid;

07:29.449 --> 07:36.706
and such people are attacked by these
people who know they are afraid.

07:36.907 --> 07:44.161
The sun itself is very important to work
out this Mahakali thing.

07:44.362 --> 07:51.747
But as it is in the West specially, we are
very hard-working

07:51.948 --> 07:56.622
and very much sun-oriented and we
worship the sun.

07:56.823 --> 08:01.164
All this we do: worship the sun

08:01.365 --> 08:04.547
and also go right-sided very much.

08:04.748 --> 08:07.304
Then it is She who gives us the balance.

08:07.505 --> 08:15.874
She’s the One who gives us the balance by
relaxing us completely and protecting us.

08:16.075 --> 08:21.462
Sometimes we are competitive and we are
really worried,

08:21.663 --> 08:26.330
and we want to do something which we
cannot do.

08:26.531 --> 08:32.158
Then we get upset and we don’t know
what to do.

08:32.359 --> 08:37.242
Then it is She who brings sleep to us.

08:37.443 --> 08:40.585
So when we sleep She looks after us,

08:40.786 --> 08:45.227
She soothes us and She takes away
our problems.

08:45.428 --> 08:47.437
So many things She is doing.

08:47.638 --> 08:51.622
But what are we doing for Her, that we
should see.

08:51.823 --> 09:00.333
Main thing is that we are ourselves
worshipping Her.

09:01.204 --> 09:06.539
She likes that Her children should worship
Her,

09:06.740 --> 09:10.215
that on that level She can be one with
them.

09:10.416 --> 09:18.032
She can give them Her compassion, love
and protection from all the evil.

09:18.233 --> 09:24.412
But it has to be understood those who are
not yet settled,

09:24.613 --> 09:28.375
those who are not yet absolutely belonging

09:28.576 --> 09:36.406
to that land of security of Mahakali can be
attacked,

09:36.607 --> 09:40.774
and they, once they leave that area,
they can be

09:40.975 --> 09:47.914
very badly injured, killed, whatever may
can happen.

09:48.115 --> 09:56.297
So we are living in this Kali Yuga in
a very dangerous times

09:56.498 --> 10:01.747
whence anything can happen, so we have
to be very careful.

10:01.948 --> 10:06.240
We have to watch our mind to see how
it works.

10:06.441 --> 10:09.950
What does it teach you? What does it
tell you?

10:10.151 --> 10:18.083
Try to understand: what is the plan of this
evil person,

10:18.284 --> 10:23.998
that you are playing into his hands? How
can you play into his hands,

10:24.199 --> 10:28.580
and how can you do whatever wrong
he wants you to do?

10:28.781 --> 10:32.203
Secondly, against Her is the ego.

10:32.404 --> 10:36.075
The biggest problem is the ego today,

10:36.276 --> 10:39.249
ego which shows, “No, no, I can do this.”

10:39.450 --> 10:46.187
Ego says, “I will work it out.” Ego says,
“It will be done.”

10:46.388 --> 10:50.956
But the human beings, see, yield to ego.

10:51.157 --> 10:55.990
It’s of a great satisfaction for them
that their ego is so strong,

10:56.191 --> 11:01.599
and they don’t want to listen to
the Mahakali forces.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.625
(…) You have to be like children. Really,

11:04.826 --> 11:08.429
that’s the very best way is to be innocent
like children.

11:08.630 --> 11:13.078
She loves innocent people. She’s innocence
Herself.

11:13.279 --> 11:16.985
She loves innocent people, and She looks
after you

11:17.186 --> 11:20.302
much more because you are innocent,
you are not cunning,

11:20.503 --> 11:30.302
you are not very much trying to play
your ego on others.

11:30.503 --> 11:35.927
If you are innocent She’ll helps you,
She definitely will help you;

11:36.128 --> 11:39.672
but this ego has to be brought under
control,

11:39.873 --> 11:46.953
because he is the worst enemy She has.
She doesn’t like your ego.

11:47.134 --> 11:50.366
She wants you to be egoless, to be
innocent.

11:51.870 --> 11:56.377
(…) Then another thing She loves in you
is your compassion:

11:56.578 --> 12:00.377
compassion for each other, love for
each other,

12:00.578 --> 12:03.727
also caring for others.

12:03.928 --> 12:07.383
That is something She loves. If you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

12:07.584 --> 12:10.669
if you are a realized soul, She’s always
with you.

12:10.870 --> 12:15.836
But She says, “What are you doing with
your compassion?

12:16.037 --> 12:18.359
How many people you are giving Realization?

12:18.560 --> 12:24.695
How many people you are curing, how many
people you are helping?”

12:24.896 --> 12:28.288
She is quite aware of whatever you are
doing.

12:28.489 --> 12:33.003
I should say it’s such a tremendous power
of Mahakali

12:33.204 --> 12:36.867
that She knows everything about you -
everything.

12:37.068 --> 12:40.891
She knows your mind, She knows your heart,

12:41.092 --> 12:44.531
She knows about your health, everything
She knows;

12:44.732 --> 12:49.100
actually She is the Mother in every way

12:49.301 --> 12:54.265
who cares for the little child. In that way
She knows

12:54.466 --> 12:57.709
that this child doesn’t do anything,
he’s very innocent.

12:57.910 --> 13:02.384
So like when you are very small your mother
looks after you,

13:02.585 --> 13:06.146
in the same way this Mahakali looks after
you.

13:06.838 --> 13:10.541
(…) Everywhere in your life She is there.

13:10.742 --> 13:15.242
Specially with Sahaja Yogis, She follows
them up and down,

13:15.443 --> 13:17.639
everywhere, whatever you are doing.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.586
You are in an accident - She is there
to save you.

13:20.787 --> 13:25.679
She is like an angel behind you, and
nothing can happen to you

13:25.880 --> 13:29.510
if you really worship Her from your full
heart:

13:29.711 --> 13:34.478
not for any gain, not for any achievement,

13:34.679 --> 13:40.392
but for Her blessings. Her blessings are
very great

13:40.593 --> 13:47.360
and they really have enriched human beings.
They have enriched this earth.

13:47.561 --> 13:53.896
They have enriched everything because
of the blessings of Mahakali.

13:54.231 --> 13:57.593
(…) It will be the best way is to meditate.

13:57.794 --> 14:01.492
Not to be aggressive in any way, but just
to meditate

14:01.693 --> 14:06.011
and ask Mahakali, “Destroy, destroy him,

14:06.212 --> 14:09.260
for he’s destroying the world. You please
destroy.”

14:09.461 --> 14:11.672
That’s Her job and She would love to do,

14:11.873 --> 14:14.712
but somebody has to tell Her, and ask Her.

14:14.913 --> 14:18.086
It’s very good, because there are so many

14:18.287 --> 14:21.430
that unless and until you point it out,
She may not be able

14:21.631 --> 14:24.028
to put Her attention to them, possibly.

14:24.229 --> 14:28.765
So it’s best is always ask Her to help you,

14:28.966 --> 14:32.554
on individual basis, on a national basis,

14:32.755 --> 14:37.503
maybe in a collective basis or maybe
in a global basis.

14:37.712 --> 14:42.803
That’s what She exists everywhere,
She is globally available.

14:43.004 --> 14:47.242
Anywhere you may be having any color,
any race,

14:47.443 --> 14:53.837
any nation, anything; but She exists within
you all the time,

14:54.045 --> 15:01.561
and to worship Her and to awaken Her
is only your due that you have to do.

15:02.408 --> 15:07.957
(…) You have to do it in a way that is
a innocent act,

15:08.158 --> 15:11.617
that you are worshipping your Mother
like a little child

15:11.818 --> 15:15.795
worships and loves its mother. It’s a very
simple relationship

15:15.996 --> 15:19.719
which all of us have felt it, how we should
love our mother

15:19.920 --> 15:26.336
and how we should be under her guidance
and under her protection.

15:26.537 --> 15:30.207
That is something very simple you have
known in your childhood,

15:30.408 --> 15:36.416
and that childhood has to come back in you,
if you really worship the Mother.

15:36.617 --> 15:39.990
May God bless you.
