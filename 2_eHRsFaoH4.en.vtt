00:08.392 --> 00:13.743
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly aware,

00:13.824 --> 00:19.121
where you cross your mind, you go above your mind.

00:19.808 --> 00:25.796
Mind cannot affect you, this is the first
stage, as we call, is thoughtless awareness.

00:25.876 --> 00:32.425
Second one is where you start seeing the working of this Paramchaitanya,

00:32.505 --> 00:37.665
of this All-pervading Power and you start becoming aware t

00:37.745 --> 00:45.588
hat there is lot of truth in what Mataji says.

00:45.668 --> 00:50.837
That there is this Power that works out many things.

00:50.917 --> 00:54.740
It works miraculously so many things for you.

00:54.820 --> 01:02.171
It gives you blessings, It guides you, It
helps you in so many ways It helps you.

01:02.251 --> 01:08.985
It gives you good health, good wealth, and also a very good society

01:09.065 --> 01:13.224
of very beautiful people in the collective.

01:13.617 --> 01:17.407
All that you can see clearly is happening here.

01:20.086 --> 01:34.817
Now this happening of achieving thoughtless awareness

01:35.957 --> 01:43.355
is very simple and easy, but to maintain at that point is difficult,

01:43.855 --> 01:48.676
we still react and we think.

01:48.757 --> 01:51.313
Anything you see, you react.

01:51.393 --> 02:02.139
To get to that point in thoughtless awareness is first to change your attention.

02:03.085 --> 02:11.247
Now, for example, once we were climbing a very high mountain to see one temple

02:11.754 --> 02:16.459
called Palitana – Myself, My son-in-law and My daughter.

02:16.959 --> 02:21.611
And we were really tired because we had to climb – I don’t know how many steps –

02:21.691 --> 02:25.094
and when we went up we were tired and there was a little canopy

02:25.174 --> 02:30.350
made of beautiful marble carving, so we just lay down there ourselves.

02:31.543 --> 02:35.618
They were very tired and they said : “What is this kind of a temple?”

02:35.698 --> 02:37.038
They were grudging.

02:37.118 --> 02:44.756
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful elephants were carved.

02:45.486 --> 02:47.370
So I told My son-in-law :

02:47.450 --> 02:52.425
“Look at these elephants, they all have tails of different types.”

02:52.591 --> 02:57.836
He said “Mummy, we are all dying, how can you see the tails of elephants?”

02:58.985 --> 03:04.796
But is just to divert their attention from that tiredness,

03:04.876 --> 03:10.737
I told them that – why not see the tails
of the elephant, which is very different.

03:10.817 --> 03:17.784
So what happens that, when you are putting your attention

03:17.883 --> 03:21.030
so much to outside all the time,

03:22.183 --> 03:26.999
then you must first of all also divert your attention.

03:27.179 --> 03:31.627
For example, you see these beautifully made things here.

03:31.707 --> 03:36.356
Your attention is something else – just try to enjoy the beauty of that.

03:36.625 --> 03:42.388
See, there are beautiful carpets here, just look at them without thinking,

03:42.481 --> 03:45.196
because they don’t belong to you, so no headache,

03:45.276 --> 03:49.162
they belong to somebody else, is very good! Otherwise, if it belongs to you,

03:49.242 --> 03:52.269
you start thinking ; “Oh, My God, I have spread them here,

03:52.349 --> 03:56.329
what will happen, they have to be insured!” Or some sort of a thing like that.

03:56.409 --> 03:59.250
That’s common human reaction.

03:59.330 --> 04:02.913
But if it doesn’t belong to you, you can watch it nicely.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.579
Now you watch it and don’t think.

04:05.659 --> 04:11.078
You’ll be amazed, when you see the beauty that is put inside this,

04:11.158 --> 04:15.946
you’ll see the artist who has put his joy, his exuberance into it,

04:16.026 --> 04:20.273
and you’ll be amazed, after Realization, that,

04:20.353 --> 04:27.271
this exuberance will fill into you and a cool kind of a relaxation

04:27.351 --> 04:32.379
will come into you, and this Kundalini will rise,

04:32.465 --> 04:35.866
and you’ll become steady in your thoughtless awareness.

04:35.946 --> 04:38.710
So whenever you look at anything,

04:38.790 --> 04:46.836
look at any beautiful thing, even say, today’s election,

04:46.916 --> 04:50.189
just watch the man who is elected.

04:50.269 --> 04:55.320
Watching him itself, gives him blessings, gives him better ideas.

04:55.400 --> 05:02.791
You get also ideas, which are coming from reality, which are there :

05:02.871 --> 05:11.454
how to make this man a successful person,
or this country a successful democracy.

05:11.534 --> 05:16.835
All these things happen when your attention is diverted

05:16.915 --> 05:23.257
from criticizing, from reacting.

05:23.557 --> 05:28.520
Just you watch, become the witness, try to witness everything.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.743
It’s not so very yet practised.

05:32.823 --> 05:39.256
So far, I’ve seen, that whenever even
we get our- achieve our Realization,

05:39.336 --> 05:43.651
we don’t realize that we have to witness everything.

05:44.271 --> 05:47.385
When you start witnessing through your Spirit,

05:47.465 --> 05:53.390
then you don’t see the bad points of another, but you see the good points.

05:53.470 --> 05:59.175
You just pick up the person with very good points.

05:59.255 --> 06:06.726
So once you see that the witness state enlarges,

06:06.806 --> 06:09.688
and you start enjoying another person,

06:09.768 --> 06:12.606
you start enjoying everything that is there,

06:12.686 --> 06:19.829
even a small blade of grass you can enjoy, if you have that capacity.

06:21.434 --> 06:27.010
In Japan, Zen system started on these lines.

06:27.090 --> 06:33.179
And he made, Viditama was the person who started it,

06:33.259 --> 06:42.654
he made a garden out of moss, different moss, and very small.

06:42.734 --> 06:45.309
Then there were little, little flowers also.

06:45.389 --> 06:49.361
And hardly about five feet of the garden,

06:49.442 --> 06:55.180
which looks like a shape of a question mark you can say.

06:55.260 --> 07:00.626
You have to go on a lift, and you reach that platform

07:00.706 --> 07:05.210
on top of a hill, or a mountain, where you see this.

07:05.290 --> 07:08.420
All little, little mosses are there,

07:08.500 --> 07:12.548
and you see, differently arranged, a beautiful garden.

07:13.443 --> 07:17.604
When you start seeing it, your thought stops,

07:17.957 --> 07:22.924
because such a marvellous thing, when you put attention to it, to its creation,

07:23.004 --> 07:24.641
your thoughts stop.

07:24.721 --> 07:31.003
So you must practise as to find out what stops your thoughts,

07:31.083 --> 07:33.633
what makes you the witness.

07:33.713 --> 07:35.823
Once you develop this habit,

07:35.903 --> 07:41.579
you will station yourself nicely in the thoughtless awareness.

07:41.959 --> 07:50.712
Then you start watching how Sahaja Yoga
has helped you, how it has been blissful,

07:50.792 --> 07:53.996
what you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

07:54.615 --> 07:58.359
You will be amazed, if you just start watching it,

07:58.439 --> 08:05.228
everywhere you’ll be amazed how this Paramchaitanya acts.

08:05.308 --> 08:10.566
Nowadays, this Paramchaitanya has
become active because of Krita Yuga.

08:10.646 --> 08:17.686
You can see from the way it is playing
around, with vibrations around Me.

08:17.766 --> 08:23.803
You’ve seen so many photographs of
mine where these vibrations are there.

08:23.883 --> 08:27.876
Also you’ve seen the photographs of
many Sahaja Yogis seating before Me,

08:27.956 --> 08:32.222
on their heads My name is written down in Arabic language.

08:32.302 --> 08:36.249
You’ve seen so many ways by which you can find out

08:36.329 --> 08:40.762
that there is the play of the Divine.

08:40.842 --> 08:46.871
Now the mind will still try to say something: don’t listen, just watch.

08:48.213 --> 08:53.247
The effect of Sahaja Yoga you should watch on yourself, on your all body.

08:53.327 --> 08:58.308
Don’t think about it but watch it, and you’ll be amazed how you have changed.

08:58.389 --> 09:01.602
To be very frank, when I come to Australia every year,

09:01.682 --> 09:04.041
sometimes I can’t even recognize you.

09:04.121 --> 09:08.334
You look much younger, much better, much happier.

09:08.414 --> 09:11.592
And I don’t recognize who are these people.
