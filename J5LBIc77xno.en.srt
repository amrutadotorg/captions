1
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,840
Today we are celebrating the resurrection
of Christ.

2
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,860
That is the greatest message of Christ's life,
not the crucifixion.

3
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:55,720
Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this
dead body of Christ was resurrected from death.

4
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Death itself died, and He overcome it.

5
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:19,660
It's a miracle for ordinary human beings,
definitely, but not for Christ, because He

6
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,710
was a Divine person.

7
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:30,770
He was Shri Ganesha, He was Omkara Itself.

8
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:41,310
So He could walk on the water, gravity would
not affect Him.

9
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:50,100
And also He got resurrected because death
could not affect Him.

10
00:02:50,100 --> 00:03:03,040
Such a great Divine personality, specially
created for human beings, that people should

11
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,250
recognize Him.

12
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,380
But they did not recognize Him.

13
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:15,060
They killed Him in a very brutal manner.

14
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:26,570
And even now they think cross is a great thing
because Christ died on the cross.

15
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:34,950
It's a very cruel idea of human beings to
respect the cross.

16
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,689
What does it show?

17
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:55,140
It shows that people liked all the cruelties
done to Him, symbolizing cross as the one

18
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:05,279
that represented His death and His atrocities,
the way He was tortured.

19
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:15,080
So it was a very sad time when He was crucified.

20
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:26,400
But when He got resurrected, it was the most
joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful

21
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
time.

22
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:39,910
The resurrection of Christ is very symbolic
for Sahaja Yoga.

23
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:52,320
If Christ could be resurrected, then human
beings also can be resurrected, because He

24
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:01,480
came as a human being with all powers, and
He created the path of resurrection for us.

25
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,100
This path of resurrection is the one that
we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.

26
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:19,790
But the greatest thing is the piercing of
the Agnya Chakra which is described in all

27
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:34,250
spiritual treatise, or may be called as the
scriptures, that that is the door which is

28
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:44,720
golden, which is like a cover, and no one
can pass through that, so constricted is this

29
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,514
door of Agnya Chakra.

30
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:55,385
But Christ did cross that.

31
00:05:55,385 --> 00:06:06,775
His crossing has helped us today to
open your Agnya.

32
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:12,554
Without opening the Agnya you cannot go to
Sahasrara.

33
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:22,285
And this was done so easily in your case,
only because Christ could go through all that

34
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:28,675
torture and all that brutality, and crossed
over.

35
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:39,204
How much we should be indebted to Him, I don't
know words that can express, because He is

36
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:45,804
the One who took lead in telling people that
“You seek.

37
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,905
You seek and you'll find.”

38
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:58,174
And then He says that “You have to come
and bang at the door.”

39
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:06,595
This is exactly what has happened in your
case, that you have risen up to Agnya and

40
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:10,245
then you have crossed beyond Agnya.

41
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:21,035
This crossing of Agnya was not at all difficult
for you, though by your own ideas of thinking

42
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:28,614
and of conditioning, of the futuristic planning
and all that, it was a big, big crowd, I should

43
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:36,334
say, of very black clouds were hovering on
the Agnya.

44
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:45,484
Your thoughts were overpowering you, and you
could not have penetrated through this Agnya

45
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:47,894
which was all covered.

46
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:54,655
But you did, and you never even felt that
you have crossed the Agnya Chakra so easily.

47
00:07:54,655 --> 00:08:03,604
The first of all, we all should really be
very thankful to Christ for opening the Agnya

48
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:04,945
for you.

49
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:15,304
For Him all the tortures and all the brutality
were nothing, because His purpose of life,

50
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:23,725
His purpose of His advent, His incarnation,
was to break the Agnya Chakra.

51
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:31,824
Today you will find that even though your
Agnya is opened out and you have crossed through,

52
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:43,644
still you'll be amazed that people get involved
in the Agnya Chakra.

53
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:48,755
In Sahaja Yoga people do get involved in Agnya
Chakra.

54
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:55,745
Now how do we see through introspection what
happens to us?

55
00:08:55,745 --> 00:09:08,635
For example, once people come to Sahaja Yoga,
they think they are in charge: in charge of

56
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:18,355
this, in charge of that, in charge of all
the Sahaja Yogis; and they start behaving

57
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:24,235
in a manner which doesn't behove a Sahaja
Yogi.

58
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:25,975
It doesn't.

59
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:34,195
I've seen them, and I really am amused the
way they just start thrusting themselves and

60
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:39,965
showing off that they are very much in charge.

61
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:42,755
This is nothing modern.

62
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:48,095
This is used to be there with human beings.

63
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:55,754
But if it was so, it was before Sahaja Yoga.

64
00:09:55,754 --> 00:10:04,795
Even now people get into the mood of dominating
others by saying that “We are in charge.”

65
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:12,375
Sahaja Yoga is not so simple as you think,
because there are lots of temptations.

66
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,855
Supposing you make somebody a leader.

67
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:27,235
Now a leader becomes sort of “in charge,”
you know, and he gets the drunkenness of power.

68
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:39,395
When he's like that he starts dominating all
the rest of the people, and also starts showing

69
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:53,265
off that he's something very great and he
has to dominate all the rest of the people.

70
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,345
Then he creates an atmosphere of fear.

71
00:10:55,345 --> 00:11:02,025
Firstly, I've seen what happens with them
is that they start saying falsely that “Mother

72
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:07,665
has told this, Mother has said so, this is
Mother's ideas.”

73
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:11,985
I have nothing to do with that gentleman,
but he goes on talking like that, and people

74
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,554
get very frightened.

75
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:20,055
Then also he can also frighten you by saying,
“I will tell Mother.

76
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:25,184
Mother will listen to me and She'll punish
you.”

77
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:32,395
I am sometimes very surprised at such people,
because I have never said that I'll punish

78
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:39,254
somebody or I'll take him out of Sahaja Yoga
- nothing of the kind.

79
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:43,874
So this man who thinks no end of himself,
he may be a leader, may not be a leader, may

80
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:53,444
be nothing in Sahaja Yoga; and then if he
starts talking like this in such a funny manner

81
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:58,095
that it doesn't look that the person is a
Sahaja Yogi.

82
00:11:58,095 --> 00:12:04,785
Then he goes even further.

83
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:15,374
He goes himself describing as something very
great, as if he's the one who is chosen specially

84
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:18,295
for rising higher and higher.

85
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:22,254
When I hear about these things I'm really
amazed.

86
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:33,064
How can people befool themselves all the time,
and behave in such a manner?

87
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:36,585
First thing in Sahaja Yoga is humility.

88
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:40,837
If you are not a humble person, you cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi.

89
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:50,626
The person who orders about, the person who
talks in a manner as if he is Hitler, any

90
00:12:50,626 --> 00:13:01,086
person who tries to control and be in charge
of the thing, all these capacities only show

91
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:06,934
that that person has achieved nothing in Sahaja
Yoga.

92
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:11,225
First thing is to enjoy the humility.

93
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:16,924
I've seen people like this, they'll always
sit in the first row.

94
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:20,785
They'll be always sitting in a place where
you just see them all the time there.

95
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,525
I just smile.

96
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,995
I know they are just show-offs.

97
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:30,554
They think no end of themselves, and that's
why they are there.

98
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:36,535
But they themselves are losing, they themselves
are not very happy.

99
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:43,345
That's why they try to do all these tricks
and this kind of domination.

100
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:58,385
The other side of it is people who are humble,
who are simple, who are honest and who are

101
00:13:58,385 --> 00:14:03,825
really seeking the truth, are being oppressed
by this gentleman.

102
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:12,455
He oppresses them, tries to show off, tries
to make slaves out of others.

103
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:23,835
I have seen people have gone so far that there
was a group of people who just would not move

104
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:29,064
even an inch without the permission of their
leader.

105
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:37,205
And they would go all out to be subservient
to such a irrational personality.

106
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:44,374
First of all, you know this is the love of
Mother.

107
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:47,015
Mother never dominates.

108
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:51,585
She cannot dominate, because She is nothing
but love.

109
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:58,295
As soon as She sees the problem, immediately
She absorbs it.

110
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:06,655
She has to make deliberations, just a drama
sometimes to show that She's angry.

111
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,455
But She cannot basically be angry with anyone.

112
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:17,675
It's the love which all the time, all the
time is flowing.

113
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:21,815
And that love envelops the Mother, as well
as envelops you.

114
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:26,694
That is how you people will understand Sahaja
Yoga.

115
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:31,694
What does a human being need is nothing but
love and compassion, love and compassion of

116
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:37,155
a very, very pure type.

117
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:42,385
Look at Christ.

118
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:46,325
He pitied the people who crucified Him.

119
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:53,275
He told His Father, the God Almighty, that
“Please forgive them, because they do not

120
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,575
know what they are doing.”

121
00:15:55,575 --> 00:16:02,955
He could see that the blindness of these people
are doing wrong things, and God the Father

122
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:07,685
will be very annoyed, Who is wrathful and
may destroy them.

123
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:21,225
So this is what it was done with a very compassionate
feeling, without thinking about, just automatically

124
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:30,475
He felt that these people are doing all this
to Me, and I don't know what will happen to

125
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,915
them.

126
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:34,434
So He prayed to God, to Father, “Please
forgive.

127
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,614
Please forgive them, for they do not know
what they are doing.

128
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:41,235
They are blind, so please do not punish them.”

129
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,285
What compassion!

130
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,325
What love!

131
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:50,424
I mean, think of it: do we do that in our
life?

132
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:59,194
If somebody harms us, troubles us, do we ask
Father to forgive those who do not know what

133
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:00,194
they are doing?

134
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:06,635
That should be the level of Sahaja Yoga, and
it will work out very well.

135
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:13,905
If you ask for forgiveness, God will look
after them, He’ll transform them, He'll

136
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:17,624
bring them to their senses.

137
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:28,795
The message of Christ are full of love, compassion,
pure compassion.

138
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:36,875
How He tried to protect Mary Magdalene is
an example of that, who was leading a sinful

139
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:43,355
life; and for a saint it had nothing to do,
He had nothing to do with her.

140
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:51,205
But when He saw she being stoned by people,
He stood against her, took a stone in His

141
00:17:51,205 --> 00:18:02,165
own hand, and He says, “All right, those
who have not committed any wrong deed or have

142
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:07,995
not committed any sin, can take this stone
and hit Me.”

143
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:15,175
And nobody came forward, because they had
to face themselves.

144
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:28,255
When we are dominating others, then a kind
of a cruel joy is there, some sort of a joy

145
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:33,335
that I don't understand Myself, but people
have.

146
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:41,865
They show off that we have achieved this joy,
we have achieved this great power.

147
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:52,405
It has happened for centuries, with all the
great emperors and also despotic rulers.

148
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:57,385
But with Sahaja Yogis it should be the other
way round.

149
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:05,485
They have to rule the world with peace and
love.

150
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:09,025
They don't have to show off, by any chance.

151
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:13,025
This is how Sahaja Yoga will spread much,
much fast.

152
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:19,165
What does the world need? - you just think
of it.

153
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:20,845
It needs only love and affection.

154
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:34,245
Those people who are yet lost in the ignorance
about life and are still busy troubling others,

155
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:42,925
torturing others, going against the collectivity,
will have to return to normalcy.

156
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:48,885
It’s very abnormal behavior sometimes, and
you just don’t understand why they behave

157
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:49,885
like mad people.

158
00:19:49,885 --> 00:20:01,435
It is very difficult also to tell such a person
that “You are mad.”

159
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:09,315
And also it’s difficult to be with such
a person who is so mad with some sort of a

160
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:10,565
power.

161
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:15,855
It goes on like that with so many Sahaja Yogis,
I have seen, who start thinking they have

162
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:25,035
lots of powers, they can do whatever they
like, they can talk to anyone and they can

163
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:26,535
confuse everyone.

164
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:36,365
But in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to confuse,
you have to clearly express your love.

165
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:43,795
But that doesn’t mean any kind of a particular
gesture or a particular happening, but it

166
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:51,325
is just a inner oneness with each other.

167
00:20:51,325 --> 00:21:06,065
Is, sometimes I find Sahaja Yogis so much
understanding each other, so much loving each

168
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:13,675
other, so beautifully enjoying the love of
other people.

169
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:21,195
When I see that I feel very, very happy, absolutely
overjoyed.

170
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:30,585
That’s what I wanted: these people should
enjoy, is there.

171
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:38,475
And you’ll be amazed, the most enjoyable
thing is the love that you give to others.

172
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:45,785
You may not receive, but when you give love
to others, then it’s the most enjoyable

173
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:46,785
thing.

174
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:58,885
But the way you express yourself is also an
art, I think, to understand how to please

175
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,815
others, how to make them happy.

176
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:07,645
I've told this story before also, about a
saint who lived in Gaganbhoura, is a, what

177
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:14,085
you can say is a hill or a mountain.

178
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:23,615
He used to live there and he couldn't walk,
you see: because of vibrations he lost his

179
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:28,655
legs or something, the power in them.

180
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:37,415
And then he would go all over the place on
a tiger, because tiger loved him and he loved

181
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:39,255
the tiger.

182
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:47,345
So this gentleman was all the time telling
people from Bombay, “What are you doing

183
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:48,345
here?

184
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:49,345
Mother has come!

185
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:51,135
Go and touch Her Feet.”

186
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:57,225
I didn't know why he was so much concerned.

187
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:00,575
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “I must go and meet
him.”

188
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:07,715
So all these gurus, you see, they say that
“We don't leave our pillows.

189
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:14,065
We have to be in our own pillow” - means
wherever they live, they exist, they won't

190
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:15,065
go out.

191
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:18,255
I'm the other way round.

192
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:22,045
I'm never stationed in one place, you see.

193
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:25,005
So they asked if I could go.

194
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,115
I said, “Why not?”

195
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:31,945
So I went there, and the Sahaja Yogis said
that “Mother, You never go anywhere, so

196
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:35,265
why do You want to go here?”

197
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:43,865
I said, “All right, see the vibrations,”
and it’s tremendous vibrations.

198
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:49,115
So when I went up, this fellow was very angry
with the rain because he was supposed to control

199
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:53,105
the rain, he was supposed to be controlling
the rain.

200
00:23:53,105 --> 00:24:03,955
It's very surprising that when I went up,
he could not control and I got completely

201
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:04,955
drenched.

202
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:08,585
So he was very angry.

203
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:15,135
He was sitting on a stone, you know, and he
was going like this with anger.

204
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:16,315
I didn't say anything to him.

205
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:27,265
I went inside and sat in the cave, where he
had made some arrangement for Me to be seated.

206
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:34,735
Then he came, he touched My Feet, and he sat
down.

207
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:42,925
And I was amazed that he was still angry and
he couldn't understand why the rain could

208
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:43,925
not stop.

209
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:50,435
So he asked Me, “Why did You not allow me
to stop that rain?

210
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:58,255
Because after all You are coming to see me
all the way, and the rain should have behaved.

211
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:04,165
And I also could not somehow or other control
the rain, so what was the thing, what was

212
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:05,165
the lesson?”

213
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:06,645
I just smiled.

214
00:25:06,645 --> 00:25:14,595
I said, “See, you are an ascetic, you are
a sanyasi, and I am your Mother.

215
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:23,185
I cannot take a sari from you because after
all you are a sanyasi, and you are not supposed

216
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:26,205
to take anything from a sanyasi.”

217
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:32,195
Even the Mother cannot take anything from
him.

218
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:35,925
“But you have bought a nice sari for Me.

219
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:41,485
So I had to get drenched so that I could take
a sari from you.”

220
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:46,785
You see, the sweetness of My telling him just
made him melt down.

221
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:49,195
He started crying.

222
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:56,175
He said, “We need a Mother for this world.

223
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:58,337
There should be the Mother.

224
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:06,455
We cannot solve it, because whatever it is,
we get angry or we want to disappear.

225
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:18,015
We don't want to be with these horrible people
who are so sinful, to help them.”

226
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:24,325
This is the problem with the world today,
and that's why you find very few spiritual

227
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:28,335
people in the whole world.

228
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:36,565
Because they are the ones who are being very
much tortured, troubled, insulted, all kinds

229
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:40,565
of things happen.

230
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:45,295
So they're struggling, struggling, so they
want to die very fast.

231
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:55,995
Gyaneshwara, such a great personality, such
a great writer, poet, I mean he was everything,

232
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:58,855
so beautifully he has written.

233
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:06,015
But at the age of twenty-three he took his
samadhi, means he went into a cave, and closed

234
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,665
the cave and died there.

235
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:17,215
Must have been tired and fed up with the surroundings
of ignorant people, and that's why he did.

236
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:26,945
So you can imagine a person like Gyaneshwara,
who was the incarnation of Kartikeya, had

237
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:36,465
to recede into the world of the dead because
he couldn't bear it any more the way they

238
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:37,875
were torturing them.

239
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:47,945
They tortured him so much, saying that he
is the son of a sanyasi and he has, I mean

240
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:57,945
it's like this: “son of a sanyasi” means
he is no good, he is absolutely like an illegitimate

241
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:05,355
child; and he is ill-treated to such an extent,
he didn't even have shoes to wear in that

242
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:06,435
heat of India.

243
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,225
He used to walk bare feet.

244
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:15,875
And his sister, brother, who were great scholars,
who were great saints, great incarnations,

245
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,455
all of themself.

246
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:26,575
As a result he wanted just to disappear, and
he made a beautiful way of doing it, that

247
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:34,285
he told them that “I have to go,” and
he took leave from them and went inside his

248
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:39,285
cave, and got his samadhi.

249
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:45,185
Even Christ was very young when He was crucified.

250
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:51,265
He was thirty-three years of age.

251
00:28:51,265 --> 00:29:08,445
It was all planned by the Divine that He was
to be crucified, to make way for our Sahaja

252
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:19,855
Yoga: to open the Agnya, to sacrifice His
life, and for Him to be hanged in such a horrendous,

253
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:29,845
cruel way, which normally you do not find
people behaving in such a manner towards a

254
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:32,705
person who is about to die.

255
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:41,515
So what happened, that those people who were
in charge of His crucifixion must have been

256
00:29:41,515 --> 00:29:45,165
some devils, the way they behaved.

257
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:53,215
It is not possible to forgive them even if
He, Christ says; it's difficult to forgive

258
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:59,095
such people who were watching the crucifixion
of Christ.

259
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:17,405
So if that is the case that a person like
Him thought that “Let Me do My job, is to

260
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:20,935
break Sahasrara.”

261
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:28,375
And then He didn't want to live, live with
these stupid people to be tortured, and He

262
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:35,555
just disappeared into Kashmir, where He lived
after His resurrection.

263
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:48,135
Lots of stories are there about His ascent
and His resurrection, and you see, all those

264
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:55,535
stories if you read, you'll be amazed how
miraculously He got His second birth, you

265
00:30:55,535 --> 00:31:00,645
can say, or second life in Kashmir.

266
00:31:00,645 --> 00:31:08,535
He lived in Kashmir happily for some time
with His Mother, and there He died.

267
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:17,755
They say there's a grave of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and also His Mother who was there.

268
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:24,745
But who has taken advantage of His life, from
His life?

269
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:25,745
Who are the people really who wanted Him to
die?

270
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:31,635
You know very well.

271
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:51,365
You know very well how Christ died, and the
people came up suddenly, like Paul and Peter,

272
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:53,965
who tried to make a big business out of it.

273
00:31:53,965 --> 00:32:07,885
It's very sad to see that these two persons
brought such a shame.

274
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:14,035
This Paul was nothing but an organizer, I
think, also a beginner.

275
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:18,935
You see, he was a person who was bureaucratic,
I should say.

276
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:25,335
But he was not only bureaucratic, he was also
a man who wanted to have a big position.

277
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:38,305
So he told a lie that he went down to Damascus,
and on his way, on his way he saw a big cross.

278
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:48,305
According to Sahaja Yoga all such signs are
a sign of supra-conscious, is not of the Spirit.

279
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:55,275
And then he came back and he started his own
research, and sort of things like that.

280
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,675
And he's written a lot of things.

281
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:08,025
But throughout if you read, you'll find that
he was not a Sahaja Yogi, he was just an organizer.

282
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:14,555
He was a bureaucratic personality who was
writing how we should administer, how we should

283
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:23,415
have people who are different types of people,
how should we manage them.

284
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:25,655
So he's management department.

285
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:29,325
He was the management department for the Christians.

286
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:39,045
So the Christians also became extremely, very
secretariat type: like you see, everything

287
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:46,705
has a time, you must come like this, you must
sit like this, must talk like this.

288
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:54,085
And also the nations which are supposed to
be Christians are observing all that in a

289
00:33:54,085 --> 00:33:55,945
very official manner.

290
00:33:55,945 --> 00:34:12,375
It is not understood why, why are they so
much official in everything?

291
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:20,945
Just the opposite what Christ did, is to break
the Agnya, they built up this.

292
00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:28,465
And the Christian nations became the most
arrogant, most aggressive nations in the whole

293
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:29,465
world.

294
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:35,265
For them, it was their right to occupy any
land they saw.

295
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:46,074
It was in their right to establish their own
laws, their own, I should say, assemblies.

296
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:49,435
All this is done in India, I know.

297
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:59,945
Even today if you go to places like Punjab
and all that, you'll find the people are just

298
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:14,435
living like rustic people working very hard,
and they are all the time under attack from

299
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:27,105
people who are dominating, and those who wanted
the full advantage to be taken out of these

300
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:30,004
people.

301
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:38,234
It was a ridiculous thing to behave like that
as Christians.

302
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:42,274
Then also they started converting people.

303
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:46,355
It's another nonsense, converting.

304
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:51,295
Converting them in the south, in the...

305
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:57,754
What they did is to - we Indians never make
breads; they don't know how to use an oven

306
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:58,934
in the south.

307
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:06,475
So they made huge, big cakes - you can call
it a cake or you can call it a bread - and

308
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:16,484
put it in the water or in a well, and they
would say that we have put the part of the

309
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:24,744
calf of a buffalo or could be a cow, or something
like that.

310
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:27,925
And they just believed them.

311
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:34,284
And so they said, “Now you are finished,
because you're no more belonging to Hindu

312
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:37,134
religion or to any other religion.

313
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:39,504
So now you have become Christian.”

314
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:47,975
And that's how they made thousands and thousands
of people Christians who were actually downtrodden

315
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:53,014
people, I should say - at least, they would
call themselves downtrodden.

316
00:36:53,014 --> 00:37:02,655
Now all these downtrodden people, they wanted
to have converted to Christianity, because

317
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:17,605
they thought - you see, it is, they all wanted
all such people who would just follow the

318
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:23,964
missionaries, and who would not question.

319
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:31,964
Because they were not educated people, they're
not people of any understanding or intelligence

320
00:37:31,964 --> 00:37:34,805
to understand what these people are.

321
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:42,665
So when they started this tirade against the
downtrodden people, so many of them joined.

322
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:54,254
Thus they formed their own race and they started
their religion there.

323
00:37:54,254 --> 00:38:00,974
This is a thing one should understand, how
the dominating nature of people accepted a

324
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:09,964
particular religion, because that religion
is nothing but humility.

325
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:19,984
And how then these people supposed to be in
charge of Christianity, converted people into

326
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:22,395
something absurd.

327
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:33,895
You see it is a human nature, it can enjoy
any nonsense, any kind of cruelty, any kind

328
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,194
of oppression.

329
00:38:35,194 --> 00:38:44,145
It can never give up that realm, that area
where they have been dominating.

330
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:54,415
Now as it is, the Christian nations have gone
even beyond that, because among the Christians

331
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,935
it is all the freedom given to them.

332
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,115
They're liberated.

333
00:38:59,115 --> 00:39:05,014
Do whatever you may like, if you will become
Christian.

334
00:39:05,014 --> 00:39:07,965
They're all right, isn’t it?

335
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:16,024
They are the ones who have been dominating,
and those who are dominated are there everywhere.

336
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:26,254
They would go to people, ordinary people whom
you can call as aboriginals, and convert them.

337
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:28,545
Theirs main method was to convert.

338
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:32,795
What was the need to convert so many people?

339
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:39,075
Because in democracy it is important that
the number you have should be large.

340
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:47,714
So to gain the number, they used to convert.

341
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:53,944
And they have ruined so many people.

342
00:39:53,944 --> 00:40:04,784
It’s really, the whole situation of Christ
really makes Me feel very nervous.

343
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:08,464
Today you all are Sahaja Yogis.

344
00:40:08,464 --> 00:40:14,974
You are all so much higher than others.

345
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:20,865
You have all the powers.

346
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:28,865
And then supposing you want to behave like
the Christians, I don't know what you will

347
00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:29,865
do.

348
00:40:29,865 --> 00:40:38,795
So now you are on the verge where Sahaja Yoga
is accepted in different countries, and there

349
00:40:38,795 --> 00:40:46,424
people respect people who are Sahaja Yogis,
they have given positions.

350
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:54,444
Then suddenly you might get this power business
into your head and you may try, you may try

351
00:40:54,444 --> 00:41:04,075
to become like a despot, because that is human
nature.

352
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:10,065
That's not divine, but that's a human nature.

353
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:24,115
For example, when in the kingdom of, we can
say of the animals, they are aggressive on

354
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:29,355
each other, it's all right, it's permitted,
it is done.

355
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:34,885
But there's a system, there's a way, there's
a method how they dominate.

356
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:38,125
It's not like this: they jump on everyone.

357
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:44,185
But I've seen in Sahaja Yoga many people,
you make them a leader - finished.

358
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:47,464
Then he sits on everybody's head.

359
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:51,875
If you don't make them a leader then they
go on writing letters to Me, one after another,

360
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:55,095
that “Mother, we want to be leader.

361
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,465
I want to be a leader.”

362
00:41:57,465 --> 00:42:00,575
Like this they go on insisting on this.

363
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:05,065
For what do you want to be the leader?

364
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,465
Just to dominate others.

365
00:42:07,465 --> 00:42:12,754
And this domination business is not meant
for Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:25,764
I am here today to tell you about, about a
beautiful image of Christ, who rose above

367
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:26,905
death.

368
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:44,214
In the same way let the death of all nonsensical
ideas, all negative thoughts, everything has

369
00:42:44,214 --> 00:42:47,825
to be overcome.

370
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:56,784
You have to be the lord of yourself, and in
that you should feel so comforted, so happy.

371
00:42:56,784 --> 00:43:07,555
In giving others, you’ll find it very much
easier than taking something from others.

372
00:43:07,555 --> 00:43:16,984
It’s very, very surprising how Sahaja Yoga
has taught you all these things.

373
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:27,145
In Sahaj Yog people have to say that “They
are very wonderful, they are very beautiful

374
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:28,145
people.

375
00:43:28,145 --> 00:43:34,465
They are very loving, they are very kind.”

376
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:46,205
I want to, I want to hear that all the time
about them, about you all, that you all are

377
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:53,974
individually or collectively, you are something
outstandingly great.

378
00:43:53,974 --> 00:44:07,835
But this greatness is not by domination or
by showing off, but it is coming from within.

379
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:10,395
People see you and know it is something.

380
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:13,115
And that is how Sahaja Yoga is going to spread.

381
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:20,924
It is the Christ within you has to arise,
Christ within you has to guide.

382
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:30,805
It is Christ within you who will teach how
to behave towards others, and how to gain

383
00:44:30,805 --> 00:44:38,705
their confidence and give them the love and
peace that you have now flowing within you,

384
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:44,744
to make them very, very happy and joyous people.

385
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:47,675
This is the message of resurrection.

386
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:52,514
This is the message of breaking the Sahasrara.

387
00:44:52,514 --> 00:45:02,234
So this egg which was described in the - very
surprising, very clearly described in "Devi

388
00:45:02,234 --> 00:45:09,135
Mahatmayam," how this egg was formed and was
broken into two, and from one part of the

389
00:45:09,135 --> 00:45:12,045
egg came out Christ.

390
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:15,684
Another part was Shri Ganesha.

391
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:25,575
It’s all written down, but this Christ is
described as Mahavishnu, not as Christ, so

392
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:34,075
this Mahavishnu then rose and He does all
these, all wonderful things.

393
00:45:34,075 --> 00:45:46,855
It’s a real message beautifully written
by the life of Christ, that now as we are

394
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:58,164
thoughtlessly aware now, we have to express
that light through our lives, and we have

395
00:45:58,164 --> 00:46:09,545
to show to the world that we are quite capable,
and that only we are within ourselves absolutely

396
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:10,545
complete.

397
00:46:10,545 --> 00:46:13,504
We don’t want anything from others.

398
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:18,954
What we want now, to give whatever we have
achieved to others.

399
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:27,575
This is what people are looking at you, and
at all the Sahaja Yogis.

400
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:34,494
May God bless you.

401
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:49,635
Thinking of Christ, I find it impossible to
keep awake even because, to keep in these

402
00:46:49,635 --> 00:47:01,585
modern times, it's very difficult when you
are thinking of Christ and talking about Him.

403
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:12,774
It just, something shows that how people never
understood such a great man, such a great

404
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:13,774
personality.

405
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:17,655
And He was Divine, absolutely Divine; despite
that He made a drama, we should say, to go

406
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:19,984
through all the sufferings.

407
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:33,774
It's very painful, even to remember all that:
how He crucified Himself and how He died.

408
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:44,284
But the main point is this: He's done for
you, for all of you, and you are so indebted

409
00:47:44,284 --> 00:47:45,284
to Him.

410
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:56,885
It is His work which has helped the Kundalini
to be awakened and could pass through this

411
00:47:56,885 --> 00:47:59,254
fontanelle bone area.

412
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:05,515
All this would have been impossible without
the sacrifice of Christ.

413
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:15,534
You all should thus deserve to have some sacrifices.

414
00:48:15,534 --> 00:48:21,625
See, this is a very symbolic thing that has
happened.

415
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:32,705
And you all should be all the time prepared
to sacrifice whatever is possible, for the

416
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:35,305
emancipation of humanity.

417
00:48:35,305 --> 00:48:40,345
It's very, very subtle at this moment now.

418
00:48:40,345 --> 00:48:44,895
Forget about your seeking, forget about everything.

419
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:57,329
What is needed is that you have to remember
all the time that you are saved, you are being

420
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:01,599
blessed, by the sacrifices of Christ.

421
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,109
It's very important.

422
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:09,028
May God bless you all.
