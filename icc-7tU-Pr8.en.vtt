Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule, India
December 25, 2001

00:26:21.295 --> 00:26:31.101
Nice to see so many Sahaja yogis coming here

00:26:31.396 --> 00:26:35.030
during the Christmas Puja.

00:26:38.556 --> 00:26:42.901
Christianity has spread all over the world,

00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:48.764
and there are so many so-called Christians

00:26:49.078 --> 00:26:53.587
who say they follow Christ –

00:26:53.809 --> 00:26:58.653
I don’t know from which angle.

00:27:04.368 --> 00:27:09.023
Christ was the embodiment of Paramchaitanya.

00:27:09.303 --> 00:27:14.899
He was Omkara. He was Shri Ganesha.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:25.029
And those
who follow Him have to be very different people.

00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:32.047
But always happens in every religion

00:27:32.333 --> 00:27:42.016
that they go at random into the opposite direction,

00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:45.616
completely opposite.

00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:55.584
The essence of Christ’s life was detachment and sacrifice.

00:27:56.549 --> 00:28:04.260
For a person who is detached, there’s nothing like sacrifice.

00:28:04.468 --> 00:28:09.832
He sees his life as just a drama.

00:28:10.074 --> 00:28:14.554
Such a great personality came on this earth

00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:19.967
and created this so-called Christian religion,

00:28:20.372 --> 00:28:27.837
which has gone into wars, all kinds of hypocritical thing,

00:28:28.258 --> 00:28:33.297
and now the people are discovering about it.

00:28:34.936 --> 00:28:43.856
He stood for truth, and Christians don’t know what is the truth is.

00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:50.652
The truth is that you are the spirit,

00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:54.786
and you have to become the spirit.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:03.611
He’s the one who has talked about second birth, of realization.

00:29:05.418 --> 00:29:11.671
But they have forgotten about what He said,
what they have to achieve.

00:29:12.215 --> 00:29:19.215
It’s such a funny thing that all these great people came on this Earth

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:26.694
and created a proper religion for our ascent,

00:29:26.893 --> 00:29:33.886
and I don’t know how people have become so stupid

00:29:34.357 --> 00:29:44.902
with the teachings of the so-called, their masters.

00:29:46.464 --> 00:29:56.383
It’s all money-oriented.
Apart from that, it’s not standing on the truth.

00:29:57.836 --> 00:30:05.793
I think this is the second crucifixion of this religion.

00:30:06.651 --> 00:30:20.098
There’s no religion which is following really
their principles as been described.

00:30:21.003 --> 00:30:28.003
I don’t know how they manage to twist the truth in this manner,

00:30:28.252 --> 00:30:34.154
just to make some money or some fuss.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:41.530
Such a ritualistic stuff is going on in the name of Christ.

00:30:44.712 --> 00:30:53.022
Though they have faltered so many times and they had experience

00:30:53.233 --> 00:31:02.790
of such a bad influence on the world, to reaction

00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:13.307
we don’t know why such a roundabout things come up,

00:31:14.053 --> 00:31:20.139
and people accept it, they just accept.

00:31:20.385 --> 00:31:23.017
You take any religion.

00:31:23.646 --> 00:31:30.646
These days, Islam is talking, I don’t know of what.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:37.414
There are two important things in the life of Mohammed Sahib.

00:31:37.993 --> 00:31:43.094
The first one is called as miraj

00:31:43.282 --> 00:31:49.052
which is nothing but the awakening of the kundalini, absolutely clearly.

00:31:49.427 --> 00:31:55.049
And the second one He has talked about is jihad.

00:31:55.533 --> 00:32:05.683
“Jihad” means killing your bad things, killing your bad nature,

00:32:06.206 --> 00:32:09.404
killing all the shadripus within you.

00:32:09.944 --> 00:32:14.348
It doesn’t mean that you become a Muslim and kill yourself.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.705
It’s the stupidest thing to do.

00:32:17.864 --> 00:32:26.569
Did you become Mussulman just to kill yourself and commit suicide?

00:32:28.853 --> 00:32:35.418
Calling it as a ritual, they are saying

00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:41.012
that by this you will go to Cennet, into the Heavens.

00:32:41.539 --> 00:32:48.798
How can you go? As Muslims they are not religious – not at all.

00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:58.477
And then by killing, these sinful people, how will you go

00:32:59.001 --> 00:33:04.666
to the Heavens where you’d have enjoyment of Cennet?

00:33:04.921 --> 00:33:14.323
There’s no reasoning.
But all these maullanas first of all have finished their education –

00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:29.936
have finished their education.
They do not educate themselves at all.

00:33:30.349 --> 00:33:37.690
So they have no idea in this world where are they standing,
what is their position.

00:33:38.533 --> 00:33:44.899
Some few are educated, but they are also lost

00:33:45.043 --> 00:33:49.725
with the idea of having power on these people.

00:33:50.555 --> 00:33:59.093
It’s such a shameful thing to do in the name of God
and in the name of spirituality.

00:34:07.995 --> 00:34:13.119
Now, our duty is to tell them what is the truth.

00:34:13.771 --> 00:34:20.649
Our duty is, bring them to the proper path of spirituality,

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:26.903
because they are all lost.
Christians are lost, Muslim are lost,

00:34:27.033 --> 00:34:32.083
Hindus are lost; all of them are lost people.

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:37.987
They have no idea as to what their religion professed

00:34:38.106 --> 00:34:41.713
and what they are supposed to do.

00:34:43.237 --> 00:34:47.321
Ultimately Christ was crucified,

00:34:47.763 --> 00:34:53.113
so you can see how when there was truth,

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:58.498
untruth tried to finish it off; they couldn’t bear it.

00:34:58.984 --> 00:35:02.537
We have example of Socrates.

00:35:02.735 --> 00:35:07.335
What was the need to kill him? But they killed him.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:15.201
In this way, so far, we know in the past all

00:35:15.376 --> 00:35:22.547
the people who are pivotal for the truth are being finished,

00:35:23.436 --> 00:35:26.659
because they don’t want the truth.

00:35:26.955 --> 00:35:33.955
They are following some religion
because they can have power over other people:

00:35:34.167 --> 00:35:37.653
religion that they have made.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:50.169
Miraj is a kundalini awakening, and they say that miraj will never take place.

00:35:50.887 --> 00:35:54.989
Very good! So many of you have got realization.

00:35:56.408 --> 00:36:02.798
You have got your vibrations and cool breeze,

00:36:02.864 --> 00:36:07.007
which is described in Koran,

00:36:07.635 --> 00:36:14.187
that you should feel the cool breeze.
But who can tell the Muslims?

00:36:14.512 --> 00:36:18.994
You talk something – they’ll come and cut your throat, that’s all.

00:36:19.233 --> 00:36:26.046
You will go to jihad.
So it’s such a stupid thing they are doing,

00:36:26.681 --> 00:36:30.781
and in these modern times as we see,

00:36:31.116 --> 00:36:44.228
people have crossed all the maryadas, all the things of a religion.

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:54.776
Before I went to America, and I was surprised
how they have forgotten of our morality.

00:36:55.054 --> 00:37:03.436
They have no sense of morality.
And they are selling it in the market, making money out of it.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:12.398
On the contrary, these Muslims – specially there is a class called Vahhabis –

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:18.369
these people are saying that women are the one

00:37:18.555 --> 00:37:27.637
who spoil your morality, and so hide them,
they should be covered.

00:37:28.016 --> 00:37:33.622
Any woman who was wearing white chappels in Afghanistan,

00:37:33.717 --> 00:37:38.825
they were beating her. “Kill them.”

00:37:40.674 --> 00:37:47.665
And so many people in India,
specially in north, have taken to Islamic culture,

00:37:47.888 --> 00:37:52.220
and they really ill-treat women in the north.

00:37:52.371 --> 00:38:00.377
I was married in the north,
and I know how they have been unkind to women.

00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:05.227
So north of India is already contaminated by this,

00:38:05.402 --> 00:38:12.373
and the south is contaminated by the fanatic Hindus.

00:38:13.095 --> 00:38:25.286
All kinds of rituals, worst type,
bestowed upon only on women, are followed in the south.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:33.680
They will shave the head of a woman, make her go round a temple,

00:38:33.925 --> 00:38:42.708
pour water on her and she is just tumbling around, she is not walking,

00:38:42.959 --> 00:38:48.507
and they go on putting water on her – I’ve seen it Myself.

00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:56.895
We have sati, is of the killing of the women after the death of their husband.

00:38:57.264 --> 00:39:01.341
This is something no one can understand.

00:39:01.436 --> 00:39:08.201
Why put all the dharma on women, and why not on the men?

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:16.290
But one thing good, that Hindu religion has now become so much out-of-date

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:22.948
that you can correct all these things.
So many things have been corrected in My own lifetime.

00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:32.282
I was surprised, how could they do it?
But in Muslims and Islamism you cannot correct them.

00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:42.610
Such horrible things they do to their women,
and whenever you try to help them, it’s impossible.

00:39:42.819 --> 00:39:49.819
For example, I started a place for the women who are

00:39:50.003 --> 00:39:55.680
left out in world alone, who are like orphans, who have children.

00:39:55.885 --> 00:40:02.885
I was surprised, most of them are Muslims,
and they have eight to ten children each.

00:40:03.227 --> 00:40:11.618
So now we have to make an orphanage also.
This is what they are producing out of their religion.

00:40:12.265 --> 00:40:15.370
You can see this around you.

00:40:15.576 --> 00:40:21.587
Even Hindus have a funny system of widowhood.

00:40:21.784 --> 00:40:25.468
If they make a woman widow, it’s terrible,

00:40:25.724 --> 00:40:32.724
and they are poor things, some of them; and quite a lot of them are living in Vrindavan.

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:40.359
I was told that they get one rupee per day.

00:40:40.968 --> 00:40:43.949
And what do they do? They sing bhajans.

00:40:44.044 --> 00:40:48.786
In one rupee, how can you live in this country?

00:40:49.803 --> 00:40:56.526
They are good at creating so many beggars and beggar-women.

00:40:57.804 --> 00:41:04.634
If that is the religion, better not have it.
We have had enough of this.

00:41:05.447 --> 00:41:11.130
All kinds of ritualism through this Brahmanism.

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:16.069
These  brahmins are absolutely good-for-nothing people.

00:41:16.336 --> 00:41:23.336
Those who try to teach religion have to be something of a great level.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.924
So in Sahaja Yoga you give up everything,

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:39.400
because this is all nothing but mud,
and in the mud you will be finished.

00:41:40.844 --> 00:41:46.536
You have to tell people about it.
What are they going to do?

00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:55.390
They have misused the religion for all kinds of bad thing.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:05.014
Like in England if somebody dies, they must have champagne.

00:42:06.115 --> 00:42:11.178
When they go for the burial they must have champagne.

00:42:11.747 --> 00:42:17.863
I was surprised: how is it they are going to have champagne for this?

00:42:18.245 --> 00:42:25.710
And how is it, out of religion you say, all their priests also drink? – no question.

00:42:28.425 --> 00:42:32.240
One priest came to Sahaja Yoga, I was very happy.

00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:37.387
But he said, “I’ll come to Sahaj, but I will not give up drinking.”

00:42:37.484 --> 00:42:38.967
I said, “Why?”

00:42:39.068 --> 00:42:43.279
“Because it’s written in the Bible that you must drink.”
Accha! I didn’t know.

00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:50.478
How could it be? How could Christ say that you should drink?

00:42:50.842 --> 00:42:57.654
He was not only a realized Self, but He was Realization Himself.”

00:42:57.852 --> 00:43:03.514
He said, “He has said it. Whatever You may say, He has said it.”

00:43:03.963 --> 00:43:05.370
“Where?”

00:43:05.473 --> 00:43:09.247
He said, “He went to one wedding. All right.

00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:16.083
In that wedding, He made wine for the people.”
But He did not.

00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:24.322
He went there, and in such a short time
He just put His hand in the water

00:43:24.487 --> 00:43:31.487
and it started tasting like grape juice.

00:43:31.641 --> 00:43:35.845
And grape juice has the same word “wine” in Hebrew language.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:41.914
I said, “I can do that. That doesn’t mean I like people to drink.”

00:43:41.962 --> 00:43:47.547
I mean, who can say such a nonsense?

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:57.100
It is awareness which is important, chetana is important.

00:43:57.473 --> 00:44:04.832
And if you spoil your awareness, how can you be Sahaja yogis?

00:44:06.434 --> 00:44:12.256
It was impossible to tell them that you cannot drink.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:17.206
But drinking even in India has become very common.

00:44:17.437 --> 00:44:26.915
It is all against Christianity, it’s against Hinduism, against Islam.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:35.407
And though it is written down in Koran
“Don’t drink,” they drink, they all drink.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:41.960
And instead of following the religion,
they have become the greatest sinner.

00:44:42.122 --> 00:44:47.458
Is that what Christ wanted them to do?

00:44:50.194 --> 00:44:57.192
You have to be pure people. Nirmala tattwam you must have.

00:44:57.472 --> 00:45:04.588
That’s what it is. Also I told you a story about Shalivahana,

00:45:04.723 --> 00:45:09.926
who met Christ in Kashmir.

00:45:10.437 --> 00:45:15.493
And he asked Christ about His name
and His country. He says,

00:45:15.605 --> 00:45:19.789
“I come from a country where people are malecch.”

00:45:20.003 --> 00:45:28.699
“Malecch” means those who have a desire for mala, for filth.

00:45:29.817 --> 00:45:37.064
So he told Him, “Why don’t You go
and teach them Nirmala tattwam?” Shalivahana said.

00:45:37.262 --> 00:45:41.145
That is what Nirmal tattwam you have got,

00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:54.180
which purifies you, which cleanses you,
which gives you joy, happiness and the truth.

00:45:54.453 --> 00:45:58.669
This is what you should ask for.

00:46:00.087 --> 00:46:04.748
Otherwise it’s all darkness, you don’t see the light.

00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:10.816
Whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anyone,

00:46:11.204 --> 00:46:18.204
you cannot see light of truth; and you have to take the light of truth.

00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:24.872
But after that, what you have to do?

00:46:25.078 --> 00:46:30.186
You have to give it to others, you have to transform others.

00:46:30.406 --> 00:46:36.559
You have worked very hard for it. And sometimes I am surprised

00:46:36.651 --> 00:46:45.828
how people who are doing such a good work are so humble and so good.

00:46:47.022 --> 00:46:51.858
How have they achieved it, I can’t understand.

00:46:52.551 --> 00:47:00.569
Of course there are some who are money-oriented,
who are power-oriented,

00:47:00.767 --> 00:47:04.133
but these things do not give joy.

00:47:04.228 --> 00:47:15.425
What gives joy is your inner light of truth

00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:19.541
which you have, all of you have, as you know.

00:47:19.716 --> 00:47:28.057
You all have experienced.
But I would say this experience has to be given to others –

00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:34.946
it’s not only for you – given to as many people possible.

00:47:35.104 --> 00:47:40.855
But how many do that? How many people do that?

00:47:41.293 --> 00:47:47.870
We have also Sikh community. They came to Sahaj,

00:47:48.089 --> 00:47:53.188
but they said, “We cannot worship Goddess.”
I said, “Why?”

00:47:53.366 --> 00:48:04.992
Surprised at it,
because Shri Guru Nanak has talked about the Goddess, the Devi.

00:48:05.269 --> 00:48:15.885
The first sentence of His book is “Adya.”
“Adya” is the Adi Shakti.

00:48:17.863 --> 00:48:26.413
And for this if the Sikhs stupidly say,
then why do they have a Chandigarh?

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:34.747
They’re so stupid also, nothing to really compare.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:41.809
Now, you have to understand, have you given up all that nonsense or not in your lives,

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:48.809
or are you all sticking onto the same? That is very important.

00:48:49.045 --> 00:48:56.254
As long as you are sticking onto the same, there will be a problem.

00:48:56.492 --> 00:49:01.077
Sahaja Yoga does so much. I was surprised,

00:49:01.264 --> 00:49:06.978
in America there are three hundred Sahaja yogis,
nothing happened to them.

00:49:07.242 --> 00:49:18.420
Some were on the tower, some were on the street,
all of them were there and nothing has happened to them.

00:49:18.712 --> 00:49:22.497
Some of them said that “Somebody told us inside,

00:49:24.084 --> 00:49:31.289
told us inside that ‘run away’ and we started running in the other direction.

00:49:31.618 --> 00:49:36.844
” Some were delayed; I don’t know how, all these three hundreds.

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:52.206
But such a devil of these people who are thinking of destroying
the whole world are coming round.

00:49:52.429 --> 00:49:58.893
This is the reason I went to America, and I told them that this war will be over

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:06.178
before Diwali, and it ended; before Diwali this war will be over, and it ended.

00:50:06.432 --> 00:50:13.432
What a stupid thing to think they can destroy the creation of God like this.

00:50:13.606 --> 00:50:21.190
Who are they? How have they got the right to destroy the world?

00:50:22.911 --> 00:50:27.920
But that is what is a human nonsense.

00:50:28.623 --> 00:50:34.016
Christ came on this Earth, He worked for a long time

00:50:34.183 --> 00:50:38.863
and He was to be crucified, so He got crucified.

00:50:39.189 --> 00:50:45.321
But crucifixion is not our glory. Our glory is His resurrection.

00:50:46.377 --> 00:50:51.702
That  was resurrected, no doubt.

00:50:51.909 --> 00:50:57.906
To say that it’s not possible and all that – who are you to say that?

00:50:58.136 --> 00:51:04.413
What do you know about spirituality?
What do you know what can happen to a person

00:51:04.548 --> 00:51:11.509
who is spiritual, spiritually equipped, what can work out in Him?

00:51:11.647 --> 00:51:18.728
Whatever we know about human beings,
we try to draw conclusions which are all wrong.

00:51:18.992 --> 00:51:22.397
See in your life.

00:51:23.048 --> 00:51:27.945
There are so many miracles in the lives of Sahaja yogis,

00:51:28.082 --> 00:51:32.603
and they – I told somebody that “You’d better compile them.”

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:40.119
So he said, “Within one month all those letters have come up to my head.”
In one month!

00:51:40.235 --> 00:51:43.354
I said, “Forget it, don’t write.”

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:49.181
It’s not one or two; from all over the world people are writing.

00:51:49.981 --> 00:51:56.981
But those who are intellectuals are very difficult.

00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:04.059
It’s impossible to put this into their heads.

00:52:04.476 --> 00:52:09.198
So whatever is possible, we have to do our maximum,

00:52:09.429 --> 00:52:12.794
put our attention to people who want it.

00:52:12.917 --> 00:52:21.817
Now in India it has gone to into jails,
it has gone into schools and everywhere.

00:52:21.976 --> 00:52:26.542
And somebody told Me the other day that even in a Catholic church

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.856
they have started taking to Sahaja Yoga;

00:52:30.039 --> 00:52:35.088
I don’t know what’s wrong in their heads and how they have managed.

00:52:35.201 --> 00:52:42.201
But that’s how Sahaja Yoga is spreading. But it has to spread much more.

00:52:42.422 --> 00:52:48.260
You have to, all of you individually should go round and work it out,

00:52:48.604 --> 00:52:53.281
and talk about it. But Sahaja yogis are little shy.

00:52:54.556 --> 00:53:01.452
Once I was going by plane, and one lady was very, very hot.

00:53:01.768 --> 00:53:07.393
So I asked her what guru she follows, she told Me the name.

00:53:07.664 --> 00:53:13.729
I was surprised that she didn’t know anything about spirituality.

00:53:14.522 --> 00:53:21.522
And these people have huge houses and big temples, everything,

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:28.152
and she was telling Me the praise of her guru.
I thought, “She is very shameless.

00:53:28.237 --> 00:53:34.532
She hasn’t got anything in her, she’s so very hot,
and she’s talking about it.”

00:53:34.771 --> 00:53:40.206
But Sahaja yogis won’t. I was surprised,
why Sahaja yogis don’t talk about it?

00:53:40.768 --> 00:53:45.662
But the other day I had gone with somebody in the market

00:53:46.142 --> 00:53:49.501
and I had a Sahaja yogi with him, and I was surprised,

00:53:49.603 --> 00:53:56.078
he started telling them about Me, and he started giving them realization.

00:53:56.244 --> 00:54:02.555
And they were very happy about it. Everywhere you go you have neighbors,

00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:09.698
you go to markets, everywhere you should go and talk about it.

00:54:11.049 --> 00:54:16.519
Like they sing these carols – we should also have bhajans and things

00:54:16.658 --> 00:54:20.549
to tell other people, we have to tell them.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:27.008
Why are you so shy? This shyness is not going to help Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:28.137 --> 00:54:33.221
So please see that you try to give realizations to others.

00:54:33.347 --> 00:54:38.766
You have powers; have faith in yourself.
I think they lack in faith

00:54:39.052 --> 00:54:44.533
or whatever it is, there are very few people who come out and do it.

00:54:44.842 --> 00:54:51.003
Italy I have seen, and also Austria, Australia;

00:54:51.122 --> 00:54:57.016
Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot because of their conviction

00:54:57.339 --> 00:55:03.285
that we have to give others what we have. We have to share it.

00:55:03.539 --> 00:55:10.014
From the life of Christ one has to understand His sacrifice.

00:55:11.002 --> 00:55:18.949
It’s such a lot of sacrifice – to be crucified like that, with the thieves.

00:55:19.298 --> 00:55:25.023
But He did it. In the same way when you all people

00:55:25.182 --> 00:55:32.237
want to do Sahaja Yoga work, you shouldn’t think, “What will happen to my grandfather,

00:55:32.305 --> 00:55:39.793
what will happen to my grandmother?” I mean, whatever letters I get are all about this.

00:55:40.014 --> 00:55:44.733
It’s very funny. They are only worried about some relations,

00:55:44.843 --> 00:55:48.802
they are not worried about the relations all over the world even.

00:55:48.937 --> 00:55:54.495
Worried about the wife or children: I get only letters like this.

00:55:54.715 --> 00:55:59.045
Nobody writes to Me that you have given realizations to so many.

00:55:59.211 --> 00:56:09.775
They never write how they have been able to achieve
spreading of Sahaja Yoga. o one writes – very surprising.

00:56:10.065 --> 00:56:12.864
You have to tell Me.

00:56:12.976 --> 00:56:21.053
I hope you all people understand the importance of spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:26.391
If you don’t do that, you are absolutely useless.

00:56:26.598 --> 00:56:31.617
The greatest thing for Me, as you have so many lights here,

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.400
we should have many more Sahaja yogis all over the world.

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:42.485
If you want to change this world and if you want to avoid all the

00:56:42.621 --> 00:56:50.222
trials and tribulations of the useless life they are leading,
you have to save them.

00:56:50.397 --> 00:56:54.966
You have to salvage them. That’s your job,

00:56:55.078 --> 00:57:02.078
that’s what you have to pay for Sahaja Yoga –
not for yourself, not for yourself.

00:57:02.388 --> 00:57:11.020
Don’t get worried about yourself. If you read the letters I get, you’ll get disgusted.

00:57:23.885 --> 00:57:33.946
Now, some other kind of letters I get, that they want to marry – all right.

00:57:34.411 --> 00:57:41.074
There are many girls who claim that
“We have been applying for four years, we couldn’t get married.”

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:47.031
Firstly you must know, out of proportion women are there.
They are very good.

00:57:47.221 --> 00:57:49.467
Say, if there are forty boys,

00:57:49.594 --> 00:57:55.400
there would be at least a hundred-and-twenty,
or maybe even a hundred -and-fifty girls.

00:57:55.607 --> 00:58:00.733
So now, whom should we marry those girls? Just think of it.

00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:06.329
But they write letters of complaint that
“We have applied four times.”

00:58:06.582 --> 00:58:12.444
We can’t, we can’t help it.
So you go outside, marry anywhere you feel like.

00:58:12.566 --> 00:58:18.214
Or else you wait and see, and dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:18.358 --> 00:58:22.672
It’s a very difficult thing when they go on complaining

00:58:22.834 --> 00:58:28.120
that “I should be married, and I haven’t got married as yet.”

00:58:28.384 --> 00:58:31.712
Marriage was never our idea.

00:58:31.839 --> 00:58:35.551
But then we had to allow marriages.

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:39.992
And now it has become the main issue with everyone.

00:58:40.223 --> 00:58:47.157
Either they are not married;
if they are married, they are not happy;

00:58:47.498 --> 00:58:51.375
if they are divorced, they must be married again.

00:58:51.598 --> 00:58:57.162
All sorts of things and complications, for which I am not prepared.

00:58:57.337 --> 00:59:00.055
Sahaja Yoga is not for that.

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:05.939
If your marriage is not successful, it’s not My job.

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:11.397
And if goes on, we’ll have to stop marriages.

00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:16.714
I don’t want you to write all these things to Me.

00:59:16.842 --> 00:59:23.008
It shows how poor you are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:23.871 --> 00:59:29.592
Why not write to Me how many people you have given realization?

00:59:29.977 --> 00:59:33.868
That will make Me happy;

00:59:34.289 --> 00:59:40.876
instead of complaining about your wife and – that’s not My concern.

00:59:41.836 --> 00:59:47.643
And as it came, we have married you; if you cannot carry on, it’s your duty.

00:59:49.727 --> 00:59:56.767
And this is what is the snag of Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:04.709
In every religious movement there have been so many wrong things,

01:00:05.106 --> 01:00:12.217
while in Sahaja Yoga I think marriages is a very big hurdle.

01:00:12.519 --> 01:00:18.487
Moreover, boys don’t come;
because in India, very easy to marry boys,

01:00:18.653 --> 01:00:26.438
you can also get money, this, that.
But girls, there are five times more than the boys.

01:00:26.732 --> 01:00:32.657
Boys don’t want to marry. They’ll have their own marriages,
though they are Sahaja yogis.

01:00:33.836 --> 01:00:41.123
So I can’t understand why, in Sahaja Yoga also after coming to realization,

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:46.511
to them marriage is a very important issue.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:53.710
What is most important is that how many people you give realization.

01:00:55.326 --> 01:00:58.376
That is your life.

01:00:59.837 --> 01:01:05.981
If a lotus is there it will open, but it must give fragrance.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:11.114
Even the lotus has a responsibility.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:17.803
Then what about you people? I’m not saying you get crucified like Christ – no.

01:01:18.039 --> 01:01:26.121
I said you enjoy your life, you have peace and stability, balance.

01:01:26.288 --> 01:01:33.502
But at the same time you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:39.969
This is what is your job now. Your job is not important;

01:01:40.437 --> 01:01:46.143
only this is important, how many people you give realization.

01:01:46.389 --> 01:01:52.134
It’s very, very difficult, because they have made

01:01:52.348 --> 01:02:00.133
a mess of all the great incarnations, all those great Sufis and saints.

01:02:00.252 --> 01:02:04.370
But at least you people don’t do that.

01:02:04.478 --> 01:02:12.171
So please try to think whom can you give realization,
to whom you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:12.668 --> 01:02:14.659
You have to spread out.

01:02:14.834 --> 01:02:20.666
And next time I hope, I hear from you how
many people you have given realization.

01:02:20.864 --> 01:02:28.940
That is the greatest justification for the crucifixion of Christ,

01:02:29.442 --> 01:02:33.806
for His birth, for His coming on this earth, His Agnya.

01:02:34.076 --> 01:02:37.959
And if you have given realization, they have crossed the Agnya,

01:02:38.311 --> 01:02:44.089
they have gone beyond, and they are in Sahasrara.

01:02:44.752 --> 01:02:50.602
So in Sahaja Yoga you understand everything. It’s very easy to understand.

01:02:50.785 --> 01:02:56.732
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest thing to understand – but after realization.

01:02:56.899 --> 01:03:04.549
So you have to go round and see
how many people you can give realization.

01:03:05.961 --> 01:03:14.092
Everything is all right, all your worshipping is all right,
your puja is all right;

01:03:14.513 --> 01:03:22.028
but what is most important is
how many people you have given realization.

01:03:22.448 --> 01:03:27.272
I would like to know how many people have given.

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:34.788
And specially with ladies. Ladies are rather weak in giving realization.

01:03:34.923 --> 01:03:39.152
They can do a lot, I know, they can.

01:03:39.327 --> 01:03:47.058
After all, I am also a woman. But somehow I find the ladies in Sahaja Yoga

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:54.524
are not of a level. They can do a lot, a lot,

01:03:54.692 --> 01:03:59.881
but somehow they don’t understand the importance of their life.

01:04:00.111 --> 01:04:03.309
You are very important.

01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:08.239
How many people there are who have got realizations?

01:04:08.787 --> 01:04:17.221
There were so many Sufis who got realization, they write poetry – finished.

01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:23.895
There were so many saints who did so much, wrote so many things.

01:04:25.527 --> 01:04:32.437
In India we had so many saints; they wrote all these things, people will read them,

01:04:32.796 --> 01:04:40.605
but nothing happens. You have, you have the art of giving realization.

01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:44.658
You know about kundalini, you know all about it.

01:04:44.777 --> 01:04:48.670
Go ahead and talk to people.

01:04:48.794 --> 01:04:57.565
I was alone when I started Sahaja Yoga, and I am a woman.

01:04:57.746 --> 01:05:02.766
So what about you? There’s a now challenge for all of you.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:05.832
How many people have you made Sahaja yogis?

01:05:05.994 --> 01:05:12.242
Even in your family people are not Sahaja yogis,
your daughter is not, your son is not.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:18.074
So what’s the use of singing glory to Christ?

01:05:18.603 --> 01:05:26.171
If you are singing glory to Him,
you must make people cross their Agnya.

01:05:27.179 --> 01:05:32.764
He’s so highly placed within us, but you have never respected Him,

01:05:33.124 --> 01:05:40.325
that such a highly placed personality you have crossed over,
so why not others?

01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:48.226
Let us see from today’s Puja

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.750
how much determination you have.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:06:01.175
You should know that a Goddess doesn’t come with your own demands,

01:06:01.362 --> 01:06:06.695
She comes on Her own. She has Her own timing.

01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:12.394
But if you are people in majority

01:06:12.577 --> 01:06:19.550
who have really become saints and making others saintly, then I am for you.

01:06:19.716 --> 01:06:22.087
Otherwise I am available to you:

01:06:22.238 --> 01:06:26.312
you can have My vibrations, you can have My pujas,

01:06:26.521 --> 01:06:29.626
all these things are permitted, no doubt.

01:06:29.746 --> 01:06:37.409
But for that you are only capable,

01:06:37.591 --> 01:06:43.115
you are only entitled for that if you are doing Sahaja Yoga,

01:06:43.235 --> 01:06:48.382
if you are spreading Sahaja Yoga,
if you are giving to others;

01:06:48.865 --> 01:06:54.857
then only you will be considered really

01:06:55.134 --> 01:07:01.446
capable of receiving the vibrations of the Goddess.

01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:07.611
In some countries if it is so much powerful,

01:07:07.739 --> 01:07:12.196
why not with your country, with your neighborhood,

01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:17.556
with your friends, with your relations is possible?

01:07:19.574 --> 01:07:22.875
So tonight you have to decide

01:07:23.013 --> 01:07:29.395
that you are going to dedicate yourself in giving it to others –

01:07:29.554 --> 01:07:34.749
it’s very joy-giving – and talking about Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:35.254 --> 01:07:37.455
May God bless you.
