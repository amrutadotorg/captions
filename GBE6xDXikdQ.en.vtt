00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:19.901
We have within us a being which I call ‘the Spirit’:

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:27.507
the Spirit which is also the part and parcel

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:33.928
of the totality that is love, totality that is God,

00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:42.414
totality that is joy, totality that is knowledge.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:47.727
And that Spirit within us is watching us.

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:56.885
It is not watching like a guard or a police inspector.

00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:02.218
That also we human beings cannot understand.

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:07.405
If I say the Spirit is watching, people get a fright, “Oh God!”

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:16.158
The Spirit is the one that is love.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:20.379
Can you understand total love?

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.043
Can you understand something that just gives and enjoys giving,

00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:30.443
and not asking for anything?

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:34.856
Can you understand someone like that?
Can you?

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.336
Loving for love’s sake; that’s what is your Spirit.

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:50.323
It is watching you with that love, that total love.

00:01:54.636 --> 00:02:07.950
That totality of love is watching you to give you that what it is.

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:19.501
Now here, I would say, you are the Spirit 
and you are this self, another one,

00:02:19.582 --> 00:02:24.201
which is this awareness, this human awareness which you have got.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:37.315
This human awareness has to be enlightened by that totality, that Spirit.

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:46.308
When it enlightens that, then only,

00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:50.721
you know that you are a part and parcel of the totality

00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:55.935
and that you are beautiful; you are really beautiful.

00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:02.863
Sometimes one feels a little bashful to know how beautiful one is,

00:03:02.944 --> 00:03:08.863
and so fragrant, and so grand and so dignified.

00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:16.588
That new dimension one has to achieve.

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:23.599
For that, God has placed within you the power,

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:28.512
which is the germinating power which has to rise

00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:34.159
and to give you this Realisation: this is your Kundalini.

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:45.972
About this in the Bible there is [a] reference of “Tree of Life."

00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:56.449
To be nourished by the “water of love."

00:03:56.658 --> 00:04:00.327
This is all prophesised.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:06.563
That, “He will appear before us as tongues of flames."
