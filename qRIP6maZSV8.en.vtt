00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.986
On today’s auspicious occasion, in a pleasant environment, such a beautiful subject – seems that many coincidences have come together.

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:32.910
Till date nobody suggested me to speak on the subject of worship but it is so important.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:43.052
Especially in this land of Yoga (Yogabhumi), in our land of Bharat (India), especially in this holy land of Maharashtra,

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:47.301
the Goddess of nature has come up with the creation of Ashtavinayakas,

00:00:47.301 --> 00:01:00.436
so what is the greatness of Ganesha, what is the importance of Ashtavinayakas etc is not known to many people.

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:04.476
I am very surprised at this.

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:16.446
Perhaps the people who understood everything, who knew everything –

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:26.109
those great ascetics and saints of our holy land – they must not have been given the liberty to express,

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.504
or may be nobody listened to them.

00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:38.147
Any amount of explanation about this will be inadequate and even seven lectures instead of one would be insufficient for me to speak about Shri Ganesha.

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:45.653
Today’s auspicious day is that of ‘Ghata Pujan’.  Ghatasthapna is primordial.

00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:50.900
When this universe was created, many times.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.415
The universe has not been created only once but many times.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:02:01.097
When this universe was created, first they installed the Ghata (container).

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:04.797
What do you mean by Ghata? One needs to understand this very deeply.

00:02:04.797 --> 00:02:12.163
Firstly, the Almighty resides in the state of Bramhatatva,(universal element or principle).

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:19.596
We will call it entropy in English.   When there is no movement in this state,

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:33.103
when the desire originates in this state or when the Almighty fancies desire then this desire gets established in HIM that    something new must be created in this world.

00:02:33.103 --> 00:02:36.373
Why does He get this desire? It is His desire.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:41.058
To understand why the Almighty has this desire is beyond the understanding of the human being.

00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:43.697
Likewise there are many things beyond the general comprehension of a human being.

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:50.888
But as we take them for granted similarly we must accept that that God’s wish is His own hobby.

00:02:50.888 --> 00:02:54.575
It’s His desire,  He does whatever He wants to do.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:03:01.147
This desire gets merged in Him and again gets awakened.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:03.797
Like a person sleeps off and again awakens.

00:03:03.797 --> 00:03:10.228
After sleeping even if his desires are dormant and are with him, they get activated only when he wakes up.

00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:12.831
It is same thing with God Almighty.

00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:23.916
When He has a desire to create nature then all these waves of creation of the universe, of the desire or what we can call as waves or ripples get collected.

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:29.464
And after accumulation, the ghat in which they get filled in – this is that ghat( container) .

00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:32.498
It is the will power of God Almighty itself.

00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:38.347
If we separate the God Almighty and his Will Power, and if we can understand it that way.

00:03:38.347 --> 00:03:40.726
It is same with us. We and our will power are different.

00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:43.776
This power takes birth first.

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:49.534
Till the time you desire something, till then that thing and its realization does not happen.

00:03:49.534 --> 00:03:54.969
This beautiful enormous world of ours, this too is a result of somebody’s desire.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:05.046
Everything gets activated only after we wish it and to activate God’s desire, we need to separate it from HIM.

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:08.367
If it remains included in the God Almighty, then it remains dormant.

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:16.292
When it starts its work by separating from HIM, we call it as “Adishakti” .

00:04:16.292 --> 00:04:21.615
When this initial state came, then Ghatasthapana happened.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.075
This has happened many times since time immemorial.

00:04:25.075 --> 00:04:35.291
And today also when we do Ghatasthapana, we remember that eternal infinite process.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.625
Means during this time (Navratra first day) we do the Ghatasthpana. So keep in mind what a great event this is.

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:47.551
That time what the God Almighty desired, before activating it He collected it.

00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:54.202
This was placed in a Ghat (container), the same desire today is being worshipped by us.

00:04:54.202 --> 00:04:56.226
We worshipped it today.

00:04:56.226 --> 00:05:08.293
God Almighty desired it. He made us part of humanity today. He helped us reach this great state. Hence it is our prime duty to bow to His desire.

00:05:08.293 --> 00:05:15.866
In the language of Sahaja Yoga, we call this as the desire of Mahakali or the power of Mahakali.

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:28.345
This is the power of Mahakali and these events that take place for nine days (specially in Maharashtra) these are about the various incarnations of this Mahakali.

00:05:28.345 --> 00:05:34.439
Even today, nothing can happen before the power of Mahakali or the power of pure desire.

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.723
Hence the power of pure desire is the beginning and the end also transpires in it.

00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:42.880
First of all, everything emanates from the desire and at the end it merges in it.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:51.275
So this power of Shri Sadashiva ( Lord Shiva), is the Adi Shakti and it moves around as Mahakali Power within us.

00:05:51.275 --> 00:06:10.156
At this juncture if we consider it as the Supreme Power, if we consider it as the formulation of the Viraat ( infinite) , the power on the left which flows through our Ida Nadi and that power is known as power of Mahakali.

00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:14.327
This is more widespread in the humans.

00:06:14.327 --> 00:06:17.896
It is not as much in the animals.

00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:24.203
This power enters us from the right side of our head.

00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:35.353
Subsequently it moves along the left side to go below the triangular bone which is the position of Lord Ganesha and ends there.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:44.408
Means first and foremost, the power of Mahakali gave birth only to Shri Ganesh.

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:52.354
Then Shri Ganesha got established. Ganesh is the first deity that got established and similarly the situation of Ganesh is same as that of Mahakali.

00:06:52.354 --> 00:06:57.350
This is the seed and the whole world emanates from this seed and again gets merged with it.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.630
Similarly everything after emanating from the Ganesh element merges with Ganesh element itself.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.606
Whatever exists, Ganesh is the seed of that.

00:07:07.606 --> 00:07:12.500
Whatever appears in front of us, in action, in desire, Ganesh is the seed of it.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.704
That is why Ganesh is considered the foremost main deity.

00:07:16.704 --> 00:07:20.584
Not only that, without worshipping Shri Ganesh, we cannot do any work.

00:07:20.584 --> 00:07:28.310
Then they may be Shaiva( devotees who worship Shri Shiva), maybe Vaishnav( devotees who worship Shri Vishnu), may be devotees of Shri Bramha or anybody else – all of them first worship Shri Ganesha.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:34.845
The reason for this is that Shri Ganesh element was established by God Almighty as the first thing in this universe.

00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:40.783
The Ganesh principle is what we call as ‘abodhita’ or what we call as ‘innocence’ in English.

00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:44.299
This is a very subtle principle. We do not understand it.

00:07:44.299 --> 00:08:03.817
In childhood it exists in the children, everywhere we see its expression, its fragrance, wafting all over –  that is why small children are so lovable –  such  is the principle of “innocence’

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.407
It is present in Shri Ganesha.

00:08:04.407 --> 00:08:11.194
It is difficult for human beings to understand this that how can one deity encompass all these things?

00:08:11.194 --> 00:08:20.238
If we look at the sun we see it has the power to give light similarly Shri Ganesha has power of ‘innocence’ .

00:08:20.238 --> 00:08:48.719
{Shree Mataji instructs in marathi}

00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:58.955
This power of ‘innocence ‘ that the God Almighty has imbibed in us , we worship this power of innocence.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:02.717
And we should also be such innocent beings.

00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:09.634
Many people feel that being innocent means being ignorant.

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:19.948
The meaning behind ‘innocence’ is that just like a small child is innocent , he is naive –that naivety should come in us.

00:09:19.948 --> 00:09:23.683
We do not understand how great this principle is.

00:09:23.683 --> 00:09:28.753
Suppose a small child starts playing. Today’s kids do not have much naivety.

00:09:28.753 --> 00:09:35.422
We only are responsible  for that.  What else can we tell others.

00:09:35.422 --> 00:09:40.072
How are we following our religions. How deeply involved are we in our religions?

00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:46.530
How religious we make our children – it is dependant on that and must know this is the outcome of that.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:53.263
Now the presence of innocence in humans can be   identified by watching a child.

00:09:53.263 --> 00:09:57.296
A person may have it, however old he becomes, still he has that innocence.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:02.665
Like a small kid while playing can impersonate Shivaji, may build a fort, will do everything.

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:04.793
Then he will leave everything and go away.

00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:07.180
One must leave everything after doing it.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.500
One must leave everything and be detached  about it.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.496
One must not get entangled in something. Must have no involvement.

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:19.102
This is the typical behavior of children.

00:10:19.102 --> 00:10:22.120
If you give anything to any child, he will preserve it.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.777
Will preserve it for a long time. After some time he will have no feelings for it.

00:10:27.777 --> 00:10:30.870
If we take away  that thing  without letting him know, he will not feel anything about it.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.688
But there are some  things that a child may not leave which are very important to him.

00:10:35.688 --> 00:10:37.490
One of such things is his mother.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.537
He does not leave his mother. Rest any thing  of this   world you  take from him,it is alright with him –

00:10:41.537 --> 00:10:48.065
He does not understand wealth, he does not understand money, he does not understand education, he does not understand anything except his mother.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:54.972
This is my mother. She gave birth to me. She is everything for  me.

00:10:54.972 --> 00:10:58.677
He does not accord importance to anything other than his mother.

00:10:58.677 --> 00:11:03.194
Rabindranath Tagore has written a beautiful story.

00:11:03.194 --> 00:11:10.022
A  small child lost his way in the market place and people caught  him and asked him what he wants.’ He was continuously crying.

00:11:10.022 --> 00:11:16.551
They told him that they would give him this thing, give him horse, give him elephant. He said nothing doing , I want my mother.’

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:21.066
And he was continuously crying for his mother.He did not eat anything offered to him.

00:11:21.066 --> 00:11:25.900
Kept on crying the whole day. He became quiet only when he met his mother.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.238
All of us have this seed element in us from the childhood itself.

00:11:30.238 --> 00:11:37.119
We do not leave our mother. We know that this mother has given birth to us.

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:43.657
But in addition there is another mother within us that  the God almighty has given. And this mother is “Kundalini” .

00:11:43.657 --> 00:11:48.642
God almighty has curled up  Mother Kundalini and placed her in  our sacrum bone(triangular bone).

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:51.967
She is our mother and we are continuously searching her.

00:11:51.967 --> 00:12:03.206
In all our searches whether  political, social or educational – whatever your interests may be, behind all these interests you are searching your mother.

00:12:03.206 --> 00:12:10.189
This Mother Kundalini takes you to the ultimate position where you get complete satisfaction.

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:22.260
The search for this mother, the longing for this mother, which lies in us in a subtle form , which embraces us stays awakened due to the Ganesha principle.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.129
The person whose Ganesha element is destroyed completely he is not innocent.

00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:29.643
We observe many qualities in a person who is innocent.

00:12:29.643 --> 00:12:34.781
means he has chastity in his relations with his  mother, sister, and brother.

00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:46.703
During common interactions, social interactions, during worldly interactions God has defined one  spouse and all other people in this world –

00:12:46.703 --> 00:12:51.953
if we consider that  we have pure  relation with them as God Almighty has defined –

00:12:51.953 --> 00:12:57.498
if this is seen in your behavior  then it should be considered that the person has true innocence.

00:12:57.498 --> 00:13:03.941
This is his true attribute. The sign of innocence is that a person sees purity in all individuals.

00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:07.621
Reason is as he has purity within himself, he will not regard anyone as impure.

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:13.649
Here we don’t have to explain about chastity as people know what chastity is.

00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:17.758
In England or America we have to explain because their minds are confused.

00:13:17.758 --> 00:13:22.269
But you all are sensible. By grace of God in this land of India

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:29.742
say due to Ashtavinayakas or due to good deeds from your previous lives or due to the service rendered by our gurus and saints ,

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:35.282
this is one land on this earth where holiness still prevails.

00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:40.349
It is a very great thing and you have organized the puja (worship) of this holiness.

00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:46.622
So while doing puja, you must pay attention to whether you have that holiness or not.

00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:53.693
In our Sahaja Yoga those who do not have Ganesh element they do not have the purity. He is of no use to us.

00:13:53.693 --> 00:13:59.079
We do not pay attention to such a person. But there is no way to tell upfront that you have lost this holy attribute.

00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:07.748
Even though we know all this , we cannot tell this – because this Ganapati who is installed there, he is the son of Gauri.

00:14:07.748 --> 00:14:13.870
And Gauri means the power of Kundalini  which encompasses us,  this is the power of  Gauri.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.843
Today there is Gauri Pujan(worship) and Ganesh Pujan – we must realize what a significant day it is.

00:14:19.843 --> 00:14:26.893
The Ganesh element present in us tells Gauri whether this person is alright or not.

00:14:26.893 --> 00:14:30.652
Means one must appreciate the good arrangement that is made.

00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:33.127
Means the two nadis coming from the top, Ida and Pingla…

00:14:33.127 --> 00:14:39.284
Now if you have not read about Sahaja Yoga at all then it will be a bit difficult but if you try to understand it is not that difficult.

00:14:39.284 --> 00:14:44.378
Ida and Pingala are the two nadis(channels) within us. Of these one is Mahakali and the other is Maha Saraswati. These are the two nadis.

00:14:44.378 --> 00:14:47.638
The Maha Saraswati has emanated from Maha Kali. Means she is the power of pure action.

00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:50.339
The first one is the power of pure desire and other one is the   power of pure action.

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:57.978
Of these two powers, whatever deeds we have done in this birth as well as past births, whatever are our good deeds ,

00:14:57.978 --> 00:15:04.684
whatever are our bad deeds, this all is evaluated by Shri Ganesha who is within us.

00:15:04.684 --> 00:15:09.315
He is observing how much virtue this person has accumulated.

00:15:09.315 --> 00:15:13.321
Today’s modern people do not have any inkling about virtues and they do not even think about it.

00:15:13.321 --> 00:15:17.118
People think what sense does it make that how much virtue  one has and for what.

00:15:17.118 --> 00:15:22.257
When they don’t have any concept about virtue then sin and its atonement etc.- then knowing these things has no meaning.

00:15:22.257 --> 00:15:26.923
But the human has a feel for sin and virtue.

00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:30.221
Animals do not have this. Animals do not have feel for many things.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:34.889
If you walk  an animal thru dung or filth, it does not sense the smell.

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:37.281
It does not have any appreciation for beauty.

00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:40.554
The moment you become human, you get a thought  about virtue and sin.

00:15:40.554 --> 00:15:44.199
You understand that this is wrong. This is sin, should not do this.

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:46.017
This is a good deed, should do it.

00:15:46.017 --> 00:15:53.496
Instead of we making a judgment about sin and virtue, Shri Ganesh keeps an accurate account sitting within us.

00:15:53.496 --> 00:16:01.208
Every human has a place for Shri Ganesha and it is near the prostate gland, we call it MOOLADHAR chakra.

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:08.840
establishment of Shri Ganesha . The triangular bone is called Mooladhar where mother Kundalini is sitting.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:20.175
Just under that triangular bone, Shri Ganesha is protecting her rather protecting her chastity.

00:16:20.175 --> 00:16:26.063
Now we know how Shri Gauri established Shri Ganesha.

00:16:26.063 --> 00:16:29.883
She was married but had not yet met with her husband.

00:16:29.883 --> 00:16:33.964
That time she had gone for her bath and after removing the dirt from her body……

00:16:33.964 --> 00:16:37.661
Now if you have vibrations in your entire – if your entire body has the divine vibrations

00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:43.365
and if this divine vibration is flowing and if that is taken in the dirt of one’s  body then that too has divine vibrations.

00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:51.994
She created Ganapati out of this dirt and kept it outside her bathing place.

00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:58.260
Now see, she kept him outside the bathing place  and not in the front from where the all the filth is flowing.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:06.981
Many of you must be knowing, when the water from the bathroom flows then many a times the leaves from patra(alu) or some people plant  lotus flowers also and they grow there quite well.

00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:12.471
It is quite surprising , the lotus flowers grow only where there is a puddle.

00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:15.648
Same is the example of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:20.210
Means where  the dirtiest region  of the house is, on that dirty region of the house

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:31.803
this lotus  has bloomed and with its perfume it imparts its fragrance to this dirt.

00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:38.638
This power of his also greatly helps us in our lives.

00:17:38.638 --> 00:17:44.970
The dirt that we see in us is   secured due to the Ganesh element.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:52.498
Now this Ganesh element has to first perform pujan(worship) of Kundalini means of Shri Gauri first.

00:17:52.498 --> 00:17:59.493
Means your Ganesh element first has to perform your Kundalini’s pujan.

00:17:59.493 --> 00:18:02.167
In short ,  to bring abodhita (innocence) in us .

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:15.572
You will be surprised when Kundalini gets awakened that time the fragrance of the Ganesh element spreads in the entire body. (Mataji speaking – These are realized should, please sit here..It does not matter)

00:18:15.572 --> 00:18:35.554
Many people especially Sahaja Yogis sense the fragrance when Kundalini gets awakened.

00:18:35.554 --> 00:18:43.895
Because Ganesh element is made out of earth element or the earth itself is made out of Ganesh element.

00:18:43.895 --> 00:18:48.164
This earth is made out of Shri Maha     Ganesh(Ganesh Almighty).

00:18:48.164 --> 00:18:51.400
So the presence  of Shri  Ganesh in us, that too is comprised of the earth element.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.746
Now we know that all fragrances emanate out of   earth.

00:18:54.746 --> 00:18:56.770
The fragrances of all flowers emanate out of earth.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.693
That is why when Kundalini gets awakened many people sense different types of aromas.

00:19:00.693 --> 00:19:07.065
Not only this, many Sahaja Yogis tell me that Shri Mataji when we remember you we sense very intense fragrance and such fragrances emanate from your body also.

00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:14.445
Many people misunderstand that Shri Mataji wears some perfume but it is not so.

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:18.398
If the Ganesh element is awakened in you then the fragrance emanates from within.

00:19:18.398 --> 00:19:20.322
Different types of fragrances emanate out of a person.

00:19:20.322 --> 00:19:27.158
But you must be knowing that there are such people in world  who call themselves as Sadhus or saints and they cannot  live with fragrance.

00:19:27.158 --> 00:19:30.024
They call themselves God and they cannot tolerate fragrance.

00:19:30.024 --> 00:19:33.397
We have explicit writings on this.

00:19:33.397 --> 00:19:40.101
You read any deity’s description. Especially that of Shri Ganesha. That He loves fragrance.

00:19:40.101 --> 00:19:43.590
Not only that, He loves flowers.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.297
And He loves lotus.

00:19:45.297 --> 00:19:50.010
Similarly it is written in the description of  Shri Vishnu, written in the description of the Goddesses.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:58.582
This means that those people who do not like fragrance ,  who cannot tolerate fragrance they have some serious flaw and they are against the God Almighty.

00:19:58.582 --> 00:20:01.742
They do not have the power of the Almighty for sure.

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:06.122
The person who cannot tolerate fragrance at all, he certainly has some anti-God  elements in him.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:11.863
Because fragrance is a great principle of the Earth element.

00:20:11.863 --> 00:20:17.626
There are many names for it in the language of Yoga.

00:20:17.626 --> 00:20:21.621
Its no use telling about it that as you would keep thinking about it.

00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:32.447
But the important point to note is, whatever five significant elements are and before that whatever life elements they have , the first  amongst  these is the element of fragrance.

00:20:32.447 --> 00:20:39.303
This element constitutes the earth.  Shri Ganesh is made up of this life element.

00:20:39.303 --> 00:20:49.859
Therefore before worshipping Lord Ganesha , one must exude  perfume  ourselves that means our lives should have a subtle fragrance.

00:20:49.859 --> 00:21:00.267
Not at an overt level. A person who  is very wicked, is very vile at an overt level, has an equally fowl smell.

00:21:00.267 --> 00:21:03.318
Such a person from Sahaja Yoga’s perspective is fowl smelling…

00:21:03.318 --> 00:21:06.706
On the outside  even if the person smells good, still that person is not considered fragrant.

00:21:06.706 --> 00:21:09.289
Fragrance should be such that it should attract the person.

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:18.051
If we stand near a person and if we feel pleasant about him and experience purity then that person is a real fragrant person.

00:21:18.051 --> 00:21:26.299
But if the person has lust and libertine instincts oozing out of him,

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:33.985
if you stand near him  some people may feel good and this depends on their vile instincts

00:21:33.985 --> 00:21:37.330
But these people don’t belong to the Ganesh element.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:45.695
A person of the Ganesha principle is very righteous, but still this person has a special charm,

00:21:45.695 --> 00:21:51.240
and this charm has so much holiness that this holiness itself keeps him happy.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.563
Now the concepts of attraction also have become very weird.

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:55.764
They are against the Ganesh element.

00:21:55.764 --> 00:21:58.548
The reason for this is that people do not have Ganesh element in them.

00:21:58.548 --> 00:22:02.363
If a person has the Ganesh element, then the attraction also depends on our Ganesh element.

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:09.574
It is quite natural. If the element is present in us, how can we get attracted unless the other person also has that element as well.

00:22:09.574 --> 00:22:12.231
There is a famous painting of Monalisa.

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:15.843
You would have heard – It is a beautiful portrait  by Leonard-Da-Vinci

00:22:15.843 --> 00:22:21.730
and it is kept in the Louvre museum in Paris.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.691
If we see that painting, see that lady ,you feel she is very listless.

00:22:26.691 --> 00:22:36.300
She has nothing special from the perspective of modern ladies and  according to the modern ideas of beauty, nobody would ever call her a beauty queen.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.974
She has a typical smile over her face  which is called the mobile smile of Mona Lisa.

00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:47.656
And even after working hard on that smile for thousands of years, people have not been able to draw such a portrait.

00:22:47.656 --> 00:22:54.444
What is the main thing about the famous portrait, means what is the main element here and – that  is  Chastity.

00:22:54.444 --> 00:22:57.866
This portrait has so much of chastity that it makes it attractive.

00:22:57.866 --> 00:23:08.067
Even in today’s modern age , behind the weird and perverted thoughts,

00:23:08.067 --> 00:23:12.996
I am surprised that thousands of people come to Louvre to see only that portrait.

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:16.695
If the portrait is not available to view on some day, then nobody goes inside that day.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:22.311
It is a very large museum but nobody is prepared to go in if they are unable to see that portrait.

00:23:22.311 --> 00:23:26.471
That way there is nothing special about that portrait. That lady is in a very simple attire, She has very plain hair.

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:31.029
And in spite of having a very simple face, what is the captivating feature of the portrait?

00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:33.964
Chastity!!  Chastitity is the main feature.

00:23:33.964 --> 00:23:37.466
But in today’s modern world if we talk about purity,

00:23:37.466 --> 00:23:41.074
then the great  intellectuals do not agree with it.

00:23:41.074 --> 00:23:44.142
They feel that these are old ideas

00:23:44.142 --> 00:23:47.658
and these ideas mean don’t do this, don’t do that,

00:23:47.658 --> 00:23:55.290
by saying this we are conditioning people and by thinking  thus a person goes on the wrong path.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:24:02.965
Now to tell you, a person imbibes chastity due to company of his virtuous parents. First of all the mother.

00:24:02.965 --> 00:24:06.245
Firstly, if a mother is not virtuous  it’s very difficult for a son to be virtuous

00:24:06.245 --> 00:24:18.750
but sometimes a child takes birth out of the womb of an adulterous woman just for her salvation because he is a great soul,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:25.210
and a holy soul takes birth in his form.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.896
I have seen that just like a lotus blooms in filth he takes birth there.

00:24:28.896 --> 00:24:37.897
Especially in London I am very surprised to note that there are some small children whose mothers we will not entertain at all at our door steps.

00:24:37.897 --> 00:24:44.376
Even if it is like that it is an exception.

00:24:44.376 --> 00:24:57.173
If by nature the mother is a pious woman then, boy or a girl they become pious quite easily. Or they acquire virtuosity quite easily.

00:24:57.173 --> 00:24:59.721
Here we do not tolerate any utterances against our mother.

00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:02.304
People come charging even if one word is uttered against mother.

00:25:02.304 --> 00:25:06.190
But how many mothers are there today who have this chastity in them.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:15.220
In chastity the main thing the mother has is that she should have loyalty towards her husband, first and foremost.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.654
If Parvati would not have the loyalty for Lord Shiva then is there any meaning to her ?

00:25:19.654 --> 00:25:21.435
There is no importance for Parvati then.

00:25:21.435 --> 00:25:26.742
Even if she is perceived as more powerful than Lord Shiva, that power belongs to Lord Shiva.

00:25:26.742 --> 00:25:33.692
Even if it is the power  of Lord Sadashiva, still first of all she chose Lord Shiva as her superior, she bowed in front of Him.

00:25:33.692 --> 00:25:37.430
And only then she was considered as a powerful deity. But She is His Power.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:40.798
It is different for God Almighty and deities and absolutely different for human beings.

00:25:40.798 --> 00:25:51.298
The humans will not understand that when the husband and wife live in unison they are not separate just like a moon and moon light Or the Sun and its rays.

00:25:51.298 --> 00:25:53.841
The humans don’t appreciate this unison.

00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:57.430
They think that there has to be quarrels between husband and wife.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.661
If there is no quarrel then it is an abnormal thing.

00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:09.518
This way a very pure bond between   a husband and a wife or we can say between Shri Sadashiv and Shri Parvati existed.

00:26:09.518 --> 00:26:13.188
And their son is Shri Ganesh.

00:26:13.188 --> 00:26:18.091
Parvati gave birth to Him only on the basis of her chastity, means she did not include even the father’s component.

00:26:18.091 --> 00:26:24.623
Means only on the basis of her chastity and her resolution  she gave  birth to Ganesha.

00:26:24.623 --> 00:26:27.101
This is such a significant event.

00:26:27.101 --> 00:26:30.383
With her chastity, with her resolution she did this.

00:26:30.383 --> 00:26:34.713
In Sahaja Yoga too, whatever virtuosity I have, I have put it to stake.

00:26:34.713 --> 00:26:43.369
With this resolution – to  give birth to as many people as possible – is the mission that I have set for my life.

00:26:43.369 --> 00:26:50.559
Now before me so many speakers have spoken about me.You don’t think about it.

00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:55.931
Till the time you get something from me, get any experience of me till then you do not get entangled in these things.

00:26:55.931 --> 00:26:59.834
People frown upon such things.

00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:02.434
Not only that, people get furious about it. Now this boy also got angry

00:27:02.434 --> 00:27:04.423
because the speaker said,’ Shri Mataji is a goddess’.

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:06.032
People do not like saying such things at all.

00:27:06.032 --> 00:27:13.895
( these are self realized people).

00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:19.061
They get upset about such things. And to be angry is congruent with human nature.

00:27:19.061 --> 00:27:25.309
If someone refers to you as Devi (Goddess) then people are bound to be upset.

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:30.664
But if idiots refer themselves as God even then people bow to them.

00:27:30.664 --> 00:27:32.085
People consider them as God  Almighty.

00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:40.763
Then if someone makes them dance naked or fleece them of their money, still it is OK. But will still call them Bhagwan

00:27:40.763 --> 00:27:42.765
But one should understand the reality.

00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:51.374
And if we get it , understand it as to what it  means and why we have to say this. And why we have to admit it. Today I am going to tell you that.

00:27:51.374 --> 00:28:00.999
If you do not consider Ganesh as God then nothing will work as per your wish.

00:28:00.999 --> 00:28:02.882
But people don’t understand because you cannot see him in person.

00:28:02.882 --> 00:28:06.285
Suppose a doctor keeps a photo of Shri Ganesha at his residence.

00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:19.906
He will apply kumkum on it and if I tell him that the Ganesh element is physically present in your body, you get physical advantage from it, he will never accept this.

00:28:19.906 --> 00:28:24.180
But if I tell him to remove the photo  of Lord Ganesha from his house, he will not agree to that.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.466
But if I tell him that you cannot make any move without the Ganesh element, then he will not agree to that too.

00:28:29.466 --> 00:28:31.690
They feel that only a doctor can help in body matters.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:36.789
They do not believe in the divinity of Shri Ganesh but in Sahaj Yoga one has to believe.

00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:47.105
The reason behind this is, whatever trouble you face due to the Ganesh element then you have to pray to Lord Ganesha only.

00:28:47.105 --> 00:28:53.514
Means it is like this. Say you have some issue with your prostate gland……Now I want to narrate my experience.

00:28:53.514 --> 00:29:06.573
I have a disciple named Agnihotri. His name is Rajwade but as he has performed many important yagnyas(fire rituals) he is referred to as Agnihotri Rajwade.

00:29:06.573 --> 00:29:10.548
He is a very committed Sahaj Yogi.

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:17.742
Two three years ago he came to me and said that ‘I don’t have any issue except that of prostate gland.

00:29:17.742 --> 00:29:23.629
‘ I was very surprised.This, very accomplished devotee and Sahaja Yogi and why should he have an issue with his prostate?

00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:29.253
Because the prostate ailment arises due to the issue with the Ganesh element or if Ganesh gets upset with him.

00:29:29.253 --> 00:29:31.482
There was no reason for Ganesh to be upset with him.

00:29:31.482 --> 00:29:38.767
As he was a committed devotee   and had total faith in Me and was a very simple person.

00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:43.434
Then why is the Ganesh element working in the opposite direction for him, could not understand.

00:29:43.434 --> 00:29:50.378
I told him,’ take some prasad’. The Prasad is in the form of Chana(peas).

00:29:50.378 --> 00:29:53.306
When I gave this to him, his fellow person said,’ Today dada will not eat anything.’

00:29:53.306 --> 00:30:00.155
I asked ‘Why?Why are you not eating today?’
He said”today is Sankashti.Everyone says you should not eat Chanas on Sankashti.’

00:30:00.155 --> 00:30:03.327
I said,’This is the mistake.Sankashti is Lord Ganesha’s birthday’.

00:30:03.327 --> 00:30:06.540
Now all of you are educated people.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.532
Even if some one tells you anything, you should use your intelligence. Should be alert always.

00:30:11.532 --> 00:30:18.146
We keep fast on Sankashti.Sankashti or Ganesh Chaturthi are the birthdays of Shri Ganesha.

00:30:18.146 --> 00:30:21.753
If you keep fast on his birthday are you in mourning or what.

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:29.288
It’s a simple thing,the expressions of a human being or whatever he shows as being sad or happy.

00:30:29.288 --> 00:30:31.843
Like when someone dies at our place,we do not eat food.

00:30:31.843 --> 00:30:38.876
If your grandchild is born, you will distribute sweets, have a party, have a celebration.

00:30:38.876 --> 00:30:43.175
Then will you keep a fast when Shri Ganesh is born? Then you surely will suffer from prostate problem.

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:48.000
Then cancer of the uterus.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.918
That too happens due to this.

00:30:50.918 --> 00:30:57.843
If you do not treat the Ganesh element with respect means if you do not treat your son well, if you do not have the feeling of motherhood in you –all this ends in Uterus trouble.

00:30:57.843 --> 00:31:00.780
There are very holy rules of the Ganesh element.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.140
If you do not follow them then you suffer from a uterus problem.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.008
But a doctor cannot relate this problem with Shri Ganesha.

00:31:07.008 --> 00:31:11.966
This is related only to Shri Ganesha which he cannot connect.

00:31:11.966 --> 00:31:17.666
He only infers that the prostate gland has deteriorated or that the pelvic plexus has gone bad at the most.

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:24.283
But the undercurrents beneath this or what is understood due to intuition or what is subtly understood –

00:31:24.283 --> 00:31:28.865
– that which you cannot see,for which you still do not have vision,

00:31:28.865 --> 00:31:35.280
for which you do not have sensation or have not reached a state of complete fulfillment – to experience this.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.946
Then how will you understand that this problem is due to the Ganesh element having gone bad and that Shri Ganesh is upset with us.

00:31:40.946 --> 00:31:44.265
That is why we cannot achieve Sahaja Yoga without pleasing that  deity.

00:31:44.265 --> 00:31:47.648
Upon hearing this, this doctor got annoyed.

00:31:47.648 --> 00:31:52.840
The moment we mention Ganesha, all doctors assert that they are not ready to believe in Shri Ganesha.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.085
We only believe in scientists.Then forget about it.

00:31:56.085 --> 00:31:59.032
Your cancer will not cured until you   put faith in the Ganesh element.

00:31:59.032 --> 00:32:01.959
Cancer arises when the Ganesh element is deteriorated.

00:32:01.959 --> 00:32:12.657
If the Ganesh element is deteriorated, as it is maintaining balance in the tiniest atom and molecule, if it is damaged it gives rise to cancer.

00:32:12.657 --> 00:32:15.086
Now I can cure cancer, have cured and will cure.

00:32:15.086 --> 00:32:16.646
But this not my business.

00:32:16.646 --> 00:32:19.692
Now I have informed everyone,  please do not search for Cancer patients.

00:32:19.692 --> 00:32:23.832
Because I have cured many of them and they have proved useless.

00:32:23.832 --> 00:32:28.731
There may be a few of them sitting here.But most of them then don’t follow Sahaja Yoga,don’t make progress further.

00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:31.402
Again when they suffer from cancer then,‘ Mataji,you have cured us once.

00:32:31.402 --> 00:32:33.363
Then how did it recur?’’

00:32:33.363 --> 00:32:34.977
Did you follow Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:34.977 --> 00:32:36.680
Did you pursue it diligently?

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.994
Did you think about it?Did you worship Shri Ganesha? Did you understand Ganesha?Nothing like that.

00:32:40.994 --> 00:32:47.601
I cured you of cancer without charging you a single paisa(farthing). Again you want me to cure you and you took no effort to….

00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:55.443
So Ganesh element is very important, whatever importance one gives it is not enough.

00:32:55.443 --> 00:32:59.594
This,very beautiful Ganesh element made of four petals, is within us.

00:32:59.594 --> 00:33:02.961
And Shri Ganesha is sitting right in the centre of the Ganesh element which is made of four petals .

00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:09.559
This Ganesh is present in us in the pelvic plexus –which is the physical manifestation –and is taking care of  physical aspect of our body.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:22.815
It has many aspects.The first aspect is the physical one and mental.The seed of the Mental aspect  is the Ganesh element.

00:33:22.815 --> 00:33:30.784
As you have seen,as I have demonstrated just now,that the – power of pure desire – which is the power of leftside – it gives all emotions.

00:33:30.784 --> 00:33:36.362
As Ganesh is sitting at the root of that emotion,if an individual has lost his mental balance – his Ganesh element has been spoilt.

00:33:36.362 --> 00:33:40.020
This does not mean that he is impure.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:45.551
But if his chastity is damaged, if his chastity is persecuted by others,still he can be affected.

00:33:45.551 --> 00:33:50.497
If a person is persecuted by others this may also damage his Ganesha principle

00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:55.135
because he feels that if God or Shri Ganesha exists why doesn’t He punish the persecutor?

00:33:55.135 --> 00:33:57.218
Why does this person persecute me so much?

00:33:57.218 --> 00:34:00.871
If there is God,if there is Ganesha then why does he not kill the perpetrator?

00:34:00.871 --> 00:34:03.085
He has a battle axe in His hand.Why does He not massacre him.

00:34:03.085 --> 00:34:08.403
When such questions arise in the person’s mind his left side slowly starts deteriorating.

00:34:08.403 --> 00:34:11.825
And then he is on the verge of becoming mad.

00:34:11.825 --> 00:34:14.331
Just see,how balancing the Ganesh element is.

00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:28.243
However hard you work and whatever trouble you take, or if apply your intellect and think of future, plan ahead.

00:34:28.243 --> 00:34:31.454
Todays people are afflicted by the disease of logical thinking.

00:34:31.454 --> 00:34:39.918
Means if you start thinking too much and if there is no balance in it,then your left side gets severely affected. Means it gets frozen.

00:34:39.918 --> 00:34:42.750
And the right side starts expanding.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.922
Hence left side diseases occurs  due to the damage to Ganesh principle. Like diabetes..

00:34:47.922 --> 00:34:55.717
This disease happens when our Ganesh element is spoilt.To set right the balancing of Ganesha,He attracts our attention to the diabetes.

00:34:55.717 --> 00:34:57.796
Diabetic person starts working less.

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:04.868
Similarly for heart disease.If you perform intense intellectual work then you suffer from heart disease.

00:35:04.868 --> 00:35:06.425
Do you see the balancing here?

00:35:06.425 --> 00:35:09.538
If you do intellectual work then you suffer from heart attack. This is the work of Ganesha.

00:35:09.538 --> 00:35:13.064
Now we have seen that the swastik of Ganesha is placed in our body in such a way-

00:35:13.064 --> 00:35:22.664
means these powers which intermingle with each other, of these  the power that comes from the left is the power of Mahakali.

00:35:22.664 --> 00:35:36.326
The one coming from the right is of Maha Saraswati. – their meeting point however is in the line of Maha Lakshmi.

00:35:36.326 --> 00:35:43.804
The sympathetic system on the left operates due  the power of Mahakali means due to  power of pure desire.

00:35:43.804 --> 00:35:53.632
If lot of things happen against the wishes of an individual and if he suffers a lot due to this and none of his desires get fulfilled then he will go mad, he will not get a  heart attack.

00:35:53.632 --> 00:35:56.808
Heart attack will occur to a  person , who desires a lot of things,

00:35:56.808 --> 00:36:00.523
he wants this also  and that also , and does a lot of planning.

00:36:00.523 --> 00:36:07.812
He wants to do that- wants to serve the country – wants to do nation building – Some or the other thing. These are mental balloons only.

00:36:07.812 --> 00:36:11.388
Nobody has done any work. If they would have done, it would have been visible.

00:36:11.388 --> 00:36:13.764
They have just created quarrels amongst each other.

00:36:13.764 --> 00:36:19.915
Now whatever work this is, we do a lot of such external work.

00:36:19.915 --> 00:36:23.786
We must  do this work and we must do that work – we must ponder over this.

00:36:23.786 --> 00:36:31.653
Because of these things our left side which is called Ida Nadi or which is the Maha Lakshmi element  that gets weakened.

00:36:31.653 --> 00:36:34.850
Due to its being weakened, whatever is supported by it,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.736
or whatever our organs supply to it – that gets endangered.

00:36:38.736 --> 00:36:54.313
I have mentioned it earlier that uterus, kidney, pancreas, heart, thyroid  – all these diseases happen due to over  thinking.

00:36:54.313 --> 00:36:56.811
And it is balanced by Ganesha.

00:36:56.811 --> 00:37:04.526
This is the function of Ganesha. Hence we see that even if people are in a hurry, still if they see Ganesh temple, they would anyway  manage to pay their obeisance.

00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:08.050
There is a long queue at Siddhi Vinayak temple.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:13.268
But does it make any sense? It would benefit only if you have got your self realization.

00:37:13.268 --> 00:37:17.386
If you do not have self realization, if you are not connected to the God almighty,

00:37:17.386 --> 00:37:21.628
then you will not realize how He is divine and how someone else is not.

00:37:21.628 --> 00:37:25.401
You will not realize whether Siddhi Vinayak is the real deity or who else is the real deity,

00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:30.279
Who is a false guru and who is the real guru – you will not be able to fathom this.

00:37:30.279 --> 00:37:36.430
Means this seed of Ganesha that you have in you, after Kundalini arises,

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:42.591
Shri Ganesh explains to Kundalini that this person is suffering from all these issues and the Kundalini guides…

00:37:42.591 --> 00:37:46.077
She should be called as an informer as she provides information.

00:37:46.077 --> 00:37:53.245
Now after the Kundalini rises, you will immediately  understand – if someone has a lever problem, then it would throb at that place.

00:37:53.245 --> 00:37:54.500
You would see this with your own eyes.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.791
If there is a catch on Nabhi Chakra, or if Nabhi Chakra is affected,

00:37:59.791 --> 00:38:06.430
when the Kundalini rises below the Nabhi Chakra, then you can experience the pulsation or the palpitation over there.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:11.211
If a person is affected by a demonic catch (Bhoot Baadha) then it will throb over your back.

00:38:11.211 --> 00:38:16.694
You will be surprised to know that we have created a film on this.

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:20.295
Even if the Kundalini rises due to me – no doubt about it- Kundalini rises,

00:38:20.295 --> 00:38:24.101
but if the Ganesh element is affected then He will pull her down again.

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:27.102
If she reaches the top, she will suddenly drop below again.

00:38:27.102 --> 00:38:31.310
There are many such Gurus, there was one at Pune about whom there are many stories floating around.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:32.771
One does not know what they exactly do.

00:38:32.771 --> 00:38:38.294
But their specialty is that even if I bring up the Kundalini and secure her, still they would pull her down.

00:38:38.294 --> 00:38:44.467
What damage they inflicted on the Ganesh element I don’t know,what they did I am unaware.

00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:49.253
But what I have observed is that the Kundalini definitely falls down.

00:38:49.253 --> 00:38:52.622
Even if I bring up the Kundalini 5 times still it fell down.

00:38:52.622 --> 00:38:59.663
Quite a few times I visited these fake gurus, to see and observe what they were doing,

00:38:59.663 --> 00:39:04.934
I observed then that they indulge in very dirty and improper deeds.

00:39:04.934 --> 00:39:10.277
First they damage the Ganesh element by some or the other means.

00:39:10.277 --> 00:39:13.539
They say that to raise Kundalini they need to put their hand below.

00:39:13.539 --> 00:39:21.300
Now see.The Ganesh element is sitting there like a small child, to protect the chastity of his mother.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:25.654
And the sex drive gets a boost from the Ganesh element.

00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:38.062
So the people who say that they will awaken Kundalini by doing sex, they started saying Ganesh had an illicit relation with his mother means with Kundalini.

00:39:38.062 --> 00:39:41.317
He is sitting there. Anyone who pursues that path, he immediately hits back.

00:39:41.317 --> 00:39:45.341
Many people came to me who said,’ Mataji, Our Kundalini is awakened’.

00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.420
I Said,’ Is that so? What is happening?

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.647
Now when I am sitting in front of you, such and such thing happened.’

00:39:49.647 --> 00:39:55.752
Said,’why did this happen to you. Cool breeze must flow through the hands if Kundalini is awakened.’

00:39:55.752 --> 00:40:02.203
But the person had big boils on his neck and water was oozing through it.

00:40:02.203 --> 00:40:04.153
Some people have a lot of heat in their bodies.

00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:09.665
A person at Delhi sent me telegrams three times,’ Mataji, my Kundalini has awakened, what should I do?’

00:40:09.665 --> 00:40:15.690
That time I was at Mumbai. I said, send him a telegram and call him.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.444
But I started from Delhi and he reached there.

00:40:18.444 --> 00:40:27.340
My sister in law said that he was running here and there as if he is bitten by thousands of ants or scorpions.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.015
Just kept on running from here to there.

00:40:29.015 --> 00:40:33.481
At Delhi,there is one gentleman called Dr Batra.

00:40:33.481 --> 00:40:37.791
He happened to come for a program just like you people.

00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:40.059
Those days I used to cure people, now I don’t do that.

00:40:40.059 --> 00:40:45.332
He said,’Shri Mataji,see me. For one month I have been suffering.

00:40:45.332 --> 00:40:49.499
I am being bitten by scorpions. My Kundalini has been awakened. People say this and that.‘

00:40:49.499 --> 00:40:50.643
So I said,’ Sit down for 2 minutes’

00:40:50.643 --> 00:40:55.342
Still he was impatient, so I went to him and calmed him down in 5 minutes.

00:40:55.342 --> 00:40:58.848
The reason was mother earth. He was standing on the ground.

00:40:58.848 --> 00:41:02.528
‘You sat down on the ground, I am very happy. Today is an absolutely proper coincidence.’

00:41:02.528 --> 00:41:04.643
The mother earth sucked out all his heat.

00:41:04.643 --> 00:41:09.407
Now how will you tell mother earth, ‘O mother earth, you suck all my heat’.

00:41:09.407 --> 00:41:13.347
She will not suck it out,but she sucks it for a Sahaja Yogi.

00:41:13.347 --> 00:41:16.599
The reason is that once the Ganesh element is awakened in you,

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:19.079
and as the same element is present in the earth,

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:22.447
the earth is operational on the same element, she sucks it.

00:41:22.447 --> 00:41:30.309
That is why one should keep this element awakened in us, the human should preserve the chastity.

00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:34.148
Not only this,but in Sahaja Yoga,the Sahaja Yogi,  who is Chastity personified – for him,

00:41:34.148 --> 00:41:36.557
Ganesha is the one who propels him forward.

00:41:36.557 --> 00:41:43.316
In that world, the one who rules, – after paying obeisance three times to that Shri Ganesha –

00:41:43.316 --> 00:41:46.429
one should try to imbibe the purity like HIM in oneself..

00:41:46.429 --> 00:41:55.367
Now the things that should not be told but which the people are talking about,

00:41:55.367 --> 00:41:59.813
about which a lot has been said

00:41:59.813 --> 00:42:04.411
in this way many tantriks (false gurus) have invaded our country.

00:42:04.411 --> 00:42:11.979
While their invasion is not political still it is so immoral and deadly that we are suffering from their deeds.

00:42:11.979 --> 00:42:16.743
These tantriks have created this filth in the 6th century.

00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:23.403
The reasons for that are, the monarchs of those times were vagabonds who lived off on people’s money-

00:42:23.403 --> 00:42:25.393
The abundance of money results into this.First spoil the Ganesh element,

00:42:25.393 --> 00:42:29.098
if money is in abundance then it persecutes the Ganesh element,

00:42:29.098 --> 00:42:34.007
go after young girls, go after small naïve girls – this spreads due to this.

00:42:34.007 --> 00:42:37.329
What do these people do? They do  the same thing

00:42:37.329 --> 00:42:41.982
exploit naivety wherever it is seen, whenever a naïve person is seen, persecute him.

00:42:41.982 --> 00:42:45.266
Destroy ones own naivety.

00:42:45.266 --> 00:42:51.648
For these vagabonds and fun loving people, the monarchs and kings,

00:42:51.648 --> 00:42:56.423
means the kings and monarchs of those days lead a self indulgent life and their ministers who were mostly Jain people.

00:42:56.423 --> 00:43:04.384
Now these Jain people at one point   developed so much orthodox perspective,

00:43:04.384 --> 00:43:08.680
so much religious extremism –I think none of the Indian religions had this.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.684
They became very orthodox people.

00:43:10.684 --> 00:43:14.259
Other religions there is some balancing.

00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:17.224
But Jain people became very orthodox.

00:43:17.224 --> 00:43:20.598
I asked one Jain person.A very renowned Jain saint had been to my place.

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:27.920
I said,‘Mahavira had asked you’ll to contemplate, and you folks built temples and shaved off your heads, roamed around naked – what is this all about.?

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.882
Why do you do these things.What is the need of this?

00:43:30.882 --> 00:43:33.446
First of all, contemplate and be one with God Almighty.‘

00:43:33.446 --> 00:43:37.637
They said that,’we do this as after doing meditation etc. we achieve paranormal  powers.

00:43:37.637 --> 00:43:41.110
When we got these powers, we used to shout like ghosts, used to do this and that.’

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.745
‘Then keep doing it, these things will wear off.’

00:43:43.745 --> 00:43:44.838
That time it may have happened,due to practicing religious extremism.

00:43:44.838 --> 00:43:48.743
But now a stage has come that you should sit for meditation and get your self realization.

00:43:48.743 --> 00:43:51.705
But amongst us, still there are these people. Many Jain people have come in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:51.705 --> 00:43:53.443
At Nagar many people have got their self realization due to this.

00:43:53.443 --> 00:43:58.026
Because they realized that by doing these frivolous deeds, we have not reached the God Almighty.

00:43:58.026 --> 00:44:06.939
Many such people who have tried very hard but could not be one with God Almighty, so to explore something new, they came to Sahaja Yoga and have achieved their self realization.

00:44:06.939 --> 00:44:10.177
What I mean to say is that we too have religious orthodoxy.

00:44:10.177 --> 00:44:13.198
We too have our share of inflexible rules. Maharshtra has lot of this stuff.

00:44:13.198 --> 00:44:16.466
Means one should wash hands 63 times in the morning, don’t know who told this.

00:44:16.466 --> 00:44:22.595
But if the lady washes her hand 62 times and not 63,she will not be able to sleep at night.

00:44:22.595 --> 00:44:26.218
Must prepare so many wicks, do this thing for so many times.

00:44:26.218 --> 00:44:29.829
But they do not do what needs to be done.

00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:33.586
Means while making wicks, bad mouth the daughter in law or daughter.

00:44:33.586 --> 00:44:36.427
We have such things here.

00:44:36.427 --> 00:44:42.558
Hence what I mean is Sahaja Yoga will not be achieved by everyone. It is not for any Tom, Dick and Harry.

00:44:42.558 --> 00:44:48.373
Shri Ramdas has explained the background for our work.

00:44:48.373 --> 00:44:51.839
If you have read “Dasbodh” (religious treatise by Shri Samartha Ramdas, A Marathi Saint) then we do not have to tell you anything.

00:44:51.839 --> 00:44:53.966
He has explained everything and that is the truth.

00:44:53.966 --> 00:45:01.986
A person who has the caliber and who is at that level, only that person can achieve Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:01.986 --> 00:45:08.648
Not everybody.It happens, you will get vibrations, you get realization but again slide back to original state.

00:45:08.648 --> 00:45:10.747
We have given vibrations to thousands of people.

00:45:10.747 --> 00:45:15.111
In this Mumbai city itself at least ten thousand people must have been given vibrations.

00:45:15.111 --> 00:45:17.208
But how many of these really progressed.

00:45:17.208 --> 00:45:21.466
To say, very few. Because they look in the opposite direction.

00:45:21.466 --> 00:45:27.027
There is this guru who respects me also.

00:45:27.027 --> 00:45:31.428
He was telling me that,’ donkeys should be given donkey work.

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:35.718
Why do you keep on giving realization.?What is the need?’

00:45:35.718 --> 00:45:38.394
I said,’there is a dire need,This is the time for that.

00:45:38.394 --> 00:45:41.869
If realization does not happen now, then this is the last judgment.

00:45:41.869 --> 00:45:46.468
It will not work like this.Now write your own judgment.

00:45:46.468 --> 00:45:52.704
Whatever happens after this, whatever loss and profit that will happen, eleven rudras(Ekadash Rudra)will come in this.Eleven Rudras.

00:45:52.704 --> 00:46:00.825
Only one Rudra is sufficient to destroy the whole world.

00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:03.632
But when eleven Rudras come, you cannot imagine.

00:46:03.632 --> 00:46:05.087
They will obliterate everything.

00:46:05.087 --> 00:46:11.536
Before this,for people whose judgment has to be done that judgment should be done now by Sahaj Yoga and people should accept it.

00:46:11.536 --> 00:46:17.326
But for most of the people,they get berserk over small small things and they leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:17.326 --> 00:46:20.633
If I would have charged money and created some commotion and a grand show,

00:46:20.633 --> 00:46:22.287
then people would have liked it more.

00:46:22.287 --> 00:46:25.256
If I ask them tell me first how much money will you give me,

00:46:25.256 --> 00:46:27.222
How much money do you have to give

00:46:27.222 --> 00:46:31.659
means if you cajole the ego of a person,he is ready to come.

00:46:31.659 --> 00:46:37.647
But in Sahaja Yoga it is to be said that all this is done by God Almighty, it happens easily.

00:46:37.647 --> 00:46:42.050
Just like a flower transforms into a fruit,similarly it will happen for you also.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:48.152
And just as you have nose,eyes, mouth and this human form, similarly God Almighty will give you  a super human form.

00:46:48.152 --> 00:46:51.750
It is a gift,it is a boon from the God Almighty.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.148
You cannot do anything about it.

00:46:54.148 --> 00:46:56.131
Human is not ready to accept this stance.

00:46:56.131 --> 00:47:01.877
He has developed so much ego,he thinks that until he stands on his head for 10 days,he will not get anything.

00:47:01.877 --> 00:47:09.584
First you should understand that the God Almighty has done such infinite things which we cannot do,

00:47:09.584 --> 00:47:14.709
we cannot do any living work, then how will we become a super human.He only will do that.

00:47:14.709 --> 00:47:17.195
But only thing is after getting self realization only

00:47:17.195 --> 00:47:20.441
in Human form one understands that he has achieved self realisation.

00:47:20.441 --> 00:47:22.103
This the first thing.

00:47:22.103 --> 00:47:25.499
Second, with the power a person gets,he can make others achieve their self realization.

00:47:25.499 --> 00:47:27.047
This power flows through him.

00:47:27.047 --> 00:47:29.844
This way many people can get their realization.Means he will attain divinity.

00:47:29.844 --> 00:47:32.061
He himself will come into divinity.

00:47:32.061 --> 00:47:34.644
There are many such people,who were followers of great gurus,

00:47:34.644 --> 00:47:38.212
but I have not seen divinity in any of  their disciples.

00:47:38.212 --> 00:47:41.611
There is no transformation that’s taken place in them.They are where they were.

00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:47.269
Even if it happens,due to fear or faithfulness but it has not happened from the inside.

00:47:47.269 --> 00:47:50.289
That event has not taken place.That transformation has not happened within.

00:47:50.289 --> 00:47:54.942
If one wants to convert this equipment into a radio or to make a fruit out of a flower

00:47:54.942 --> 00:47:56.872
means the whole thing changes.

00:47:56.872 --> 00:47:58.454
Nobody has reached this state.

00:47:58.454 --> 00:48:07.598
So in summary, first of all we should protect our Ganesh element.

00:48:07.598 --> 00:48:11.276
Nowdays there are different types of advertisements

00:48:11.276 --> 00:48:19.347
and the advertisements relate to the so called advancement or development in western countries.

00:48:19.347 --> 00:48:22.434
They have gone to the pits,have been completely destroyed.

00:48:22.434 --> 00:48:28.011
That’s why some are in a sad dilemma and are planning day and night as to which method to use to commit suicide.

00:48:28.011 --> 00:48:34.324
This is their state.Hence you should think before you pursue that path

00:48:34.324 --> 00:48:38.391
that why we are doing all this,there has to be a purpose behind it.

00:48:38.391 --> 00:48:39.777
We are in human state.

00:48:39.777 --> 00:48:41.722
That should also have some meaning.

00:48:41.722 --> 00:48:43.627
There is no point in doing the same things again and again.

00:48:43.627 --> 00:48:49.281
Similarly some people have deserted the God Almighty and some are  stuck only to the name of God.

00:48:49.281 --> 00:48:52.384
Right in the morning,light a lamp in front of the deity, ring a bell and that’s it.

00:48:52.384 --> 00:48:56.776
This way or the way I mentioned about some people’s religious extremism of washing hands 63 times,

00:48:56.776 --> 00:48:58.558
people who are such religious extremists should understand

00:48:58.558 --> 00:49:01.442
that they will not connect to the god almighty by doing such futile things.

00:49:01.442 --> 00:49:04.274
God is within us,we should awaken Him.

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:06.908
We should keep him awakened and we should awaken HIM in others.

00:49:06.908 --> 00:49:08.810
This is the message of Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:15.501
So Kundalini is the Mother and Shri Ganesh is her creation, Shri Ganesh is her child.

00:49:15.501 --> 00:49:21.509
Kundalini within us moves on Shri Ganesha’s hand.

00:49:21.509 --> 00:49:23.948
You must have seen what is in Shri Ganesha’s hand.

00:49:23.948 --> 00:49:30.305
Similarly there is a snake tied around his belly or sometimes in his hand

00:49:30.305 --> 00:49:34.674
Means Ganesha has only four hands but actually he has infinite hands.

00:49:34.674 --> 00:49:39.924
Of these they show a snake in one hand.That is the Kundalini.

00:49:39.924 --> 00:49:46.873
Similarly our Sahaja Yogis who get their self realization, it is surprising that Kundalini rises on their hands.

00:49:46.873 --> 00:49:49.546
When they raise their hand,the Kundalini rises up.

00:49:49.546 --> 00:49:52.173
A small Sahaja Yogi child can raise his Kundalini.

00:49:52.173 --> 00:49:56.087
Kids of 2 years, kids of 5-6 months  can also tell the position of your Kundalini.

00:49:56.087 --> 00:50:00.230
My Grand daughter was of 6 months when Modi had come to my place.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.807
And his agnya chakra had a catch.

00:50:01.807 --> 00:50:04.506
While speaking, she did not understand

00:50:04.506 --> 00:50:09.034
when she was crawling she brought the kumkum container and applied kumkum to his fore head

00:50:09.034 --> 00:50:12.260
and released his agnya chakra’s catch.She keeps on doing such thing.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.589
I have seen the same thing in my Sahaja Yogis’ small kids.

00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:18.182
They are born as realized souls. Right from their birth.

00:50:18.182 --> 00:50:20.783
Means what a great thing the God Almighty has started now.

00:50:20.783 --> 00:50:24.248
Souls who are realized from birth itself are coming in this world.

00:50:24.248 --> 00:50:26.187
For that no need to take sannyas ( renounce world).

00:50:26.187 --> 00:50:28.033
People who feel the necessity of taking sannyas,

00:50:28.033 --> 00:50:31.266
they have not been able to get their self realization.

00:50:31.266 --> 00:50:33.495
After being self realized, you get detached from within.

00:50:33.495 --> 00:50:35.839
Once you get detached from within, you need not take the sannyas outwardly.

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:40.311
Means take sannyas, advertise it to the world that one has taken sannyas

00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:43.674
but if nothing has happened from within then what the need to advertise?

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:48.550
If you are a male, then seeing the face itself people can say if he is a male or female.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:53.144
Do you advertise it that you are a male or a female?It is something like that.

00:50:53.144 --> 00:50:55.906
If you become a sannyasi by heart then you are an ascetic from within.

00:50:55.906 --> 00:50:58.390
What ever it may be at the outside but you are a sannyasi on the inside.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:01.109
And you can easily reach this state in Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:03.262
There is no need to take sannyas or anything.

00:51:03.262 --> 00:51:05.836
No need to relinquish the world for that.

00:51:05.836 --> 00:51:11.088
The state of Shri Shankar or the state that Shri Shankar has attained that He too

00:51:11.088 --> 00:51:14.977
needed the creation of Ganesha similarly you too will have to create Shri Ganesh.

00:51:14.977 --> 00:51:17.479
They say that India has a large population,

00:51:17.479 --> 00:51:21.567
it is well accepted that India has a large population,

00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:23.102
where else to increase the population?

00:51:23.102 --> 00:51:26.289
England has a negative growth, Germany too has a minus growth,

00:51:26.289 --> 00:51:29.590
America has a minus growth because any wise person will not take birth there.

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:31.057
All of them will come at our place only.

00:51:31.057 --> 00:51:38.023
There is a statistics indicating that every week in England, parents kill two children.

00:51:38.023 --> 00:51:40.951
If that is the statistics then which wise person will take birth there.

00:51:40.951 --> 00:51:42.750
That is why all of them take birth here.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:46.473
We are tolerating the stupidity of these people and we are being blamed.

00:51:46.473 --> 00:51:48.915
These children will not take birth elsewhere

00:51:48.915 --> 00:51:51.662
as the condition of children is so deplorable at other places.

00:51:51.662 --> 00:51:54.251
Children are appreciated only in our country.

00:51:54.251 --> 00:51:56.343
Today a small child approached me,

00:51:56.343 --> 00:52:01.933
he knows Marathi Language and he asked what do they call a small kid’s playful running(Dududu) around in English?

00:52:01.933 --> 00:52:05.295
How will they have one,I said.Do they even see small kids running around?

00:52:05.295 --> 00:52:08.025
We have some playful terms (Dududu) for a small child’s running around which denotes  affection for kids.

00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:12.190
We should read the description Shri Krishna or read description of Shri Rama from their childhood,

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.463
you would simply appreciate it.

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.659
You will not find the childhood description of Jesus Christ anywhere.

00:52:15.659 --> 00:52:20.652
Only our Rev.Tilak has coined some poems depicting

00:52:20.652 --> 00:52:25.926
how He used‘ to put his small fingers in his mouth and utter some sweet things’ describing Jesus Christ as a small child.

00:52:25.926 --> 00:52:28.323
This is because he has the Indian ethos in his heart and hence he

00:52:28.323 --> 00:52:31.362
described how Christ’s childhood would have been.

00:52:31.362 --> 00:52:36.313
But you will not have an English word describing the playful running of a small child.

00:52:36.313 --> 00:52:39.101
I was also in a dilemma as to how to explain that small kid because

00:52:39.101 --> 00:52:45.717
he body expressions or the body gestures of a small child or the term used to describe the growth in the chubbiness of a child there is no equivalent in English language.

00:52:45.717 --> 00:52:48.934
On the contrary they say that kids should not be chubby,they should be thin.

00:52:48.934 --> 00:52:50.862
because they idolize the actors and actresses.

00:52:50.862 --> 00:52:59.264
This way by creating new concepts they have taken away the innocence and that we should not do.

00:52:59.264 --> 00:53:01.203
There is nothing that we can learn from them.

00:53:01.203 --> 00:53:05.581
You will be surprised to know that soon after the child is born-I also felt the same as what you felt–,

00:53:05.581 --> 00:53:09.547
Whenever a small child is born we take so much care

00:53:09.547 --> 00:53:12.119
but these people put him in a different room after putting on nappies etc.

00:53:12.119 --> 00:53:13.771
And they keep dogs and cats in their bedroom.

00:53:13.771 --> 00:53:16.736
I could not understand why this is so.

00:53:16.736 --> 00:53:19.660
They informed that because it disturbs them at the night.I asked them why have you taken birth in this world?

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:23.820
When my daughters and their children were to visit us,

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:27.082
my husband’s secretary who was a elderly lady who did not have any children

00:53:27.082 --> 00:53:29.631
– she said to me,you must be upset.

00:53:29.631 --> 00:53:32.029
I said why should I be upset.I am very happy that the kids are coming.

00:53:32.029 --> 00:53:34.197
She said that your house would get untidy.

00:53:34.197 --> 00:53:38.002
I said Goodness gracious.We will not even have such thoughts coming to us.

00:53:38.002 --> 00:53:41.714
This is a complete ego orientation.

00:53:41.714 --> 00:53:45.646
Means if you have not paid attention to the Ganesh element then you become ego oriented.

00:53:45.646 --> 00:53:49.307
One develops a terrible ego.An egotist person will always have a conflict with the Ganesh element.

00:53:49.307 --> 00:53:56.928
We have seen that all the great leaders- if you see- their have zero character.

00:53:56.928 --> 00:54:01.039
The reason for it – Once a person develops ego, it grows on the right side,

00:54:01.039 --> 00:54:04.240
and due to growth on the right side the ego keeps on increasing.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.642
And due to this ego whether it is Shri Ganesh or the Ganesh element,or the virtuosity,nothing counts.

00:54:08.642 --> 00:54:12.096
I am the only one that matters is the way he thinks and he loses the Ganesh element in him.

00:54:12.096 --> 00:54:17.086
But another example of this is–the people who take Sannyas,

00:54:17.086 --> 00:54:24.320
who stay unmarried,stay away from  the house and do not stay in touch with others is a similar type of people.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.463
If the Ganesh element is awakened in us,then we can get connected to  God Almighty even by living a family life.

00:54:28.463 --> 00:54:31.715
And even if you want divinity you have to be in this world.

00:54:31.715 --> 00:54:38.440
If you stick to intense and difficult renunciation you may get the title of ‘Brahmarshi’.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.243
But I feel that there are some accomplished Bramharshis –

00:54:41.243 --> 00:54:45.435
I know a lot of them but they are not prepared to do anything now.

00:54:45.435 --> 00:54:50.141
They do not have the earnest desire and they are not ready to take so much effort.

00:54:50.141 --> 00:54:56.416
I sometimes feel sad,their opinion is that whosoever are their devotees – they are not yet ready.

00:54:56.416 --> 00:55:00.325
If we are ready to take effort then we can prepare them and get them ahead.

00:55:00.325 --> 00:55:05.968
Quite a few times I feel that it will be good if all these people come forward and helped me.They revere me a lot.

00:55:05.968 --> 00:55:14.567
There is a gentleman near Calcutta who is an accomplished person

00:55:14.567 --> 00:55:23.081
and he told an American about me,’ Now that Mataji has arrived, we are observing her work.

00:55:23.081 --> 00:55:24.193
We also want to contribute to this work.

00:55:24.193 --> 00:55:29.910
We also want to do this work and destroying the demons etc.- that we are accomplishing by our mental prowess.‘

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.719
But when I asked the American,’why don’t you take him to America?’

00:55:32.719 --> 00:55:35.533
He went to America and came back in 5 days flat

00:55:35.533 --> 00:55:38.781
and said to me,’ I do not wish to meet such people.They are very dirty people.‘

00:55:38.781 --> 00:55:41.649
This is because he is not used to people yet.

00:55:41.649 --> 00:55:45.480
One could say- He cannot tolerate too many people around him as he has been staying away from people.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.658
Now what happened due to this is that if you come across a saint or a hermit,

00:55:49.658 --> 00:55:57.613
you would fall at his feet,you would bestow your faith in him–due to this you will no doubt improve your state but how will you attain self realization?

00:55:57.613 --> 00:55:59.285
Because to achieve that you need to put your hands in the filth.

00:55:59.285 --> 00:56:01.663
If you wish to improve your child, need to bring up your child

00:56:01.663 --> 00:56:03.602
the mother has to deal with filth.

00:56:03.602 --> 00:56:05.936
If she hates the filth then who will clean the child?

00:56:05.936 --> 00:56:08.486
And hence it is the work of a mother only.

00:56:08.486 --> 00:56:10.800
And I am doing the work of a Mother in Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:19.072
You all can bathe in it, take pleasure out of it – this is the desire of a Mother.

00:56:19.072 --> 00:56:23.488
The only wish a mother has is that whatever power she has One may be divine or whatever – you can be so in your own home.

00:56:23.488 --> 00:56:28.358
What is your use to us?You may be  so called Bhagwan etc. what is his use to us ?

00:56:28.358 --> 00:56:33.262
Until the common folks benefit from it,until the common folks can get something

00:56:33.262 --> 00:56:37.545
out of him until their children get their powers–what is the use of such a mother?

00:56:37.545 --> 00:56:40.080
It is better not to be such a mother than to be one.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:51.491
So the person whom you consider to be a guru or your mother, consider elder to yourself, if he has not understood himself then what ideal can you derive from him?

00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:57.965
In Sahaja Yoga you can derive the meaning of ‘Swa”.Meaning of Swa’-  means you can relate to the relevance of your atma.

00:56:57.965 --> 00:56:59.661
This I would explain to you in my next lecture.

00:56:59.661 --> 00:57:01.301
At the moment I have explained about the Ganesh element.

00:57:01.301 --> 00:57:08.550
To tell you, I have written about 50 pages on this.On the Mooladhar Chakra.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:13.806
How the position of Ganesha is on the Mooladhar chakra, how the Kundalini makes sounds in that, and how the Kundalini moves.

00:57:13.806 --> 00:57:23.595
How there are different facets to the petals and how they exist within the petals and how they suck in etc..lot of such things in that.

00:57:23.595 --> 00:57:26.677
And you must get all that knowledge and you WILL get it

00:57:26.677 --> 00:57:28.806
and I will not hide anything about it.

00:57:28.806 --> 00:57:31.310
I am ready to explain everything to you.

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:35.790
but you will have to put all the efforts after realization.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:38.669
If you don’t work hard you won’t get any benefit.

00:57:38.669 --> 00:57:45.708
Now today’s program is about awakening the Kundalini.I think you should work hard for this.

00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:49.123
Now people have a query as to what should be done in the pooja.‘

00:57:49.123 --> 00:57:51.298
‘Shri Mataji, what should be done on the occasion of Shri Ganesha pooja?‘

00:57:51.298 --> 00:58:01.337
I have the knowledge beyond the obvious that you cannot see, what Nanak has called as ‘ALAKH” ( which cannot be seen or perceived).

00:58:01.337 --> 00:58:06.227
I see with those eyes.So first of all I want to tell you to examine if you are chaste enough.

00:58:06.227 --> 00:58:11.033
To take bath etc. is all ok.Even if you don’t do that it is alright.

00:58:11.033 --> 00:58:15.642
One Muslim too performs the Ganesh Pooja quite well, you will be surprised to know.

00:58:15.642 --> 00:58:21.374
In Algeria, approximately 500 Muslim young girls and boys have got their self realization.

00:58:21.374 --> 00:58:23.604
But the main person there is known as Jamel.

00:58:23.604 --> 00:58:26.993
And he performs the Ganesh Pooja so well, that it is worth seeing.

00:58:26.993 --> 00:58:29.196
He establishes the Ganesha and he himself performs the pooja.

00:58:29.196 --> 00:58:33.404
Means in Sahaja Yoga,Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all are included.

00:58:33.404 --> 00:58:36.023
And moreover it has been shown how their deities are included in Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:36.023 --> 00:58:41.323
This Ganesh element, when it comes on the Agnya chakra, it took the form of Christ when it came in this world.

00:58:41.323 --> 00:58:47.417
You would have read in ‘Devi Mahatmya’, the Bhagwat written by Shri Markandeya.

00:58:47.417 --> 00:58:52.052
you could say Markandeya is my most beloved son.

00:58:52.052 --> 00:58:57.242
Nowadays nobody reads Markandeya, but if you can get it, read the description of Shri Maha Vishnu.

00:58:57.242 --> 00:59:00.276
He has mentioned that Radha had created her own son by herself.

00:59:00.276 --> 00:59:03.166
Means just as Parvati created her son, she too had created.

00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:04.474
But Ganesh element is the base for it.

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:11.632
And based on Ganesh Element the son she had created, he came in this world as Christ.

00:59:11.632 --> 00:59:14.948
Now Christ.Since Radha had created him, he is called Christ in the name of Krishna

00:59:14.948 --> 00:59:18.778
and since Yashoda is there, hence Yeshu.

00:59:18.778 --> 00:59:28.599
In this way he has positioned  the Ganesh element in the form of Christ.

00:59:28.599 --> 00:59:34.248
That is why these people who call themselves as Christians they don’t even know that first of all this is the Ganesh element.

00:59:34.248 --> 00:59:40.400
It is the proliferation of the Ganesh element and how he is going to arrive as eleven Rudras I will be explaining you all later.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:50.522
In summary,after reaching the Agnya Chakra, the axe which Shri Ganesha used to hit everyone has turned into a means to forgive.

00:59:50.522 --> 00:59:52.989
Forgiveness is the most powerful means of human beings.

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:58.601
They don’t need a sword, they do not need anything if they forgive others then they will not have to suffer.

00:59:58.601 --> 01:00:04.812
That is why today in Sahaja Yoga, when we get a catch on Agnya Chakra

01:00:04.812 --> 01:00:09.289
we tell people to forgive others and people know how beneficial it is.

01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:14.430
People following Sahaja Yoga have accepted this and they have seen it because in Sahaja Yoga everything is visible.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:18.118
If you do not forgive your catch on agnya chakra will not get released. You headache will not go,

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:21.002
you suffering will not end, your tumor will not decrease.

01:00:21.002 --> 01:00:22.800
Hence to forgive is a must.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.847
Because till the time you compel people, force people they are not prepared to follow.

01:00:27.847 --> 01:00:30.240
I think that is the main reason for all the diseases

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.995
because even if you keep on convincing human beings,they use their own reasoning

01:00:35.995 --> 01:00:38.969
that this may be due to something else, that may have a different cause.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:43.967
This means you have not reached at your inference, your connection has not yet been established, so get it established.

01:00:43.967 --> 01:00:46.271
First of all,get your self realization. That is what I want to tell.

01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:47.955
Do not find a way out of that.

01:00:47.955 --> 01:00:52.197
It cannot happen due to thinking, due to debating or by reading books,

01:00:52.197 --> 01:00:56.703
it should happen from within.It must happen.This event must take place.

01:00:56.703 --> 01:01:00.922
Sometimes there are such super idiots especially in the cities, not in the villages.

01:01:00.922 --> 01:01:05.377
They say,’It did not happen to us.See, we are not affected?’‘Means you are very cool. What else to say?’.

01:01:05.377 --> 01:01:08.524
If you did not get to experience that, it means you are having some problem with you.

01:01:08.524 --> 01:01:12.629
It could be physical, mental or intellectual. Remove it.It is not good.

01:01:12.629 --> 01:01:17.615
It must happen. Only after that you would get happiness. If you think like that , everything will become alright.

01:01:17.615 --> 01:01:22.088
So out of this,the ego portion that you need to offer at the feet of Shri Ganesha.

01:01:22.088 --> 01:01:27.603
If you do all this today then half of my  task will be accomplished.

01:01:27.603 --> 01:01:31.486
Need to request Ganesha about your ego – somehow please take away our ego

01:01:31.486 --> 01:01:35.899
– if you say this and offer your ego to HIM – then it will make me very happy.

01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:39.555
Because I profess that everyone should have a son like Shri Ganesha

01:01:39.555 --> 01:01:44.415
and by merely uttering his name my entire body gets divine vibrations.

01:01:44.415 --> 01:01:49.907
After paying my respects to such beautiful Ganesha, I conclude my speech.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:02:00.514
Do you have any questions? You should have questions.

01:02:00.514 --> 01:02:12.347
I am not a political leader.

01:02:12.347 --> 01:02:17.857
And I have not come to you for an election that please offer me votes etc..

01:02:17.857 --> 01:02:19.949
Need to see if you vote yourself.

01:02:19.949 --> 01:02:28.974
To tell you in English – Nothing is on sale here so don’t come with an attitude of a purchaser, but it is something to be gifted.

01:02:28.974 --> 01:02:36.614
Ok, ask me a question. Ask questions.

01:02:36.614 --> 01:02:59.764
Now we know that our Sahaja Yogis have vibrations flowing through their hands so it will also flow through your hands.

01:02:59.764 --> 01:03:05.329
And I am definitely going to tell about what Shri Shankaracharya has written regarding the divine vibrations etc.

01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:12.385
But when these vibrations flow and then how to harness them…

01:03:12.385 --> 01:03:15.996
(Mataji talking to people – please sit down I will explain a little. Are you in a hurry?

01:03:15.996 --> 01:03:30.859
Yes, yes. I am going to explain tomorrow. But don’t come only to listen. Please come to take away something.

01:03:30.859 --> 01:03:35.493
I am not giving a religious discourse. Come to take something. And bring your home folks also.

01:03:35.493 --> 01:03:40.927
Please don’t just wait.Tomorrow bring all of them and get your self realization.

01:03:40.927 --> 01:03:50.819
Please sit and be patient. It cannot happen in a hurry.)

01:03:50.819 --> 01:03:54.309
A couple of days back one doctor had come He said he came here as it was on the way of his visit.

01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:57.282
I told him it will be good if he proceeds on his visit.

01:03:57.282 --> 01:03:59.222
So you need to be patient.

01:03:59.222 --> 01:04:13.419
We don’t have time for God Almighty. He has given everything to us for that time only.

01:04:13.419 --> 01:04:19.590
He has created the universe and filled it with so much science.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:25.908
Science is given by God Almighty only for contemplation and this is not understood by the humans.
