00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:10.747
So it’s, I mean, in the name of
God ridiculous things were done,

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:13.248
ridiculous things were done!

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:15.520
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.947
The first step is Self-Realization.

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:21.095
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:24.181
Because He said nothing doing,
don't talk about God or anything,

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:26.947
first you get your Realization.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.580
That was the first condition, establish it.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.981
Unless and until you have established your Realization,
- nothing doing.

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:42.680
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.981
Buddha's knowledge or you can
Buddhism you can say as they call it.

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:48.081
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:50.580
So all that He started

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.981
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:59.814
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:03.480
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.881
means the one who is a Realized soul.

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:10.881
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.280
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.660
I surrender to the Buddhas -
means to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:24.747
You are all Buddhas because you know.

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:28.074
When you know, you are the Buddha.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.464
When that purity comes, you see in our temperament,

00:01:31.544 --> 00:01:34.664
that we do everything without any desire,

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:37.996
we have got rid of all the ego.

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:39.764
The Buddha is awakened within us.

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:42.464
And that’s what is the importance of Buddha,

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:44.664
that He settled down Himself

00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:47.731
in a place which is the most difficult place,

00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.863
that is on the left side of your head, you see.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:54.397
Sometimes I've seen it projects
here up to this point, you know,

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:57.564
in some people they get such a terrible pain, you know,

00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:00.564
pulling it out from there, can't imagine.

00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:06.263
So this horrible point which is -

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:10.230
so funny it is, sometimes it
can blow up like that, you see,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.731
sometimes it can pierce through. It’s a horrible one

00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:16.863
which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see,

00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:20.263
and it takes it forms in different ways and methods.

00:02:20.343 --> 00:02:25.896
For that we have to say, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:30.343
means: We surrender ourselves to Buddha.

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:34.130
Then what does He say? The second one is very good:

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.163
‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’:

00:02:37.243 --> 00:02:40.130
I surrender myself to collectivity, ‘sangham’.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.564
‘Sangha’ is the collectivity.

00:02:42.644 --> 00:02:46.497
I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.

00:02:46.577 --> 00:02:49.664
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity,

00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:51.330
which is the enlightenment,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.963
you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha.”

00:02:56.043 --> 00:03:00.963
Secondly you say: “I surrender myself to collectivity.”

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:04.644
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:08.497
So, ‘I surrender myself to collectivity’,

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:16.577
so we say: “Sangham Sharanam Gachhami.”

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:24.130
It is to Virat we are doing.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.130
What is the third one, is? "BuddhamSharanam Gachhami",

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.863
"Sangham Sharanam Gachhami", the third one -

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:32.464
‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:34.996
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami. ‘Dhammam’ means

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:37.397
the religion - the balance.

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:41.564
I surrender myself to religion, which is essence of you,

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:43.831
or you can put it the other way round,

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:48.996
that, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami,
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami,

00:03:49.076 --> 00:03:50.597
Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’.

00:03:50.677 --> 00:03:55.030
That's all. If you have achieved
it then we can talk of God.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.230
Not before that.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.731
So these three things are to be achieved.

00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.263
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this:

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:08.564
First of all: ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:14.564
‘I surrender myself to my virtues’.

00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:17.397
All desires can be surrendered to a virtue.

00:04:17.477 --> 00:04:20.184
Is it virtuous to do like this?

00:04:20.264 --> 00:04:23.330
You can, if you are brought
up that way you’ll just not do it.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.163
You'll have no desires to do something,
that is not virtuous and righteous.

00:04:27.243 --> 00:04:28.996
You will just not do it.

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:32.197
So, ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’.

00:04:32.277 --> 00:04:35.230
Then you should say, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami’, means:

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.764
I surrender myself to my enlightenment.

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:40.963
This is the second state, when you are ascended.

00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:46.030
Surrender myself to enlightenment.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.996
Enlightenment that I've got to my Spirit.

00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:52.263
Is the Spirit who is going to guide you.

00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:57.664
No more my physical, mental,
emotional nonsensical temptations.

00:04:57.744 --> 00:05:00.764
But what? Is the Spirit?

00:05:00.844 --> 00:05:04.963
And thirdly: ‘Sangham Sharanam
Gachhami’, to the collectivity,

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:08.397
to the whole, to the Virat.

00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:11.397
This is the way we have to work it out.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.130
So ultimately he reached the same point,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.863
that let me start it from myself.

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:22.731
It's from myself to others, not from others to myself.

00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:27.697
Is like treating the tree from
outside, not from the roots.

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:30.731
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:33.963
First you get your Realization,all right,

00:05:34.043 --> 00:05:40.996
then you learn how to surrender yourself to your Dharma.

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:45.697
Then you become collectively conscious.

00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:48.996
Collectivity is a temperament,

00:05:49.076 --> 00:05:55.697
is a sense of enjoyment that
you get in the collective living.

00:05:55.777 --> 00:06:03.744
Unless and until you have that
you have not achieved your joy.

00:06:05.644 --> 00:06:11.677
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.996
and He is a very great powerful force within us.

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:23.530
I’m very happy that Buddha
Jayanti has fallen here in England,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.497
because as we say the England
is the Heart of the universe -

00:06:27.577 --> 00:06:31.976
it doesn't matter if I say here, is any Arab here?

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:37.230
I don't want to displease any Arab people sitting here.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.664
All right. And if it is the heart

00:06:42.744 --> 00:06:48.397
whatever you do here will circulate in the whole universe.

00:06:48.477 --> 00:06:51.464
So if you can conquer your ego here,

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:57.263
you can even conquer the ego of
Mister Reagan and these Russians.

00:06:57.343 --> 00:07:00.464
You can manage that. But first start it here.

00:07:00.544 --> 00:07:02.597
It has to reverse back you see, now

00:07:02.677 --> 00:07:08.664
they have to learn from you and you don’t learn from them.

00:07:08.744 --> 00:07:14.764
When it will work out you’ll be amazed.

00:07:14.844 --> 00:07:19.263
Ego is the only problem I
always face reaching their hearts.

00:07:19.343 --> 00:07:23.564
If ego is removed everything will be all right.

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:29.697
So for us the great mantra is "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami".

00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:34.530
These three mantras you must say everyday I think,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.129
to get rid of this horrible ego.
