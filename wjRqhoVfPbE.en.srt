1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:09,550
Now I have been already with your fiancés
and I talked to them.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,740
I have praised you a lot.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:22,640
Now first thing we have to know that this
marriage ceremony that we have organised with

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,680
a purpose.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:31,130
The first purpose is that regard marriage
is very essential for Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,500
If somebody doesn’t want to marry, we say
alright you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,540
It’s alright.

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:47,150
Now why marriage is important, because a marriage
is like a big Yagnya, it’s like a big Tapasya,

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:54,010
you can call it, or it’s a great experience.

10
00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:00,500
How to achieve balance, how to become a witness
and how to become a spirit.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
It’s very important.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:11,750
Now the first and foremost thing we have to
know (is) that he is your husband and nobody

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,380
else is your husband.

14
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,990
Nobody is more important than he is.

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,190
See men are very easy to be controlled.

16
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,860
If you can make them feel they are the most
important people for you, then you can manage

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,160
them very well.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,409
But the first foremost ambition should be
or the idea should be that I will make my

19
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,900
married life extremely happy.

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,200
Because if the married life is happy you will
be happy.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,760
Now men have a habit of sometimes losing temper.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,689
Doesn’t matter that’s their habit.

23
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:51,159
So you shouldn’t immediately become the
same type.

24
00:01:51,159 --> 00:02:05,439
But you can little bit in a womanly way try
to put your sweet device of smiling it or

25
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,849
laughing it out or little bit [showing you
nice?] somehow.

26
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,870
But not to make it serious.

27
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,319
It’s very important.

28
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,700
So how to handle the men.

29
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,530
Especially your husbands is an art and that
art you will achieve gradually when you start

30
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,590
seeing.

31
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,180
But if you start finding faults with the men
and start saying you can’t do this, you

32
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,689
can’t do this, you don’t know how to drive
or how to do this, or this things.

33
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,489
Then you are finished.

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,489
You must say you are the best driver.

35
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,590
You are the best.

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,984
That’s the way you have to deal with him.

37
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:44,984
But not that you are befooling them.

38
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:47,540
Because you say this because you love.

39
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,170
And love is the basis between you and him.

40
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,170
Nothing else.

41
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,170
Not Money.

42
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,139
Not what you have got for him or he has brought
for you.

43
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,349
Nothing of that.

44
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,060
All these things are not materialistic.

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,329
They have nothing to do with matter.

46
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:08,709
Love is something which you can express also
through matter, sometimes by giving some nice

47
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,530
presents or nice food or something.

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,560
But the most important thing is your heart.

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,219
You should not cheat.

50
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:21,559
In anyway you should not be hypocritical,
and you should not try to do something that

51
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,269
is not pure.

52
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:31,209
So in Sahaja Yoga, the purpose of these marriages
is to have you connected internationally.

53
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,859
So you all transcend all the barriers of your
nationality, the barriers of our racialism,

54
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:45,400
barriers of caste, barriers of so much materialism.

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,359
So you should not compare your husband with
anyone.

56
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,450
He is Your husband and you shouldn’t expect
too much from him.

57
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,849
He’s not given me this, he has not done
that for me, he’s like this.

58
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,650
This is not necessary.

59
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,879
You must always think what I have done for
him.

60
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,939
Also what’s wrong with me?

61
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:09,639
Now some people, especially in the west it’s
very common, that after marriage they think

62
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,120
that they have to work out marriages, no working
out.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,600
You see like they think that as you work out
your kitchen or work out your things.

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,730
It’s not like this.

65
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,270
Spontaneously between the two human beings
who are realised souls.

66
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,970
It is not that you are working out anything,
but spontaneously you are going to enjoy,

67
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,970
spontaneously.

68
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:39,100
Now if you become extremely critical and try
to show you are very brilliant and this.

69
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,760
It’s not going to work.

70
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,500
To be humble.

71
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,190
Keep quiet.

72
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,820
Those who are really intelligent always keep
quiet and watch things.

73
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,820
But those who are not, are bumptious.

74
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:59,390
The more you are in Sahaja Yoga, the more
you will be respected by him and by everybody.

75
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,060
Apart from that, there are so many saints
who want to be born.

76
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,660
Once you have very happy married life among
yourselves, those saints will be born to you,

77
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,990
and it will be such a blessing and joy for
you.

78
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:19,250
So try to understand not to boss your husband
or try to put him right or do things and in

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,250
a very.

80
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,560
I have seen some ladies who are extremely
tense, very tense type.

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,810
They can never give joy.

82
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,340
They are themselves not in joy, how can they
give joy, are themselves not in joy.

83
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,940
So the tension should not be there.

84
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,610
At all of any kind.

85
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,690
Be relaxed.

86
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:42,170
You are the other side of SahajaYoga, which
gives peace, joy, nourishment and also complete

87
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,490
tranquillity.

88
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,150
In the family you are responsible for tranquillity.

89
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,970
Even if husband is angry, children are fighting,
if the mother is tranquil you can control

90
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,350
all the situation.

91
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:01,180
So the situation has to be controlled in a
way that you make life happy for everyone.

92
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,370
Sometimes women feel very angry when I tell
them that first feed your children, your husband

93
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,860
and then you eat yourself.

94
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,620
Because that is the job of a woman.

95
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,340
Like a man should go, earn living, do what
he wants to do, job and all that.

96
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,150
But the woman has to really look after the
husband, look after the family, look after

97
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,150
everything.

98
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,750
Also you will find our Indian husbands not
so good, as far as gardening is concerned,

99
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:39,800
or you can say, they don’t know how to mend
anything like cars or your plumbing, they

100
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
don’t know.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,270
So doesn’t matter, take it easy.

102
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,430
Gradually they will pick up and they’ll
learn and they’ll do it.

103
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,270
But don’t become impatient with them.

104
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,630
Just make fun of it, you see, just make fun.

105
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:57,530
That the best way to manage it and that don’t
expect too much, that they will do this nicely.

106
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,630
Sometimes they cannot clean the utensils properly,
they don’t know how to do it.

107
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,630
So alright.

108
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,160
Just make fun of it and just enjoy it because
they have [unclear].

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,010
You see in England or America I have seen
anywhere, they have no servants at all.

110
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,430
While we have servants here so all these boys
are spoiled by the servants.

111
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,600
So they are absolutely good for nothing as
far as these things are concerned.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,750
But if you just try to teach them and help
them, they will definitely go all out to do

113
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
it.

114
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,960
So the only thing you have to do is to love
them with a clear heart.

115
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,620
And all the time forgive and let them know
that that she is the only one I have in the

116
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,530
whole world apart from the Holy Mother.

117
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,330
Of course, I’m not against divorce, but
I’m not for it.

118
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,410
In the sense that I don’t like people when
they divorce.

119
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,610
But when things are impossible and difficult
and one has to go in for such a thing, doesn’t

120
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,610
matter.

121
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,610
Sometimes one has to do it.

122
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,280
But it should be very rare.

123
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,710
One should not think of a divorce at all.

124
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,610
People think of divorce in the west mostly
because of the laws, because the wife gets

125
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,480
the money or the husband gets the money.

126
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,230
But in SahajaYoga if you are marrying, all
these things even if you are divorced, I will

127
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,740
not support.

128
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,980
Moreover, another thing is that the wives
should not take money from the husband and

129
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,470
send it to her relations.

130
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,470
Never.

131
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:35,439
It’s a very very wrong thing, is to support
your family through the money of their husband

132
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,439
Absolutely not allowed.

133
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,529
That should not be done.

134
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,779
They.., you should not put the pressure of
your family on your husband.

135
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,750
You see there has to be a clear cut understanding
for all of you.

136
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,550
That you will not take.you must keep your
self respect.

137
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,680
Don’t ask for anything.

138
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,449
If he gives you anything [unclear] well and
good.

139
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:00,060
But don’t ask, don’t demand.

140
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,480
That means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

141
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,149
If you are a satisfied soul why should you
ask for anything?

142
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:09,930
Or somebody gets something, she has got this,
she has …Nothing of that kind.

143
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:18,170
You be satisfied and this is how some girls
nag the husbands very much.

144
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,959
Most important thing is that you should not
talk about your past, at all.

145
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,959
Because past is finished.

146
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:24,959
Now you are Sahaja Yogis.

147
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,069
You are all realised souls.

148
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:30,740
So you don’t have to say a word about your
past.

149
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,870
Even if husband starts talking you just stop,
and tell him we are to live in the present.

150
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,879
Don’t tell us about your past.

151
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,399
I don’t know why people think that they
will look more attractive if they talk about

152
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,559
all the past nonsense they did.

153
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,829
Or say that my mother was so bad.

154
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,300
All psychological nonsense.

155
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,129
Not to put your parents into jeopardy by saying
that they are very bad, they are no good.

156
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,129
This, that..

157
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:07,089
Just forget the past and live in the present
because in the present resides the reality

158
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:12,059
and the reality is the ocean of joy.

159
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,630
You should not nag him for anything.

160
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,439
Supposing he didn’t like something, you
shouldn’t do it.

161
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:22,389
Whatever he doesn’t like, small things,
you know like, I was married in a family which

162
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,749
was culturally very different, very different.

163
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,630
And they don’t wear flowers.

164
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:33,399
You see, and in India all the married ladies,
I mean down south, I’m saying in my community,

165
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,899
all wear garlands around their buns and [unclear].

166
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,649
Always wear.

167
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,230
My husband said no better not do it.

168
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:49,689
Because you know here in our community only
the bad women wear that to attract man.

169
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:53,069
Since that day I have never worn it.

170
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,970
Doesn’t matter, not important.

171
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,930
So, also you must understand now you have
to take to the style of life of your husband.

172
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,760
He is fond of entertaining, look after that.

173
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,160
Women should be entertaining, they should
look after.

174
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,329
They should not mind if somebody comes to
stay with them or lives with them.

175
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:12,750
They should not try to show.

176
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,619
On the contrary they should be happy they
are able to look after someone who is a Sahaja

177
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:18,619
Yogi.

178
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:23,170
So, for the Sahaja Yogis, you must keep always
your heart open, your house open.

179
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,560
There are so many things which I would like
to tell you but in this short time, I have

180
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:37,040
to just say that it is the responsibility
of the women to make their marriages happy.

181
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:45,690
Depends on their intelligence and on their
dedication to Sahaja Yoga.

182
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,560
It’s your responsibility.

183
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:56,550
And if you see in a wider sense the responsibility
of making a good society is that of a woman.

184
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,170
Even if she has to suffer she can.

185
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,420
She is like this mother Earth.

186
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,949
She can suffer anything She never feels she
suffers.

187
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:03,209
She is so great.

188
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,019
You are Shaktis.

189
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,290
So as Shaktis if you have to suffer, you don’t
mind.

190
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:17,439
And what you have to feel is that we are responsible
for making our Sahaja Yoga society a perfect

191
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,439
society.

192
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,160
That’s our responsibility.

193
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:31,519
All your greed, all your ambitions, everything
should be directed towards making a very very

194
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,819
happy married life.

195
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:49,669
I wish, I wish all, all of you, a very happy
and prosperous married life.
