00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:38.948
I am happy that you all have adjusted
yourselves in this small space.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.651
When there is love and understanding,

00:00:42.852 --> 00:00:48.134
little space can occupy many hearts.

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:55.300
But when there is no large heart

00:00:55.508 --> 00:01:02.250
then whatever one may get is just never
sufficient.

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:11.238
Today, we are going to worship Shiva
Tattwa within us, principle of Shiva.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:17.230
For all Sahaja Yogis it’s very important,

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.990
because Shiva is the ultimate we have
to achieve.

00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:26.809
Shiva is represented in our Spirit,

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:36.078
so to become Shiva is the ultimate aim
of everything else.

00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:44.201
The rest of it is all created, like Vishnu
Tattwa

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:52.265
and Brahmadeva, just to create human
beings,

00:01:52.466 --> 00:02:01.731
to evolve them and then ultimately lead
them to Shiva.

00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:05.111
That’s the ultimate.

00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:16.885
But human beings get so involved into
the Brahmadeva’s Tattwas

00:02:17.086 --> 00:02:21.986
that even to get into Vishnu Tattwa is
difficult.

00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:28.564
They get involved into the five elements
which have created us.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:32.329
That is the outermost being within us.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:41.237
All the chakras have the outermost, we
can say the, just the vessel,

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:49.143
but the desire to be the Spirit

00:02:50.883 --> 00:02:56.568
is of primal importance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:04.239
So we have to see inward towards ourselves
as Sahaja Yogis,

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:09.480
“Do we have that desire entirely,

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:15.442
or we have still many desires hanging
around?”

00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:23.241
You see, the greatest problem is
of the Nabhi chakra,

00:03:23.442 --> 00:03:27.397
whether it is in the East or the West.

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:36.454
Some people still have hankering for
the baser search of food,

00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:45.488
which is very surprising, even in Sahaja
Yoga, of Nabhi chakra.

00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:52.764
Then, still some people have sense
of possessions and money quite a lot.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.600
And subtler and subtler they grow,

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:59.956
still the detachment doesn’t develop
within them.

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:07.254
It becomes subtler.

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:14.650
As you grow subtler, the attachment becomes
subtler and difficult to get out.

00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:18.395
Specially people who come up as leaders
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:24.735
or closer to Sahaja Yoga, are always
under attack.

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:32.544
They are attacked maybe by their husbands,
wives, brothers, sisters,

00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:35.969
sons, children, something like that.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.900
And that makes it worse

00:04:44.273 --> 00:04:49.936
because all such leaders who are attacked

00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:57.644
try to displease all the deities by small
things here and there.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.966
The whole behaviour has to be understood

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:10.259
that you have become a subtler person
and you are rising higher,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.462
so naturally the negative forces are going
to attack you.

00:05:15.663 --> 00:05:21.620
Always the front line is under attack, not
the back line.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:27.308
So those who are in the front are always
under attack

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.186
and they have to be very careful as to how
they are behaving.

00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:38.209
For if there is a sly person, he will
become sly, but subtler sly.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.319
He will not just become the other way
round, his slyness will become subtler.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.372
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will
become miserly in a subtler way.

00:05:50.573 --> 00:05:52.757
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.220
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler
way.

00:05:56.421 --> 00:06:05.746
But to get rid of these things within you,
you have to go to the other side of it.

00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:07.788
Say if you are miserly, you become
absolutely generous;

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:11.585
give up everything that you have.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:18.396
Don’t be calculated, don’t talk of money,
don’t worry about money.

00:06:19.142 --> 00:06:25.592
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much,
you should go the other way round.

00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:31.750
Unless and until you become juxtaposition,
you cannot get rid of these things.

00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:35.706
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very
hot-tempered, then become so mild

00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:39.687
that even if somebody beats you,
it’s all right.

00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:41.706
Whatever one says it’s all right.

00:06:41.907 --> 00:06:47.610
That’s how you get rid of your habits which
become subtler and subtler.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:57.130
There’s another way of dealing with it:
being alert.

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:59.884
When you are alert, you start seeing
yourself

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:03.427
as a separate person with the habits that
it has,

00:07:03.628 --> 00:07:05.661
and then you start understanding why you
are behaving,

00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:09.369
“Oh, I understand, I knew you before,
ten years back,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.223
before my realisation. I know Mr.,
you are like this.”

00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:22.208
And then take the juxtaposition against
that personality and just shoot it off.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.982
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided
person,

00:07:26.183 --> 00:07:29.391
whatever you may do for that person,
he will become subtler and subtler.

00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:34.663
Suddenly, if it’s a girl, she will start
just crying for nothing at all

00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:39.047
and feeling miserable. If it’s a boy, if he
thinks about, analyses

00:07:39.248 --> 00:07:46.424
he will become analyser of Sahaja Yoga
also, in a subtler way.

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:49.039
Then what they should do is to stand before
the photograph

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.964
and see the reflection, “That’s the other
one who died.”

00:07:54.165 --> 00:08:02.840
And just try to make fun of that or shout
at it, depends on.

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:08.701
If it is an aggressive stuff, it’s better
to make fun, because it’s stupid.

00:08:08.918 --> 00:08:13.191
And if it is that one that takes
aggression, then shout at it,

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:17.194
“What do you mean, by taking aggression
like this?”

00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:22.827
All these things, you see, are keeping you
away from reality.

00:08:23.028 --> 00:08:28.754
Your being has to be cleansed. With your
help only I can do it.

00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:30.996
Many people say, “Mother, You are
all-powerful.”

00:08:31.197 --> 00:08:34.586
All right, I am and I can do everything.

00:08:34.787 --> 00:08:38.660
But only thing I cannot surpass your
freedom.

00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:45.247
That’s a fact, I cannot cross over your
freedom.

00:08:45.747 --> 00:08:52.270
And when I cannot cross your freedom,
you have to cross that.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.012
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:58.997
then I will bestow upon you all
the blessings.

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:04.967
But if you want to stand outside, I am not
the one to put you in with a pistol.

00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:08.588
No, that’s not the way it will work out.

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:12.196
This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must
know

00:09:12.397 --> 00:09:18.259
that at every moment you are free,
and freer, and freest.

00:09:19.063 --> 00:09:21.991
The more free you become, the worse
is your situation,

00:09:22.192 --> 00:09:25.076
as far as the facing of the negativity is
concerned.

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:29.310
Say if there are four persons are around
you,

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.074
they will be first attacked.

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:38.071
Naturally, you can understand the front
line is always under attack,

00:09:38.272 --> 00:09:40.177
not the back side.

00:09:40.378 --> 00:09:42.966
Though according to the law, it should be
the back side

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:47.240
because all these horrible, negative forces
should come from the back.

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:50.325
But they are very clever, they know
that the back

00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:54.048
sometimes drop out by themselves,
so no need to go that side.

00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:56.989
They try the front line.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.620
And those who think they are in charge
and responsible

00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:05.490
have to be very careful as to how they
behave,

00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:08.993
how they are responsible, how they work
it out,

00:10:09.194 --> 00:10:12.258
if they are keeping their old habits
at a subtler level

00:10:12.459 --> 00:10:16.279
or they are just fighting it out. It’s very
important.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.784
And this is how intelligently you can
manage yourselves, very well.

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:27.348
Then once you become detached,

00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:32.208
you know, from all these things -
only at mental level.

00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:35.180
The spiritual level I’ll look after. But
at mental level,

00:10:35.381 --> 00:10:41.449
you must come to logical conclusion that,
“I have to fight this nonsensical stuff.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.599
I have to be alert about this nonsense that
exists within me.”

00:10:55.643 --> 00:10:59.722
Shiva Tattwa is innocent, absolutely
innocent it is.

00:10:59.923 --> 00:11:04.131
It is very powerful and extremely innocent.

00:11:04.332 --> 00:11:09.072
And the secret to achieve it is only just
to please, just to please Him.

00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:13.538
If you please Shiva, then you may be
a rakshasa or anything,

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:17.304
He grants all kinds of boons.

00:11:17.505 --> 00:11:26.193
But to a rakshasa He can only grant
the boon of longevity, of long life.

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:33.990
But to a saint, He’ll grant the Sat-Chit-
Ananda state.

00:11:35.557 --> 00:11:41.759
So even if He grants anything to
a rakshasa,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.626
one should not ask questions about it.

00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:46.605
He can give him longevity, what does it
matter?

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:52.571
Even if you live for thousands of years
and earn nothing out of it;

00:11:52.772 --> 00:11:54.431
you never get your realisation.

00:11:54.632 --> 00:12:01.827
So to a saint, He gives that eternal
longevity

00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:05.460
which comes through Spirit.

00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:13.782
This is the blessing of Shiva Tattwa.
While Vishnu Tattwa,

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:29.073
He gives ascent to a saint and light
of wisdom

00:12:29.287 --> 00:12:36.545
to see and understand everything
in collective consciousness,

00:12:36.746 --> 00:12:45.285
and to a rakshasa He gives death, He kills.

00:12:45.486 --> 00:12:54.771
So for people who are not so deep,

00:12:54.972 --> 00:13:02.647
it seems that why should Shiva give any
blessings of longevity to a rakshasa.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:11.362
These are the characters of these different
deities.

00:13:11.563 --> 00:13:18.258
Now for example, if a rakshasa wants
to live long,

00:13:20.087 --> 00:13:26.250
he goes to Shiva, pleases Him by praising
Him,

00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:32.549
singing songs to Him, by asking His
blessings, by doing the tapas for Him,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:38.977
talking about Shiva’s innocence, he gets
longevity.

00:13:39.178 --> 00:13:46.112
Sometimes, these rakshasas are better
on the earth than in the subconscious.

00:13:46.313 --> 00:13:48.376
They can be horrid.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:53.469
They can gather some more bhoots to torture
human beings.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.470
So it’s better to keep them in the eyes
of Vishnu.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:07.009
He manages them better here than to send
them into the subconscious.

00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:12.495
But Shiva’s style is very different from
that of Vishnu’s style.

00:14:12.696 --> 00:14:14.891
You have to have all kinds of styles
because you know

00:14:15.092 --> 00:14:19.044
there are so many permutations and
combinations in human beings.

00:14:19.245 --> 00:14:21.490
If you have one style, what will you do
with the other style

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.818
of human beings, you see?

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:31.843
So the style of Vishnu is that if you are
trying to be funny,

00:14:32.044 --> 00:14:38.583
He plays tricks and puts you right.

00:14:39.216 --> 00:14:41.649
Say, a Sahaja Yogi – He (Vishnu) is not
interested if you [see],

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.331
so much in other people, but in Sahaja
Yogis.

00:14:45.532 --> 00:14:51.204
If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny; say he
wants to drink wine,

00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:54.835
“All right”, He says, “Drink wine.”

00:14:55.036 --> 00:14:58.951
He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick
somewhere,

00:14:59.152 --> 00:15:02.710
his car falls off, or he is insulted
somewhere.

00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:04.989
Something happens to him, he is punished
so badly

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:10.782
that he says, “Oh God, what have I done?”
That’s Vishnu tattwa.

00:15:10.983 --> 00:15:13.141
But Shiva is the other way round. If you
see Shiva’s style is this,

00:15:13.342 --> 00:15:18.235
If you see Shiva's style

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:24.517
that if you drink, He just disappears
from your heart;

00:15:24.718 --> 00:15:28.244
you have a heart attack and you die.

00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:35.522
He also kills. One kills directly – in
a positive way, He definitely kills;

00:15:35.723 --> 00:15:39.120
the another one by recession. If Shiva
disappears,

00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:42.306
how can you exist? That’s one way.

00:15:42.507 --> 00:15:46.891
Second way is that those who are born
with Shiva tattwa,

00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:53.112
like our Sainath was, Shirdi Sainath,
or people like that -

00:15:53.313 --> 00:15:56.869
even the Devi sometimes can do that –

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.745
they drink away all the wines of the world,

00:15:59.946 --> 00:16:03.907
all the poisons of the world, like Shiva
did.

00:16:04.108 --> 00:16:10.845
So when Sainath found that so many people
were smoking this tobacco,

00:16:11.046 --> 00:16:13.935
he smoked all the tobacco of the world,

00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:18.543
tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra
so that nobody should get it.

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:23.916
That’s the style of Shiva to take all
the poison into Himself,

00:16:24.178 --> 00:16:28.457
and to absorb all the poison within
Himself.

00:16:28.658 --> 00:16:31.406
He can deal with the most difficult things.

00:16:31.607 --> 00:16:38.936
So the one dealing comes through the brain,
because Virata is in our brain,

00:16:39.137 --> 00:16:43.380
acts through the brain. So He plays tricks
on you.

00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:47.940
And that appeals to us because we can
see that He’s killed someone.

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:52.674
So we think, “Very nice Mother, You have
punished that person, it’s good.”

00:16:52.875 --> 00:17:00.128
But Shiva Tattwa gives you the problems
which normally you cannot see

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:06.705
but works out in a short time like that,
like heart troubles;

00:17:06.906 --> 00:17:13.806
or a person who has a very poor Shiva
Tattwa

00:17:14.007 --> 00:17:19.670
can have all the incurable diseases
of the world.

00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:27.608
There nobody is killed, but it’s every
minute the person is suffering.

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:31.661
That is the way Shiva corrects.

00:17:31.862 --> 00:17:39.265
In us, when Shiva Tattwa is awakened,
our priorities change absolutely.

00:17:39.466 --> 00:17:46.215
I see now that those who have come,
say, to India from the West,

00:17:46.416 --> 00:17:48.755
have changed quite a lot in their
priorities,

00:17:48.956 --> 00:17:54.940
but still there is not so much change
as it should be.

00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:57.213
They are, of course, thousand times better

00:17:57.414 --> 00:18:01.001
than their fellow beings who are not
realised souls.

00:18:01.202 --> 00:18:07.570
But still, attachment to things, attachment
to money is quite a lot.

00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.987
This detachment must work out.

00:18:11.188 --> 00:18:17.750
See, things are not correct in people
and the alertness is not there.

00:18:18.186 --> 00:18:21.399
To give a very, very gross example of this,
I’ll tell you

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:27.254
that, a gentleman, say, came and he was
told that,

00:18:27.455 --> 00:18:31.152
“You have to give, say, eleven rupees
for puja.”

00:18:31.353 --> 00:18:35.736
He said, “On principle we are not supposed
to give.”

00:18:35.937 --> 00:18:39.703
So I mean, you are only paying, even
on principle,

00:18:39.904 --> 00:18:45.429
you are only paying for your food and
lodging, not for puja.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.472
The other side of it, they will not even
see that,

00:18:48.673 --> 00:18:52.830
“Mother is spending so much for us extra
for which we are not paying anything.”

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.433
It’s not all found.

00:18:58.052 --> 00:19:02.151
Like the other day, I said that people are
now asking me to pay for this,

00:19:02.352 --> 00:19:06.056
then tomorrow they will say, “Pay for
our house rents.”

00:19:06.257 --> 00:19:09.510
It was so. It was such a condition, once
upon a time in London,

00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:13.108
when I started the ashram, that they asked
for all the utensils in the ashram,

00:19:13.309 --> 00:19:16.573
I paid for the rent, paid for everything.
And ultimately, they said,

00:19:16.774 --> 00:19:20.060
“We don’t have an ironing board, please
send us.”

00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:24.123
From that, it’s not so bad now, I mean,
of course.

00:19:26.967 --> 00:19:30.310
But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees
for taxi,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.506
they will think that, “Oh, we have to pay
for taxi, Mother is supposed to pay.”

00:19:33.707 --> 00:19:38.833
But if I pay 7000-8000 rupees for you to go
to Haridwar, that’s all right.

00:19:39.034 --> 00:19:44.350
that’s good, that nobody wants to find out
how Mother is paying for us.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.729
It’s surprising and this disturbs me
very much

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:57.881
that what is your attitude towards
this now.

00:19:59.128 --> 00:20:03.510
The pleasing should be done with full
heart.

00:20:03.711 --> 00:20:07.865
Say if you have to buy any presents
for your friends, or anything,

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:12.664
you don’t mind spending money for that;
but for puja you have objections.

00:20:12.865 --> 00:20:16.128
For your laundry you used to pay always,
I mean,

00:20:16.329 --> 00:20:19.377
I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed
how much money was spent.

00:20:19.578 --> 00:20:25.539
But 21 rupees, the principle was involved.
Imagine.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.550
Look at it. If you look at it, you will be
shocked at yourself.

00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:36.133
But that shows despite all this, you have
got your realisation.

00:20:36.334 --> 00:20:37.986
See the generosity.

00:20:38.187 --> 00:20:44.586
It’s very, very, you see, it’s very,
very gross. It’s very gross.

00:20:44.787 --> 00:20:51.689
So the detachment from this gross life
must go away.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.442
But an ordinary villager understands better

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:57.003
because he is innocent. He is innocent.

00:20:57.204 --> 00:21:00.742
Because you are not innocent, that’s why
you see everything from your mind.

00:21:00.943 --> 00:21:03.543
You think with it, “How much we paid,

00:21:03.744 --> 00:21:07.547
how much this is, this is that, this,
that.”

00:21:07.748 --> 00:21:12.791
But an innocent villager, even if he has
four annas,

00:21:12.992 --> 00:21:17.954
he would like to do something, “Mother,
that’s all I have.”

00:21:18.155 --> 00:21:21.564
We have a parable in the Bible.

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:24.649
And this is what it is. One should see

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:30.589
our detachment starts at a very baser
level of money.

00:21:33.245 --> 00:21:38.939
You need not have any friends. What is
the need to give to any friends?

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:45.310
What are these friends for?

00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:49.584
Except for Shiva Tattwa, what other friend
you need?

00:21:49.793 --> 00:21:54.742
Think of it, without God, what is your
life?

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.907
So the detachment must start.
The priorities must change,

00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:04.894
and you must know that God is the One
who is your Friend,

00:22:05.095 --> 00:22:08.993
who is your Father, who is your Mother,
who is to be worshipped.

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:14.269
There is nothing else. Tana, mana, dhana –
everything is for God.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.614
Of course, I don’t want anything from you,
you know that.

00:22:17.815 --> 00:22:24.685
But that should be the attitude
of a person.

00:22:27.367 --> 00:22:33.766
So the first – this attitude comes
in a person.

00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:37.302
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great
advantage

00:22:37.503 --> 00:22:39.947
that those who have developed this
attitude,

00:22:40.148 --> 00:22:43.187
have been helped so much materially

00:22:43.388 --> 00:22:48.695
that you find the proof of it, immediately.

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:53.668
The proof is there and those who do not
take to this kind of a thing, suffer.

00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:56.927
So the proof is there.

00:22:58.214 --> 00:23:08.715
I must give you an example of a goldsmith.

00:23:08.916 --> 00:23:12.418
I had given him something to be made
for the puja.

00:23:12.619 --> 00:23:15.215
A lot of gold was given, everything,

00:23:15.416 --> 00:23:21.779
and still, stupidly, he tried to make money
out of that.

00:23:22.096 --> 00:23:25.421
And he got cancer and he died.

00:23:25.622 --> 00:23:29.733
I didn’t do anything, but I knew he had
made money.

00:23:29.956 --> 00:23:33.051
I knew that all; I know lots of things.

00:23:33.252 --> 00:23:38.984
I didn’t say anything to him, nothing,
never, never even mentioned.

00:23:39.185 --> 00:23:42.785
He got cancer and he died; he is no more

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.196
because Shiva Tattva disappeared.
This was for a puja,

00:23:51.397 --> 00:23:57.630
the money of the saints, something was
to be made

00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:01.278
and he should not have done it. The proof
is just there.

00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:03.782
Now, those who knew him got a fright
of their lives,

00:24:03.983 --> 00:24:09.455
“Oh God, now no more of this from us
at least.”

00:24:13.415 --> 00:24:17.972
But those who have been surrendered
about their money part also –

00:24:18.173 --> 00:24:22.381
not that I take anything from you, nor
do I want anything from you –

00:24:22.582 --> 00:24:25.799
but still, the attitude I am saying is
different.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.022
Tthey have gone up, they have made money,
they are very rich,

00:24:29.223 --> 00:24:31.161
they are very well to do, they are
all right,

00:24:31.362 --> 00:24:35.490
they get so much blessings, everything.

00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:40.151
This is the first Nabhi chakra’s
detachment.

00:24:40.352 --> 00:24:44.792
We should start by putting Shiva on top.

00:24:47.122 --> 00:24:52.006
Every attachment can be attacked with
Shiva Tattwa,

00:24:52.651 --> 00:24:57.900
because Shiva Tattwa is brilliant like
a diamond, brilliant.

00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:02.032
Every facet can be cleansed out, very
simply

00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:06.568
through our Kundalini awakening and
through our alertness.

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:12.963
And one after that you can see there are
other attachments we have.

00:25:13.164 --> 00:25:18.899
This is friendship, sympathies,
friendships.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:25.112
Sympathies always go to a person who
is in need or something like that.

00:25:25.313 --> 00:25:29.886
You have known sympathies have tortured
so many people.

00:25:30.087 --> 00:25:33.812
The other way also could be that you hate
someone too much,

00:25:34.013 --> 00:25:37.918
you love someone too much, some sort
of a thing like that.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:43.796
So detachment comes that you do not hate,
nor you love anyone.

00:25:44.005 --> 00:25:47.123
You leave it to God to decide.

00:25:52.215 --> 00:25:54.627
That’s a kind of a detachment that
you leave it to God.

00:25:54.828 --> 00:25:58.598
“God, please” – that is His exploit.
“I am not going to judge.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:02.270
Only thing I judge them on Kundalini,
I awaken their Kundalini.

00:26:02.471 --> 00:26:05.130
If it works out, well and good, if it
doesn’t work out, well and good.”

00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:11.342
So you have detached yourself from
the responsibility of judging others.

00:26:11.543 --> 00:26:15.521
Only your judgment is on Kundalini,
if it works out, all right.

00:26:15.722 --> 00:26:21.208
But you are just like a barometer that’s
all, or like a machine that cures.

00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:25.181
You are not involved into it. So this
involvement into personal lives

00:26:25.382 --> 00:26:28.614
and personal relationships like mother,
sister, brother,

00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:32.099
every sort of a nonsense, must be taken
out.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.211
Now say, if your mother is not all right,

00:26:37.532 --> 00:26:42.003
you must just get after her and see
that she is put right.

00:26:42.204 --> 00:26:44.862
That’s very important; mother has
to be all right.

00:26:45.063 --> 00:26:47.289
If she’s not all right, you tell her,
“I’m not going to eat

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:52.126
food from your hand, finished. You get
your vibrations all right.”

00:26:52.403 --> 00:26:56.004
You tell her that, “You better take
to realisation,

00:26:56.205 --> 00:26:59.150
otherwise I will not have anything to do
with you.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.492
I’ll just come, see you, talk to you,
go away.”

00:27:02.693 --> 00:27:06.639
Show that detachment to her. Be strong.
You must cure your mother.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:13.112
Very important, because mother is a part
of Sahaja Yoga, it’s very important.

00:27:13.313 --> 00:27:17.613
But many people I have seen just do not
know how to resist.

00:27:17.814 --> 00:27:21.204
You must protest, go on protesting
one after another

00:27:21.405 --> 00:27:26.303
because that’s the greatest thing you are
doing for your mother.

00:27:26.504 --> 00:27:28.488
What else can you give it to her?

00:27:28.689 --> 00:27:32.270
Anything you give, the whole world,
has no meaning,

00:27:32.471 --> 00:27:41.854
except correcting your mother for the
better life, an eternal life, life of God.

00:27:46.462 --> 00:27:50.147
Then your wife – the wife is a very
dangerous situation.

00:27:50.348 --> 00:27:55.587
If the wife is negative, she will go on
putting into your head things,

00:27:55.788 --> 00:27:59.695
which will work out at a odd time, and you
will be amazed

00:27:59.896 --> 00:28:03.264
how you slipped out these things and how
you said these things,

00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:07.028
why should you have done it, why did
you do this.

00:28:07.229 --> 00:28:10.000
But the wife is to be told that, “You have
to behave yourself,

00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:14.990
you have to get all right, nothing doing,
and there is no compromise.

00:28:15.484 --> 00:28:17.109
You be in another room, I will be
in another room.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.429
You should get well. I am not going
to have…”

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:23.507
Because that is even much more dangerous,
because you know

00:28:23.708 --> 00:28:26.986
if the woman is catching,

00:28:27.187 --> 00:28:33.670
then there are very serious diseases who
develop with the Mooladhara problem.

00:28:34.203 --> 00:28:37.539
So you have to be strict with your wife.
You should make her,

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.016
you should say, “I’ll not eat any food
with your hands.

00:28:40.217 --> 00:28:43.418
I’ll have nothing to do, I’ll not talk
to you,

00:28:43.619 --> 00:28:46.292
I’ll just come and sleep in another room
and go out.

00:28:46.493 --> 00:28:49.918
You better not touch my clothes.

00:28:50.847 --> 00:28:54.937
If you don’t listen to me then I have
nothing to do with you.

00:28:55.138 --> 00:28:58.368
You better… I’m your husband,

00:28:58.569 --> 00:29:00.561
and whatever dharma I follow, you
have to follow,

00:29:00.762 --> 00:29:03.955
if you don’t want to listen to me, then
I have nothing to do with you.”

00:29:04.156 --> 00:29:06.950
The wife can also do the same thing
with the husband.

00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:10.588
Gradually showing indifference in a way
that he understands

00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:13.751
that it doesn’t bring love.

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:17.764
That’s how women corrected men
long time back.

00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:22.470
Nowadays, of course women, if you give
them something, they are get pleased.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.598
Even if there is a keep, as long as they
are giving diamonds to the wife,

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:31.722
she is quite pleased with the keep.
Still in India it’s not accepted.

00:29:31.923 --> 00:29:34.058
But I have seen in the West nobody minds.

00:29:34.259 --> 00:29:36.378
If the husband has ten keeps, doesn’t
matter,

00:29:36.579 --> 00:29:41.304
as long as he is giving you the money,
all right, nobody minds it.

00:29:41.505 --> 00:29:44.332
That’s very funny.

00:29:45.493 --> 00:29:51.147
So wife’s relation, mother’s relations,
husband’s relations,

00:29:51.348 --> 00:29:56.477
close relations must be corrected. And
children must be guarded.

00:29:56.678 --> 00:30:00.506
You shouldn’t allow your children to go
away to the wrong things.

00:30:00.707 --> 00:30:03.030
If they are doing wrong things, they are
not coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.347
you are duty bound;

00:30:04.548 --> 00:30:07.213
you should say, “I’m not going to pay you
any money, nothing doing.

00:30:07.414 --> 00:30:12.543
I’ll not see your faces, if you do not take
to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:18.297
What else are you going to give to your
children, but God?

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:27.622
You can do it. You all can do it.

00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:35.153
But one should know I need not do it.

00:30:35.354 --> 00:30:39.873
So many people say that, “Mother, Your
husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:30:40.074 --> 00:30:43.004
That’s all right. I know where to bring
him in;

00:30:43.205 --> 00:30:45.419
I know when to bring my children in;

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.057
because if they were in, everybody would
have said,

00:30:48.258 --> 00:30:53.349
“They have floated a family enterprise.”

00:30:59.803 --> 00:31:05.672
As long as they are out of it, it’s a very
good idea, specially in India.

00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:10.523
So best thing is if they oppose me, I keep
all of them out; my brothers…

00:31:10.724 --> 00:31:14.696
Imagine, my own brothers, my own –

00:31:14.897 --> 00:31:19.002
I mean, they all have tremendous respect
for me, no doubt.

00:31:19.203 --> 00:31:22.744
Even my brother said that, “Thank God,
You are staying in my room now,

00:31:22.945 --> 00:31:27.559
so the vibrations will be very good for me.
And what do You think of my vibrations?”

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.682
Everything he says, but he is not
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:30.883 --> 00:31:33.153
I have given realisation to all of them,
everything is there,

00:31:33.354 --> 00:31:35.528
but they are not Sahaja Yogis – a part
of this.

00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:39.223
Otherwise they will be in charge of money,
you see.

00:31:39.424 --> 00:31:41.202
“What money you get? Now, come along,

00:31:41.403 --> 00:31:45.888
this is the money we have”, all
the problems.

00:31:46.089 --> 00:31:48.621
With all these relations around, you don’t
know.

00:31:48.822 --> 00:31:50.766
Somebody will go and say, “Shri Mataji
said so.”

00:31:50.967 --> 00:31:54.950
“Oh, that’s the daughter of Mataji has
said” – so that becomes rule.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:32:00.379
I don’t want all these pressures on my
head.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.479
That’s the best way; I wish our politicians
understand that:

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:11.059
never have your relations around. That’s
the best way to administer.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.855
If you have your relations around, then you
will never do right things.

00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:21.918
Or even if you do right things, your
relations will spoil it.

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:25.231
So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know

00:32:25.432 --> 00:32:29.043
that you should not try to help your
relations

00:32:29.244 --> 00:32:34.028
in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:32:34.282 --> 00:32:37.164
Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:32:37.365 --> 00:32:42.350
you bring your mother and make her sit
in front of me.

00:32:42.745 --> 00:32:51.283
First correct her vibrations. Put her right
and then bring her.

00:32:52.254 --> 00:32:54.528
“Correct my father, correct my mother…”,

00:32:54.729 --> 00:32:58.623
is not Mother’s responsibility, it’s your
own.

00:32:58.824 --> 00:33:02.111
When they are all right, then as you bring
flowers to me,

00:33:02.312 --> 00:33:09.365
bring your relations as a very good present
from your family.

00:33:09.566 --> 00:33:15.117
That’s a much better thing than to be like
this that I have to clear.

00:33:15.318 --> 00:33:19.590
If one is a Sahaja Yogi, all his three
generations up and down,

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.762
this side and that side I have to cure;
that is done.

00:33:23.963 --> 00:33:28.458
Like Malhotra made me do.

00:33:30.042 --> 00:33:33.558
So one should detach from these family ties

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:38.816
and these emotional imbalances we have,
emotional problems we have

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:46.571
by understanding that the only thing that
these people should have is Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:50.265
And some people should not be in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:33:50.466 --> 00:33:57.110
Like as I said my own husband, and my
daughter and my relations, I keep them out.

00:33:58.084 --> 00:34:01.349
All such people if there are any, you
should not also have them

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:07.174
anywhere near Sahaja Yoga. You should be
discrete to find out.

00:34:08.423 --> 00:34:12.494
Although, all these, my relations are very
dharmic people, extremely dharmic,

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:16.345
very good, very self-respecting, all
qualities they have got –

00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:22.285
everything, readymade, but they are not
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:27.176
So none of you can say, “Somebody said so,
so one said so.”

00:34:27.377 --> 00:34:31.510
It has to be: “Mother has to say.”

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.818
This detachment has to come. It takes time,
especially with Indians.

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:41.795
All the time they are worried about their
children, or a mother or a father.

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:44.350
Go on and on and on and on and on,

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:51.741
see, years together, “my son, my daughter,
my son, my father” – all the time.

00:34:51.942 --> 00:34:57.566
Now by God’s grace so many have got rid
of all their responsibilities somehow,

00:34:57.767 --> 00:34:59.776
through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is.

00:34:59.977 --> 00:35:02.372
So they are now settled down onto
themselves,

00:35:02.573 --> 00:35:05.051
because you are your own responsibility.

00:35:05.252 --> 00:35:09.499
So this detachment must be brought, those
who are coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:16.030
that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga
blessings. We are going to be blessings.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.609
With that pride if you’ll be in the family,

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.330
“All right, if you want to have Sahaja
Yoga, you have it”,

00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:24.262
but not to force them on Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:24.463 --> 00:35:26.299
But you can force Sahaja Yoga on them;

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.854
the stage has come that you have to talk
about Sahaja Yoga to them.

00:35:29.055 --> 00:35:31.349
In the beginning I used to say, “Don’t talk
to them.”

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.340
But those who are useless, if they are not
to be brought in Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:37.162
tell them, “You are not good for Sahaja
Yoga, better not ask me.”

00:35:37.363 --> 00:35:41.485
Then they will come. Some people you should
show complete indifference,

00:35:41.686 --> 00:35:44.036
“You are incapable, you are no good, you
are too materialistic.”

00:35:44.237 --> 00:35:48.574
Then that person will say, “I will prove
that I am.”

00:35:56.926 --> 00:36:00.926
All these detachments take place

00:36:01.127 --> 00:36:06.350
and then the detachments are at Nabhi
chakras,

00:36:06.551 --> 00:36:10.152
you rise up to your emotional side at
the Heart chakra.

00:36:10.353 --> 00:36:17.597
And then you have to have the detachment
even of a kind of a collectivity,

00:36:17.798 --> 00:36:21.600
that we think it’s collectivity.

00:36:21.801 --> 00:36:28.575
I call the fraternity of the bhoots, not
collectivity.

00:36:28.776 --> 00:36:35.196
Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will
form a group;

00:36:35.577 --> 00:36:46.665
and they’ll have a very strong objection
to everything that is sensible,

00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:49.391
and they will have suggestions for
everything.

00:36:49.592 --> 00:36:56.106
There has to be no suggestions at all.

00:36:56.307 --> 00:37:01.596
There are no alternatives because Shiva
is absolute.

00:37:01.797 --> 00:37:08.014
Once one said is said. You just do it and
see – that’s the best.

00:37:08.215 --> 00:37:14.571
Alternatives will be second best or third
best or maybe useless.

00:37:14.944 --> 00:37:19.270
But there is no alternative for Shiva
Tattwa.

00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:27.493
I’ll give an example, I told Delhi people
that, “You organise, say,

00:37:27.694 --> 00:37:31.799
programme for seven days outside,
with other people.”

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.439
It was sensible because I knew it was
to rain. And it has to rain also.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.823
Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain
for all the other villagers, you see.

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:43.827
We cannot stop them for only Sahaja Yogis,
can we?

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:45.758
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important,
so I said,

00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:48.611
“Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis.”

00:37:48.812 --> 00:37:51.318
Now they started an alternative, only
thinking that

00:37:51.518 --> 00:37:54.298
you see, they won’t be comfortable and…

00:37:54.499 --> 00:37:57.929
I mean it was good, but on a other level,

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.948
that they will not be comfortable with
Sahaja Yogis, another level.

00:38:02.149 --> 00:38:04.525
But there has to be understanding if Mother
has said it,

00:38:04.726 --> 00:38:06.645
it must be done, whatever it is.

00:38:06.846 --> 00:38:10.228
Even if She says, “You kill somebody”,
you have to kill.

00:38:10.429 --> 00:38:17.054
Keep it like that, to that extent. Keep
to the maximum.

00:38:17.255 --> 00:38:22.465
Even if She says, “You have to die now”,
you should die.

00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:31.202
If She says, “All right, you tell lies”,
“All right, I’ll tell lies.”

00:38:31.403 --> 00:38:34.858
Like Radhaji, She said, “What is my punyas,
what is my papas?

00:38:35.059 --> 00:38:39.893
I am in His heart. What can I do?”
Whatever He does, She just does.

00:38:40.094 --> 00:38:42.897
That is Shiva Tattwa.

00:38:43.098 --> 00:38:48.548
When it is awakened, you see, it at least
recognises this Shiva in me.

00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:53.065
And it sees that this is Shiva Tattwa.

00:38:53.266 --> 00:38:55.839
It understands because at Shiva Tattwa

00:38:56.039 --> 00:39:01.500
you don’t commit any sins, you are sinless.

00:39:01.816 --> 00:39:07.137
When you are the Spirit, you are sinless;
there is no sin in you.

00:39:07.338 --> 00:39:11.126
If, supposing according to human
understanding,

00:39:11.327 --> 00:39:13.978
if Shiva leaves a person dies, then
it’s sinful.

00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:16.757
Why to leave anybody? It’s sinful,
isn’t it?

00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:20.095
For all common purposes, common
understanding, we’ll think

00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:26.023
that it is sinful for Shiva to leave
the person and make the person die.

00:39:26.224 --> 00:39:29.931
For example, a lady dies, her children
are left behind,

00:39:30.132 --> 00:39:34.802
then one can blame Shiva for that, that,
“See now, You went away, and these children

00:39:35.003 --> 00:39:40.251
are now without a mother or without
a father”, something like that.

00:39:40.452 --> 00:39:45.257
Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does
is sinless.

00:39:45.458 --> 00:39:49.866
So whatever you do is sinless. The idea
of sin is finished

00:39:50.067 --> 00:39:57.397
because who commits sin is your ego.
Ego commits sin.

00:39:57.598 --> 00:40:00.680
But if you have no ego, there’s no sin,

00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:06.523
because you are not doing anything,
you stand in akarma.

00:40:06.724 --> 00:40:09.871
Say the sun is shining, is shining sharp,

00:40:10.072 --> 00:40:14.446
and somebody wants to stand in the sun,
then he gets burns.

00:40:14.647 --> 00:40:19.491
It’s not the fault of the sun, the sun
is shining,

00:40:19.692 --> 00:40:23.646
that’s the job of sun.

00:40:23.847 --> 00:40:27.557
Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is
doing it. He is not sinful.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:32.013
It’s our mental attitude makes us think,
“This is sin”, “this is not sin”.

00:40:32.214 --> 00:40:35.986
But when we have ego, we are committing
sins.

00:40:36.187 --> 00:40:41.626
If you ask a tiger, “You are committing
a sin because you are eating a cow.”

00:40:41.827 --> 00:40:47.736
He will say, “I never knew what a sin was.
I don’t know what sin is.”

00:40:47.937 --> 00:40:52.503
It’s a story when some missionaries were
going away from a village, you see.

00:40:52.704 --> 00:40:56.412
So the villagers, poor, innocent you know,
they just got up to thank them.

00:40:56.613 --> 00:41:00.011
They said, “Thank God, when you came here,
you told us there is sin.

00:41:00.212 --> 00:41:03.564
We didn’t know what sin was.”

00:41:04.374 --> 00:41:09.059
For innocent people, they don’t know what
is sin.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.008
Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin.

00:41:12.209 --> 00:41:17.268
It obeys the other source of innocence.

00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:20.653
So there is no sin for a person who is
the Spirit.

00:41:20.854 --> 00:41:23.924
For Shiva there is no sin, whether He wants
to give

00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:29.015
His blessings to a rakshasa or to a saint.

00:41:29.216 --> 00:41:34.602
There is no sin for Him, because He
is Bholenath.

00:41:34.803 --> 00:41:38.185
He is beyond, He is beyond sin.

00:41:38.386 --> 00:41:41.958
Whatever He does, He is beyond sin,

00:41:42.159 --> 00:41:46.153
because ego cannot envelope Him.
There is no ego.

00:41:46.354 --> 00:41:50.707
Because we have ego, we commit sins.

00:41:52.036 --> 00:41:57.188
Once ego is finished, we are no more there,
so who commits sins?

00:41:57.389 --> 00:42:00.794
When we are not there, who is committing
the sin?

00:42:00.995 --> 00:42:06.110
Shiva can’t commit sins, so we are
the Shiva, so we cannot commit sins.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.550
So all these ideas of giving alternatives

00:42:09.751 --> 00:42:12.888
at the mental level, is also wrong.

00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:17.439
I give any – anything I say, immediately
there will be ten suggestions.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.395
I try all these tricks with you,

00:42:20.596 --> 00:42:24.903
because you are used to conferences,
you see.

00:42:28.114 --> 00:42:33.537
So I said, “All right, Subramanian, what
do you have to say about it?”

00:42:35.493 --> 00:42:39.621
Because after all, lord Subramanian
is there, must ask him.

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:47.627
Then I ask Venugopalan, then I’ll ask
Gavin, Warren, all these people,

00:42:47.828 --> 00:42:53.392
“Now, what do you have to say?” And
then they give their suggestions.

00:42:53.593 --> 00:43:05.573
But if you see, in the conference of all
the divine Deities,

00:43:05.795 --> 00:43:11.242
there is no suggestion, no suggestion,
no alternative.

00:43:11.443 --> 00:43:14.921
No alternatives to your Mother’s ideas,
nothing.

00:43:15.122 --> 00:43:17.821
Absolute, it’s absolute.

00:43:18.037 --> 00:43:23.040
Nobody gives any suggestions to me,
never.

00:43:24.917 --> 00:43:27.691
No question.

00:43:29.987 --> 00:43:33.202
They won’t listen to you, they won’t listen
to anyone.

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:39.291
There’s no question. Such harmony;
complete obedience.

00:43:41.269 --> 00:43:45.733
And not only they are fixed with their
qualities.

00:43:45.934 --> 00:43:50.204
If they are told that, “You have to do it”,
they’ll do it.

00:43:52.172 --> 00:43:57.298
This is the difference. Then try.

00:43:57.515 --> 00:44:00.741
Sometimes it appears, you see –
if I say, “All right,

00:44:00.942 --> 00:44:05.586
go this way and you will find the place”,
but you won’t find.

00:44:05.787 --> 00:44:08.110
So you will say, “See, Mother, You said
to go this way,

00:44:08.311 --> 00:44:10.863
that’s why we went this way and we didn’t
find the church.”

00:44:11.064 --> 00:44:14.614
Now there it is not that I’m saying that
you will find the church,

00:44:14.815 --> 00:44:20.102
it is I am trying to see what you think.

00:44:20.303 --> 00:44:24.976
I am telling you my own tricks, all right,
so be careful.

00:44:25.779 --> 00:44:30.559
I’ll tell you although, “Go this way. Now,
you didn’t find the church, I’m sorry.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.454
I should not have told you. Or you should
have gone that (way).”

00:44:33.655 --> 00:44:36.350
But that’s not true. I must tell you,
that’s not true.

00:44:36.551 --> 00:44:40.831
What I am trying to see, what you are
saying about this.

00:44:41.032 --> 00:44:45.112
Now if you are clever, you would say,
“I went there,

00:44:45.313 --> 00:44:49.428
I didn’t see the place, but I saw something
else, Mother.

00:44:49.629 --> 00:44:52.608
That’s the reason You sent me there. Now
I know why You sent me there.”

00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:57.183
That’s it. Then I know that he is Sahaja
Yogi.

00:44:57.421 --> 00:45:01.822
But if you say, “Oh, I went there because
I thought I will find this thing,

00:45:02.023 --> 00:45:06.405
but, it was not there, and You sent me,
You sent me”, finished.

00:45:06.606 --> 00:45:10.926
If you say that, “You said so and it
happened.”

00:45:11.127 --> 00:45:16.265
Oh, I did say, no doubt, but what I said
was just to play a trick on you,

00:45:16.466 --> 00:45:20.976
because one of the natures of your Mother
is Mahamaya. So be careful.

00:45:21.177 --> 00:45:25.326
How you react is very important for me
to see how far you have gone.

00:45:25.527 --> 00:45:29.470
This is one of the ways you are judged.

00:45:31.427 --> 00:45:34.617
But for a villager, it’s a different thing
if you see.

00:45:34.818 --> 00:45:41.045
If I tell him, “Now if you want me to go
to that village,

00:45:41.246 --> 00:45:48.306
see, take the cart, or take the bullock
cart this way”, he’ll take it.

00:45:48.507 --> 00:45:52.962
But there will be a ditch, so I’ll get hit.

00:45:53.163 --> 00:46:00.427
So he will say, “Mother, I’m sorry, you
got hit. But I could have avoided it.”

00:46:00.628 --> 00:46:03.283
You see, so he takes the responsibility
upon himself.

00:46:03.484 --> 00:46:05.977
He takes everything upon himself.
“Because you asked me,

00:46:06.178 --> 00:46:12.246
so I had to go that way, but I could have
avoided it if I was careful.”

00:46:13.227 --> 00:46:15.702
So this is the difference you know, not
to put responsibility.

00:46:15.903 --> 00:46:19.260
It’s a common human nature is to put
responsibility on somebody else.

00:46:19.461 --> 00:46:21.770
Best is to put on Mother.

00:46:21.971 --> 00:46:28.510
But in that you lose all your punyas.

00:46:29.942 --> 00:46:34.134
So, “The responsibility is mine. I must
have done some mistake.

00:46:34.335 --> 00:46:37.217
I must have done some mistake somewhere

00:46:37.418 --> 00:46:42.492
or else maybe that Mother wants me to learn
something in this.”

00:46:42.693 --> 00:46:46.273
Every time you do something, I tell you
something,

00:46:46.474 --> 00:46:50.040
it’s just for you to learn something.
I don’t have to learn anything.

00:46:50.241 --> 00:46:55.258
Do you think that way, that I have to learn
something now anymore? Not anymore.

00:46:55.459 --> 00:46:59.230
So you have to learn something. And that
is what if you understand,

00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:03.944
then a kind of a detachment will build
in you and a surrender.

00:47:04.145 --> 00:47:08.172
You will be amazed that you will be
so much relieved

00:47:08.373 --> 00:47:14.320
of nonsensical headaches that you have
and the burdens you carry.

00:47:14.648 --> 00:47:21.095
If you understand that, “The whole joke,
the whole work,

00:47:21.296 --> 00:47:26.565
the whole drama is done by Mother and
I am just playing into it.”

00:47:26.793 --> 00:47:33.943
It’s so simple. That is to be felt, to be
understood.

00:47:34.693 --> 00:47:37.089
And the enjoyment lies in that,

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:41.181
not in judging or finding alternatives.

00:47:41.382 --> 00:47:46.694
You try it. Those who have tried it have
enjoyed it very much and so many things.

00:47:46.895 --> 00:47:50.118
Every minute, I'll give you an example
of that.

00:47:50.319 --> 00:47:53.916
I’ll give you an example of Gregoire last
time I went to his house.

00:47:54.117 --> 00:47:56.689
He tortured my life for his wife.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.486
“When will she have her delivery?
How will she have,

00:47:59.687 --> 00:48:03.300
who is going to stay with her?” Morning
till evening, he had one talk.

00:48:03.501 --> 00:48:05.763
“All right”, I said, “something will be
done.

00:48:05.964 --> 00:48:08.765
You can have this lady to stay...”
“But then how will I go to India?”

00:48:08.966 --> 00:48:11.895
I mean, “I” was so important.

00:48:12.096 --> 00:48:14.306
Then he didn’t realise that time, you see.

00:48:14.507 --> 00:48:17.749
He thought it was so important to do
that way.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:20.065
Ultimately quite before going, I told him,

00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:23.758
“Gregoire, you troubled me too much this
time, but it’s all right.”

00:48:23.959 --> 00:48:26.077
So he said, “I’m sorry.”

00:48:26.278 --> 00:48:31.310
Then he telephoned me one day saying,
“Mother, my wife is in for abortion.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.381
She has gone to the hospital, there is
no chance.” I said, “Forget it.

00:48:35.582 --> 00:48:38.003
You go back to the hospital, she will be
all right.”

00:48:38.204 --> 00:48:41.150
So he went to the hospital, they said,
“A miracle.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:46.647
She’s perfectly all right, there’s no
problem. She’s all right.”

00:48:46.848 --> 00:48:49.174
So it came into his head, as he told me,

00:48:49.375 --> 00:48:52.486
“Oh, Mother is looking after it, why should
I worry?

00:48:52.687 --> 00:48:55.529
Why should I have worried Her?”
This is first thing.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:03.343
Then, the child was born earlier than time
and he came to India.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:08.526
So also I convince you that what I say,
what I do,

00:49:08.727 --> 00:49:11.872
you know that, that I look after you.

00:49:12.073 --> 00:49:16.782
But when you take up responsibility upon
yourself and start thinking about it,

00:49:16.983 --> 00:49:22.827
then I cannot help. So just know that,
leave it to God.

00:49:23.028 --> 00:49:25.848
It’s all for your good, for your ‘hita’.

00:49:26.049 --> 00:49:28.373
Everything is for your ‘hita’, whatever
it is.

00:49:28.574 --> 00:49:32.863
Sometimes I have to shout at you, sometimes
I have to correct you,

00:49:33.064 --> 00:49:35.629
sometimes I have to tell you that,
“Don’t come here.”

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.879
Some people who touch me, you see, can
give me horrible sensations.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.596
Then I say, “You just don’t come here.
You don’t stand before me,

00:49:42.797 --> 00:49:45.169
you get out from here.” That helps them.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:47.513
But if they stand there, the bhoots will
never leave

00:49:47.714 --> 00:49:51.455
because the bhoots want to trouble me.

00:49:53.086 --> 00:49:56.126
So this point if you understand, you will
get completely detached

00:49:56.327 --> 00:50:00.019
and we’ll know that for our good, for our
betterment

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.072
we must keep Mother pleased and these
things if we do, by displeasing Her,

00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:07.995
we are going to be finished.

00:50:08.196 --> 00:50:12.977
Now to understand this, what you need –
not age, not position,

00:50:13.178 --> 00:50:21.660
not your qualifications, nothing – you need
a wise mind, deep personality.

00:50:21.861 --> 00:50:25.521
I’ve seen very young people are so sensible
though their parents are stupid,

00:50:25.722 --> 00:50:28.350
absolutely stupid people.

00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:31.679
So you just need a wise, deep personality
to do it

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.919
and that you should try to develop.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.069
That comes only sticking onto Shiva tattwa,
which is a solid thing,

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:45.034
which is Shiva, Achala which doesn’t
move, absolute.

00:50:45.235 --> 00:50:47.870
It is not relative, it’s not relative
at all,

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:53.114
it’s not related to anything, absolute.
That gives you the depth,

00:50:53.315 --> 00:50:59.192
that depth which is required to settle
down, to go deep into you.

00:50:59.393 --> 00:51:03.816
Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that
gives you the gravity

00:51:04.017 --> 00:51:08.576
to go straight down deep into it.

00:51:08.936 --> 00:51:12.270
[Aside: Marathi]

00:51:21.553 --> 00:51:26.219
That is very important. And all this I hope

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:34.176
with the puja today we’ll try to settle you

00:51:34.377 --> 00:51:38.830
into that great principle of Shiva.

00:51:39.031 --> 00:51:43.827
Let your attention, every particle of your
attention be filled,

00:51:44.028 --> 00:51:58.133
sparkled and rejoice by that blessing
of Shiva Tattva.

00:51:58.847 --> 00:52:03.045
I bless you all. May God bless you.

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:12.956
So to begin with, we are going to worship
the Devi first of all,

00:52:13.157 --> 00:52:16.170
and then the Shiva.

00:52:16.411 --> 00:52:19.737
[Aside: Hindi for some minutes]

00:56:16.846 --> 00:56:19.966
So first we will have Ganesha’s Avahanam,

00:56:20.174 --> 00:56:24.255
means we have to establish Shri Ganesha,
that is important.

00:56:24.456 --> 00:56:31.555
And then, after that we have to say
the names of Vishnu, whatever –

00:56:31.756 --> 00:56:38.119
because His names are to be said which
are the ascending names.

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:46.517
And after that we will be having
the location and everything described

00:56:46.718 --> 00:56:50.820
where we are doing it, why we are
doing it, the puja.

00:56:51.021 --> 00:56:56.366
Then we’ll worship Devi. We take 108 names
of the Devi.

00:56:56.567 --> 00:57:00.131
I think you all should remember these
108 names by heart.

00:57:00.332 --> 00:57:04.390
Have you got printed Devi’s names?

00:57:04.591 --> 00:57:08.126
Gavin, have you got copies?

00:57:10.246 --> 00:57:12.175
You have got them?

00:57:12.376 --> 00:57:16.158
Have you got these with you? Do you
have booklets?

00:57:16.359 --> 00:57:19.843
Yogi: No, Mother.
Shri Mataji: (Hindi) Only one.
