00:52:17.128 --> 00:52:20.128
Please be seated.

00:52:26.848 --> 00:52:31.188
He's finished it? What happened?

00:52:33.568 --> 00:52:36.568
He's finished now?

00:53:00.088 --> 00:53:05.268
[UNCLEAR] Have you finished or ...

00:53:05.508 --> 00:53:09.128
I have finished. Mother, I meant that I just mentioned realization..

00:53:54.028 --> 00:53:58.088
[UNCLEAR] All right, thank you.

00:54:04.728 --> 00:54:08.268
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:54:14.788 --> 00:54:20.608
Yesterday, I explained to you, that

00:54:21.188 --> 00:54:26.608
this power lies within you, is your own power

00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:33.748
and once it is manifested, you will know how great you are.

00:54:34.128 --> 00:54:41.108
Just now, you are just thinking that you are an ordinary human-being

00:54:42.188 --> 00:54:45.228
but once you are connected to the mains,

00:54:46.368 --> 00:54:52.368
then you realize what you are. Like this instrument is

00:54:52.608 --> 00:54:59.268
without it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning - and then you understand your meaning.

00:55:00.508 --> 00:55:05.688
From human level to a higher level you have to move

00:55:06.168 --> 00:55:10.628
to know what is Divinity is.

00:55:13.708 --> 00:55:19.588
This is a happening, this is  a becoming.

00:55:19.868 --> 00:55:26.588
Like a seed becomes a tree through a living process, you have to become the Spirit.

00:55:26.808 --> 00:55:29.748
Yesterday I told you,

00:55:30.028 --> 00:55:36.888
that I will be able to tell you today about the nature of the Spirit; What is the Spirit?

00:55:37.848 --> 00:55:45.308
Of course, English language as you know, has it's limitations. Spirit means Atman -

00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:53.688
the Spirit which is the reflection of God. Also spirit means alcohol,

00:55:54.008 --> 00:55:58.888
also it means the spirit which is a dead thing.

00:55:59.988 --> 00:56:06.128
So, we have to now know, only about the Atman, the One

00:56:06.408 --> 00:56:10.188
which is the Self within ourselves.

00:56:13.748 --> 00:56:19.448
When you are enlightened by the awakening of this power within you

00:56:20.808 --> 00:56:28.268
then, the light of the Spirit comes into your attention

00:56:28.908 --> 00:56:33.148
and then your attention becomes enlightened.

00:56:34.408 --> 00:56:39.988
Through our Central Nervous System we express our attention

00:56:40.428 --> 00:56:44.448
but in this nervous system

00:56:45.508 --> 00:56:51.788
we have limitations. Firstly, we do not know the Absolute, the Absolute Truth -

00:56:52.328 --> 00:56:55.408
we live in a relative world.

00:56:56.188 --> 00:57:03.608
But once the Spirit shines your attention, you see everything clearly.

00:57:04.008 --> 00:57:11.348
For example, we are all sitting here, there is light, we can see each other, we know how to relate to each other

00:57:11.908 --> 00:57:15.688
and if we have to walk or to sit down,

00:57:16.068 --> 00:57:21.808
we know where to sit because we can see everything clearly but when

00:57:22.188 --> 00:57:28.668
we're not enlightened, whatever ideas we have are mostly mental or emotional

00:57:29.688 --> 00:57:35.268
or sometimes coming from our conditioning or from our ego.

00:57:36.208 --> 00:57:43.088
They do not relate to the Absolute and sometimes not at all to the reality.

00:57:44.248 --> 00:57:49.388
So you have to reach the point where you get the Absolute knowledge.

00:57:49.668 --> 00:57:55.268
Like, just now, I'm sitting before you, you all can see it - it's an Absolute knowledge, you know that I'm sitting here.

00:57:57.408 --> 00:58:01.808
But you will not know whether

00:58:03.028 --> 00:58:06.308
you should have divorce or not,

00:58:07.588 --> 00:58:11.748
whether this person is suffering from some madness,

00:58:12.228 --> 00:58:18.508
or the other person who call himself a guru, is a real guru or false guru - you will not know.

00:58:18.888 --> 00:58:26.348
By reasoning you will not know, by rationality you will not know - you cannot find out about a person through rationality

00:58:27.188 --> 00:58:33.848
so, there must be some method by which we can get the proof of what

00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:41.588
is there really existing. So when the attention gets enlightened -

00:58:43.308 --> 00:58:51.288
you have felt the other day the cool breeze on your finger-tips and you felt the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area.

00:58:52.148 --> 00:58:58.388
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, I said and the Holy Ghost is this All-Pervading power

00:58:58.848 --> 00:59:02.168
which is reflected in us as this Kundalini.

00:59:03.568 --> 00:59:10.588
So when you know the Absolute, then you can feel it on your finger-tips,

00:59:10.948 --> 00:59:15.228
your own centers and centers of another person,

00:59:15.748 --> 00:59:23.728
so that you become collectively conscious. Means your consciousness develops a new awareness

00:59:24.748 --> 00:59:30.968
where you are collectively conscious - you know about yourself and you know about others.

00:59:31.448 --> 00:59:34.508
Now you have to only know, how to correct

00:59:36.128 --> 00:59:43.608
the centers, which you have found out to be out of place or something wrong with them or constricted.

00:59:44.788 --> 00:59:48.948
If you know how to do it, then you can get cured

00:59:49.328 --> 00:59:55.968
and you can cure other people, not on physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual level.

00:59:56.528 --> 01:00:01.248
All this could be done, very easily, by you, once you get your Self-realization.

01:00:01.908 --> 01:00:05.988
Without that you cannot do it

01:00:06.988 --> 01:00:12.968
because you do not have the idea of the inner problem that exists.

01:00:16.928 --> 01:00:21.908
Supposing there's a tree which is sick and you want to treat it.

01:00:22.648 --> 01:00:29.808
No use treating that tree through the leaves, through the branches, through the fruits or through the flowers.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:35.168
Best thing is to go to the roots and this is the knowledge of the roots.

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:41.968
We have the knowledge of the tree. This great civilization has grown so big

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:49.388
but it has not found out it's roots as yet. But as the tree was growing so big,

01:00:49.928 --> 01:00:57.308
also the roots were growing inside and this is the knowledge of the roots, which one has to

01:00:57.808 --> 01:01:02.608
just now, listen to it with an open mind as a hypothesis.

01:01:03.548 --> 01:01:06.688
So, when these roots are within us -

01:01:07.008 --> 01:01:12.868
is described in the Bible as the tree of life. I mean, I'm not telling something which was not described.

01:01:14.968 --> 01:01:20.448
Also, this is said that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames,"

01:01:20.688 --> 01:01:25.068
and that's how all these chakras look like tongues of flames, specially

01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:32.208
the Sahastrara, the last chakra looks like beautiful flames of seven colors

01:01:32.608 --> 01:01:40.488
and they're burning so smoothly, as if there's no heat in it but some sort of a peace.

01:01:43.188 --> 01:01:49.128
All this, whatever I'm saying, has to have a proof and that proof you can only get

01:01:49.428 --> 01:01:56.108
when you transcend this human awareness into your spiritual awareness.

01:01:56.908 --> 01:02:02.348
So the first thing that happens to you, that you become collectively conscious.

01:02:03.048 --> 01:02:10.288
The second thing, I told you, that you become thoughtlessly aware - to begin with - means you can remain in the present

01:02:10.508 --> 01:02:15.448
without thinking. Whenever you want you can think, whenever you don't want you need not think.

01:02:16.488 --> 01:02:20.648
As a result of that you become a very peaceful personality.

01:02:21.628 --> 01:02:28.628
If there's a crisis, suddenly you jump into that position where you're thoughtlessly aware.

01:02:29.368 --> 01:02:36.168
Like, as I told you yesterday, that if you're standing in the sea water, you're afraid of the waves

01:02:36.468 --> 01:02:42.228
but if you get to the boat you can see all that. In the same way,

01:02:42.708 --> 01:02:46.868
you just jump on to that state of mind -

01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:53.688
mind is a wrong word, I should say, because you go beyond mind also - but you go into that state of being

01:02:54.208 --> 01:02:58.848
where you just see the whole thing as a play - you become a witness.

01:02:59.288 --> 01:03:06.288
You become a witness of the whole play and because you're outside the problem, you can solve it much better.

01:03:06.648 --> 01:03:13.748
Also you have a Divine help by which you can solve your problems and the problems of others.

01:03:14.828 --> 01:03:21.288
So the third thing which is very important for the Spirit, is that you know the truth.

01:03:22.788 --> 01:03:30.808
Put ten children together who are realized souls and tie their eyes and ask somebody to face.

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:39.988
The children will immediately show the same finger, all of them. Supposing they show this finger, you go and ask the person,

01:03:40.128 --> 01:03:47.028
"Have you got some trouble with your throat?" "Yes I have, I have a throat cancer but how do you know?"

01:03:47.408 --> 01:03:53.908
"Because these children have told us. These children what have they told us - just the finger which was burning very badly.

01:03:54.268 --> 01:04:02.308
So, must be the cancer or could be some serious because it's burning so badly." And they start, children will start rubbing them and clearing them.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:10.208
When you know gradually through experience

01:04:10.668 --> 01:04:16.808
that whatever you are recording on your hands is the truth,

01:04:17.508 --> 01:04:21.688
then you start accepting it as the truth,

01:04:22.568 --> 01:04:28.088
then your awareness that is human awareness goes to a new awareness called as vibratory awareness.

01:04:28.468 --> 01:04:35.328
When your hands are vibrating, you're feeling this cool breeze in your hand and you can feel

01:04:36.188 --> 01:04:43.388
your own centers and the centers of others - sometimes they burn, sometimes you get a kind of a tingling,

01:04:43.608 --> 01:04:48.928
sometimes you get pins and needles or sometimes you also get little burning.

01:04:49.628 --> 01:04:55.928
If it's a very horrid person, then might get a little blister for a while just to indicate - you become like a barometer.

01:04:56.168 --> 01:05:01.488
But you don't feel bad about it because you just feel it like a barometer and you know what's the problem

01:05:01.728 --> 01:05:04.968
with the other person is and also your own problem.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:10.568
So, you know the truth about everything. You want to find out about anyone,

01:05:10.928 --> 01:05:18.208
you want to know about any book, you want to know about any kind of a knowledge

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:26.268
if it is true or not - you have to just put your hands and ask, "Is this the truth?"

01:05:27.828 --> 01:05:35.228
"Is there God?" Many people say, "We don't believe in God." I think, is very unscientific to say like that, "We don't believe in God."

01:05:35.728 --> 01:05:40.608
Because you have not yet found it out. Unless and until you found out there is God or not,

01:05:40.808 --> 01:05:45.208
how can you say that, "I don't believe in God," - it is great arrogance, I think.

01:05:45.688 --> 01:05:50.308
So is best is, to find out. If you ask a question, "Is there God," -

01:05:50.508 --> 01:05:54.648
if you are realized soul,  immediately you'll start getting tremendous vibrations.

01:05:56.228 --> 01:06:01.488
That is how it works and gradually, you don't have to

01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:08.168
see on your vibrations but you just know the truth - you just know it what is the truth.

01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:15.148
Immediately as soon as you see the person, you know about him, as soon as you listen to someone, you know about him -

01:06:15.668 --> 01:06:22.388
it's becomes very clear and vivid. There's no problem then how to find out

01:06:22.728 --> 01:06:28.308
what is the truth - so you get all the proofs of it, all the proofs of it.

01:06:29.048 --> 01:06:32.108
Now the third thing,

01:06:33.388 --> 01:06:38.628
which I've told you, is the spiritual part of it.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:44.348
Of course, you become a witness, you become absolutely peaceful

01:06:44.908 --> 01:06:50.048
and the most important thing that you get is the joy.

01:06:51.028 --> 01:06:55.488
Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness.

01:06:56.208 --> 01:06:59.568
Unhappiness comes when your ego is hurt

01:06:59.908 --> 01:07:04.868
or your conditionings are hurt, your emotions are hurt

01:07:05.768 --> 01:07:12.428
and you feel happy when ego is pampered or your emotions are substantiated.

01:07:13.168 --> 01:07:17.888
But joy is something which doesn't have this double face - joy is Absolute.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:24.308
So, you start enjoying everything. For example, now see there's a beautiful carpet here,

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:28.628
I watch it without thinking

01:07:29.448 --> 01:07:34.768
and whatever the artist has put the joy in it, starts pouring on My head

01:07:35.748 --> 01:07:39.908
just like a soothing river Ganges, as they say

01:07:40.828 --> 01:07:45.288
because I don't think about it, I'm just watching it.

01:07:45.848 --> 01:07:53.088
Artist must have involved himself with great joy to do it in an abstract way but that all abstract,

01:07:53.388 --> 01:07:57.568
just reflects on Me and starts flowing down.

01:08:01.088 --> 01:08:07.768
This joy becomes then the main nourishing factor in your life.

01:08:08.548 --> 01:08:13.388
Your family life changes, husband wife's relations change,

01:08:13.948 --> 01:08:18.108
children's relations change, relation of the whole

01:08:18.348 --> 01:08:23.208
sahaja yoga brotherhood comes absolutely spontaneously.

01:08:23.888 --> 01:08:30.368
I don't have to tell you to 'Love thy neighbor' - you just love, you enjoy.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:34.028
The first time you enjoy another personality.

01:08:34.508 --> 01:08:42.048
For example now, they must have told you, we are working in fifty-five nations, it's more than that, I think, but still fifty-five

01:08:42.308 --> 01:08:45.608
is all right to make it look all right.

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:52.128
These fifty-five nations have got people of different nature,

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:57.208
different temperament, different culture, different

01:08:57.228 --> 01:09:03.068
uh.. races, different religions and when they meet

01:09:04.148 --> 01:09:11.108
they look so beautiful, they never fight, they never argue,

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:19.928
they never think of jealousies, there's no hatred of any kind,

01:09:20.368 --> 01:09:25.768
they do not value you what your skin is or what your position is

01:09:26.188 --> 01:09:31.548
everyone feels that they are part and parcel of the whole

01:09:32.148 --> 01:09:36.248
and enjoy each other. If there's a problem -

01:09:37.748 --> 01:09:43.208
first when I went to Russia first, who came there you'll be surprised

01:09:43.588 --> 01:09:47.768
were the Germans, just came rushing to help Me.

01:09:48.108 --> 01:09:52.688
I said, "How are you here?" "Mother, don't you think, is our responsibility?"

01:09:53.048 --> 01:10:00.808
Really, I was filled with joy and tears. I said look at these Germans and they became so gentle with them,

01:10:01.148 --> 01:10:08.368
so gentle with the Russians that Russians were amazed how these Germans could be so gentle!

01:10:09.008 --> 01:10:14.388
But the feeling that they had that these Russians must be brought

01:10:15.228 --> 01:10:22.288
to reality, so that they'll have better life, like we are enjoying, they should also enjoy.

01:10:24.288 --> 01:10:28.568
This joy is so great that people want to spread it.

01:10:29.988 --> 01:10:36.968
As you know that I'm a housewife, I have children, I have grandchildren and I'm very busy otherwise also

01:10:37.408 --> 01:10:44.148
but I can't help it, I have to travel for this joy because I cannot enjoy it Myself,

01:10:44.428 --> 01:10:50.868
I must enjoy it with all of you and it's very simple that you can achieve the state

01:10:51.188 --> 01:10:55.228
of your Spirit because it's very important.

01:10:55.808 --> 01:11:03.288
This is for the emancipation for the whole world because all our problems come from us only, from human-beings.

01:11:03.588 --> 01:11:10.248
Once they're transformed, you'll be amazed how things work out.

01:11:10.768 --> 01:11:14.828
Also materially, I've seen, all of them are very much helped

01:11:15.308 --> 01:11:23.228
because they become so smart, so intelligent, so compassionate, so good, that somehow or the other, everything works out.

01:11:24.328 --> 01:11:29.848
I was asking them, "Is there anybody unemployed in sahaja yoga?"

01:11:30.408 --> 01:11:36.708
They said, "None." In Australia, can you imagine? But in England, which is much worse,

01:11:36.908 --> 01:11:41.528
there's nobody unemployed in sahaja yoga - everybody is doing very well.

01:11:41.828 --> 01:11:47.308
You ask them, "How are you?" "Oh Mother, we're swimming in the ocean of joy."

01:11:48.828 --> 01:11:54.348
All those complaints, all those aggressions, everything has disappeared

01:11:54.608 --> 01:12:00.008
and they have become such beautiful people like angels, absolutely like angels

01:12:00.288 --> 01:12:07.928
and you all are capable of becoming that. You all have those powers, just you have to get them

01:12:10.708 --> 01:12:16.368
and you have to desire, you have to desire and that's how it is going to work out.

01:12:18.528 --> 01:12:26.008
It is such a big subject and I must have given at least four to five thousand lectures, in only in English language

01:12:26.288 --> 01:12:30.688
and many in other languages. So you can imagine that

01:12:30.988 --> 01:12:37.868
this subject cannot be covered in one or two days but I'm sorry I cannot uh.. spend more time

01:12:38.908 --> 01:12:44.888
in Melbourne or in Australia also. That's My life is but whatever it is,

01:12:45.188 --> 01:12:48.328
what you have to get is your Self-realization.

01:12:48.888 --> 01:12:53.588
After getting the Self-realization, though the Kundalini has

01:12:54.488 --> 01:13:02.428
got out of your fontanel bone area, has touched the mains, everything is there, but still there's [UNCLEAR - I MEAN?] a very

01:13:03.608 --> 01:13:09.128
small part of Kundalini is, few threads of Kundalini have done that

01:13:09.508 --> 01:13:14.728
and also there are problems with your physical side or mental side, emotional side - whatever it is -

01:13:14.988 --> 01:13:19.848
so it has to go back to correct you. It goes back to correct you again and again

01:13:20.128 --> 01:13:26.328
so you have to only learn how to make this connection perfect and whole being to be purified.

01:13:26.628 --> 01:13:32.908
Now for that you don't have to go to Himalayas or do any kind of penance, sacrifice, fasting - nothing,

01:13:33.268 --> 01:13:37.468
it's not needed at all. Only thing, you have to come to the collective.

01:13:37.808 --> 01:13:45.168
We have very simple type of collective because we don't take money or anything - you can't pay for it - it's so invaluable that you can't pay.

01:13:45.448 --> 01:13:49.768
How much will you pay? How much do we pay to Mother Earth for these beautiful flowers?

01:13:50.188 --> 01:13:54.088
You can't pay for it. So people, who are sahaja yogies,

01:13:54.348 --> 01:14:01.388
have, somehow or the other, gathered a little money and they have a little place where they're having meditation forum - it's a humble place.

01:14:01.788 --> 01:14:06.988
You should humble down and come there and join the collective.

01:14:07.368 --> 01:14:12.848
Once you join the collective, you'll be amazed that you'll be cleansed automatically.

01:14:13.228 --> 01:14:18.028
Automatically you'll be cleansed, also they'll tell you how to meditate at home.

01:14:18.408 --> 01:14:22.548
Just try and you'll be amazed that

01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:26.728
you are really glorious, you are really beautiful

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:31.088
and there is a purpose to our life. We are not born

01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:35.128
just by chance - there's a very big purpose

01:14:35.368 --> 01:14:39.668
and when you discover that you'll know your value and your identity.

01:14:42.388 --> 01:14:48.968
So, May God bless you! I'm very happy today you're all here, we should uh..

01:14:49.628 --> 01:14:53.328
now have the session for meditation by which

01:14:53.588 --> 01:14:57.308
I'm sure, you all can get your realization - I have no doubts about it.

01:15:04.228 --> 01:15:09.588
You see, I can go on talking for hours but, I think, talking is not going to help.

01:15:11.468 --> 01:15:16.528
But some people have questions, I don't mind answering the questions.

01:15:16.868 --> 01:15:22.588
But the questions should be relevant, please and should be

01:15:23.388 --> 01:15:28.188
such that you really desire to have your Self-realization

01:15:29.008 --> 01:15:36.008
because I'm not here to take anything from you, it's your own property, everything, I may just give you the key.

01:15:39.308 --> 01:15:45.168
And if you ask Me any questions - of course, I'm quite an expert now because I've be doing this for the last

01:15:45.168 --> 01:15:53.008
twenty-one years, so, I'm quite an expert but even if I answer your question, that doesn't guarantee that you'll get your realization,

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:59.688
doesn't guarantee - it's just a mental feat. So, what you have to think of is your Self-realization

01:16:00.028 --> 01:16:03.628
that you should all get it - that is to be desired.

01:16:15.068 --> 01:16:20.008
- Doesn't appear to be any questions, Shri Mataji
- Umm?
- There are no questions.

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:25.848
Are you sure? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right. They're wonderful people, really.

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:32.388
This time I'm really meeting very beautiful people in Australia, really, I must tell you.

01:16:33.308 --> 01:16:37.888
Even in Perth, there were such nice people - all of them got realization.

01:16:38.148 --> 01:16:43.748
And yesterday also you saw, how everybody got realization. But now the connection

01:16:43.928 --> 01:16:48.208
has to be established permanently. For that you have to give some time -

01:16:48.668 --> 01:16:52.808
that's the main thing, we don't give any time to ourselves.

01:16:53.808 --> 01:17:01.788
After all, we have these watches all the time to save the time but to save the time, to waste it.

01:17:03.288 --> 01:17:07.288
We have to give little time to ourselves, to our realization

01:17:07.868 --> 01:17:14.228
and morning and evening, say five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening, if you do meditation at home, is all right.

01:17:14.408 --> 01:17:21.408
Once a week they meet where you can go - they'll give you all the necessary information that you want, whatever you want

01:17:22.008 --> 01:17:29.848
and you don't have to pay anything. If they ask any money, you let Me know - they will never ask.

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:36.428
[INAUDIBLE]

01:17:37.168 --> 01:17:40.508
Wonderful!

01:17:51.488 --> 01:17:58.648
So at the very outset, I have to tell you, that I respect your freedom.

01:18:00.048 --> 01:18:06.728
Human-beings have been given freedom to choose and I cannot force on you

01:18:07.368 --> 01:18:11.768
Self-realization - no, I cannot. It cannot be done.

01:18:12.648 --> 01:18:15.968
So, you have to have that desire within you

01:18:16.288 --> 01:18:22.048
and Kundalini is the power of pure desire within you because all other desires

01:18:22.368 --> 01:18:25.368
are never satiable, in general.

01:18:26.008 --> 01:18:31.548
So you have to have desire within you  that you want to have your realization.

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:39.848
Now the first condition is, that you have to be absolutely self-confident.

01:18:40.328 --> 01:18:44.488
You shouldn't have diffidence about yourself - how can I get it,

01:18:45.328 --> 01:18:48.408
how will it work it out?

01:18:49.228 --> 01:18:54.328
We have so many ideas about ourselves and we start judging ourselves

01:18:54.568 --> 01:18:58.448
Please don't judge yourself. Your Kundalini will judge

01:18:58.628 --> 01:19:02.508
and She will tell you what is wrong with you and She will manage you.

01:19:02.788 --> 01:19:06.848
She has been waiting all these years to give you this second birth - She's your mother.

01:19:07.428 --> 01:19:13.008
She will find Her way and She'll manage everything. You don't have to

01:19:13.488 --> 01:19:18.488
trouble yourself and tell yourself that this is wrong with me, that is wrong with me.

01:19:20.028 --> 01:19:26.668
So first of all, you must have full self-confidence that we are going to get Self-realization

01:19:26.888 --> 01:19:34.268
and that we are going to grow completely into our spiritual awareness. You have please, that self-confidence in yourself.

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:40.068
Whatever you might have done, forget it at this moment. You have to be in the present and here

01:19:40.328 --> 01:19:44.168
you're perfectly all right and suitable for your ascent.

01:19:45.568 --> 01:19:49.888
The another thing is that, you don't have to think you're guilty

01:19:50.168 --> 01:19:54.288
This is also another, I think, like a fashion, everybody feels guilty.

01:19:54.628 --> 01:20:01.208
What is there to feel guilty, what wrong have you done. After all you are human-beings. If the human-beings

01:20:02.328 --> 01:20:08.088
make mistakes, what's wrong with that? You're not gods - if you've done mistakes, it's all right.

01:20:08.448 --> 01:20:15.508
Forget about it but don't feel guilty. If you feel guilty, then this center here, on the left side, catches

01:20:15.828 --> 01:20:21.388
which is a terrible center because it gives you horrible diseases like Angina,

01:20:21.588 --> 01:20:29.068
it gives you Spondylitis, also it gives you lethargic organs - so please, don't feel guilty.

01:20:29.468 --> 01:20:34.528
I don't know how this idea came into the people who were in charge of

01:20:34.828 --> 01:20:40.428
religion and God, that you all should feel guilty - is wrong.

01:20:42.008 --> 01:20:48.408
Absolutely wrong that you should suffer - this is another wrong. Christ has suffered for us -

01:20:48.888 --> 01:20:53.548
are we going to suffer more than Him? We don't have to suffer.

01:20:53.908 --> 01:21:00.648
All these ideas must be that you suffer, you fast and give us the money - must be that.

01:21:01.128 --> 01:21:08.148
I just can't understand, why to tell somebody to suffer - because God Almighty is your Father.

01:21:09.428 --> 01:21:13.148
and He is the essence of fatherhood.

01:21:14.548 --> 01:21:22.028
He's the greatest father you could think of and how can any loving father want his children to suffer?

01:21:22.828 --> 01:21:26.008
Logically you must understand this -

01:21:26.788 --> 01:21:31.788
why should you suffer? He's created all this beautiful world for you

01:21:32.428 --> 01:21:36.848
You should not suffer at all - so the idea of suffering should go away.

01:21:37.068 --> 01:21:42.628
It's becoming too much these days, the way people are taking to sufferings, for nothing at all.

01:21:44.888 --> 01:21:51.588
There are so many such principles, uh.. which are being sold in the market, that you have to suffer.

01:21:51.768 --> 01:21:56.648
And there was one in England which came to say, that you must go to Gobi desert.

01:21:57.408 --> 01:22:04.408
And now, Gobi desert if you go, you'll get Nirvana according to them. Of course you'll die, that's the Nirvana you'll get, no doubt.

01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:08.868
The simple thing is to go to Gobi desert without any water -

01:22:09.008 --> 01:22:16.008
within say, five, six minutes, you will die - there's nothing will be left out of you, so there's nothing to uh..

01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:21.288
suffer but it's a straight forward march to your death, that's all.

01:22:21.848 --> 01:22:28.528
So all these nonsensical ideas are to be given up. Nobody has to suffer,

01:22:28.948 --> 01:22:36.508
nobody has to think that they have to fast - of course, if you want to fast for your health, [UNCLEAR] that's different - but not for God.

01:22:38.408 --> 01:22:43.228
Is something uh... so absurd

01:22:45.408 --> 01:22:53.408
and ridiculous to make someone suffer, to tell somebody that you're a sinner - is all absurdly very cruel also,

01:22:53.908 --> 01:22:59.308
extremely cruel, while this All-Pervading power is the love of God.

01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:05.768
He loves us. This is what

01:23:06.788 --> 01:23:11.328
we should see in any person who talks of God or talks of religion.

01:23:11.548 --> 01:23:17.308
That's what they all said but the religions have gone, you know where they have gone to

01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:24.548
because they didn't seek the truth, they didn't seek the Spirit.

01:23:25.248 --> 01:23:32.208
If they had deviated, they are responsible for such a thing.

01:23:32.828 --> 01:23:37.508
They need not have done all this; They should have, really, found out what is reality.

01:23:38.248 --> 01:23:42.028
But they were very much against people who found out

01:23:42.348 --> 01:23:46.908
and tortured them, troubled them, killed them - did all kinds of things.

01:23:48.708 --> 01:23:56.428
But now, they cannot do anything because now this All-Pervading power has become dynamic.

01:23:56.968 --> 01:24:02.828
It looks after you, it protects, it worries about you - no one can touch you.

01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:08.568
Those days are gone when saints had to suffer.

01:24:12.388 --> 01:24:19.188
So just now, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

01:24:19.648 --> 01:24:26.668
not to be angry with yourself or anything. Just to be very pleasantly placed that you are a human-being

01:24:27.348 --> 01:24:35.368
and the epitome of evolution and that you have to just travel a little more to reach there.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:47.188
All right. The third condition which is also another very simple one is this

01:24:47.928 --> 01:24:50.968
that you have to forgive everyone.

01:24:52.428 --> 01:24:58.248
As I told you the other day, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - actually you don't do anything.

01:24:58.908 --> 01:25:02.988
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:25:05.508 --> 01:25:12.608
But always I've seen people say, it's very difficult to forgive. What is difficult - just to say, "I forgive everyone," - finished.

01:25:13.628 --> 01:25:20.628
In general you forgive. Don't think of those people because by thinking about them also you play into wrong hands.

01:25:21.648 --> 01:25:28.608
So just forgive all of them. Just try, it's very simple, just to say - it's a mantra you can call it.

01:25:28.988 --> 01:25:35.448
"I forgive all of them, in general," just say that and you'll feel much lighter within yourself,

01:25:35.768 --> 01:25:41.288
much better, just forgive. Why to carry this load on your head for nothing at all.

01:25:48.628 --> 01:25:55.108
I hope, you'll fulfill these three conditions which are very simple. One is the self-confidence,

01:25:55.648 --> 01:26:01.328
second is no guilt and the third one is forgiving everyone.

01:26:03.288 --> 01:26:07.688
All right, so now we are placed very pleasantly towards ourselves

01:26:08.048 --> 01:26:14.688
and we're sure we're going to get our Self-realization. We have to enter into the Kingdom of God - how can you be guilty?

01:26:18.928 --> 01:26:21.948
All right, so now

01:26:23.828 --> 01:26:31.648
there's one request is to take out your shoes because that helps you a lot to clear out your

01:26:32.928 --> 01:26:39.588
problems by the Mother Earth. She's very kind, She's the kindest thing that you can think of.

01:27:02.328 --> 01:27:08.188
Now, please put both the feet apart from each other

01:27:09.008 --> 01:27:12.008
because the left side

01:27:12.748 --> 01:27:18.528
is for your power of desire, ordinary desire.

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:25.528
Kundalini is for pure desire and the right side is for your action.

01:27:31.628 --> 01:27:36.288
Now we'll tell you in the beginning, how we're going to proceed

01:27:36.528 --> 01:27:41.308
and then you can close your eyes. I hope you're pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:27:44.188 --> 01:27:52.028
Now, please put your left hand towards Me, like this, on your lap, on your lap very comfortably. You don't have to do anything

01:27:52.348 --> 01:27:58.648
uh.. which is troublesome or painful, just like this and the right hand on your heart.

01:28:01.068 --> 01:28:05.608
Left hand on your lap and right hand on your heart.

01:28:07.008 --> 01:28:12.048
In the heart resides the Spirit

01:28:14.268 --> 01:28:20.408
and if this Spirit comes into your attention, then you have

01:28:22.048 --> 01:28:27.788
the light of the Spirit and in that light you become your own guide,

01:28:29.928 --> 01:28:36.548
you become your own master, you become your own guru. So please,

01:28:36.948 --> 01:28:44.868
now take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is the center of

01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:52.668
your mastery which is created by great masters for you.

01:28:59.048 --> 01:29:04.888
Now, please take your right hand the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

01:29:07.768 --> 01:29:15.608
This is the center for pure knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have, is not pure knowledge

01:29:15.888 --> 01:29:20.528
but this is pure knowledge because it gives you the knowledge about

01:29:20.928 --> 01:29:24.348
the laws of the Divine.

01:29:25.048 --> 01:29:29.648
It makes you capable of working it out.

01:29:30.748 --> 01:29:37.748
This is the pure knowledge you should have. Of course, we have another kind of knowledge, as you know, is black magic, this and that

01:29:38.068 --> 01:29:41.068
but this is pure knowledge of the Divine.

01:29:42.188 --> 01:29:47.368
Now, you raise your right hand, in the upper portion of the abdomen again, and push it down.

01:29:47.748 --> 01:29:52.268
This is the center again of, as I told you, of your mastery.

01:29:52.648 --> 01:29:59.028
Then you put your hand on your heart where resides the Spirit.

01:30:00.808 --> 01:30:07.368
Now you raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your face to your right.

01:30:08.328 --> 01:30:15.128
Now this is the center, I've already told you, when it is out of gear, you get diseases like Angina -

01:30:15.808 --> 01:30:21.408
so, don't feel guilty. Just now, I feel, all of you have this one the worst.

01:30:21.688 --> 01:30:25.068
What is there to feel guilty, I don't know.

01:30:26.848 --> 01:30:34.788
Please don't feel guilty. All right, now you have to take your right hand on your forehead across -

01:30:35.048 --> 01:30:40.928
you can put it this way that on one side your fingers, another side your

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:49.168
thumb and you can press it. Now, bend your head slowly forward, as far as possible.

01:30:50.808 --> 01:30:54.748
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

01:30:56.488 --> 01:31:02.748
Now, please take this right hand on the back side of your head, back side of your head, on the optic lobe

01:31:02.968 --> 01:31:06.888
and hold it tight. Now, push back your head as far as possible.

01:31:08.568 --> 01:31:15.728
Now, this is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:31:15.968 --> 01:31:22.648
just for your own satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from

01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:25.828
this All-Pervading power of love.

01:31:26.288 --> 01:31:32.788
Now, the last center is the most important. Stretch your hands, stretch your palm, push back your fingers.

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:38.948
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:31:39.228 --> 01:31:45.228
which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, put down your head as far as possible,

01:31:45.868 --> 01:31:52.208
press it hard, by pushing out your fingers only, that's important. Now, push the scalp

01:31:52.428 --> 01:31:58.628
and move it seven times clockwise, slowly, move it seven times clockwise.

01:31:59.768 --> 01:32:03.308
Please put down your head, put down your head.

01:32:12.388 --> 01:32:16.848
That's all is to be done, that's all. Now

01:32:19.348 --> 01:32:26.228
again, please take out your shoes, put your feet apart from each other, please put left hand towards Me.

01:32:27.468 --> 01:32:31.468
You can take out your spectacles, also if there's something

01:32:31.848 --> 01:32:36.668
tight on your neck or on your waist, you may take it out

01:32:39.288 --> 01:32:47.228
or say, loosen it I mean to say, if there's something, just take out the pressure, if there is any. That's all.

01:32:50.768 --> 01:32:55.248
Now, please put the left hand towards Me on your lap

01:32:55.768 --> 01:32:59.348
comfortably and the right hand on your heart.

01:33:03.408 --> 01:33:08.688
Close the eyes, please close the eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

01:33:08.928 --> 01:33:12.608
Please close the eyes, you can remove your spectacles also.

01:33:15.248 --> 01:33:22.368
Now here, you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself,

01:33:24.048 --> 01:33:30.368
three times in your heart - you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

01:33:31.128 --> 01:33:38.508
Now the question is, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

01:33:55.508 --> 01:34:00.948
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

01:34:01.688 --> 01:34:09.408
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it little hard.

01:34:10.348 --> 01:34:15.188
Here you have to ask another fundamental question in your heart,

01:34:16.188 --> 01:34:20.348
"Mother, am I my own master?"

01:34:27.448 --> 01:34:33.548
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:37.768
so I cannot force

01:34:40.548 --> 01:34:44.028
pure knowledge on you.

01:34:46.528 --> 01:34:52.608
So now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side,

01:35:03.088 --> 01:35:08.708
press it hard. Here you have to say, I mean you have to ask -

01:35:08.968 --> 01:35:16.008
because I cannot force pure knowledge on you - six times because this center has got six petals,

01:35:16.668 --> 01:35:20.328
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:35:51.848 --> 01:35:57.908
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising upward, so we have

01:35:58.168 --> 01:36:02.628
to nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence.

01:36:02.948 --> 01:36:09.648
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it and here

01:36:09.928 --> 01:36:14.928
you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

01:36:15.808 --> 01:36:23.368
"Mother, I am my own master, Mother, I am my own master,"

01:36:24.268 --> 01:36:28.088
or, "Mother, I am my own guru."

01:36:40.748 --> 01:36:47.508
The fundamental truth about you is that you're not this body, this mind,

01:36:48.008 --> 01:36:55.508
this ego, these conditionings, these emotions but you are pure Spirit.

01:36:57.468 --> 01:37:02.928
So now, raise your hand on top of your heart and here

01:37:03.208 --> 01:37:07.528
you have to say with full confidence again, twelve times,

01:37:10.808 --> 01:37:14.668
"Mother, I am pure Spirit."

01:37:15.848 --> 01:37:20.408
Twelve times, "Mother, I am pure Spirit."

01:37:34.668 --> 01:37:37.668
This All-Pervading power

01:37:40.508 --> 01:37:45.688
of love is the ocean of knowledge,

01:37:46.028 --> 01:37:51.668
is the ocean of compassion and blisses

01:37:52.308 --> 01:37:58.328
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:37:59.228 --> 01:38:04.788
and whatever you may do - mistakes as they call them

01:38:06.168 --> 01:38:13.348
can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

01:38:23.528 --> 01:38:26.568
So now, raise your right hand

01:38:28.708 --> 01:38:36.468
into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right.

01:38:40.688 --> 01:38:43.828
Here you have to say with full confidence,

01:38:45.288 --> 01:38:53.008
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it sixteen times because this has sixteen petals.

01:38:53.368 --> 01:39:01.268
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it with full confidence, sixteen times.

01:39:13.148 --> 01:39:20.428
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

01:39:21.968 --> 01:39:28.268
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and suffer,

01:39:29.128 --> 01:39:36.048
torture yourself, while the person who has tortured you or troubled you, is quite happy.

01:39:38.488 --> 01:39:46.388
So please, you have to forgive all those, in general,

01:39:47.128 --> 01:39:50.968
who have given you trouble.

01:39:52.168 --> 01:39:58.668
So now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead, put it across

01:39:58.968 --> 01:40:05.808
with fingers on one side and the thumb on the other and now, put it down your head.

01:40:06.648 --> 01:40:11.588
Press it and put it down. Here you have to say,

01:40:11.888 --> 01:40:15.988
not how many times but from your heart,

01:40:16.668 --> 01:40:21.808
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:40:23.028 --> 01:40:29.548
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." This you have to say

01:40:33.848 --> 01:40:41.848
with full confidence, with your heart, from your heart -

01:40:45.068 --> 01:40:52.388
not how many times. It's very important because this is a very constricted

01:40:52.768 --> 01:41:00.108
center and if you don't say this and you don't forgive all of them, Kundalini won't rise, so please,

01:41:01.448 --> 01:41:08.628
you have to say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:41:12.008 --> 01:41:18.688
Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head

01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:22.008
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:41:25.148 --> 01:41:33.208
Here again, you have to say it from your heart, not how many times, without counting your mistakes,

01:41:33.888 --> 01:41:38.568
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

01:41:38.888 --> 01:41:44.268
you have to say from your heart, not how many times, again I say,

01:41:48.128 --> 01:41:52.088
"Oh Divine power, if I have done

01:41:52.308 --> 01:41:56.548
anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

01:41:57.668 --> 01:42:03.428
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong

01:42:03.848 --> 01:42:07.548
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

01:42:19.128 --> 01:42:23.308
Now, stretch your hand fully

01:42:25.368 --> 01:42:32.968
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

01:42:34.668 --> 01:42:41.748
and here you have to push back your fingers and put down your head.

01:42:43.348 --> 01:42:49.468
Now again, I respect your freedom and I cannot force Self-realization on you.

01:42:50.228 --> 01:42:57.068
So, you have to move your scalp with a pressure, seven times, very slowly,

01:42:57.348 --> 01:43:02.728
saying seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization.

01:43:03.488 --> 01:43:10.148
Mother, please give me Self-realization." You have to say this seven times.

01:43:11.928 --> 01:43:15.368

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:43:39.128 --> 01:43:45.228
Now please take down your hands, please open your eyes slowly.

01:43:45.948 --> 01:43:51.488
Please put both the hands, like this, towards Me, little higher.

01:43:52.188 --> 01:43:56.408
Now watch Me without thinking.

01:44:04.108 --> 01:44:09.108
Now, put the right hand towards Me like this, and

01:44:11.528 --> 01:44:16.048
put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area.

01:44:16.228 --> 01:44:21.208
The fontanel bone area doesn't mean that you touch it but away from it

01:44:21.628 --> 01:44:29.428
just hold it, bend your head and just hold it and see for yourself if there's a cool or a warm

01:44:30.048 --> 01:44:35.468
breeze like waves are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:44:35.688 --> 01:44:41.268
You have to certify, please try to put it little away from your head.

01:44:41.468 --> 01:44:48.388
Sometimes it can be quite far away so be careful, move your hand up and down and see for yourself,

01:44:48.628 --> 01:44:52.948
if there's a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

01:44:53.548 --> 01:45:01.368
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, it can be warm - if you've not forgiven it would be quite warm - so please forgive even now.

01:45:03.088 --> 01:45:09.888
Now try with the left hand. Put down your right, head again and see with your right hand,

01:45:10.148 --> 01:45:17.908
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves coming through your fontanel bone area.

01:45:19.348 --> 01:45:27.308
Now again with the right hand, again put down your head and see for yourself

01:45:27.808 --> 01:45:33.668
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves

01:45:33.928 --> 01:45:37.468
are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:45:43.428 --> 01:45:49.168
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky, push back your head

01:45:49.488 --> 01:45:55.008
and now here you have to ask one of these following questions, one of them,

01:45:55.188 --> 01:45:59.648
three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:46:01.608 --> 01:46:09.088
or, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya,

01:46:09.508 --> 01:46:14.848
is this the Brahma Chaitanya?" Ask one of these questions three times in your heart.

01:46:24.388 --> 01:46:27.868
Now please take down your hands.

01:46:31.128 --> 01:46:34.128
You'll feel very relaxed.

01:46:36.028 --> 01:46:42.908
All those who have felt cool or warm breeze out of their fontanel bone area

01:46:43.188 --> 01:46:50.568
or on their finger-tips or on their hands, please raise both your hands, please raise both your hands.

01:46:54.168 --> 01:46:59.468
[UNCLEAR] You didn't feel it? All right, let's see.

01:46:59.748 --> 01:47:03.988
You feel it here. She's got it but she's not feeling, maybe.

01:47:05.988 --> 01:47:12.048
Practically all of you. May God bless you! I bow to you all saints, really, I bow to you.

01:47:12.488 --> 01:47:20.708
Most of you have felt it. There's only one or two exceptions. May God bless you! So beautiful it is!

01:47:23.128 --> 01:47:26.628
She's got it but it's all right, she's not feeling, it's all right.

01:47:27.088 --> 01:47:32.068
She has to feel, she has to certify - it will work out.

01:47:33.988 --> 01:47:37.248
Now, we have a follow on. I don't know...

01:47:38.888 --> 01:47:46.848
Also I would like to meet you all today, as I told you yesterday. Those who want to meet Me can come up  and I would like to meet them.
