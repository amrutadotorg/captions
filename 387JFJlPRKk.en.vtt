00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:13.822
As I've told you, it cannot be forced. I
respect your freedom. Respect your freedom.

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:19.119
It's your free will. If you want to have your
realization, only you can have, otherwise

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:27.893
you cannot. It cannot be forced on you. So
those who do not want, should leave the hall

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:37.786
to be civil to other people, otherwise 
you're welcome. There are two conditions

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:44.504
in Sahaja yoga, at least when you are
getting your realization. First is, to

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:52.265
forget your past, to forgive yourself, you
should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:00:53.901 --> 00:01:08.901
Pleasantly placed towards yourself and second
one is, that you have to forgive everyone.

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:15.893
As I told you yesterday, whether you forgive
or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:21.901
Actually, if you don't forgive, then you
play into wrong hands, so just neglect it

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:27.341
completely, don't worry about it and in
general you should say, "I forgive everyone."

00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:38.808
Just say, in general, "I forgive everyone,"
that's all. Not to count how many people

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:43.222
you have to forgive, not to know about
everyone what they have said to you but

00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:48.527
just forgive in general - that's all. So,
the first one is to forget your past,

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:54.172
that means, not to feel guilty at all - 
you're not to feel guilty. After all, you

00:01:54.172 --> 00:02:01.399
are a human being and human beings can
only commit mistakes - you're not Gods, so

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.692
what does it matter? There's nothing to
bother you on that point, should not,

00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:15.717
so please forgive yourself and forgive others
- that's very important. These are the two

00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:25.171
simple conditions but mentally you should
accept them. Now, we have to put both our

00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:29.243
feet little away from each other because
you know, there are two powers within us -

00:02:29.243 --> 00:02:37.557
left and right and we use our left hand,
symbolically, to suggest that we want our

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:42.217
Self-realization and this is the power of
desire - not of Pure Desire but desire

00:02:42.832 --> 00:02:47.572
and we use our right hand, which is the
power of action, to nourish our centers

00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:56.949
on the left hand side - we'll be nourishing
our left hand centers only. Now, please put

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:12.153
your left hand towards Me and right hand
on your heart. Now, close your eyes.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:27.840
Please don't open them till I tell you.
Here you have to ask Me a question, a very

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.846
important question - you can call Me Mother
or you can call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you like -

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:50.399
very important question. Ask a question,
three times, in your heart, not loudly please,

00:03:50.978 --> 00:03:58.338
"Mother, am I the Spirit? Mother, am I the
Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:20.651
If you are the Spirit, you are your own
guide, you are your own master. So now,

00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:26.273
please bring down your hand, right hand, in the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left

00:04:26.273 --> 00:04:32.542
hand side, press it hard and here ask
another question, three times, "Mother,

00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:40.293
am I my own master?" Ask this question
three times, "Mother, am I my own master?"

00:04:57.603 --> 00:05:09.283
Now, as I told you, I respect your freedom
and you have a free will and I cannot force

00:05:09.802 --> 00:05:16.542
Pure Knowledge on you, it cannot be - you
have to ask for it. So now, take you right

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:31.247
hand in the lower portion of your abdomen,
on the left hand side and ask Me, "Mother,

00:05:31.487 --> 00:05:39.237
please give me Pure Knowledge," six times
because this center has got six petals.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:45.131
"Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge."

00:05:55.636 --> 00:06:01.826
As soon as you ask this question,
the Kundalini starts moving upward.

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:09.633
So now, we have to nourish the upper
centers to make it's movement,

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:21.691
Her movement faster. So, please raise your
right hand, in the upper portion of your

00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:27.267
abdomen on the left hand side, press
it hard and here you say

00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:40.409
with full confidence, with full confidence
you say, "Mother, I am my own master."

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:54.885
Please say it ten times, "Mother, I am my
own master." These things remove your

00:06:54.885 --> 00:07:16.282
conditionings from wrong teachings. Now
you raise your hand to the most important

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:40.435
question, that is, you are not your body,
you are not your intelligence, you are not

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:49.203
your emotions, you are not your conditionings,
your ego, your thoughts but you are Pure Spirit.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:04.560
So raise your right hand on to your heart
and say with full confidence, twelve times

00:08:07.806 --> 00:08:17.596
full confidence please, "Mother, I am the
Spirit," just say that. "Mother, I am the

00:08:17.596 --> 00:08:19.633
Spirit," please say it twelve times.

00:08:38.797 --> 00:08:51.887
Now, raise your right hand to another very
important area within us, where by feeling

00:08:51.887 --> 00:08:59.149
guilty all the time, we have harmed a
very important center. I have to tell you

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:12.787
that the Divine Power is the ocean of
knowledge and love. It is the ocean of

00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:24.724
bliss and joy but above all, above all, it
is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever

00:09:24.724 --> 00:09:33.548
mistakes or wrongs you have done, are
dissolved by the power of forgiveness, so

00:09:33.548 --> 00:09:42.282
raise your right hand in to the corner of
your neck and your shoulder and turn your

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:51.218
head to your right. Here you have to say,
with full confidence, sixteen times,

00:09:54.307 --> 00:10:01.117
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Again you
say, "Mother I am not guilty at all."

00:10:04.724 --> 00:10:22.034
Sixteen times. I've already told you, 
whether you forgive others or not, you are

00:10:22.034 --> 00:10:33.689
not doing anything, it is a myth but if
you don't forgive others, then, you fall

00:10:33.689 --> 00:10:45.306
into the wrong hands and torture yourself for
nothing. So now, please raise your right

00:10:45.306 --> 00:10:52.186
hand on to your forehead across, press it
hard on both the sides and put down your

00:10:52.186 --> 00:11:00.550
head, as far as possible, resting on your
hand and press it on both the sides. This

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:06.157
is the center where you have to forgive.
Forgive others, forgive others.

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:28.281
Just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone." Without
thinking about them or thinking about what

00:11:28.281 --> 00:11:32.794
they have done to you, just say in
general, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:56.990
Now, how many times is not the point, from
your heart. You must say it properly.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.962
Yesterday so many didn't say and I had to
work very hard on them. So, please say it,

00:12:02.385 --> 00:12:07.825
please say it from your heart, once
for all, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:12:17.454 --> 00:12:24.064
Now, take back your hand on the backside
of your head, on the optic lobe and now

00:12:25.184 --> 00:12:45.934
raise it higher and let it rest on your
hand. Here you have to say, for your own

00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:56.350
satisfaction, not feeling guilty, not
counting your mistakes, "O Divine Power,

00:12:56.421 --> 00:13:03.751
if I have done any mistakes, please
forgive me." Say it from your heart.

00:13:14.444 --> 00:13:24.614
Now, stretch your palm, keeping your
left hand towards Me. This is the most

00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:30.522
important center - both the feet apart
from each other. Keep yourself straight

00:13:31.713 --> 00:13:39.033
and put your right hand, the center of
your palm, on top of the fontanel bone

00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:47.734
area, the soft bone which you had in your 
childhood and press it. Now, bend your

00:13:47.734 --> 00:13:56.062
head, as much as you can, press back your
fingers, press back your thumb so there's

00:13:56.062 --> 00:14:04.311
a pressure on your scalp, nicely pressurize.
Now move it, move it slowly, seven times.

00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:13.501
Here again, I cannot, I'm sorry, I cannot
disrespect your freedom and free will,

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:19.869
you have to ask for your Self-realization,
it cannot be forced on you. So seven times

00:14:19.869 --> 00:14:28.006
please say, seven times, "Mother, please give
me my Self-realization." Please say it seven times.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:34.326
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:41.511
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:14:43.277 --> 00:14:48.197
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:14:50.242 --> 00:14:56.672
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:04.805
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:11.653
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:15:13.077 --> 00:15:19.927
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:29.379
Now please, take down your both the hands
and open your eyes slowly, very slowly.

00:15:30.436 --> 00:15:41.856
Now watch Me without thinking - you can do
it. Now, put up your right hand like this

00:15:42.305 --> 00:15:48.375
and bend your head and see for yourself,
if there's a cool breeze coming out of

00:15:48.375 --> 00:15:59.778
your head. Bend your head. It is above your
head, not on, so little away from the head

00:15:59.778 --> 00:16:06.333
you try to feel, if there's a cool breeze
coming out of your head. You can take

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:14.270
your hand little further. Some people have
it quite away from the head, so see for

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:25.099
yourself there's a cool breeze coming in.
Now, put the left hand towards Me and

00:16:25.099 --> 00:16:33.808
put down your head. Now see for yourself,
again with the right hand, if there's a

00:16:33.808 --> 00:16:37.807
cool breeze coming out of your head. Some
people will get heat coming out, doesn't

00:16:37.807 --> 00:16:43.226
matter, it will later on be followed by
a cool breeze also. To see yourself, if

00:16:43.226 --> 00:16:48.350
there is a cool breeze coming, bend your
head properly - that's important. Now,

00:16:49.499 --> 00:16:54.509
again put your right hand towards Me
and bend your head. Now, don't doubt.

00:16:54.787 --> 00:16:59.837
The breeze is coming from inside and not
from the air conditioner, so see for yourself.

00:17:00.283 --> 00:17:06.013
Again, this is the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost; Is Kundalini is the Holy Ghost. Now see.

00:17:17.856 --> 00:17:27.496
Now, raise your both the hands towards the
sky, push back your head and here you ask

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:34.503
a question, "Mother, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost?" "Mother, is this the

00:17:34.503 --> 00:17:39.899
All-Pervading Power of Divine Love?"
"Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?"

00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:47.127
Ask any one of this question, three times.
Push back your head fully and ask this question.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:18:00.855
Separate your hands, don't put them together.
Separate your hands. May God bless you!

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:09.703
Bring down your hands, please. Can watch 
Me without thinking. See. Now those, who

00:18:09.703 --> 00:18:16.951
have felt the cool breeze or even a hot breeze
out of their heads or on their finger-tips,

00:18:17.184 --> 00:18:30.102
please raise both your hands. The whole of
Sydney is drowned into the ocean of joy.

00:18:30.102 --> 00:18:41.897
May God bless you! So, the Kundalini has
sprouted, Kundalini has come out, you are

00:18:41.897 --> 00:18:48.474
connected with that but you have to
establish yourself otherwise it would be

00:18:48.474 --> 00:18:53.749
like the marshy land, where
Christ has described,

00:18:53.749 --> 00:18:58.146
"Some seeds fell down, they sprouted
and were destroyed."
