1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,940
[UNCLEAR]  has really nothing to do with ultimately the process of Self-realization.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,240
It is a manifestation and it is that to tell our egos shut up.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,480
That's the end of it. We needed some physical manifestation in our central nervous system

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,720
consciously, to know that the process has started, so that,

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,580
this rational thinking, mechanic, mechanistic brain would start to quieten down - start to quieten down.

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,140
And then the process of continuing to quieten down, takes place.

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,580
And when it continues to quieten down more and more of the vibrations can be

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,320
taken in, more and more of these chakras can open,  more and more of the Kundalini can rise and

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,740
so the whole thing becomes a beautifully

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,340
expanding process of awareness and so you start to feel more of the silence.

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,240
Your thoughts don't dominate you completely as much as they used to.

12
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,500
You find that your awareness of yourself and of others changes.

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,180
You find that the illnesses that you had often miraculously get better overnight.

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,960
Others, which have been chronic in their onset, take time to be dissolved and to be neutralized.

15
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,360
But, whatever it is, it works out. So, tonight I want to start with the Mooladhara Chakra and work up

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,780
and just show you a little bit of the practicality that is involved in Sahaja Yoga.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,640
We have seven centers. They are made of five elements so combinations of those elements

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,580
and in Sahaja Yoga to deal with the blockages and to remove them so that more and more  of this experience can be felt

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,120
we have to use those elements. We have to move the energy, we have to raise the Kundalini, we have to allow

20
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,800
the energy to work it out in such a way that the whole process is one, as I said, of expansion.

21
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,020
Expansion of the space within our Spiritual being, for the first time, consciously felt in our Nervous system

22
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,240
Now, we doctors don't know very much at all about the whole process.

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:21,040
We're very limited in our understanding, in fact we absolutely blinking, quite often, to the whole process.

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,600
We tend to think of health in terms of cause and effect - mostly effect.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,280
Sometimes we get to the causes. But we never even go, very often beyond the effect.

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,960
And sometimes we can identify the cause. Actually the real cause is the blockage in the chakra.

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:45,100
If the Chakra is blocked, if there is some sort of obstacle in the nadis - these channels,

28
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,080
if there is any obstruction there, that in a way is the cause. Because if the chakra or the channel is blocked

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,700
that in turn transfers itself into the gross body, through the plexuses of  nerves

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,920
through the glands, through the circulatory system or through some combination of the neuro-physiological body

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,240
We don't understand the thing about the body beyond what we can see under a microscope or what we can

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,300
or what we can open up in surgery or what we can analyze through rational processes.

33
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,040
But that doesn't mean that we're blind completely. That doesn't mean that modern science is useless.

34
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,540
In fact, to me, in my Self-realization modern medicine is a very useful adjunct

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,120
to Self-realization. So, I'm not here to absolutely decry modern medicine

36
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,540
but I'm here to say we have to open the blinkers and see that there is something beyond the physical and the emotional and the mental.

37
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,160
And when, we see  that point then we can open ourselves to the room of the spirit and see that

38
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,480
when we become the spirit it becomes the one that rules the show.

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
It becomes the one that enlightens everything physical, mental and emotional.

40
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:08,000
If everything is controlled from the highest automatically it bathes the lower with all its vibrations.

41
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,880
and when that happens emotional health, mental health and physical health takes place.

42
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,120
But that's an improvement of our recognizable parameters within our own physical being.

43
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:29,040
But spiritually we become more integrated people - we become whole people. We become people who  become mild-mannered.

44
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,980
We start, as I told you, to become people who express the qualities - both men and women I'm talking about - of the mother.

45
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,500
We become therefore very loving -  but loving with a compassionate ring to it.

46
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,620
But compassion  doesn't always mean goody goody business. It doesn't mean social work. It doesn't mean only concepts that

47
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,800
a lot of us have about improving the lot of the world or doing thing for society.

48
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,400
Compassion means something which acts. Now, it can either act in a way which brings about your ascent

49
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:12,020
and it improves and nourishes and you start to feel the blessings of God in your awareness or it can remove

50
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,700
and throw out things which are useless. So compassion is something that acts either in

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,940
allowing you to appreciate your ascent or in removing obstacles, removing blockages

52
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:35,320
removing impediments which are in some way blocking you. Now, the all of this sounds like good theory.

53
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,980
But in practice what happens. If, for example, in the Mooladhara chakra, in this red dot

54
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:49,380
which is located very near to the anal area, very near to the Pelvic plexus,

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,980
very near to the Prostrate gland, very near to our whole aggregation of

56
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,480
physiological phenomena within the body, that chakra controls

57
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,520
not just the physical manifestation but it controls the expression of  Holiness

58
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,880
and the expression of innocence within us because there is a God in potential there.

59
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,060
And after realization that God doesn't potential anymore - that God becomes manifest.

60
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,720
Now, when those expressions of the Divine start taking place within you

61
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:35,240
automatically the badha - the blockages - start standing out sharply - in sharp relief

62
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,200
and you know exactly what's happening within you. You feel it it on your hand - here, right here - this is the place -

63
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,980
you can see on the hand on the chart. You feel it as a little pain just above the wrist of the base of the hand

64
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,440
This is the place of the Mooladhara chakra, it's the place on the heel.

65
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:01,580
You feel a burning or a stinging or a pricking or a pain or some abnormal sensation and you know the reason obstruction in that center

66
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,200
and you know without judging yourself or without feeling guilty

67
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:12,380
that in someway you have offended the quality of innocence and purity and holiness within yourself.

68
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,180
And that means that we have to be honest, we have to be sincere and yet we don't feel guilty about it we don't judge.

69
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,780
[Pardon me] we don't judge ourselves, we just get on with the job of saying okay

70
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,480
"I have been damaged, O mighty God has blessed me with the chance of Self-realization, I'm going to face it,

71
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,700
I'm going to deal with it, I'm going to clear it out because I want, as a seeker, that holiness.

72
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,280
I want to be rooted in holiness."  Rooted means Mooladhara.

73
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:54,760
Mooladhara means the support of the root. So, if the foundations are not absolutely strong

74
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,440
the whole tree will topple. Mother often says that we in the West have been so badly damaged in this chakra

75
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,960
because of our attitudes towards this chakra, because of our freedom

76
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,920
loving approach towards sex, because of the whole nature of the breakdown in righteousness in drama

77
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,220
we have damaged this chakra most. So, what have we done. Actually we've done the worst thing of all in a way.

78
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,180
We've committed a sin against the Mother. In India they do another thing. They commit a sin against the Father

79
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,700
because they don't trust that Almighty God will look after them

80
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,340
They don't trust that God, the Father, is going to take care so they get problems in this chakra.

81
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,160
But, we in the West get problems in the Mooladhara chakra, so the very root itself either has not penetrated deep

82
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,300
or, the roots themselves have been badly damaged. Now, we have to get to the knowledge of the roots.

83
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,980
and this is how in the West we have to go about repairing the damage. So, Mooladhara chakra is about our innocence,

84
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,180
it's about our holiness and we have to restore it because it's on that basis that the whole tree will grow.

85
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:15,340
It's on that basis that the whole blossoming will take place. The Kundalini will not come up strongly anywhere

86
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,620
above that chakra if the base is weak, if the base is not repaired, if the negativity is not neutralized.

87
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,220
So, we have to face us all. We have to see honestly that there is a problem but without guilt.

88
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,280
In Australia, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, this problem of guilt is extraordinarily bad -

89
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,660
it's particularly bad in Melbourne because of what we've done in the past.

90
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,820
Because we suddenly see in the light of day this is what it is all of a sudden we feel bad

91
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:55,840
And yet, quite often guilt, specially in the Catholic church and areas where  guilt is almost a mode of life

92
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,280
we use it  as a way of excusing ourselves. If we feel guilty we can keep on doing the same thing again and again - that's the philosophy.

93
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,120
And that has to stop. Neither it should be an escape, whereby, in a pouch we can tuck our,

94
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,320
our guilt, so called, as a means of not facing up to the fact that

95
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,140
okay, the time has come to face it - we don't do this again.

96
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:32,000
Or it's a way of expressing our lack of self-esteem, it's a way of expressing all sorts of

97
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,560
funny feelings that go on within us which don't allow us to ascend.

98
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:43,240
So this Mooladhara chakra, therefore, will be associated with purity and holiness in it's blossoming.

99
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:51,560
But in it's blocked condition it will be associated with all sorts of damage which relates to

100
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,660
immoral acts, licentious attitudes towards sex,

101
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,160
it relates to Tantric practices if you've been to a false guru such as Rajneesh or any of these people

102
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,680
you will be very, very badly damaged in that chakra and it will take months, if not years

103
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,080
to repair. I'm telling you this very frankly because we know from experience if this is happened.

104
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:23,060
If you use the name of God to express sex, if you use the whole process

105
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,320
of licentious attitudes as a means of ascend, so called,

106
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,900
then you are going to be quite badly damaged in that chakra. But it doesn't matter.

107
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:42,800
The Kundalini will rise and it can be repaired. So, if you apply Tantric practices, as I said, which come from Tibet, incidentally

108
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:49,500
the Lamas have brought it - it's nicely settled down in the foothills of the Himalayas and it's coming to the West

109
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:56,720
there are ashrams and it has many other ashrams all over Victoria. There are places where you can be very badly possessed

110
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,200
by spirits of the dead which directly enter into the Mooladhara chakra.

111
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,980
If anybody has ever seen an initiation by, for example the Rajneesh people, you will see precisely

112
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,100
what I mean. It is directly an example of spirit possession.

113
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,620
And the nonsense they get up to, in the name of God, is deplorable.

114
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,800
Now I'm being extremely frank with you because I've seen dozens and dozens of my patients who talk like

115
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:31,620
Bhagwan came into my aura and I love Bhagwan and how can I drop him and he's the wonderful man

116
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,040
and they're still performing these dirty things. They're doing their Kundalini meditation, getting their clothes off

117
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,120
and dancing nude until they're exhausted to rock and roll music - can you imagine?

118
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,780
It is absurd, it's [ABSANE OR OBSCENE?] and it is anti- God. Now, we have to face these things.

119
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,200
Mother apologizes for these horrible people that have come from India.

120
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:01,920
But they've come to make money out of you, they've come to use us for their own pleasures, they've come to corrupt us

121
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:10,280
because they're anti- God in their activity and Mother is anti these fake gurus and She says it openly.

122
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:18,460
She's repaired thousands of people who've damaged this chakra whether through false gurus or through our attitudes towards sex

123
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:28,220
and it's been a remarkable process. It's not only the example I gave you of one such false guru there are dozens of other

124
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,440
false pathways of psycho-sexual analysts' and so on. Doctors can quite often be false gurus.

125
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,400
Psychiatrists are the worst false gurus, quite often.

126
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,420
They go into your mind and they start playing with this left side, regressing you

127
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,320
going back over your past, re-examining stuff, ideal conditions for spirit possession.

128
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,060
Hypnosis is another one which is very damaging. You down the psyche to a point where you can put a suggestion in

129
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,020
- what you're doing is you're putting a spirit of the dead which is stronger than the one you've already got.

130
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:11,640
So, if you want to stop smoking you can go to a somebody - I used to do it, I know - you can go to somebody

131
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,720
who will help you to stop smoking and you probably will stop smoking but what you're doing is you're putting an anti

132
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:24,380
smoking spirit of the dead into the psyche which is more powerful than the one that wants to drag on a smoke all the time.

133
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,900
It is a very seditious process and be extremely careful of it, be careful of psychiatrists -

134
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,900
I'm talking about your friends now because this is an area where you have to be very, very clear.

135
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Getting back to the Mooladhara chakra - it's our innocence and it's our holiness and it's controlled by the Earth itself.

136
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,220
You're sitting on the Earth and we use the Earth as the means of sucking out this negativity.

137
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,500
If there is any indication of pain here, if we've got any of the diseases relating to that area of our body,

138
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,860
if we've got burning or heat in that area, if we have any indications of pain in the heel even

139
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:12,420
spurs on the heel, calcifications of the heels - they're all indications from the unconscious - that we have a problem in this chakra.

140
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Every part of our body now becomes enlightened. This is a representation of this chakra

141
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,880
Here is equally represented by here.

142
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,820
Here is represented by our right ankle. There are all sorts of co-relations within our body.

143
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,840
If we start feeling pains in our head all of the chakras have got their place in the head and so you start to know

144
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,620
"I'm getting a pain on this part of my head"  - this relates to

145
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,740
an expression of the Swadhishthan chakra - you've got to start to learn of all this

146
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,640
and you start to know. When you're meditating if there is any interruption to your meditation

147
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,640
you will find, "Ah! That's what it is." You put your hand there, you take the vibrations in through the left hand

148
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:05,000
and you clear it out until the heat goes or the expression of pain or wringing or burning or tingling or whatever it might be disappears.

149
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:13,200
In a very dynamic way you sort it out for yourself. It becomes absolutely clear what to do but you have to

150
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,020
learn a little bit of knowledge. A little bit you have to learn this is the Nabhi, this is the Vishudhdhi,

151
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,980
this finger, this finger relates to that chakra - that's all. You have to know left side relates to

152
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:32,920
your past, the emotions; the right side relates to your future, it relates to your pre-conscious mind. That's all, very simple stuff.

153
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,200
You have to know which way to move your hands to give a balance. If you are a very, very

154
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,500
right-sided person, which means that you're a person who lives principally in the future

155
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,580
futuristic person who's always thinking about or worrying about the future

156
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,320
then you have to raise the left side because you'll probably be emotionless, you'll be dried out

157
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,300
and you have to lower your right side to cool down and overheated condition in the body.

158
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:05,220
You probably have a liver problem, you probably have a little bit of heat in your liver - that has to be cooled down.

159
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,580
Therefore you have to know what type of food to eat if you've got a liver problem.

160
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,580
But you raise the left side you lower the right - that means you awaken the left side and you

161
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,560
cool down the right side. But if you're a very, very depressive person - not an egoistical person but a person who's very much

162
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,640
very much reflective and thinking about the past - always living in a state of left side

163
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,780
you raise the right side because you have to awaken the action part and you lower the left side.

164
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,720
It all sounds so simple that you're probably saying, "No, no, no, this is too much,

165
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,320
what is he putting on me?" But it is simple.

166
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,440
The quality of Almighty God's expression in mankind has to be simple.

167
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,640
If there was some highly complicated mechanism that we had to understand

168
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,280
or we had to go on some course - I once read a book

169
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,420
in my seeking called "A Course in Miracles." I mean it was a volume and volumes of books -

170
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,640
it's useless, if you have to do a course in it, forget it. Almighty God is going to take us to the next step

171
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,860
in Evolution in a very, very simple way. Sahaja yoga is simple. You just have to learn

172
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:24,520
how to maneuver the energy, how to clear your chakras, how to go into thoughtless awareness,

173
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,940
how to express the collective consciousness in a such a way that you can give vibrations to yourself and awaken

174
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:39,220
the vibrations in others, but not only that, but how you can let them become their own masters so that you  don't

175
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,260
become a doctor and patient relationship - that's what I do. I don't treat seekers any more as patients

176
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:53,880
I give them their realization and I say, " Okay, it's over to you," and they become sahaja yogies and they become doctors themselves and they give

177
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,640
others their Self-realization. But that's only for seekers. It, in 90% of people at this stage

178
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:09,240
people are not interested. They just want, "Fix my neck, fix my back, fix my heart, fix my headaches." That's basically what they want. So,

179
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,200
still there's room for the doctors. The doctors are not going to get broke. But, there are seekers.

180
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:23,440
There is a category of people who are looking for an answer beyond and they're the people to whom you can give realization.

181
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:31,440
They're the people who you can share your blessing with. They're the people who will become the doctors of the future

182
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:39,000
because first they fix themselves then they start giving others the blessing whereby they can fix themselves.

183
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,700
So, it is that we have to awaken the base chakra.

184
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:50,400
We have to open that center of purity which becomes the root and in which the tree is embedded because

185
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,620
if it's embedded in strong deep penetrating roots which are rich in

186
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,000
purity and holiness and innocence and wisdom

187
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:09,880
- all of these things which are qualities there - then the whole tree will be strong. So, the first thing we've got to get right

188
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,440
is the very thing which we, in Australia perhaps, have damaged most. And I say Australia

189
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:22,580
because Australia is the Mooladhara chakra of this Earth. Each major country or major area of the countries

190
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,720
has a place in this chart and Australia is at the root. Australia is this

191
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,980
spot at the bottom. India is the Kundalini itself - the 31/2 coils.

192
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:43,280
So, you got the Mother India sitting on - in Her place of holiness -

193
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,480
sitting there with that purity despite all

194
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,320
the dirt outside, despite all the poverty, despite all the apparent unclean conditions which is where

195
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,740
She's located in our physical body and beneath Her is the most

196
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,940
innocent of all Her son Shri Ganesha.

197
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,840
And Australia is that place. Australia is the Shri Ganesha of this Earth and as the Shri Ganesha of this Earth

198
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,720
we have to express that innocence that we are. And if there's one thing that

199
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,660
you will notice of a sahaja yogi, after he gets his Self-realization, he becomes a very innocent person.

200
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:31,820
He starts to take on the quality of innocence. Now, I'm not going to explain what that means to each and everyone of you

201
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:40,000
you will know. But, I believe, since realization that Australia is the most innocent place. We've got a crust of materialism,

202
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,600
Americanism, we've got a crust of all sorts of social nonsense on top,

203
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,700
we've been hurted quite often some of the worst aspects from Britain -

204
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,920
whatever it might be, underneath there is the essential innocence of Australia which is there to maintain

205
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,360
the strength of this great tree of humankind that has to grow.

206
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:07,600
Now we have got our part to play in this great Universe in the next millennia that lies ahead.

207
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,840
So we've got to get our act together without guilt and the way to do it is by purifying this chakra,

208
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:21,780
by awakening it, by letting the Mother Earth suck it out so we meditate on the earth, we use salt in the water in which we put our feet

209
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,220
when we meditate. Salt representing the Earth - so simple.

210
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Whenever we can, if we've got damage to that chakra, we work it out. We observe the diseases disappearing.

211
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:42,960
We observe them disap ..... Prostatitis, all the different diseases, the Venereal diseases and so on disappear.

212
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:50,100
All the problems relating to that area -  sciatica is one such - get better.

213
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,340
All the problems relating to our excretion, at the anal area, get better.

214
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,600
All of these things work out in a miraculous way once this chakra starts improving. And so,

215
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:09,800
that is the first one to become  enlightened because that's where the Kundalini is - she unwinds herself and she rises

216
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:16,780
to the second center which is the Swadhishtana. Now Swadhishthana is related to a plexus

217
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,220
down in this area just above the Pelvic bone but towards the spinal column at the back.

218
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,040
That plexus relates to the organs such as the uterus, the kidneys, the various other organs

219
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,840
in the lower part of the stomach and the other organs which are not part of the digestion system.

220
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,620
So, it is that, if there is  problems in these organs we have to look to the Swadhishthana chakra

221
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,140
for their correction. It's that center that gives us in the subtle body

222
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,740
our creativity. It gives us the creative power - I talked to you about that the last night I'm not going to go into it.

223
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:06,100
What I do want to say that is how we correct it. We use the two elements which are light and water

224
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,180
It is made on the left of - I beg your pardon - fire and water not light - there's a subtle difference.

225
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:20,620
On the left-hand side we use fire and on the right-hand side we use water. If it's both

226
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,860
catching - this is the finger that represents that chakra - the thumb, if you've got pain

227
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:33,480
pricking, burning in this thumb you know you've got a problem in one or the other or both of these chakras. If it's on the left we correct it with

228
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,860
fire. We use a candle, usually, and we just do a little bandhan or a circle in that way which

229
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:48,860
clears it out and you start to observe my goodness the pain is disappearing - the blockage is being removed, the whole thing is mellowing and

230
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,760
after the treatment - it might be 10 or 15 minutes - if I'm, my goodness that chakra is getting better.

231
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:02,100
On the right-hand side we use water, we put our feet in the bowl of salty water - water element [UNCLEAR] things. [Come in]

232
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,140
So, it is that we work it out with the elements. This Nabhi chakra we use the water element only.

233
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:17,920
We use the water element because the process which is most responsive

234
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:24,720
to the water element is the digestive center and the whole area within us

235
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,260
which relates to the water element that lies within us. And yet this is not some nebulous theory

236
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,500
relating to Astrology or something like this it's downright practical stuff.

237
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,700
If you've got a pain in the tummy, if you've got a gut ulcer, if you've got problems in this area, then, you will in fact

238
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:49,520
immediately start benefiting from problems, from being treated by the water element.

239
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,760
I'll give you an example. I had in my practice in Sydney

240
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,360
a nun, a Mother Superior in fact, of a [UNCLEAR -  NOVITIATE?] college of young nuns.

241
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:07,960
who used to come to me as a patient and she had a severe duodenal ulcer bleeding badly and a [UNCLEAR] in the stones and everything else.

242
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:16,280
and she was being treated and I was getting a little success with orthodox treatment but

243
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:23,420
because I felt her vibrations that she's a seeker I gave her Self-realization, I explained to her, I was very careful

244
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,120
not to say very much about Shri Mataji, because this was the just kind of be too much but

245
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:37,760
I very carefully said 'The energy of the Holy Spirit' or some such generalized term and talked about it in that way

246
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,000
and I said if you just meditate, if you put your hand on the stomach each day

247
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,700
and work on it for 20 minutes with your feet in a bowl of salt water or better still if you sit in a bath up to here using the water element

248
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm sure that this problem will disappear. She really was a seeker, she love, she had the love of God expressed in her heart,

249
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,660
she was a beaming, radiant person but she had so many worries. She was in charge of a novitiate, she had money problems

250
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:12,020
with running it, she had problems with the staff - she was a very sensitive person and so she was picking up on a lot of the rubbish of that place.

251
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,680
And she got a gut ulcer because she's a sensitive seeker. And so as a result of that sensitivity,

252
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:27,180
she was in trouble. Now, the miraculous thing that happened was that in 10 days - she came to me 2 or 3 times over the 10 day period -

253
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:34,180
I was able to observe - but more particularly she was able to observe - that the bleeding got less, the pain got less and she was

254
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:41,760
taking less and less of the medication. By 10 days she was healed. Now that was incredible

255
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,420
because there she was with living proof that she was healed.

256
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:54,760
I talked to her about Shri Mataji after 10 days, I explained to her a little more about Her and now I'm sure,

257
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:01,000
she's a very well person and in her own quiet way, probably not professing it publicly, because

258
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:08,280
let's face it, she's been an institutional framework of the church and it would be very difficult to go about talking about these things.

259
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:16,080
But she is healed and she understands where the healing has come from. These miracles happen every moment

260
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,200
not just in the physical sense but in the most wide sense.

261
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:28,680
Shri Mataji's told you about a few of the miracles and possibly She'll tell you of some of the others. Quite miraculous things happen in Sahaja yoga.

262
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,880
So, this chakra is made of the water element and we use it. We give vibrations here. We work on this chakra

263
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,920
We take out the negativity and at the same time as we're taking out the negativity

264
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:49,200
the vibrations of the Unconscious are flowing into that center to neutralize and therefore, take out

265
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:57,180
and to allow to flow in the positive vibrations which are going to enhance that spiritual space which has to

266
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,820
come and express it's own divinity. Then at the heart chakra we're made principally of the air element.

267
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,900
I say principally of the air because there's always the combination of one or others.

268
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:16,460
Actually the combination here is as you might expect, air and water. Water for circulation, water for breathing

269
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,640
as well as air. So you've got principally air element at this point. Shri Mataji is here.

270
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,900
Please be seated.

271
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,240
So, when we have heart problems, when we have breathing problems,

272
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:00,180
when we have problems relating to the lungs, to the heart, to the cardiac plexus area

273
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,900
or even to the Thymus gland, which controls the production of white blood cells, when we've got any of these things

274
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:14,480
troubling our physical body, or if we've got insecurities, if we've got problems relating to relationships

275
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,880
between say mother and daughter, father and son, husband and wife,

276
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:27,260
because this is the expression of security within us - if we treat this chakra with the vibrations

277
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,800
that are flowing through us - things get better. The insecurity disappears -

278
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:40,080
that irrational insecurity that sometimes we feel, which we can't explain, is often a catch on the center heart chakra.

279
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:48,500
If we've got a problem between ourselves and our brother or our father or our son - if in other words there's a problem on the

280
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,280
father side or the side of the male aspect - then, we will often feel it as pain in the right heart.

281
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:03,260
We may feel it in the right little finger. But more than anything we'll start to express disease processes

282
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:09,980
which cause problems. You may start to feel some blood pressure although that's not the prime cause.

283
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:17,680
You may start to feel the onset of bronchial asthma. You may start to feel all sorts of

284
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,880
pulmonary problems relating to the whole structure of either the lungs or the heart on the right side.

285
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,540
But there're very different of problems on the left side. On the left side is the side of the mother.

286
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,720
It's the side in which the spirit, itself, resides in the core of the heart.

287
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:45,480
So, if there's a problem with, within us within our relationships with our mother - if our mother is not loving,

288
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:54,100
if there is a breakdown in say us as a mother to our children - we may catch in this center.

289
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:02,260
Either way there is going to be a disturbance, the chakra is going to squeezed or twisted or even somewhat

290
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,460
detached from itself and there's going to be a problem. We might even have had a heart attack,

291
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:15,560
we might even be suffering angina. Whatever it might be things go wrong and we start to observe it.

292
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:23,840
And in sahaja yoga, by giving vibrations to those chakras, we can neutralize,  we can neutralize even the cause.

293
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,620
Because we're going beyond the cause as Shri Mataji has told you and will probably  explain again.

294
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,240
Because we doctors at best are dealing with the cause - at best. But we go beyond the cause because the Kundalini itself,

295
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:45,440
being the purest of energy, being the pure desire to be one with God, takes us beyond that. And if you use the highest energy

296
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,860
then naturally it will neutralize the distortions and abnormalities in the lower.

297
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:59,360
Then we have the Vishudhi chakra. Vishudhi  is made of the Ether - that material of the matrix of the Universe -

298
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:06,620
it's like the architecture, it's like the bones of the building upon which hang all the others.

299
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,660
And through which passes, for example, radio waves, television  pictures, newspaper,

300
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:20,940
photographs that are transmitted through the airways - it's that etheric material

301
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,860
which is in every cell, every particle of our body and which is vital to the transmission

302
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:36,240
of the prana-shakti, the Chi energy - the energy of the life force itself which helps with the sustenance of life

303
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:43,580
it's the vital force, if you like, which is not our spirit but which is the energy which gives us this physical body's

304
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:51,440
vital strength. So, this etheric material is important. But once that chakra becomes blocked,

305
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,920
once we lose that power of being the witness of the drama of life, once we don't see the point

306
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,800
that, "My God there is an All- pervading power,

307
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:08,460
there is a great God beyond which is controlling the whole show." If we lose that vision

308
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,480
then this chakra becomes ill. If you become angry, if we become guilty, if we start getting involved in the drama

309
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,900
we lose the quality of this chakra and we have to restore it - we give vibrations, we awaken

310
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:29,720
the positive qualities of that chakra, we allow it to be nurtured again. As spondylitis disappears

311
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:37,060
our thyroid gland gets better, our shoulder pain gets less, our facial tension disappears.

312
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:44,020
All the problems of the face, the skin, the nose, the eyes, the hearing, get better.

313
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:51,560
These are the blessings of the Kundalini reaching this center, awakening it, nourishing it and neutralizing

314
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,420
and bringing us back into the space which is the center, which is the Vishuddhi.

315
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:03,920
Then at the Agnya, as I said, that center is made of the light. It's made of the light element itself

316
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,920
and we use light to purify and to remove the blockages. Christ said, "I am the light."

317
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:18,360
Christ said that, "I have died for your sins," so we don't have to suffer.

318
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,160
So that, at the time of Self-realization, when the Kundalini starts nourishing this chakra,

319
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,880
you start to know what is an egoless person, you start to know, you start to watch your ego.

320
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,740
You start to say, "Hello there, Mr. Warren, you're standing up in front of the crowd,

321
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:44,220
now, are you being a bit of an egoist standing up here talking to them like this or are you getting more to the center?

322
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,440
Are you watching yourself or are you getting involved in some sort of drama which is there to blow up your own ego?"

323
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,520
And you start watching it as a third person. So you become a person who

324
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,700
starts to take on an egoless condition. You don't respond to all that is dead in you,

325
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:10,800
you don't respond to all that is past, you don't live in a sub-conscious condition in which you are constantly dragged

326
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,040
into the past where you're reflective, where you're constantly in a  sort of semi-dream state about the past.

327
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,760
So neither you suffer the pains of the past

328
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:30,100
nor do you constantly get dragged into the future with the pre-conscious mind, the Pitutary gland opens,

329
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:37,140
the two hemispheres of the brain start to become enlightened by the vibrations of the Unconscious,

330
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,780
and those two hemispheres, themselves, take on a new dimension which is enlightened awareness.

331
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:52,300
And when that happens the Kundalini can pass above that center into the next space which is the limbic area of the brain

332
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,480
which is that part which starts to feel that oneness with Almighty God.

333
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,220
It starts to feel and enjoy itself. So the real you, the Atma,

334
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:14,360
the spirit which Christ talked about, starts to enjoy itself. You start to enter into the kingdom of God in a way

335
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,120
in which you start to know the peace. You know the silence.

336
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:28,220
The love of God is not a concept anymore because you start to become love and you start to share it with others.

337
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:36,540
Sometimes you become angry with negativity and that anger dissolves the negativity too.

338
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,840
That's the compassion which is acting sometimes.

339
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,920
But the love that acts as compassion of the Mother starts to express itself at this center

340
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:55,860
because the Kundalini comes to this center, it opens, it nourishes - this chakra starts to become like a catchment

341
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:03,800
for the Unconscious. All knowledge, all power starts to flow in through this center because the Kundalini has risen

342
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,100
it's connected you and the Grace or the Brahma shakti starts flowing down doing the job.

343
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:18,100
So you start to feel a peaceful person. You become a very knowledgeable person. Shri Mataji has told me much of this

344
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:26,340
but I have never spoken in public before I came to sahaja yoga. I'd never as much as given a public lecture.

345
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:34,300
And yet, I know with confidence that what I'm saying is correct and if I say something which is incorrect

346
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:42,180
I get heat in my body or I get burning or I get some sort of prickling going inside my body, "No, no Warren, you're off, you're off center. Stop."

347
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,340
Then you correct yourself and you can speak clearly again, in the center, in the center.

348
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:55,320
It works out like that, it's self corrective. There's a homeostatic in built mechanism that brings you back to the center.

349
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,340
That's the parasympathetic which we doctors know nothing about.

350
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:07,020
So, this last chakra opens, it gets nourished all the

351
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,040
qualities within you start taking up their place in the head because they're all resident there.

352
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:21,420
This chakra is here - yes - then we have this the Vishudhhi takes it's place here, then we have the others taking their place in the head.

353
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:29,760
And you start to feel the awareness of Almighty God's greatness within your own

354
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,660
being. You start to feel a realized soul. You start to feel that confidence, you feel that love,

355
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,340
you feel that desire to share it with others. And it works out in that way.

356
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,240
So we use the elements. We don't put attention to the negativity, we put attention to opening the space of

357
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:56,900
spiritual awareness. We give ourselves a balance.

358
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,080
We work it out so that all the nadis get purified.

359
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,780
And you start to allow the Brahmashakti, you allow the Grace to flow, flow. and so you become like an instrument,

360
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,420
everyday a better instrument, so that everything around you gets purified.

361
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,780
You get purified and everything around you gets purified. You transform your families, you work situations.

362
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:27,580
And it really does work out that way and you become an extraordinarily beautiful personality

363
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,000
in which you really feel the quality of sainthood. Yeah, that's not an ego trip to say it.

364
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:39,260
You feel the quality of sainthood, you want to share that saintliness with others

365
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,280
because saintliness is not something which is a mental concept. Saintliness is a state of being.

366
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,460
Either you are a connected being to God or you're not. Now, if you are connected to God

367
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,620
jolly well you have to become a saint and you have to face that point without any false modesty.

368
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
You have to give realization to others, you have to make them doctors.

369
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:11,980
It's a tremendous work and to the people of Melbourne all I want to say is that now that Mother has blessed you

370
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,400
you have got this responsibility to take others

371
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:24,020
into that state of awareness and to bring them in to this collective evolution that has to take place

372
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:31,200
on this Universe, this great Universe, which Mother is not going to allow to be destroyed which is not going to

373
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,560
suffer any more injury, which is going to

374
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,920
bless each and everyone of the seekers and if they're not seekers now, you are going to make them the seekers.

375
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,100
I'm really happy, again, to introduce Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi to all of you.

376
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,320
[CLAPS] - Somebody lady who is tired ask her to sit down on the chair.

377
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,720
- Yes, who is that? 
- Somebody is tired, somebody who is tired

378
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,280
- Somebody who is very tired can sit there 
- can come, sit down. There's a comfortable seat for

379
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,120
- [UNCLEAR] No? That's what I'm saying. Please come and sit comfortably on the seat. 
- There's a comfortable seat for you here. Can you put it there?

380
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,660
- Come and sit. 
- Be comfortable, all right. 
-  Be comfortable in this seat.

381
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,100
- Tired means you may be suffering pain. 
- What is it? 
- She's got pain.

382
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:25,840
Pain in the body? Please help her, help her. Sahaja yogies, go and help her. Yes.

383
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,400
You can only put up with pain for so long

384
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:49,240
Yes, but it is cold from there, is it? Close the, close the thing so the breeze doesn't come in.

385
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,260
Are you comfortable now? All right.

386
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,600
Please move forward, I think.

387
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,500
Just keep a circle around this electronic equipment

388
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,760
I would say that sahaja yogies should go at the back and let the people who have come for the first time sit in front.

389
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,240
Annh... [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

390
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,540
I know you. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. All right, doesn't matter.

391
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,980
- What's that? There's a gunshot. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] 
- You're a films

392
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,840
- You're a T.V. personality now, Mother. 
- Is it?

393
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:13,120
Eh.. It's worse than that, I think, just now - It's too much. All right, doesn't matter. Please be seated. Please be seated.

394
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,200
I'm very happy that so many people have been able to come down.

395
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,240
It's really a joyous moment to see so many people from Melbourne are here

396
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,280
to establish their realization.

397
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,600
There are three types of people who

398
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,600
come to seeking.

399
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,200
The lowest type are the ones who have some sort of physical ailments

400
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,680
or some torture some diseases or who are on the verge of dying or something like that, an emergency

401
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,100
in their mind so they come to sahaja yoga.

402
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:24,480
All right, even if they come, they can be helped - that's not our top priority.

403
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:34,720
Then there are second type of sahaja yogies or we can say the people who come to sahaja yoga

404
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:41,180
are the people who are seeking other things in life

405
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,200
like jobs, money, this, that all nonsensical things.

406
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,580
But, among them there are some people

407
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,600
who want to know the cause of the problem why they are like that.

408
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,380
The third type are the people who can be divided into two

409
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,200
one the type that seeks balance, dharma, righteousness

410
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:19,520
because they find in the world people are so horrible,

411
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:25,080
so mischievous, so dangerous, so restless

412
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,280
- they get worried about all the worldly

413
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,720
turmoils that are on, they get shocked

414
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,260
and then they want to find a solution why have I come on this earth?

415
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,620
This is one type as we call bahirmukhis -

416
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:56,160
the ones, whose attention is outside but in a very subtler way, in a very Divine way.

417
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:04,360
The second ones, in the same category, are the ones who are seekers

418
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,680
who have been seeking in ages. They have been seeking in many lives

419
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:18,900
they have been seekers of truth. They have been on hills and dales - Himalayas, everywhere -

420
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:26,480
have done everything else and now born again here to be, to be able to find out the truth.

421
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,400
These are called as Antarmukhis - these are the people who are

422
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:43,140
inward. So the first priority we have to have

423
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,120
of the third category, both the types are equally important.

424
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:57,820
But after becoming realized, when you get your realization, then you achieve both the qualities simultaneously.

425
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,600
You become a yogi inside and connected with the whole world.

426
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,500
Your attention starts going outward because first the light is to be enlightened

427
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,160
and the when light is enlightened, it gives the light.

428
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:21,380
Now this Kundalini, the force within you, as is said, is pure desire.

429
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,820
It's not only pure desire but it is a purification desire.

430
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,640
It has a power to purify - tremendous power it is.

431
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,460
And this Kundalini thinks, organizes,

432
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:50,560
knows, co-ordinates, blesses and ultimately guides.

433
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,140
So to go beyond the cause

434
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,120
we must understand that this Kundalini is the pure form.

435
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,400
That means it is detached. Anything that gets attached is not pure.

436
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,560
Anything that gets spoilt is not pure.

437
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,040
What we say gold is pure because it is untarnishable -

438
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,860
untarnishable, that's the quality of gold. So it is immaculate.

439
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,500
It cannot be ruined, spoiled by anything except that

440
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:48,940
there could be khand, as they call it, could be broken in between and thus weak.

441
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,300
So now, something that has a purifying quality like a

442
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,940
purifying agent, say, take a simple thing like soap. So the soap,

443
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:10,000
wherever you apply, will clean. Kundalini wherever it will go it will clean, it will nourish.

444
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:18,680
This is one quality that we must understand that it is not tarnishable, it cannot be spoiled,

445
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,380
it cannot be ruined, moreover it cleanses, it nourishes

446
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,980
but because it thinks, it knows how to nourish you up to what point

447
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,460
how to go, how far to go or it stops.

448
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,860
But thinking is not vocal, it doesn't say anything

449
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,300
but when it goes round these chakras it makes a sound.

450
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,540
And these sounds are made because the movement

451
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,560
of Kundalini through these chakras creates

452
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,400
a non- percussion sound pass through these

453
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,560
creating sounds and these sounds are then

454
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:15,800
jotted down or heard by great saints and used in the phonetic language of Sanskrit.

455
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,140
That's why Sanskrit is supposed to be the purest language.

456
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,880
But you need not know Sanskrit now - there's no need

457
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,680
because the deities know that you don't know the Sanskrit language.

458
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:40,780
Now, this purifying fire within you or the purifying force within you or the power within you

459
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:48,460
goes and first of all enlightens our attention which is in this part

460
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,880
as you see the green part - this is the attention is.

461
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:56,080
But the movement of attention then starts moving in all directions.

462
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,500
Now when your  attention is enlightened what we call we become collectively conscious.

463
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,500
But still how do you go beyond cause and effect is the point?

464
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:14,880
Now, this Kundalini being pure no cause can be attached to it - no cause, whatsoever.

465
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,400
So, if you can enter into the Kundalini on the principle of it

466
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,420
no cause can get attached to it.

467
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,200
That's how you go beyond cause and effect.

468
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,520
But how do you enter into the Kundalini, that's the main point?

469
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:41,700
Main problem is how do we enter into the Kundalini? Supposing you are paying attention to Me and I say pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

470
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,640
Even if Kundalini rises your attention is attracted inside still you cannot pay attention inside.

471
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,920
So how do you pay attention inside is through this enlightened attention.

472
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:02,140
This attention which is enlightened has a power to take your attention inside

473
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:10,820
to the Kundalini and that's how you enter into the realm which is detached - that [UNCLEAR -LIKE?] fortress.

474
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:19,100
Nobody can enter in there. So, when you're in thoughtless awareness, when you're not thinking, you are in your fortress no body can

475
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,180
jump at you, nobody can trouble you - all the causes drop off.

476
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,840
That is why it is necessary first to practice to be in that thoughtless awareness

477
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:35,100
through the practice of sahaja yoga to begin with so that you learn how to enter into that state -

478
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:41,580
how to enter into that state. But first and foremost thing is that your Kundalini must be awakened,

479
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:47,320
then it must be allowed to move properly - you must co-operate, you must know how to do it

480
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,600
and raise it so that you keep it

481
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,700
at least if not above, at least in the brain.

482
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:04,480
But best thing is if it comes out then you have no tensions, no worries

483
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:10,860
because everything that you have passes into your attention,

484
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,880
attention touches the Kundalini because you are a realized soul

485
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:22,600
and leaves it in the force of the Kundalini, in the current of Kundalini

486
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:28,740
and this current takes away everything that is out and that's how you are cleared away.

487
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,860
This is a very, very simple way of explaining how you go beyond cause and effect.

488
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:41,460
And this is what happens but for that it is necessary that you must learn

489
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:46,980
how to enter into your Kundalini, how to keep your attention

490
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:55,280
enlightened. Now it's very easy - your attention gets involved in to anything through your thoughts.

491
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,560
Because when your consciousness entered into you -

492
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,440
- being the prismatic brain - like a prism - your attention has gone out.

493
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,620
Now, to keep this attention detached you have to make it a pure attention.

494
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,200
to begin with you must try to put attention inside

495
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,980
to be a witness, try to be a witness. But how, how will you know that you are a witness?

496
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,200
You have to be in thoughtless awareness. When you are in thoughtless awareness

497
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,900
then what happens that you're detached, you're seeing everything.

498
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,460
There're many people who talk about thoughtless awareness - you'll be surprised - I've heard some gurus -

499
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,180
they might have, I don't know because I went to America long time back

500
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,700
and they must have recorded it or whatever it is, they talk of it

501
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:52,440
but there isn't anything way of doing it. Kundalini is the only way you can go into thoughtless awareness your attention can go.

502
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:58,620
So, these people are also using words of sahaja yoga, I've seen that,

503
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,140
has no meaning because they cannot reach the Kundalini but

504
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:08,800
there makes no difference because now you have become your own guru and you find out for yourself. So, throw away all these

505
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:15,160
fake gurus away from you. The problems, the barriers, the worst of all

506
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:23,040
in sahaja yoga comes from people who have been to other gurus - it's a headache, I tell you, for you and for us.

507
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,960
First of all that you should realize that whatever you have been doing with other gurus has been all false and fake, is difficult

508
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,120
because you're so conditioned - I must tell you very frankly.

509
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,380
So, the growth doesn't take place because you have to become the guru.

510
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,940
You cannot depend on anybody as guru but you have to become the guru. I can only guide you as a Mother, I can only tell you what it is,

511
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:50,040
I can only take your Kundalini there but it is you who has to become. Like I would say, I can cook for you

512
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:54,780
but you have to eat and you have to enjoy the taste of it - I can't enjoy for you.

513
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,760
So then, you have to give up those things which you have been following which are wrong.

514
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:08,100
There may be some guru who might have been a good guru but I don't think anybody has come on the Western side.

515
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:14,280
I haven't known of anyone who has come on the Western side because I sent one fellow, he ran away in three days from New York.

516
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,740
He wouldn't settle down there, he ran up to the Himalayas and he said, " I don't want to come, Mother, don't send me anywhere."

517
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:27,740
He couldn't bear the people, he didn't have the patience [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. So,

518
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:33,660
though they did not crucify him [WISELY OR FIRSTLY?] he ran away, you see [SHRI  MATAJI LAUGHS]

519
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:40,080
He said, " Whatever you may say, Mother I cannot face these people are terrible. They are just Dollars, nothing else but moving Dollars."

520
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,320
[ALL LAUGH]

521
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:49,500
All right, so, with this kind of barrier it's very difficult to convince people.

522
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:57,400
Still they'll go on fighting, "This my guru says so, my guru..." Then you go to your guru is the best way we take it because how can we go on convincing.

523
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:03,020
You also get a headache, you see, if you take some horrible guru's name you get a headache - really, you get a catch.

524
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:09,640
You get a catch on this finger, you get a catch on this finger, you get catch everywhere, so you don't want to hear about any guru.

525
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,100
Even discussing these gurus you feel terrible - so disgusting.

526
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,100
Whether fake, horrible, money makers, you don't know when you see them you don't know whether to laugh or to cry -

527
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:26,360
- this is the situation. So, best is to find out for yourself

528
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,840
if you're willing to give up the gurus then only trouble the sahaja yogies - you see, they get fed up with it.

529
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,900
They don't want to fight that. Now, even if you want to give up they won't give you up because they have possessed you.

530
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:45,680
They're like leeches, you see, so, you still have catches of the guru. This is the worst catch that we have so far seen.

531
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:52,100
Now in the beginning of course, they had patience but now, I think, they have exhausted the patience

532
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:57,240
so, when yesterday I told them there were lots of people in Melbourne, I think, lot of people will come to sahaja yogies

533
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:03,600
But they asked Me one question, "But how many from other gurus, God alone knows," - because it's a big headache.

534
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:11,000
So, I would request you to put your guru on somewhere else and come here and see that you become the 
guru to understand that another fellow.

535
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:20,360
And then when they discover about the guru they go on saying, "That chap, that guy"

536
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:26,140
and all kinds of things they say about him but before that they'll fight for that guru.

537
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,940
So, that is one thing you must understand that don't play into the hands of these

538
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:37,700
people because, " I paid for it Mother, I paid six thousand pounds." All right, so what, must you have more of that?

539
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,980
Because they suffer, they have Epilepsies, they have all kinds of problems. We've had people of gurus who had Epilepsies.

540
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:49,100
Horrible! This is TM people having Epilepsies - I've cured so many of them, I openly say that.

541
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:55,200
Some doctor, is Dr. Frenic, he's publishing article about it - nobody listens.

542
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:01,200
There's a competition going on like a horse racing, "Oh, have you been to TM?" "No, it's expensive. All right I'll try that."

543
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,540
There's a sale on - Guru shopping sale.

544
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:09,320
So, there's a competition [UNCLEAR - SETTING OR SET IN?]. "Have you been to that sale, have you been to that sale?"

545
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,840
It's like that. So, you must know it's frivolous, it's cheapish, it's useless.

546
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:21,640
Come to the,  "Brass Tacks'," the Americans say. Come to reality

547
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:28,040
and see for yourself that these are all fake things, this is not the way you can raise the Kundalini.

548
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,620
The greatest criteria, of course, is money but another one is that

549
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,600
that whatever they tell you you can do it yourself. Why do you need a guru for that?

550
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,220
Like somebody said, " My guru gave me a name."  I mean anybody can give you a name,.

551
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,580
you can give yourself a name, whatever you want. Why do you need a guru for that?

552
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:51,520
Or, "He gave me these clothes or he gave me this mala or he made me jump or he made me take out the clothes

553
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:56,660
or somebody, you see, another fellow is eh... giving me drugs,

554
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:03,660
third person allows me to do that."  I mean, as if these gurus allow you, you think that God will allow you also?

555
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,320
"He allows us to have mass sex, so he's a very good guru because he allows us."

556
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:16,380
Why don't you go to some other places where you can do it without taking an allowance and payment to the guru?

557
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:24,160
But the guru is waiting in the Hell and you will be there soon. This is fact.

558
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,280
So, don't go after such horrible gurus who teach you all wrong things.

559
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,800
Now, what is it, is that we, as soon as we get our realization

560
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:41,340
we also realize about ourselves that, "This part of ours is lost, that part of ours is lost, this is not there,"

561
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,600
we realize and when we realize that we don't mind correcting it because we see ourselves.

562
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:52,640
We don't have to ask anybody we just see this thing within us happening. We see this part is not there,

563
01:01:52,840 --> 01:02:00,160
our attention is not all right, we cannot concentrate on anything. We understand so many things about ourselves after realization.

564
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:06,740
Now, for that, supposing Mr. X has some problem - he tries to solve his problem, he cannot

565
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,120
because he has his own problem so he comes to the collective, he comes to the whole

566
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:17,860
then what happens somebody else has got that point stronger and some other point weaker

567
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,780
as a result the strength of one person helps  another person's weakness to be cured.

568
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:30,500
And that's how there is a mutual curing system process which builds in and that's how people get

569
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:35,360
themselves all right perfected. And that is why it's a collective happening.

570
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:41,920
And when you become collective, you'll be surprised your heart opens out and you're amazed that human beings are so good,

571
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:49,180
so beautiful, they're all such beautiful creation of God. You start enjoying each other really feeling the expansion of your being -

572
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,080
that you are the other, that they are you. Such a great feeling!

573
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,740
I don't know if you can feel it at this stage or not but just to think they are all yours

574
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:05,540
and you are theirs - no problem remains between relationships, nothing. No, no problems of any kind.

575
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,660
But also no problems that would affect you remains because everybody's there to fight for you,

576
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:17,780
to work for you, to help you out. It's very surprising how it works out. Even relations

577
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:25,040
of sahaja yogies are helped so much that they're amazed how so many come forward to help.

578
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:30,460
Normally people gather only for festivals or good things but when there is difficulty nobody gathers.

579
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:36,160
And this is something great about sahaja yogies that when there is a difficulty in a sahaja yogi -

580
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,960
supposing, a sahaja yogi has a mother who's sick and she's not a sahaja yogini, they'll go and help her.

581
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:50,100
But she has to be a relation, somebody close to the sahaja yogi. The attention has to be there that a sahaja yogi

582
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:56,300
is there in trouble we must help our brother. You really become pure brothers and sisters after coming to sahaja yoga.

583
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:04,860
This is what happens very easily to you so you must be collective being. That's how you start correcting each other.

584
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:13,240
Also you develop all the knowledge, everything about sahaja yoga you understand - it's very knowledgeable.

585
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,140
Because once you know all about it you're amazed. There are people who have never spoken in the public

586
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:25,540
I find, after realization, after a month they're great speakers - suddenly you see them - can't believe it.

587
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:32,580
The other day, I was in a village travelling by a bullock-cart and the bullock-cart driver - I talked to him and I said, 'What

588
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,360
this is Nanaka or is it Kabira speaking!' Such a great saintly sayings -

589
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:43,900
I was amazed. I said, 'From where did you get it?' He said, "Mother, from you." I said, 'From Me? I'm quite amazed,

590
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,300
it's coming from where?' He said, "It's all coming from my brain only."

591
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:54,220
So, your brain gets that kind of an enlightenment - not that you become a saint you talk like a saint, you walk like a saint,

592
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:01,300
all your behavior is saintly. Nobody has to tell you - just become. The whole countenance, temperament,

593
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:09,160
the stateliness all comes to you once for all. It's beautiful! Sacrifice doesn't become a sacrifice anymore, it's joy.

594
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:14,580
Sacrifice means a joyous thing that you should be able to sacrifice. But that doesn't mean you give

595
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:19,300
all your money to your guru or something like that - never. Sacrifice doesn't mean that nonsense.

596
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,120
So, you don't give. What you give is the sacrifice of the time.

597
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:30,220
You have to sacrifice so-called time that is so important to you. Like these days people have watches.

598
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:37,760
In modern times people have watches - they must see watch, they must know about time - saving time, saving time, saving time for what?

599
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:43,660
For spending in your meditation, spending in doing God's work - it is for that.

600
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,560
People are unemployed for doing God's work - simple as that. .

601
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,280
If you get unemployed, you do God's work and you get employment as well as do God's work.

602
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:59,700
In London which is, I mean England is you know, full of unemployment but not a single sahaja yogi is unemployed

603
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,400
and he's also doing God's work. And God's work is nothing to be done much, nothing to be done much

604
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,980
but to be one with God is the point. If you're one with God -

605
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,620
[UNCLEAR - BUT?] then the work is done by God. Now what is it doing? This is doing nothing. It's just in between

606
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,640
but it is doing a work. If it is not there, you may not hear Me. So, in a way it is doing the work but it is not doing - it is a hollow thing.

607
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:28,920
That's how you become hollow personality and you start working for God - it's so enjoyable, life is so enjoyable.

608
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:34,540
Life is for you for enjoyment and not for becoming miserable or unhappy.

609
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:41,780
But you become, first of all you have to become that. Unless and until you become that all My promises are false. To become

610
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:46,320
is a desire must come from you - we cannot force you - I've told you many a times.

611
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,280
And again I request you, the desire has to pulled up. Because of your conditionings,

612
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,340
because of other lethargies that you have, because of many other books you have read

613
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:03,020
or maybe I don't know what you have done but some people are really lethargic towards their ascent, they're really very sluggish.

614
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:07,220
That's how they do not rise while some people rise very fast

615
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:13,500
and they come up very fast and they do very well. So, one has to take advantage of the time.

616
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:19,040
so that you are used for the rest of the world and that you're helpful to everyone.

617
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:26,480
Sahaja yoga is not for one person. It is for the whole society, for the whole world and for the emancipation of humanity.

618
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:34,020
This is what is already described in so many books, in scriptures but for that you are chosen,

619
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:40,280
you are the one who's doing it. So, understand your own responsibility, understand your own powers

620
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:47,620
and don't come now for, "Treat me this and Mother treat me for that. My mother's, mother's father's uncle's this thing

621
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:53,600
is sick there." Don't worry on this point. First you get all right - get all right means you meditate.

622
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,560
Now those who are sick here need not come out with their sickness at all.

623
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:02,700
They will be told how to get their sickness all right. They themselves can treat it - I don't have to treat you.

624
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,740
But once you are treated keep to certain limits. If you go beyond limits then you're caught up.

625
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:15,200
Say you are in the limit of this hall, you're sitting here and there are all negativities all around, all right.

626
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:21,880
Now, if you leave this, you catch it. So, keep your limits. not that you become a sort of a rabid

627
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:26,100
sahaja yogi - not, doesn't mean that, but keep your limits, [UNCLEAR] don't do wrong things.

628
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:32,100
As I told you, there was a fellow, who was suffering from AIDS, was cured by sahaja yoga - actually I never touched him.

629
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:39,760
But he did come to see Me, that's all - was sitting with a hands towards Me, My photograph and all that. He was completely cured but again he did the same thing.

630
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:45,520
He didn't do any work for sahaja yoga, in the sense he never came to see people, nothing of the kind - again he got it.

631
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:50,760
There are many people who got realization and then they get cancer. So they said, "Mother, how did we get cancer?"

632
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:54,720
Because you never tried to look after your self.

633
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:03,640
So, you're just the same and you're not helped nor - sometimes you can be even worse, you see, because the Divine doesn't like this.

634
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:10,800
It has spent some time on you, it has worked on you - it's not easy to raise the Kundalini of so many people with such complications.

635
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,700
It's like a mountain you have to raise - you get so tired sometimes. So, one has to understand

636
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:21,500
that somebody who respects our personality, respects our ascent, loves us so much

637
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:25,700
we should also show some interest in ourselves. So, that is the wisdom

638
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,740
one has to have and one has to work hard because you are all sages of the ancient times you're not sages today.

639
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:36,500
Only thing God of men have to become prophets and have to give

640
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:42,300
realizations to others so that they become prophets as said by William Blake.

641
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:48,040
Now, I think, today I've spoken quite a lot. I would like to have some questions from the new people

642
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:54,260
but sensible questions not aggressive questions because this place is not for aggression - is for love.

643
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:57,420
May God bless you!

644
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,980
Any questions?

645
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,340
[INAUDIBLE] 
- Yes, yes I'll pass it on to Her.

646
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,940
- Can any mentally ill person be helped? 
- Can a mentally ill person be helped?

647
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,900
Again, you will start making list of all kinds of patients of the world.

648
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:28,400
It's typical. When you come to sahaja yoga think of yourself. Do you think are you all right - you're not.

649
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:36,540
See, we're not to open a hospital - that's one thing. Of course mentally, can be all right - retarded.

650
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,480
But first you be all right. First you pay attention to yourself - that's the point I'm trying to make.

651
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:48,740
Do you see? Don't miss the point. First you get well yourself, you become equipped then you can cure a mental

652
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,640
equipped person, mentally retarded person - now how?

653
01:10:53,580 --> 01:11:00,320
Our attitude is like this, you see, that we have somebody in mind

654
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:08,300
say, somebody very close my child or someone - [UNCLEAR] so we come to sahaja yoga

655
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:16,660
So we think that, "Will the mentally be this thing, then I will get my ascent - if the child could be cured."

656
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,720
Now, the child is sick all right but you are all right. It's your life that's important.

657
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,720
First see that you get to it and then you cure your child.

658
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:33,220
But if you come in a circuitous way, Divine also finds devious ways of running away from you.

659
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,640
Take a straightforward thing - I want realization for myself.

660
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,160
How many children we have had in previous lives, how many husbands, how many wives?

661
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:46,300
Why worry about these? First of all worry about yourself, "What am I?"

662
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:54,220
But when, you'll be surprised, when you become established yourself, you become the citizen

663
01:11:54,420 --> 01:12:00,080
and your dependents are looked after by Divine, no doubt, they are looked after, they're blessed by the Divine.

664
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:04,420
Is a fact you will see yourself but first of all you enter into it.

665
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:11,760
So, don't worry about all kinds of problems and things I tell you 99% diseases can be cured, 99%

666
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:16,880
But that's not important - just now, you should be all right, you should be the light, all right.

667
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:25,740
-Yes. 
- Can I ask a personal question about myself [UNCLEAR] and I have  a

668
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:33,880
nerve pinched on the [UNCLEAR] of the skull [UNCLEAR] going down

669
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,960
the neck one to the arm and [UNCLEAR] to the hand

670
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,640
therefore is making the hand tremor. Tremors can be cured?

671
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,720
Yes, it can be. All right, done.

672
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:54,100
[LAUGHTER] It can be but you have to come here to know how to get yourself cured.

673
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:59,060
As you go to a doctor you come here and whatever they say you do it - it can be cured.

674
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:04,560
It has been cured, it will be cured so you just don't have to worry, it can be done

675
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:10,420
but it does not mean that you come for that. Your Kundalini has to be raised and then the Kundalini will do it.

676
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,640
So you come here as you go to any doctor. Now the trouble is

677
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,000
when they go to a doctor they pay so much money - I'm just telling a general, not for you but general -

678
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,980
they'll have to wait outside, for three hours they'll wait there, pay the doctor

679
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:29,240
but here, if they have to wait even for five minutes, they start shouting. See you have no right

680
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:36,200
that you should ask for the blessings but it is the Grace of God that it is going to bless you, all right.

681
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:41,980
So, come with a humble mind that you should be cured and it can be easily cured. What else?

682
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:46,980
Can anyone [UNCLEAR] ?

683
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:50,600
Can anyone be realized without knowing about Kundalini?

684
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,980
About mentally need not know much, it can be realized, of course you can be.

685
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,860
But, then you have to tell them what it is, this thing is better to do that way.

686
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,280
But there will be very few who will accept such a situation because they want to know about everything.

687
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:14,580
But they need not know all that, you can little bit say, tell them that there is a way of getting realization

688
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:20,000
and then it's like this that when you come to Me, you want to have the lights, I'll say all right,

689
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:25,020
go there's a switch you put on and you put on the switch, you get the lights without telling about it.

690
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:31,660
But you would like to know how this light is done and then that helps you to create other lights.

691
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:37,660
That's why, it is important to know about Kundalini. I would, I can do it without telling you anything

692
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,140
about Kundalini, I can raise your Kundalini but you would not know anything about and you would not know what it is

693
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,240
It has happened with many who were born realized - they did not know they were realized souls

694
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,540
and they got lost. Like I would say, greatest example, Leonardo da Vinci.

695
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,880
Leonardo da Vinci  was a realized soul  and he got lost because he didn't know he was a

696
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:04,120
realized soul, he was a higher personality than others, he got lost. So many got lost like that.

697
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:13,480
Excuse me, if your Kundalini was arisen and that happened to be lost, I mean, you have it and it happened to be lost

698
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:17,080
How can you get lost if the Kundalini has been awakened?

699
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:23,700
It is, because, you see, it is, you're not yet fully developed matured person.

700
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:31,060
When you are in an immature state it does happen. Kundalini is, when it rises, you'll be surprised, in some people it is just a wee bit,

701
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:36,320
just like a hair, just comes up a little bit because it's so difficult, you see, the passage is so blocked

702
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:43,460
so a little bit comes up. This is what it is. It is, a complete realization takes place only when you are Nirvikalpa samadhi -

703
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:48,080
- that's a higher state. So in the beginning it's just a little wee bit opens up and

704
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:56,060
one percent people do get lost, they do, because they have egos, they have superegos or all kinds of things - they do get lost - so be careful.

705
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:03,080
- Whatever is the fact. 
- Can we all become fully realized in this life?

706
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,540
I wish everybody could but how many would be there - see in Melbourne how many people there are

707
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,980
but how many come to the program and how many come here.

708
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:16,200
- In this lifetime 
- Can it be done in this life? 
- Of course can be done but

709
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,420
without their knowledge to give them realization is not possible. They have to know it

710
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:25,320
that they are in for realization, they have to ask for it  - you cannot mesmerize.

711
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,940
You have to tell them this is , I'm going to give you realization - this you have to tell them -

712
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,960
you have to take their permission, cannot just do without their permission -

713
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:39,680
But he's saying can we achieve it.  Once we get the hair's breadth can it be something that we could ...[INAUDIBLE]

714
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:46,640
Oh I see, you're saying, yes of course, of course that's what I'm saying, doesn't matter hair's breadth. In some people it is hair breadth

715
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:53,860
in some people it's quite a lot. It can, everybody can achieve it, no doubt that's what I'm saying but in the beginning sometimes it can be

716
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:58,680
very small and then people lose it. See now, yesterday

717
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:05,940
at least I think, at least two hundred people got realization, at least two hundred, out of which about hundred are here.

718
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:12,600
So you can imagine how they get lost, you see. You see they, they want some sort of a circus

719
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:16,940
some sort of a nonsense before them - they're used to that na.

720
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:24,300
They got realization - no doubt they got it - but no they didn't come. Hmm..

721
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:34,260
- Now, what is it? 
- I was at your tonight when I got realization but

722
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:39,080
when I was born on the family of my mother, I was born a clairvoyant

723
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:45,220
- Boy, what? 
- He was born a clairvoyant. He said he felt his realization the other night

724
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,220
- I [UNCLEAR] want to be a clairvoyant 
- He doesn't want to be a clairvoyant

725
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:58,140
[LAUGHTER N CLAPS]

726
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:02,460
You see, clairvoyant is also two types of things -

727
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:08,620
you see, there's one who could be a realized soul, born realized soul. He's not clairvoyant but

728
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:14,500
such a person can heal, such a person knows more than other's know, can be more creative,

729
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:21,120
may be more successful. So many things are there with a person who is a born realized as I told you - many were like that.

730
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:29,580
But, or could be the other way, that those who are born and trying to be something artificially

731
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:34,900
then these spirits come in and they make them clairvoyant. So forget it whatever has happened.

732
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:40,680
There's no need to have any clairvoyance any more. You become the owner of that power

733
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:47,080
which you know how to maneuver, what it is, how it comes, how it works, everything, so you become a knowledgeable person - an expert.

734
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:55,140
Actually I was the same, I had the same ability. As soon as Mother worked on this chakra I lost that thing

735
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:59,040
- It happened within days of [UNCLEAR] 
- It's a very

736
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:04,220
Ah.. stro..  Hmm,

737
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:12,340
If a person gets realization does he [UNCLEAR - DEPICT?] his karma and the [UNCLEAR - INCARNATION?]

738
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:20,140
Oh! Now the, when the Kundalini rises above the Agnya chakra, as I told you, it sucks your ego and superego

739
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:28,260
so by, by this it sucks in your karmas, it sucks in your kusanskaras,

740
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:35,700
it sucks in your so called sins. So there is no one. You see, for an animal there is nothing like karma.

741
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:46,220
Say a lion has to eat a cow, it eats - it has to eat.

742
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:53,620
It doesn't feel it has done some, committed some sin. Have you seen any dog feeling that he's committed some sins

743
01:19:53,820 --> 01:20:02,360
or sulking? Maybe a dog because he lives with human beings so might [LAUGHTER]

744
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:09,140
But animals do what they have to do, they don't carry on with it, they don't commit any sins - nothing.

745
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:14,600
The idea of sin has come to us, is because of our ignorance

746
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:20,360
and because people have said that if you do like this

747
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:27,560
then you are crossing your limits, you're going to adharma. That why this idea has come to us.

748
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:35,900
But that's what Kundalini is. When she touches this chakra of Mahavishnu, she sucks in all that is

749
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:45,060
there - that's the beauty of Kundalini is and you're no more, no more, with your ego or superego -

750
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:49,420
so how can you be any more sinful or the karmas are finished.

751
01:20:51,640 --> 01:21:00,200
On the contrary if you try to cleanse your karmas - you see, I've done bad karmas so I should do this and do that - you build up your ego

752
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:06,700
because ego is there. Whatever you do in the name of God, in the name of anything, what you do is to

753
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:14,500
just pamper your ego. Even if you're not

754
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:22,500
aware of it, it is there. Those people who do missionary work, you must go and see them how they live. They're extremely

755
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:28,660
hot tempered ladies, hot tempered men - I know of somebody who has got a peace prize but if you see the person heat,

756
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,280
terrible heat - all the wrinkles you can count one by one on the face.

757
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:39,780
Because you think, you see, you're conscious that it is done by me.

758
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,960
All right! Any other question? [UNCLEAR - WHAT?]

759
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:57,100
I also [UNCLEAR] your lecture on Friday night [UNCLEAR] sometime

760
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:02,720
- All right [UNCLEAR] 
- since Friday [UNCLEAR] question to my family [UNCLEAR]

761
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:08,880
I had heard a lot but it's also [UNCLEAR] and I'm worried about this [UNCLEAR]

762
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:15,620
Good, I'm glad you raised that question. She came to your program, she felt tremendous [UNCLEAR]

763
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:22,040
awareness and growth and she felt a great deal of love for her family

764
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:27,200
but she's also aware that maybe she's going to feel apart  from them

765
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:34,560
- or they perhaps apart from her. 
- No, you don't get involved into them, that's the point.

766
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,360
You're not apart, you're part and parcel but you're not involved. Say, supposing your child is sick,

767
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:45,420
take it like this, and if you're involved with the child then you cannot treat the child.

768
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:53,580
You get so upset, you see, if you have to go to the hospital that side you'll take your car the other side

769
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:58,460
because you're so upset. But when you're detached you see the whole thing very well

770
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:04,780
and you enjoy their love much more because you are in a position to see that love

771
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:10,400
otherwise you don't see love. When you're involved you don't see anything.

772
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:19,180
- Maybe we feel as though we may drift away from... 
- No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all.

773
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:25,220
on the contrary so many families have come round, so many. You see, we had some people in

774
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:33,180
England they were mostly hippies and had left their parents, this, that - they all went back to their parents -

775
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:39,960
they brought their parents to sahaja yoga also. Yes, it's not like that but

776
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:46,160
you do not take unnecessary burdens. Now supposing, somebody's father is a drunkard - we had one hippy

777
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:51,060
who got alright and then he became very good. Now he's doing very well in life, he's very good fellow

778
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:58,420
- so he went home and his father used to drink, drink, drink and he was worried this fellow is going to die after about alcoholism -

779
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:05,680
so he didn't know what to do. So he told him, "Don't drink better take to sahaja yoga, if your Kundalini is raised you will not drink."

780
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,960
"But I like it," he said. "All right." So next he went he broke all his glasses and bottles.

781
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:18,460
So when he came home he got very angry. He just kept quiet,this... just laughed. He said, " You go and get some bottle from outside."

782
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,920
Then, he was already so drunk he couldn't go out anywhere, you see,

783
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:28,300
and gradually he found that there's a kind of a protest from the family, they don't like it.

784
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:32,260
the way he's drinking - he gave up and he himself is a sahaja yogi today.

785
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:39,320
So you correct. When we're involved we don't even want to correct because we're frightened we'll lose our children, lose our love and all that.

786
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:47,540
This is no love. Love must prune a person, love must correct a person but in a way that is not so aggressive - in a simple way.

787
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:52,120
And the fellow is saved, he would have been dead  with alcoholism, he was about to die.

788
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:57,920
So the real love comes, is not indulgences by seeing the person as he is.

789
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,460
Then you enjoy all the beauties, little, little things that are done how it's bubbling with joy

790
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,560
and happiness - you see the other person better. But if you're involved

791
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:13,240
then you can be also selfish, it could be some sort of a possessiveness, can be anything

792
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:17,800
but if you're not, you see yourself and you see them - the love is much more.

793
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:22,020
There should be some distance for the love to work out, isn't it.

794
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,440
If you're involved, they are doomed and you are doomed - sort of a position is there.

795
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:33,500
So, it's very good that has happened to you - now you can love them better, much better, in a much more sensible way.

796
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:42,060
Love has to be nourishing not destroying. Mostly you find when you love your children, so called those who love,

797
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:50,020
spoil them. If you love your wife beyond certain limits she becomes a shrew, if you love your husband he becomes alcoholic - like that.

798
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:55,620
Love always, in the right sense, means correction.

799
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,800
But if not, some people say, "All right my husband likes this, doesn't matter."

800
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:04,220
Even in England some women say, "All right if he wants to have a keep let him have, I love him."

801
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,920
Can you imagine? "Because I love him let him do what he likes."

802
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:14,220
Losing all your self respect, everything,  in the name of love, is nonsense.

803
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,400
Any other question? Annh..

804
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,200
[UNCLEAR AND INAUDIBLE] one should eat to help realization

805
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:30,200
Other certain foods you should eat to help the self- realization - other certain foods.

806
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:37,600
No, no, certain foods hain ? Hun.. [LAUGHTER] I heard

807
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:45,080
[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry, I misheard - the foods.

808
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:50,180
Ah..no,  you see it is like this, I'll tell you.

809
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:57,880
It's very simple to understand that food is for our body we are not for the food.

810
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:04,040
Now some people require some type of food, some people require some type of food.

811
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:11,220
For example, a person, who requires more proteins, must eat meat, no doubt, must eat fish.

812
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:15,260
What's the use of saving all the chickens, am I going to give them realization?

813
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:23,160
[LAUGHTER]

814
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:29,140
But do you know, that in evolution when you eat the chicken, the chicken has a higher possibility.

815
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:36,880
[LAUGHTER]

816
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:42,980
So, not such facts but for some people it suits them

817
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:49,460
vegetarian food because they have eaten too much of protein, just too much of it, they have certain problems

818
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:55,760
so they should take to vegetarian for the time being till they correct - there is no fixed food for anyone.

819
01:27:56,180 --> 01:28:02,640
But for liver patients, now example, here now another fad is nobody should take sugar

820
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:09,240
now for liver patients that's the only solution - if you don't take sugar you're going to go out

821
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:16,260
absolutely very soon, so then you have to take sugar for liver who are active - those who are, whose liver is active.

822
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:21,820
It is depend on what sort of a personality you are, what sort of a food will correct.

823
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:27,540
Till you get a balanced personality you have to balance yourself out. But there's no hard and fast rule about it.

824
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:31,100
You can eat everything but you don't eat the meat of a bigger animal

825
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:39,560
because the muscles of a bigger animal are bigger than our muscular system our, annh we can say the

826
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:47,980
microscopically if you see your muscle system, your muscles are much smaller than that of, say for, a horse

827
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:55,260
but people like to eat horse, elephants, all those things - there is no need to eat all that because it is

828
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:01,260
Then, then you will have, there will be no evolution for you neither for them.

829
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:04,840
So is not to eat because that makes your muscles odd, funny

830
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:09,480
so, that's why you have to eat something that is smaller than you, is all right,

831
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:15,940
no difference but that doesn't also mean that I'm saying you must eat - may have to eat, may not have to eat.

832
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:22,180
We have a community in India which is called Jains, they, some of them have gone to such absurd limit

833
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:29,540
that in vegetarianism, if I tell you you will be shocked, that in a village they collect all the bugs,

834
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:36,420
all the bugs of the village and get a Brahmin because Brahmin is never a Jain, he's a Hindu, so they put him

835
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:42,580
in a hut, put all the bugs there - the bugs have to suck in the blood of that Brahmin

836
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:49,160
and they're rich people, Jains are, so when the bugs are all dropped out of the body then they give money to the

837
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:55,640
Brahmin so they have saved so many bugs - that's what it is, so this is absurd.

838
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:03,840
We don't go to any absurdities in sahaja yoga. We have to be extremely normal, simple, pleasant, loving people.

839
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,280
Now, yes.

840
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:15,340
Mother, you mentioned before people going to hell. I'm sorry I asked this question, it's negative,

841
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:20,660
quite don't understand the concept of Hell. Can somebody be..?

842
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:25,960
- Umm, health, Hell? 
- You mentioned in your lecture about people going to Hell

843
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:30,840
He doesn't understand this concept - how can people go to Hell - he just doesn't understand.

844
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:36,020
Oh, it is something in the house you have something for like a bathroom, isn't it?

845
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:44,160
In the same way people have to go to Hell - you must read books to understand - all the great scriptures have described it.

846
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:49,880
Mahavira has described it at length what Hell is. People have to go to Hell, they have to ,

847
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:54,540
they're so troublesome. Do you think Hitler has to enter into the Kingdom of God, should he?

848
01:30:54,760 --> 01:31:01,820
There's no sympathy for such people - God is wrathful. He sends such people to Hell, no doubt, He there is a Hell.

849
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:07,920
If you think there is no Hell then you're living in a Paradise which doesn't exist, believe Me.

850
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:14,220
There is a Hell. If you do wrong things, if you try to torture others, if you try to extract

851
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:19,980
all that what God has given to this world, then, you're to be punished and God punishes.

852
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,700
Or anybody who says there is no Hell, know that that person Himself is from Hell.

853
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:29,120
Believe Me, it is not so, I must warn you - there is Hell. there are people who say

854
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,600
nobody is bad, everybody is good, everybody could be good - it's not true, is not true.

855
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:41,560
There are so many devils already existing - what do you think of so many these fake gurus what are they?

856
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:51,980
They're all devils, they're all punished in their own ways and devils are devils, no doubt about it.

857
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,860
[UNCLEAR] eternal Hell?

858
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:01,820
Well is a concept, I mean, do you believe in eternal Hell? I wish there was one.

859
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:06,820
[LAUGHTER]

860
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:13,940
There should be one for such people they again and again come back. [LAUGHTER]

861
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:22,060
[LAUGHTER] One gets fed up with them [LAUGHTER]

862
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:26,500
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Yes?

863
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:33,580
- Does Arthritis in the Sacrum hinder the rising of the[UNCLEAR] Kundalini?

864
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:36,840
- Sorry, does.. 
- Arthritis on the..

865
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:42,280
- Sacrum 
- [UNCLEAR] Yeah 
- Does arthritis in the Sacrum hinder the rising of the Kundalini?

866
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:46,980
Should not. Arthritis is absolutely curable. Anybody who has arthritis we can cure.

867
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:53,260
The other day I saw one sahaja yogi with arthritis, why don't you cure him, it's very simple? You know how to cure arthritis, it's very simple.

868
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:59,660
It's very, very simple. Actually a person who has arthritis is a good person, normally, is a good person

869
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:06,440
has vibrations but is triggered by some sort of a possession or something or kill, chill or some neglect of the body

870
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:11,760
can be easily cured - arthritis is absolutely curable. Arthritis doesn't stop the Kundalini rising but

871
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:18,820
supposing if you had a bad accident, you are just laid down in bed, I mean you are absolutely a gone case and all that then naturally,

872
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:26,500
it is better to take another life, you see, than to make My hands pain, everybody's hands pain working on a case like that.

873
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:32,860
You must know that God has got common sense, has lots of common sense.

874
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:38,640
I mean, get common sense from Him. Like the light which is not going to give any light,

875
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:43,840
any lamp that is not going to be of any use we just don't - we put it in the junk.

876
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:50,900
So is better for such a person to take birth again but arthritis is not a disease, it's not a disease at all.

877
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:57,380
It can be cured - have you got arthritis? It can be cured, absolutely curable.

878
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:02,920
You take out your shoes, put your hands towards Me, just now, take out your shoes.

879
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:09,080
Put something for her, some sort of a warm thing. Can you put this, can you put this under her feet?

880
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:16,740
The one, no, on which you are sitting. Hmm. It is curable.

881
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:25,700
It's all right - need not take out that. Let it be, let her not take out socks.

882
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:32,620
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand out and don't write anything anymore now, just

883
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:37,660
just - the arthritis is here, where do you have arthritis?

884
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:43,600
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- In the Sacrum

885
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,140
- All right, now put your left hand towards Me 
- Lumbar, Lumbar

886
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:53,760
All right,  now you just sit down right hand like this towards the Mother Earth, no, left. Just tell her how to do it.

887
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:57,240
- Left hand towards Mother and right hand on Mother Earth. 
- Yes.

888
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:02,600
And one sahaja yogi should put your hand on her Sacrum and put the other on the Mother Earth - finished.

889
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,840
You can take it out, anybody.

890
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:12,140
Haan. That's better

891
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,380
Simple as that. Any other question?

892
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:31,620
[UNCLEAR] I cannot [UNCLEAR]

893
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:37,580
He finds he can't sleep very well, he lies there, he can't turn his brain off, he tosses and turns.

894
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:45,860
All right, there's a screw here [LAUGHTER] Just come I'll put it right. Come along

895
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:49,520
[UNCLEAR] here now.

896
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:54,000
[LAUGHTER] Actually there is

897
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:07,140
- Just sit down in front of Her. 
- What do you do? You are a.. physical work

898
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:10,660
- Yeah, I'm a shift worker. 
- Annh? 
- shift worker, used to be a weight lifter

899
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:14,660
- He used to be a weight lifter now he's a shift worker. 
- Weight lifting

900
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:20,620
[LAUGHTER] So very right sided person, all right  come forward.

901
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:26,360
- [UNCLEAR] so She can touch [UNCLEAR] 
- Put your right hand towards Me and left hand on the Mother Earth, as it is it will work out

902
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:31,880
then maybe, I'll see the screw, all right. Now, what else?

903
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:41,000
Main bahut saal se [UNCLEAR] Ma ki sirf prarthana karta rehta huun but ekagrata se nahin hoti.

904
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:45,520
Achcha ab poocho tum, Ma ko kaunsi, Durga ko maante ho?

905
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:50,800
- Nahin, main Gayatri Ma ki puja karta huun 
- Achcha to Gayatri sirf ek side hai na, saari Ma ko maana chahiye

906
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:58,180
Ma aisi baat hai aise main kisi Ma ko neglect nahin karta par ek baat hai ki hamesha do ghanta karta rehta huun

907
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:02,300
- par jitni lagan se aur jitni ekagrata se 
- Gayatri bahut zyada bhi karna theek nahin hai na

908
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:07,840
Achcha aap right hand Meri ore karo aur left hand zameen pe karke. Right hand Meri taraf karo, aise haath rakho zameen par rakho, aise

909
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:13,480
nahin aise rakho apni god mein. Aaram se god mein rakho, aaram se jisse aaaram se baith sako, aaram se.

910
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:19,600
Aur poora haath aap zameen par rakho, left hand. Achcha ab tum sawaal poocho, "Ma aap swayam sakshat Gayatri ho kya?" Aisa sawaal poocho Mujhse.

911
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:24,080
Ma Aap saakshat Gayatri, Aap sakshat  swayam Gayatri ho kya?

912
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,760
- Again, poocho teen baar 
-  Aap saakshat  swayam Gayatri ho kya?

913
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,660
- Hmm. 
-  Aap saakshat swayam Gayatri ho kya?

914
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:36,300
- Aaya? 
-Nahin Ma

915
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,980
Dekho bahut zyada tumne istemaal kiya right side.

916
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:45,780
Yahi tumhare liye mantra hai ki, "Ma Aap swayam saakshat Gayatri hain?" Woh kada zara nikaal lo ek minute haath se aur kaho

917
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,040
"Ma Aap swayam saakshat Gayatri," mann mein kaho, abhi shuru ho jayega. Mann mein kehte raho.

918
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:57,000
- Can anything be done for right hand [UNCLEAR] 
- What's it?

919
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:01,980
[LAUGHTER] It's the same one that asked the question before.

920
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:06,960
- Can anything be done to the numbness in his right hand? 
- Yes, yes right hand or left hand?

921
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:12,400
All right, come along [LAUGHTER]

922
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:18,640
Yes, sit down, sit down anywhere - anywhere you can sit down.

923
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:21,800
Now, where have you been, to which guru?

924
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:25,180
- Not a guru uhh... 
- Someone like that

925
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:31,340
[UNCLEAR] the doctors [UNCLEAR]

926
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:38,580
[LAUGHTER] That's how you got it. All right, so put left hand towards Me right hand on the Mother Earth.

927
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:42,580
Left hand towards Me right hand.. Can you put a light for him? Just arrange

928
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:49,960
You can, you can go at the back and they'll arrange it for you. All right how to sit down. Give him, give him something like that to sit down - same style. Hmm..

929
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:53,800
All right, anybody else?

930
01:38:54,700 --> 01:39:01,180
Better is now. All right, better - see, no more weight lifting.

931
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:04,780
[LAUGHTER] - Hann, aa raha hai? Aise haath rakho.

932
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,680
- Ma aaya, aaya ka matlab main nahin samjha. 
- Haath mein thandak si aayegi

933
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:13,060
- Haan. 
- Aa rahi hai? Bas theek hai. Kaam ban raha hai.

934
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:22,220
Everybody should put their hands out towards Mother.

935
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:28,380
Now, you do one thing. First of all you put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the Mother Earth.

936
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,320
Like this, flat on the earth put your right hand left hand towards Mother.

937
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:40,540
Those who are sitting at a higher level can do this way, is to put left hand towards Me and like that towards the Mother Earth.

938
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:44,660
If you're on a chair just put your right hand towards the earth.

939
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:48,620
Are you getting a cool breeze in the hand? Not yet.

940
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,320
- [UNCLEAR] 
- Little bit 
- Light, very vague, I'm not sure if it's cool

941
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:58,080
- Now, are you getting cool breeze? 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- That's it, let it work out

942
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:04,840
- On this finger 
- Yeah, [UNCLEAR] 
- All right.

943
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:09,560
- Mataji mere haath bahut bhaari lagte hain. 
- Hot aa raha hai?

944
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,040
- Hot nahin, bahut bhaari hai 
- Left hand? 
- Left hand

945
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:16,040
- Kisi guru uru ke pass gaye the kya? 
- Nahi ji

946
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:20,800
Kya karte hain ghar mein? Aap joote Meri taraf karke baithe hain, aap Hindustani hain, samajh lijiye

947
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,920
to aur kya hoga.Haan aise nahi baith sakte Ma ki taraf. Haan seedhe se baithiye

948
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:30,760
Can't sit like that, you see, haan. Ab nahi lag raha bhaari?

949
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:38,240
Dekha? Gaya bhaaripan - Ma ki taraf pair nahi karke baith sakte.

950
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,880
You can't sit with the feet towards Me.

951
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:50,420
You see, it really showed to the Indian girls because Indians know this but you don't know so it didn't show but you're not supposed to do that.

952
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:55,240
But I don't tell anybody if I tell anybody they'll say, " Oh, this lady thinks no end of Herself."

953
01:40:55,740 --> 01:41:01,900
Typical, that's a fact - theek hai na ab? Gaya bhaaripan - dekho.

954
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:09,080
When You mentioned [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE] my mother thinks that she suffers very badly, I'm trying to

955
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:15,140
- In fact I write her to come here tonight. She said [UNCLEAR] 
- All right

956
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:21,800
All right you get her here, you get her cured, arthritis is curable but first you should be all right yourself.

957
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:28,500
You see because you take over. You see, you become a doctor and you treat your mother you can be 24 hours available to her, isn't it?

958
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:33,060
It's better that you do it than anybody else does that.

959
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:38,300
- If we go to this organization last week, is it all right? I mean is it 
- Which organization?

960
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:42,800
- the spiritualist [UNCLEAR] 
- Oh, is it all right if they continue to go to the spiritualist union?

961
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:48,780
Of course not [LAUGHTER]. That's how she got it - your mother used to go there?

962
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:53,760
Ah, that's it, that's it, that's it.

963
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:00,200
I mean if you go to spirits, who are dead spirits, who enter into us through the collective sub-conscious

964
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:06,240
I mean one can end up with cancer minimum - horrible!

965
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:13,520
It's like, sitting in a boat trying to save yourself and putting your foot in the mouth of a crocodile.

966
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:19,600
[LAUGHTER]

967
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:24,180
- What if she [UNCLEAR] sake of learning? 
- Unnh?

968
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:28,820
- What if she got of the Victorians [UNCLEAR] union to the sake of learning?

969
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:34,040
- I didn't follow. 
- What if you to these spiritualists people for the sake of learning?

970
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:40,940
What do you learn, all their vidyas, bhoot vidya - What they know is - [ ASIDE - JUST PUT THAT THING THERE]

971
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:46,800
What do you learn - nothing. You learn nothing but you get all the bhoots in yourself like this.

972
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:52,200
- Umm, you learn, ah.. 
- No, no, no don't talk. [LAUGHTER]

973
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:58,020
You don't learn anything, you get into troubles like this and then it becomes a trouble for others.

974
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:04,960
- I got, I got this love in music. I got it [UNCLEAR] Victorian spiritualist 
- But, but all right you didn't get because of that

975
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:11,740
but you can get. What I said was the words you must understand that if you go to such things you get into trouble like this.

976
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,720
And now, it is going to be not very easy for us to cure, for the same reason

977
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:21,520
because if you go to spirits it's like the one, your foot is in the crocodile's mouth, you see,

978
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:28,820
and then how are we to cure you? You want you to be completely in the boat. All right, that's the point.

979
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:33,380
I didn't say, it could be earlier you might have got it, I'm not saying

980
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:39,120
because you got possessed somebody must have done it - there're so many things by which you get this. But, then,

981
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:47,280
if you have been to these people, it is difficult, we can't work, our hands don't work - see the vibrations return back, they don't act.

982
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:52,720
See the point is like that - it takes more time. Better now?

983
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,900
Theek hai chalne do. What else?

984
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:04,220
[INAUDIBLE] the whole body is very [INAUDIBLE]

985
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,860
- She's got a , she's got a problem of not been able to raise her arms. 
- Diabetic

986
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:13,880
- and she's diabetic. But this is small healing, you , you have, you

987
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:21,100
All right, now all of you who have been here for healing, that's not good. I must have somebody sensible also here, isn't it? Someone,

988
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:28,180
- To now ask some sensible questions 
- No, no, that is all right, that is curable, Diabetes is curable, you come to the center they will tell you. Now, who else?

989
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:33,620
If you achieve Self-realization in the life what becomes  of you when you die?

990
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:38,060
If you achieve Self-realization in your life what happens when you die?

991
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:43,900
Actually, we shouldn't think of the future we should be in the present but even if you ask the question the thing is then you become

992
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:49,580
empowered to decide if you want to be born again you can be born again, if you don't want you need not be.

993
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:57,440
you can take your Nirvana but mostly all those who are great people want to take birth to save the world.

994
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,980
So, you become empowered, you can decide for yourself.

995
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:11,780
- Mother, 
- Yes 
- what is the easiest way to counteract negativity of other people around you.

996
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:17,220
What's the easiest way to counteract negativity of other people around you?

997
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:24,220
You see there are many ways by which - first of all you get your realization, all right? Once you're realized try to keep in thoughtless awareness.

998
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:28,040
When you think of those people, if the thought comes to you, you should say,

999
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:31,980
"I forgive, I forgive," that's the mantra for that - one of them in the thought process.

1000
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:38,080
But otherwise it can harmful to you - you write down their names in your hands and just move your hand like this -

1001
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:44,640
once, twice and thrice - it works. They don't trouble you any more.

1002
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:48,740
So many things will work out with this - you try this principle, it's very good.

1003
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:52,900
Uh.. I mean anything - this is we call as bandhan, we call it as the protection.

1004
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:59,900
So you write anything that you want to do, just put your hands like this - it works out, it's wonderful because the power is flowing through your finger -tips

1005
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:04,940
and you can manage it, anything, like that or so there are other ways by

1006
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:09,780
you can avoid but when you'll come next they will tell you how to do it. Now is better now?

1007
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:14,640
- I'm getting uncomfortable. 
- Uncomfortable, give him a this thing

1008
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,800
- Now, much better now. 
- That's what it is - the Victoria has done

1009
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:26,580
[LAUGHTER] The Victoria Institute of Spirits - Poor Victoria queen, why to call her name, I don't know.

1010
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:34,940
- Any other question? 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- They are all right, not you - Are you better, madam?

1011
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:41,400
Have you been to anybody like that - clairvoyant or someone, annh?

1012
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:47,320
- Take a candle for her 
- [INAUDIBLE]

1013
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:51,500
- Mother, 
- Hmm 
- one question is said how do you get this Self- realization?

1014
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:54,760
- I don't think  he came to the program 
- You didn't come to the program -

1015
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:58,260
- Put your hand up. 
- through Kundalini awakening.

1016
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:02,440
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- What process is it?

1017
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:09,940
The process is living process, spontaneous process of sprouting - just like a seed sprouts, the Kundalini sprouts out.

1018
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,440
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- How do you sprout a seed?

1019
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:24,320
It just works out. Haan better, see? Better.

1020
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:32,260
Thank God you did only weight lifting, but you had gone to an Institute like that, I would never have helped you so fast. [LAUGHTER]

1021
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:38,520
All right, now put your right hand towards Me all of you.

1022
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:45,720
and left hand like this, like this at the back - put it at the back.

1023
01:47:53,160 --> 01:48:00,220
- Hmm, 
- It's flowing. 
- see the cool breeze coming in! It's there.

1024
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:06,680
See now! That's shaking before Me - that's Victoria Institution.

1025
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:14,640
- [LAUGHTER] 
- I may try 
- Haan all right, put your left hand

1026
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:20,560
- It's a possession 
- It's a possession 
- Just place it

1027
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:28,360
That has to go first and then you will be all right. Hmm, all right?

1028
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:38,240
It'll clear out, it'll clear out, just do that way. It's like just the connection

1029
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:43,940
Now, if you are a right sided person, you're just putting like this - now you're connected. So what happens

1030
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:50,120
the vibrations start flowing through here clear your right side  completely and it goes into the

1031
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:54,700
atmosphere, into the Ether - we use the Ether, the Akaasha.

1032
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:02,820
And if you want to have better results, better use also the water.

1033
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:10,460
Such people who have right sided problems should sit in the water with a little salt. Those who have left sided problems should use the light.

1034
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:15,640
They'll tell you all about it you have to come back again. All right! if you don't mind!

1035
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:22,660
Good! Now you'll sleep like a log of wood, come along, now let Me [LAUGHTER]. Come forward.

1036
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:29,900
Put your right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me. Close your eyes

1037
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:38,520
Forgive everyone. Theek hai aap. Ab Gayatri bund kariye - abhi yahan aake sahaja yoga seekho pehle phir samajh lo Gayatri kya cheez hai.

1038
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:46,060
Samyak gyan hona chahiye - must know integrated knowledge not just Gayatri somewhere something, all right! You come and know about it what is Gayatri

1039
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:54,680
what is what, everything must be known - and you just start doing something with your own ideas, is not proper - you have to know.

1040
01:49:56,060 --> 01:50:01,340
- Ma [INAUDIBLE] 
- Haan, wohi to, Brahmano ka dimaag issi se kharaab ho gaya hai.

1041
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:09,760
Pehle Brahman ho jaao, pehle Brahm ko jaano - bada one sided mamla hai [UNCLEAR - SAAB?], hai na?

1042
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:18,220
- [INAUDIBLE] Ma samajh ke maine shuru kiya 
- Theek hai bete, bas Ma samajh ke hi ho jayega - thoda sa imbalance aa gaya na.

1043
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:24,380
Samajh lena chahiye, kuch to dosh aa hi gaya hai. Uss dosh ko theek nahi karne ka kya - apne ko kya karne ka hai?

1044
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:31,400
Bhai Gayatri bhi to hamare liye hai na? Sab cheez hamare liye hai, agar humme usse labh hota hai to lena hai, nahi hota to nahi.

1045
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:38,700
Hmm, better now - relaxed? Hmm

1046
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,020
[LAUGHTER]

1047
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:51,300
Now how are you? Better, you see!

1048
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:00,300
- Sort of it 
- Yes, you are better. How are you? Is there a light on her Sacrum?

1049
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:07,100
Are you better now? Just see, stand up -

1050
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,100
All right!

1051
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,280
Aap bhi aayiye - Diabetes hai aapko?

1052
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:25,740
Yahan aayiye - ab put both the hands towards Me.

1053
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:33,960
- Aap kyaa karte hain - you know Hindi? 
- Tamil 
- Annh, Tamil - all right, sit down.

1054
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:39,680
You don't know Hindi at all? All right, sit down. So what do you do, what work do you do?

1055
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,860
- Now, I'm a housewife, now. 
- Only housewife?

1056
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:46,000
- [INAUDIBLE] teacher 
- Annh, that's why 
- Teacher

1057
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:53,360
Only a teacher can get diabetes not a housewife. [LAUGHTER] because you think too much.

1058
01:51:54,040 --> 01:52:01,760
You think too much, isn't it? Think too much, all right. Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand like this.

1059
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:09,480
Sindur nahi lagate hain - aao, kumkum lagao. Haan now, you're all right? Fine - ab theek ho tum?

1060
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,600
Aao tumhara bhi screw zara dheela ho gaya usse

1061
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:20,460
- Ma aapke saamne [UNCLEAR] 
- Bete ab uspe zyada soch vichar nahi karo, soch vichar se aur badh jaata hai yeh problem.

1062
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:25,960
Tumhara aur right sided hai. Tum ab aake yahan seekho dhyan kaise karne ka - apne ko shaant kar lo pehle.

1063
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:35,520
Baat ye Hindustani log padhte zaroorat se zyada hain aur asliyat pe nahi utarte. Yeh log badi jaldi utar jaate hain. Tum log jaante zyada ho maante kam.

1064
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,280
- Ma kuch anubhav nahi hota na 
- Abhi dekho, haath mein aa raha hai thanda?

1065
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:43,680
Ab aa raha hai na, ab to anubhav aa raha hai. Anubhav nahi bhi ho to bhi padhne ki ek hadh hoti hai.

1066
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:50,600
Kabirdasji ne kaha hai, "Padhi, padhi pandit moorakh bhaye." Hamare Marathi mein kehte hain 'Padhat moorkh'

1067
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:57,580
You see, we Indians know a lot - have no experience.

1068
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:02,740
So first of all we have to neutralize all that is known.

1069
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:10,680
Surdasji, Surdas who was a great poet, he wrote the whole of Sursagar - means the ocean of sur.

1070
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:16,000
And there afterwards he says, "O Lord, take away my avidya ," - nonknowledge.

1071
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:22,780
"Surdas ki sabhi avidya door karo Nandlal." - Haan, ab dekho, aaya kehte hi saath.

1072
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:29,920
Kabir ne diya - leo, haan dekho, hai na? Abhi aap. May God bless you!

1073
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:35,080
Theek hai.  Aap kisko, Raj Rajeswari ko maante hain?

1074
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:41,020
- Annh? 
- I don't understand Hindi. 
- Whom, whom do you uh.. Krishna, all right?

1075
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:46,020
- Now, put your hand 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Haan, just let her ask the question

1076
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:55,420
- Ask the question, 
- See your fingers 
- "Shri Mataji, are You the avtaar of Adishakti," - look at Her and say, "Shri Mataji, are You the avtaar of Adishakti?"

1077
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:58,780
- Radha Krishna, haan 
- Radha Krishna 
- ask.

1078
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
- Shri Mataji, yes 
- Getting the cool?

1079
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:06,960
- Yes, it's coming 
- Ask the question, "Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?"

1080
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:10,120
- Look at 
- Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?

1081
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:19,800
- Ask 
- Ask again 
- Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna, Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?

1082
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:25,940
Ab pehchano - itne din jiski seva ki woh agar saamne  khada jo jaaye to bhi use pehchan nahi sakte

1083
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:33,860
- Hindi, Hindi nahi 
- The One who is standing before, you must recognize

1084
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:38,920
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Haan 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Now, are you all right?

1085
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:45,260
- I'm feeling very much better now 
- Hmm 
- But did you hear what She said? The One who is standing before you, you must recognize.

1086
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:50,900
Indians have a greater capacity because they know what it is - you must understand that.

1087
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:56,040
You see I - but they understand more than you do - that's surprising.

1088
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:03,380
Not in India - India is different, of course. We have a tradition,

1089
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:07,180
we have a tradition of seeking in India.

1090
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:15,220
It's written down from childhood - everything is worked out for your seeking - you have to get your Self-realization.

1091
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:19,200
- South Africa 
- We have 
- South, South Africa 
- South Africa

1092
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:24,560
Oh, to South Africa has lost all the vibrations,  or everything of Indian - uprooted

1093
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:31,640
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Uh, so what, even in South Africa, if you are an Indian, you must carry your traditions there, you see.

1094
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:39,660
But it happens, like a mango tree if you bring it, bring it to England it will never prosper, it's like that - they get uprooted, I think.

1095
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:48,080
- Haan better, see, better? 
- Thank You. 
- Are you all right? Shakal badal gayi aapki.

1096
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:52,800
You're all right, now sleep like a log of wood. How is this gentleman? Put your hand

1097
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:59,700
- Better, not shaking so much 
- Not 
- Not 
- not so much but

1098
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:04,740
- Yes, just put your 
- sometimes it comes and goes 
- Yes, that's the spirit

1099
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:11,960
[LAUGHTER][ Send it back to that Victoria [LAUGHTER] Institute.

1100
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:19,680
Now, on the left Swadhishthana, work it on the left.

1101
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:25,780
All right, so now, I'll take your leave. May God bless you all!

1102
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,980
Please come, you have got a beautiful center here, we have got a beautiful school

1103
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:37,600
though it's only meant for 20 children, we already have got 20 children - so we can't admit your children here, agreed, but we can start another school

1104
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:43,820
if you all people help us we can start another place, you can have an ashram nearby your place, somewhere you're living

1105
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:48,860
we can manage all that but it's to be done by you and is to be arranged and organized.

1106
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:55,240
You, whatever it is now here, all of them live, they earn, they have this ashram, they run the ashram -

1107
01:56:55,540 --> 01:57:01,200
I don't know what they do with their money - I've nothing to do with it. They know all the accounts, they know among themselves, they live well,

1108
01:57:01,580 --> 01:57:07,300
they live happily, they help each other, they help others. In the same way you all are new people, you can come here

1109
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:12,800
and then we are going to start ashrams all over Melbourne as we have got in Sydney five ashrams

1110
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:17,920
and they're doing very well. So, we have to have some places but in the beginning you will have to come here, establish yourself

1111
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:22,420
and if you say you want to establish some ashram they will look into it and they'll manage. But

1112
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:27,400
those who have been in sahaja yoga for so many days they know about it - don't try to challenge them,

1113
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:33,440
don't try to be aggressive, try to listen to them. Understand that I know them and through them I'll know you.

1114
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:38,140
So, please don't try to be aggressive. There is nothing like uh..

1115
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:45,880
what you call a one sided life in sahaja yoga. So nobody is going uh.. to be

1116
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,240
one sided for you or partial to you or nothing. If they say this is wrong with you please believe them

1117
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:56,120
and just do what they're telling you because they know what is to be done in what case, how to

1118
01:57:56,360 --> 01:58:01,580
uh.. refrain from, how to indulge, how to work it out -

1119
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:05,980
they know, they have gone through it now, they have been here for four years so they know about it.

1120
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:13,060
But that doesn't mean in any way you're less, you're in no way less - some of them have just come about a month back, I find them very good

1121
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:19,720
So, it is for you to learn, to have that humility, to learn more and more and know about it

1122
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:25,260
not mentally but through your experiences, different experiences how it works out.

1123
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:28,960
- Now 
- Mother, on Friday you asked us to bring sugar and salt

1124
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:33,480
- Yes, that I'm going to say - yes, that's a good idea. So now for that sugar and salt

1125
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:40,200
we'll be sending you some sugar and salt which is vibrated and you, they'll put it in that. Now don't use your hands

1126
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:48,140
you use a spoon to stir it and use that - it is vibrated. But those people who have active life should take to sugar more

1127
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:55,460
and those who have, say this lady has  Diabetes or anything - for her sugar is not good but salt -

1128
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:01,100
so she has to take salt. So that is how it is. So, I'll come inside and vibrate it and then you can bring it here.

1129
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:08,440
All right! So abhi theek hain aap? Kaise lag raha, dard kam hai? Are you better madam, are you feeling better now?

1130
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:19,180
Good, all right, so done!

1131
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:24,860
Don't get all the sick people.

1132
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:33,320
[CLAPPING]

1133
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:41,520
- [CLAPPING] 
- [INAUDIBLE]

1134
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:53,580
Good-bye, good-bye. I'll be back again and you all can come to India also

1135
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:18,560
No, no you do it, you just see that and they will tell you what is to happen

1136
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:23,960
-  Get somebody to explain to her [UNCLEAR] left hand 
- and also tell her husband not to bother her.

1137
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:28,280
- Tell 
- Thank you! 
- her husband [UNCLEAR] Shri Mataji

1138
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:32,280
Thank you, thank you all!

1139
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,680
Excuse me, if you all could sit down for a minute

1140
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:51,780
Come everyone and try, at the center here every Tuesday, Thursday nights at 7o'clock

1141
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:56,440
On Sundays at 2P.M. we have an evening here, meditation evening

1142
02:00:56,840 --> 02:01:02,680
where the committed sahaja yogies [UNCLEAR] about sahaja yoga, you start establishing yourself.

1143
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:08,700
That's really important to come along. We've had very good response over this last three days

1144
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:15,000
with people. There must be over thousand people come to the programs. That's really [UNCLEAR] people come to-night

1145
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:20,940
That's really important that you all come and on this Tuesday normally have a special workshop evening

1146
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:27,780
[UNCLEAR] can ask you questions, we'll be talking about one of the chakras, first chakra Mooladhara chakra

1147
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:34,700
So, thanks for all coming. We have a cup of tea while at the back if you wish to stay.

1148
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:41,080
[UNCLEAR] May I suggest that when you are here in

1149
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:49,120
Victoria, to all the sahaja yogies who are here, that when you discuss the base chakra, you also explain in general the practices

1150
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:53,780
of sahaja yoga. We don't limit ourselves just to the one chakra each week.

1151
02:01:54,080 --> 02:02:00,400
We learn more about the chakra but in general we'll explain to you the sorts of things that were happening here -

1152
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:05,520
how to clear out the chakras, how to work it out so that you can get on with it but a concentration

1153
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:11,640
will be made on one particular aspect each week. But you learn all about the various methods of balancing,

1154
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:18,080
clearing out the blockages, removing possessions that have crept in over our life time, love,

1155
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:24,120
diminishing the ego whatever it is. That can be worked out in a very practical way and that's what they want to show you.

1156
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:30,520
Center will be every Tuesday and Thursday night at  70'clock and 2 P.M. on Sundays

1157
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:35,120
At the back we have some [UNCLEAR] which is a photograph of Shri Mataji

1158
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:44,220
It will explain how to meditate at home, how to clear yourself out at bedtime and also has a program [UNCLEAR]

1159
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:52,580
Could the, the sahaja yoginies please just partly [UNCLEAR] inside quickly please.

1160
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,480
Just the ladies, just move inside quickly.
