00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.760
Today we are here to

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.640
worship Christ as He was resurrected

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.960
from dead.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.680
There are lots of theories

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.640
about His death,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.590
but actually

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.880
He resurrected Himself

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.870
and then

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.760
He went down to India and settled there

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.750
with His Mother.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.800
The after-period of His Resurrection is not
described

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.590
in any books as such, but

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.910
in the,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.680
one of the Puranas,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.750
written about Shalivahana,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.560
one of the kings of dynasty I being to,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.680
has met Christ in Kashmir,

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.760
and he asked Him, ''What's Your name?''

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.870
He said, ''My name is Issa.''

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.720
And he then he asked Him also

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.840
that: ''From which country You come,
which place?''

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.720
He said: ''I come from a country

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.830
which is foreign to you and to Me,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.680
and now I'm here in My own country.''

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.790
That's how He appreciated, I think, the
Indian thing.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.920
And then He used to cure people there,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.720
and His tomb is there and His Mother's
tomb also is there.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.790
So there are other stories also

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.910
created by people who did not know much
about Him.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.760
But whatever it is, what you find,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.750
that Christ was very much impressed,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.760
and was very much there to teach about
morality

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.960
as in the Indian Scriptures, very strongly.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.800
For Him morality was the most important
thing in life,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.920
because as you know,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.760
He was the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.790
So for Him Ganesha's principle was
extremely important.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.800
And that He has expressed by saying that:

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.800
''In the Ten Commandments it is said

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.600
that 'Thou shalt not commit adultery',

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.910
but I verily say to you,

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.720
'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.'''

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.800
To such an extent

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.950
that even the eyes should not be
adulterous.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.680
it’s a very good understanding

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.600
of a personality,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:15.590
where we find in the modern times,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.640
most of them have their attention

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.680
moving up and down, with adultery.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.630
Also in one of the Upanishads I read

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.640
that even to look at a woman is adultery,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.680
even to think of a woman is adultery,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.790
and talk to women too much is also
adultery.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.920
These modern times I have seen there are
women

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.590
who are used as public relations,

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.720
everywhere, in every country.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.750
When they just go and chit-chat

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.710
and talk to people in position,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.840
and talk in such a manner

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.840
that they feel very much pampered.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.960
And one of the ways of getting favors,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.600
wrong favors, from officers,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.790
is through this kind of P.R. business,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.910
it's very common.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.680
And this is what is responsible also partly

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.600
for the corruption in many countries.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.790
Morality goes hand in hand with all kinds of
violence.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.840
Anybody who is a violent person,

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.840
a person who is in the mafia,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.960
a person who is regarded as an outcast,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.680
all of them are adulterous people of the
worst type.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.910
So one has to understand how important it
is,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.880
that morality should be our basic asset in
Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.710
Specially I would say we are so lucky
to-day,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.680
that it should be celebrated in the land of
Shri Ganesha,

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.680
that we should be here to celebrate His
Resurrection,

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.960
which actually is due to His clean,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.920
we can say absolutely Nishkalank life.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.680
Life, which was so pure.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.640
His purity was there because He was
nothing but Chaitanya,

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.710
He was nothing but vibrations.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.550
He was so pure that He could even walk
on the water,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960
He was so pure that death could not kill
Him.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.760
So we have to aim at our purification.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.800
We talk of resurrection,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.640
when we think of getting a second birth.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.800
As I have told you before, that an egg
becomes a bird,

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.680
that's called a ''dwijaha'', it's twice-born.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.830
In the same way we who are covered

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.560
with our ego and our conditionings,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.710
opens out to become a bird,

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.920
and that's how we all have come to know
about the Brahma,

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.870
about this all-pervading power which is the
Brahma.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.600
And that's how we are now really become

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.590
the Dwijahas, meaning the Brahmins.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.760
Those who have not known the Brahma,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.960
without that, what is the use of any
worship,

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.750
or any kind of chantings or anything,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.630
because you are not connected,

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.950
and if you are not connected, it has no
meaning.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.960
But we have to look at ourselves,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.830
about purity part of it.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.640
On a very low level of people, you see,

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.910
l have seen that the impurity comes

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.680
from what Christ has called as ''murmuring
souls''.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.960
These are the people who start talking

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.870
at the back of others,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.800
and just enjoy this kind of talk.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.680
This is a very low type of a personality.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.800
l think in Sahaja Yoga this should go away
completely,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.880
because it creates problems,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.640
and the main basic strength of Sahaja
Yoga

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.720
which is collectivity, is harmed by them.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.910
Specially in this respect I would request
the women,

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.960
specially the wives of the leaders

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.960
have a great responsibility.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.750
lf they start talking like that,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.750
taking interest in such talks,

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.760
then they come down to the level of others,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.710
and their motherhood is challenged.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.600
Any mother who allows the children to talk
like that

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.870
is really spoiling the entire life of that, of
children.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.680
Anybody who talks ill of anybody in Sahaja
Yoga

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.760
is really extremely dangerous for both of
them,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.880
but specially for the person who does it.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.590
So one should always avoid even thinking
ill of others,

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.760
let alone the talking of it.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.680
lf anybody talks like that,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.550
you should put your hands to your ears

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.760
and say: ''Don't tell me,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.600
l don't want to hear anything against
anyone.''

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.830
Because when we start talking against
someone,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.760
we get all the bad things that person has.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.840
Apart from that our mind is spoiled,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.760
is impurity in your mind.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.950
Then you talk to others,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.750
it increases and it becomes worse.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.560
It is the responsibility of the women,

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.830
to be very much careful, because

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.640
this kind of thing is more with the women

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.550
because they are a little excluded,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.680
they have exclusive friends,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.600
and they have exclusive life.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.550
They are different type than men are.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.760
Men if they have to get angry with
someone

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.600
or if they want to say something

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.600
they’ll just go and have a fight and finish
with it.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.760
But women will keep it in their mind

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.600
and will say something,

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.790
and it's such a bad thing to start,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.710
it's just like a worm it moves,

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.710
and is very infectious.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.590
So all of you must remember

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.750
that this is the first thing you must avoid,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.640
is to listen against anyone,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.560
talk against anyone, have small talks.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.950
l have said the same thing in Perth,

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.720
because last time when I came I found

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.630
horrible things were done against people.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.670
Now again I tell you this,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.830
because we are at a point

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.880
where we have to understand that morality

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.720
is not only about what is the sex is,

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.870
but is much more than that, much wider
than that.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.880
So because we want to have our
purification,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.680
let us have introspection within ourselves.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.880
People ask Me, ''How did You manage so
well in Russia?''

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.800
Yes, one thing about Russia is very great,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.600
that they're very introspective.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.830
lf you read any novel of a Russian writer,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.830
you’ll be surprised to see that

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.600
all of them are introspecting,

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.560
all the characters are introspective,

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.960
they want to see ''Why I do it''.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.680
For example, somebody is lazy.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.920
He doesn't work.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.790
He dedicates his time in reading or
something else

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.680
but he cannot put his physical body to any
strain.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.680
Then he introspects: ''Why, why am I so
lazy?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.600
Why can't I do something more active?''

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.790
Then somebody who is always sort of
difficult,

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.920
and angry type,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.670
that people don't like him.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.910
Then instead of getting angry with others,

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.600
he has to see himself within himself:

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.630
''Why am I not like that,

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.590
why people don't care for me,

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.880
what do I have within me

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.670
that is making me so miserable?''

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.680
So you’ll see that you are either
conditioned,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.760
or you have a funny ego which is coming
up,

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.840
and is making you do wrong things

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.710
which you should not do.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.880
That's one of the purifications

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.680
you can have of your mind

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.920
when you start introspecting yourself.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.680
Now as the culture is I find is not very
much

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.640
for the benevolence of human beings.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.960
It is, you don't know what people are up to,

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.800
what they can do, how far they can go.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.670
Nothing is possible.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.760
l have seen in this, some of the marriages
we had,

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.680
very shocking things,

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.840
that the men or women never told Me,

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.790
and they had horrible diseases.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.950
And they just put Me into trouble.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.640
There are many others who have done this
kind of thing.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.750
So first thing, you must know

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.920
that you cannot be a hypocrite in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.720
lf you are a hypocrite,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.840
if you do not sincerely believe in Sahaja
Yoga,

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.590
fully engrossed yourself,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.800
you do not purify yourself and jump into
yourself,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.830
then you will be exposed very soon,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.560
and you'll be thrown away from Sahaja
Yoga,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.840
no doubt about it.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.840
l will not throw, I will forgive,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.600
but as I have told you there are two forces

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.870
working in Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.800
one is centrifugal and another centripetal.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.840
By centripetal force you’ll be attracted,

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.950
but by centrifugal force you’ll be thrown
out.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.720
So one has to be very, very careful,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.710
because whatever you have got

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.600
is something really remarkably,

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.680
surprisingly so heavenly, and so easily.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.560
Actually I am surprised at Myself,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.920
how I have achieved all these things,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.920
but it has been achieved, because as I told
you,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.720
that the all-pervading power itself

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.910
has taken a dynamic role.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.720
It is acting

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.600
because it is now in, we are in Krita Yuga.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.760
This Krita Yuga comes when there is a gap

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.840
between, from one Yuga to another Yuga.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.590
Like we had Kali Yuga.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.640
Kali Yuga has to go to Satya Yuga,

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.840
in between there's Krita Yuga, when this
acts

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.870
and evolutionary process have taken place
at that time.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.840
So now the last evolution has started and
again,

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:12.600
this all-pervading power has become

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.720
very dynamic.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.680
That's how you get all My photographs

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.840
and you get all these things,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.840
and you are also getting people realized,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.600
you yourself, you are surprised

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.870
at the miracles you have.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.790
Everybody can tell you hundreds of
miracles.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.960
So these miracles also are worked out

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.720
by this all-pervading power.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.600
At this juncture, when we have all these
possibilities

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.670
if we try to be hypocritical we are harming
ourselves.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.710
lf we try to criticize others, and not
ourselves,

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.600
then we are going to miss the bus.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.710
You must understand the importance of
time.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.670
That is something people miss out.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.680
Sahaja Yoga is very good, because you're
blessed,

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.960
and you feel that you are secured,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.880
things are very good,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.830
you get so many brothers and sisters,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.840
and I see your faces just like roses shining;

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.600
all that is good, but still there is a chance

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.950
that you may fall back.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.830
The reason is, you must purify yourself.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.640
Never get satisfied with yourself.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.600
Some people, when I talk to them,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.600
they never think I am talking to them,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.710
they think I am talking to somebody else.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.880
So please try to understand,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.920
we have to introspect ourselves,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.710
we have to meditate,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.670
and when we are conscious about our own
defects,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.760
we’ll start looking at it and they’ll drop out.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.910
it’s a very tremendous task we have to do,

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.630
is to emancipate the whole human beings,

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.640
and for that,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.960
you have to be something very special.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.880
You have to be ideal.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.750
People are going to see you.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.680
l have seen some people who are very
fond

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.870
of going on the stage and trying to show
off.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.870
it’s ego, understand that, it is ego.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.960
lf you are not what you are talking,

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.910
nobody is going to take you seriously.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.750
On the contrary they'll disappear from
Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.840
lf you are going to show off,

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.600
people will say: ''Look at this show-off''

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.710
Everybody can see you being like that.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.910
They may not see themselves,

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.590
but they can see another person like that.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.760
So for all these ego manifestations,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.630
you have to be very, very careful.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.630
Now supposing if you have money

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.870
then you’ll try to show off,

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.790
if you have some power, supposing

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.800
you have certain position in the
government,

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.800
you’ll try to show off, anything, these
artificial things.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.910
I've known people who show off

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.920
for absurd things which has no meaning.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.670
l don't understand,

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.760
that these all things are outside,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.720
they are not enriching you,

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.630
they are in no way giving you the strength
that you need,

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.630
in no way making you beautiful.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.800
So all these outside things anybody can
have,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.670
it's nothing great about you,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.790
but the inner wealth that you develop

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.720
is the only way you can purify yourself,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.560
and the resurrection can take place

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.600
in the same manner as Christ has said.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.790
Now the time of resurrection has come,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.750
you are all resurrected,

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.720
but you have to still cleanse yourself.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.680
First as I told you, that morality

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.680
should be the highest priority for all of us.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.790
Now just think of the life people lead.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.640
For example, I have been in the West with
My husband

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.840
in another atmosphere, another society.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.750
We have been to parties,

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.600
we've been to all such things,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.840
and what I've found, that no man is safe,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.670
no woman is safe.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.720
They are all flirting with each other,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.550
God knows for what,

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.680
it's a joyless pursuit.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.840
And when they go back home what they
find,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.840
that the wife is missing or the husband is
missing.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.560
So such an insecure life they have

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.830
because they have no sense of morality.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.640
To them these pleasures are something
great,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.880
and because of this misunderstanding
about the

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.680
life,

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.550
they are suffering with such tremendous
insecurity.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.830
You have to guide your children

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.750
to a proper, sane morality.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.910
For that you must behave properly.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.550
You should not go romantic in the
presence of your children,

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.790
you should not try to put them in a way

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.720
that you lock up your rooms and do

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.590
all kinds of things,

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.950
but behave in a manner that is dignified.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.640
Otherwise children will pick up from you to
begin with.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.560
Then also you should be careful

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.840
as to the television and things that they
show,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.680
or what children see,

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.590
they have to be careful, and talk to them
that:

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.630
''This is wrong. This is very wrong,

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.950
and this will bring problems to us.''

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.920
lf you have a proper rapport with your
children

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.870
you won't have any problem.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.910
You see here they have so much of this
education,

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.680
despite that how many problems you have
with children.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.560
While we do not educate children in all
these things,

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.680
but we don't have these problems in India,

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.760
because you are kept just innocent about
it.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.720
lf the children are kept innocent

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.640
they never indulge into it,

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.560
and they would never get into any
problems

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.640
which are created by curiosity.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.910
Never make them curious.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.870
You will feel happy, the children will feel
happy,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.750
and they’ll start their life from the very
beginning,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.920
on the basis of morality.

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.680
This is what you have to give to your
children,

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.790
is a proper moral sense.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.600
Then another thing I have seen is

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.870
that, very important, is to give

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.910
for Sahaja Yoga your time.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.640
Many people do not give their time,

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.790
do not work in the ashrams,

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.750
they do not think that they have to do

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.670
something for Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.560
You must understand

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.920
that you are part and parcel of one body.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.920
Now supposing I do not allow one hand to
work,

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.800
put it in a sling, you'll find it will never work,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.670
it will become weak,

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.880
it will not be able to do anything, it will be
wasted.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.870
So you have to use all the limbs of the
body

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:32.880
in the same way,

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.600
you all must also put in physical,

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.870
mental, emotional,

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.790
whatever is possible for the work of Sahaja
Yoga,

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.680
because it is your work.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.880
l don't need Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.680
l don't have to do it.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.910
it’s for you I have started this,

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.910
and it is for you to give it to others.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.870
it’s your responsibility,

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.910
so you should take it up as your own.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.640
For example you know that at this age

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.670
l am traveling every third day or fourth day,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.590
and traveling long distances.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.710
All this I am doing, for what?

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.910
There's no need for Me to do,

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.710
l don't need anything.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.960
I’m just doing it because it's supposed to
be My life.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.720
l don't know how to explain why I'm doing it
really.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.950
Logically it doesn't sound sensible.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.840
But if you see Me,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.670
you say that we have great regard for
Mother,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.920
we respect Her very much,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.680
we are very fond of Her,

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.640
and we worship Her, all these things.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.680
But do you give so much as She can give?

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.840
How much do we give?

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.600
Secondly, I have also heard

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.600
that people are very miserly in giving
money

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.600
for My programs and things.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.760
You want Me to come here.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.680
l used to spend My own money in the early
days,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.720
but you don't want Me to come here

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.720
with My own money, is it proper? Is it?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.680
lf you have self-respect you would not like
Me to come,

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.800
spend My own money coming here,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.910
and spend money for building this,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.750
and spend money for your car's petrol.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.670
Would you like Me to do that?

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.870
No.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.830
So there are many people who come to
My program,

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.560
l am told, but do not pay for My programs.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.800
it’s very wrong.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.920
lf you do not pay, I tell you,

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.870
immediately you'll suffer,

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.560
and that is in money matters,

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.670
because if you do not give, money doesn't
come.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.680
Those people who have been generous

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.680
with their hands have been very
prosperous,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.560
even in Australia,

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.870
even in India.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.670
So I have to tell you, even this is not a
temptation to you,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.640
but when people say, ''Mother, our thing is
not coming up,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.840
this is not working out'',

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.880
so there's something wrong, somewhere
wrong.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.920
Once you start dedicating yourself to
Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.710
immediately you'll find things will work out.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.750
Something, there is something you have
done wrong

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.630
which you should not have done,

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.880
or something is, you have not understood,

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.720
you have done something under
misunderstanding,

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.920
try to find out.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.830
Things must sort out.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.680
They must soothe out in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.710
Everything sorts out.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.750
Not only that, but I have seen it just
becomes

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.670
absolutely beautifully falling into line,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.760
and you are amazed how it works out.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.800
From a small thing to big thing.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.880
So if it is not working out in your life,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.550
there's definitely something wrong.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.560
So it is the morality of your,

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.640
l should say, financial morality.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.670
Also there were some horrible mishaps

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.760
we had in this country of yours,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.670
where horrible leaders came

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.550
who were interested only in money,

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.830
that's how they came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.760
and what has happened to them, you
know that well.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.560
So you don't come to Sahaja Yoga for
money,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.560
you come here for everything,

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.630
in a sense, in totality,

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.600
you have to get that higher situation.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.840
Like that you have to

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.880
give also,

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.670
with an open heart.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.800
Know that you have got such a great gift,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.720
so now, what can I do about it?

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.640
Of course I don't need your money,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.600
l am not in the same position as even
Christ was,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.870
but He never took any money.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.600
So I need not take any money from you.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.710
But still, for other things,

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.560
those people who have not paid should
remember

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.710
that if they want their children to be all
right,

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.560
if they want their family to be all right,

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.710
if they want to be

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.870
all right as far as the money is concerned,

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.880
without feeling the ego,

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.670
without pressurizing the leaders,

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.760
try to spend money in a way

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.640
that is really useful for Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.880
Then another point is about the family,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.910
as I told you yesterday, that:

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.600
''My house, I must have my house, I must,
yes''.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.870
Specially leaders' wives.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.760
Again I should warn them, because

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.870
all this has created problems to such an
extent now,

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.920
that we had to throw them out of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.910
Despite the fact husbands were very good,

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.840
but some women wanted to have their own
home,

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.840
they wanted to have their own children,

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.840
they wanted to stay in their own.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.800
So this kind of a thing if a leader’s wife has
ideas,

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.800
then what will happen to others?

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.920
They have to follow an example

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.710
that is that of a leader,

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.720
and if a leader doesn't have that

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.800
and the wife doesn't have that example,

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.910
the whole thing can be absolutely in a

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.680
state of jeopardy,

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.910
and that's what I've seen,

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.870
that people suffer so much

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.880
when they do not realize

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.870
that we all are part and parcel of one
family.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.560
And we start thinking, imagine,

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.880
we cut one finger and plant it somewhere,

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.670
what will grow out of it?

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.600
Will a tree grow out of it?

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.710
or what will grow out of it?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.720
Nothing. It will stick.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.710
Till you were not joined with that whole
thing

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.830
you were all right,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.880
whether you were rotting in a place

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.560
or wherever you were, doesn't matter,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.960
but when now you have joined,

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.750
and when you are part and parcel of the
family,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.920
then see how you behave, how your
children are.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.680
Are they collective?

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.640
Are they sharing or they are fighting?

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.830
Try to see that your children can share

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.750
their things with others.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.640
And you first of all start doing that,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.640
otherwise children cannot do it.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.910
Now look at Christ,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.680
He lived hardly for four years,

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.920
in the sense that He was out of

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.960
that country.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.880
Only for four years He could work out the

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.630
mission that He had to fulfill.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.910
So He was

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.590
only there

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.720
to achieve this resurrection at the Agnya
chakra.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.600
In that short period,

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.670
how many beautiful parables He has
given,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.870
how many places He has been,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.750
how many people He has talked to.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.920
All His life He has spent like this.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.760
He lived in a very simple manner,

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.640
and He had no such tents, or anything,

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.800
so He used to go on mountains and
Mount,

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.800
you know, Sermon on the Mount is very
famous,

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.910
sermons are, and then He would gather
people there

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.640
and talk with them.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.600
They would listen to Him.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.760
But nobody imbibed anything that He said.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.710
Very few that He had, about twelve
disciples,

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.710
who also understood Him when He died,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.600
before that they did not understand what
He was.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.830
They could not

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.920
visualize actually within their minds,

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.550
''What is He doing,

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.840
what is He talking?''

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:31.640
But when He was resurrected that made
them think:

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.840
''Who was He, and what He has done?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.720
How is it we are His disciples?''

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.920
And they were ordinary fishermen,

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.710
you know that very well,

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.960
but their intelligence suddenly manifested,

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.720
their dynamism manifested,

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.590
and they really showed such good ways

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.600
of achieving

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.800
what we can call the second birth.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:07.840
Also, Christianity spread under wrong
banner

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.790
of Paul and Augustine,

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.640
and that's how we see the problems of
Christianity.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.950
So much so that we are shocked.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.720
How can Christianity of Christ would be
like this?

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.680
But it is,

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.560
and this Christianity of Christ that has
come

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.630
has nothing to do with Christ.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.790
And He has said it:

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.590
''You’ll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ,'

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.550
l won't recognize you.''

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.880
We are the people who are carrying this.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.880
And also He has said that they’ll be
wearing

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.670
a mark on their heads

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.760
and I will know who are the ones.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.840
So, as it is, you are already marked,

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.800
you are already been chosen by Christ

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.870
in His Last Judgment,

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.830
He has chosen you and you are there,

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.560
but still one should know that

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.670
there is all the possibility

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.600
that we could be hypocrites,

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.710
that we are playing with only words,

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.710
could be that we still have to cleanse
ourselves.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.760
So just put your mind into yourself,

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.550
and see for yourself

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.720
that: ''Where have I done wrong?''

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.760
As far as Mooladhara is concerned,

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.640
you people have a special responsibility.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.720
Australians have the greater responsibility

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.960
than anybody else,

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.760
because this is the place of Shri Ganesha.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.800
And if you do not fully understand

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.800
the significance of mooladhara clearing,

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.800
I’m sure you won't be able to achieve

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.880
any height in Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.560
So all of you should decide about this,

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.670
and work it out so that there is no problem

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.790
of your ascent, or your rising,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.600
because you're so pure or so beautiful.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.590
All this you have achieved already,

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.840
without much difficulty.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.920
Only thing is if those things which are left
behind,

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.680
suddenly are trying to come up also,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.640
you should not allow it to come into your
life,

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.910
you should just throw away.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.790
For example like a lotus leaf,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.920
when it is under the water it doesn't show
anything,

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.790
but when it comes up,

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.640
then water doesn't stand on that,

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.800
it just falls off.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.880
Doesn't get attached to any water.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.960
You may pour water, any amount - it just
takes off.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.750
So this is what you have to find out.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.950
Relationships between each other,

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.880
racialism and other things,

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.920
we have to just oppose it.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.790
it’s not a good thing to hate anyone

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.830
for anything small like that.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.560
The forgiving quality of Christ

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.880
at the time when He was crucified

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.670
has to be remembered.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.680
How He forgave those who crucified Him

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.800
because they do not know what they are
doing.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.750
But even when they know

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.720
what they are doing in Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.870
still people try to crucify.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.870
And this crucifixion can be

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.680
all right for the person who is crucified,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.800
but very dangerous for the person who is
crucifying.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.880
So this has to be understood,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.670
that to get rid of all these things,

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.560
and to get out of all your crucifixions,

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.830
you have to have an extremely pure,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.680
ideal, beautiful life.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.950
You should be proud of your virtues.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.600
You should be proud of your greatness.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.790
You should be proud that you are so
righteous.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.880
There's nothing to feel bad about.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.920
Otherwise people will boast about their
bad things

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.840
as in the modern times,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.800
but not about their good things,

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.750
regarded as bad manners.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.870
You need not boast of both the things,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.830
but you can be proud

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.920
of the things that are so beautiful,

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.720
so nice, so energy-giving.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.720
Christ had to surrender to the desire of His
Father,

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.680
and He asked Him that:

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.790
''If You could take away this cup, it would
be nice.''

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.600
But when the Father said: ''No,

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.630
you have to drink this cup,''

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.640
He accepted, and He went through it

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.720
very bravely, and beautifully.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.640
We have to have the same kind of
surrender,

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.720
that whatever we have to do,

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.720
we should do it with a surrender.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.590
We should not think

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.920
that we are achieving something by that,

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.600
we are showing off by that, or anything.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.830
Just you should feel that it's being done

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.760
because we are surrendering.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.680
We should feel our surrender as a great
blessing.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.880
lf you can put your attention to your heart,

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.600
and just say that: ''l surrender myself',

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.790
that's more than sufficient.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.670
But you shouldn't say that: ''Mother, please

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.910
help me to surrender.''

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.830
l mean, how can Mother help you?

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.600
All these prayers sometimes are

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.680
escapes from reality.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.600
''You just help me, help me, this.''

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.760
To surrender is very easy.

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.760
Just you have to say: ''Mother, come in my
heart,

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.950
and come in my head,

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.680
and come in my attention,''

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.870
that's all.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.790
Go on saying like that:

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.630
''Please come in my heart,

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.920
come in my head,

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.870
and come in my attention'',

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.830
and as you would go on saying, Kundalini
will rise

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.920
and She will cleanse you completely.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.590
She's the One who cleanses you.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.750
All the time She's cleansing your chakras.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.640
But problem is we always spoil them.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.800
Again and again,

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.760
both thing again and again rises and does
that.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.920
So all these problems are

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.550
because we are not introspecting.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.910
Also I've seen people are very attach to
their wife

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.870
or attached to their husbands,

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.590
then they cannot see anybody else.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.920
For them, everything is wrong but for
themselves,

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.920
not their husbands or their wives.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.640
This is, seems to be very common failure.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.640
This kind of false attachment

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.880
not only will harm another person,

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.880
but will harm your husband or your wife.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.630
Because they will also get away with
wrong things.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.710
Once they start getting away with wrong
things,

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.960
there's no end to it,

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.790
and they’ll be destroyed.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.870
Now the task before Me is to go to

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.750
area of Visshuddhi, in America,

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.920
which is another very difficult task.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.840
And unless and until that is put right,

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.790
My throat cannot be all right,

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.720
so I have to jolly well do it,

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.590
and I have to work it out.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.870
But as you know, Americans have

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.680
something wrong with their upper storey.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.630
l just don't understand.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.910
They like people who take money from
them

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.720
and who befool them,

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.960
who have Rolls Royces, all kinds of things,

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.560
can you imagine?

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.800
They would not have Me on the television,

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.550
because I have no Rolls Royce.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.760
l mean, in the television, in the
government,

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.840
can you imagine such a television where
they don't

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.800
take you up because you have no Rolls
Royces?

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.720
it’s not prestigious.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.640
lf I have a Rolls Royce by cheating
everyone,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.910
then it's very prestigious, it's a business.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.950
So, with all these things happening,

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.600
one feels that the level of spirituality

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.640
is really great

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.600
in a place like Australia

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.710
which is cut off from the world,

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.790
which is so much away.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:21.680
The spirituality is very well expressed here

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.590
and I'm sure in Sahaja Yoga they will rise
very high,

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.710
if they keep to one understanding,

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.880
that they are living on the

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.630
soil of Shri Ganesha.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.760
How important it is,

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.910
how you live,

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.870
with what purity

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.840
and with what understanding.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.960
So today is the day of Christ's resurrection,

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.920
you should say, it's a resurrection for all of
us.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.630
He has the One, He is the One who
managed it,

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.960
who did everything for us,

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.670
and He's the One who has helped us so
much,

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.840
otherwise Kundalini well

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.920
could never have entered into Sahasrara.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.640
So one has to be really very much thankful
to Him

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.870
from your heart,

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.870
plus you should try to imbibe His qualities.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.960
One other quality is there, of course,

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.590
that when people try to criticize your
Mother

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.750
or try to insult your Mother,

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.920
you get angry, that is just like Christ,

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.840
He could not tolerate any insult,

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.750
or any kind of a neglect of His Mother.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.920
He Himself has said that this will not be
tolerated.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.910
In the same way you people also,

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.600
if you have only for that, I am with you.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.870
I’m absolutely with you,

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.830
that you do not have

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.800
any more the feeling

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.560
of

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.870
guilt, or anything within yourself.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.920
When you understand

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.710
that whatever you are doing,

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.640
you are doing with complete sincerity,

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.920
with complete understanding.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.870
Even if you make mistakes, it doesn't
matter.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.840
The mistake will bring forth something lack,

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.680
but you have to be extremely sincere,

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.600
this feeling should be within you.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.630
Look at the feeling of Christ.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.800
l mean, He crucified Himself.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.800
He asked for the trouble.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.640
He went all the way there,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.750
there was no need for Him to go,

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.950
enter into that area,

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.830
and He got this.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.710
Of course,

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.720
you are not going to be crucified

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.760
now for your resurrection, not at all,

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.670
but

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.600
in a way

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.630
you have to crucify whatever is ugly,

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.800
whatever is wrong,

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.920
whatever is detrimental to your growth.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.790
You have to become really very beautiful
people,

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.790
very beautiful.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.640
Anybody who talks to you,

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.800
anybody who sees you should say that:

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.720
''I met such and such person, very
beautiful,

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.680
and then I asked, 'How is it you're so
beautiful?'

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.920
and the person said that 'I’m a Sahaja
Yogini'''.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.950
it’s a very, very common

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.920
experience of Mine,

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.790
very common experience.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.680
And the main thing is

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.720
that you have to respect

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.670
your self-realization,

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.800
your resurrection has to be respected.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.640
lf you do not respect your resurrection,

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.560
you are not going to help yourself or
others.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.750
l met once by chance,

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:56.880
the High Court Judge of Hague High
Court,

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.670
which is a World High Court.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.800
Just in Romania.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.600
He was sitting there.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.800
l was also sitting, and he was looking at
Me.

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.600
Trying to locate him, I couldn't locate him.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.640
And then we went to Paris,

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.880
and he was also in Paris.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.720
Frankfurt, he was changing,

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.670
and I was also changing there.

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.630
So he just came and asked: ''By the way,

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.640
have I met You before?''

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:23.880
l said: ''Maybe.''

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.790
l knew who he was but I kept quiet.

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.560
He said: ''You know I'm such and such,

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:30.790
and I went to India

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.870
and there was a lady who cured me,

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.640
are You the one?''

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.760
l said: ''Yes, I am such and such''.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:38.840
All right.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:44.750
Then what he told Me was most
encouraging, was this.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.720
He said: ''That time You cured me I felt
gratified,

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.640
l thought You were one of the healers and
all that.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.640
But when I saw the life of Dr Nagen,

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.560
this is my colleague, the way he's
transformed,

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.920
the way he had become such a good man,

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.840
such a wonderful person, I asked him
once:

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.720
'What, what has made you so good,

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.830
how can you be such a good man in these
bad times,

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.870
when from every side there's such an
attack?'''

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.910
And also he took a very big stand.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.920
'''And what, what was the thing?

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:30.720
What made you such a good person?

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.680
You are living in a place like this,

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.630
and you know how

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.630
Hague is surrounded by all kinds of
criminals

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.950
and drugs and all that.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.910
And you are such a nice, and a beautiful
saintly person.

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.960
What has made you?'''

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.670
''So then he told me,

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.590
'You remember the lady who cured you,

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.710
She has changed me completely.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.950
It is because of Her I have become a Yogi,

00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.750
and that's why my life has changed,

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.600
because it gives you the strength.'''

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.880
So this man told Me, I was really very
much touched.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.830
So he said: ''Now can I have Your
photograph?''

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.710
l said: ''l don't have any photograph.''

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.750
There were three, four Sahaja Yogis with
Me,

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.590
they were wearing the badges,

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.870
but only there was one badge.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.590
But the Secretary of the Hague High Court

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.960
was also with him.

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.960
He got so much interested, so he said:

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.720
''Can I have the badge?''

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:26.600
So we gave it to this judge, so the other
fellow says:

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.680
''What about me?

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.550
l would also like to have a badge.''

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:30.790
l said: ''Are you going to carry this badge?''

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.560
''Yes, yes, of course.'' immediately he wore
it.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.590
Suddenly Matteus found another badge,

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.630
but they had gone to the airplane.

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.830
Then he ran there and he told the air
hostess:

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.950
''Give it to the gentleman.''

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.720
''Ah, I saw one with this badge. All right,

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.880
I’ll give it to the other.'' And she took it
inside.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.790
Can you imagine these people of such
high society,

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.880
l should say, so highly placed in life,

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.590
such intellectuals,

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.720
they are the judges of the Supreme High
Court,

00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.830
in the sense that it's the super, most

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.800
High Court in Hague, World High Court,

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.590
and so humbled down, because

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.920
of one person whom they saw so changed.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.710
So you can imagine how you can change
your colleagues,

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.840
how you can show better results

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.800
by your proper dignified behavior.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.720
it’s going to work out very well if you have
that example.

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.760
And Christ, why He impressed people so
much?

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.920
Because of His personal life.

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.910
In His personal life He showed

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.830
how powerful He was,

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.920
and then, and His death, He showed

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.670
by His resurrection that He was something

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.560
beyond human comprehension,

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.560
where He has just become

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.840
resurrected after death.

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.840
Must be that He was absolutely purity
personified,

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.560
which He was.

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.640
So today we have to place ourselves

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.960
in such a manner

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:05.800
that we ask for purity, and purity, and purity,

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.560
and that we are going to work out

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.800
this purity within ourselves with full
sincerity.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.560
We are not going to get into ego trip,

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.760
and think that we are perfectly all right. No,

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.600
we are just going to ask

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.720
for complete purity within ourselves.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.880
This is what the great, what Christ has
given us,

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.800
which we should achieve,

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.880
and we should really show

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.590
that we can achieve that purity within
ourselves.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.630
Whatever has happened you forget it,

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.790
you don't worry on that point,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.750
whatever has happened is a gone case,

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.560
but whatever has to happen is this,

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.910
that you all should ask for purity,

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.870
all criticism, all hatred

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.880
and all those things will disappear,

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.670
plus the purity will give you

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.600
that unique position

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.880
that when people will even see your life,

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:56.950
they will change.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.640
Only by seeing your life, they will change.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.680
l hope this works out very well here,

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.750
and maybe by the time I come next time,

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.840
we’ll have lots, lots of Sahaja Yogis,

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.720
beautifully connected to each other,

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.560
beautifully having relations with each other,

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.910
and these children growing up

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.960
very fast as well.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.640
l hope to come back here

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.750
again to the land of Shri Ganesha

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.910
where Purity has taken over.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.800
May God Bless You.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.600
Easter Puja is a simple Puja in a way,

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.590
because we just...

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.630
of course the Footwashing has to be there
by children,

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.800
because that's the special day today,

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.880
but otherwise it's a much simpler Puja,

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.630
and it doesn't take all those things that

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.880
we normally do.
