WEBVTT

00:06.554 --> 00:11.054
It was very spontaneously decided

00:11.214 --> 00:21.014
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

00:25.846 --> 00:30.288
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

00:30.448 --> 00:33.927
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

00:34.087 --> 00:37.927
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

00:49.199 --> 00:54.719
We have to today understand

00:55.215 --> 00:59.535
that why do we do Devi Puja?

01:00.760 --> 01:07.600
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

01:08.231 --> 01:11.150
What do we get out of it?

01:11.310 --> 01:16.945
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

01:17.105 --> 01:20.259
within ourselves?

01:23.217 --> 01:30.137
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

01:30.847 --> 01:34.367
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

01:35.840 --> 01:39.027
So when you worship Devi,

01:39.187 --> 01:43.429
first you worship also your own Kundalini

01:43.589 --> 01:50.594
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

01:51.359 --> 01:54.128
It’s much deeper understanding

01:54.288 --> 01:58.057
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

01:58.217 --> 02:01.638
because they are not realized souls.

02:01.798 --> 02:04.289
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

02:04.449 --> 02:07.800
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

02:07.960 --> 02:09.776
of getting realization

02:09.936 --> 02:12.415
so that the Devi should be pleased

02:12.575 --> 02:16.137
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

02:16.297 --> 02:19.547
or must get our chance to get to somebody

02:19.707 --> 02:23.255
who will give them realization.

02:24.830 --> 02:27.744
But you are at a different level now.

02:27.904 --> 02:32.334
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

02:32.494 --> 02:34.760
and to Adi Shakti,

02:34.920 --> 02:41.589
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

02:41.749 --> 02:45.272
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

02:45.432 --> 02:51.424
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

02:53.271 --> 02:57.636
But one has to know that

02:58.012 --> 03:06.271
only we are realized souls is not the point,

03:06.431 --> 03:11.311
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

03:12.711 --> 03:18.232
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

03:20.864 --> 03:25.040
Then what is it? Very important –

03:25.200 --> 03:29.001
it’s the content within us.

03:29.340 --> 03:33.944
What do we have within us is the point.

03:34.104 --> 03:37.697
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

03:37.857 --> 03:41.679
Supposing somebody is generous,

03:41.839 --> 03:47.160
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

03:47.320 --> 03:52.600
So the content within us, we have to see.

03:53.574 --> 03:57.924
And when we start seeing the content,

04:02.600 --> 04:07.306
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

04:07.466 --> 04:14.531
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

04:16.392 --> 04:20.594
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

04:20.754 --> 04:26.329
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

04:26.489 --> 04:29.673
and gives rain.

04:33.424 --> 04:37.881
But sea is the lowest level,

04:38.398 --> 04:40.082
stands at the lowest level

04:40.242 --> 04:44.583
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.817
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

04:50.977 --> 04:57.329
to be really achieving more content,

04:57.489 --> 05:07.249
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

05:09.425 --> 05:12.081
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

05:12.241 --> 05:15.232
but I think it was not explained to people.

05:15.392 --> 05:20.506
Only the strong people can be meek,

05:20.666 --> 05:23.753
secured people can be meek,

05:23.913 --> 05:29.464
only the rich in essence can be meek,

05:29.624 --> 05:36.091
not the people who are insecured.

05:36.251 --> 05:40.831
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

05:43.040 --> 05:48.648
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

05:48.808 --> 05:52.794
because if they are rich they are not generous,

05:52.954 --> 05:57.545
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

05:57.705 --> 06:02.887
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

06:05.576 --> 06:11.369
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

06:14.456 --> 06:19.485
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

06:22.151 --> 06:27.351
But when you love Me,

06:27.975 --> 06:32.408
you have to know that there are certain qualities

06:32.568 --> 06:36.608
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.936
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

06:43.096 --> 06:45.936
They think they can get over everything,

06:46.096 --> 06:48.416
they’re perfectly all right,

06:48.576 --> 06:52.532
and they are thrown overboard.

06:56.729 --> 06:59.295
So when we say that we have to be meek,

06:59.455 --> 07:04.818
this is a content, the humility is a content.

07:05.230 --> 07:10.070
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.470
You’ll like yourself.

07:16.110 --> 07:19.774
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

07:19.934 --> 07:24.181
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

07:25.157 --> 07:29.560
And what is another thing we find has content

07:29.814 --> 07:33.263
are the great mountains,

07:33.423 --> 07:36.710
because they have heights

07:36.870 --> 07:43.102
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.590
So such a rapport there is

07:45.750 --> 07:51.175
between the humility of the ocean

07:51.335 --> 07:55.559
and the heights of the mountain.

07:55.719 --> 07:58.871
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

07:59.031 --> 08:06.751
He is too high because so much of

08:11.684 --> 08:15.190
content is there in that ocean,

08:15.350 --> 08:18.550
then it has become beautiful

08:18.710 --> 08:26.910
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

08:27.070 --> 08:30.125
where resides the Shiva.

08:30.285 --> 08:34.645
So it’s so joy-giving.

08:36.093 --> 08:39.270
Of course as you have painted Me there,

08:39.430 --> 08:43.550
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.110
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

08:46.270 --> 08:48.070
in a very subtle manner,

08:48.230 --> 08:51.310
because there’s so much of negativity

08:51.470 --> 08:58.670
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

09:05.093 --> 09:09.150
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

09:09.310 --> 09:13.684
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

09:13.844 --> 09:17.685
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

09:17.845 --> 09:21.046
there is a little blessing;

09:21.206 --> 09:26.174
goes, I would say, a long rope.

09:27.510 --> 09:33.590
But that long rope one should not care for.

09:33.750 --> 09:38.270
You have to care for your own quality,

09:38.430 --> 09:43.990
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

09:44.590 --> 09:47.598
Now look at the ocean as it is.

09:47.758 --> 09:54.421
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

09:55.006 --> 10:01.215
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

10:01.375 --> 10:04.758
Only possible in the ocean.

10:04.918 --> 10:08.150
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

10:08.310 --> 10:10.895
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

10:11.055 --> 10:14.210
inexhaustible.

10:14.370 --> 10:21.290
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

10:21.913 --> 10:26.288
and that can go and touch the heart.

10:26.448 --> 10:30.331
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

10:30.491 --> 10:36.269
where there is Shiva residing.

10:36.913 --> 10:42.033
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

10:42.417 --> 10:47.017
and unless and until you have that largeness,

10:47.209 --> 10:53.748
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

10:53.908 --> 10:58.650
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

10:58.810 --> 11:02.930
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

11:03.090 --> 11:04.850
it never leaves.

11:05.010 --> 11:08.770
If Pacific Ocean was

11:08.930 --> 11:13.258
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

11:13.418 --> 11:19.370
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

11:19.530 --> 11:21.418
it has its own maryadas.

11:21.578 --> 11:26.530
But in that maryada he has the feeling

11:26.690 --> 11:30.298
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

11:30.458 --> 11:34.107
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

11:34.267 --> 11:39.334
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.890
Nature is bound by the Divine.

11:45.050 --> 11:47.050
The Divine looks after the nature.

11:47.210 --> 11:51.736
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

11:51.896 --> 11:56.396
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

11:57.210 --> 12:01.346
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

12:01.506 --> 12:08.730
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

12:08.890 --> 12:14.386
You are above that like a mountain.

12:15.455 --> 12:19.747
And so wherever there is a combination

12:19.907 --> 12:25.108
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

12:26.144 --> 12:29.562
Deep people can only come to such shores

12:29.722 --> 12:32.417
where there is depth.

12:32.577 --> 12:35.810
That’s how you achieve your depth,

12:35.970 --> 12:42.170
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

12:42.458 --> 12:45.843
that beautiful area where people can come to you

12:46.003 --> 12:50.635
and just they know this is something great,

12:54.184 --> 12:57.650
everybody knows that.

12:57.810 --> 13:01.930
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

13:02.090 --> 13:06.784
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

13:07.377 --> 13:11.410
But how many people come to My program?

13:11.570 --> 13:14.555
How do they come to My program? Must think.

13:14.715 --> 13:19.628
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

13:27.153 --> 13:30.770
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

13:30.930 --> 13:34.358
And people had no place to sit.

13:34.518 --> 13:37.961
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

13:38.121 --> 13:42.230
there are no books published, nothing.

13:45.170 --> 13:48.290
So you can say that, “Mother,

13:48.450 --> 13:53.152
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

13:53.312 --> 13:57.752
I do not, but it does – I think so.

13:59.330 --> 14:06.555
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

14:06.744 --> 14:10.418
the collective unconscious,

14:10.578 --> 14:16.178
the Divine will act, definitely act.

14:17.130 --> 14:20.650
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

14:20.810 --> 14:24.090
this that, yes people come.

14:24.250 --> 14:29.410
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

14:29.570 --> 14:31.250
But where there is no money involved,

14:31.410 --> 14:33.938
no business involved, nothing,

14:34.098 --> 14:40.675
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

14:41.617 --> 14:46.377
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

14:47.937 --> 14:51.730
So the Divine works it out.

14:51.890 --> 14:58.305
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

14:58.465 --> 15:03.657
then even if I am there it does not work.

15:03.817 --> 15:08.177
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

15:08.609 --> 15:11.875
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

15:12.035 --> 15:15.681
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

15:15.841 --> 15:19.618
a complete faith in yourself.

15:19.778 --> 15:25.018
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

15:26.890 --> 15:28.954
And what is this ocean?

15:29.114 --> 15:33.474
It’s love, it’s love and love.

15:35.570 --> 15:40.053
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

15:40.213 --> 15:43.010
It just works spontaneously.

15:43.170 --> 15:46.650
The less you do the better.

15:47.530 --> 15:51.576
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

15:51.736 --> 15:56.160
you just develop your content within yourself.

16:00.289 --> 16:02.714
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

16:02.874 --> 16:05.801
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

16:05.961 --> 16:09.402
They had to go into jungles, they had to

16:09.562 --> 16:13.417
take all the wrath of their gurus

16:13.577 --> 16:18.173
and nobody to protect them.

16:19.247 --> 16:24.044
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

16:26.226 --> 16:28.570
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

16:28.730 --> 16:33.490
whose power is all this Divine.

16:34.359 --> 16:38.090
So you are at such an advantageous position.

16:38.250 --> 16:41.075
But first you must realize.

16:41.235 --> 16:45.130
So when we say we should have content,

16:45.290 --> 16:49.490
then the vessel has to be strong

16:50.241 --> 16:54.730
otherwise everything will break.

16:54.890 --> 16:58.424
And this strength is the one you should know,

16:58.584 --> 17:02.864
that you are completely protected.

17:03.330 --> 17:05.299
No one can harm you.

17:05.459 --> 17:06.586
They’ll try.

17:06.746 --> 17:09.148
This has to be otherwise how will you test

17:09.308 --> 17:12.530
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

17:12.690 --> 17:15.936
So somebody has to try some tricks

17:16.096 --> 17:22.036
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

17:22.196 --> 17:24.410
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

17:24.570 --> 17:26.596
everything will be cleared out.

17:26.756 --> 17:29.194
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

17:29.354 --> 17:33.074
how things have worked out.

17:35.690 --> 17:37.850
So the strength comes.

17:38.010 --> 17:42.390
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

17:42.550 --> 17:46.195
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

17:46.355 --> 17:48.898
Shraddha is not blind faith.

17:49.058 --> 17:52.610
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

17:52.770 --> 17:56.010
you know everything.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.656
You’ve seen My photographs,

18:00.816 --> 18:03.170
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

18:03.330 --> 18:06.160
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

18:06.320 --> 18:10.283
you can feel the vibrations;

18:12.065 --> 18:15.481
you can feel others', you can cure others.

18:15.641 --> 18:18.170
All this power is within you.

18:18.330 --> 18:22.170
But just to realize

18:23.168 --> 18:27.770
that power without ego is your strength.

18:27.930 --> 18:30.170
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

18:30.330 --> 18:32.506
because what is the need there?

18:32.666 --> 18:36.330
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

18:36.490 --> 18:40.074
because you want to have more, more, more.

18:40.234 --> 18:45.806
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

18:46.010 --> 18:51.162
So this power is to be ascertained first,

18:51.322 --> 18:55.490
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

18:55.650 --> 18:57.818
to find out first.

18:57.978 --> 19:01.145
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

19:01.305 --> 19:03.082
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

19:03.242 --> 19:06.522
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

19:12.109 --> 19:16.490
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

19:16.650 --> 19:22.210
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

19:22.370 --> 19:25.210
who have reached great heights and some

19:25.370 --> 19:27.970
who are outside.

19:28.130 --> 19:30.050
All these are negative forces

19:30.210 --> 19:33.450
which were killed long time back.

19:37.938 --> 19:42.458
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

19:43.554 --> 19:48.468
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

19:48.705 --> 19:52.825
but you have so many of them.

19:53.930 --> 19:57.057
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

19:57.217 --> 19:59.564
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

19:59.724 --> 20:04.404
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

20:10.050 --> 20:16.323
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

20:16.483 --> 20:21.456
you must have complete faith in yourself.

20:21.730 --> 20:25.198
If you still doubt yourself,

20:27.937 --> 20:30.650
that’s also a human quality.

20:30.810 --> 20:33.243
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

20:33.403 --> 20:38.258
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

20:40.370 --> 20:42.010
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

20:42.170 --> 20:44.450
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.936
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

20:48.096 --> 20:53.656
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

20:59.610 --> 21:06.530
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

21:06.690 --> 21:12.330
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

21:13.650 --> 21:16.155
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

21:16.315 --> 21:19.113
I am still doing like this, then how?”

21:19.273 --> 21:22.250
Then get rid of it!

21:22.410 --> 21:24.170
I mean, how can I solve your problem

21:24.330 --> 21:26.650
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

21:26.810 --> 21:28.770
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

21:28.930 --> 21:31.170
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.370
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

21:33.530 --> 21:36.641
this is what is the answer.

21:36.801 --> 21:39.588
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

21:39.748 --> 21:46.440
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

21:48.880 --> 21:53.746
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

21:53.906 --> 21:58.180
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

22:00.824 --> 22:03.687
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

22:03.847 --> 22:06.650
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

22:06.810 --> 22:10.554
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.502
None of them!

22:15.090 --> 22:19.210
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

22:19.370 --> 22:23.777
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

22:23.937 --> 22:26.367
This is the, they could have said that

22:26.527 --> 22:30.578
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

22:30.738 --> 22:33.370
They had enough of everything, they must have.

22:33.530 --> 22:36.263
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

22:36.423 --> 22:39.832
very big professions, very humble,

22:39.992 --> 22:45.503
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

22:45.663 --> 22:48.170
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

22:48.330 --> 22:50.658
They wouldn’t even touch My sari like that.

22:50.818 --> 22:54.464
The place I walk they wouldn’t touch, just imagine.

22:54.624 --> 22:59.940
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

23:00.490 --> 23:03.232
How did they recognize Me?

23:03.392 --> 23:08.944
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

23:09.104 --> 23:11.665
And they never talked about God in that country.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.945
They have some stupid people who have

23:14.105 --> 23:19.775
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

23:19.935 --> 23:24.130
most of the people are so strong

23:24.290 --> 23:27.330
and the content is showing itself.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.930
Imagine every time they have a program,

23:30.090 --> 23:31.690
even now on follow-on,

23:31.850 --> 23:36.090
at least one thousand people are there.

23:38.345 --> 23:43.694
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

23:44.450 --> 23:47.208
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

23:47.368 --> 23:50.330
from Siberia, this, that.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.857
And they have booked themselves,

23:52.017 --> 23:54.770
because there the halls you have to pay for.

23:54.930 --> 23:58.050
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

23:58.210 --> 24:03.240
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

24:03.400 --> 24:07.306
not to work it out, take it easy,

24:08.636 --> 24:12.090
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.010
We don’t have to kill demons.

24:15.170 --> 24:21.450
There’s no need to join any war

24:21.770 --> 24:28.010
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

24:28.770 --> 24:32.130
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

24:32.290 --> 24:37.015
lethargy from you, but work it out.

24:39.130 --> 24:43.055
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

24:43.215 --> 24:46.530
but you have to keep them awakened.

24:46.690 --> 24:51.130
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.450
Not the way to meditate,

24:52.610 --> 24:55.010
"All right, it’s like playing golf, it’s out."

24:55.170 --> 25:00.290
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

25:00.450 --> 25:05.218
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

25:05.378 --> 25:11.922
With that complete understanding and dedication

25:12.313 --> 25:17.890
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

25:18.050 --> 25:22.254
It’s something very subtle and special.

25:22.570 --> 25:27.426
In no action we can describe it,

25:27.610 --> 25:35.370
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

25:36.330 --> 25:39.010
To that depth no other feeling goes;

25:39.185 --> 25:42.731
with that feeling you have to meditate.

25:42.891 --> 25:44.839
And then see the results.

25:44.999 --> 25:47.570
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

25:47.730 --> 25:49.890
I’ve this still” –

25:50.050 --> 25:55.730
because you are not deep enough.

25:57.323 --> 26:02.210
It’s not how much you pray,

26:02.370 --> 26:06.650
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

26:06.810 --> 26:11.984
but it is how deeply you have touched

26:13.250 --> 26:21.450
the feet of the Divine that is important.

26:22.290 --> 26:27.485
So today we have to see that

26:27.645 --> 26:34.597
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

26:36.250 --> 26:39.330
so that all negativity runs away,

26:39.490 --> 26:45.403
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

26:45.563 --> 26:48.603
for Shiva to settle down.

26:49.090 --> 26:54.690
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

26:54.850 --> 26:57.050
It’s like an operation

26:57.210 --> 27:01.570
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

27:01.730 --> 27:03.850
you never even felt it.

27:04.010 --> 27:07.970
The other day somebody gave Me a book of... [on the devilish?]

27:08.130 --> 27:11.370
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

27:11.530 --> 27:13.690
– it’s correct, no doubt,

27:13.850 --> 27:16.730
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

27:16.890 --> 27:19.370
meaning 'without percussions'.

27:19.530 --> 27:21.290
But I was reading that book, I said,

27:21.450 --> 27:25.250
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

27:25.410 --> 27:27.570
going into ‘this means, that means'."

27:27.770 --> 27:30.690
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

27:30.850 --> 27:34.210
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

27:34.370 --> 27:38.410
and they know it so easily.

27:38.570 --> 27:43.090
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

27:43.250 --> 27:46.570
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

27:46.730 --> 27:51.370
has come to you so beautifully,

27:52.690 --> 27:57.130
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

28:00.370 --> 28:05.770
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

28:05.930 --> 28:09.113
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

28:09.273 --> 28:16.233
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

28:19.798 --> 28:22.851
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

28:23.011 --> 28:25.775
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

28:25.935 --> 28:28.330
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

28:28.490 --> 28:30.690
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

28:30.850 --> 28:33.728
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

28:33.888 --> 28:35.970
You see, human beings are great experts,

28:36.130 --> 28:38.730
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

28:38.890 --> 28:42.148
Nothing goes inside the heart.

28:45.695 --> 28:49.415
But you have to develop that depth.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.650
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

28:51.810 --> 28:54.370
not through our brains.

28:54.602 --> 28:58.182
You have to develop that heart

29:00.552 --> 29:08.498
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

29:11.066 --> 29:16.209
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

29:16.369 --> 29:19.243
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

29:19.403 --> 29:21.067
Any intelligent man can see that,

29:21.227 --> 29:23.495
there’s no need to have his realization.

29:23.655 --> 29:26.530
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

29:26.690 --> 29:29.850
and he trusts. He trusts

29:30.010 --> 29:34.731
himself then because he’s wise.

29:35.986 --> 29:39.785
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.618
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

29:43.778 --> 29:49.722
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

29:49.882 --> 29:51.849
as you can see it clearly.

29:52.009 --> 29:56.489
Of course, symbolically it is the same

29:56.817 --> 30:00.744
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

30:00.904 --> 30:05.744
The first work is to destroy the negativity

30:06.170 --> 30:08.193
which is going on as you know.

30:08.353 --> 30:11.489
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

30:11.649 --> 30:15.295
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

30:15.455 --> 30:19.135
But you are the lights.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.610
You have to put the lights on

30:23.962 --> 30:26.258
and you have to look after your light,

30:26.418 --> 30:32.098
and you have to make that light eternal.

30:34.288 --> 30:39.928
This is one work which you are doing.

30:41.890 --> 30:45.370
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

30:45.530 --> 30:50.970
is to spread light, enlighten people.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.770
The negativity that is around you

30:54.930 --> 30:58.730
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

30:59.010 --> 31:01.663
Today it has become subtler.

31:01.823 --> 31:04.490
The negativity has become subtler.

31:04.650 --> 31:06.898
It’s entered into your being,

31:07.058 --> 31:12.017
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

31:15.336 --> 31:18.136
Even one step

31:18.530 --> 31:21.035
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

31:21.195 --> 31:23.715
you can go down.

31:24.064 --> 31:27.875
So one has to be alert, without tension.

31:28.035 --> 31:31.360
You have to be alert without tension.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.090
And the alertness grows.

31:35.250 --> 31:39.642
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

31:39.802 --> 31:42.177
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

31:42.337 --> 31:46.503
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

31:46.663 --> 31:51.289
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

31:51.449 --> 31:53.090
And immediately you take to it.

31:53.250 --> 31:57.930
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

31:58.090 --> 32:01.330
immediately you clean it.

32:03.489 --> 32:11.955
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

32:12.115 --> 32:14.905
'daksha' is the word for that.

32:15.065 --> 32:19.011
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.490
Goddess used to give enlightenment

32:21.650 --> 32:24.259
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

32:24.419 --> 32:28.459
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

32:28.650 --> 32:30.810
They are praying, they are doing puja,

32:30.970 --> 32:35.619
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

32:35.779 --> 32:38.607
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

32:38.767 --> 32:41.026
from all negativity coming,

32:41.186 --> 32:44.319
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

32:44.479 --> 32:50.582
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

32:52.210 --> 32:54.576
So you have to kill your negativity,

32:54.736 --> 32:59.518
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

33:00.578 --> 33:04.858
No negativity can touch you.

33:05.699 --> 33:10.417
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

33:10.577 --> 33:16.937
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

33:18.090 --> 33:21.610
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

33:21.770 --> 33:25.970
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

33:26.130 --> 33:29.473
By that nobody is going to gain.

33:30.295 --> 33:34.523
At the collective level it just works automatically.

33:34.683 --> 33:36.294
You don’t have to worry.

33:36.454 --> 33:40.690
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

33:40.850 --> 33:44.850
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

33:45.010 --> 33:47.730
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

33:47.890 --> 33:50.250
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

33:50.410 --> 33:55.150
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

33:58.723 --> 34:02.051
Now another quality that you have:

34:02.211 --> 34:04.610
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

34:04.770 --> 34:08.690
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

34:08.850 --> 34:11.370
it’s penetrated into you

34:11.530 --> 34:18.930
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

34:21.130 --> 34:26.412
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

34:26.737 --> 34:29.890
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

34:30.050 --> 34:34.418
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

34:34.609 --> 34:38.890
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

34:39.050 --> 34:40.450
you get the cool from there.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.450
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

34:43.610 --> 34:44.930
you give bliss to others.

34:45.090 --> 34:47.570
But there is no bliss within yourself,

34:47.730 --> 34:50.521
but what bliss you can give to others?

34:50.681 --> 34:53.905
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

34:54.065 --> 34:56.105
You see She has very extreme characters,

34:56.271 --> 35:00.706
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

35:00.866 --> 35:02.610
She can be very cruel,

35:02.770 --> 35:06.905
and She can be extremely gentle

35:07.065 --> 35:10.892
– like two ragas of yesterday.

35:12.250 --> 35:25.607
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

35:25.767 --> 35:29.538
beyond all human expectations,

35:29.698 --> 35:36.098
and She could be extremely mild.

35:39.050 --> 35:46.130
So this harsh part you need not have.

35:46.370 --> 35:48.370
It will just work.

35:48.530 --> 35:52.090
This part is only kept for the Divine.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.928
You just take to the other side.

35:55.088 --> 35:58.690
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

35:58.850 --> 36:00.770
After all, Divine also must do some work.

36:00.930 --> 36:08.130
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

36:08.706 --> 36:12.064
So the Divine will look after that part.

36:12.224 --> 36:17.400
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

36:17.560 --> 36:20.135
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

36:20.295 --> 36:24.473
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

36:24.633 --> 36:27.314
their love – everything She enjoys.

36:27.474 --> 36:30.751
In the same way you have to enjoy.

36:31.970 --> 36:34.570
You have to know about everything,

36:34.730 --> 36:38.636
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

36:41.510 --> 36:46.390
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

36:46.550 --> 36:50.270
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

36:50.430 --> 36:52.878
At the most!

36:53.038 --> 36:56.750
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.030
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

36:59.190 --> 37:03.702
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

37:03.862 --> 37:05.390
And you are on the stage,

37:05.550 --> 37:07.710
so they are looking out what to focus light,

37:07.870 --> 37:10.470
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

37:10.630 --> 37:11.870
what is to be changed around.

37:12.030 --> 37:16.815
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

37:16.975 --> 37:19.255
So you need not do all that work.

37:19.415 --> 37:24.574
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

37:24.734 --> 37:29.351
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

37:29.511 --> 37:36.551
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

37:37.423 --> 37:40.757
So to leave certain things into the hands

37:40.917 --> 37:46.099
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

37:46.750 --> 37:51.694
And that much of this, if done, then

37:52.022 --> 37:55.860
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

37:56.020 --> 38:00.710
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

38:00.870 --> 38:06.166
We never expected how things we got it done?”

38:06.326 --> 38:08.686
There’s a very, very big force working:

38:08.846 --> 38:12.310
the Force, the Energy

38:12.470 --> 38:15.527
which is the Source of all the energies,

38:15.687 --> 38:18.624
which has created this great universe,

38:18.784 --> 38:22.064
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

38:22.304 --> 38:26.120
which has created you very delicately.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.920
This Force is working.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.480
And that Force is looking after you,

38:31.640 --> 38:37.159
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

38:40.934 --> 38:45.751
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

38:45.911 --> 38:50.251
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.640
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

38:52.800 --> 38:56.400
give us Your lion so we fight.”

38:56.560 --> 39:00.790
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

39:00.950 --> 39:04.774
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

39:04.934 --> 39:07.303
these horrible conditionings we have.

39:07.463 --> 39:10.526
You have to get rid of it.

39:10.686 --> 39:14.863
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

39:15.023 --> 39:18.440
lots of things, you see. If you see,

39:18.600 --> 39:23.686
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

39:23.880 --> 39:26.494
but they are there.

39:26.654 --> 39:31.406
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

39:31.566 --> 39:34.197
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

39:34.357 --> 39:40.477
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

39:41.095 --> 39:44.143
– like a Goddess. Why not?

39:44.303 --> 39:49.760
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

39:49.934 --> 39:53.120
So you have all the heritage available to you.

39:53.280 --> 39:57.159
But you have to be worthy,

39:57.319 --> 40:01.877
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

40:02.037 --> 40:05.490
You have to just know that you are worthy

40:05.650 --> 40:08.130
and that you can do it.

40:09.098 --> 40:14.492
So again today we are here to do this puja,

40:15.130 --> 40:20.163
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

40:20.323 --> 40:24.715
and is luck for you to have this puja.

40:24.875 --> 40:30.426
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

40:30.586 --> 40:34.609
very subtler nature.

40:36.143 --> 40:39.930
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

40:40.090 --> 40:43.373
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

40:43.533 --> 40:45.810
because it’s blood.

40:45.970 --> 40:50.969
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

40:51.129 --> 40:56.083
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

40:56.243 --> 40:59.178
another side it is the security.

40:59.338 --> 41:03.698
So for you it is the security around you.

41:03.858 --> 41:09.733
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

41:10.130 --> 41:15.046
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

41:15.206 --> 41:18.482
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

41:18.642 --> 41:21.111
so beautifully you are settled down.

41:21.290 --> 41:24.984
May God bless you.
