WEBVTT

00:01.709 --> 00:13.130
is spiritual evolution of man.

00:13.130 --> 00:20.689
In my last three lectures, I’ve already
explained about the residual force called

00:20.689 --> 00:27.970
as Kundalini that resides in the triangular
bone here.

00:27.970 --> 00:49.519
This residual force gives us the second birth.

00:49.519 --> 00:53.930
But how did we become human beings?

00:53.930 --> 01:00.950
Though known to us, we do not know why we
became human beings.

01:00.950 --> 01:16.530
All the scientists must ask this question,
“Why did we become human beings?

01:16.530 --> 01:27.860
Is there
any meaning to this human life?

01:27.860 --> 01:46.490
Or are we born just to eat our food, produce
children, keep money for them, and then die?”

01:46.490 --> 01:51.770
If you make any instrument – for example,
this instrument [microphone] – you always

01:51.770 --> 01:54.750
have a purpose behind it.

01:54.750 --> 02:08.289
I’ve read a very good book by a gentleman,
who was a French gentleman, whose name was

02:08.289 --> 02:13.520
[UNCLEAR Dunoire] – maybe I am not good
at pronunciation – who wrote that, “It

02:13.520 --> 02:43.480
is impossible to produce a human being in
this short time since the Earth seceded from

02:43.480 --> 02:48.290
the Sun."

02:48.290 --> 02:57.280
That means if you use the law of chance, you
cannot explain this fast movement of development

02:57.280 --> 03:34.280
of a small carbon atom into a human being
in such a short time.

03:34.280 --> 03:44.340
According to him, there must be a juggler
behind it to do this.

03:44.340 --> 03:51.170
As I’ve told you before that this I put
forward before you as a hypothesis and you

03:51.170 --> 03:57.540
must keep your mind open as any scientific
personality does.

03:57.540 --> 04:14.120
If it comes true, then you have to believe
into it.

04:14.120 --> 04:23.659
Yesterday I talked about the all-pervading
power which is

04:23.659 --> 04:28.470
the Truth.

04:28.470 --> 04:41.780
Yesterday those who were here got their realization
and they felt the power flowing from their

04:41.780 --> 04:49.030
hands, clearly.

04:49.030 --> 04:55.330
And they felt absolutely blissful.

04:55.330 --> 05:02.680
They also saw small children checking them,
their vibrations.

05:02.680 --> 05:17.280
So it is true that man has not yet discovered
his meaning, so he has to become connected

05:17.280 --> 05:31.680
with the mains as any instrument has to.

05:31.680 --> 05:39.490
This is what is the spiritual evolution of
man.

05:39.490 --> 05:50.139
When a human consciousness gets enlightened
or there is a breakthrough into the unconscious

05:50.139 --> 05:52.710
then only we can say that we have evolved
fully.

05:52.710 --> 05:59.440
We can understand human evolution on the same
way as we have the instruments set for spacecrafts.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.240
In one spacecraft, an instrument is placed
first, the lowest capsule, which explodes

06:04.240 --> 06:10.530
and accelerates the rate of the second capsule.

06:10.530 --> 06:23.200
One lower end capsule, and then there’s
another one, and there’s another one and

06:23.200 --> 06:50.759
this one has the spacecraft in it.

06:50.759 --> 07:07.530
So if this moves with the velocity of three,
the explosion in this one (lower capsule)

07:07.530 --> 08:13.270
makes it three raise to the power, say, ten
and this one makes it three raise to power,

08:13.270 --> 08:14.870
say, 20.

08:14.870 --> 08:18.870
It goes on like that.

08:18.870 --> 08:25.810
So the acceleration is very fast.

08:25.810 --> 08:29.520
So ultimately this is thrown and triggered
into the space.

08:29.520 --> 08:40.980
This all comes as a bundle, to begin with.

08:40.980 --> 08:52.250
In the same way, a human being is, first of
all, exploded into his physical.

08:52.250 --> 09:16.330
The physical expresses into his mental being,
then into his emotional being, then into his

09:16.330 --> 09:20.520
spiritual being.

09:20.520 --> 09:31.390
And then he should stop into his Spirit.

09:31.390 --> 09:42.320
That is the space of the all-pervading power.

09:42.320 --> 09:55.900
In us exist all the physical, mental,emotional
and spiritual beings.

09:55.900 --> 10:23.820
Today, as the time is, man is so matured that
he is more spiritual than physical.

10:23.820 --> 10:32.490
But the matter is so much attached to the
Spirit, that it is difficult for him to understand

10:32.490 --> 11:06.740
that the gap between the matter, the spiritual
and the physical and other things

11:06.740 --> 11:13.890
is not so much binding.

11:13.890 --> 11:26.160
For example, all the affluent countries have
a problem of suicide

11:26.160 --> 11:33.660
and the suicide is much more, the more you
are affluent.

11:33.660 --> 11:42.220
I had some young girls from Sweden who came
from Cambridge University, hardly about 20

11:42.220 --> 11:55.880
years of age.

11:55.880 --> 12:04.890
And when I saw their vibrations I was amazed;
they were numb, just like a dead person’s

12:04.890 --> 12:07.720
vibrations.

12:07.720 --> 12:30.580
Otherwise, they were alright, they were children
of rich people educating themselves.

12:30.580 --> 12:33.240
So I asked them what do you think all the
time?

12:33.240 --> 12:35.080
What do you plan?

12:35.080 --> 12:42.120
They told me, to my amazement, that they are
planning how to commit suicide.

12:42.120 --> 13:01.650
I was
so surprised and so hurt and unhappy and pained.

13:01.650 --> 13:12.390
With what care God has created them from amoeba
to this stage and they are here to destroy

13:12.390 --> 13:25.130
themselves?

13:25.130 --> 13:27.750
I asked them what do you want?

13:27.750 --> 13:29.850
Do you want money?

13:29.850 --> 13:37.630
Do you want love?

13:37.630 --> 13:40.990
What do you want?

13:40.990 --> 13:46.190
And I called them to my house and made them
sit down and I talked to them.

13:46.190 --> 14:02.980
I felt that they didn’t know what they wanted.

14:02.980 --> 14:12.730
But they said that we are very unhappy in
life, as if there is some gap between us and

14:12.730 --> 14:15.220
ourselves.

14:15.220 --> 14:29.230
Perhaps we do not know what is our significance
in this life.

14:29.230 --> 14:41.970
Then I told them that you can find your significance
and why should you be that desperate?

14:41.970 --> 14:52.550
The God Almighty who has made you with this
care, with this consistently working on you

14:52.550 --> 14:57.450
for ages, has made you a human being.

14:57.450 --> 15:14.220
He must have made some arrangement for you
to find your own significance.

15:14.220 --> 15:21.220
And He has made all the arrangements, as we
make for an instrument to have a cord to be

15:21.220 --> 15:23.120
attached to the mains.

15:23.120 --> 15:40.610
That is
this Kundalini which is placed here.

15:40.610 --> 15:46.660
Thousands of years back in India, people had
discovered the existence of Kundalini.

15:46.660 --> 16:02.470
Search in the West started, after Rousseau,
into outside.

16:02.470 --> 16:09.760
But they could not enter inside.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.840
They thought it is better to search outside.

16:12.840 --> 16:20.820
Because they could not enter inside, they
thought it was better to search outside.

16:20.820 --> 16:33.780
But as you were searching outside, there was
a search inside going on, too.

16:33.780 --> 16:49.400
In that search they discovered this Kundalini
being the source of our breakthrough.

16:49.400 --> 16:58.710
We have evolved through a force that exists
within us on this center called as the Nabhi

16:58.710 --> 17:14.500
center or the Navel center.

17:14.500 --> 17:37.509
By giving us sustenance, by giving us our
quality, our nature, or our natural religion

17:37.509 --> 17:43.470
that we were made into a human being.

17:43.470 --> 17:54.299
If you see in a chemical periodic law, you
will be amazed how all these elements are

17:54.299 --> 18:10.679
arranged such a way, in a big beautiful chart,
and how the carbon atom, when it came into

18:10.679 --> 18:21.460
existence, we started becoming alive.

18:21.460 --> 18:32.720
That carbon atom is placed within us here.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.410
Here is the innocence of the matter.

18:34.410 --> 18:39.299
Matter is innocent.

18:39.299 --> 18:50.830
Up to the animal stage we are absolutely innocent.

18:50.830 --> 18:56.360
Even human children are innocent, mostly.

18:56.360 --> 19:10.139
But we lose our innocence when we start using
these two powers, one of desiring and another

19:10.139 --> 19:11.909
of action.

19:11.909 --> 19:22.850
We create the ego and superego by which we’ve
become a human being.

19:22.850 --> 19:31.140
That’s how you become your Self.

19:31.140 --> 19:35.720
That means you become independent.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.929
You have all freedom to behave as you like.

19:38.929 --> 19:54.440
In that freedom only, you grasp the idea of
the beyond.

19:54.440 --> 20:02.159
These ideas come to you through your dreams.

20:02.159 --> 20:10.659
Most of the paintings and the great arts are
produced through the understanding of the

20:10.659 --> 20:15.299
unconscious.

20:15.299 --> 20:31.499
Our unconscious guides it all the time to
warn us about our evolution.

20:31.499 --> 20:40.290
Jung has described it very clearly.

20:40.290 --> 20:46.279
He has experimented with thousands of people
of different parts of the world.

20:46.279 --> 20:55.869
He says this unconscious gives the balance,
the coordination, the future guidance through

20:55.869 --> 21:15.850
your dreams.

21:15.850 --> 21:23.840
That means our guidance has been there, we
have a desire and we have an idea that there

21:23.840 --> 21:30.399
is something beyond.

21:30.399 --> 21:46.539
That means that we have a desire that we have
to rise and that there is something beyond.

21:46.539 --> 21:53.570
And also there is guidance coming from the
unconscious.

21:53.570 --> 22:06.409
But there is another guidance which has come
to us from God.

22:06.409 --> 22:13.909
This is very much believed into in India.

22:13.909 --> 22:24.110
Even in the Western world, if they follow
Christianity or Judaism, they believe it.

22:24.110 --> 22:39.169
It is believed that at that spot resides the
power of God which evolves.

22:39.169 --> 23:02.580
This area according to Indian mythology is
governed by a power called Lakshmi, which

23:02.580 --> 23:17.860
on one side gives us our sustenance and on
the other side guides us how to behave.

23:17.860 --> 23:26.429
And from the same power, the male form of
that power incarnates, again and again, to

23:26.429 --> 23:35.100
guide the people, in human form.

23:35.100 --> 23:59.399
This incarnation, in the beginning, was a
fish when we were fishes; when we were tortoises,

23:59.399 --> 24:04.809
it was a tortoise; when we were reptiles,
it was a tortoise; when we were quadrupeds,

24:04.809 --> 24:10.539
it was a boar.

24:10.539 --> 24:27.100
Then, later on, it became half man and half
lion.

24:27.100 --> 24:37.559
Then it became a small man, a short man.

24:37.559 --> 24:46.330
Then it became the very strong man – Parashurama.

24:46.330 --> 24:52.149
Then he came as Shri Rama.

24:52.149 --> 25:03.659
At his completion, he came as Shri Krishna.

25:03.659 --> 25:21.139
Now this center which has got the innocence,
the incarnation of the innocence, the embodiment

25:21.139 --> 25:36.419
of innocence, was Shri Ganesh.

25:36.419 --> 25:50.049
This Shri Ganesh incarnated on this Earth
as the only Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ.

25:50.049 --> 26:05.510
And He is going to reincarnate again with
eleven powers to destroy.

26:05.510 --> 26:20.480
Apart from that, there is a third type of
incarnation which works in this gap to sustain

26:20.480 --> 26:21.480
us.

26:21.480 --> 26:31.289
These are ten Primordial Masters, the Adi
Gurus.

26:31.289 --> 26:46.110
These people incarnated on this Earth to give
us our sustenance, our religion, as they call

26:46.110 --> 26:47.649
it.

26:47.649 --> 27:03.679
They gave us those ten religions, or sustenance,
which is important for a human being.

27:03.679 --> 27:13.539
This principle of primordial masters incarnated
as Abraham, as Moses, as Mohammad Sahab, as

27:13.539 --> 27:23.779
Janaka, as Nanaka, as Socrates and, till recently,
the one who is no more now, is Shirdi Sainath.

27:23.779 --> 27:53.330
Now, these people are incarnations of one
principle, that is

27:53.330 --> 28:02.690
the Primordial Master.

28:02.690 --> 28:10.269
The energy, or the power with which they work,
is either a sister or a daughter, is a very

28:10.269 --> 28:14.239
pure relationship.

28:14.239 --> 28:34.940
If you read their teachings, you will find
they are saying the same things because they

28:34.940 --> 28:42.499
were worried about our sustenance.

28:42.499 --> 28:51.659
But Christ talked about our evolution, our
resurrection.

28:51.659 --> 29:02.519
Krishna, in his incarnation, said that divine
life cannot be destroyed.

29:02.519 --> 29:22.429
The life of Christ, or the body of Christ,
was made of this divine power, absolute.

29:22.429 --> 29:38.299
In one of the very old scriptures, Devi Bhagawat
from India, Christ is described as Mahavishnu.

29:38.299 --> 29:54.850
He is described as first being an egg; that’s
why on an Easter we give eggs.

29:54.850 --> 29:59.789
But Christians can’t explain why they give
eggs.

29:59.789 --> 30:07.350
They also cannot explain why he was called
Christ and Jesus.

30:07.350 --> 30:19.100
When He talks of His father, it is Krishna
He is talking about.

30:19.100 --> 30:29.240
It is said in the Devi Bhagawat, Krishna put
His Son even above Him.

30:29.240 --> 30:42.710
And He gave Him such powers that He would
be the support of the whole universe.

30:42.710 --> 30:52.309
As an Indian, if you have read about Indian
mythology, you will have much more respect

30:52.309 --> 31:08.970
for Christ and His Mother, who was nothing
else but the Primordial Mother.

31:08.970 --> 31:16.809
Because India was a slave for 300 years and
English became the main language, nobody tried

31:16.809 --> 31:23.340
to translate anything about Indian things.

31:23.340 --> 31:44.850
Moreover, the Western people were more interested
in sexology and all dirty things of India.

31:44.850 --> 32:01.749
It is like entering into a house from the
gutters of the backdoor.

32:01.749 --> 32:11.570
Even now the way they are interested in all
these dirty things is most amazing for Indians.

32:11.570 --> 32:27.129
We went to Nepal with my husband and children
and we never noticed any erotic things.

32:27.129 --> 32:32.720
But I had a Swiss disciple in Nepal.

32:32.720 --> 32:53.070
When I went again to Nepal, he told me that
it was full of erotics at the top of the temples.

32:53.070 --> 32:58.830
And all the Japanese and all such people were
busy with zoom lenses watching all that with

32:58.830 --> 32:59.889
such minute details.

32:59.889 --> 33:09.070
I didn’t know what was there to watch.

33:09.070 --> 33:27.080
It is difficult to understand this mind which
takes you to these nonsensical things.

33:27.080 --> 33:33.639
If you have to evaluate a person, you must
know how far spiritually he has gone and not

33:33.639 --> 33:47.989
how much he has debased himself, not by that.

33:47.989 --> 33:53.220
How much he has mastered his lust and greed
is to be seen and not how much he has enslaved

33:53.220 --> 34:06.909
himself of these things.

34:06.909 --> 34:21.589
If a person wants comfort and cannot live
without comfort, he is not a spiritual man.

34:21.589 --> 34:25.460
He can live in comfort or discomfort, it makes
no difference to him because he lives with

34:25.460 --> 34:36.220
his Spirit.

34:36.220 --> 34:45.289
Such a person is a king; nothing can dominate
such a person, nobody can capture such a person

34:45.289 --> 34:52.889
or can make a parasite out of him.

34:52.889 --> 34:59.390
If one understands that spiritual life gives
you the mastery of your being, then you would

34:59.390 --> 35:15.650
understand that those people who roam about
as gurus are just parasites.

35:15.650 --> 35:35.410
Now, these incarnations who came on this Earth
were manifesting the different aspects of

35:35.410 --> 35:41.920
God.

35:41.920 --> 35:53.430
Because God is Compassion, He is Love, He
is your Father and He is Almighty.

35:53.430 --> 36:03.150
He wants to bestow all His blessings upon
you and He wants to enlighten your awareness.

36:03.150 --> 36:21.190
For that He sends His own emissaries
to guide you, to rise above the shackles of

36:21.190 --> 36:32.930
matter, the mind, the emotions and spiritual
mistakes.

36:32.930 --> 36:48.930
For that, God has already placed a power there.

36:48.930 --> 36:57.119
Many people have talked about this and have
written big books of this kind.

36:57.119 --> 37:07.369
By reading books you cannot get the awakening
of this Kundalini.

37:07.369 --> 37:18.480
It is a germinating force within us.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.859
It is a living force.

37:19.859 --> 37:26.250
You cannot germinate a seed by reading books.

37:26.250 --> 37:29.310
You have to have the Mother Earth to germinate.

37:29.310 --> 37:37.850
In the same way, to raise this Kundalini,
you need a person who is the mother of this

37:37.850 --> 38:00.240
Kundalini, or who is the master of this art,
who is compassion, who is Love, who is holy,

38:00.240 --> 38:07.190
who is righteous.

38:07.190 --> 38:16.670
But not a person who leads a funny life, a
guru having seven women around, cannot be

38:16.670 --> 38:20.170
a master of Kundalini.

38:20.170 --> 38:32.799
A man who takes money from you cannot raise
your Kundalini.

38:32.799 --> 38:39.539
A man who takes money from you has no self-respect.

38:39.539 --> 38:45.349
He cannot even talk of Kundalini.

38:45.349 --> 38:51.470
Such a person has to be higher than you.

38:51.470 --> 38:56.310
In that, he is humbler than you.

38:56.310 --> 39:10.869
He is full of love and patience and understanding;
not of your purse, but of your beauty; not

39:10.869 --> 39:17.730
of your bank balance and your position, but
your position within.

39:17.730 --> 39:34.780
If you find somebody coming with a circus,
why should you be impressed by such a man?

39:34.780 --> 39:40.890
All important things, all vital things are
extremely simple.

39:40.890 --> 39:47.869
For example your own breathing.

39:47.869 --> 39:53.430
Supposing for your breathing if you have to
read books and analyze it, will you breathe?

39:53.430 --> 40:03.740
For that, you don’t have to read any books.

40:03.740 --> 40:07.729
It is spontaneous.

40:07.729 --> 40:13.520
All your evolution has been spontaneous.

40:13.520 --> 40:24.070
You got your body, face, nose, eyes, this
human being, all for nothing.

40:24.070 --> 40:30.900
What did you do to get that?

40:30.900 --> 40:41.210
Its all given as a blessing to you because
God wants his children to get all his blessings

40:41.210 --> 40:42.970
and all his powers.

40:42.970 --> 40:55.440
But in his freedom, man has become so egoistical
that he is also denying God.

40:55.440 --> 41:19.349
It’s alright, it’s just the same as blind
faith, just the same as denial of God.

41:19.349 --> 41:28.859
Even the people who believe in God, so-called,
what have they achieved?

41:28.859 --> 41:35.890
That is the reason why people now are going
to the other extreme of denying God.

41:35.890 --> 41:47.420
For example, Algeria, where the people have
been under French regime and who believed

41:47.420 --> 42:03.839
in God and everything, but the young people
became communists.

42:03.839 --> 42:08.630
Because the young people do not believe in
the old people who are blindly following some

42:08.630 --> 42:12.230
sort of an organization of God.

42:12.230 --> 42:34.359
Because they are so mythical; they have no
proof of God and they are so fanatic.

42:34.359 --> 42:37.670
Fanaticism is a disease.

42:37.670 --> 42:43.690
It has nothing to do with God.

42:43.690 --> 42:51.359
That’s one extreme and another extreme is
denial of God.

42:51.359 --> 43:01.950
When you are in the center you can find God.

43:01.950 --> 43:17.970
A boy from Algeria came and he got his realization
in London with me.

43:17.970 --> 43:24.240
He went and told the young people in Algeria
that, “No, there is God, but we have to

43:24.240 --> 43:34.559
find him within ourselves."

43:34.559 --> 43:38.859
He gave realization to five hundred young
boys.

43:38.859 --> 43:50.860
With self-realization, your life is completely
transformed.

43:50.860 --> 44:02.190
We have here about fifty-percent of people
are realized souls.

44:02.190 --> 44:07.829
After realization, the power starts flowing
from your hands.

44:07.829 --> 44:23.829
This is the power of your Spirit and you can
use it and verify it.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.819
The diseases like cancer cannot be cured without
self-realization.

44:26.819 --> 44:39.849
We
have cured many cancer patients.

44:39.849 --> 44:49.940
I have even cured the President of India of
lung cancer.

44:49.940 --> 44:53.900
You may write to him and find out.

44:53.900 --> 45:08.000
But it is very easy to approach a President
in India if you’re a saint.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.789
They respect you as a saint.

45:12.789 --> 45:19.160
For example, the President of India would
stand up for me, though I am an Indian citizen.

45:19.160 --> 45:34.410
And he would not sit down till I have sat
down.

45:34.410 --> 45:41.319
But in the West, people do not stand even
for their own father.

45:41.319 --> 46:00.369
The ego makes a person so naive about spirituality
and anybody who comes to pamper your ego,

46:00.369 --> 46:02.130
you accept it.

46:02.130 --> 46:11.450
[Shri Mataji speaks to a seeker]: Are you
taping my lecture?

46:11.450 --> 46:14.450
That’s not allowed?

46:14.450 --> 46:16.440
It’s alright?

46:16.440 --> 46:19.560
… The organization, they say it should not
be taped, but it’s alright, because it has

46:19.560 --> 46:31.850
a little problem.

46:31.850 --> 46:45.530
There is a protocol about this.

46:45.530 --> 46:53.990
Only thing is for realized souls we allow,
but not to non-realized souls because if you

46:53.990 --> 47:04.200
insult it, it will have an effect on you.

47:04.200 --> 47:31.059
Otherwise there is no harm in recording me.

47:31.059 --> 47:43.280
There is no enterprise going on here, but
there is a protocol.

47:43.280 --> 47:58.549
It’s alright, you can tape it because, for
example, my photograph has vibrations.

47:58.549 --> 48:06.650
If you put my photograph somewhere else it
is not alright, then you fall from the grace.

48:06.650 --> 48:11.650
It should not be done.

48:11.650 --> 48:26.529
You understand my point?

48:26.529 --> 48:33.640
Because it is a holy thing.

48:33.640 --> 48:50.799
Cancer and other such diseases can be cured
through self-realization as a by-product

48:50.799 --> 48:55.490
but it is not the main job of Sahaja Yoga.

48:55.490 --> 49:03.190
It is just a by-product.

49:03.190 --> 49:07.410
Like when God has to be realized within you,
is to be established in your temple.

49:07.410 --> 49:18.630
Your temple has to be cleansed.

49:18.630 --> 49:43.119
If you do not get your realization, then there
is no need to worry about it.

49:43.119 --> 49:50.609
You will get it, eventually and you must get
it.

49:50.609 --> 49:58.220
This is your right to have it and you must
assert your right.

49:58.220 --> 50:01.840
You cannot live without it.

50:01.840 --> 50:08.130
If you won’t take in this life, you will
be born again and ask for the same.

50:08.130 --> 50:12.780
Why not short-circuit it?

50:12.780 --> 50:28.230
I said it is the easiest thing to do but very
difficult for human beings to be easy.

50:28.230 --> 50:38.460
They can eat their food like this, but they
want to eat the other way round.

50:38.460 --> 50:50.460
It is like a
second birth of a bird.

50:50.460 --> 51:03.390
You become like an egg by that covering
and when Kundalini pierces through, She breaks

51:03.390 --> 51:14.930
the shell here
and you become a new person with a new awareness

51:14.930 --> 51:21.670
of collective consciousness.

51:21.670 --> 51:23.039
You become, you actualize.

51:23.039 --> 51:30.260
It is not just brainwashing.

51:30.260 --> 51:33.900
You just can feel it.

51:33.900 --> 51:44.170
But even if you are born as a human being
and again you will live with wolves, you may

51:44.170 --> 51:47.950
behave like wolves.

51:47.950 --> 51:56.180
Because you must mature like human beings
to begin with.

51:56.180 --> 52:02.010
In the same way, you have to mature like a
self-realized person.

52:02.010 --> 52:16.220
Like a seed can germinate but it has to be
looked after till it completely becomes an

52:16.220 --> 52:21.180
independent tree.

52:21.180 --> 52:30.619
This is your own power within you.

52:30.619 --> 52:44.710
She is your mother and she has no other child;
she knows everything about you; she loves

52:44.710 --> 52:53.210
you and she wants you to have your self-realization.

52:53.210 --> 52:56.460
She is not going to give you any trouble.

52:56.460 --> 53:06.589
At the time of your birth, she takes all the
troubles herself.

53:06.589 --> 53:13.630
It is a very smooth affair.

53:13.630 --> 53:24.680
At the first outset, it rushes very fast up
there and you became one with the all-pervading

53:24.680 --> 53:32.700
power.

53:32.700 --> 53:39.100
You start feeling your own centers and the
centers of others.

53:39.100 --> 53:40.990
I have shown here.

53:40.990 --> 53:45.870
All your centers are enlightened – seven
of them.

53:45.870 --> 53:54.579
For example, this is the center of Heart.

53:54.579 --> 53:59.510
If you place your hands towards me like this
and if you find this one burning (pointing

53:59.510 --> 54:04.170
to her little finger), that means there is
some pressure on your heart.

54:04.170 --> 54:20.720
Like that, one can diagnose any disease that
you are suffering from.

54:20.720 --> 54:28.030
All these decodings could be done through
Sahaja Yoga.

54:28.030 --> 54:35.300
All this knowledge is available free.

54:35.300 --> 54:50.200
So that you enjoy your self thoroughly and
you feel yourself and others, give realization

54:50.200 --> 54:59.529
to others and enjoy the being.

54:59.529 --> 55:07.789
First time the human beings enjoy other human
beings as if the fragrance from the flower

55:07.789 --> 55:17.099
is enjoying the flower.

55:17.099 --> 55:26.319
First time after realization, you can repay
back

55:26.319 --> 55:29.319
the nature which you have used.

55:29.319 --> 55:40.339
For example, if you give your vibrations to
a tree, which is sick, it will improve, it

55:40.339 --> 55:44.920
will give more fruits, much more fruits.

55:44.920 --> 55:55.210
If you give vibrations to your wheat fields
and paddy fields, you will have plenty of

55:55.210 --> 55:59.410
foods.

55:59.410 --> 56:04.490
You can even vibrate this water and give it
to somebody and the person will feel perfectly

56:04.490 --> 56:11.829
alright in his stomach.

56:11.829 --> 56:26.240
When you become subtle, you can enter into
the subtle of the elements.

56:26.240 --> 56:32.910
By entering into the subtle you can use them
for your own purpose.

56:32.910 --> 56:41.980
Moreover, when you are in connection with
the all-pervading power, there is a complete

56:41.980 --> 56:54.190
telecommunication working.

56:54.190 --> 57:00.549
Sitting here, you can know what is the matter
with another person who is thousands of miles

57:00.549 --> 57:07.000
away from you.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.410
You can also cure that person.

57:09.410 --> 57:20.910
These children can find out if a particular
person, who is dead or living, is realized

57:20.910 --> 57:23.279
or not?

57:23.279 --> 57:31.950
For example in England, there is a place called
Stonehenge and the people have different theories

57:31.950 --> 57:34.850
about it.

57:34.850 --> 57:46.829
Like blind finding something and they are
quarreling about it.

57:46.829 --> 58:00.240
Stonehenge is a miracle of the Mother Earth;
it is Mother Earth who has created those stones.

58:00.240 --> 58:13.220
They have a particular pattern by which they
emit vibrations.

58:13.220 --> 58:23.750
These vibrations are there to save London
from getting drowned into materialism.

58:23.750 --> 58:28.009
The poor Mother Earth has to do all these
things.

58:28.009 --> 58:36.579
In the Ten Commandments, it is said that you
shall not reproduce anything that is created

58:36.579 --> 58:56.490
by the Mother Earth or by the sky and worship
it.

58:56.490 --> 59:00.640
What is produced by the Mother Earth?

59:00.640 --> 59:04.059
These things which give you vibrations.

59:04.059 --> 59:10.900
In India, we have many places like these.

59:10.900 --> 59:16.870
And we have so many saints who have found
them out.

59:16.870 --> 59:29.510
The province from where I come there are eight
which represent the innocence.

59:29.510 --> 59:35.309
The stones that have come up are not touched
by human beings but they look exactly like

59:35.309 --> 59:36.480
Shri Ganesh.

59:36.480 --> 59:45.240
There are 12 Jyotirlingas which represent
the heart, the Spirit.

59:45.240 --> 01:00:00.180
In Amarnath, in the Himalayas, there is a
place in a cave where the water falls down

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:09.269
and at a particular time, lunar date, the
thing becomes a complete linga.

01:00:09.269 --> 01:00:29.740
In the Himalayas, one of the ranges of Himalayas,
beyond the Kulu Valley, in the temple of Amarnath,

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.950
there is a drop coming from the ceiling of
a cave.

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.500
It forms a complete Linga.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:58.309
At that date, it is completed and it gives
vibrations.

01:00:58.309 --> 01:01:10.960
We have a center in a place known as Musselwadi
in India.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:23.490
They told me a story about a bund that was
built across

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:27.940
a lake.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:40.890
Bund should be straight, but at a point, it
went like that and again like that with a

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:44.040
circular movement.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.980
I asked them what is the reason?

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:53.630
So they told me, about a hundred years back,
an English engineer had come to build this

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:54.960
barrage.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:14.579
This, he wrote, was a
very unique phenomenon.

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:19.609
He said that he tried to build a wall on that
part but he could not raise it.

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:32.950
Every night it used to fall back.

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:42.700
Even the horses would refuse to go near that
to put the mud over that.

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:56.190
And he could not understand it, so he had
to cross that point in a circular way.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:57.609
I went and saw that place.

01:02:57.609 --> 01:03:09.190
It was all vibrating and giving the vibrations
as they would come from this center called

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:12.029
as Sahasrara.

01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:18.529
The whole atmosphere was filled with that.

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:28.050
Once I went to Kashmir with my husband and
I had gone just for a drive with him a little

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:38.660
further away from the city.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:44.730
And I felt tremendous vibrations in that area
and I asked the driver if there was any temple

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:47.369
or anything here?

01:03:47.369 --> 01:04:01.700
He said that it is all wilderness so I asked
him to go in the direction from where the

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:13.270
vibrations were coming.

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:27.010
When we reached a particular area, we found
some Muslim houses were settled there.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:39.960
They told us that there is one hair of Mohammad
Sahab kept in that mosque, known as Hazrat

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960
Ekbal.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.250
(Ekbal means one hair.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:48.249
Hazrat means respect.)

01:04:48.249 --> 01:05:04.700
But for that hair, these useless people there
fought among themselves and killed each other.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:09.460
Such shameless people they are.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:15.789
They do not understand the protocol of that
hair.

01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:20.240
They don’t understand the vibrations.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:28.749
For example in Paris, the statue of Mary in
Notre Dame is extremely vibrating.

01:05:28.749 --> 01:05:35.869
Imagine, a man committed suicide from such
a beautiful holy place.

01:05:35.869 --> 01:05:42.390
What a shame.

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:46.420
It is an insult of the deities.

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.730
How will he understand?

01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:51.559
Because he is not a realized soul.

01:05:51.559 --> 01:05:58.830
That is why they crucified Christ.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:04.589
They could not understand him and they did
not want to understand.

01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:12.630
Today I am faced with intellectuals.

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:16.430
Intellectuals move like this, come like this,
go like this, come like this, go like this,

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:21.760
come like this – finished.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:27.640
They are a little bit this way.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.749
The other day one man told me that Hitler
was also God.

01:06:31.749 --> 01:06:43.549
I asked him, ”Who told you that?”

01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:46.660
He said that I believe that way.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:52.609
I asked him, ”Who is this I who believes
and on what premises?”

01:06:52.609 --> 01:07:01.869
He could not answer that question.

01:07:01.869 --> 01:07:10.890
If you can feel the vibrations of that horrid
Hitler you would know who he was.

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:14.190
He was a demon.

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:24.809
He not only destroyed people but he destroyed
all

01:07:24.809 --> 01:07:27.840
the values of sustenance.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.630
He disturbed the sense of security so much
in human beings that today we find all these

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:46.440
kinds of problems in the West.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.440
How can you call a demon a God?

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.579
From what intellectual angle?

01:07:52.579 --> 01:08:04.430
I do not know how one can see upside down
things with your intellect?

01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:15.430
There is another guru in India who is teaching
people how to use sex to go to God.

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:24.670
Have you forgotten Christ?

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:31.139
He said, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,”
was the commandment, but I say, “Thou shalt

01:08:31.139 --> 01:08:49.250
not have adulterous eyes,” because the eyes
are possessed when you do that.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:59.330
It’s a joyless effort, so tiring and so
boring.

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:03.710
It has no meaning.

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:09.150
It fritters away your energy completely.

01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:20.080
When will you enjoy yourself with all the
beauty of Paris?

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.070
I find people just going like this.

01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:36.170
They have no time to enjoy beauty.

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:45.339
They have no sensitivity to suck that beauty.

01:09:45.339 --> 01:09:59.179
[UNCLEAR] But because of these atmospheres
and these great people writing books, you

01:09:59.179 --> 01:10:10.170
are lost in the opinion of others.

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:13.690
You are not to be found.

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:19.420
What you say is somebody else’s opinion.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:25.139
You have known your own experience.

01:10:25.139 --> 01:10:31.940
Why should you listen to anybody else?

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.440
Form your own opinion.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:39.070
But where are you?

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:41.640
You are lost in the crowd.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:49.030
That’s why get your realization.

01:10:49.030 --> 01:11:04.250
That is your absolute and by that absolute
you will know that this is all relative.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:12.020
Then only you will get answers to all your
absolute questions.

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:22.440
With this Yoga, with this communion, you become
one with that Truth.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:46.800
It’s like a connection of a very beautifully
built computer.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:12:02.760
Now this computer is very nicely made in thousands
of years and a rapport is established that

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.270
you can ask any question.

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:11.800
You can ask the question, “Is there God?”

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.330
T this question you will start getting lots
of vibrations.

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:37.300
But there are another type of things which
are also called by negative people as vibrations.

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:41.130
One should not confuse.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:47.270
If you get possessed, also, you start shaking.

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:52.400
You’ll get convulsions.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.050
People pay thousands of pounds to get convulsions.

01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:04.870
We had here some people from TM, some from
others, Rajneesh and this and that.

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:18.739
They all have paid thousands of rupees just
to get convulsions.

01:13:18.739 --> 01:13:28.820
Some of them were lunatics and some of them
were epileptics.

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:38.410
So many people like this are dying on the
streets with epilepsy.

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:45.340
You must know if you have got your own powers.

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:58.190
If you are manifesting your own power, if
you can feel your own chakras (centers), that’s

01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:08.840
your Self, and you must feel the chakras of
others.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:21.270
You must improve in your health, in your wealth
and in your temperament.

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:34.920
The complete priorities must change and you
should be a transformed personality.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:53.550
Otherwise people pay them for convulsions
or for epilepsy, or for getting sick and headaches?

01:14:53.550 --> 01:15:04.610
Most of these people have a terrible headache
here, ending up in lunatic asylum.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:08.800
But they’re not telling each other because
some mafia is going on; nobody knows what

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:16.800
is going wrong with the others.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.630
You are told to keep complete secret.

01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:38.140
So that you do not know how far you are rottened
and a competition is set in secretly.

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:44.260
Some people are saying they are teaching flying.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:49.750
How can you believe with your intelligence
such nonsense?

01:15:49.750 --> 01:16:00.409
With your evolution are you going to be become
birds now and then frogs?

01:16:00.409 --> 01:16:14.179
You have to become something else which is
described in all the scriptures, supported

01:16:14.179 --> 01:16:20.360
by all the incarnations and the prophets.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.370
Imagine, some people started flying.

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:27.860
What would happen?

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:33.850
God, will He make you such absurd things?

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:37.420
Why do you want to fly?

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:44.320
I just can’t understand?

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:53.760
Some scientists came from America to see me,
specially, because they wanted to fly in the

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.880
air.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.110
They wanted to leave their body and go somewhere
else.

01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:09.409
I told them, You have already landed on the
moon.

01:17:09.409 --> 01:17:13.810
Why do you want to fly?”

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:25.500
They said, ”Because Russia is doing that."

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:32.929
I said, ”Which Russian is flying?”

01:17:32.929 --> 01:17:37.320
They said, ”They are doing parapsychology
and ESP."

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:43.810
I said, ”That is all possession of the spirits.

01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:47.870
Do you want domination of the spirits?”

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:56.920
They said, ”We want to fly."

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.170
But I said, ”You will be enslaved by those
spirits."

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:12.710
They said, ”Still we want to do it because
Russia is doing it."

01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:21.420
I said, ”If Russia is going to hell, will
you go to hell, also?”

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:29.690
Surprisingly, they said, ”Yes."

01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:34.710
I said, ”Then go faster there."

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:51.820
I can’t understand these human beings, intelligent
people.

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:54.540
Intelligence is not wisdom.

01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:10.210
When wisdom is enlightened, then you become
complete.

01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:20.610
Because this power controls the whole universe.

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:25.350
It is the complete knowledge.

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:32.130
It is the bliss.

01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:39.900
It is the attention of God which is completely
enlightened.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:52.940
We have to enter into the kingdom of God and
not to waste our life like this.

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:59.770
This is very fantastic.

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:05.110
People cannot believe that you cannot pay
for your realization.

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:17.580
We can’t believe we can get anything without
paying.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:24.280
But how can you pay for your realization?

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:29.960
That is an insult, a debasement.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:43.909
It is a very different thing I am telling
you about, which cannot be sold, which just

01:20:43.909 --> 01:20:44.909
permeates.

01:20:44.909 --> 01:20:51.560
It permeates everywhere.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.250
It wants to be shared by everyone.

01:20:56.250 --> 01:21:14.520
It wants to elevate everyone, to that height
where you are suddenly shot off into the space,

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:23.480
where you become the master of yourself and
one with God.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:32.020
I think for today I have spoken quite a lot
and there are so many things to be said on

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:39.810
this subject.

01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:52.250
We must first have the experience to understand
what I am saying.

01:21:52.250 --> 01:22:03.580
Then use your vibrations on others to see
how you work it out.

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:17.849
If somebody gives me, say, French francs and
I don’t use them, how will I know their

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:19.170
value?

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:30.670
And then establish it within yourself and
enjoy your dignity.

01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:39.719
Till this light is not enlightened it is seeking.

01:22:39.719 --> 01:22:47.429
But once it is enlightened it is just giving
light.

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:53.230
The position changes from that to this.

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:58.840
Then you become the giver.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:06.490
It is that simple and innate within you.

01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:12.170
The time has come for this.

01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:20.010
En masse evolution has started in India.

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:29.380
Even in England there are thousands who have
got realization.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:34.900
I have to see now how far Paris is going to
come up.

01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:41.440
This is the first time I am here.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:58.960
Only through your wisdom and understanding
you can expedite this evolution

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:04.010
and transform the whole world into a new age.

01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:09.750
The time is short.

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:17.730
As I told you Christ is going to come back
with His eleven destructive forces.

01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:30.400
He is going to destroy all that is useless.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.290
This is your last judgement.

01:24:34.290 --> 01:24:40.599
Kundalini awakening is the way you are going
to be judged.

01:24:40.599 --> 01:24:52.840
The last judgment has started; you just face
it.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.400
All grace is with you.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:04.210
I’ll work very hard but you must also have
determination.

01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:07.929
We all have to work hard and share the duty.

01:25:07.929 --> 01:25:08.929
May God Bless you.

01:25:08.929 --> 01:25:31.700
(To a Sahaja Yogi) Can you ask them to take
out the shoes and put both their feet on the

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.700
ground?

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:45.880
Christ’s Mother was the embodiment of that
incarnation.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:54.530
But She was kept completely in the dark because
Christ did not want that Her protocol should

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:59.050
be disturbed.

01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:16.260
If anybody had troubled Her, He would come
down on this Earth with eleven destructive

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:18.360
powers.

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:26.260
But He wore his cross because He had to show
that resurrection is the aim of life.

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:36.350
Put your hands like this.

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:42.409
Straight like this.

01:26:42.409 --> 01:26:43.730
Now ask them to close their eyes
