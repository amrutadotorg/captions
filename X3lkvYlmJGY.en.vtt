00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:18.720
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.200
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.600
sitting here with such shining faces

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.120
from all over the world,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.760
as if My vision has taken its form today.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.480
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.640
who are going to save this world

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.880
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.480
that are surrounding us.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.200
Is coming from all sides,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:39.600
while you people have really taken your second birth

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.080
from this pond of Kali Yuga

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.760
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.560
hues, fragrance and beauty.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.760
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.800
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.600
As I told you the other day that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:22.440
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.240
that it could work out,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.880
otherwise it would have been impossible.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.360
To even transform one person is very difficult,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.880
but you were so sensitive

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.240
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.000
I don’t know how it penetrated your being.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.560
It’s unbelievable.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.440
I can’t believe Myself

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.480
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.600
No one can believe that there are so many

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.120
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.840
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.440
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.400
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.720
and devas, not so many.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.680
One better than the other

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.160
such beautiful heart,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.160
such brilliant brains

00:03:49.480 --> 00:04:02.000
and such active attention, is really

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.720
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.320
so many people, which I never expected.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.160
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.320
and then those who came also,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.160
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.560
all kinds of people created problems for us.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.120
One after another, so many problems came

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.440
and also there were many who were

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.000
of a very low-level seekers.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.360
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.280
I cannot distinguish one from another,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.000
the way it has happened.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.480
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.720
is the greatest blessings for this world.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.360
I could not do it alone. You know that.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.600
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.560
You are the channels

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.120
and you have to work it out further and further.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.560
It is really remarkable the way

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.880
Delhi people have organized everything.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.520
First of all, everybody was very much

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.360
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.680
I don’t know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.040
and then Delhi people said,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040
“This time we are going to celebrate,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.000
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi.”

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.120
I said, “Everybody's … on it, so be careful,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.160
it's not going to be easy. It’s a big headache.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.480
So many will be coming down.”

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.080
But they didn’t expect so much, I’m sure

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.280
… people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.480
hundred from there. I said, “Are you worried?”

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.800
They said, “No we are very happy about it.”

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.320
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.000
the way they have done it.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.920
The best part of it,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.280
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.480
have groups and politics and all that,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.760
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.600
There is no quarrelling.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.520
There is no pulling each other’s legs.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.360
Is very remarkable thing

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.480
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.600
where every day what you hear

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.920
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.760
Perhaps, in this hell only,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.640
this goodness was to be born and

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.720
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.440
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.560
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.200
and it’s not easy

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.720
to penetrate into the so-called

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.200
people who call themselves intellectuals

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:15.320
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.400
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.200
another side the classes who live in the frame

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.840
that they have made out of their brains.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.840
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.240
But the way they have absorbed

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:50.440
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.200
Nobody can comprehend even

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:09.840
that there were so many born after My birth,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.320
on this Earth,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.280
or some maybe before also, very few.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.080
Just after My birth they were born here

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.440
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.840
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.400
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.200
I said, “How will I talk to anyone about it?”

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.360
My family members,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.840
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:57.080
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.680
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.800
there is totality waiting for them?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.920
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.240
which had no connection with reality.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.160
And it was impossible even to envisage

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.280
the method by which I could talk to them.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.400
I remember the first incident

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:38.800
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.120
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.920
Immediately, all the other,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.440
there were hardly about thirty-five people

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.000
they started saying that

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.800
“Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.600
so Mother has given him realization.”

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.640
I think that’s the first time and last time I really got angry.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.560
I started shouting at them,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.560
“You are good for nothing, useless people,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.440
you can never take to Divinity,”

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.200
and I had really thought that “Stop it now.”

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.720
One has to take another life,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.440
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.480
But after that, suddenly,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.760
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.640
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:43.160
And they said, “Mother, You know, it's working.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.040
It's working in us. It's working out of us.”

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.760
Thus, we got twelve people

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.920
and one lady whom I had given before also,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.080
she was the fourteenth.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.960
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.840
for whom it was something out of the blue.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.440
They were all flabbergasted.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.200
They didn't know what it was.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.640
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:38.160
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.880
and started saying, “Jagadamba, Jagadamba.”

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.320
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.600
I've never told otherwise also.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.920
So then, she recited a poem

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.800
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.200
and she was just a maidservant.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.440
And in a man's voice.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.440
So everybody was shocked

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.200
that the bhoots should say all these things.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.760
And then she went away.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.040
After that, these people started probing into it.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.200
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.360
in My house itself.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:36.880
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.760
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.120
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.760
and something will happen to us."

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.360
But after the Puja they said,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.440
“Nothing happened, we are so much better.”

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.920
They all felt the cool breeze

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.720
and the entire atmosphere changed.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.920
They started understanding that

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:08.600
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:16.800
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:24.680
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.760
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.000
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.920
and that's what happened with all of you,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:50.760
that you found out that everywhere

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.040
people were following whatever they’re following,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.880
they were not reaching any point.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.760
Like a cocoon,

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.600
they're hitting their head here and there.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.880
They got their realizations

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.160
so quickly and when they told Me

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.480
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.560
I was amazed.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.920
How this seeking was working within them

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.880
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.080
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:40.720
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.920
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.720
You are just representing your country,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.640
but there are many more in your countries.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.360
Even in India we have many more.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.040
You are just here, come to represent them.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.120
So, multiple of this number,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.600
I do not know how many would be there.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.120
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.000
“I don't know.”

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.120
Say, “You don't know?”

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.880
I said, “No. We have never kept any record.”

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.360
So they can't understand. I said,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:26.520
“We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.520
I don't know how to type.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.240
I don't know how to write even My check.”

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.200
They can't understand

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.320
person like Me existing in these modern times.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.440
But everything gets done, somehow.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.400
Despite all My modern ignorance,

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.880
everything gets absolutely

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.600
done in the most perfect manner

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.720
like a remote control.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.800
Now this whole thing,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.440
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.240
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.920
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.080
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.000
because you all have commitment

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.640
and that commitment gives you

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.040
all these organizing capacities.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.120
So many things you have seen get organized

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.000
because also this Paramchaitanya

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.320
has come into Krita Yuga

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.560
where it is working it out. It’s acting.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:07.200
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.080
For example, the police people told us

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.360
that there are Muslims living here

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.040
and you might have some danger from them.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.520
They might do some harm to you.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.680
I said, “Which Muslims are they?”

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.320
So they said, “Nizamuddin Aulia’s people are here.”

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.200
I said, “They’ll never harm us.”

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.320
I said, “Why? Because he was a Sufi

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.080
and he was a great realized soul

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.360
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.760
at least, believers of Sufism.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.920
How can they harm us?”

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.080
So I said, “Tomorrow, early in the morning,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:59.480
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,”

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.880
and they were so impressed

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.000
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.680
morning time, and they were so respectful.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.840
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.280
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.080
all kinds of things.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.120
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.680
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.400
and I always have admired his poetry

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:33.840
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.040
and divinity.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.760
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.840
and they said, “We are feeling the cool breeze,”

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.080
I said, “This is Ruh.”

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.840
“Ah, this is Ruh.”

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.840
Once these people start getting Ruh,

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.360
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.840
and you may have to have …

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.000
There are so many Sufis all over the world

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.080
and we are going to take their addresses

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.520
and we are going to meet them;

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.240
then you might have to have another big pendal,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.040
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:38.200
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.640
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.800
Also contemporarily,

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.080
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.880
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.200
to give wisdom to those people

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.000
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.480
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.880
With all these Sahaja yogis

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.240
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.720
See, on top of your head

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.360
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.320
though there is no breeze outside,

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.480
the leaves are just steady,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.960
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.920
So I'm sure these vibrations

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.680
will cool down and will bring peace

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.440
to our politicians and to the people

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.840
who are at the helm of affairs.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.120
At this juncture, when in the whole world

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.600
there are so many things going on

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.560
of uncertainties,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.040
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.200
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.200
in England there’s recession,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.360
America there is recession,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.440
Spain there is recession,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.240
everybody is suffering from the pangs

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:36.280
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.360
So, I'm sure this polarity

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.560
that they see now will correct

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.760
their behavior towards materialism

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.440
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.360
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:03.440
this world will be so beautiful,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:12.400
so enchanting that in the history,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.720
people will describe

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.360
that the world itself became a lotus

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.720
full of fragrance of Divinity.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.480
You are the petals,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.200
you are the corona,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.200
you are the color,

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.760
you are the beauty,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.240
you are the pollen

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.920
of that beautiful lotus

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.640
which is My vision of this world.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.480
I hope today

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:11.000
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.440
to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.240
and work for yourself also.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.400
The only danger is

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.440
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.480
That's the only horse.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.280
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.560
you'll progress very fast,

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.760
beautifully.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:49.800
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:58.360
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.800
I don't know what vow I should take.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.600
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.480
I'm working very hard,

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.840
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.840
In the same way, you also,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.720
all of you, have to take a vow today

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.560
that we'll go all out in the commitment

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.800
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.680
We'll think about it.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.520
There are scientists who should produce books,

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.200
there are doctors who should produce books,

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.680
writings,

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.000
go round,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.920
talk to their colleagues,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.880
organize meetings,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.400
seminars with your colleagues.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.680
There are architects

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.200
and other professionals

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.120
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.840
Even the people who are dealing with finances

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.360
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.960
Is very important because

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.200
financial problems can only be

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.080
solved by the Divine Power.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.640
Nobody else can solve it.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.800
So everyone in this world,

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:43.240
whether it is law or any other field,

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:48.480
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.000
and also to creative work.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.320
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.800
to your surroundings,

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:08.320
to villages, to cities,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.360
wherever it is possible,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.760
wherever you can organize,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.640
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.360
As far as curing is concerned,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.720
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.520
Please use only My photograph.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.360
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.800
and less sick people.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.320
Also, people will be cured

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.080
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.680
We have also agricultural field

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.120
on which we have done something,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.520
but much can be done about agriculture.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.200
One should see the government and tell them

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.600
what agriculture can do.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.680
You can form a committee and go and see them

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.800
and talk to them that

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:09.720
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.360
We have to help our children.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.720
We have to look after them

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:23.920
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.120
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.560
even in India.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.360
So we have to see that our children

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.600
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.880
Is very important

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.720
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.560
So many of them are born realized,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.240
so we have to discipline them properly

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.880
and we have to make them aala, “aala darza”

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.440
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:11.880
It is also our family life which is very important.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.920
Is shocking that

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.480
family life is nowadays becoming

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.400
a kind of a stupid thing.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.600
No one understands the importance of it.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.160
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.880
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.240
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:44.120
and there should be a proper rapport

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:51.680
between husband and wife to begin with,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.320
so that there is a companionship

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.640
and the children also see that companionship

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.560
and enjoy it.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.160
In our dress, in our life,

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:12.040
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.520
Is very important.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.000
We should wear whatever suits us

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.760
in whatever country we are.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.800
I mean, imagine in summer climate

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.560
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.000
what will happen to him?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.280
Whatever suits us,

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.600
whatever fits our culture,

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.160
one should try to wear decent dresses,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.880
traditional dresses.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.680
Specially for women, it is very important

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.520
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.800
Also, another point I would like to say,

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:04.680
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.200
at least newspapers.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.360
If your attention is on the problems

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.960
that are in this world, it's very effective

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.800
because you know your attention is active, it works.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.120
So use your attention.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.600
You see the newspapers,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.240
you watch – I know it's horrifying sometimes

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.040
you can give a bandhan,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.400
but you must see what's happening where,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.200
is very important.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.120
Also men should not just read something sensational,

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.280
but read something that's happening

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.680
and also think, what are the solutions.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.080
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.360
in a collective way or in an individual way.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:03.160
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.240
Also one has to read good books,

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.280
good films one has to see,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.000
and have your reflection on them.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.960
Keep your mind alert.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.200
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.680
coming out of

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.600
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.160
beautiful, very high class.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.640
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.760
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.280
from everywhere.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.680
They are trying to systematize now.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.640
And now, in this system,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.280
if you can all help spontaneously,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.720
it will be a great achievement

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.240
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:53.440
all these datas and keep them with us.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.480
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.200
All have to meditate.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.960
Only in meditation you are in present

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.760
and you grow in your spirituality.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.760
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.320
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.920
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.800
no doubt.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.880
We really grow very fast.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.680
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.840
the way he has changed.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.640
And then, once you get used to it,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.360
you'll never give it up.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.320
Is very simple meditation.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.080
You have foot soaking or something like that

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.200
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.880
that's all.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.920
Is not that you have to do

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.360
one lakh jappas or something.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.840
Nothing of the kind.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.560
Is very simple.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.760
But this, you have to do for yourself,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:00.080
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:09.320
We have lots of advantages over others.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.600
But one thing I have to tell you,

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.800
those people who are not prone to seeking,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.360
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.360
Don't waste your energy on such people,

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.360
discussing and arguing,

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.120
because it cannot be discussed much.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.800
You just forget them and leave them alone.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.400
I’ll look after them.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.200
You just take to simple people, good people,

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.280
who are seeking the truth.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.840
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.600
who are just believing in discussion,

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.960
arguments and shabda jaal.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.280
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.400
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.920
there’s something special

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.960
and that they have something very unique

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.760
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.320
All these things, you should understand,

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.440
have come to you spontaneously from within,

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.000
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.480
Should never be shy of your virtues.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.640
And whatever people may try

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.040
to tell you that “You better do this and better do that”

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.000
if it is wrong you should never do it.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.840
Because, now, you are very powerful

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.600
Should just say, “I don't want to do it.”

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.040
and that you have to lead the people

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.720
and people don't have to lead you.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.680
Fashions don't have to lead you,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.160
but you have to create fashions.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.880
You have to create a path for them.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.760
It's not that you have to

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.720
trod on the path that they have made.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.160
Try to understand

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.520
that your own personality

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.720
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.360
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.600
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.680
Don't get ideas from them

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.320
and don't get frightened

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.800
when they try to tell you something

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.720
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.840
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.760
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.160
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.160
that it worked out.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.520
I didn't have to,

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.720
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.360
I just started it.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.520
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.440
not so much agreed to, doesn’t matter.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.480
I started the whole thing on My own,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.320
worked it out on My own,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.640
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.960
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.040
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.120
It has happened.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.080
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.880
All of you should, first of all,

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.200
see that you are not a conditioned person

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.480
and you do not have an ego

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.360
and then you should go ahead with it

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.720
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.480
Today's puja is very short puja.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.960
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.600
There are so many things which I cannot,

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.360
at this time, which is short, tell you

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.320
but if you sit down, you can easily make

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.440
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.800
So, now put your mind to it

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.320
in a way that you are the organizer.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.080
Then what should you do? What can you do?

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.360
What are you going to achieve?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.000
Please try and it will work out.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.480
All of you can do it.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.520
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.560
and write it down in that: what you have done,

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.640
how many people you have given realization,

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.280
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.840
But now, if there’s no diary,

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.160
Sahaja yogis can say among,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.240
“Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow.” No,

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.280
you start it today.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.640
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.560
is that they take things little lightly.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.960
Of course, that is their character.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.520
But not Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.800
Other things you can take lightly.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.560
If somebody shouts at you,

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.040
somebody gets angry with you,

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.600
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.560
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.520
because you are the spirit.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.120
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.000
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.360
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.640
your attitude should be different.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.840
If you are relaxing on one side,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.200
another side you have to be dynamic

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.080
and that side is where you have to put forward

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.640
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.400
when you have to talk to people,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.680
you have to organize a press conference

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.800
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.800
At whatever level you want to work it out,

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.240
please make a proper plan about it

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.360
and just do it.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.720
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.400
With all these ideas that I have,

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.520
you have many more

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.480
and I hope by next year,

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.200
we’ll see manifestation of those.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.360
I hope many people will write books

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.680
like U.C. Rai has written.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.600
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.440
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.160
Everything he has done single-handed.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.880
So beautifully he has worked it out.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:31.360
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.640
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.600
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.720
But it should be honest, very honest book.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.120
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.720
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.920
All those who have such ideas

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.520
should make an effort to create some new books,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.760
some new ideas, some new creation.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.800
Is very important

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.840
because in these modern times

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.120
people want to do something new,

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.040
something novel.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.840
Under these circumstances,

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.640
I’m sure you all will work out.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.720
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:28.840
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.680
and then these can be properly put together,

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.640
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.640
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.920
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.560
This is a very opportune time.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:59.640
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.680
And what will be the symptom

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:26.600
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.640
Whatever people may try,

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.560
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.040
Satyame vijayate.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.960
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.800
For this I congratulate you again and again.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.480
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.040
May God bless you all.
