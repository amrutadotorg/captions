00:09.120 --> 00:18.720
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:27.120 --> 00:34.200
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:36.240 --> 00:44.600
sitting here with such shining faces

00:44.600 --> 00:48.120
from all over the world,

00:50.560 --> 00:57.760
as if My vision has taken its form today.

01:04.840 --> 01:13.480
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

01:13.480 --> 01:17.640
who are going to save this world

01:17.960 --> 01:22.880
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

01:23.120 --> 01:26.480
that are surrounding us.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.200
Is coming from all sides,

01:32.160 --> 01:39.600
while you people have really taken your second birth

01:39.880 --> 01:44.080
from this pond of Kali Yuga

01:44.080 --> 01:49.760
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

01:49.760 --> 01:54.560
hues, fragrance and beauty.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.760
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

01:59.760 --> 02:04.800
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.600
As I told you the other day that

02:12.600 --> 02:22.440
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

02:22.440 --> 02:25.240
that it could work out,

02:27.960 --> 02:30.880
otherwise it would have been impossible.

02:30.880 --> 02:35.360
To even transform one person is very difficult,

02:35.360 --> 02:39.880
but you were so sensitive

02:39.880 --> 02:45.240
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

02:45.240 --> 02:51.000
I don’t know how it penetrated your being.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.560
It’s unbelievable.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.440
I can’t believe Myself

02:57.960 --> 03:05.480
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.600
No one can believe that there are so many

03:09.600 --> 03:12.120
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

03:12.120 --> 03:15.840
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.440
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.400
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

03:29.400 --> 03:32.720
and devas, not so many.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.680
One better than the other

03:36.920 --> 03:43.160
such beautiful heart,

03:45.080 --> 03:49.160
such brilliant brains

03:49.480 --> 04:02.000
and such active attention, is really

04:02.000 --> 04:08.720
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

04:08.720 --> 04:13.320
so many people, which I never expected.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.160
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

04:18.160 --> 04:22.320
and then those who came also,

04:22.320 --> 04:28.160
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

04:28.160 --> 04:32.560
all kinds of people created problems for us.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.120
One after another, so many problems came

04:36.120 --> 04:39.440
and also there were many who were

04:39.440 --> 04:44.000
of a very low-level seekers.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.360
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

04:51.040 --> 04:56.280
I cannot distinguish one from another,

04:56.280 --> 04:59.000
the way it has happened.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.480
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

05:02.480 --> 05:08.720
is the greatest blessings for this world.

05:08.720 --> 05:14.360
I could not do it alone. You know that.

05:14.360 --> 05:19.600
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.560
You are the channels

05:22.800 --> 05:29.120
and you have to work it out further and further.

05:31.160 --> 05:36.560
It is really remarkable the way

05:36.560 --> 05:40.880
Delhi people have organized everything.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.520
First of all, everybody was very much

05:57.520 --> 06:00.360
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.680
I don’t know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

06:05.680 --> 06:07.040
and then Delhi people said,

06:07.040 --> 06:09.040
“This time we are going to celebrate,

06:09.040 --> 06:12.000
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi.”

06:12.280 --> 06:17.120
I said, “Everybody's … on it, so be careful,

06:17.120 --> 06:21.160
it's not going to be easy. It’s a big headache.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.480
So many will be coming down.”

06:25.480 --> 06:29.080
But they didn’t expect so much, I’m sure

06:30.960 --> 06:33.280
… people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

06:33.280 --> 06:37.480
hundred from there. I said, “Are you worried?”

06:37.480 --> 06:40.800
They said, “No we are very happy about it.”

06:40.800 --> 06:45.320
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

06:46.320 --> 06:48.000
the way they have done it.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.920
The best part of it,

06:50.160 --> 06:55.280
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

06:55.560 --> 06:58.480
have groups and politics and all that,

06:58.480 --> 07:03.760
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.600
There is no quarrelling.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.520
There is no pulling each other’s legs.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.360
Is very remarkable thing

07:22.360 --> 07:25.480
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

07:25.480 --> 07:27.600
where every day what you hear

07:27.600 --> 07:32.920
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.760
Perhaps, in this hell only,

07:36.760 --> 07:40.640
this goodness was to be born and

07:40.640 --> 07:43.720
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.440
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

07:46.440 --> 07:51.560
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

07:52.720 --> 07:56.200
and it’s not easy

07:56.960 --> 08:03.720
to penetrate into the so-called

08:03.720 --> 08:07.200
people who call themselves intellectuals

08:07.200 --> 08:15.320
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

08:16.160 --> 08:20.400
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

08:20.400 --> 08:25.200
another side the classes who live in the frame

08:25.200 --> 08:28.840
that they have made out of their brains.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.840
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

08:35.360 --> 08:41.240
But the way they have absorbed

08:41.240 --> 08:50.440
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.200
Nobody can comprehend even

08:59.440 --> 09:09.840
that there were so many born after My birth,

09:09.840 --> 09:13.320
on this Earth,

09:13.520 --> 09:18.280
or some maybe before also, very few.

09:18.280 --> 09:22.080
Just after My birth they were born here

09:24.840 --> 09:29.440
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

09:29.320 --> 09:34.840
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

09:34.840 --> 09:37.400
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.200
I said, “How will I talk to anyone about it?”

09:42.760 --> 09:44.360
My family members,

09:44.360 --> 09:48.840
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

09:49.920 --> 09:57.080
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

09:58.880 --> 10:04.680
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

10:05.160 --> 10:09.800
there is totality waiting for them?

10:09.800 --> 10:13.920
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

10:13.920 --> 10:17.240
which had no connection with reality.

10:19.560 --> 10:24.160
And it was impossible even to envisage

10:24.160 --> 10:28.280
the method by which I could talk to them.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.400
I remember the first incident

10:31.400 --> 10:38.800
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

10:39.440 --> 10:45.120
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.920
Immediately, all the other,

10:48.920 --> 10:52.440
there were hardly about thirty-five people

10:52.440 --> 10:54.000
they started saying that

10:54.000 --> 10:56.800
“Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

10:56.800 --> 10:59.600
so Mother has given him realization.”

10:59.600 --> 11:03.640
I think that’s the first time and last time I really got angry.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.560
I started shouting at them,

11:07.560 --> 11:09.560
“You are good for nothing, useless people,

11:09.560 --> 11:12.440
you can never take to Divinity,”

11:12.440 --> 11:15.200
and I had really thought that “Stop it now.”

11:15.200 --> 11:17.720
One has to take another life,

11:17.720 --> 11:23.440
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

11:23.680 --> 11:28.480
But after that, suddenly,

11:28.480 --> 11:31.760
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

11:31.760 --> 11:36.640
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

11:36.640 --> 11:43.160
And they said, “Mother, You know, it's working.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.040
It's working in us. It's working out of us.”

11:46.040 --> 11:50.760
Thus, we got twelve people

11:50.760 --> 11:57.920
and one lady whom I had given before also,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.080
she was the fourteenth.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.960
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

12:11.280 --> 12:16.840
for whom it was something out of the blue.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.440
They were all flabbergasted.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.200
They didn't know what it was.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.640
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

12:29.640 --> 12:38.160
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

12:38.360 --> 12:43.880
and started saying, “Jagadamba, Jagadamba.”

12:43.880 --> 12:48.320
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.600
I've never told otherwise also.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.920
So then, she recited a poem

12:55.920 --> 12:58.800
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

12:58.800 --> 13:01.200
and she was just a maidservant.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.440
And in a man's voice.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.440
So everybody was shocked

13:08.760 --> 13:12.200
that the bhoots should say all these things.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.760
And then she went away.

13:14.760 --> 13:20.040
After that, these people started probing into it.

13:20.840 --> 13:25.200
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

13:25.200 --> 13:28.360
in My house itself.

13:28.640 --> 13:36.880
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.760
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

13:38.760 --> 13:42.120
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

13:42.120 --> 13:45.760
and something will happen to us."

13:45.760 --> 13:47.360
But after the Puja they said,

13:47.720 --> 13:51.440
“Nothing happened, we are so much better.”

13:51.440 --> 13:55.920
They all felt the cool breeze

13:55.920 --> 13:59.720
and the entire atmosphere changed.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.920
They started understanding that

14:02.920 --> 14:08.600
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

14:09.800 --> 14:16.800
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

14:17.480 --> 14:24.680
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.760
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

14:31.480 --> 14:38.000
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

14:38.000 --> 14:43.920
and that's what happened with all of you,

14:43.920 --> 14:50.760
that you found out that everywhere

14:50.760 --> 14:54.040
people were following whatever they’re following,

14:54.040 --> 14:57.880
they were not reaching any point.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.760
Like a cocoon,

15:00.760 --> 15:04.600
they're hitting their head here and there.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.880
They got their realizations

15:08.200 --> 15:12.160
so quickly and when they told Me

15:14.360 --> 15:17.480
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

15:17.480 --> 15:21.560
I was amazed.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.920
How this seeking was working within them

15:26.920 --> 15:29.880
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.080
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

15:32.080 --> 15:40.720
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

15:40.720 --> 15:46.920
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.720
You are just representing your country,

15:49.720 --> 15:53.640
but there are many more in your countries.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.360
Even in India we have many more.

15:56.360 --> 16:01.040
You are just here, come to represent them.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.120
So, multiple of this number,

16:04.120 --> 16:06.600
I do not know how many would be there.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.120
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

16:09.320 --> 16:11.000
“I don't know.”

16:11.000 --> 16:12.120
Say, “You don't know?”

16:12.480 --> 16:16.880
I said, “No. We have never kept any record.”

16:16.880 --> 16:19.360
So they can't understand. I said,

16:19.360 --> 16:26.520
“We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.520
I don't know how to type.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.240
I don't know how to write even My check.”

16:34.160 --> 16:36.200
They can't understand

16:36.080 --> 16:40.320
person like Me existing in these modern times.

16:41.720 --> 16:45.440
But everything gets done, somehow.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.400
Despite all My modern ignorance,

16:50.400 --> 16:54.880
everything gets absolutely

16:54.880 --> 16:57.600
done in the most perfect manner

16:57.600 --> 17:01.720
like a remote control.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.800
Now this whole thing,

17:06.000 --> 17:11.440
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

17:11.440 --> 17:17.240
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

17:17.240 --> 17:21.920
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.080
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

17:28.080 --> 17:32.000
because you all have commitment

17:32.320 --> 17:35.640
and that commitment gives you

17:35.640 --> 17:40.040
all these organizing capacities.

17:43.560 --> 17:49.120
So many things you have seen get organized

17:49.120 --> 17:53.000
because also this Paramchaitanya

17:53.000 --> 17:57.320
has come into Krita Yuga

17:57.320 --> 18:01.560
where it is working it out. It’s acting.

18:01.560 --> 18:07.200
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.080
For example, the police people told us

18:12.080 --> 18:14.360
that there are Muslims living here

18:14.360 --> 18:17.040
and you might have some danger from them.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.520
They might do some harm to you.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.680
I said, “Which Muslims are they?”

18:21.680 --> 18:26.320
So they said, “Nizamuddin Aulia’s people are here.”

18:27.600 --> 18:30.200
I said, “They’ll never harm us.”

18:30.200 --> 18:34.320
I said, “Why? Because he was a Sufi

18:34.320 --> 18:38.080
and he was a great realized soul

18:38.080 --> 18:43.360
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

18:43.360 --> 18:47.760
at least, believers of Sufism.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.920
How can they harm us?”

18:50.920 --> 18:53.080
So I said, “Tomorrow, early in the morning,

18:53.080 --> 18:59.480
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,”

18:59.480 --> 19:00.880
and they were so impressed

19:00.880 --> 19:06.000
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

19:06.000 --> 19:09.680
morning time, and they were so respectful.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.840
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

19:11.840 --> 19:16.280
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

19:16.280 --> 19:18.080
all kinds of things.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.120
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

19:20.120 --> 19:23.680
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

19:23.680 --> 19:27.400
and I always have admired his poetry

19:27.400 --> 19:33.840
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

19:33.840 --> 19:38.040
and divinity.

19:36.960 --> 19:40.760
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

19:40.760 --> 19:43.840
and they said, “We are feeling the cool breeze,”

19:43.840 --> 19:46.080
I said, “This is Ruh.”

19:46.080 --> 19:48.840
“Ah, this is Ruh.”

19:50.160 --> 19:52.840
Once these people start getting Ruh,

19:52.840 --> 19:55.360
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

19:55.360 --> 19:58.840
and you may have to have …

20:09.960 --> 20:14.000
There are so many Sufis all over the world

20:14.000 --> 20:16.080
and we are going to take their addresses

20:16.080 --> 20:17.520
and we are going to meet them;

20:17.520 --> 20:20.240
then you might have to have another big pendal,

20:20.240 --> 20:24.040
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

20:30.320 --> 20:38.200
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

20:38.200 --> 20:42.640
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.800
Also contemporarily,

21:02.440 --> 21:06.080
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

21:06.080 --> 21:10.880
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

21:10.880 --> 21:14.200
to give wisdom to those people

21:14.200 --> 21:18.000
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

21:18.440 --> 21:22.480
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.880
With all these Sahaja yogis

21:24.880 --> 21:27.240
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.720
See, on top of your head

21:28.720 --> 21:32.360
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

21:32.600 --> 21:35.320
though there is no breeze outside,

21:35.320 --> 21:37.480
the leaves are just steady,

21:37.480 --> 21:41.960
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.920
So I'm sure these vibrations

21:47.920 --> 21:52.680
will cool down and will bring peace

21:52.680 --> 21:57.440
to our politicians and to the people

21:57.440 --> 22:01.840
who are at the helm of affairs.

22:01.840 --> 22:06.120
At this juncture, when in the whole world

22:06.120 --> 22:10.600
there are so many things going on

22:10.600 --> 22:13.560
of uncertainties,

22:13.960 --> 22:17.040
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

22:17.040 --> 22:20.200
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

22:20.200 --> 22:23.200
in England there’s recession,

22:23.200 --> 22:25.360
America there is recession,

22:25.640 --> 22:27.440
Spain there is recession,

22:27.440 --> 22:30.240
everybody is suffering from the pangs

22:30.520 --> 22:36.280
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.360
So, I'm sure this polarity

22:39.360 --> 22:42.560
that they see now will correct

22:42.920 --> 22:46.760
their behavior towards materialism

22:46.760 --> 22:52.440
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.360
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

22:56.360 --> 23:03.440
this world will be so beautiful,

23:03.440 --> 23:12.400
so enchanting that in the history,

23:12.400 --> 23:14.720
people will describe

23:14.720 --> 23:18.360
that the world itself became a lotus

23:18.360 --> 23:23.720
full of fragrance of Divinity.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.480
You are the petals,

23:35.960 --> 23:38.200
you are the corona,

23:40.720 --> 23:43.200
you are the color,

23:44.280 --> 23:46.760
you are the beauty,

23:48.320 --> 23:50.240
you are the pollen

23:51.000 --> 23:54.920
of that beautiful lotus

23:58.080 --> 24:01.640
which is My vision of this world.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.480
I hope today

24:04.480 --> 24:11.000
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

24:11.000 --> 24:12.440
to spread Sahaja Yoga

24:12.440 --> 24:16.240
and work for yourself also.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.400
The only danger is

24:18.400 --> 24:23.440
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

24:23.680 --> 24:28.480
That's the only horse.

24:28.480 --> 24:33.280
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

24:33.280 --> 24:35.560
you'll progress very fast,

24:35.560 --> 24:38.760
beautifully.

24:41.840 --> 24:49.800
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

24:49.800 --> 24:58.360
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

24:58.640 --> 25:03.800
I don't know what vow I should take.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.600
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

25:09.600 --> 25:11.480
I'm working very hard,

25:11.480 --> 25:15.840
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.840
In the same way, you also,

25:25.840 --> 25:28.720
all of you, have to take a vow today

25:28.720 --> 25:33.560
that we'll go all out in the commitment

25:33.560 --> 25:36.800
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.680
We'll think about it.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.520
There are scientists who should produce books,

25:42.520 --> 25:45.200
there are doctors who should produce books,

25:45.200 --> 25:46.680
writings,

25:46.680 --> 25:48.000
go round,

25:48.000 --> 25:49.920
talk to their colleagues,

25:49.920 --> 25:53.880
organize meetings,

25:53.880 --> 25:57.400
seminars with your colleagues.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.680
There are architects

26:03.640 --> 26:08.200
and other professionals

26:08.760 --> 26:14.120
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.840
Even the people who are dealing with finances

26:16.840 --> 26:19.360
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.960
Is very important because

26:22.960 --> 26:27.200
financial problems can only be

26:27.360 --> 26:30.080
solved by the Divine Power.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.640
Nobody else can solve it.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.800
So everyone in this world,

26:37.800 --> 26:43.240
whether it is law or any other field,

26:43.240 --> 26:48.480
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

26:49.360 --> 26:54.000
and also to creative work.

26:54.920 --> 26:59.320
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

26:59.320 --> 27:01.800
to your surroundings,

27:01.800 --> 27:08.320
to villages, to cities,

27:08.320 --> 27:11.360
wherever it is possible,

27:11.360 --> 27:13.760
wherever you can organize,

27:13.760 --> 27:17.640
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.360
As far as curing is concerned,

27:20.360 --> 27:23.720
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.520
Please use only My photograph.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.360
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

27:29.360 --> 27:33.800
and less sick people.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.320
Also, people will be cured

27:36.320 --> 27:40.080
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.680
We have also agricultural field

27:43.680 --> 27:46.120
on which we have done something,

27:46.120 --> 27:51.520
but much can be done about agriculture.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.200
One should see the government and tell them

27:54.200 --> 27:56.600
what agriculture can do.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.680
You can form a committee and go and see them

28:02.000 --> 28:03.800
and talk to them that

28:03.800 --> 28:09.720
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.360
We have to help our children.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.720
We have to look after them

28:14.720 --> 28:23.920
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

28:23.920 --> 28:27.120
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

28:27.120 --> 28:30.560
even in India.

28:30.560 --> 28:34.360
So we have to see that our children

28:34.360 --> 28:37.600
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.880
Is very important

28:40.880 --> 28:44.720
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.560
So many of them are born realized,

28:47.560 --> 28:50.240
so we have to discipline them properly

28:50.240 --> 28:55.880
and we have to make them aala, “aala darza”

28:55.880 --> 29:00.440
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

29:04.920 --> 29:11.880
It is also our family life which is very important.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.920
Is shocking that

29:13.920 --> 29:17.480
family life is nowadays becoming

29:17.480 --> 29:21.400
a kind of a stupid thing.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.600
No one understands the importance of it.

29:24.600 --> 29:28.160
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

29:28.160 --> 29:32.880
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

29:32.880 --> 29:38.240
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

29:38.200 --> 29:44.120
and there should be a proper rapport

29:44.120 --> 29:51.680
between husband and wife to begin with,

29:51.680 --> 29:55.320
so that there is a companionship

29:55.320 --> 29:58.640
and the children also see that companionship

29:58.640 --> 30:02.560
and enjoy it.

30:03.720 --> 30:07.160
In our dress, in our life,

30:07.160 --> 30:12.040
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.520
Is very important.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.000
We should wear whatever suits us

30:17.000 --> 30:19.760
in whatever country we are.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.800
I mean, imagine in summer climate

30:22.800 --> 30:25.560
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

30:25.800 --> 30:28.000
what will happen to him?

30:28.680 --> 30:30.280
Whatever suits us,

30:30.280 --> 30:34.600
whatever fits our culture,

30:34.600 --> 30:39.160
one should try to wear decent dresses,

30:39.160 --> 30:41.880
traditional dresses.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.680
Specially for women, it is very important

30:44.680 --> 30:49.520
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.800
Also, another point I would like to say,

30:59.800 --> 31:04.680
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

31:05.360 --> 31:08.200
at least newspapers.

31:08.520 --> 31:12.360
If your attention is on the problems

31:12.360 --> 31:15.960
that are in this world, it's very effective

31:15.960 --> 31:20.800
because you know your attention is active, it works.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.120
So use your attention.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.600
You see the newspapers,

31:26.600 --> 31:29.240
you watch – I know it's horrifying sometimes

31:29.240 --> 31:31.040
you can give a bandhan,

31:31.040 --> 31:34.400
but you must see what's happening where,

31:34.400 --> 31:37.200
is very important.

31:37.200 --> 31:42.120
Also men should not just read something sensational,

31:42.120 --> 31:45.280
but read something that's happening

31:45.280 --> 31:48.680
and also think, what are the solutions.

31:48.680 --> 31:52.080
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

31:52.080 --> 31:55.360
in a collective way or in an individual way.

31:55.360 --> 32:03.160
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

32:03.160 --> 32:06.240
Also one has to read good books,

32:06.240 --> 32:09.280
good films one has to see,

32:09.280 --> 32:12.000
and have your reflection on them.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.960
Keep your mind alert.

32:13.960 --> 32:18.200
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

32:18.200 --> 32:19.680
coming out of

32:19.680 --> 32:22.600
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

32:22.600 --> 32:25.160
beautiful, very high class.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.640
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.760
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

32:31.760 --> 32:33.280
from everywhere.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.680
They are trying to systematize now.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.640
And now, in this system,

32:38.640 --> 32:41.280
if you can all help spontaneously,

32:41.280 --> 32:45.720
it will be a great achievement

32:45.720 --> 32:49.240
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

32:49.240 --> 32:53.440
all these datas and keep them with us.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.480
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.200
All have to meditate.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.960
Only in meditation you are in present

33:03.960 --> 33:06.760
and you grow in your spirituality.

33:06.760 --> 33:10.760
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

33:10.760 --> 33:14.320
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

33:14.320 --> 33:17.920
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

33:19.120 --> 33:20.800
no doubt.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.880
We really grow very fast.

33:22.880 --> 33:25.680
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

33:25.680 --> 33:27.840
the way he has changed.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.640
And then, once you get used to it,

33:29.880 --> 33:32.360
you'll never give it up.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.320
Is very simple meditation.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.080
You have foot soaking or something like that

33:37.080 --> 33:40.200
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

33:40.200 --> 33:41.880
that's all.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.920
Is not that you have to do

33:44.920 --> 33:48.360
one lakh jappas or something.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.840
Nothing of the kind.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.560
Is very simple.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.760
But this, you have to do for yourself,

33:53.760 --> 34:00.080
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

34:02.560 --> 34:09.320
We have lots of advantages over others.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.600
But one thing I have to tell you,

34:11.600 --> 34:16.800
those people who are not prone to seeking,

34:16.800 --> 34:20.360
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.360
Don't waste your energy on such people,

34:23.360 --> 34:25.360
discussing and arguing,

34:25.360 --> 34:28.120
because it cannot be discussed much.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.800
You just forget them and leave them alone.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.400
I’ll look after them.

34:32.400 --> 34:36.200
You just take to simple people, good people,

34:36.200 --> 34:40.280
who are seeking the truth.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.840
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

34:42.840 --> 34:46.600
who are just believing in discussion,

34:46.520 --> 34:49.960
arguments and shabda jaal.

34:49.960 --> 34:54.280
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

34:54.280 --> 34:57.400
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

34:57.400 --> 34:59.920
there’s something special

35:00.160 --> 35:04.960
and that they have something very unique

35:04.960 --> 35:10.760
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.320
All these things, you should understand,

35:13.320 --> 35:16.440
have come to you spontaneously from within,

35:16.440 --> 35:20.000
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.480
Should never be shy of your virtues.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.640
And whatever people may try

35:26.640 --> 35:29.040
to tell you that “You better do this and better do that”

35:29.040 --> 35:31.000
if it is wrong you should never do it.

35:29.680 --> 35:35.840
Because, now, you are very powerful

35:31.000 --> 35:33.600
Should just say, “I don't want to do it.”

35:40.800 --> 35:43.040
and that you have to lead the people

35:43.040 --> 35:44.720
and people don't have to lead you.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.680
Fashions don't have to lead you,

35:46.680 --> 35:49.160
but you have to create fashions.

35:49.160 --> 35:52.880
You have to create a path for them.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.760
It's not that you have to

35:55.760 --> 35:59.720
trod on the path that they have made.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.160
Try to understand

36:01.160 --> 36:04.520
that your own personality

36:04.520 --> 36:09.720
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

36:09.720 --> 36:13.360
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

36:13.360 --> 36:18.600
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.680
Don't get ideas from them

36:20.680 --> 36:22.320
and don't get frightened

36:22.320 --> 36:24.800
when they try to tell you something

36:24.800 --> 36:27.720
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

36:27.720 --> 36:32.840
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.760
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

36:35.760 --> 36:39.160
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

36:39.160 --> 36:42.160
that it worked out.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.520
I didn't have to,

36:45.520 --> 36:49.720
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

36:49.720 --> 36:54.360
I just started it.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.520
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

36:57.720 --> 37:01.440
not so much agreed to, doesn’t matter.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.480
I started the whole thing on My own,

37:04.480 --> 37:06.320
worked it out on My own,

37:06.320 --> 37:09.640
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

37:09.640 --> 37:12.960
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

37:12.960 --> 37:16.040
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.120
It has happened.

37:18.120 --> 37:21.080
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.880
All of you should, first of all,

37:22.880 --> 37:25.200
see that you are not a conditioned person

37:25.200 --> 37:27.480
and you do not have an ego

37:27.480 --> 37:30.360
and then you should go ahead with it

37:30.360 --> 37:33.720
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

37:33.720 --> 37:37.480
Today's puja is very short puja.

37:37.760 --> 37:41.960
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.600
There are so many things which I cannot,

37:45.600 --> 37:51.360
at this time, which is short, tell you

37:51.360 --> 37:54.320
but if you sit down, you can easily make

37:54.320 --> 37:58.440
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.800
So, now put your mind to it

38:01.800 --> 38:06.320
in a way that you are the organizer.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.080
Then what should you do? What can you do?

38:09.080 --> 38:10.360
What are you going to achieve?

38:10.360 --> 38:15.000
Please try and it will work out.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.480
All of you can do it.

38:17.480 --> 38:20.520
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

38:20.520 --> 38:23.560
and write it down in that: what you have done,

38:23.560 --> 38:25.640
how many people you have given realization,

38:25.640 --> 38:30.280
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.840
But now, if there’s no diary,

38:32.840 --> 38:34.160
Sahaja yogis can say among,

38:34.160 --> 38:37.240
“Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow.” No,

38:37.240 --> 38:40.280
you start it today.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.640
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

38:44.640 --> 38:48.560
is that they take things little lightly.

38:51.600 --> 38:55.960
Of course, that is their character.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.520
But not Sahaja Yoga.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.800
Other things you can take lightly.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.560
If somebody shouts at you,

39:03.560 --> 39:05.040
somebody gets angry with you,

39:05.040 --> 39:07.600
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.560
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

39:10.560 --> 39:12.520
because you are the spirit.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.120
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

39:14.120 --> 39:17.000
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.360
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

39:21.360 --> 39:23.640
your attitude should be different.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.840
If you are relaxing on one side,

39:26.040 --> 39:29.200
another side you have to be dynamic

39:29.200 --> 39:32.080
and that side is where you have to put forward

39:32.080 --> 39:33.640
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

39:33.640 --> 39:35.400
when you have to talk to people,

39:35.400 --> 39:37.680
you have to organize a press conference

39:37.680 --> 39:39.800
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.800
At whatever level you want to work it out,

39:41.800 --> 39:44.240
please make a proper plan about it

39:44.240 --> 39:46.360
and just do it.

39:46.360 --> 39:50.720
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

39:51.040 --> 39:56.400
With all these ideas that I have,

39:57.520 --> 40:00.520
you have many more

40:00.520 --> 40:04.480
and I hope by next year,

40:04.480 --> 40:07.200
we’ll see manifestation of those.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.360
I hope many people will write books

40:09.360 --> 40:11.680
like U.C. Rai has written.

40:11.680 --> 40:17.600
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.440
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

40:20.440 --> 40:23.160
Everything he has done single-handed.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.880
So beautifully he has worked it out.

40:25.880 --> 40:31.360
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

40:31.640 --> 40:34.640
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

40:34.440 --> 40:37.600
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

40:37.680 --> 40:42.720
But it should be honest, very honest book.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.120
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

40:46.120 --> 40:50.720
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.920
All those who have such ideas

40:52.920 --> 40:58.520
should make an effort to create some new books,

40:58.520 --> 41:03.760
some new ideas, some new creation.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.800
Is very important

41:05.800 --> 41:07.840
because in these modern times

41:07.840 --> 41:11.120
people want to do something new,

41:11.120 --> 41:14.040
something novel.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.840
Under these circumstances,

41:16.840 --> 41:19.640
I’m sure you all will work out.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.720
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

41:23.720 --> 41:28.840
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

41:28.840 --> 41:32.680
and then these can be properly put together,

41:32.680 --> 41:36.640
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.640
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

41:39.640 --> 41:42.920
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.560
This is a very opportune time.

41:50.920 --> 41:59.640
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

42:16.880 --> 42:20.680
And what will be the symptom

42:20.680 --> 42:26.600
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.640
Whatever people may try,

42:37.640 --> 42:40.560
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.040
Satyame vijayate.

42:42.040 --> 42:46.960
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.800
For this I congratulate you again and again.

42:54.800 --> 42:58.480
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

42:58.480 --> 43:02.040
May God bless you all.
