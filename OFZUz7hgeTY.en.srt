1
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,960
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

2
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,020
everybody has said

3
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,930
Mother please tell us about Shri Ram

4
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,990
As you know that Shri Rama has taken
a very important place in our chakras

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,330
He is sitting on our right heart

6
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:06,230
Shri Rama has taken a place of a father

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:22,167
so lack of father's duty and love 
can cause a catch of this chakra

8
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,833
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand 
that Rama and all other gods

9
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,760
came on earth with different power (shakti),

10
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:44,850
they came to do their jobs

11
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:49,676
In the sense Shri Rama has a special job

12
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:58,050
Socrates has said 
benevolent king has to come

13
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,532
For that Shri Rama came

14
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,670
Shri Rama came in complete human form

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,020
He even forgot that

16
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,730
he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu
 He was made to be forgotten

17
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:26,740
But he was Purushottam on earth
(perfect human being)

18
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:35,470
you all must have heard of
his qualities and his childhood

19
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:43,006
In Sahaja yoga
when we worship any god

20
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:58,120
what quality we gain from them

21
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,760
which qualities we will receive?

22
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,220
Shri Rama has many

23
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:15,230
One that he was ideal
another that he is a king

24
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,350
he kept his people higher than himself

25
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,320
than his wife and children

26
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:33,610
If politicians today

27
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,160
understand this point

28
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,260
they wouldn't be called selfish

29
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,450
they wouldn't be selfish

30
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,800
would be follower of Dharma.

31
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,040
Nobody has followed

32
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:56,040
Shri Rama as a role model
till today

33
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,000
By singing his bhajans

34
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:06,221
or building an institutions and temples
in his name

35
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:11,700
Shri Rama come to you?

36
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,440
Do you get his light in your life?

37
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:24,736
Only sahaj yogi can bring the light
of Shri Rama into the attention

38
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,626
He is totally beyond

39
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,425
Basically all the deities are
free from papas and punyas

40
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:40,605
so called sins
they never sin

41
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,965
Shri Krishna killed many people

42
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:48,253
Shri Rama killed Ravana

43
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:53,215
It can be a sin in worldly sense

44
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,325
but not in the eyes of god

45
00:04:56,627 --> 00:05:08,560
As they destroy and remove evils 
they have rights to do anything

46
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:16,670
When Devi slayed Rakshas
she has committed a sin?

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:26,219
Their work is to destroy the
rakshas and protect the saints

48
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:37,785
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is 
the most important

49
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:41,656
she was cursed by her husband

50
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:47,222
In those times if any women
goes out of dharma

51
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:53,535
and if her husband is high saint
he could curse

52
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:59,395
But Ahillya was blamed falsely

53
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:04,801
And she was made into stone falsely

54
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,030
So shri Rama saved Ahilya

55
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:23,099
Especially his quality to have only one wife

56
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:28,423
his love to one wife must be understood

57
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,505
Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi
she herself is a Goddess

58
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:46,065
But as a Human he never looked
 at any other women but his wife

59
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,589
When we talk about Rama
we should have the husband pure

60
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:55,753
To worships shri Rama

61
00:06:56,026 --> 00:07:06,145
Women should have the same faith 
in husbands as Sitaji used to

62
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:12,423
Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram 
who believed one wife

63
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:15,375
Not difficult for sahaja yogis

64
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,350
Women should be respected
 Have respect for wifes

65
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,360
When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

66
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,025
Shri Rama felt his duty
 to rescue her

67
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:37,650
But in his kingdom
he was so just that

68
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,990
For people he left her 
after spending so many years to rescue

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,140
As Sitaji herself a Devi
 so there's no effect

70
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,026
So Shri Rama did it

71
00:07:54,105 --> 00:08:00,547
to keep the benevolence 
of public opinion

72
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,660
that society wouln't accpect the women

73
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:10,650
who are questioned.

74
00:08:11,737 --> 00:08:17,108
Although she is a Devi
Pure and Nirmala

75
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:21,536
Later that
Sita also left him somehow

76
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:28,235
She left him as a woman
and Shri Rama as a man

77
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:36,554
Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth
and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

78
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:43,638
Their life is very eventful
 and full of Miracles

79
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:53,137
You see how shri Sita and Rama
have good attitude and are faithful each other

80
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,215
Even if she was left
Sita thought it her duty

81
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:05,305
She never complained
or talked ill of him

82
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,787
And effortlessly 
she has raised her children

83
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:17,952
Shri Rama's children are
called Luv and Kush

84
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:26,854
They came as devotees
and we can see them as disciples

85
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,090
They represents Shisya (disciples)

86
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:38,090
the power of Shisya
so we can be disciple of someone

87
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,120
As disciples they learned archery
when they were small

88
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:51,538
And learned Ramayana
and got proficiency in the music

89
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:59,435
Showing the disciples must surrender completely
to the Guru

90
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:04,065
We also have a disciples in us

91
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:11,548
They were  completely surrendered to 
 the Mother who is Shakti

92
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,500
Even they were about to fight
against Shri Rama

93
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:21,000
they kept Mother highest in the world

94
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,670
The mother cared them
and made them completely dharmic

95
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,590
It was her first duty

96
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,650
Not like today wives just cry
"my husband left me"

97
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,643
But with husband they fight always 
and if he leaves they will cry

98
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:50,437
He has left no problem
I have children, I will care for them

99
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,430
they will get all they need

100
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:05,210
Sitaj's life was special
with bravery and strength

101
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,130
Every woman must have it

102
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,200
Even if you are separated with your
husband or far away

103
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:21,000
there shouldn't be any loss
or shortage for children

104
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:26,673
Because her duty
is the most important thing

105
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,018
We shouldn't give up
most important thing

106
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:36,775
In sahaja yoga
all women should get this power

107
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,970
Shri Rama's life was
very pure and Nirmal

108
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,040
he gave up everything
for his wife

109
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:57,320
His wife had gone, he had to live alone
and he had to leave her

110
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,680
He gave up all the comforts of the life

111
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:08,880
You know he used to sleep
on grass, on floor and walked barefeet

112
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,476
and wear clothes like saints

113
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,250
All these are not stories
it's a fact

114
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:24,350
In India many people used to have
high standard life

115
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,170
and they have never thought about
 small and low level things

116
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:37,266
But all these ideals of our country
have beccome fake

117
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:44,085
By singing bhajans to Ram
 we think we are done

118
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:47,215
we have got a kind of hypocracy

119
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,047
In countries without
these ideals

120
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:56,415
people try to become the ideals
correcting themselves

121
00:12:56,471 --> 00:13:01,206
If you have the ideal in front of us

122
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,560
you don't  become Shri Rama or Krishna

123
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,100
or you have anything to do with them

124
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,430
We feel like that

125
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:17,053
But if we have Shri Rama inside
his light can be in our attention

126
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:20,148
Let's understand

127
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:26,691
the circumstances when
Shri Rama came on earth

128
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,313
Sahaja Yogi must understand

129
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:39,320
If we get Shri Rama's state 
All our political problems will go

130
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,403
when we decide to 
become like shri Rama

131
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:03,620
Then everyone becomes good

132
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:15,150
firstly dharma, success and education
then the ideals

133
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:22,290
for that he made his life very idealistic

134
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:29,270
When someone tells you something
but he doesn't do it himself

135
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,852
Then how can you trust him and get his quality

136
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:38,110
There are many people who say
we believe in this and that

137
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,080
But they are opposite

138
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:50,014
Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician 
and they have many wives, impossible

139
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,710
What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life?

140
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,191
we have to bring the light of god
in our attention

141
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,875
We must see and behave as Shri Rama

142
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:14,518
What would Shri Rama or Sita do 
in this situation

143
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:20,195
What would Sita ji say?

144
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,474
How would Sita behave?
She is also Gruhlaxmi

145
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:30,100
As you know Sitaji took many births

146
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,670
Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi

147
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:43,855
She was humbly in the house but all
dharma was done by her power

148
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:50,165
Not necessary for her to go out 
and give big lectures

149
00:15:50,190 --> 00:16:00,050
You can do that work at home
with children relatives and friends

150
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:04,940
you can spread sahaja Yoga at the house

151
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,170
After getting all of it
 you can go out to society

152
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:19,660
But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first

153
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,920
First thing of the purity is
motherhood and love

154
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:30,550
When she was in exile never complained
 that my husband doesn't earn

155
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,765
He doesn't do this
he doesn't buy this and that

156
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:40,820
If he is in jungle so I am
What he will eat I wil

157
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:45,627
I don't eat before him
I serve him first

158
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:49,991
and  brother in law then I will eat

159
00:16:50,071 --> 00:17:04,070
Nowadays women think there is
much pressure of the work But it is not

160
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:11,026
A woman is like earth element
she can absorb

161
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:15,972
So many are given by the earth

162
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:20,780
In the same way 
women are like the earth

163
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:25,831
We have got so many powers
 that we can take everything inside

164
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:32,212
and shower the rain of love
God has given us the power

165
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:42,162
For example this fan is moving
Which one is greater, the power or fan?

166
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,550
If you think fan is greater as  it's moving
Then it's wrong

167
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,890
Women are ocean of shakti

168
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:59,765
With that support Men does their work

169
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:07,029
They are potential and kinetic 
Women are potential and men are kinetic

170
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:12,345
But if you start running like them

171
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:15,695
It's not good
No need for women

172
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:25,376
Each one is unique but equally important
But women can be good for both

173
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:30,015
When the time comes 
women can be more productive

174
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,550
In Maharashtra
there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai

175
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,960
She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji

176
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,390
Only she could defeat Aurangzeb

177
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,495
Her grave was built

178
00:18:48,495 --> 00:19:02,109
You must understand women can keep all her
power within her to become ferocious

179
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:14,530
But  if she waste her powers in
fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things

180
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,660
then her power would be gone

181
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:25,960
Women are so powerful that
she can work more than men if she want

182
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,437
But first of all
she must respect her powers

183
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:35,623
by scattering and wasting she becomes powerless

184
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:38,274
this kind of woman is not good

185
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:45,534
Women's job is very important and full of dignity

186
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:50,221
Women should be very modest and very wise

187
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:55,115
Let Men use bad words but women cannot

188
00:19:55,312 --> 00:20:01,779
Men can argue and would fight
let them do but not Women

189
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:09,803
Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people

190
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:17,490
She is like shield not like sword
and sword cannot be shield

191
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,440
Shield is greater than sword
as shield can bear the sword

192
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:28,910
Sword can be broken
but not shield

193
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:37,530
So her most important power is humility

194
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,540
With humility comes all the powers

195
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,370
It's not difficult for sahaj yogis
not at all

196
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,440
I see many sahaja yoginis chat a lot

197
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,140
anywhere they will chat with men

198
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,430
"Mother help me" "what happened"

199
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,990
"The lady talks a lot please help me"

200
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,915
"I am tired of her"

201
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:11,171
There isn't much to talk with men
What's the need?

202
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,773
Among women also

203
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:20,435
In sahaja yoga men study more

204
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,795
About Sahaja Yoga and the chakras

205
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:30,690
Which chakra is driving people and is catching?

206
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,580
Man knows all
women would be left behind

207
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,492
Women must learn

208
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:43,055
For men Shri Rama is our ideal

209
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,755
In this sense Muslims are amazing

210
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,185
I don't want to say bad things

211
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,870
Say if you go to Riyad
no  Muslim will see you

212
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,500
they will respect women
If women are crossing the street

213
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,670
they will stop the car
respecting women

214
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,540
But here it's opposite
I don't know why

215
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,100
we see women with some intention

216
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,190
Seeing every woman
 they will break the neck

217
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,710
It's a big sin to see every woman

218
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:30,609
In sahaja yoga it's prohibited completely

219
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:35,905
Firstly you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga

220
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,950
Otherwise you may become blind

221
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,060
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes

222
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:49,435
While talking eyes are wandering
women too

223
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,750
The biggest loss is your attention

224
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,990
Your attention goes here and there

225
00:22:58,015 --> 00:23:02,375
then what's the use of self-realization

226
00:23:02,385 --> 00:23:08,710
Without concentration Chitta can't be active

227
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,900
Concentration must be obtained

228
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:18,573
In the west the disease is
more common among men

229
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:24,505
Western yogis are not alike
They know it's bad

230
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,620
They asked me the solution

231
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:38,135
Look at only ground and up to 3 feets
you don't have to see above

232
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:46,530
Look at the ground
Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad

233
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:56,700
You see all good things, flowers and children
Nothing to see above

234
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,240
So, that's how you should control your chitta

235
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,100
Shri Rama didn't need it
If you have a respect to shri Rama

236
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:10,825
You must control your chitta like him

237
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:22,098
Tell your wife you respect her as shakti
But she has to deserve it

238
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:26,475
"Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata"

239
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:37,314
"Where women are respected resides
god" But they have to be respectable

240
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,108
Please sit down

241
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:46,100
Don't move during Puja

242
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,840
If the woman is worshipable
"Pujyante" means "worshipable"

243
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,990
Who like to worship a bad woman
cruel Rakshasi?

244
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:07,350
Those who are worshpable should be worshipped
There resides gods

245
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,256
Firstly they are mothers of children

246
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:17,304
If husband scolds wife in front of children

247
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,860
then children will never respect mother

248
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:25,995
It's prime minister and deputy minister

249
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,080
Women shouldn't insult her husband too

250
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:37,030
Power goes to children from father

251
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:45,487
Without this basic understanding
they fight to take control

252
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:50,010
If woman knows handling of man
there won't be any fights

253
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:56,290
Handling men is very easy 
as they are just like children

254
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:01,975
they are innocent like children

255
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:05,615
By talking nonsense
 you can't handle them

256
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,884
You must forgive them as children

257
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:12,675
If they fight outside 
they get troubled

258
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,140
They can get angry only to wife

259
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:19,225
Getting angry at home is OK

260
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:28,387
Until you get this feeling, you cannot have
 mutual understanding, love and joy

261
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:34,482
Men also should care for wife's needs

262
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:46,465
if wife is wrong, husband has duty to say no
"It's wrong, I won't do this"

263
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:52,885
But no need to fight on small things
It doesn't look good as sahaja yogis

264
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,640
I am surprised that 
Sahaja couples fight each other

265
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,570
They come to complain about each other

266
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:11,795
How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully
while I'm talking about peace to the whole world

267
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,080
It won't work out if you are fighting like that

268
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:23,239
Husband has to have complete
understanding of his wife first

269
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:31,890
And know that all the other women
are like your sisters and mothers

270
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:36,695
If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga
then there's no way out

271
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:41,725
There was a swiss man
not a Sahaja Yogi

272
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:47,630
Not Indian 
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini

273
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:54,475
Girl's husband had wandering
eyes but came to sahaja yoga

274
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:02,498
They both came to Sahaja Yoga 
The girl is very good but he went on doing it

275
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:07,800
The non-yogi father told her to leave him

276
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,160
"Even after sahaja yoga if he can't be cleansed
then leave him"

277
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:22,300
"He is not a Sahaja Yogi don't relate with him"

278
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:31,340
Even Non-Sahaja Yogi can understand
that the person can't be cleansed

279
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:38,150
He doesn't have stable attention
then it is bad

280
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:45,710
Our culture is that men and women
must be brother and sister

281
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:52,670
But I see a talkative woman
just go to talk to men

282
00:28:52,670 --> 00:29:01,380
I don't understand it
They don't sit with other ladies but with men

283
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,055
Same with men just start chatting with women

284
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:17,225
Even with maid or anyone
just start talking, no self-esteem

285
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,670
We think it's masculinity but Shri Rama is
the perfect man who is highest

286
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,670
But the one at the bottom 
think they are perfect

287
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:35,950
Where is perfection?
Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil

288
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,600
If you believe in Shri Rama
follow his ideal

289
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,036
Therefore children and women
are getting spoiled

290
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:50,550
But still Indian women maintained
good culture here

291
00:29:50,550 --> 00:30:00,370
If they were like Americans what it would have been 
Men are fixed in terrible condition there

292
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:13,970
After 2-3 marriages Men becomes
bunkrupt but women make a palace

293
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,000
It's bad in America
Children are running away from home

294
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,140
Indian woman manage their house
husband and children

295
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:33,015
But it's changing
They think the same like husbands

296
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,440
If he runs away with 10 women
then we go with 15 men

297
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,290
If he is going to hell then I go before him

298
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,625
Women shouldn't do it
The base of dharma is in woman's hand

299
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:57,245
Woman must manage husband dharmic
making him understand

300
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:02,847
This is the biggest duty and power
of woman to be Dharmaic

301
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:10,510
Biggest dharma is forgiveness
Without it nothing works out

302
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,760
First thing she must have forgiveness
Forgive children, husband

303
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,220
give refuge to house servants
all are her duty

304
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:30,841
This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do
neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus

305
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:44,010
Rama would have killed everyone
who is useless, adharmic and flirt

306
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,420
Don't know how many he would be finished

307
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:53,030
Krishna would use his sudarshan
chakra and there would be a battle

308
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,265
Christ would crucify himself

309
00:31:56,265 --> 00:32:02,535
One crucifiction is better than everyday

310
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,690
Only Mother can do this work
 With such a power of love

311
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:13,263
Anything can be worked out with her power of love

312
00:32:13,295 --> 00:32:19,920
She holds everything with so much love
that children don't mind correcting

313
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,360
For instance when trouble comes only mother
knows how to handle it and scold later

314
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,580
Because children understands mother's love
and it is for them

315
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:40,290
With father children may react
but not with mother's love without expectation

316
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:49,425
She doesn't want anything but her children to be good
and get all my powers, all good in me

317
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:54,485
If mother feels it children will be fine

318
00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:01,960
But some mothers are very interfering
and get involved in everything

319
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,290
She comes always in front
while husband is at the back

320
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,290
Children will be spoiled by it

321
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:17,363
Under such harmful environment children
can be very emotional

322
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:22,515
So woman should be behind
and make her husband in front

323
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,200
Whatever husbands do
wifes must help him behind

324
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:36,590
The source of his power is wife
Then how pure and hard-working she should be

325
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:43,420
I put everything on woman
because I know you have great powers inside

326
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,410
Look at me as a Mother
I must make everyone saints

327
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,340
Curing many diseases
to make people saints

328
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,490
Did anyone do this job?
Only Ahilya was saved

329
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,755
Jesus saved 21 people

330
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:05,035
I must have saved 21000 now

331
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:10,065
Going around the world to do
everyone's job

332
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:16,755
it's still going on but I don't feel
because of love

333
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:23,800
Maybe I should put bandhan
as I don't know what kind of people I meet

334
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,280
But as soon as people comes to me
 I absorb all the problems

335
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,805
So love acts by itself
I know everything is done by love

336
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:42,783
I don't feel bad whatever happens
Only Mother can bear the pain

337
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:51,360
So I want you to grow consistantly
without hurdles

338
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:59,820
Also men should help their wives fully
Understand and respect them

339
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:09,131
Until the 2 wheels gets balanced
the chariot doesn't go forward

340
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:16,945
They both should be the same but
one on the left and the other on the right

341
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,830
It won't work if you change it

342
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:35,255
It is moving and working
because they are the same but unique

343
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:50,230
Same in the sense of height
length and width but they work differently

344
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,280
It's the same in our life

345
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:07,260
Shri Rama didn't think
only about husband and wife

346
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,950
Didn't think only about children and family

347
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:21,965
Also of brother, sister, mother, father
and everyone as a normal human being

348
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:28,515
After he thought about society

349
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,700
About public, state and country

350
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:46,050
As a human being he has shown
human ideals in his activities

351
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:56,280
The person who loved his wife so much
knew she was pure and hed left her

352
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:08,075
Now people give so much to their own wife
but they never give to poor people

353
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,965
Otherwise they give to their relatives
It's a disease among politicians

354
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:23,735
But the one who has wife who is sakshat
devi had to leave her

355
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:32,300
We must understand it's attachment
to relatives and possessions

356
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:39,620
In west marriage relation wasn't alright
but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything

357
00:37:39,645 --> 00:37:47,508
Here leaders had to leave
because their wives were not alright

358
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,090
Their attention got spoiled
by wife's preaching

359
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,339
At least five yogi left
 because of their wives

360
00:37:56,805 --> 00:38:07,830
Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga
and their role in it

361
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:13,570
In this case husbands shouldn't
agree with their wives at all

362
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:19,530
Tell her that “You talk and move
too much, Be quiet"

363
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,950
You are useless
Your chakras are not alright

364
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,075
She will be alright only in this way

365
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:34,380
But instead you blame yourself
and obey your wife?

366
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:37,475
If she tells you to steal, you do it?

367
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:45,990
Even after Sahaja Yoga you still
have some catches to take care

368
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:56,990
On the occasion of Shri Rama
Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee

369
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,470
And how he was busy at his service

370
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:13,465
He was aware that his life is
for serving Shri Rama

371
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:20,645
We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga

372
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:27,410
But it doesn't mean you cook food for
me which I don't eat

373
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:33,745
You trouble me cooking so much
this and that

374
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:39,745
Don't keep on serving someone forcefully

375
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:45,930
What we need is zeal to serve (Sewa)

376
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,425
Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama

377
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:52,828
Delhi people kept on
serving food so much

378
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:58,680
that I had to tell them
I wouln't come if you don't stop

379
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:02,630
Do what you have to do

380
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,892
It's bad to force someone to eat

381
00:40:06,892 --> 00:40:10,515
serving one after another

382
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,580
I don't need anything
and I am tired

383
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:22,359
I told you only flowers
But don't spend too much also

384
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:30,045
A lot of flowers make me
worry sometimes

385
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:38,347
Please your Mother in balance 
She is a simple woman who don't understand these

386
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:46,375
We have to learn that zeal to serve is
from Hanuman ji

387
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,340
There is no special service for me

388
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:58,455
But if you want to serve me
 serve to Sahaj Yoga

389
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,660
Serving to Sahaja Yoga is
serving to me

390
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,240
How many realisation have you given

391
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,764
How many did you transform and inspire

392
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:18,220
But if you say to new people 
they have bhoot, they just leave

393
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:29,080
One gentleman was told he has 
3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga

394
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,880
he was told number of bhoots even

395
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:40,664
he believed it because the Yogi
was an authority in the local area

396
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:45,180
I don't know who
but the person left

397
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:51,620
So what we have to learn
from Hanuman is the zeal

398
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,500
" Ram kaj karne ko tatpar"
(eager to do Ram's work)

399
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,040
What is our work?
My work is sahaj yoga

400
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,390
My work is sahaj yoga
 To raise kundalini

401
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,133
To make people peaceful and lovable
talking about love

402
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:22,590
Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras 
Make them understand

403
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:29,800
Doesn't mean you start giving lecture
Some people started to give so much lecture

404
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,460
I had to tell them to stop
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished

405
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:43,350
Only long lectures
No time for Mother's talk and Aarti

406
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,265
He said he just can't stop

407
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:52,595
He doesn't know why
"How can I fix it?"

408
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:56,085
"You put supari (spice) in your mouth"

409
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,080
Then "How much?"

410
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,940
"It depends on the size of your mouth"

411
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:10,770
"You don't know it even then
how come you talk aobut Sahaja Yoga"

412
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,270
you don't know it even

413
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,820
People like giving lecture

414
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:23,440
Get on a stage and won't leave a mic

415
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,420
Once with mic they cant't leave
It's a new disease

416
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:36,170
So you must understand
why to give lecture

417
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:45,120
There are so many Mother's talk
you can put a tape or video in every program

418
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:57,990
After people can write question on paper 
And ask them to bring it next program

419
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:02,290
If there are someone
who is sick or in trouble

420
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:09,100
Now there is a Yogi
He comes to cure in Calcutta

421
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:16,550
Now he was called to Russia

422
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,892
One person is running like
Hanuman all over to cure

423
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:26,277
You all can cure
All women can do

424
00:44:26,302 --> 00:44:29,684
All men also
But nobody tries

425
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:34,240
By giving lecture how many were cured?

426
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:35,875
I don't know why only one in India

427
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:36,375
don't know what's the matter
 that till now there is only one man in India
 who can cure people

428
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:47,480
In London there are 15~20 people
who can cure and in France also

429
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,822
One should learn working on people
like giving bandhan

430
00:44:53,878 --> 00:45:04,620
No need to invite someone from abroad
Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure

431
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:09,595
How do you work on others
if you can't cure even yourself

432
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:15,635
Everybody has got
all the power to cure anyone

433
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:19,520
Learn to become masters

434
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,490
Instead of inviting someone
They should go out to cure

435
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:30,013
Just have some courage to work
Nothing will happen

436
00:45:30,212 --> 00:45:39,832
By working, you become deeper like
a tree grows deeper as it expands

437
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:48,245
Sahaja Yogis are very much different
from Incarnations

438
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:53,330
They have never worked in society before

439
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:57,760
Nobody had the power for a mass

440
00:45:57,785 --> 00:46:03,645
Only one to one
Like King Janaka to Nachiketa

441
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:12,905
But now you all have it
Just grow it, that's all

442
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:19,790
Cure yourself and others
Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything

443
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:25,510
But still your attention is wondering
What are you running after?

444
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:32,158
You still don't understand it
Sahaja Yoga is just blessing

445
00:46:32,238 --> 00:46:36,510
You won't be in short of anything

446
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:41,910
Just work for sahaja Yoga
Even if you don't work you will be blessed

447
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:48,040
Business or promotion,
this and that

448
00:46:48,065 --> 00:46:54,883
Everyone is blessed and
nothing to give up

449
00:46:54,908 --> 00:47:00,563
Otherwise in time of freedom fight

450
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:06,806
we were tortured
Lied on ice, got electric shocks

451
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:11,335
My parents went to jail
Our house was sold

452
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:19,100
Lived in a hut... had to sacrifice a lot 
And you don't have to do it

453
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,070
But not only recieving
You have to give

454
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:31,408
If one door is open so should be the other one
Only one doesn't work

455
00:47:31,427 --> 00:47:38,136
Everyone reports me
about blessings they got

456
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:46,330
We must see what we have done for others

457
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:58,840
But there are many fights for leadership
It's all mother's play

458
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,990
You will know it when you will fall from there

459
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:09,719
Specially women shouldn't get involved
They fall very soon

460
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:14,710
And men should know 
there is nothing like ministers

461
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:18,345
This is Mother's play
Don't get involved in

462
00:48:18,345 --> 00:48:26,357
Why I call a leader? It's a play
There are no leaders

463
00:48:26,444 --> 00:48:35,100
It's just a test if you have ego 
If you have, you are gone

464
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:41,870
It will be shown immediately
In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed

465
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:46,773
Even if I say something
 it shows on the faces

466
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:54,512
Once some leaders came and
confessed their mistakes

467
00:48:54,568 --> 00:49:04,180
They have more responsibilities to be
better, sweet, humble and loving

468
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,570
and become close and sharing with everyone

469
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:17,640
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama
we must understand what he had showen

470
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:23,592
Only a bit of it would please our Mother

471
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:34,765
He was in exile for a long time in Jungle
Walked barefeet, worked so hard

472
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:38,715
Just to obey his father

473
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:42,725
Now to obey me
you don't need to go into exile

474
00:49:42,725 --> 00:49:48,010
Not barefeet, nor starving nothing
All are there for you

475
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:54,610
But you must know how to cure people
in Sahaja Yoga

476
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:58,090
everything about sahaj yoga

477
00:49:58,117 --> 00:50:02,775
and mostly about love

478
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:10,560
it's nothing but power of love
Everybody will be benefited

479
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:17,090
This is not only for special people

480
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:24,303
This is not only for one country
but for the whole world

481
00:50:24,765 --> 00:50:33,610
Watch how your attention is
If it's disturbed we should correct it

482
00:50:33,687 --> 00:50:40,800
Put the power of spirit in it
Do everything with concentration

483
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:47,443
And devotion and love will
make you deep

484
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:54,333
Otherwise there is lots of rubbish

485
00:50:54,358 --> 00:51:02,259
If you wish to stay like rubbish
you know where it goes at the end

486
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:07,090
If you want to feel you are 
specially good capable of anything

487
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:13,289
First humility, not only towards me 
but everyone

488
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:26,168
Talk humbly with love and show that 
people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga

489
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,765
to spread fragrance everywhere

490
00:51:28,765 --> 00:51:37,370
People will tell me you are wonderful
if you will do it in that way

491
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:42,491
One day you too will be called as
Maryada Purushottama

492
00:51:42,571 --> 00:51:48,552
You are the temple of Rama
so have it within yourself

493
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:54,639
Perform puja to it 
Take care of your self-esteem

494
00:51:55,171 --> 00:52:04,128
Take the benefit of self-realization
inside yourself

495
00:52:04,175 --> 00:52:08,760
You must have respect and devotion to it

496
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:17,058
"Now we are realized" 
"How can we do wrong, we are yogi"

497
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:23,750
Soon you will have blessings
immediately

498
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:29,888
As I am called Rokra devi, you will get
blessing as soon as you assert it

499
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:39,540
Everyone is getting blessed with it
give it back to the world

500
00:52:39,565 --> 00:52:53,275
Shri Rama used all his powers for the
benevolence of people to show the ideal

501
00:52:53,275 --> 00:53:01,175
You will be surprised to achieve so high
when the time comes

502
00:53:01,185 --> 00:53:09,195
You won't have any disease and
all bad habits will be dropped

503
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:17,405
You will eat, talk and watch 
as much as you need

504
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:29,782
You will watch your mind
for introspection

505
00:53:29,814 --> 00:53:40,568
"Where is my mind going?"
"I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it"

506
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:45,366
By doing so 
you will be in meditation

507
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:51,723
Your kundalini will be satisfied 
and give you blessings

508
00:53:51,748 --> 00:53:54,728
You say, 
"Mother what a blessing"

509
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,603
But you have to jump into it
Only then will you know it

510
00:53:59,738 --> 00:54:04,075
Till then you need to work hard

511
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:10,155
Shri Rama was born 
at midnight so let's have puja late

512
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:17,242
Shri Rama Puja is not 
a specially long one

513
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:29,154
As he is in a human form
he is humanity within us

514
00:54:29,406 --> 00:54:41,915
by which we understand our intellect
and our thoughts get changed

515
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:49,210
Shri Rama is that 
Through him we can change our thoughts

516
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:55,380
Our nature can change
Because he is our ideal

517
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:02,801
After achieving his ideals we reach another 
because he was human ideal

518
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:09,030
It is great that God came to this world 
in a human form to became our ideal

519
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:18,835
He has gone through all the hardships
to show us strength to keep Dharma

520
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:23,543
That is Vishwa Dharma 
and the state of yoga

521
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:28,170
May God bless you all
