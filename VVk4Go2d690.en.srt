1
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,178
First, I’ll speak in English language,

2
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,966
because we have so many people from foreign countries,

3
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,498
and especially from Madras (Chennai)

4
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:56,794
and also from Kerala,

5
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:00,683
Hyderabad and Bangalore.

6
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:04,434
All these people have come here,

7
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:07,479
and I don’t know what other people are here,

8
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:13,340
who have come from South

9
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:20,681
and who do not yet understand Hindi language.

10
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:35,287
This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think,

11
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,388
because

12
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:49,875
there is so much –

13
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:55,289
if you read any newspaper in the morning,

14
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,756
such horrible news is there

15
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:07,602
about the people who are trying to create

16
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:15,398
all kinds of violence, corruption

17
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,242
and immoral behaviour.

18
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:28,321
You are surprised how, these
days, it is so full of

19
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:33,883
all these criminalities going round us.

20
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:41,954
This is the time, as if come, for

21
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:47,453
the “Taandav nrutya” (cosmic dance) of Shri Shiva.

22
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:53,716
Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve.

23
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,655
It is His anger, if it starts,

24
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:04,713
throwing wrath on people of this character and this type.

25
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:12,849
I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath.

26
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:17,573
He’s a God who is full of love,

27
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,932
full of tremendous compassion,

28
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:36,485
but also the- another extreme of very destroying character.

29
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,659
He can destroy the whole world.

30
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:48,177
He can finish all the creatures that have been created

31
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:53,053
if He gets into a temper.

32
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,128
You all must be knowing the story,

33
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:06,521
how He went into ecstasy.

34
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:14,439
There was a devil who had taken a form of a child.

35
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,607
And a mother cannot kill the child,

36
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,039
she cannot. And She thought

37
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:30,332
She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath

38
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,157
or anger of Shiva

39
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:40,683
if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.

40
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:52,646
So She withdrew from Her act

41
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:59,965
of sacrificing the child or killing the child

42
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:04,864
and it was Shiva who took over.

43
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:12,502
And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him.

44
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,867
That child was a devil.

45
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,877
And so, He saved the world

46
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:24,750
from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

47
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:28,998
And then He danced with joy.

48
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:34,896
That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.

49
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,864
Many people don’t understand why

50
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,556
He’s standing on top of a little child,

51
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,136
but the reason was this.

52
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:49,011
So, even people may camouflage today

53
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:55,169
as small children, as very innocent people,

54
00:08:55,741 --> 00:09:03,465
as very holy gurus,

55
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,523
Shiva can destroy all of them.

56
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:12,328
This destruction has already started

57
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:17,209
and is going with a full speed, I think, all over,

58
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:21,124
through so many things that are happening:

59
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:27,197
we have got hurricanes,

60
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:32,626
storms, earthquakes,

61
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:35,652
many accidents,

62
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:40,398
and so many destructive things are working out

63
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:45,194
which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation.

64
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,265
But, at the same time,

65
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:53,434
there is another work going on, of the same incarnation:

66
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,347
is the resurrection of the people.

67
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:01,095
Such people can never be hurt,

68
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:04,484
nothing can happen to them.

69
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,103
They’ll be always saved.

70
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,058
Everything will be saved for them

71
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:16,029
because they are under the protection of their Mother.

72
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:22,711
Now the problem is

73
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:29,243
how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people

74
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:35,259
and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution?

75
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,349
Only solution is raising the Kundalini.

76
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,448
If you raise the Kundalini of human beings,

77
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:52,019
who are even very bad and gone cases,

78
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:58,152
either they will be destroyed or they will be saved

79
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:00,765
and they’ll become good people.

80
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,934
They will stop all this

81
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:12,129
horrible things they are thinking and planning in their heads

82
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:17,581
and they’ll become really very, very good people.

83
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:21,637
It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say

84
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:25,734
that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case.

85
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,213
But if Sahaja Yogis meditate

86
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:33,832
and keep themselves in complete peace

87
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:39,580
and also completely surrendered,

88
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:42,596
nothing can happen to them.

89
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,177
They are always protected and you all have an experience

90
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:49,598
of that protection.

91
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:54,386
But first you should have faith in yourself

92
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,576
and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,880
We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

94
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:08,253
mostly from North, South, East and West of India,

95
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,898
and also from other foreign countries.

96
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:16,744
Every country is, today, under the,

97
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,720
we should say, under the control of these negative forces.

98
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:27,615
What we have to do is to make people positive

99
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,076
through Kundalini awakening.

100
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,298
This you all can do.

101
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:34,292
This you can achieve.

102
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,348
For this, you don’t have to do something special.

103
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:45,040
In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it.

104
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:49,589
This is the only thing that is needed today,

105
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:53,413
is to transform people and you all can do it,

106
00:12:54,024 --> 00:13:00,812
all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner.

107
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:06,828
You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people,

108
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,505
get angry with rude people,

109
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:13,632
but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it;

110
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:21,919
so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva,

111
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,303
as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open.

112
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,414
That’s something horrible.

113
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:32,307
We all can do it in a very constructive manner,

114
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,299
extremely in a constructive manner.

115
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:39,545
So what we should do is to, first of all,

116
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:46,276
establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy,

117
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,546
principle of love

118
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:56,021
and principle of Truth, I should say.

119
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:00,870
There are big problems, also,

120
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,674
because people have no idea

121
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:13,128
as to Shiva’s global temperament.

122
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:21,075
For example, I have heard people
quarrelling and fighting over

123
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,853
Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.

124
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:29,847
Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there

125
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,422
for you to rise up to this Shiva principle.

126
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:41,750
Both are not different, one is supplementary for another.

127
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:45,417
But if you go on fighting even on that point,

128
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,235
I can’t understand.

129
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:51,674
You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu.

130
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:59,223
And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle,

131
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,684
 if you have not understood the Vishnu principle –

132
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,805
Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi.

133
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:15,910
She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva.

134
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:21,410
And She rises through the channel

135
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,564
that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process.

136
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:32,828
So how can you do away with one of Them?

137
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,820
One is the road, another is the destination.

138
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,838
So I hope you understand how important it is

139
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,457
that your centers should be corrected,

140
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,626
your road should be alright,

141
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,221
that your Sushumna should be cleared,

142
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,446
because we are “madhyamargis”:

143
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,303
we have to go by the centre,

144
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:03,407
by the central path and we have to have the balance,

145
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:07,192
not to go to the left and not to go to the right.

146
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,971
This balance we must keep

147
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:13,278
and go on moving until you reach

148
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:17,826
your “talu bhaag” (Brahmarandhra) where sits Sadashiva.

149
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:23,471
You can experience it, you can see for yourself.

150
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:27,738
Whatever I am saying, you know it very well.

151
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,532
Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify.

152
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:37,352
Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily,

153
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,941
and you know that, that you now know the only truth.

154
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:49,473
The truth which is absolute.

155
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:55,816
This is also the principle which starts showing results

156
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:59,966
when these two powers meet.

157
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:06,421
It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet,

158
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:12,445
or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle,

159
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,614
then you realize

160
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:22,865
that these two powers are so complimentary

161
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,748
and so much related to each other.

162
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:35,224
There’s no difference, in a way,

163
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,020
between these two powers.

164
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:44,774
And, so, keep your road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean

165
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:47,983
and let the Kundalini pass through it.

166
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:52,007
When the Kundalini will pass through it,

167
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:59,509
you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini

168
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,017
is going through the Vishnu path

169
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:07,374
and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.

170
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:19,138
All of you recognise Shivji, and He is worshiped.

171
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,566
But, you do not know the different aspects of His qualities.

172
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:28,575
That is why, many times you make mistakes.

173
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:34,856
The most important form of  Shivji is bliss and joy.

174
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,847
And this joy is spread everywhere in subtle and subtlest forms.

175
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:48,101
But, until you become spiritually subtle to absorb this,

176
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:52,562
you will neither be able to see this nor understand this.

177
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:55,282
He resides in everything,

178
00:18:55,483 --> 00:19:00,754
He resides in everything

179
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:10,297
and in a way we can say He creates a joyful realm.

180
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:15,625
And when you look around in that realm, you find

181
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:18,850
that you have been transformed into something else.

182
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:23,215
Other people find happiness in different things.

183
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:30,191
Many people find happiness in destroying themselves.

184
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:35,329
By taking to different wrong paths,

185
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:41,856
people think that if we go against the Spirit, we can find happiness.

186
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:48,994
But, the Atma [Spirit], Which is verily Shivji,

187
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:54,409
finds joy in a different way.

188
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,616
And only that can touch our heart.

189
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:06,855
Like, there are a lot of people who are immersed in material things.

190
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,214
Some take to alchohol,  some indulge into sinful activities,

191
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:14,724
they keep doing all wrong things

192
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:18,350
and they think that there is a lot of happiness in that.

193
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,079
But it is not so.

194
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:25,031
 gradually they get destroyed and slowly, they are finished.

195
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:31,383
But, Shivji is the one who comforts us,

196
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,955
He gives us peace and He gives us joy.

197
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,616
And when the Power of Shiva and the Power of Vishnu,

198
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:48,879
– like Kundalini and Sushumna Nadi;

199
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:55,776
when unite with each other, you get the absolute Truth.

200
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,982
absolute Truth.

201
00:20:59,183 --> 00:21:05,339
Such that you cannot, in any way,

202
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,705
refuse to accept this Truth.

203
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:10,161
Because it is the absolute Truth.

204
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:14,402
Which you can feel on your fingertips, on your hands.

205
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:18,823
You will have many types of experiences,

206
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:24,185
by which you will understand that in the absolute Truth

207
00:21:25,688 --> 00:21:29,010
there is not even an iota of untruth.

208
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:36,970
That is known within you; you can know it, understand it.

209
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:40,955
This is the gift given by the Kundalini.

210
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:45,831
This means that the Kundalini, which is the Shakti [Power] of Shiva,

211
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:51,145
when She rises through the central channel,

212
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:56,587
She awakens all the chakras, aligns them in its entirety,

213
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:58,988
and integrates them

214
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:03,547
Who looks after that Shakti [Power]?

215
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:07,230
We can say that Shri Vishnu looks after Her,

216
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:10,833
because She moves in the central path of Vishnu.

217
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,726
And then She reaches the Brahmarandhra,

218
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,345
and appears there.

219
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:21,660
And on reaching there we can understand that

220
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:26,141
Her journey is now complete.

221
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:31,139
So we can see so much cooperation and understanding among them.

222
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:34,169
But, we people are there,

223
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:39,861
now a type of disease has come that everyone is running after money.

224
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:44,126
Running after money has become a very peculier disease.

225
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:47,209
And for that we are willing to do anything,

226
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,455
We take support from anything,

227
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:51,862
Even in Sahaja Yoga people do that.

228
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:56,647
The reason for this is that some sort of defect has crept into us.

229
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:01,491
A lot of negativities have accumulated in us.

230
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:06,742
And these negativities can be cleansed only by Kundalini.

231
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:15,605
But, until you do not become one with the Kundalini,

232
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:19,594
and through meditation if you do not develop It,

233
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:24,507
then you cannot reach that state where,

234
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:28,840
the Power is manifested in you,

235
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:34,404
the Power which is the truth, it is joy giving, peace giving -

236
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:37,523
– a weakness remains in it.

237
00:23:38,143 --> 00:23:41,471
When the Kundalini rises, She cleanses everything.

238
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,859
With the Power of Shivji, everything gets cleansed.

239
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:50,158
But, still some people because of their old habits

240
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:53,359
or because of wrong ideals, suffer a lot.

241
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:00,311
And those people – with whatever that is wrong,

242
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:04,579
whatever bad habits of theirs,

243
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:11,265
even with the slightest temptation they fall from their ascent.

244
00:24:13,004 --> 00:24:17,526
Even if an atom of negativity is left within us,

245
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:20,740
remaining within,

246
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:25,421
We can fall due to that, and get completely destroyed

247
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:30,848
Those who come to the Pujas and meditate,

248
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,967
those people always make progress.

249
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:42,352
If there is no peace, even a tree cannot survive, it cannot grow.

250
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:45,313
Even germination cannot take place.

251
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:49,187
That is why, within you,

252
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:54,063
if you don't have this meditative quality, don't have these ideals,

253
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:56,896
that we will never go towards downfall,

254
00:24:57,097 --> 00:25:00,579
we will not succumb to any bad habits,

255
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,705
then you should attend all the pujas – as many as possible

256
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:08,629
and you should be in meditation.

257
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,086
Because now you have the right to do puja.

258
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:14,239
Everyone doesn’t have the right to do Pujas.

259
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:16,236
Anyone and everyone goes to do puja.

260
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:19,077
But when there is no connection,

261
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:22,192
then how can you be authorised to do a puja?

262
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:24,611
But many people think-

263
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:28,509
go to this temple or that temple; go to this guru or that guru.

264
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:29,835
Nothing comes out of that.

265
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:31,741
You are your own guru,

266
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:35,701
and only you can introspect and think, ’what is the problem in me’?

267
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:42,481
’In our heart are we completely accepting Sahaja Yoga or not'?

268
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,292
I have seen a lot of people come into Sahaja Yoga

269
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:50,996
and after reaching a certain height, they fall.

270
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:54,658
The higher they rise, the lower they fall.

271
00:25:55,324 --> 00:25:59,459
The reason is that the hidden tendencies in you,

272
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,570
have somehow become active, without you being aware of it.

273
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,376
That is why you must pay attention

274
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:12,623
– ’hope I am not falling into wrong things’,

275
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:19,969
or ’hope, I am not doing anything wrong which is against Sahaja?

276
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:26,324
or ’have some bad motives arisen in me that

277
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:30,679
I have come to Sahaja with the idea of making money?’

278
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,221
Or ,’I have come into Sahaja Yoga to do something bad?’

279
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,745
Our attention should be towards these things.

280
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:41,422
The best thing is that, whatever activities of Sahaja are there –

281
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:46,510
or however it is possible in Sahaja, like meditation, worship, etc.

282
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:50,879
you should do all that and establish individually

283
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,593
within you, a special type of state

284
00:26:57,987 --> 00:27:01,717
which we call as

285
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:05,299
individuality or as totality.

286
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,857
Once you are established individually,

287
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,582
then you can become a collective person.

288
00:27:09,783 --> 00:27:11,394
Those who do not attend collectivity,

289
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:15,402
they cannot also grow individually.

290
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,235
This I have seen.

291
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:21,505
Only those who attend the collectivity, raise higher.

292
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,009
For some time maybe you’ll get some benefits,

293
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:29,169
like you get some money, or fame or something.

294
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,520
Especially in Sahja Yoga some people have this ambitions –‚

295
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,425
that ’how many people can I control’.

296
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:41,423
Even that also happens, but your personality does not improve.

297
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,046
There is no depth in you and

298
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,030
you are not a Sahaja Yogi of high caliber.

299
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:54,656
Until you are not of high caliber, all your talks are of no use.

300
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,045
Because, who knows when you will fall from the brink

301
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:01,309
and who knows when you will be destroyed completely?

302
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:03,635
That is why we should be cautious

303
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:08,309
and try to achieve high spiritual personality.

304
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,333
There is one more thing you should do.

305
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:15,336
If you have got your Realization today,

306
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,292
then ’tomorrow’ you give Realization to thousands of people.

307
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:19,712
Then your Powers will increase.

308
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,119
If not, whatever little you have achieved, will also be finished.

309
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:29,322
This is a very peculier rule.

310
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:33,639
It cannot be compared with anything else.

311
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:38,248
Like, if one lam enlightened and from that another is enlightened;

312
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,491
even then you cannot say that the

313
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:45,268
light of the first lamp increases –can not say.

314
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,267
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, that if anyone opens his heart

315
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:54,921
and sincerely does Sahaja Yoga

316
00:28:54,993 --> 00:28:58,296
and not only that but gives Realization to others, he shines.

317
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:02,058
Because you have been made a Sahaja Yogi

318
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,336
so that you tranform the entire world.

319
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:11,688
That you create a great wave of transformation in the world

320
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:16,473
and make it a beautiful place.

321
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:22,509
The world should become a new and special world

322
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:27,239
this should be one of your pure desires.

323
00:29:28,036 --> 00:29:32,071
Once you have this pure desire, your Kundalini becomes activated.

324
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,162
I have seen that even very simple, normal people,

325
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:38,516
when they narrate their experiences, I am surprised-

326
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:41,277
how did such a thing happen to them?

327
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:44,627
How did they give such a suggestion?

328
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,400
In Sahaja Yoga also there are some people, who come for power.

329
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,520
Some come for money.

330
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,673
With all these things, the personality of a person is not developed.

331
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,363
There is no glow in their personality.

332
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:05,547
Because, the light that you have received;

333
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,728
till the time you do not  share it with others;

334
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:13,617
and within yourself also if you will not be enlightened,

335
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:17,033
till then no effort will have any success.

336
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:21,805
Which is to say that our only work is to change the world;

337
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:23,511
to transform the world.

338
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:27,654
We have to build a special world and you are special people.

339
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:32,713
When you begin to understand how important you are,

340
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:37,952
then with that understanding, you will make your life beautiful.

341
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:43,426
Have spoken in English,

342
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:46,567
and spoken in Hindi.

343
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:50,389
There are so many Maharashtrian’s here

344
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,397
that I should speak in Marathi too.

345
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:55,364
But it is My wish

346
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:59,820
that all the Sahaja Yogis who live in Maharashtra

347
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:02,465
should at least learn the Hindi language,

348
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,032
as it is our National language.

349
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:11,896
We should love and be ready, if required be ready

350
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:14,479
to sacrifice anything for our Nation.

351
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,198
People were always ready to do that.

352
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,315
This was the speciality of Maharashtra.

353
00:31:18,516 --> 00:31:21,088
Now the Maharashtra state, which I see,

354
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:24,895
I don’t understand, where those people have gone.

355
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:28,482
They took to the Gods and started doing their puja.

356
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:34,626
After this was done and didn’t work out, they used another way;

357
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:37,356
they have started going to this guru, that guru,

358
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:41,316
then going to temples and all that.

359
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:44,970
We should see what these people have achieved by doing this

360
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:48,442
what was their benefit,

361
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:51,760
and what you have achieved by doing Sahaja Yoga.

362
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:53,990
So now just leave and forget everything

363
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:58,584
and dedicate sincerely to yourselves

364
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:03,238
and make your Kundalini to be in perfect state

365
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:07,033
and through that you can do a tremendous work.

366
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:13,325
Now, If I say, I am by birth Maharashtrian,

367
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:17,411
it is very sad for Me to see

368
00:32:17,955 --> 00:32:20,425
that the Sahaja Yoga has spread in north India,

369
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:24,787
though I have hardly made any effort there,

370
00:32:24,988 --> 00:32:29,061
but it has spread like fire in north India,

371
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:33,505
which is very surprising.

372
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:37,662
Why it has not worked out in Maharashtra?

373
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:41,656
Sahaja Yoga has spread in all big and small villages of Maharashtra.

374
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:47,565
One day a man had come to work at My place.

375
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:50,864
He bowed down to Me and did namaskar

376
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,766
 so I asked him, “What happened?”

377
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:57,752
He told Me: „Mataji Your photo is in every big and small villages,

378
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:01,568
Your disciples are there in all our villages”.

379
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:04,274
„How can that be?” - I asked.

380
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:08,374
All of them say: "we are Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell us anything else".

381
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:12,059
I was wondering how this happened and with whose blessings?

382
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:16,712
As I was thinking nothing would work in this country,

383
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,835
as too many people are superficial.

384
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:22,496
But people of Maharashtra are very deep-rooted,

385
00:33:22,697 --> 00:33:25,511
the knowledge they have about everything is  deep-rooted,

386
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,497
but, I don’t know where it has gone.

387
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:30,091
I have always said

388
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:34,080
that Sahaja Yogis should come in the collective minimum of minimum,

389
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:38,312
and maximum of maximum give Realization to thousands of people.

390
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:40,148
Every day we should only think

391
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:43,182
how many people did we give Realization to,

392
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:45,725
how many people

393
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:50,995
did we awaken the Kundalini to.

394
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:55,955
You have a job to save the entire world,

395
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:59,844
as the Kundalini of the world is established in Maharashtra,

396
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:02,042
and we have eight Ganeshas in Maharashtra,

397
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:06,208
and three and a half Goddesses are manifested here.

398
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:09,493
All the arrangements are done here,

399
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:13,257
but, surprisingly, people do not take interest in that.

400
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,802
People are so false, pretending to be what they are not,

401
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:22,081
and waste time doing  mundane things.

402
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:27,299
Instead of doing this, try to achieve the truth.

403
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,452
Pay attention to the truth.

404
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:33,082
Under any mythical ideea, if you try to do something good

405
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,293
what are you going to achieve?

406
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:37,441
If you don't change from within,

407
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,275
you cannot achieve anything.

408
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:47,239
The innate growth should be so deep and mature,

409
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,974
that its fragrance should spread all over the world.

410
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:56,526
Insted of that we get involved in petty things

411
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,825
and fight among ourselves.

412
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,652
This all should stop.

413
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:04,351
Instead of that, I see

414
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:08,189
that Yuva Shakti activities are very good.

415
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:15,741
Due to yuvashakti the whole of Maharashtra will change.

416
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:20,199
People who are highly placed,

417
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,950
who are sitting in high positions,

418
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:28,613
are very arrogant, terribly arrogant.

419
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:32,270
It is very surprising from where they have got this arrogance.

420
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:38,033
I fail to understand the reason for this arrogance.

421
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,416
Because of this arrogance,

422
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:46,291
we were not able to do any special Sahaja Yoga work in Maharashtra.

423
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:51,688
So, it should be your aim to spread Sahaja Yoga

424
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:55,544
and to establish people in Sahaja Yoga.

425
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:59,318
Today is a very special day, the day of Shivratri.

426
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,328
We should all take a pledge,

427
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:05,881
and pledge to Shri Shiva to get His blessings.

428
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:09,022
Due to His bliss in your heart,

429
00:36:09,223 --> 00:36:13,259
you will be surprised

430
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,297
there will be flow of joy and flow of love.

431
00:36:17,498 --> 00:36:22,084
First of all, you get ready for that.

432
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:25,968
You have light in our heart.

433
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:29,082
This light if we do not spread,

434
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:33,435
then we will be in darkness, along with others.

435
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,018
So, we should all decide

436
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:43,954
that we will give Realization to at least 100 people till next year.

437
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:47,010
I know that if we go and speak to people about Sahaja Yoga,

438
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:49,842
they won't agree, that is the issue.

439
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:53,202
They think are over smart but don't have any common sense.

440
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:56,443
But still if you explain them

441
00:36:56,644 --> 00:37:00,087
what you have gained and what you have benefitted,

442
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,572
what you achieved and what you are still to achieve,

443
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:07,053
then people may start believing you.

444
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:08,951
They will trust that

445
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:14,341
and they will gradually stop their wrong doings.

446
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,434
This is our main responsibility.

447
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:23,333
For this, you all have to think properly and should act accordingly.

448
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:24,957
If this does not happen

449
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:28,173
then I am not sure in what condition will be Maharashtra.

450
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:32,278
Shivaji Maharaj has worked so hard for this state.

451
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:37,109
There have been many saints in Maharashtra, unlike anywhere else,

452
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,384
who have shed their blood

453
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,334
for this great and holy land!

454
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:45,481
That is why it is called Maharashtra.

455
00:37:45,656 --> 00:37:49,375
You should not fight for petty things,

456
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:51,702
you should not live like petty people.

457
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:55,817
There is no point, because you people are Realized souls now.

458
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:59,492
Earlier, there were no Realized souls, but they were land soldiers.

459
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:01,630
I fail to understand this,

460
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:05,943
where these people have gone, the people from the royal community.

461
00:38:06,144 --> 00:38:08,111
People who never used to touch alcohol,

462
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:11,393
are now drinking senselessly.

463
00:38:11,594 --> 00:38:14,818
Under this nonsense they are destroying themselves

464
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:18,041
and are going away from Shiva.

465
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:26,080
That is why people have said that God has taken lots of effort.

466
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:29,107
Everything is done,

467
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:33,677
but if you are facing the wrong direction then how it will work?

468
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,921
Now you should explain it to people,

469
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:40,325
from all your heart,

470
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:46,283
and this is what I am telling you, in this Shiva puja.

471
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:48,798
If Shiva gets angry,

472
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,481
then He will be angry on Maharashtra first,

473
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:55,469
as this is a special place for Him.

474
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,478
You know how much people believe in Shiva,

475
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,250
and you know whom Shri Shiva is worshiping first.

476
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:06,286
For everybody in Maharashtra the first worshipped deity

477
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:07,815
is Shri Ganesha.

478
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:11,549
And if He gets disturbed then I am not sure what will happen.

479
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,336
I don’t know when all this iniquity started in Maharashtra,

480
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:23,950
and I am seeing what people are doing with Shri Ganesha’s idol.

481
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:26,210
He is Shri Ganesha -

482
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:30,624
if you insult Him, if you disrespect Him,

483
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:34,552
then what will happen to you and who will save you?.

484
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:40,899
So, you need to tell the people that they should get Realization

485
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:43,206
and they should join Sahaja Yoga,

486
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,705
and get their Kundalini awakened.

487
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:47,792
Everybody is aware of it,

488
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:50,247
right from Marchrindra Nath to Gorakh Nath,

489
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,465
everyone has worked on it.

490
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:54,719
Everyone has knowledge about it,

491
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:57,963
and everybody knows that Kundalini has to be awakened.

492
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,943
And in Marathi there are books about Kundalini,

493
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:04,972
but the knowledge of books has remained within the books.

494
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:08,446
But you should clearly explain about it to people:

495
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:13,594
„Look, this is the time for you to get your resurection”.

496
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:17,413
You should get ready for it.

497
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:21,660
On this auspicious occasion of Shivratri,

498
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:24,980
we should all decide

499
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:30,076
that we will spread Sahaja Yoga in tremendous way.

500
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:35,222
That is of utmost importance and nothing is beyond it in our life.

501
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:38,517
All your work will be taken care of,

502
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,039
if you practice Sahaja Yoga.

503
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,420
You should meditate.

504
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:46,639
If you don't meditate what is the point in being in Sahaja Yoga?

505
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,394
Just coming here, singing and all and then going away,

506
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:54,116
what is the meaning of it?

507
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:59,867
The main thing is you should feel the Self within,

508
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:02,057
the transformation in your personality.

509
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:06,491
That will make you feel so happy

510
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,643
and so proud of yourself.

511
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:12,557
You will feel: „What we could do now?

512
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:16,643
It is a very huge task, which should be done by you.

513
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:21,833
On this auspicious occasion I am telling you,

514
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:24,546
if you want to please Shri Shiva,

515
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:27,906
you give Realization to a lot of people.

516
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:31,096
It means Kundalini is His Shakti.

517
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:34,120
So you should awaken their Kundalini,

518
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:38,003
instead of wasting time unnecessarily on unimportant things.

519
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,126
So have your attention on Kundalini awakening.

520
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:44,015
By doing this, you will change the Maharashtra completely.

521
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:48,709
There are few people who are creating problems,

522
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:50,684
but they will get destroyed.

523
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,183
First of all, you should give realization to others,

524
00:41:53,384 --> 00:41:59,195
it is important to give it to as many people as possible.

525
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:01,471
This is your duty.

526
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:04,467
Now, this is Shri Shiva puja,

527
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:06,423
so during his Puja,

528
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:10,142
establish Shri Shiva in your heart,

529
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:13,277
so that you will never have problems.

530
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:15,950
You have to keep Shri Shiva in your heart,

531
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,976
so that when the kundalini is awakened,

532
00:42:19,177 --> 00:42:22,093
you become one with Him.

533
00:42:22,294 --> 00:42:27,564
This transformation takes place because of the light of Shri Shiva,

534
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,544
as He is the Spirit.

535
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:33,491
He is the reflection of Atma in our heart.

536
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:37,769
So, in this state of reflection,

537
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,597
you look in your heart, asking yourself:

538
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:44,492
"Why are you lying and making a fool of yourself?".

539
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:47,506
introspect youeself from within,

540
00:42:47,707 --> 00:42:52,217
I have tried explaining this to people - they just don’t understand.

541
00:42:52,418 --> 00:42:56,646
They say: "Mother, we heard this lecture today, other another day".

542
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,955
Listening my lectures won’t help you.

543
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:01,587
If you want to help yourself,

544
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:06,042
you will have to establish in Sahaja Yoga with full dedication.

545
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:11,184
This is My request to you all, a request with all My love.

546
00:43:11,385 --> 00:43:14,686
May God bless you all.
