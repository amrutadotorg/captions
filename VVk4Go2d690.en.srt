1
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,154
First, I’ll speak in English language,

2
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:49,076
because we have so many people from foreign countries,

3
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:51,482
and especially from Madras (Chennai)

4
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:56,701
and also from Kerala,

5
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:01,318
Hyderabad and Bangalore.

6
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,341
All these people have come here,

7
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,622
and I don’t know what other people are here,

8
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:13,247
who have come from South

9
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:20,588
and who do not yet understand Hindi language.

10
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:35,665
This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think,

11
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:39,295
because

12
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:49,782
there is so much –

13
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:55,196
if you read any newspaper in the morning,

14
00:04:55,397 --> 00:05:01,766
such horrible news is there

15
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:07,789
about the people who are trying to create

16
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:15,305
all kinds of violence, corruption

17
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:20,149
and immoral behaviour.

18
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:28,662
You are surprised how, these
days, it is so full of

19
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:33,790
all these criminalities going round us.

20
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:41,861
This is the time, as if come, for

21
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:48,353
the “Taandav nrtya” (cosmic dance) of Shri Shiva.

22
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:54,048
Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve.

23
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:59,267
It is His anger, if it starts,

24
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:05,751
throwing wrath on people of this character and this type.

25
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:12,756
I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath.

26
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:18,414
He’s a God who is full of love,

27
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:24,000
full of tremendous compassion,

28
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:37,363
but also the- another extreme of very destroying character.

29
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,168
He can destroy the whole world.

30
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:49,494
He can finish all the creatures that have been created

31
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:54,609
if He gets into a temper.

32
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,470
You all must be knowing the story,

33
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:07,827
how He went into ecstasy.

34
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:14,346
There was a devil who had taken a form of a child.

35
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,948
And a mother cannot kill the child,

36
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,946
she cannot. And She thought

37
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:31,646
She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath

38
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:35,841
or anger of Shiva

39
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:41,833
if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.

40
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:53,546
So She withdrew from Her act

41
00:07:53,747 --> 00:08:01,093
of sacrificing the child or killing the child

42
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:06,101
and it was Shiva who took over.

43
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:12,899
And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him.

44
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,876
That child was a devil.

45
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:20,767
And so, He saved the world

46
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:25,876
from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

47
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:29,759
And then He danced with joy.

48
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,069
That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.

49
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:39,034
Many people don’t understand why

50
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,339
He’s standing on top of a little child,

51
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,777
but the reason was this.

52
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:49,621
So, even people may camouflage today

53
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:55,504
as small children, as very innocent people,

54
00:08:55,705 --> 00:09:04,925
as very holy gurus,

55
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:09,325
Shiva can destroy all of them.

56
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:13,434
This destruction has already started

57
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:18,418
and is going with a full speed, I think, all over,

58
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:21,731
through so many things that are happening:

59
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:29,126
we have got hurricanes,

60
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:33,899
storms, earthquakes,

61
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,594
many accidents,

62
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:40,852
and so many destructive things are working out

63
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:46,274
which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation.

64
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:49,032
But, at the same time,

65
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:54,196
there is another work going on, of the same incarnation:

66
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:58,165
is the resurrection of the people.

67
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:01,845
Such people can never be hurt,

68
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:05,118
nothing can happen to them.

69
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:07,712
They’ll be always saved.

70
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:10,431
Everything will be saved for them

71
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:15,936
because they are under the protection of their Mother.

72
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:22,931
Now the problem is

73
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:29,150
how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people

74
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:36,374
and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution?

75
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:42,895
Only solution is raising the Kundalini.

76
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:47,747
If you raise the Kundalini of human beings,

77
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:52,364
who are even very bad and gone cases,

78
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:58,192
either they will be destroyed or they will be saved

79
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:01,872
and they’ll become good people.

80
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:10,083
They will stop all this horrible things they are thinking

81
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,786
and planning in their heads

82
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:18,325
and they’ll become really very, very good people.

83
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,544
It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say

84
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:26,489
that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case.

85
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,544
But if Sahaja Yogis meditate

86
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:34,325
and keep themselves in complete peace

87
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:40,278
and also completely surrendered,

88
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:44,106
nothing can happen to them.

89
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:48,231
They are always protected and you all have an experience

90
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:50,754
of that protection.

91
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:54,942
But first you should have faith in yourself

92
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:59,762
and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:04,028
We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

94
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:08,497
mostly from North, South, East and West of India,

95
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:11,950
and also from other foreign countries.

96
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:18,224
Every country is, today, under the,

97
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:22,622
we should say, under the control of these negative forces.

98
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:28,083
What we have to do is to make people positive

99
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:32,755
through Kundalini awakening. This you all can do.

100
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:34,956
This you can achieve.

101
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:39,839
For this, you don’t have to do something special.

102
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,183
In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it.

103
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:49,324
This is the only thing that is needed today,

104
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:53,785
is to transform people and you all can do it,

105
00:12:53,986 --> 00:13:01,714
all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner.

106
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:07,222
You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people,

107
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:09,683
get angry with rude people,

108
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:14,347
but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it;

109
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:21,873
so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva,

110
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:25,998
as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open.

111
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,154
That’s something horrible.

112
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:32,717
We all can do it in a very constructive manner,

113
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:35,889
extremely in a constructive manner.

114
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,647
So what we should do is to, first of all,

115
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:49,546
establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy,

116
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,976
principle of love

117
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:57,591
and principle of Truth, I should say.

118
00:13:57,982 --> 00:14:01,437
There are big problems, also,

119
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:05,281
because people have no idea

120
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:13,122
as to Shiva’s global temperament.

121
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:21,267
For example, I have heard people
quarrelling and fighting over

122
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:26,053
Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.

123
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:30,665
Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there

124
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:36,116
for you to rise up to this Shiva principle.

125
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:42,634
Both are not different, one is supplementary for another.

126
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:45,657
But if you go on fighting even on that point,

127
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:48,337
I can’t understand.

128
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:53,103
You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu.

129
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:59,353
And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle,

130
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:04,916
 if you have not understood the Vishnu principle –

131
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:10,799
Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi.

132
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,041
She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva.

133
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:21,533
And She rises through the channel

134
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:27,728
that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process.

135
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,439
So how can you do away with one of Them?

136
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,056
One is the road, another is the destination.

137
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:42,244
So I hope you understand how important it is

138
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:45,807
that your centers should be corrected,

139
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:49,182
your road should be alright,

140
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,354
that your Sushumna should be cleared,

141
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,971
because we are “madhyamargis”:

142
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:59,159
we have to go by the centre,

143
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,815
by the central path and we have to have the balance,

144
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:07,956
not to go to the left and not to go to the right.

145
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:10,878
This balance we must keep

146
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:13,620
and go on moving until you reach

147
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:19,000
your “talu bhaag” (Brahmarandhra) where sits Sadashiva.

148
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:24,130
You can experience it, you
can see for yourself.

149
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,950
Whatever I am saying, you know it very well.

150
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:33,809
Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify.

151
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,856
Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily,

152
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:44,900
and you know that, that you now know the only truth.

153
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:50,239
The truth which is absolute.

154
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,958
This is also the principle which starts showing results

155
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:01,393
when these two powers meet.

156
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,033
It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet,

157
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:12,760
or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle,

158
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:16,908
then you realize

159
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:23,580
that these two powers are so complimentary

160
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:31,398
and so much related to each other.

161
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:36,075
There’s no difference, in a way,

162
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,463
between these two powers.

163
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:41,390
And, so, keep your

164
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:45,072
road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean

165
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:49,088
and let the Kundalini pass through it.

166
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:52,557
When the Kundalini will pass through it,

167
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:59,416
you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini

168
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:01,924
is going through the Vishnu path

169
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:07,281
and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.
