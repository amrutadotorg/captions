00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:42.180
Merry Christmas and all the blessings for
the next year.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:01:01.280
Today we are 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:03:40.900
not going to 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:04:00.430
have 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:06:20.629
a very long puja, but there are certain things
which we have to understand from the life

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:22.360
of Christ.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:40.319
Christ was born in a very poor conditions,
just to show that spirituality can live in

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:47.379
any circumstances and under any problems.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:52.620
And He had to face so much opposition from
His own clan.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.850
He was born in a Jew family and that time
the Jews would not accept Him.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.729
But they did not kill Him, that's the main
point, we should understand.

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.349
They did not kill Him.

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.020
Under no law a multitude can kill.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:22.600
Is the judge, who was a Roman judge from the
Roman Empire who actually ordered His death.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:33.310
It is very difficult to follow His life because
He was absolutely a Divine personality, absolutely.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:39.990
And that's why He - whatever rules and regulations
He has passed for the Christians are really

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.820
very difficult to follow, very difficult.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.729
I don't think very few people are even able
to follow His life.

00:07:48.729 --> 00:08:01.039
It's very difficult because He said that if
you commit any adultery with your eyes, you

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.680
better take out.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.419
You cut your hand if you do any crime with
it.

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:13.330
For Him, the crime was also a very subtle
thing.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.479
Turn your left cheek if somebody slaps you
on the right cheek.

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:24.729
To follow this kind of a difficult, very,
very difficult thing was impossible.

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:31.379
And also He said that you have to do it, not
others.

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:34.600
He lived for such a short time.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.620
He visited India and stayed here.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:44.540
I've read a book about it and I was surprised
that in the Puranas, is written very clearly

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.860
in Sanskrit language, which perhaps the writer
didn't understand, and where Shalivanha, My

00:08:49.860 --> 00:09:01.140
forefathers, he met Him, and he said to Him
that what is Your name?

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:08.459
He said, "My name is Issa Massih", and I have
come to this country because My country is

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:09.850
full of melechas.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:17.440
Melecha means Mal ich, those have only tendencies
toward collecting filth.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.529
So he said, "But what are you doing here?

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:26.510
You go back to your own country and teach
them the "Nirmala Param Tatwam."

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.000
It's very surprisingly; he used these words
so clearly.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.890
So the whole thing was printed in Sanskrit.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.330
Perhaps the writer never understood what was
in Sanskrit language.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:42.640
And then he said, "It is - You can only go
and reform them and You can clear them."

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:50.610
But look at it, He tried to do the good and
people crucified him.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:56.910
If you see the Christian religion now, you
don't know what to say about it.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:02.940
They have been always opposing Sahaja Yoga
and also they have never tried to understand

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:08.560
that Christ has said that I will send you
the Holy Ghost.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.350
Also, some Sahaja Yogis who are supposed to
be coming from Christian conditionings stick

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.350
to that.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.350
Now no more.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.350
There is no Christ.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.990
Of course, we accept that it was very important
for Him to come on this Earth and to help

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.990
us out.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:29.529
The steps on which you are, you have to leave
that step to go out to the higher stage.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.850
That doesn't mean you should not worship Christ.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:39.110
You should worship, but it is not the way
some people are still very much fond of sticking

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.149
on to it.

00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:56.190
while He is the one who prepared you for Sahaja
Yoga.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.370
I don't know what you can adapt from His life.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:07.770
He was the greatest Sahaja Yogi, but He had
so many powers, which are difficult for human

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.730
beings to have.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:21.630
But His sacrifices, His adjustments, acceptance
of whatever was told to Him, He accepted.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:28.050
His love for His Mother and on the cross He
said, "Behold the Mother!", He just said,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.709
"Behold the Mother."

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:37.000
Whatever it is, we have to know also that
the Bible is not completely representing Christ,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.110
as it has happened with every book.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:50.050
So, there are problems and, as in every religion,
people have gone astray from their right path,

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:56.040
and are spoiling the name of the people who
have been Divine and who started those religions.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.029
Also is happened in the Christian nation.

00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:05.680
Just the opposite of what Christ has said,
they are doing.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:13.610
For us, one has to realize that He came on
this Earth to open our Agnya chakra, which

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.829
is a very difficult thing.

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:19.300
Sahasrara is not difficult as Agnya.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:28.570
Agnya chakra is a very constricted chakra
on which He resides.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:36.270
And He has said, "You have to forgive yourself
and forgive others."

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:42.980
This is the mantra of the Agnya chakra.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:49.340
That is in the Beejakshara we call it "Ham
Sham."

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.009
Sham is to forgive others.

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:53.670
Ham is to forgive yourself.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:00.720
These are the two Beejaksharas are used for
Agnya chakra opening.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.270
To open the Agnya chakra best is to go into
thoughtless awareness.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.839
To be in thoughtless awareness, Agnya can
open.

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:17.029
But Agnya, if it is closed, it can be very
dangerous, very dangerous, and can harm you

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:18.880
or harm others.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:25.390
Sometimes, people who are possessed also get
those possessions in their Agnya chakra and

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:35.089
they'll start acting according to the mutation
of these horrible, evil forces within them.

00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:41.769
As a result, these evil forces take over and
we don't know why such a person is behaving

00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:43.120
in this manner.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.769
Now, as we know that in America they have
been doing lots of research, this this genes.

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:54.240
They're talking about so many things, which
they never talked about.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:02.709
Despite that, all the horrible, terrible diseases
are coming back with vengeance.

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:04.780
They can't understand why it is happening.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:11.230
With all this research, with all this work,
people are getting very sick and it is beyond

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.550
them to understand why these things are happening.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:21.379
The main thing is, you have to be under the
protection of spirituality, under the protection

00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:26.300
of morality, under the protection of Divine
Laws.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:33.230
If you're not under that protection, you can
get caught up into anything.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:39.269
America especially, I find, is gone really
amuck as far as religion is concerned.

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:44.480
They have all kinds of religions, they have
even religions of the devil, religions of

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480
the witchcraft.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.399
Every sort of religion they have.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:55.019
Though they have advanced so much in science,
they are living in terror all the time.

00:14:55.019 --> 00:15:04.420
Firstly, one must accept, that morality is
what Christ has taught us, of a very deep

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.860
essential nature, very deep.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.529
He said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:13.050
Even in the eyes, there should not be adultery.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.209
You look at one woman, all right.

00:15:16.209 --> 00:15:21.170
Second time, if you look at that woman, then
you are adulterous.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:27.350
Such strict rules he has passed about his
own idea of a moral personality.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:37.260
Now, as you are Sahaja Yogis, you are already
quite equipped, you are quite equipped and

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.580
you can follow His principles easily than
other people can.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:48.660
But still, some things I have to tell you,
as Christ has said that I will tolerate everything

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:56.890
against Me, but nothing against the Holy Ghost.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.650
It's very remarkable thing to say.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.899
He's the Ocean of Forgiveness, and there He
says, "Everything I'll tolerate, but nothing

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:08.880
against the Holy Ghost."

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:19.540
So many things are happening, So many things
are happening, which amazes people.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:27.959
For example, here only, in Ganapatipule, there
was one funny fellow who came up with some

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:31.779
sort of a opposition to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:31.779 --> 00:16:42.009
And he got hold of the village man called
as the Mamlatdar, means he's an officer and

00:16:42.009 --> 00:16:46.339
both of them combined together started troubling
us.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:51.100
Just before our coming ten days, this Mamlatdar
was suspended.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.459
Nobody could understand.

00:16:52.459 --> 00:16:55.459
How was he suspended suddenly?

00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:56.459
How?

00:16:56.459 --> 00:16:57.459
What happened?

00:16:57.459 --> 00:17:03.759
Like that - is this is Christ, is His work,
Ganesha's work.

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:08.220
Left and right, so many people - I, I am not
bothered about it.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.160
I don't want anybody to be destroyed.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:18.170
But it is They, who are trying to destroy
all those who come in the way of Sahaja Yoga

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.819
and it is very amazing how things are happening
and how it is working out.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:28.840
So we should have no fear at all, if people
oppose us, they try to do anything.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:35.060
Suddenly, you'll find some solution will come
out and you'll be amazed at it.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:40.570
So many things happen like that and have been
happening all over and I have so many letters

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:48.780
from people saying how they have been helped
by our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.810
I don't have to tell them, they know their
job very well.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:18:02.300
But as Sahaja Yogis, what should we have as
our code of conduct?

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.760
It's very important, as they call "Acharsahita."

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:14.760
The first thing in today's modern Sahaja Yoga,
you have to know that you have to recognize

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.140
Me.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.430
That is very important.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:26.120
Very humbly, I have to tell you - you have
to recognize Me and you have to respect Me

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.740
and love Me.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:40.270
If in these words, if I can explain to you,
that you cannot have a double life.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.400
You cannot show love and another side you
try to trouble Me.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:56.410
First thing is that so far there has been
no en-mass realization, no en-mass realization

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:01.150
and when there is no en-mass realization,
we cannot blame the people if they did not

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:07.930
recognize these incarnations, because without
realization, how can they recognize?

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:17.530
But after en-mass realization, if you do not
recognize, then it's a serious thing.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:24.950
You should not be addicted to your previous
nonsensical stuff that you had.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:31.080
In the same, same like some, there are Hindus,
if I tell them that now finish with all these

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:39.380
temples and this fasting and all those brahmic
nonsense, they don't like it.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.380
You have to.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.120
Now you have become saints.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.540
For saints, there is no caste, no community,
no race.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.310
Anyway, and you tell to anyone, they don't
like it.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.880
If you tell it to Jains, they won't like.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.670
If you tell it to Buddhists, they won't like.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.600
They just want to stick on to the old style
which their forefather's, their forefather's,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.250
forefathers have been doing so far.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:11.680
So recognition only mean, doesn't mean that
you recognize Me as Adi Shakti, but recognition

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:26.680
means that in every part of your life, you
should know that I am with you.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.260
Disciplining in Sahaja Yoga has to be automatic.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:38.780
I don't have to tell you about disciplining,
but it doesn't work out, then I have to tell

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.780
you.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:45.020
The first discipline, is that you have to
recognize Me and respect Me.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:57.280
Then the second discipline, is you have to
learn how to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:03.930
Think of Christ, if He is sitting here, how
would He behave towards Me or He would behave

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:09.210
towards others who are here.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:14.570
Very difficult for Him to accept all, any
kind of nonsense from anyone.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.520
He would not tolerate.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.260
I don't mind many things, I say, "All right.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.100
Gradually it will be solved.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.950
Things will be all right."

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:30.390
But what I find, that still there are so many
Sahaja Yogis who don't really realize the

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:35.270
responsibility that they have.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.830
He carried the cross.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.540
In Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to carry cross.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:47.660
You have to wear only garlands, but you must
be worthy of garlands.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.520
Nobody has to suffer.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.930
Everything is made very well for them, paved
with gold as they say, but only thing you

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:03.080
should know, how to walk on them.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:10.480
So the second point, as I said, that you should
not have a double personality.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.790
Single dedication.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:18.590
You need not be twenty-four hours in it, you
have your own families, your own children,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.730
you have own your life.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:28.080
With that, you have to be all the time connected,
but not to get so much involved, that you

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.450
harm the collectivity of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:40.600
Your relations - brothers, sisters, mother,
father, they're all right, but your main responsibility

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600
is Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.820
Instead of that, you get involved into these
things, you will definitely harm the collectivity

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:53.730
of Sahaja Yoga and create a politics out of
it.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:23:01.270
The second discipline, is that your relationship
is only with Sahaja Yogis and with nobody

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.600
else.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.030
This is very important.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:14.530
This is what I have to tell you very clearly
that nobody is important but Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:20.450
Of course, you have to meet others, you have
to talk to others, you have to deal with them,

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:26.860
you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga, that
is there, no doubt.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.020
But, you cannot let down a Sahaja Yogi.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:39.270
Among yourself if you have differences, sort
them out and when you are outside, then you

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.200
should appear as one.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.830
If you know the truth, there should be no
differences.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.730
Why should there be differences?

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.550
If there are differences, then you should
find out that something is wrong with you,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:57.860
definitely, and what is, is wrong is, that
you are self-centered or you're worried about

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:05.370
something, which is, which is not Sahaja.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.540
Even to follow my example may be difficult.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:20.470
Now I have My children and My grandchildren,
I never telephone to them, never.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:27.001
As it is, I never telephone to them.

00:24:27.001 --> 00:24:28.001
I am never bothered.

00:24:28.001 --> 00:24:31.190
I see my husband so much worried about them,
always telephones them.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.360
I never.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.100
Firstly, I know they are all right.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:48.900
Firstly, I know I've done my duty, and I'm
not going to waste My life only on My children

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:57.840
or on My husband or on My family because My
family is the whole universe.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.780
So you have to expand.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.201
Sahaja Yogis have to expand themselves.

00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:10.030
If they're just interested in their own family,
in their own children, in their own properties,

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:13.060
is going to be difficult.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.830
So this self-centeredness has to go.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:24.760
This self-centeredness has to go completely
and you have to have a very wider vision of

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:31.880
life.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:53.901
This is a very big compulsion for us, as Sahaja
Yogis that we belong to the family of the

00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:55.380
universe.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:01.450
So, just like in the marriages now.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:08.400
We started saying, "I don't like, I don't
want to marry an Indian."

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.410
Some Indians say, "I don't want to marry a
foreigner."

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:18.100
If you are so small-minded, you should not
ask for marriage.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:26.880
You should not ask me that I should marry
you because we have to transcend completely,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:34.240
all these petty ideas about our own religion,
about our own race, about our own country.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.270
If you cannot do it, you are not a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:44.150
From your heart, you must expand.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.380
That is very important.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:57.620
Thus, the problem in India is of, say, caste
system, which is - I can't understand.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:04.780
I've told hundred times that in the Gita,
it's described that in everybody resides the

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.780
spirit.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.940
So how can you have caste?

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.950
But you can have according to your aptitude,
that's different.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:16.420
But you cannot have caste according to birth.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:23.230
There's so many examples to prove that, but
in India we have this curse of caste system.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:27.660
And in the West, is even worse, is the racialism.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.790
It is such a horrible thing called racialism.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:39.940
For example, I went to Romania and I saw so
many Gypsies there.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.850
They're treated just like dogs.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.070
So low they were looked upon.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:53.670
These Gypsies are really nice people, nothing
wrong with them.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.400
At least their character is good.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.960
They have certain principle for their women
and they lead a good life of morality.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:10.670
They are collective people, but they are treated
so badly, so shabbily, that even in India,

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.230
I won't find that kind of a thing happening.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.780
Racialism.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:22.830
Now, Romanians have no particular race, as
such.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:32.500
You cannot say they are Germans or English
or Anglo-Saxons, nothing.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.300
I was surprised there more than anywhere else.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.690
Also in England, the same thing.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:46.910
They are treated very badly and these are
people of great art and very loving.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:52.920
And I was surprised that so many came to our
program also.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:59.830
So the attention should be on a wider vision
of life and towards the people who are suffering,

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.150
is very important.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:11.450
You must look after the people who are suffering,
who are in trouble, who need your help, not

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:19.130
to make friends with people who will help
you in money or in any other way but be friendly

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.620
with the people who are downtrodden.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:27.190
We have become Sahaja Yogis to help them to
come up.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:36.950
We have to do something for them and in Vashi
I'm starting a center where the poor people

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.580
will be treated free.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:51.030
Though we are in the middle, we have to help
the people who are not enjoying any benefit

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.040
of life.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.390
We have to take them to Sahaja Yoga, We have
to help them in every way that is possible.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:06.700
Now, you must have noticed that in the wedding
lists, what I have done is to create a balance

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:16.710
between, say, the developing countries and
the developed countries, to make an proper

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.720
exchange.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.960
Then I find there are people who are very
arrogant about it.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.980
Now, English girls are supposed to be Christians,
French girls are supposed to be Christians

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.760
and so many others.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:36.580
Christ, who did so much for the downtrodden,
these people, when they get married, they

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:43.660
try to show off and look down upon people,
they are Sahaja Yogis and now we have turned

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:49.640
down all the Christian girls from England
because for the same reason.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:58.370
A funny type of a superiority complex if you
develop, that's not being Christian at all.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:03.060
And that's why we have to understand, as Sahaja
Yogis, that the one of the principle of Sahaja

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:10.880
Yoga is that you should get over all these
minor things and all these limitations from

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:18.580
which we have been suffering and others have
been suffering.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:27.960
When we come to this collective happening,
we have to understand that people have to

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.110
be collective.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:37.400
Because we should have big palaces where we
can go and meditate or should we have huge

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400
things?

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.270
Not necessary.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.500
To pray and to meditate, any place is all
right.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.160
Anywhere you are there, you can enjoy, you
should enjoy there.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.850
You should not demand things.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:57.540
Like when you come to Ganapatipule, I know
it's not very comfortable.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:05.950
It's not even a three star hotel arrangement,
but you enjoy each other and you love each

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:13.860
other, and the company of every one of you
is the comfort giving.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:26.340
What gives you comfort is the love, affection,
oneness, the unity between yourself.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:31.940
Then you don't care, you don't care what comforts
you have, what happiness you have.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:38.410
This time, suddenly, you know, there were
250 more came than expected, so we had to

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:46.610
put the, these temporary things for you and
you didn't mind.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:50.790
I am very thankful to you for that.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:59.510
So complete tolerance and comfort of the body
is not important - comfort of the spirit.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:07.200
If your body wants comfort, you try to make
it learn to give up that.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:19.590
Try to make your body your slave and not you
the slave of the body.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:24.402
This if you don't try, then in Sahaja Yoga,
you are nowhere because then you will again

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:31.160
say, "I must have a beautiful car, then must
I have a house, then I must have this, must

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.600
have that."

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:41.570
If you care for your body too much, then the
spirit, the light of the spirit goes down.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:50.660
There's no glow on your face and there's no
peace in your mind because, all the time,

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:58.570
you're worried about your body, about your
comforts, about your food, about this, about

00:33:58.570 --> 00:33:59.570
that.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:05.590
You can leave all these things to the Divine.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:11.530
What you have to do to see yourself, that
in your behavior, you should be honest, you

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:15.659
should be spiritual and you should be surrendering.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.819
That's your job.

00:34:17.819 --> 00:34:22.899
You have to see, "Am I surrendering or not?

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:25.030
Am I fully with Sahaja Yoga or not?

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.159
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:30.070
What I should do for Sahaja Yoga?"

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.060
If you don't do this way, the mind will work
the other way round.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.099
It will start thinking, "Oh, this is not good
for my child.

00:34:36.099 --> 00:34:37.550
That's not good.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.000
This is this."

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.529
Once you start thinking what have I to do
for Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.149
What have I to work out for Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:51.940
How I have to spread Sahaja Yoga?, you'll
be surprised your mind will get into the aura

00:34:51.940 --> 00:35:00.119
of spirituality and nobody has to tell you
anything, it will just work automatically.

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:06.839
You have the power, you have everything, you
have the fountain, which has to be opened

00:35:06.839 --> 00:35:08.130
out.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:12.430
So we come to another point that we should
realize what we are.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.850
This is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.590
Christ has said, "I am the Son of God."

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.810
All right.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:29.750
He said it openly, though people crucified
Him for that, but He said it.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:37.190
He said it openly, "I am the Son of God.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.869
Do what you like."

00:35:38.869 --> 00:35:45.920
Which was a fact, which was the truth He was
supposed to say.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:55.240
So now, the Sahaj Yogis have to say, "I am
the son or daughter of Adi Shakti."

00:35:55.240 --> 00:36:02.569
Once you say to yourself that, suddenly you'll
start changing because it's a very big position.

00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:09.630
It's a very anointed position.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:15.859
Once you start saying that, then you'll start
understanding what is your responsibility.

00:36:15.859 --> 00:36:17.869
You'll be amazed.

00:36:17.869 --> 00:36:23.170
Those people have been to wrong gurus, when
they come to Sahaja Yoga, they become extremely

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:30.570
generous and extremely dedicated, extremely
humble because they have suffered so much.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:37.240
Sometimes, those who come directly do not
have that feeling.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:42.450
What you have got, you know better when you
have gone through some ordeals, but if you

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.990
get it Sahaja, then they don't understand.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:55.200
So, we have to also introspect all the time.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.099
The first introspection is that, Am I humble?

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:07.540
Can I 
humble down myself before anyone?

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:13.720
That's very important, but temper is the worst
thing.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.049
Krishna has said, "From the temper, everything
bad starts."

00:37:18.049 --> 00:37:23.869
Temper starts from liver; so you can cure
your liver.

00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:29.930
But temper you can see yourself, how your
temper is bad and how you want to get rid

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:31.599
of the temper.

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:34.440
Temper will kill all the collectivity.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.029
Temper will blur all the beauty of spirituality.

00:37:38.029 --> 00:37:47.240
A person who is very hot tempered and talks
of God, people will say, "Let's run away from

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.609
this man."

00:37:50.609 --> 00:37:53.740
So the temper you have to get rid of.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:38:00.920
It's very important to introspect on what
points you get angry.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.809
Some people think it's a matter of right for
them to get angry.

00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:10.560
All right, but not in Sahaj Yoga.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.550
You don't have to get angry.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.770
You don't have to shout at anyone.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:17.229
You don't have to beat anyone.

00:38:17.229 --> 00:38:18.960
If there is any problem, you can tell Me.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:27.210
But I have seen people fighting, quarrelling
sometime and I'm amazed how these people are

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.089
quarrelling among themselves.

00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:36.990
Gradually, I'm sure, as you'll grow in spirituality,
all these fights and quarrels and what you

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:42.000
call the different grouping ideas will drop
out.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.200
But Sahaja Yoga will not allow you to stay
in it.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.329
You'll be exposed immediately.

00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:52.230
People will know about you.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:39:01.579
So try to understand why you get angry, why
you have temper, what is the reason, what

00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:05.049
you don't like in other people may be within
you.

00:39:05.049 --> 00:39:08.329
Same thing may be existing within you.

00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:14.859
So, is a cleansing process in Sahaja Yoga,
which is very important and we need the help

00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:17.710
of Christ very much.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:22.050
Because there is rationality that covers your
Agnya.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.329
You can rationalize everything.

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:24.329
Everything.

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:31.369
Even if you kill somebody, you can rationalize
it.

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:41.380
So this Agnya is also our enemy if we cannot
keep it open.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.440
Absolutely.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.920
Because we can justify ourself.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.510
We can say, "What can I do?

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:51.259
It happened like that and this thing."

00:39:51.259 --> 00:39:56.809
Once you start, get after yourself; all these
things will go away.

00:39:56.809 --> 00:40:06.840
If you're getting angry very much, stand before
the mirror and try to get angry with yourself.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.560
Then attachments.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.930
Attachments are very subtle.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:21.150
Formerly, what I had known about the western
Sahaja Yogis, they didn't love their children

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.589
very well.

00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:27.369
Now, I find they're glued to their children.

00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:32.150
And they want to move the whole movement of
Sahaja Yoga according to the whims of their

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.150
children.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:40.130
Also, Indian Sahaja Yogis are like that.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:43.640
They're very attached to their children.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.329
They are, they have been always very attached
to their children.

00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:53.099
I've already explained to you that attachment
is the death of love.

00:40:53.099 --> 00:40:58.580
If you love somebody, then love everyone according
to the need of that person.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.880
You have to move.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.819
You cannot just stick into one point.

00:41:04.819 --> 00:41:07.819
That is not your responsibility.

00:41:07.819 --> 00:41:13.230
That is the responsibility of the Divine and
leave it to Divine and you will see.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:18.289
Your children will improve, your relationships
will improve, everything will improve because

00:41:18.289 --> 00:41:20.849
it's not your responsibility.

00:41:20.849 --> 00:41:33.910
Your limitations will affect all these relations
and I should actually say that this limited

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:40.950
relationship will, might, also suffocate the
relations.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:51.380
So I have a very wider vision and a wider
understanding how far you are.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.910
If you come in the nature, you can learn it
very well.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.910
See the water.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.480
It's coming to all the trees.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.130
Everyone is blessed.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.240
It doesn't stick to any, any one tree or anywhere.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:09.369
If it does that, the whole thing will be finished.

00:42:09.369 --> 00:42:16.170
If you have to think of collectivity, you
have to be very much detached and not driven

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:29.800
or persuaded into some sort of a small little
relationships.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.650
It's much easier for you to follow Sahaja
Yoga than anybody else in the world could

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:39.880
have followed because others were not realized
souls.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:47.500
You are all realized souls.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:56.980
There are other attachments - attachments
to money.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:10.960
Very surprising, like they treat Sahaja Yoga
sometimes like a shop or a market.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.069
So they'll say, "Mother, can You make it half
rate?

00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:18.600
Can You make it quarter rate?

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.069
Can You give us some concession?

00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:22.650
Some sale, you know."

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:32.490
There are at least thirty-five percent people
are coming free.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:41.970
And those who can pay want to have half, less
than half, but I don't know what to say to

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.040
them.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:51.970
I mean this is the only chance where you can
really give some money, which is, of course,

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.160
shared, I agree.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.700
It's not all that money is needed for one
person, but you can share, very easily with

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:03.150
others, because they don't have that much
money to come to this country, they don't

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.650
have that much money to live here.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:11.519
As we are talking about global life, we have
to understand that we have to share money

00:44:11.519 --> 00:44:14.210
with them.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:18.570
If you start understanding only this much,
I tell you, your attachment to money will

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:19.570
go away.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:25.519
That you have to share.

00:44:25.519 --> 00:44:27.650
You don't want to share anything.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:32.190
You may have crores, but you don't want to
share.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:37.990
In Sahaja Yoga, so many people have become
very rich, but they don't want to share.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:43.859
I'm not saying that we are here for money
or anything, but main point is, fundamental

00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:47.930
point, is the attitude should be of sharing
with others.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.450
Sahaja Yoga has given us so much.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.000
What have we done for it?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.320
Where are we sharing?

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:03.839
On the other side, we have people who are
very - very greedy who want more.

00:45:03.839 --> 00:45:10.869
There are some people who go on borrowing
money, some people who go on using people

00:45:10.869 --> 00:45:15.080
for their own purposes.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.280
All these petty, nonsensical things are not
for Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.300
You don't need.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.819
Whatever you need, you just ask, you'll get
it.

00:45:24.819 --> 00:45:31.940
So some people are trying to exploit some
people and some people are trying to save

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.460
themselves.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.450
There should be an open mind.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:47.380
As your Sahasrara is open here - you know,
this is the Heart Chakra here and this Heart

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:51.619
Chakra opens, then the Sahasrara opens.

00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:58.210
Open your hearts, open your hearts, then only
you can enjoy yourself.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:03.640
Now supposing I want to see something with
My eyes and My eyes are closed, can I see

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.829
something and enjoy that?

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:11.070
If you have to feel something from your heart,
your heart is closed, how can you?

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.030
How can you feel that?

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:17.190
So open your heart.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:20.309
Open your heart.

00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:31.230
In this way, you'll realize that things are
not so difficult.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:40.490
It's all for us very easy, but we have to
open our heart and respect each other.

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.512
Sahaja Yogis must respect each other.

00:46:42.512 --> 00:46:49.640
Somebody is black, somebody is white, somebody
is tall, somebody is short, somebody is like

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.640
that.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:56.710
God has made a variety otherwise we would
all have been like a regimentation.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:47:04.109
So we should enjoy the variety that makes
the beauty, beauty of creation.

00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:12.240
So all these outward things should not in
any way impress you.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:20.109
People should be clean, neat, tidy - that's
different.

00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:22.309
But everybody should be like you is wrong.

00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:33.609
In India especially, if you speak English
not very correctly, then he is condemned,

00:47:33.609 --> 00:47:37.220
as a scheduled caste.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.529
It's such slavish mentality, very slavish.

00:47:40.529 --> 00:47:46.329
Whether you know your language or not, your
mother tongue or not, Hindi or not, doesn't

00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:47.329
matter.

00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:48.329
You must know English.

00:47:48.329 --> 00:47:52.490
If somebody says "English", he is finished.

00:47:52.490 --> 00:48:01.500
Well, I have seen Japanese, Chinese, French,
anyone else speaks horrible, I mean funny

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:13.749
English, I should say, but the worst are the
English themselves.

00:48:13.749 --> 00:48:17.849
English have lost the sense of English completely,
but what's so much in that?

00:48:17.849 --> 00:48:25.509
It's nothing but a slavish mentality to one
regime, which was here for three hundred years

00:48:25.509 --> 00:48:33.509
and did nothing good to themselves, went empty
handed from here.

00:48:33.509 --> 00:48:42.890
Even the Christians in India believe that
Christ was born in England, do you believe

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:43.890
that?

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:46.289
Most of them.

00:48:46.289 --> 00:48:55.690
So the essence of a life is to be proud of
whatever country we are born of, we must love

00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:01.150
our own country, but we should not identify
with it.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:04.880
All the wrongs of that country we should criticize
and we should see.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:10.640
We should not accept them and should not become
a part and parcel of those absurd people who

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.770
have their limitations.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:14.359
Do you transcend your countries?

00:49:14.359 --> 00:49:20.109
You transcend all these limitations.

00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:22.029
You have become great now.

00:49:22.029 --> 00:49:29.400
How can you remain in a small little pond?

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.400
You need an ocean.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:36.599
You'll get suffocated.

00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:42.730
Another thing is, you should not use things
made by machine so much.

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:47.999
Try to avoid, as far as possible.

00:49:47.999 --> 00:49:52.350
These machines have created so many problems
for us.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:59.609
We should wear something that is made by hand
or by people who are using small, little,

00:49:59.609 --> 00:50:07.740
sort of, we can call, ordinary machines, which
does not require so much of smoke to come

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.779
out.

00:50:08.779 --> 00:50:13.960
We should be very conscious of ecological
problems as Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:20.289
But one thing I know, where there are Sahaja
Yogis the ecological problems also gets solved

00:50:20.289 --> 00:50:22.930
because of vibrations.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:26.900
But vibrations will only fight when you are
willing to fight ecology.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:35.279
Everywhere you go, you find so much of pollution,
so much of pollution.

00:50:35.279 --> 00:50:38.970
How to fight this pollution?

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:44.190
Is to be paying attention to the ecology.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:50.830
Are we producing all those things, which is
spoiling the atmosphere?

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:54.950
We are responsible, we have to do it.

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.809
Who is going to do it?

00:50:57.809 --> 00:51:05.839
So one side, as I told you, we have to look
after the people who are poorer than us, who

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:06.839
are unfortunate.

00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:13.670
We have to look after the atmosphere which
is filled with all nonsensical things and

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:25.380
take to a lifestyle, which lifestyle will
be simpler, by which we don't use so many,

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:33.579
so many vehicles and so many things which
are creating problems.

00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:39.280
Like in Dehra Dhun they told me they have
so many of these three-wheelers that the buses

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.280
have stopped.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.280
Why?

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:46.720
Because in the three-wheeler you pay some
money less, so they go by the three-wheeler

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.730
and it creates all the black soot all over.

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:56.710
A Sahaja Yogi should never sit in a three-wheeler
to save some money.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:04.259
It's better to walk or use a vehicle which
doesn't give much of these things.

00:52:04.259 --> 00:52:13.569
They are so many ways by which we can really
be very supportive of this ecological problem

00:52:13.569 --> 00:52:20.820
because it is a part of our, part of our responsibility.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:29.690
Till the age of forty-seven, I was wearing
only pure khadi, pure khadi, not even silk,

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:31.999
till the age of forty-seven.

00:52:31.999 --> 00:52:42.779
Then when this Sahasrara was broken, then
I started wearing other clothes.

00:52:42.779 --> 00:52:51.140
Our life should be such that we should feel
sensitive to every growth around us.

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:57.329
It is only our attention, how you put your
attention to things.

00:52:57.329 --> 00:53:04.950
Like now, there are so many new things are
coming up in India, everywhere.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:14.200
One day, I told somebody that why didn't you
get some quails from Germany?

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.890
He said, "I don't know.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:16.890
There is quail in Germany?"

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:17.890
I said, "There is a big industry of quails.

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:18.890
What do you say?"

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:19.890
"How do you know, Mother?"

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.369
I said, "I know."

00:53:21.369 --> 00:53:30.280
Once I go to a country, I know everything
about that, all the details about it.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:36.759
I was surprised that such a big industry they
had, they never knew they had quails.

00:53:36.759 --> 00:53:42.000
In the same way, in our own country, we don't
know what we have, what artistic things we

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.999
have, what is, what is the one that is, that
will help the poor.

00:53:48.999 --> 00:53:52.970
We never know about it.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:54:00.859
Why Christ was born in those conditions because
He wanted to give blessings to those poor

00:54:00.859 --> 00:54:07.430
people, to help them with spirituality.

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:14.259
But we are not bothered, we are not bothered
to see where the poverty is and how we can

00:54:14.259 --> 00:54:15.259
help.

00:54:15.259 --> 00:54:21.660
You can, by all means, you can help them in
every corner, in every way.

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:30.289
It's very simple to understand about your
own country, where the problem is, why people

00:54:30.289 --> 00:54:35.079
are poor and we cannot help them.

00:54:35.079 --> 00:54:37.799
We have to take to this.

00:54:37.799 --> 00:54:42.829
Unless and until your light shines in the
society, we are doing nothing.

00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:49.150
We are just enjoying our own Sahaja Yoga,
Ganapatipule and all that.

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.569
But what about others?

00:54:52.569 --> 00:54:59.980
So sensitivity to art, sensitivity to music,
sensitivity to all creative things that are

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:06.390
there and what can we do with these creative
things for others.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:12.660
The attention should be more towards these
things than about useless things.

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:14.740
Politics you shouldn't worry so much.

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.890
It will be all exposed and finished and it
will be alright.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:22.440
Let them fight, let them do what they like.

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.630
They're stupid people.

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:32.750
Your attention should be how you can be creative,
how you can help people, how what you can

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.750
do.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:42.289
In everything there's one thing - is Love,
what you call is compassion, Anukampa, just

00:55:42.289 --> 00:55:47.819
out of love and affection and that should
be an real innate expression of every Sahaja

00:55:47.819 --> 00:55:51.890
Yogi in every field of life.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:55.644
I don't like this, I don't like that, this
kind of a person is never a Sahaja Yogi.

00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:58.760
The one who says, "I like."

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:06.349
My throat was not all right, but somebody
brought some fruit.

00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:11.150
Just to please, I ate it.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:17.539
Doesn't matter what, little bit, I did eat.

00:56:17.539 --> 00:56:21.700
Just to please you, I wore such a heavy saree.

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.480
None of you can wear it, I can tell you.

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.020
Just to please you.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:30.299
So what are we doing to please others?

00:56:30.299 --> 00:56:31.299
You should be a pleasing personality.

00:56:31.299 --> 00:56:37.329
Instead of thinking about how you should be
pleased, I don't like this, I don't do like

00:56:37.329 --> 00:56:44.099
that, instead of, what have I done to please
others?

00:56:44.099 --> 00:56:53.079
To please the Divine, our character, our behavior
should be absolutely clean.

00:56:53.079 --> 00:56:57.540
I know Sahaja Yogis have done wonders and
they are doing very well, but they can do

00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.130
much, much, much more than what they are doing.

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:07.589
So on this day of Christ's birthday, I have
to tell you that it is not possible to follow

00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:09.549
His life, I agree.

00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:10.549
Very difficult.

00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:19.029
But at least, one has to learn from Him that
He is before us and let us try to go forward

00:57:19.029 --> 01:03:32.219
towards Him, in His simplicity, in His honesty
and the sacrifices 

01:03:32.219 --> 01:04:13.029
He could make.

01:04:13.029 --> 01:57:06.340
May God bless you.
