00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:16.532
You can't imagine how a Mother who has so many beautiful children

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:21.497
sees them in such joyous mood

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:28.315
with their families, their children, nicely settled down.

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:35.694
It's very satisfying to see you all so much

00:00:35.694 --> 00:00:42.913
in joy and complete oneness with the Divine.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:48.363
One has to realize only one thing:

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.728
that though you are many,

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:57.267
still compared to the population of this world, we are very few

00:00:57.517 --> 00:01:03.697
who really know the true knowledge, the real knowledge.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:07.817
You are the people who are knowledgeable, no doubt,

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:16.506
but also knowledge which is not being adorned with truth

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:20.948
or which is not the true knowledge has no meaning.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:26.392
All that vanishes into thin air because it is artificial.

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:31.951
By your Kundalini awakening you all have achieved

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:35.849
that state where we can say you know.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.487
You know what is the real knowledge is,

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:45.229
but think of the people who do not know what knowledge is.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.713
We take, for example we say that

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:55.183
our knowledge is nothing but love,

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:58.188
but one should understand the discrimination.

00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:02.711
The knowledge that is love within you

00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:07.239
is just emitting out from your being.

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:11.511
You don't have to assert, you don't have to think,

00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:16.738
you don't have to read some sort of a poetry or go into some romantic mood

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:24.055
just pure love which emits, and this is the knowledge also.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.626
How you have to relate it is this way:

00:02:31.357 --> 00:02:37.975
the knowledge that you have about yourself is evident,

00:02:38.204 --> 00:02:41.403
is absolutely expressed on your fingertips,

00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:43.945
and about others also.

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:47.754
You know about others and about yourself.

00:02:47.754 --> 00:02:56.902
This is the greatest subtle knowledge you have.

00:02:56.902 --> 00:02:58.831
No one knows like that.

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:04.935
Apart from you people, no one knows about themselves or about others.

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:08.033
So this knowledge that has come to you,

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:13.530
which is extremely subtle,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.426
extremely secretive, absolutely secret.

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.902
If you know about somebody, you know.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.913
Others do not know that you know about them,

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:31.843
and so this knowledge that you have got is nothing but love.

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:37.366
It's very difficult to make knowledge and love put together,

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:41.092
because our idea of knowledge is very different,

00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:43.651
what we read from the books.

00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:46.709
How can you love from the books?

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.628
What love means, our attachments

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:53.354
to us, in ignorance we get attached

00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:58.473
to people, to children, to family, to things.

00:04:00.753 --> 00:04:06.960
By getting attachment it is proved that we do not have the knowledge.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.397
If you have the knowledge then all attachments

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:14.636
should just drop out and you should become a global personality,

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:16.539
a drop in the ocean.
