00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:15.401
This spirit in our heart is the one 
which is the witness of our being.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:19.073
It is the witness that sees what’s happening.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:25.867
In Gita is it called as KshetrAgnya, 
the one who knows the field,

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:28.093
which knows the (battle) field.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.500
This knower of the field resides 
in our heart and watches us.

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:41.716
He knows each and everything 
about us and He guides us.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:50.893
But we are not in contact with Him. 
We do not know Him.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.425
That means He is not acting 
through our central nervous system.

00:00:56.498 --> 00:00:59.810
For example, we know our eyes, 
we know our nose,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.089
we know our ears because 
we can feel them.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.902
We can see the use of all these organs.

00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:14.073
But we cannot feel that 
which is in our heart, you see.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:20.233
That is our absolute. 
That is the one we have to know.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:23.285
That is the source of joy.

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:29.661
We may say that we are very happy to have this, 
we are unhappy to do this.

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:35.668
But this joy that we have has no double thing. 
It’s just sheer joy.

00:01:35.668 --> 00:01:39.180
It is not happiness and unhappiness.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.808
This Spirit exists in our heart.

00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:48.442
When you all are seeking, 
actually you are seeking that Spirit.

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:53.622
Through that Spirit you know the whole,

00:01:53.622 --> 00:02:00.118
the primordial being, the macrocosm 
of which you are just a part.

00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:06.675
Like the whole body has cells, 
you are cells in that body.

00:02:09.075 --> 00:02:13.474
You have to know because 
you are created for that.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:16.868
As we have created this instrument, 
it has to be plugged,

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.810
otherwise it has no meaning.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.465
In the same way, unless and until 
you are plugged to that whole,

00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:25.110
you have no meaning at all.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.361
Whatever you are doing with this instrument, 
without plugging is all a waste.
