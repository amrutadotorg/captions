1
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:10,146
If you take bath with cold water you can never catch cold

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,383
because the temperature is the same.

3
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:16,030
For a while you will feel it’s cold water, but it’s very good

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,825
– those people who take bath with cold water.

5
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:22,953
Did you get hot water to have baths?

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,382
Where?

7
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:31,734
Yogi: In Rahuri. Even in Brahmapuri.

8
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,833
Shri Mataji: You had hot water? That’s very wrong.

9
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:38,083
That’s the reason [you got sick]. That explains it.

10
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:40,482
If you have to take bath with hot water

11
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:44,086
then you must get into your bed.

12
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:48,216
If you have to take it in the open,

13
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:52,477
sure shot you will get temperature. Absolutely sure shot.

14
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:57,458
This is a very simple thing which I don’t know how you don’t know.

15
00:00:57,578 --> 00:01:02,594
You should never take your bath in the open

16
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,289
with the hot water.

17
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:10,857
That’s sure shot. I mean, in the school supposing

18
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:14,028
some boy doesn’t want to go, then what he does,

19
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:17,333
he keeps the window open and takes his bath with hot water

20
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:21,422
– finished! – he gets a temperature immediately the next day.

21
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,535
So in Brahmapuri if they have given you hot water,

22
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:29,725
you should not have taken bath. That was wrong.

23
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:33,114
Even if you had got it. I mean, river Ganges,

24
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:36,703
I don’t know how many have been to River Ganges?

25
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:42,138
You have been. Now the water is freezing cold I tell you,

26
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:44,724
it’s absolutely freezing cold.

27
00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:48,318
When you put your foot you will just push it back, it’s so cold.

28
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,969
But people get into it. Slowly, slowly, they just move; slip into it.

29
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:58,153
And when you come out your cheeks are red like apples!

30
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:00,427
It’s so very cold. Isn’t it?

31
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:04,536
But nothing happens. Nobody catches cold or anything.

32
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:07,333
So in the running water is the cleanest and

33
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:10,732
where you could get in, get into cold water.

34
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:13,934
Otherwise, even if you have to take a hot water bath,

35
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:16,075
take it in the night or maybe

36
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:20,052
at the time when you can go off into your bed.

37
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:22,892
In England also people take their baths in the night

38
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,568
mostly and get into bed.

39
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:27,638
Supposing you take hot bath in England and go out

40
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:32,352
immediately you will get cancer of the lungs.

41
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:39,318
Hot and cold is a very important thing one has to know.

42
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:43,146
Like also you can see on the hands you feel hot and cold.

43
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:46,789
So now supposing you have taken the coffee,

44
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:51,219
after that you cannot take anything cold.

45
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:55,318
Is a simple thing one should understand.

46
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:58,060
First you can take anything cold.

47
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,982
Like I have seen people take coffee and then ice cream!

48
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:05,028
I mean, [it’s] sure you get troubles! Absolutely sure.

49
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:07,896
But if you are taking ice cream, first take ice cream,

50
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:11,224
then take a biscuit and then take some water,

51
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:16,180
then take some biscuit and then you can take something hot.

52
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,797
Now supposing you have taken something hot

53
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:22,844
and you have to take water also. Then take three biscuits.

54
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:29,107
Another very great precaution you have to take

55
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,318
which I have seen nobody takes

56
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:35,028
– now it sometimes becomes very hot outside.

57
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,344
You are sitting down into programmes or something, becomes very hot.

58
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,799
You are sitting in the sun sometimes

59
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,122
and your head gets very heated up.

60
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,771
Immediately [if] you go and get cold water,

61
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:49,399
definitely you will get sick, no doubt about it.

62
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,813
That’s the best way to get sick!

63
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:55,318
So if you are sitting in the sun,

64
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,278
immediately you should never, never, never take any water

65
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:01,575
till you have eaten something sweet.

66
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:04,318
Take some sugar, or take some jaggery,

67
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:07,172
or some biscuit or something.

68
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,031
Even if you are very thirsty you should not do it.

69
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,063
Little precautions have to be taken.

70
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:17,223
Nothing should happen to Sahaja Yogis.

71
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:21,570
Because if you get sick, I get sick. That’s the problem is.

72
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:24,685
And that’s why I was so sick yesterday.

73
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,068
I knew that you must be all very sick

74
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:29,388
that’s why it has happened to me.
