WEBVTT

00:00.632 --> 00:06.828
On seeing the depth of your love, My heart feels overwhelmed.

00:06.853 --> 00:17.561
In this Kaliyuga, it is very difficult to recognize Mother

00:17.586 --> 00:20.430
because we don't recognize our Mother

00:20.455 --> 00:25.193
so, it becomes all the more difficult to recognize Me.

00:25.218 --> 00:34.806
But the depth of this land of BENGAL is working in you.

00:34.830 --> 00:38.190
So, I observe that

00:38.214 --> 00:43.837
any Sahajyogi, who comes from this place, goes deep, gets deeper.

00:43.862 --> 00:45.758
He goes very deep.

00:45.782 --> 00:53.341
And it is so surprising, that the places where I did a lot of work

00:53.366 --> 00:58.429
there the people are many, but they are not so deep.

00:58.453 --> 01:03.742
And the collectivity among them is not as beautiful as it is here.

01:03.766 --> 01:09.882
The speciality, of Bang bhumi, I say, is

01:09.907 --> 01:13.760
that the collectivity and love for each other

01:13.785 --> 01:19.171
if we look at it, is absolutely selfless and unselfish.

01:19.196 --> 01:24.596
On seeing all this, you dont know how happy I am!

01:24.620 --> 01:31.171
And I wish that your work may progress much more

01:31.196 --> 01:34.160
and spread among the masses.

01:34.184 --> 01:40.536
Because you know that, this land is very much dear to Mother.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.975
You had told that today, Saraswati Puja will be performed.

01:43.999 --> 01:46.325
It is absolutely necessary

01:46.349 --> 01:51.124
that in Bang Desh, Saraswati should be worshiped.

01:51.148 --> 01:53.719
Because of Devi’s blessings only

01:53.744 --> 02:00.269
and because of Her sacrifice, this land is SASHYA - SHYAMALAM

02:00.294 --> 02:02.540
such fertile and green.

02:02.565 --> 02:12.705
But the reason why poverty and the suffering is here

02:12.729 --> 02:15.660
that whatever the worship of Saraswati has been done

02:15.685 --> 02:21.878
was very limited (NOT CLEAR).

02:21.903 --> 02:26.567
People did not pray Mahasarawati, only Saraswati has been worshipped

02:26.592 --> 02:30.231
in which we can encourage artistic talents

02:30.358 --> 02:34.982
or, we can become scholars.

02:35.007 --> 02:37.327
From this place the scholars are one better than the other

02:37.351 --> 02:38.666
Many scientists have evolved  from here.

02:38.690 --> 02:49.611
People have progressed a lot in the field of education

02:49.635 --> 02:51.403
compared to people from other places.

02:51.428 --> 02:55.785
People from here are very intelligent and are very matured.

02:55.810 --> 02:59.101
Inspite of all this, why there is still poverty here?

02:59.126 --> 03:05.031
We should come up with a formula

03:05.056 --> 03:07.828
as to why there is so much of poverty is here?

03:07.852 --> 03:14.393
Why do we have in a way, jealosy within us?

03:14.418 --> 03:18.442
That if someone gets some money, we are are jealous of him.

03:18.466 --> 03:23.020
By being jealous of him or hatred, poverty will not go away.

03:23.045 --> 03:25.746
For that we need to understand

03:25.771 --> 03:32.144
what is it we are lacking, that we need to overcome.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.311
Saraswati you know that

03:33.335 --> 03:39.273
as per Sahaja Yoga, the work of Maha Saraswati is on the right side.

03:39.298 --> 03:44.094
When She works on the Swadishthan chakra

03:44.119 --> 03:49.043
and when the Swadishthan chakra moves towards the left,

03:49.068 --> 03:53.064
then all the artistic talents are developed.

03:53.088 --> 03:55.981
The music here is fantastic.

03:56.005 --> 04:03.535
And there is no field of art that is not there in Bengal.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.586
In everything, even in movies, in dramas

04:08.611 --> 04:14.820
every art field like, dance, music, sculpture

04:14.845 --> 04:18.193
in everything, Bang Desh is very famous.

04:18.217 --> 04:20.765
Nowhere else, you will find artists better than them.

04:20.790 --> 04:25.169
You tell them any small thing, they will immediately do it.

04:25.194 --> 04:29.560
The gold jewelly designers here, are also very famous.

04:29.584 --> 04:34.893
It is because they have reached that state of art, of fine art.

04:34.918 --> 04:41.017
The fne form of art, which is famous and accepted all over the world.

04:41.042 --> 04:46.632
It is in a way created such

04:46.657 --> 04:52.999
that you can see lot of like Divine Light in it.

04:53.031 --> 04:58.153
You cannot see the Divine Light in it, but it is full of vibrations.

04:58.178 --> 05:01.284
Anything that is created very beautifully

05:01.309 --> 05:10.111
and recognised all over the world, is aesthetically rich.

05:10.136 --> 05:13.729
If you put your hands towards it

05:13.753 --> 05:17.346
you will feel vibrations flowing from it.

05:17.370 --> 05:18.748
There will be vibrations flowing from it.

05:18.773 --> 05:27.432
If a Realized person makes a sculpture or any art form

05:27.456 --> 05:32.202
from that you can  feel the vibrations flowing.

05:32.226 --> 05:38.786
The reason is that people who live here are very devotional.

05:38.811 --> 05:44.540
The people are deep from within and take any art form of this place.

05:44.565 --> 05:49.354
There is nowhere in the world that it is not liked

05:49.379 --> 05:53.222
or liked by people, appreaciated .

05:53.247 --> 05:55.410
There is no such art form, from Bengal

05:55.434 --> 06:02.205
whether it is, painting, even cinema, dance, that is not appreaciated.

06:02.230 --> 06:04.415
They say that people of Bengal are perfectionist

06:04.439 --> 06:06.581
who have achieved totality.

06:06.605 --> 06:10.422
When we have progressed on one side (of Swadishthan)

06:10.446 --> 06:15.387
we have not used the other side of Swadishthan.

06:15.411 --> 06:19.672
Even when we use the other side of Swadishtan

06:19.697 --> 06:29.546
that too we think, we use it only for reading, writing and such things.

06:29.570 --> 06:34.333
We have not paid attention to a state higher than this.

06:34.358 --> 06:38.485
That is why now a days, there is imbalance.

06:38.510 --> 06:40.693
If you look at it, it is a very accomplished place.

06:40.717 --> 06:42.900
So much of art, literature, everything is there

06:42.925 --> 06:46.180
and whatever the problems here are

06:46.205 --> 06:50.689
and people say that the union of Saraswati and Lakshmi takes place.

06:50.714 --> 06:55.840
It is right that there may be no union between Saraswati and Lakshmi

06:55.865 --> 06:59.335
but the union can be achieved in Mahasaraswati.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.667
Being in unision with Mahasaraswati means that

07:02.691 --> 07:08.124
whatever you are doing there

07:08.149 --> 07:11.052
you go to the deeper aspect and start thinking.

07:11.076 --> 07:17.197
After all, what is the reason that there is no union with Lakshmi?

07:17.230 --> 07:20.901
Why there is no union with Mahalaxmi?

07:20.926 --> 07:28.193
In Sahaja Yoga, both meet at the Agnya chakra and is (NOT CLEAR)

07:28.218 --> 07:36.925
Because, if you look at the action part, it is tremendous

07:36.949 --> 07:43.275
but you do not get the result that you desire.

07:43.300 --> 07:49.523
If you come into Agyna chakra, you start thinking.

07:49.548 --> 07:54.902
Why, till now, we have not got that state?

07:54.966 --> 07:58.135
which so many artists have got

07:58.160 --> 08:03.432
that totality which other enlightened people have been granted?

08:03.456 --> 08:07.047
and why are we living in poverty?”

08:07.071 --> 08:09.503
What we need to understand is that

08:09.527 --> 08:17.179
till we do not reach that state where we see both aspects

08:17.203 --> 08:20.378
till then, we cannot progress.

08:20.402 --> 08:26.742
To unite art with Lakshmi we need balanced vision.

08:26.766 --> 08:31.701
So,One of our greatest weaknesses within us is

08:31.726 --> 08:37.239
it is said about Bengalis, is stubbornness. They are very stubborn.

08:37.264 --> 08:40.012
Suppose they take to some art form

08:40.037 --> 08:44.179
like if they have made an elephant, they will go on making elephants.

08:44.203 --> 08:47.121
If they make a horse, they go on making horses.

08:47.146 --> 08:49.004
If they like a particular type of music

08:49.029 --> 08:51.312
they will go on singing in the same way.

08:51.337 --> 08:55.195
If you tell them to change it

08:55.219 --> 08:57.428
they will immediately get angry.

08:57.453 --> 09:00.341
They feel that their art is not respected at all.

09:00.365 --> 09:06.544
At Agnya Chakra, if you contemplate, the stubbornness catches Agnya.

09:06.568 --> 09:15.864
“We are Bengalis. We have the greatest artists, intellectuals”.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.195
By taking the names of great artists

09:17.220 --> 09:19.109
they think that they are also great.

09:19.133 --> 09:23.387
It is not true, you need to understand.

09:23.411 --> 09:27.805
If you look at them, you will know that they are not stubborn at all

09:27.829 --> 09:32.051
But you are stubborn when you say that,'We are great people

09:32.103 --> 09:34.665
because we have such great people from Bang Desh.

09:34.690 --> 09:37.188
Thinking like that you cannot reach that level

09:37.213 --> 09:44.501
but yes, you can live in the shadow of their glory.

09:44.525 --> 09:48.726
But if you want to rise above that, we should give up stubbornnes.

09:48.751 --> 09:51.297
'we are like this only’, 'we will continue to be like this’

09:51.321 --> 09:53.490
'we will not do anything more than this’

09:53.514 --> 09:57.189
'and we will not compromise with our style’.

09:57.213 --> 09:59.196
That is not possible.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.467
By compromising, I am not telling that you destroy the art.

10:02.491 --> 10:05.673
Don’t have to destroy the art in any manner.

10:05.697 --> 10:11.255
But you must think of art, in a balanced manner.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.600
I am telling you something practical.

10:14.624 --> 10:18.354
One is the laziness within us

10:18.378 --> 10:20.862
that laziness too leads to stubbornness.

10:20.887 --> 10:25.443
When a person starts becoming lazy, he also becomes very stubborn.

10:25.467 --> 10:30.407
He does not think that I am stubborn because of laziness.

10:30.432 --> 10:34.205
Because, for learning something new, I have to make an effort.

10:34.229 --> 10:38.980
But something that I already know, I can do effortlessly.

10:39.004 --> 10:43.622
But Mataji was saying, Just make some changes, it will be alright.

10:43.647 --> 10:45.606
That I cannot do.

10:45.631 --> 10:50.165
In this, one thing is stubborness and behind that is laziness.

10:50.189 --> 10:55.874
We are slow at learning anything new, because of  being slow learners.

10:55.898 --> 10:58.331
And because of this slow speed

10:58.355 --> 11:01.027
we cannot learn new things

11:01.052 --> 11:05.717
which can definitely give us the blessings of Lakshmi.

11:05.742 --> 11:09.680
For example, I went to an organization, where I said

11:09.705 --> 11:13.275
Tell the Bengalis that the purses you make

11:13.300 --> 11:15.390
don’t make it so elaborate.

11:15.415 --> 11:19.439
Make it in a single line, then people will like it very much.

11:19.463 --> 11:23.335
This is not possible, we cannot do this.

11:23.359 --> 11:25.123
we will continue to make the same way

11:25.147 --> 11:27.230
we cannot make it the way you are saying.

11:27.255 --> 11:29.776
we cannot make it the way you are saying.

11:29.801 --> 11:32.435
You cannot give any suggestion.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.833
They will continue to make in the same elaborate manner.

11:34.858 --> 11:37.522
You may keep in stock twenty five articles ready

11:37.546 --> 11:38.822
and it will not be sold.

11:38.846 --> 11:41.006
They will say, We have the stock.

11:41.031 --> 11:43.000
It is alright if it is not sold, we have the stock.

11:43.025 --> 11:45.867
They continue to be proud of it.

11:45.892 --> 11:49.456
There must be an understanding.

11:49.480 --> 11:56.109
Now in Sahaja Yoga, your brains open up, it opens up completely.

11:56.134 --> 11:59.831
His Agnya opens out. First of all the stubborness reduces.

11:59.856 --> 12:02.222
I will insist that this is the only way to do it

12:02.247 --> 12:04.181
and there is no other right way.

12:04.206 --> 12:06.574
Whatever i do is only right.

12:06.599 --> 12:09.164
You can benefit, once you give up the stubborness.

12:09.188 --> 12:15.246
Like I have seen in many people, they have different type of qualities.

12:15.270 --> 12:19.201
But in that stubbornness, it is all lost in stubborness.

12:19.225 --> 12:23.157
It can have a very great effect on a person's entire life.

12:23.181 --> 12:26.825
We are like this only and will remain so.

12:26.850 --> 12:36.272
No, we should change, and this change can be achieved very easily in Sahaja.

12:36.296 --> 12:40.917
When you get it in Sahaj way then you will be surprised that

12:40.942 --> 12:44.161
it is in Sahaj way only, that the union with Laxmi can be achieved.

12:44.185 --> 12:47.217
I have seen this expecially in the artists that

12:47.242 --> 12:51.621
they are so stubborn that if you tell them

12:51.646 --> 12:53.466
Please make this small change.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.002
They’ll say, No, we will not change it.

12:55.026 --> 12:57.802
Only this suits us and we will stick to it.

12:57.827 --> 13:00.374
Even if the people who are listening get up and go away

13:00.398 --> 13:01.334
it doesn't matter.

13:01.358 --> 13:02.998
we will still continue to sing in the same way.

13:03.023 --> 13:05.994
we will say the same way' or 'continue to make the same way.

13:06.018 --> 13:09.815
To put the Agnya chakra right

13:09.840 --> 13:13.142
we must first put right, this strange ego which says that

13:13.166 --> 13:14.147
whatever we have been doing

13:14.172 --> 13:16.476
and whatever we have done, is the only right way

13:16.500 --> 13:18.803
and whatever we do is right.

13:18.828 --> 13:25.891
This methodology we have made, we have to change this method.

13:25.915 --> 13:27.971
Now there are so many things in this.

13:27.995 --> 13:32.164
For example, we belong to some dharma.

13:32.189 --> 13:40.191
For example, we are Brahmo Samaji, or Hindus, or Muslims, Christians etc.

13:40.216 --> 13:42.213
You are nothing but a human being.

13:42.237 --> 13:43.947
You were born as a human being.

13:43.972 --> 13:49.021
You have branded yourself that I am this, I am that.

13:49.045 --> 13:52.157
You are neither Bengali nor Marathi.

13:52.181 --> 13:55.839
You are just human beings.

13:55.863 --> 13:59.379
By branding yourself you create more problems.

13:59.404 --> 14:04.397
like, I am Bengali, I am Marathi, I am this, I am that

14:04.422 --> 14:06.681
I am Christian, I am Muslim, I am Jain.

14:06.705 --> 14:08.281
All these are brands

14:08.306 --> 14:10.875
and these brands become so important

14:10.900 --> 14:13.634
that you cannot see anything beyond that.

14:13.658 --> 14:18.555
That became the most important thing and nothing beyond that.

14:18.579 --> 14:20.765
This is another reason of the catch of Agnya.

14:20.790 --> 14:23.388
It is very difficult to get rid of this catch.

14:23.413 --> 14:27.876
Till you get rid of this catch, your blindness will not go.

14:27.900 --> 14:33.456
Because you will look at everything in a very narrow manner.

14:33.544 --> 14:37.907
It is not only here.  In the West also it is so.

14:37.932 --> 14:39.445
In the West it is even more

14:39.470 --> 14:42.931
because, once something goes into their brains

14:42.956 --> 14:46.275
that 'it is good’, then they will follow it blindly.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.761
There are such people that they are just critics.

14:49.785 --> 14:53.558
They will say, This art form is good, then it gets sold.

14:53.583 --> 14:55.891
Another critic says, This is not good, it won’t get sold.

14:55.916 --> 14:59.485
One critic is accepted.

14:59.509 --> 15:00.996
Then the other critics will come and say

15:01.020 --> 15:03.513
This is useless, the other one is good. Accept that one.

15:03.537 --> 15:09.231
Nothing comes to them from their own brains, from within.

15:09.255 --> 15:11.263
Nothing is fixed.

15:11.287 --> 15:14.668
Whatever others have filled in your head is correct.

15:14.692 --> 15:17.557
This is the reason that they have filled our minds

15:17.581 --> 15:21.099
that we belong to this brand, that brand.

15:21.124 --> 15:21.730
Right from our childhood

15:21.755 --> 15:24.057
we are put into a certain brand, one after the other.

15:24.081 --> 15:25.809
In the end you belong to the same street.

15:25.834 --> 15:30.584
Don’t even belong to the same parents, same family.

15:30.608 --> 15:33.656
Like this the humans go on branding themselves.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.176
The fault in branding is that

15:37.201 --> 15:43.579
they think that I am a great personality and very unique individual.

15:43.604 --> 15:44.947
He wants to become an Individual.

15:44.972 --> 15:49.292
Even though, i have been branded but i have to become an individual.

15:49.316 --> 15:55.684
And this itself, which is the essence of truth

15:55.708 --> 15:58.686
that we are all one.

15:58.711 --> 16:03.685
we are whole, (NOT CLEAR), totality

16:03.709 --> 16:07.233
Everything is one, it goes in the opposition of this truth.

16:07.258 --> 16:12.372
When you go in opposition – ‚'I am this type of person or that type of person’ .

16:12.396 --> 16:15.293
From this you are getting separated from each other.

16:15.317 --> 16:18.761
For example, you say, 'I am Hindu, you are a Muslim', you separate into two.

16:18.785 --> 16:20.809
Then again in Muslims, you are bifurcated in four categories.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.194
Those four categories of Muslims will have another ten divisions.

16:23.218 --> 16:25.959
Like this you go on separating yourself.

16:25.983 --> 16:30.007
You start losing the connection with the whole

16:30.031 --> 16:34.733
which is the goal of your life to achieve.

16:34.757 --> 16:42.245
So the first thing is that, all the variety has been made by God.

16:42.270 --> 16:46.844
But one leaf doesn’t resemble the other, but if they are all on one tree

16:46.868 --> 16:54.863
they are all part and parcel of the Virata.

16:54.888 --> 16:59.414
And if we are all parts of one person

16:59.439 --> 17:05.251
in that wholeness, the individuality is adjoined.

17:05.276 --> 17:08.669
So, by separating ourselves, we destroy ourselves.

17:08.693 --> 17:12.014
And in this way, the saraswati tatwa

17:12.039 --> 17:14.873
which should manifest into Maha Saraswati is not there.

17:14.897 --> 17:26.388
At the Maha Saraswati level, man's ideas, his vision changes.

17:26.413 --> 17:30.161
It changes even in his daily life.

17:30.185 --> 17:37.328
The person starts to see that they all have become whole.

17:37.352 --> 17:40.090
Now, we are all one.

17:40.114 --> 17:44.269
So then, whatever he creates, or does

17:44.293 --> 17:47.499
he creates some such beautiful thing

17:47.523 --> 17:50.478
or, he does such a beautiful work

17:50.503 --> 17:54.023
that man recognizes by heart only.

17:54.047 --> 17:58.539
By heart only he says that it is beautiful.

17:58.563 --> 18:01.633
But even then, it should be understood

18:01.658 --> 18:08.190
that whatever are our jobs of Saraswati

18:08.215 --> 18:12.114
that we think that we are worshipping Saraswati.

18:12.138 --> 18:14.684
Why don't they understand?

18:14.708 --> 18:19.655
If they do Saraswati's work, if they are surrendered to God

18:19.679 --> 18:21.271
they become immortal.

18:21.295 --> 18:26.843
Now you see, the peotry that has become immortal in the world

18:26.867 --> 18:29.917
it is God's work.

18:29.941 --> 18:32.348
The poems and songs

18:32.373 --> 18:34.668
Now, you see new songs have come

18:34.692 --> 18:38.009
new songs come and die down soon.

18:38.033 --> 18:42.533
We listen to only those songs, repeat only those things

18:42.557 --> 18:45.995
which were written by Kabir, written by Gyaneshwar.

18:46.020 --> 18:49.359
Even in foreign countries, I see that

18:49.384 --> 18:52.166
what was written by William Blake is recognized.

18:52.191 --> 18:55.052
what was written by Shakesphere is recognized.

18:55.077 --> 18:59.403
They were all self realized people.

18:59.427 --> 19:01.661
Mozart was self realized.

19:01.685 --> 19:07.600
Maha Saraswati Shakti they had because of self realization.

19:07.876 --> 19:13.054
whatever they wrote because of that power, was of a unique kind.

19:13.078 --> 19:19.027
There was nothing in them that you could say

19:19.052 --> 19:22.569
that they looked uncultured.

19:22.593 --> 19:28.992
They were so cultured that they could unite the world.

19:29.016 --> 19:30.802
So, Once you become a Sahaja yogi

19:30.827 --> 19:34.059
then you should move on to the Maha Saraswati tattwa.

19:34.084 --> 19:36.446
You should not follow Saraswati Tattwa

19:36.471 --> 19:41.384
because it limits you, your imagination is like that.

19:41.408 --> 19:43.966
If Saraswati Tattwa is the seed

19:43.991 --> 19:46.781
then its tree is Maha Saraswati.

19:46.805 --> 19:50.615
Till you do not make this seed into Maha Saraswati

19:50.639 --> 19:55.325
till then you cannot get connected to Maha Laxmi.

19:55.349 --> 20:06.748
The blessing of Mahalaxmi is that you get your self realization.

20:06.772 --> 20:12.550
The third thing that you have achieved is

20:12.574 --> 20:15.224
which we can say is MahaKali Tattwa.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.838
All the three Powers (Mahalakshmi, Maha Saraswati and Maha Kali)

20:16.863 --> 20:18.828
meet at your Agnya.

20:18.852 --> 20:23.201
And you should cross over this Agnya.

20:23.225 --> 20:28.066
In every subtle way there is an ego.

20:28.090 --> 20:31.970
Introspect yourself. After all why do I believe in this?

20:31.994 --> 20:33.994
My father, grandfather followed it

20:34.018 --> 20:35.516
their father and grandfather followed it

20:35.541 --> 20:38.377
and I am limitting myself to such small beliefs

20:38.401 --> 20:43.800
and how can I enlighten the whole world?

20:43.824 --> 20:49.559
I would tell everyone, You see, pay attention to yourself, on yourself.

20:49.583 --> 20:54.790
Many people recognize Me, worship Me as Goddess, from their heart.

20:54.814 --> 20:56.869
But how it has benifitted Me?

20:56.893 --> 21:00.512
I am what I am. What is there anything special about it?

21:00.536 --> 21:02.508
I am what I am. I have not done anything.

21:02.532 --> 21:06.884
It is your greatness that you, I am so surprised that

21:06.909 --> 21:10.273
from Saraswati Tattwa you have risen to Maha Saraswati Tattwa.

21:10.298 --> 21:14.695
So it is your quality and you have got it.

21:14.719 --> 21:17.416
I neither got it nor did anything.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.710
I am telling you a very simple thing

21:19.734 --> 21:23.297
that when I see that you are surrendered to Me only

21:23.321 --> 21:27.556
I feel that you may compromise with this only

21:27.580 --> 21:30.016
that we recognize Mother.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.569
You have to recognize yourself.

21:32.593 --> 21:36.577
You have to recognize yourself and you have to raise yourself.

21:36.601 --> 21:38.746
This new era has come.

21:38.770 --> 21:43.521
the same type which I say, recently I said in Mumbai, that is also of Bodhi Sarpa.

21:43.545 --> 21:50.264
In this, you have become Budh, you have got Bodha.

21:50.289 --> 21:53.578
you have come to know what all this is.

21:53.602 --> 22:00.704
Now for this truth, light has been enlightened within you.

22:00.729 --> 22:05.839
Now this light has to ignite thousands of lights, this Bodhi Satya.

22:05.863 --> 22:08.393
If you cannot do this work

22:08.417 --> 22:12.480
then for you, for us, it is all useless effort.

22:12.504 --> 22:18.521
Because, what I am, to love Me what is the special you get?

22:18.546 --> 22:21.038
You must be feeling good to love your Mother.

22:21.063 --> 22:22.936
I also like. It is o.k.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.870
But I cannot change your direction.

22:25.895 --> 22:30.062
Love to Mother so much, I became instantaneously emmotional.

22:30.087 --> 22:34.209
I wanted to speak something, but could not.

22:34.234 --> 22:41.059
But the state beyond this is that there is joy.

22:41.146 --> 22:46.300
There is a state beyond this, which we call absolute NIRANAND.

22:46.325 --> 22:49.650
And your Mother will have Niranand only when She will see

22:49.675 --> 22:51.847
that Her children have done more work than Her.

22:51.872 --> 22:54.230
Let them get more powers than Me

22:54.254 --> 22:57.597
Mother wants that Her chidren should be more powerful than Her.

22:57.621 --> 23:01.935
But they have got stuck up in small small issues.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.271
That they should give up.

23:03.296 --> 23:07.814
And this is not here only, it is even more so among Maharashtrians.

23:07.838 --> 23:14.105
I have seen in other people also that we are stuck in small pettinesses.

23:14.129 --> 23:16.334
I call them 'Kusanskari'.

23:16.359 --> 23:20.438
A saint having good Sanskaras would immediately open his heart

23:20.463 --> 23:24.288
and like flowers start to emit fragrance.

23:24.312 --> 23:29.002
Another thing of Maha Saraswati is that it can be executed into action.

23:29.026 --> 23:35.677
In Maha Saraswati Karya you start working it out.

23:35.701 --> 23:45.185
In the Mahakali Tatwa, you absorb, you take in and imbibe.

23:45.209 --> 23:51.613
But in Maha Saraswati you start working it out.

23:51.637 --> 23:57.741
In Mahakali, you can desire, you can even create.

23:57.765 --> 24:02.711
We desire that it should be this, i want this, i want that.

24:02.735 --> 24:05.295
i like this, i like that.

24:05.319 --> 24:10.810
But to implement it, is the work of Maha Saraswati.

24:10.834 --> 24:15.026
You will say, Mother i want that Sahajyoja should spread all around.

24:15.051 --> 24:21.611
Very good! Your desire is very good! But what have you done for that?

24:21.635 --> 24:24.780
But what have you done for the sake of that?

24:24.804 --> 24:27.147
You are thinking about yourself only

24:27.172 --> 24:29.359
that it should be like this, it should be like that.

24:29.383 --> 24:31.120
And the same questions about yourself.

24:31.145 --> 24:32.734
My father is like this,my father is like that

24:32.758 --> 24:34.908
my brother is like that, his ailment is not over.

24:34.933 --> 24:39.051
His this thing is not cured, his that thing is not cured.

24:39.076 --> 24:44.433
What such work you have done

24:44.458 --> 24:50.646
on account of which Maha Saraswati Tatwa will fully evolve within you.

24:50.670 --> 24:52.119
This you should think.

24:52.144 --> 24:54.242
To how many people we have given realization?

24:54.267 --> 24:56.941
To how many people we have told about Sahajyoga?

24:56.965 --> 24:59.713
I was very happy when they told Me

24:59.738 --> 25:03.039
that here many people of Yuva Shakti.

25:03.063 --> 25:06.188
They fixed many posters, they worked for nights together.

25:06.236 --> 25:07.617
I was very happy to listen to it.

25:07.642 --> 25:10.613
And just now a senior Jounalist came to Me and said

25:10.638 --> 25:14.089
It laid a great impression on Me

25:14.114 --> 25:20.517
I saw many young boys travelling with me in the train at 1.30 a.m

25:20.541 --> 25:24.256
Some would get down and then some would get down, at the next station.

25:24.281 --> 25:25.365
They were very cool.

25:25.389 --> 25:27.344
I asked them, What are you doing?

25:27.369 --> 25:28.991
They said, We are fixing Mother's posters.

25:29.016 --> 25:31.889
He said, I have not seen such young boys till date.

25:31.913 --> 25:36.182
Such nice boys, young, educated, working so coolly.

25:36.206 --> 25:37.829
And there were some girls also with them.

25:37.854 --> 25:40.624
In a great friendly manner, all of them were sitting.

25:40.649 --> 25:45.462
Then I asked them about Sahajyoga and I was very much impressed.

25:45.486 --> 25:46.782
So it should be implemented.

25:46.806 --> 25:52.936
It means that whatever are our desires, we should work for that.

25:52.960 --> 26:01.000
Whatever we think, we should add it to our agenda.

26:01.025 --> 26:02.889
We have to show it by doing.

26:02.913 --> 26:06.661
Otherwise, it will be just talk in the air.

26:06.685 --> 26:07.317
It will be just in the air, I wanted to do this

26:07.341 --> 26:12.669
i wanted to do that, wanted to do something, i wanted to do this.

26:12.693 --> 26:17.514
Your desires will be over, when you will work.

26:17.538 --> 26:18.704
Then you will come to know that

26:18.729 --> 26:21.767
you should want only that which is possible.

26:21.792 --> 26:25.712
And that which is not possible to desire, that is destruction.

26:25.736 --> 26:26.636
And the same thing is

26:26.660 --> 26:31.348
that there is as you see now a days, the problem of joblessness.

26:31.372 --> 26:35.155
Now, here are many rich as well as poor people.

26:35.179 --> 26:37.933
When I listen to the problems of rich people

26:37.958 --> 26:41.644
I feel that they have got the same problems as that of the poor.

26:41.668 --> 26:48.989
That they say, see Mother, here we have labour problem

26:49.013 --> 26:51.757
and that is why our factories are shut down.

26:51.781 --> 26:55.069
Now, rich must think

26:55.093 --> 26:58.683
that labour is your part and parcel.

26:58.707 --> 27:01.418
You cannot do without labour.

27:01.442 --> 27:04.525
You don't want to use your hands, you are sitting on the chair only.

27:04.550 --> 27:06.889
That is called motor scanning.

27:06.914 --> 27:11.719
You did it for labour. It is not with money only.

27:11.743 --> 27:14.707
They also raised the flag and then gave the money.

27:14.731 --> 27:17.185
Then they will raise flag again and ask for money.

27:17.210 --> 27:18.773
There is no sense behind it.

27:18.797 --> 27:22.885
You worked to solve their problem.

27:22.910 --> 27:24.412
First find out

27:24.436 --> 27:27.998
For example, in Bombay it was, one gentleman came and said.

27:28.023 --> 27:30.051
I told him that if you have to get work from Marathis

27:30.076 --> 27:32.445
first make Ganpatti Temple.

27:32.469 --> 27:36.828
On this Diwali, you go to their residences and give them something.

27:36.852 --> 27:38.753
We had given (some gift) on Diwali.

27:38.778 --> 27:41.231
First understand their culture.

27:41.255 --> 27:44.371
And now here, may be great industrialists

27:44.396 --> 27:48.258
they don't know what is their culture?

27:48.282 --> 27:51.105
In their culture, what do the people believe in

27:51.130 --> 27:53.048
and what we have to understand in their culture.

27:53.073 --> 27:58.325
If they are rich people or running great industries

27:58.349 --> 28:00.919
if they understand Bengalis' state of mind.

28:00.944 --> 28:03.524
I will recognize them in a minute.

28:03.548 --> 28:08.685
They are very good at heart.

28:08.710 --> 28:10.949
That you just have a cup of tea with them

28:10.974 --> 28:13.500
and they will be your life long friends.

28:13.524 --> 28:17.595
If you show adamancy, you are great enemies.

28:17.619 --> 28:19.651
This is the speciality of Bengalis.

28:19.675 --> 28:21.706
Why do you exhibit your adamantness?

28:21.730 --> 28:26.566
Be with them, talk to them, ask them questions and know them.

28:26.591 --> 28:28.987
I call this 'enlightened entrepreneurs'.

28:29.011 --> 28:32.723
Now you are enlightened, you have come to Sahajyoga.

28:32.748 --> 28:35.263
Now you should go to their houses

28:35.287 --> 28:37.801
and see what are their problems, what do they need?

28:37.826 --> 28:43.195
You help them a little bit, they will be at your service life long.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.923
Because I have personally experienced

28:46.947 --> 28:49.772
the organization My husband was running

28:49.796 --> 28:51.911
they had lot of questions.

28:51.935 --> 28:54.344
I told them to make a family of everyone.

28:54.368 --> 28:57.272
And first of all study them, whosoever comes.

28:57.297 --> 28:59.409
Even from Calcuuta the people of Union come

28:59.434 --> 29:01.052
we serve them break fast.

29:01.077 --> 29:05.204
Talk to them, ask them, what are your questions?

29:05.228 --> 29:06.451
Then there are questions about their houses.

29:06.476 --> 29:09.249
I said, that these can be solved from your office.

29:09.273 --> 29:11.506
Make such an arrangement that they get houses.

29:11.530 --> 29:12.789
When this is done

29:12.814 --> 29:15.923
you make an arrangement for their children's education.

29:15.947 --> 29:18.165
It is not necessary that you give them raise and give them money.

29:18.189 --> 29:22.695
Because if they get money, they will straightaway go to have drinks.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.345
Or they may have two to four women.

29:24.369 --> 29:25.995
That is not going to help in any way.

29:26.019 --> 29:29.361
But if you help them really, deeply by heart

29:29.385 --> 29:34.723
and understand them by heart and think that they are your part and parcel.

29:34.747 --> 29:37.064
NOT CLEAR

29:37.088 --> 29:38.556
there should not be any falsehood in that.

29:38.580 --> 29:43.104
But by heart, you only do everything and win their heart.

29:43.128 --> 29:45.870
All your questions will be over.

29:45.894 --> 29:51.826
This country is so blessed, that there should be abundance of Lakshmi.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.987
But this is a very great question

29:54.012 --> 29:56.782
that here people do not take to Maha Saraswati Principle.

29:56.806 --> 30:00.025
Their access is only upto Saraswati Principle.

30:00.049 --> 30:03.818
When you adopt Maha Saraswati Tatwa

30:03.842 --> 30:06.448
you in this matter will get busy into it.

30:06.473 --> 30:07.786
For that it is not necessary that

30:07.810 --> 30:10.207
you do 420 activity, some hypocracy, nothing.

30:10.231 --> 30:12.907
Everything will be alright on its own

30:12.932 --> 30:14.913
Because otherwise also, you are a sahajyogi.

30:14.937 --> 30:18.588
All the work of Sahaja Yogis gets done very easily.

30:18.612 --> 30:23.033
But following Sahaj yoga rules is compulsory.

30:23.057 --> 30:32.381
NOT CLEAR

30:32.406 --> 30:37.212
and everybody should spread it.

30:37.237 --> 30:39.914
unless you ascent from inside

30:39.940 --> 30:42.565
you cannot spread it outside, however you may want.

30:42.590 --> 30:46.830
That is why in Sahajyoga, it is very important to meditate.

30:46.855 --> 30:51.802
You should meditate. I don't say , you get up at 5 a.m in the morning

30:51.826 --> 30:55.235
But you meditate for 5 minutes in the morning

30:55.260 --> 30:57.342
and for 10 minutes in the evening.

30:57.366 --> 31:00.929
And it is not that if you missed it one day, it is a great mistake

31:00.953 --> 31:05.913
but it will clense you and you will be blessed.

31:05.937 --> 31:10.352
Out of that I say , it is full time your protection.

31:10.376 --> 31:12.787
All the time you are protected.

31:12.811 --> 31:16.348
You get a full time guidance

31:16.372 --> 31:19.723
and entertainment all the time.

31:19.747 --> 31:22.058
There is nothing that will not entertain you.

31:22.083 --> 31:24.676
Yesterday I went there, all the Sahajyogis were sitting there.

31:24.701 --> 31:28.781
Amongst themselves, they were raising their kundalinis.

31:28.806 --> 31:34.294
They were leg pulling each other, talking, laughing and enjoying themselves.

31:34.318 --> 31:36.525
Again I was happy to see this.

31:36.549 --> 31:39.515
There was nothing to give any pain to anybody.

31:39.539 --> 31:41.247
and in a lot of enjoyment and happiness

31:41.271 --> 31:44.500
all of them were entertained and enjoying.

31:44.524 --> 31:51.751
In which there is enjoyment, there is uplitfment, spiritual upliftment.

31:51.776 --> 31:56.733
and which will be for the welfare of society, of country and of the universe.

31:56.758 --> 31:59.538
Such is the great work of Sahajyoga.

31:59.562 --> 32:01.844
You should workout this.

32:01.868 --> 32:07.023
As such Sahajyoga has spread in 55 countries.

32:07.047 --> 32:09.786
Even now the tatwas that are there

32:09.811 --> 32:12.737
are not even that of Mahasaraswati.

32:12.761 --> 32:18.054
All the people, all think 'Love Mother'

32:18.078 --> 32:22.039
SEVA KARO, of Mother, be busy with worshipping Mother.

32:22.063 --> 32:26.928
That is o.k, that helps you a little to have faith.

32:26.953 --> 32:31.342
That is not going to benefit you.

32:31.366 --> 32:37.164
NOT CLEAR

32:37.188 --> 32:38.701
Now depth has been attained.

32:38.725 --> 32:45.003
let us suppose that you have achieved your depth.

32:45.027 --> 32:47.327
But what is the use of that depth?

32:47.351 --> 32:54.376
What is the use of such a deep pot in which we have not to fill water?

32:54.400 --> 32:56.229
That is useless.

32:56.254 --> 32:58.741
Whether that is deep or shallow, what is the use of that?

32:58.766 --> 32:59.709
It has no utility.

32:59.733 --> 33:03.247
For whatever you have created that depth

33:03.272 --> 33:07.430
if you have to make use of it, get busy into that.

33:07.454 --> 33:13.253
what is the use of you certificates of that depth?

33:13.294 --> 33:18.147
It is possible, it is o.k, that in spiritualism

33:18.172 --> 33:20.669
people will take you as a saintly person.

33:20.693 --> 33:25.205
You are very great, cool breeze flows out of you.

33:25.230 --> 33:26.468
As I am sitting here

33:26.492 --> 33:28.775
but I don't do anything, I am inactive.

33:28.799 --> 33:32.894
It is useless, you should do something if you are inactive

33:32.918 --> 33:36.717
What is the use of such a life which makes us inactive?

33:36.741 --> 33:39.288
So, we should get busy in some or the other work.

33:39.312 --> 33:43.496
Now you must think on Agnya chakra that Mother had said

33:43.521 --> 33:45.214
So what should we do?

33:45.239 --> 33:49.400
If you go to NIRVICHAR state, you will get an inspiration from inside only

33:49.425 --> 33:53.425
that you can do this, do this, this can be done, do this.

33:53.450 --> 33:56.070
In this way only Sahajyoga is going to spread.

33:56.114 --> 33:59.006
So, the people here who are very deep.

33:59.031 --> 34:02.127
Also I felt very happy to see that they are very deep.

34:02.151 --> 34:05.721
Now we have to distribute this depth.

34:05.745 --> 34:09.960
It is of no use that few people will be deep, say like Ravinder Babu.

34:09.985 --> 34:12.223
But others will lag behind.

34:12.248 --> 34:19.106
For example, in a pond some lotuses will come out

34:19.131 --> 34:20.663
and there are some insects also.

34:20.688 --> 34:26.495
They say, see in our pond there are so many lotuses, but you are still an insect.

34:26.519 --> 34:30.373
So, even if you are so, are so many flowers, have become lotuses too

34:30.397 --> 34:32.939
what is its use to others?

34:32.963 --> 34:35.144
So, this Maha Saraswati Tatwa

34:35.169 --> 34:39.056
to which we had not paid so much attention till now.

34:39.081 --> 34:46.420
That is why I have started (to emphasize) that Maha Saraswati should be worshipped.

34:46.444 --> 34:52.218
Mahasaraswati Tatwa in our country is the creation of the Vedas.

34:52.242 --> 34:53.809
In that also, it is said that

34:53.834 --> 34:56.818
if you have not experienced 'Vidha', there is no 'Veda' also.

34:56.867 --> 34:59.584
About the creation of 'Vedas' they said that

34:59.609 --> 35:03.270
These are' Panch Mahabhoots', its work must be done beforehand.

35:03.294 --> 35:05.833
We must see them, give them realization.

35:05.858 --> 35:10.058
After giving them realization, we must utilize them.

35:10.082 --> 35:11.090
It is because of that only

35:11.115 --> 35:13.635
the science etc., came to our country.

35:13.660 --> 35:17.225
In our country, long back scientific research had taken place.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.773
In comparison to modern science

35:19.798 --> 35:21.379
in our country, science was much before

35:21.403 --> 35:22.860
because of 'Vedas'.

35:22.885 --> 35:27.176
Through vedas they attained dominion over the five elements.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.626
And you can also get it.

35:28.650 --> 35:31.129
With the help of Sahajyoga also, you can control five elements.

35:31.153 --> 35:33.085
But you move your hands.

35:33.109 --> 35:34.938
You pay your attention there.

35:34.962 --> 35:39.077
One thing is that, Mother, see my mother is sick.

35:39.101 --> 35:43.402
Oh! you are a Sahajyogi, you can cure her. use your hands.

35:43.426 --> 35:46.061
First check, if you can cure her or not?

35:46.085 --> 35:48.977
If you cannot cure her, get her to Me.

35:49.002 --> 35:50.106
What do you talk?

35:50.130 --> 35:51.338
Every thing Mother will do.

35:51.362 --> 35:53.317
If somebody is sick, Mother will cure.

35:53.342 --> 35:56.044
If there is some trouble, telephone Mother.

35:56.069 --> 35:59.417
You see, that you yourself can cure her.

35:59.441 --> 36:03.716
You put your hand on her, learn, you can do.

36:03.740 --> 36:06.620
You yourself are powerful, you have got unlimited powers.

36:06.645 --> 36:10.107
You use the powers that have been given to you.

36:10.132 --> 36:13.710
You distribute with the help of your hands.

36:13.789 --> 36:22.058
You will be surprised that your so many powers, your own powers will emit.

36:22.082 --> 36:25.666
This I repeatedly say that you yourself do something.

36:25.690 --> 36:29.616
Whosoever is there, want to put the burden on Me, is of no use.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.175
O.k I will cure , but you can do better than Me.

36:33.199 --> 36:34.775
So, why don't you do?

36:34.799 --> 36:38.908
Do it quickly. You should help each other also.

36:38.932 --> 36:40.689
Among Sahajyogis, if one is sick

36:40.713 --> 36:44.074
the other who is alright should go and help that (sick) person.

36:44.098 --> 36:47.286
Rush quickly. See that your plan works.

36:47.310 --> 36:49.643
If it doesn't work, then tell Me.

36:49.668 --> 36:55.822
And I am telling you absolutely, that you have this power all the time.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.574
And the more you use it, the more it will grow and the more it will work.

36:59.599 --> 37:02.968
and the more it will work and you will be successful.

37:02.992 --> 37:05.217
But have faith on yourself.

37:05.241 --> 37:06.860
Mother has told us so

37:06.885 --> 37:09.782
Surely it is within us, and we should take it forward.

37:09.806 --> 37:13.247
I have to tell for all of you that depth has been achieved in Sahajyoga

37:13.271 --> 37:16.880
but so far as, 'giving it (to others)' is concerned, it is a little less.

37:16.904 --> 37:19.495
Because you are very deep, I agree

37:19.520 --> 37:22.109
the Sahajyogis of our country are very deep.

37:22.133 --> 37:26.912
Now you have to start giving it to people, distribute it among people.

37:26.936 --> 37:31.481
And start making them understand and bring other people into Sahajyoga.

37:31.505 --> 37:35.701
You can cure them, you can bring them into balance.

37:35.725 --> 37:40.414
When you will get busy into it, when Maha Saraswari Tatwa will be awakened

37:40.438 --> 37:43.420
you will be amazed

37:43.444 --> 37:47.047
that how much this country has progressed.

37:47.071 --> 37:54.730
But this disease of laziness is there throughout India, not only here.

37:54.770 --> 37:56.462
Everybody is lazy.

37:56.486 --> 38:01.795
And there are so many excuses, why don't we do?

38:01.819 --> 38:05.662
We don't do because of this, because of that.

38:05.686 --> 38:07.896
Even in Sahajyoga, people make lot of excuses.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.795
Now if you start working without telling excuses

38:11.819 --> 38:13.169
For example, somebody will say

38:13.194 --> 38:17.596
We had gone there but there the sheet was not clean.

38:17.621 --> 38:19.696
So you clean it.

38:19.721 --> 38:24.532
To make some excuses, it was so , that is why it could not be done.

38:24.556 --> 38:30.038
or that we are afraid of our society, or that we are afraid of our brother.

38:30.062 --> 38:31.402
Because of such scared people

38:31.427 --> 38:34.060
neither there can be betterment of them nor of Sahajyoga.

38:34.084 --> 38:37.536
Sahajyoga is not for cowards, it is for brave people.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.057
And you should volunteer yourself.

38:40.081 --> 38:42.020
You should come forward.

38:42.044 --> 38:46.464
You should invite everyone, you should give challenge, 'come and see.'

38:46.488 --> 38:48.026
Then it will work out.

38:48.050 --> 38:53.252
Because you are noticing how much bkack magic has spread in Bengal.

38:53.276 --> 38:57.205
Since I came, I see how much black magic is here.

38:57.229 --> 38:59.657
Since yesterday, I am just clearing it, clearing it out.

38:59.681 --> 39:04.186
Whosoever I see, says, I am sad, he is sad, they are sad.

39:04.211 --> 39:08.344
If everybody is sad, what is sadness?

39:08.368 --> 39:10.685
Whosoever I see says, my foot broke, i am sad

39:10.710 --> 39:12.876
my head is paining, i am sad.

39:12.900 --> 39:17.012
So this poverty is also because of this black magic.

39:17.036 --> 39:20.004
You should get rid of this black magic.

39:20.028 --> 39:24.381
And for this you should have some special thing.

39:24.406 --> 39:27.830
If you also say, i belong to this religion, i belong to that religion

39:27.854 --> 39:31.660
I am disciple of this guru, I am diciple of that guru, this is my guru.

39:31.684 --> 39:34.951
You have photographs of these gurus and all this

39:34.976 --> 39:38.308
of which you do not have any good experience till now

39:38.332 --> 39:41.609
whom you have not seen, not heard of, don't know him

39:41.634 --> 39:44.624
what is the use of running after such people?

39:44.648 --> 39:48.590
The person who is in front of you, accept him and get busy in that.

39:48.614 --> 39:55.622
So today's puja according to Me should be for the whole of India.

39:55.646 --> 39:58.926
This disease is in whole of India.

39:58.950 --> 40:02.536
We are active. You are not avtive at all.

40:02.560 --> 40:09.391
What we are, we have lot of desires, lot of desires.

40:09.415 --> 40:13.005
For example there are politicians, 'i will do this , i will do that'.

40:13.030 --> 40:16.235
But as soon as they occupy their seats, they forget

40:16.260 --> 40:19.855
and have no desire except earning money.

40:19.893 --> 40:22.207
It should not be so in Sahajyoga.

40:22.231 --> 40:24.303
In Sahajyoga we have to work.

40:24.327 --> 40:27.931
And for working it out, what we have to do? We have to discuss.

40:27.955 --> 40:32.214
For this, you meet, discuss among yourselves what we have to do?

40:32.238 --> 40:34.010
What can we do?

40:34.034 --> 40:36.621
How can we take it forward?

40:36.645 --> 40:41.025
There is nothing in Sahajyoga which that picks up speed.

40:41.049 --> 40:43.276
We purchased this land for the sake of experiments.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.319
purchased the other, is rotting

40:45.344 --> 40:47.734
bought another land but is just lying there rotting.

40:47.758 --> 40:52.332
Till I don't come to India, not even a small path can be made.

40:52.356 --> 40:55.110
Not even a small hut can be constructed.

40:55.134 --> 41:00.727
I can't understand, even when there are so many people, no work is done.

41:00.751 --> 41:05.497
When I go, you disburse and get separated.

41:05.521 --> 41:08.571
And only two to four people work.

41:08.595 --> 41:12.400
Sahajyoga is a collective work.

41:12.424 --> 41:14.839
It is not the job of only two to four people only

41:14.863 --> 41:20.325
that just one or two people can do it.

41:20.428 --> 41:22.078
This also is important to understand.

41:22.102 --> 41:24.229
Only one person is doing everything.

41:24.254 --> 41:26.711
only one person is running, it can't be like this.

41:26.735 --> 41:30.663
Everybody has to get organized like the parts of a body.

41:30.687 --> 41:35.530
Not Clear

41:35.554 --> 41:39.113
A Sahajyogi is the part of one Sahajyoga.

41:39.137 --> 41:46.752
Imagine, there is something wrong with the finger itself.

41:46.777 --> 41:49.156
All over the body there will be pain definitely.

41:49.181 --> 41:55.862
But if this finger is finished, then from where can we get another one?

41:55.887 --> 41:57.897
Once you have come to Sahaja Yoga

41:57.922 --> 42:00.892
everything is Sahaja no doubt about that.

42:00.917 --> 42:04.203
But one thing that is Sahaj of all, does not go away

42:04.228 --> 42:07.266
and that is the small mindedness

42:07.291 --> 42:12.910
and this ignorance about being special people.

42:12.934 --> 42:18.611
I have only one great thing to tell all of you, out of love

42:18.636 --> 42:24.824
that all of you have  gained and achieved so much of depth, in Sahaja Yoga

42:24.849 --> 42:27.138
and now you should start spreading it.

42:27.163 --> 42:30.311
Till the time, the lamp is not lit

42:30.336 --> 42:35.593
we give it light and say that it is now enlightenend.

42:35.618 --> 42:39.818
But even after that if it asks for the light, what can one say?

42:39.843 --> 42:42.282
Now the enlightenend lamp should give light to others.

42:42.307 --> 42:44.124
Today you are listening to Me.

42:44.149 --> 42:47.436
Tomorrow you can sit in My place and do My work.

42:47.461 --> 42:50.233
When this happens only then Sahaja Yoga wil grow.

42:50.258 --> 42:54.099
Wherever this has happened, Sahaja Yoga has spread in those countries.

42:54.124 --> 43:00.133
I bless you that now many people may emerge after this puja and do this work.

43:00.158 --> 43:03.384
This is My eternal blessings.
