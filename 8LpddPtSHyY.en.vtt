1999-0508 Entertainment Program,
Sahastrara Puja Weekend, Cabella, Italy

02:42:57.114 --> 02:43:04.953
Sometimes the words fail to express

02:43:07.371 --> 02:43:15.248
the feelings of great gratitude for all
of you -

02:43:15.748 --> 02:43:20.272
for putting up this collective effort

02:43:20.473 --> 02:43:30.980
and such a beautiful concentrated work
as a real piece of art.

02:43:31.181 --> 02:43:37.863
I had seen “Magic Flute” long time back,
when I was in Berlin,

02:43:38.064 --> 02:43:45.616
and that time – of course I didn’t
understand German language,

02:43:45.817 --> 02:43:54.721
but I absolutely got lost by the rhythm,
the music, the tuning and everything.

02:43:54.922 --> 02:43:59.714
So, actually the way you have brought
in that

02:43:59.915 --> 02:44:06.209
very, very beautiful piece of art to life –

02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:12.876
I feel so much grateful to you that you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

02:44:13.077 --> 02:44:24.204
and to Sahaja Yogis to perform this kind
of magnificent, tremendous art piece,

02:44:24.405 --> 02:44:31.053
I don’t know whom to thank, really.
Because now I can see our future,

02:44:31.254 --> 02:44:36.983
we’ll be going all over the world,
taking this music.

02:44:37.184 --> 02:44:42.029
And may not be this one, may be
another one,

02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:49.426
but you are all such a great group that
you can really surpass everybody else

02:44:49.627 --> 02:44:53.767
who are having all these operas everywhere.

02:44:53.968 --> 02:44:58.876
Actually I would say in London it’s very
easy to get that hall

02:44:59.077 --> 02:45:03.824
which is mostly used for operas,
the Royal Albert Hall.

02:45:04.025 --> 02:45:10.570
So we can reserve for you that, and we’ll
have the whole thing done.

02:45:10.771 --> 02:45:17.085
I mean, I could never imagine that
you were such masters.

02:45:17.364 --> 02:45:22.345
I shouldn’t say professionals, but
really masters.

02:45:22.546 --> 02:45:28.439
And the way you all concentrated. This is
the main point of collective playing

02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:31.935
is that there should be complete
concentration.

02:45:32.136 --> 02:45:37.512
I just wanted to test you, so I said,
“Sing also Binati Suniye”.

02:45:37.713 --> 02:45:40.977
But despite that you came back
to your normal

02:45:41.178 --> 02:45:44.710
and you were doing everything so well,
even after that;

02:45:44.911 --> 02:45:49.571
I don’t know how to congratulate you
and all of you

02:45:49.772 --> 02:45:59.348
who have taken to it, worked together,
in such unison and with such clarity.

02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:08.143
I must say, I would say it was even better
than the one I had seen, much better.

02:46:09.185 --> 02:46:15.738
You see, because I couldn’t even understand
the language, apart from that,

02:46:15.939 --> 02:46:21.304
it was little they, I felt, they were
little confused comparatively,

02:46:21.505 --> 02:46:25.627
while you people were straight, absolutely
could see what you were doing,

02:46:25.828 --> 02:46:30.727
and what you were performing, and what
you were giving.

02:46:30.895 --> 02:46:34.660
Now I see your future, the future
of Sahaja Yoga.

02:46:34.861 --> 02:46:39.330
Through you people, the glory of Sahaja
Yoga will spread.

02:46:39.531 --> 02:46:44.989
But when we have the program we’ll have
all formal dresses and all formalities,

02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:49.658
and I’m sure - I bless you from My heart -
that we’ll have the complete

02:46:49.859 --> 02:47:00.049
of this particular play by Mozart.
Complete.

02:47:00.250 --> 02:47:06.518
And we’ll do it so well, I know, and people
will know that what Sahaja Yoga can do

02:47:06.719 --> 02:47:13.094
to your collectivity by which you can
achieve it – because this collectivity

02:47:13.295 --> 02:47:17.746
you can’t have in any other form
of performance.

02:47:17.947 --> 02:47:23.602
This has to be all of you, the players,
singers,

02:47:23.803 --> 02:47:27.678
then the dialogues and everything
has to be in unison.

02:47:27.879 --> 02:47:33.701
In Maharashtra, in Marathi, we have dramas
of this kind,

02:47:33.902 --> 02:47:39.798
which can be called as operas, but apart
from that, there is lot of –

02:47:39.999 --> 02:47:48.540
what you can say – dialogues which are not
in the tune or in the music form.

02:47:48.741 --> 02:47:53.422
So also they speak and tell you something
in between.

02:47:53.623 --> 02:48:01.512
But they are also very enjoyable and they
are thinking of having opera in Maharashtra.

02:48:01.713 --> 02:48:05.508
But now let – when they’ll see you then
I think they’ll give up the idea,

02:48:05.709 --> 02:48:08.993
they can’t do that well, I’m sure.

02:48:09.194 --> 02:48:16.355
In any case Austria is a place, is the –
I think is the origin, is the distribution,

02:48:16.556 --> 02:48:24.137
is the complete sky of Western classical
music, no doubt about it.

02:48:24.338 --> 02:48:29.183
And you all are all really based into it.

02:48:29.384 --> 02:48:34.371
The way you have played and the way
you have sung

02:48:34.572 --> 02:48:37.844
is very remarkable, it has touched
My heart.

02:48:38.045 --> 02:48:43.536
I wish you had the complete seventy-five
minutes program,

02:48:43.737 --> 02:48:49.153
but the problem is that supposing you have
one day for this, then it’s all right.

02:48:49.354 --> 02:48:57.596
No, as it is, we have only two days in that
this cannot be fully expressed.

02:48:57.797 --> 02:49:03.862
But we’ll arrange a program, we’ll
definitely arrange a program

02:49:04.063 --> 02:49:07.812
in, say, Albert Hall I think, it’s easy
to get.

02:49:08.013 --> 02:49:10.852
I [mean] we get it every time, again
we’ll get this time.

02:49:11.053 --> 02:49:14.458
And I’m sure they will be very impressed.

02:49:14.659 --> 02:49:20.101
Because they don’t know what music
you have in your country

02:49:20.302 --> 02:49:24.870
and how much people know and how much
they can sing so well.

02:49:25.071 --> 02:49:31.253
It’s something very rare, you don’t
understand, I feel it because

02:49:31.454 --> 02:49:36.602
I must say I’m not so much used to operas,

02:49:36.803 --> 02:49:41.797
and whatever operas I have seen, this is
thousand times better than that.

02:49:41.998 --> 02:49:46.871
So I’m really amazed at your achievement.
I don’t know if it is Sahaj Yog

02:49:47.072 --> 02:49:54.071
that has helped you, but this collective,
collective singing, is the biggest thing.

02:49:54.272 --> 02:49:57.477
Collective, in tune with all other
musicians,

02:49:57.678 --> 02:50:02.079
it’s really very, very great and this
unison, this oneness,

02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:07.241
if it is through Sahaj Yog, I’m very happy
about it.

02:50:07.442 --> 02:50:12.247
We are all overly satisfied and I can see
your future –

02:50:12.448 --> 02:50:18.899
it will be a great future for all of you.
We shouldn’t take so much of botheration

02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:25.059
about how we’ll do it and how will it work
out – it will, it will work out.

02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:29.719
Your desire is much stronger than
the desire of any other artist.

02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:34.230
So just desire, it will all work out and
we’ll show to them

02:50:34.431 --> 02:50:39.831
how Sahaja Yoga can create such
beautiful music.

02:50:40.032 --> 02:50:46.616
So thank you very much, and I thank from
all others the way you have entertained us

02:50:46.817 --> 02:50:56.288
with this beautiful music and such great
hopes of a future expressions of your art.

02:50:56.489 --> 02:50:59.743
May God bless you.

02:51:03.265 --> 02:51:13.224
Then Slovakia people are also another
very great geniuses,

02:51:13.425 --> 02:51:19.691
yesterday we saw their drama and today
again we saw – I’m amazed absolutely.

02:51:19.892 --> 02:51:25.865
Is it Sahaja Yoga that has made them so
good in art? The creativity was so great

02:51:26.066 --> 02:51:33.060
and their play, drama was so beautiful.
So beautifully rendered;

02:51:33.261 --> 02:51:38.678
yesterday also, today also. I mean, they
are such dramatist I didn’t know, I mean,

02:51:38.879 --> 02:51:44.757
how could they be that confident
of their acting and everything,

02:51:44.958 --> 02:51:50.198
is really remarkable. When I was young
I used to act also in dramas,

02:51:50.399 --> 02:51:57.606
and I used to get first prize mostly.
Maybe I quite

02:51:58.631 --> 02:52:05.586
disguised Myself as something else,
but the, you see, the art,

02:52:05.787 --> 02:52:11.253
art of acting was so great even with them,

02:52:11.454 --> 02:52:16.306
I was surprised how they could freely
act so well.

02:52:16.507 --> 02:52:21.986
Again I would say if it is Sahaj Yog,
carry on, carry on with Sahaja Yoga.

02:52:22.187 --> 02:52:28.594
And I’m sure this creativity, the blessings
of Saraswati will be upon you;

02:52:28.795 --> 02:52:36.928
and we’ll have even bigger dramas
and bigger -

02:52:37.129 --> 02:52:43.218
we should say – expositions somewhere,
maybe later on

02:52:43.419 --> 02:52:49.713
we can have it in India, or have it
in America, anywhere.

02:52:49.914 --> 02:52:57.005
So I see all that before Me, and you’ll be
very well-known artists, all of you;

02:52:57.206 --> 02:53:07.324
even the Slovakia people have great talent
I must say. Such a great talent!

02:53:07.525 --> 02:53:14.211
This talent is a special gift of God, no
doubt. But to combine it, to express it,

02:53:14.412 --> 02:53:20.141
to work it out in such a collective manner,
is something very different

02:53:20.342 --> 02:53:26.933
and very beautiful, and it really made Me
feel very confident about you people,

02:53:27.134 --> 02:53:30.884
that one day through you Sahaja Yoga
will spread all over the world,

02:53:31.085 --> 02:53:38.207
and people will start knowing this Sahaj
orchestra and Sahaj artists.

02:53:38.408 --> 02:53:45.443
It’s really great, very great, and I bless
you from My heart for that.

02:53:47.621 --> 02:53:52.017
Then we had some other programs of this,
like Kathak dance,

02:53:52.218 --> 02:53:57.027
and also I’m amazed that a German girl
can dance so well that Kathak.

02:53:57.228 --> 02:54:02.210
It’s not easy, it’s very difficult. And
rhythmic sense, and all the expression

02:54:02.411 --> 02:54:06.990
and everything – she was so delicately
doing it, I was surprised.

02:54:07.191 --> 02:54:11.066
I never thought that German girls could
be that delicate, but really,

02:54:11.267 --> 02:54:15.307
they are so delicate and so beautifully
expressing

02:54:15.513 --> 02:54:24.515
the, all the delicacies of a lady
in her dancing, is…

02:54:24.716 --> 02:54:32.055
All – I don’t want to take your time
describing all of them,

02:54:32.256 --> 02:54:36.760
but one after another every program
has been great.

02:54:36.961 --> 02:54:45.111
And the way you are now depicting
those great musicians

02:54:45.311 --> 02:54:50.426
is something very creditable. Because world
has forgotten them.

02:54:50.634 --> 02:54:55.192
They want pop music, cheap music,
easy music –

02:54:55.393 --> 02:55:00.198
but once you start establishing it,
the vibrations will flow

02:55:00.399 --> 02:55:07.463
and people will realise how great this
music was and was lost.

02:55:07.664 --> 02:55:11.071
So this trend that is in the whole world

02:55:11.272 --> 02:55:18.667
is to become cheapish and to become
something very, very superficial,

02:55:18.868 --> 02:55:24.386
will be curbed by your own dedication
and your own expressions,

02:55:24.587 --> 02:55:28.175
which will definitely make the vibrations
flow to the audience,

02:55:28.376 --> 02:55:33.703
and they will enjoy it very much.
Because you are now divine people,

02:55:33.904 --> 02:55:39.161
so your rendering is very different from
others, at least I felt that way.

02:55:39.362 --> 02:55:44.222
I felt – gave Me such great joy,
such great joy

02:55:44.423 --> 02:55:47.893
that I didn’t get from all other operas
I have seen,

02:55:48.094 --> 02:55:55.811
and somehow I couldn’t understand
the way they were

02:55:56.012 --> 02:56:00.828
quite confused I felt, not so well
organized as you people are.

02:56:01.029 --> 02:56:05.358
So, My blessings again and again
for all of you,

02:56:05.559 --> 02:56:12.981
and the way this program has been arranged
by these countries is I’m thankful to them,

02:56:13.182 --> 02:56:20.011
to their leaders, and to all of them that
they have done a very great job.

02:56:20.212 --> 02:56:23.735
So many people have come from other
countries also here,

02:56:23.936 --> 02:56:31.079
and they should also take a lesson,
and try to develop this style

02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:37.769
of combining music and expressing
their great,

02:56:37.970 --> 02:56:42.117
very great artists, that they have their
own compound (? Unclear word).

02:56:42.318 --> 02:56:52.934
I’m trying to get one of our Indian
if you say an opera-style thing here,

02:56:53.135 --> 02:56:58.696
but it’s very difficult to get so many
people. But you would enjoy that, really.

02:56:58.897 --> 02:57:04.558
So let us see if I could manage sometime
a group of people who will come

02:57:04.759 --> 02:57:08.444
and give you a kind of an opera
as you have.

02:57:08.645 --> 02:57:12.152
Thank you very much.
