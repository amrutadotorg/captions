00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.870
It’s very nice to see all of you here, so
many of you from Australia,

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:13.809
to worship Shiva, Sadashiva.

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.985
I think this is a very important occasion.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.658
Is important, because Sadashiva,

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:40.964
the God Almighty, who is One,

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:47.276
is expressed on your heart as Spirit, the Shiva.

00:00:53.621 --> 00:01:04.985
We have to understand that so many people
came on this earth at different times, in

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:16.530
different countries, and they talked to different
people about righteousness, that is dharma,

00:01:19.743 --> 00:01:22.543
about how to elevate yourself,

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:27.951
and all of them have said that you have to be reborn,

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:33.762
that is, you have to become the Spirit.

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:35.644
They have all

00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:48.473
said the same thing because they knew, without

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:59.342
the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:04.688
you will not be able to understand spirituality.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.340
You have the Spirit within you,

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.356
which is all the time in a witness state.

00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:32.432
Why all the religions have failed?

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.863
Because they did not get their Self-Realization.

00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.976
They did not become the Spirit.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:50.122
So there's a tremendous difference between you and all others

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:54.588
who profess something. It looks as if they are hypocrites.

00:02:56.045 --> 00:03:01.868
They intellectualize it as you know, they explain it very well,

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.220
but you can see very clearly
that they haven't absorbed spirituality.

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:17.587
That absorption was impossible without Self-Realization.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.191
This everybody felt.

00:03:22.778 --> 00:03:27.177
Buddha went to this limit and Mahavira both, to say that,

00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:29.603
forget about God,

00:03:29.932 --> 00:03:32.208
forget about God Almighty,

00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:36.845
you just get your Self, your Self-Realization.

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:40.967
So they are called as atheist in Idikshavadi,

00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:43.407
they don't believe in Ishwara,

00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:50.013
but they felt that the way
people are just talking about God Almighty

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:52.858
and what the books have said.

00:03:53.946 --> 00:04:00.105
These books also speak of righteousness,

00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:05.592
except in some books there has been some sort of interference,

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:11.086
but most of them speak of spirituality

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:14.216
and what you have to achieve,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.943
what is the purpose of religion.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.692
All that is spoken very well, written very well.

00:04:29.984 --> 00:04:33.845
They'll tell you, “You have to be this, you have to be that,

00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:36.858
this is not good, that is not good.”

00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:42.281
So even the first state, where the dharma has to be established,

00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:51.468
was not established:
where people are not supposed to cheat each other,

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:58.513
there has to be justice, there has to be collectivity,

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:05.967
there has to be love and understanding, no jealousies,

00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:13.683
no hypocrisy; where it's a different race,

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:15.380
a different community,

00:05:15.693 --> 00:05:19.930
we can call it a different civilization is to be created.

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:25.570
Everybody claims that they are the chosen ones,

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:28.579
but they are just the same.

00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:34.484
There's a tremendous achievement of Sahaja Yogis

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:38.664
that they have achieved this state of Spirit.

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:44.174
So now you can absorb dharma without any difficulties,

00:05:44.514 --> 00:05:49.534
without any difficulties. You would not like to cheat anyone,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.920
you'd not like to kill anyone,

00:05:52.347 --> 00:05:55.508
you'd not like to be violent with anyone.

00:05:56.109 --> 00:06:00.621
You will stick on to the truth, the truth,

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.637
very few people can stick on to the truth.

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:12.049
Then you are not people who are going to rob others,

00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:19.485
you have no intention at all, doesn't come into your mind

00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:23.723
that you are tempted to take away things from others.

00:06:26.508 --> 00:06:29.986
First of all, which is the most important thing,

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.194
that you have a rapport with God Almighty;

00:06:36.677 --> 00:06:42.082
that you are, in a way, in awe about God.

00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:47.719
There is awe, not I would say fear,

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.095
because fear is all dispelled, there's no more fear for you,

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:58.461
but you have awe for God, that He is God Almighty.

00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:06.527
You won't cheat people, you won't cheat Sahaja Yoga for money,

00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:18.532
you won't fight for power or for something that is material.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.258
All your attention will be towards

00:07:23.656 --> 00:07:28.279
the expansion of your awareness in the light of the Spirit.

00:07:29.104 --> 00:07:32.644
This is the vision of your Mother,

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:37.144
because Shiva is just a witness,

00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:40.725
Sadashiva is just witnessing all this play.

00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:44.932
He doesn't have any visions about it,

00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:48.836
but now He must have lots of hopes after seeing

00:07:49.596 --> 00:07:53.596
the kind of people that are created out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:54.148 --> 00:08:00.393
Very unique, very beautiful,
wonderful angel-like people have been created.

00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:07.508
Now only problem is that
you have to keep to your angelic foundations;

00:08:08.812 --> 00:08:14.127
but I find that sometimes it happens, doesn't matter,

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.903
that you fall, and falter.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:27.810
Again, you rise into your awareness and try to locate

00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:39.664
the new dimensions that are available to you,
that you can find out.

00:08:41.095 --> 00:08:48.095
All this is possible because now
you belong really to the chosen ones’ race.

00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:52.894
You must know also that you are very special people.

00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:57.191
It is not realized sometimes by Sahaja Yogis.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.132
They have no self-esteem as to what they have got.

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:07.214
Once you have self-esteem,

00:09:07.603 --> 00:09:14.603
you will have the wisdom to understand
what is your role in this lifetime.

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:21.331
This self-esteem is only possible

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:28.483
if you see other people who are lost in the mire of nonsense.

00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:33.595
Now you are a special community I said,

00:09:33.777 --> 00:09:40.057
you are the one who are going to create that great community.

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:52.646
Now whatever are the dharma’s

00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:59.163
points, or we can say dharma’s aspects,

00:10:00.128 --> 00:10:06.089
you can imbibe them Sahaj. “Sahaj” has a very special meaning:

00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:09.865
Spontaneously, you do not have to exert,

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:18.348
you do not have to go into a penance or work it out.

00:10:19.963 --> 00:10:25.334
In a Sahaj way you can do it. “Sahaj” also means easy.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.422
You can have it in your heart, all these qualities,

00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:33.517
without any difficulty whatsoever.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.634
It's the easiest thing for you
to be righteous than to be otherwise.

00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:45.473
It's easier for you to be honest than to be otherwise.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:56.712
So this speciality that you have got
is the vision of all the saints, of all the prophets,

00:10:56.947 --> 00:11:02.425
of all the seers, of all the Incarnations,

00:11:05.453 --> 00:11:09.886
There are lectures and lectures people give,
“You must do like this, you must do that way.”

00:11:10.986 --> 00:11:17.173
They think that by educating people into
these principles people will be all right, they cannot.

00:11:19.357 --> 00:11:24.014
If you try to educate them, it will go as an ego into their heads,

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:28.089
because you get educated only through your ego.

00:11:29.307 --> 00:11:34.976
Is not Sahaj, is not Sahaj sustenance, Sahaja dharana,

00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:39.702
it is something that is put

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.099
onto you from outside,

00:11:43.312 --> 00:11:50.316
but for you it is very easy, that you can imbibe

00:11:50.727 --> 00:11:54.285
all the aspects of dharma very easily.

00:11:54.591 --> 00:11:57.597
You don't have to do anything, you will not just do it.

00:11:58.005 --> 00:12:01.546
I've known people who used to take drugs,

00:12:02.272 --> 00:12:08.142
who used to abuse people, beat. There's one fellow,
he said he used to carry a revolver always with him.

00:12:08.403 --> 00:12:13.514
He's become such a quiet, silent, beautiful person

00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:18.423
that unbelievable, but his wife tells Me that he was like this.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.823
So now you are that special people,

00:12:22.674 --> 00:12:28.354
and those people who have not got their Realization

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:33.137
cannot get to dharma easily.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:41.888
Then the second point which is very easy for you

00:12:42.534 --> 00:12:49.534
is to love another person, to care for another person.

00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:55.594
Is very easy, you would love to do that.

00:12:57.264 --> 00:13:04.719
You would love to care for people who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:05.502 --> 00:13:07.973
also who are non-SahajaYogis.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.673
Sahaja Yoga is quite flexible.

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:15.341
If you see somebody who is a non-SahajaYogi

00:13:15.788 --> 00:13:19.957
and also suffering, you would immediately jump

00:13:21.704 --> 00:13:25.658
to see that that person gets help from you.

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:31.852
I have seen people in Sahaja Yoga, very interesting they are.

00:13:34.585 --> 00:13:41.022
One gentleman came to Me and said,
“Mother I have no money, I want to go

00:13:42.046 --> 00:13:44.737
and do some work for Sahaja Yoga

00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:49.219
but I have no money, even I have no money for the household.”

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:54.049
I said, “All right, that's very good, you come tomorrow,
I'll give you the money.”

00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:58.877
Next day he never came. I said, “What's the matter?”

00:14:00.262 --> 00:14:04.988
He said, “There was somebody
sitting with You that time when I was talking with You,

00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:08.283
if You remember.”
I said, “I don't remember so clearly.”

00:14:08.426 --> 00:14:10.974
“All right, I also don't know him,

00:14:11.122 --> 00:14:15.098
as soon as I went out he said, ‘How much money do you want?’

00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:17.275
I told him, ‘At least this much.’

00:14:17.422 --> 00:14:20.892
Immediately he took out the money and gave it to me.”

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:26.373
So who haven't got something in Sahaja Yoga, who hasn't got money,

00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:30.276
immediately we run to help that person.

00:14:30.526 --> 00:14:35.705
Like you'll be amazed that there are these six countries like

00:14:35.825 --> 00:14:41.616
Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Poland,

00:14:45.823 --> 00:14:57.530
Czechoslovakia, all these countries, even Hungary, have been helped

00:14:59.237 --> 00:15:01.889
by one country or other,

00:15:02.966 --> 00:15:06.700
even the East Asian countries are helped by Australians.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.035
I never told them, I never asked them,

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.764
I never said that, “You have to help.”

00:15:12.914 --> 00:15:17.289
They just came forward that
“Mother, somehow we have to help them,

00:15:17.618 --> 00:15:23.896
we'll arrange, we'll get to them,
we'll manage this, we'll do that.” It's very surprising,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.447
how they could just think of helping those countries.

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:36.389
Then they made tickets for them,

00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:40.318
they brought them to India. They looked after,

00:15:40.512 --> 00:15:44.411
Russians came to India, were looked after.

00:15:44.668 --> 00:15:47.647
Everybody was so full of compassion and love

00:15:47.772 --> 00:15:50.436
but without feeling they have done anything, without feeling

00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:53.596
in any way that they have done any obligation to someone.

00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:58.841
Nobody expected them to thank them
and write letters of thanks or anything.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:03.126
Whatever is done is finished now, that's...

00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:09.429
Nobody ever asked how much money was given,

00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:14.084
how much was spent, how much we had to give, nothing of the kind.

00:16:14.322 --> 00:16:18.313
At that spur of the moment everybody
come forward, they gave the money

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:22.363
and the thing worked out. It was very surprising.

00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:29.254
For example France, France is looking after Romania.

00:16:29.734 --> 00:16:33.319
I didn't know they had done so much of work in Romania.

00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:39.430
I reached Hungary and suddenly
I find hundred-and-twenty-five Romanians there.

00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:44.067
My heart was really filled with such joy.
I said, “How are you here?”

00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:48.797
“French have arranged everything for us, Mother.”
“Really?”

00:16:49.088 --> 00:16:52.879
There were no French people there, no-one from France.

00:16:53.027 --> 00:16:55.817
And Romanians were singing so well

00:16:56.094 --> 00:17:00.170
that the Indians felt that,
“Oh wah, what is this, a new group has started?”

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:03.211
All of them, and they never used books, without

00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:05.910
using the books they were singing, these Romanians.

00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:08.584
So I said, “Where are you going to stay in the night?”

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.988
“We'll stay in a garden Mother, it's all right.”

00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:15.160
But I said, “How?” “We'll stay there, doesn't matter.”

00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:17.629
How secretly they helped.

00:17:17.754 --> 00:17:23.151
If I had not asked them, I would not have known how they have come.

00:17:24.718 --> 00:17:27.839
So this, to help the people who do not have,

00:17:27.953 --> 00:17:31.864
you can call them sort of a,
you can say those who are poorer than us.

00:17:35.026 --> 00:17:42.217
I have seen also people, how individually they look after others,

00:17:44.004 --> 00:17:49.936
and bring things for their friends, presents

00:17:52.408 --> 00:17:57.025
and beautiful things, just for their own satisfaction,

00:17:57.913 --> 00:18:00.589
not to oblige anyone or to

00:18:00.977 --> 00:18:03.888
later on say, “Oh I brought this sari for you.” Nothing,

00:18:04.037 --> 00:18:07.103
just to see that sari on another Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:09.245 --> 00:18:11.314
It's such a beautiful thing.

00:18:12.028 --> 00:18:16.881
Imagine these countries like England, France, Spain,

00:18:20.184 --> 00:18:26.427
Italy, Switzerland, very aggressive, very aggressive people.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.321
When they went out, not to help anyone

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:33.779
but to establish their empire

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.400
or to destroy people, or to convert them or do
all kinds of things in the name of religion, in the name of God.

00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:47.368
But, when you go to other countries, you just want to help,

00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:51.753
give them all the help that is needed.

00:18:52.147 --> 00:18:57.510
I am Myself amazed how it works out so spontaneous in your heart

00:18:57.628 --> 00:19:01.374
that you should do this and you should work it out.

00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:09.391
This transformation that has taken place within you

00:19:09.713 --> 00:19:15.585
has brought out all the beauty of your heart,
of your compassion, of your love.

00:19:15.975 --> 00:19:18.997
And you give, want to give security to others,

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.420
without expecting anything, without demanding anything.

00:19:24.305 --> 00:19:26.853
And you all enjoy it, doing that,

00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:30.434
living in a simple place like this,

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:34.968
under a tent, sitting, listening to Me,

00:19:35.434 --> 00:19:41.284
you don't want any comfort, just seek the comfort of your Spirit

00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:44.767
and enjoy the whole place, the Nature.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.958
Gradually I have seen also Sahaja Yogis are becoming

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:55.570
extremely conscious of the ecological problem all over the world.

00:19:57.755 --> 00:20:01.554
They have started using things which are natural,

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.946
which are artistic. It's something so surprising

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.764
that suddenly they have taken to artistic things.

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.649
I know of a gentleman

00:20:15.191 --> 00:20:19.780
who had arms, ammunitions in his house, everything like that,

00:20:20.744 --> 00:20:23.794
but now he has beautiful things.

00:20:24.886 --> 00:20:28.421
Of course the arms and ammunition are on one side

00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:32.057
but such beautiful artistic things he has collected.

00:20:32.604 --> 00:20:35.010
So I said, “How did you get this?”

00:20:35.162 --> 00:20:36.871
He said, “Mother I was thinking

00:20:36.974 --> 00:20:39.613
that You would like to see them and You'll feel happy,

00:20:39.704 --> 00:20:42.391
so I have bought for You to see,

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.722
and if You want You can take anything.”
I said, “I don't want anything,

00:20:46.836 --> 00:20:48.769
you can keep it to yourself.”

00:20:49.893 --> 00:20:53.363
So this generosity, we’ll call it adhari,

00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:56.853
is a sign of an Incarnation.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.218
But this generosity is among My own children now.

00:21:01.659 --> 00:21:03.935
They’re extremely generous,

00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:10.350
and they enjoy giving things to other,
than to in keeping things to themselves.

00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:13.741
It has happened not only in Australia,

00:21:13.889 --> 00:21:16.222
it has happened all over the world.

00:21:16.473 --> 00:21:24.509
If you see the Sahaja Yogis, how they are sacrificing

00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:27.788
their time, their money and everything

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:31.802
to spread Sahaja Yoga, to help others,

00:21:32.182 --> 00:21:35.365
and to accommodate all kinds of things,

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.764
all kinds of people within themselves.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:47.177
Such wisdom, such collective wisdom is there.

00:21:47.892 --> 00:21:50.892
We don't have to take any consensus.

00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:55.251
We don't have to say that “You all must say this” or

00:21:55.437 --> 00:21:58.415
“What is your opinion? Will you vote for it?”

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.853
Everyone votes for the same.

00:22:01.103 --> 00:22:05.488
If somebody says, “All right, we have to give some

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:11.069
help to, say, Bulgaria”, in Italy,

00:22:11.715 --> 00:22:16.765
immediately all the Italians
brought out their ornaments, everything there.

00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:21.331
“Mother, how much should wesend?” I said,” It's your lookout.”

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.156
And the Bulgarians are surprised also

00:22:24.994 --> 00:22:27.772
that, “What have we done for these Italians

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.437
that they should come down all the way to

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.963
help us out with money, every kind of thing?”

00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:40.168
So this compassion, this love,

00:22:40.477 --> 00:22:44.760
this feeling of oneness, as if they are part and parcel of us,

00:22:44.976 --> 00:22:50.665
we are not separate. For Russia, you'll be surprised

00:22:51.605 --> 00:22:56.639
that they sent a television from America.

00:22:57.597 --> 00:23:00.952
Now America had nothing to do with Russia,

00:23:01.504 --> 00:23:04.422
but must be the Spirit of Shri Krishna

00:23:04.921 --> 00:23:12.580
trying to help the Spirit of right Agnya, must be.

00:23:13.713 --> 00:23:17.573
Such enthusiasm about Russia,

00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:21.924
it's unbelievable.

00:23:22.117 --> 00:23:26.686
They came in the buses, they came in the trains,
they went all the way

00:23:26.811 --> 00:23:30.053
to all these places, to far-fetched places,

00:23:33.756 --> 00:23:37.048
and they've achieved tremendous results.

00:23:38.908 --> 00:23:43.130
It's not only in Europe they're working it out

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:46.095
around their own cities,

00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:50.778
but all the way they are working in Turkey,

00:23:52.227 --> 00:23:58.342
they are working in Nepal, and now somebody has gone to Japan.

00:23:59.238 --> 00:24:02.923
He is actually not a Japanese,

00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:09.023
he is from Rio

00:24:11.081 --> 00:24:14.940
and he has gone to Japan, is a physicist,

00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:19.713
but he is using some sort of a pantomime show

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:25.067
on the streets to attract
the people and telling them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:29.864
He telephoned to Me three, four times,
“Mother, You have beento Australia so many times.

00:24:30.148 --> 00:24:32.291
Why don't You come to Japan this time?”

00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:36.027
I said, ”All right, next time I will definitely come to

00:24:36.151 --> 00:24:37.658
Japan,” I promised him,

00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:41.518
“but this time I'm already programmed you see, by Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:42.399 --> 00:24:47.093
so I can't help it. They have fixed Me up everywhere”;

00:24:47.645 --> 00:24:50.647
and I don't mind because it’s so Sahaj,

00:24:50.813 --> 00:24:52.552
to Me it comes Sahaj.

00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:55.887
Many people ask Me, “Mother, You are traveling so much,” they say.

00:24:56.034 --> 00:24:57.568
I never think about it.

00:25:01.126 --> 00:25:08.703
Also, the collectivity you have now is tremendous.

00:25:09.202 --> 00:25:12.736
It's not only in Australia you have the collectivity,

00:25:14.154 --> 00:25:19.389
but the other day I telephoned to someone in India and told them,

00:25:19.595 --> 00:25:21.803
“I'm buying an ashram in Brisbane.”

00:25:21.941 --> 00:25:25.307
They said, “ Mother it's a very great thing. We are very happy.”

00:25:25.475 --> 00:25:27.110
Now for an Indian,

00:25:28.221 --> 00:25:32.155
what is there to be happy if we buy an ashram in Brisbane?

00:25:34.677 --> 00:25:36.413
So overjoyed about it.

00:25:36.686 --> 00:25:40.812
To them Brisbane is the same as Bombay or Delhi.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.718
The Heart has become so large,

00:25:49.206 --> 00:25:52.619
because Shiva is shining there, the Spirit is shining.

00:25:52.812 --> 00:25:55.209
It has become such a large Heart

00:25:55.376 --> 00:26:00.547
that it encompasses the whole universe,
I think, the way people look at it,

00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:05.173
that's why you all have become universal people.

00:26:05.888 --> 00:26:12.094
You don't only read about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,

00:26:12.452 --> 00:26:17.261
you don't only knowabout it through your mind,

00:26:17.687 --> 00:26:22.754
you don't only try to follow it,
but you have imbibed it within yourself,

00:26:23.594 --> 00:26:26.927
which is so Sahaj, which you are not aware of it,

00:26:27.123 --> 00:26:30.252
how in a Sahaj way it has come to you.

00:26:31.462 --> 00:26:35.513
Now you know Australia was full of racialism once upon a time,

00:26:35.722 --> 00:26:39.159
nobody was come, allowed to come in here,

00:26:39.885 --> 00:26:44.794
might be fifty years back or so, but today in Australia

00:26:45.441 --> 00:26:47.067
what a change it is!

00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:52.518
Though they talked of Christianity and all those things, but

00:26:53.735 --> 00:26:56.695
they didn’t think what Christ has said,

00:26:57.217 --> 00:27:01.217
they were just the opposite of what Christianity should be.

00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:07.878
Islam is the same, Islam talks of very great things,

00:27:09.509 --> 00:27:15.274
but it has to be confessed that
the Muslims have nothing to do with Islam.

00:27:16.408 --> 00:27:20.135
Is absolutely from outside, if you see Christianity

00:27:22.085 --> 00:27:25.281
you have a very, very funny idea about it.

00:27:25.486 --> 00:27:29.468
If you ask any Hindu gentleman about Christianity

00:27:31.294 --> 00:27:34.560
they will say they are the worst possible people,

00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:42.281
very cunning, very aggressive
and it takes them no time to kill each other.

00:27:44.214 --> 00:27:52.217
Imagine, disciples of Christ;
but if you ask a Christian about a Muslim

00:27:52.478 --> 00:27:58.932
he will tell you, “Oh, these Muslims
are the most quarrelsome, dirtiest people ever born,

00:27:59.476 --> 00:28:02.538
fundamentalist.” They are all fundamentalist,

00:28:02.675 --> 00:28:08.142
whether it's a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anyone,
they're fundamentalist because

00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:10.621
they are reading one book

00:28:11.858 --> 00:28:13.964
and that too, just reading.

00:28:14.124 --> 00:28:17.322
The book also doesn't go, if the book goes inside

00:28:17.403 --> 00:28:19.836
they will realize that all these books

00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:24.061
are telling the same thing under different names, that's all.

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:27.257
But that universal thing you have got,

00:28:27.393 --> 00:28:31.484
thanks to your Spirit, that was there quite intact

00:28:31.665 --> 00:28:34.399
and which has started shining within you.

00:28:35.427 --> 00:28:40.381
So we have now a new community, a new civilization

00:28:40.563 --> 00:28:48.528
of people who are extremely honest with themselves,
honest to each other.

00:28:50.331 --> 00:28:53.793
They are extremely righteous and good people,

00:28:54.587 --> 00:28:57.229
they are absolutely non-violent,

00:28:57.703 --> 00:29:04.703
absolutely law-abiding, very loving, affectionate,

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.171
at the same time extremely constructive,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:16.819
and at the same time very intelligent.

00:29:18.701 --> 00:29:22.542
They understand Sahaja Yoga, it's such a subtle subject.

00:29:22.758 --> 00:29:25.291
Sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.389
because you know everybody has failed to make people understand

00:29:30.877 --> 00:29:32.538
anything about truth.

00:29:32.922 --> 00:29:39.379
It’s an impossible situation. But this was the trick, your Spirit.

00:29:40.808 --> 00:29:45.048
Once your Spirit is enlightened it goes into your head

00:29:47.482 --> 00:29:50.643
without any difficulties, absolutely Sahaj.

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:56.139
You don't know how difficult is this subject of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:01.116 --> 00:30:05.413
It is such a fulfillment

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.751
for the desire of the Divine

00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:16.581
that your  Divinity is now expressing itself.

00:30:18.554 --> 00:30:23.525
When you are collective, you are more enjoying each other,

00:30:23.809 --> 00:30:32.231
you enjoy collective life. Individualism is against

00:30:32.628 --> 00:30:34.738
the spirit of the whole,

00:30:38.923 --> 00:30:42.788
but we have our own varieties.

00:30:43.506 --> 00:30:48.697
The way you live in other countries, in other atmospheres,

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:54.014
with other traditions, that's how you are living.

00:30:58.518 --> 00:31:05.629
But among ourselves we have the same faith,

00:31:07.284 --> 00:31:11.373
the faith which is enlightened, which is not blind faith,

00:31:11.647 --> 00:31:17.032
enlightened faith, firstly that you are realized souls,

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:21.158
secondly that there is an all-pervading Power.

00:31:22.122 --> 00:31:27.719
We have the same type of worship, whether it is Christ,

00:31:27.912 --> 00:31:32.025
whether it is Mohammed Sahib or whether it is Shiva.

00:31:33.834 --> 00:31:38.824
We all worship it the same way, we do not have a sort of a

00:31:40.741 --> 00:31:42.807
difference of opinion on that,

00:31:44.924 --> 00:31:47.458
like one church becoming ten churches

00:31:48.592 --> 00:31:52.990
and one Hinduism becoming ten Hinduisms. It's not like that.

00:31:54.271 --> 00:32:00.854
We are all Sahaja Yogis and we have all got the same principle

00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:04.233
binding us in a Sahaj manner.

00:32:05.162 --> 00:32:09.048
We don't have to say, “Oh we have to be principled,

00:32:09.298 --> 00:32:12.965
we have to be on this principle, we are Sahaja Yogis.”

00:32:13.906 --> 00:32:19.179
You have to be there, absolutely, because you have to be there.

00:32:20.903 --> 00:32:22.805
You just can't help it,

00:32:23.599 --> 00:32:28.768
because in your nature now the Spirit is shining.

00:32:32.872 --> 00:32:36.569
Also, you are becoming archetypes,

00:32:36.694 --> 00:32:39.627
I should say, in the real sense of the word,

00:32:39.983 --> 00:32:43.169
for the people who are not in Sahaj.

00:32:45.721 --> 00:32:51.473
Such people are not available anywhere.

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:58.580
When people will see you they will think that what a model it is,
what a model of life.

00:32:58.796 --> 00:33:01.515
They don't drink, they don't smoke,

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.494
they don't boast of it, they don't hate anyone,

00:33:04.597 --> 00:33:10.231
they love anyone, they are so dynamic, they are so creative,

00:33:10.774 --> 00:33:16.052
they are so constructive, they are so self-contented.

00:33:17.469 --> 00:33:20.079
They are not at all competitive,

00:33:21.134 --> 00:33:26.825
they cause no problem to Nature, they cause no problem to anything.

00:33:30.878 --> 00:33:33.544
They have become such beautiful people.

00:33:33.882 --> 00:33:35.761
Who are these people?

00:33:36.766 --> 00:33:40.834
Such beautiful people are the models. So now,

00:33:41.118 --> 00:33:44.251
individually you have to understand this part,

00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:49.712
that we have to be models in this country of Australia.

00:33:51.113 --> 00:34:01.338
Model of good behavior, good language, decent life,

00:34:01.746 --> 00:34:06.562
decorous life, not fighting with husband,

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:09.535
fighting with wife, you see you open any television,

00:34:09.637 --> 00:34:11.769
just get a headache, I mean there's, there's no other

00:34:11.848 --> 00:34:16.637
thing but a husband fighting wife and a wife fighting husband.

00:34:18.736 --> 00:34:21.383
There should be wisdom about it.

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:27.361
Fighting among yourselves, you see if so many people have gather

00:34:27.608 --> 00:34:31.544
in a pub what will happen that pub will burst out.

00:34:33.993 --> 00:34:36.194
They can never sit silently.

00:34:38.779 --> 00:34:42.518
The mayor of Cabella told Me, “It surprises me

00:34:43.062 --> 00:34:47.409
that in the church we are sitting for half an hour then we start

00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:52.471
nudging each other. ‘How long
is it going to take now? Better get out.’

00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:58.031
You get tired; and what are
these people doing for hours together with You?

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:02.383
How are they so spellbound? They don't feel tired.

00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:09.282
I think they are special people.” I said, “They are, they are.”

00:35:12.797 --> 00:35:16.604
“But what do they do?” “They don't do anything,

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:22.482
they are just enjoying.” He couldn't understand that

00:35:22.642 --> 00:35:27.171
once we had a Puja, Guru Puja, for about six hours altogether,

00:35:27.377 --> 00:35:31.083
and they were surprised that how these people are sitting;

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:36.329
and all the people they were,
all the villagers, mostly they are elderly,

00:35:36.543 --> 00:35:40.133
they thought that these angels have come from somewhere,

00:35:40.292 --> 00:35:43.625
they are angelic people: they don't trouble you,

00:35:43.824 --> 00:35:46.928
they don't torture you, they look after you,

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:53.923
they try to be kind to you, not only that but they try to

00:35:54.615 --> 00:36:03.019
bring joy to you. They were so surprised in that village.

00:36:03.896 --> 00:36:06.653
First they used to call Me “Princess”.

00:36:06.788 --> 00:36:09.434
Then they started calling Me “Goddess”,

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:11.316
then they said,” You are Madonna.”

00:36:11.433 --> 00:36:15.274
Whatever they could think of the best, they started

00:36:15.853 --> 00:36:22.017
saying all those things. They want now to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:27.890
but I said, “Let us see now.”
After some time, we'll work it out for them also.

00:36:29.943 --> 00:36:32.437
They are so nice now by seeing

00:36:32.665 --> 00:36:36.065
how the Sahaja Yogis are, because I seldom go out;

00:36:36.247 --> 00:36:39.004
but seeing the way Sahaja Yogis are,

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:42.314
that the land behind the house

00:36:42.643 --> 00:36:46.612
was not even given to Prince Dorio
who was willing to pay lot of money,

00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:49.099
because he wanted to have a road that way;

00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:52.775
but to Me they rushed forward

00:36:54.577 --> 00:36:58.554
and at a very nominal price they gave Me that land.

00:36:58.682 --> 00:37:02.001
They said, “It is for You only, please have it.”

00:37:03.578 --> 00:37:07.201
The whole village is getting into transformation.

00:37:11.317 --> 00:37:15.364
But the dedication you have is very remarkable,

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.829
surprises Me, really surprises Me.

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:23.750
I have never taught you much,

00:37:24.737 --> 00:37:27.737
but the way you are dedicated in everything!

00:37:32.106 --> 00:37:36.809
Everyone who is not a Sahaja Yogi

00:37:37.648 --> 00:37:45.238
will be charmed the way you are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga, to Me.

00:37:46.507 --> 00:37:51.015
Sometimes I think, “What have I done? I have done nothing.”

00:37:51.344 --> 00:37:56.355
You had your Kundalini, you had your Spirit, that's all,

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:05.674
but such a difference, with little distance you covered,

00:38:06.286 --> 00:38:08.327
and such a difference!

00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:13.467
Can you imagine an Indian woman coming to Australia,

00:38:14.023 --> 00:38:19.664
finding this love, this affection and this dedication?
Unbelievable!

00:38:24.143 --> 00:38:27.598
They all think that I must be mesmerizing you.

00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:31.877
Nobody can believe that you could be that dedicated,

00:38:32.013 --> 00:38:34.709
take so much trouble, so much care;

00:38:34.925 --> 00:38:37.666
I mean just imagine the flowers that you have brought,

00:38:37.785 --> 00:38:39.911
just imagine all this you have done,

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.584
I mean just imagine the way they brought another

00:38:42.675 --> 00:38:47.085
big car so that your Mother should be
brought here without any difficulty.

00:38:47.222 --> 00:38:48.457
All this love,

00:38:50.487 --> 00:38:56.403
all this affection, this care, I never asked for anything.

00:38:56.686 --> 00:38:58.542
I could have walked down,

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:02.465
if you had said we have to walk,
I would have walked, I would never have said no.

00:39:02.602 --> 00:39:05.057
I never expected all this thing.

00:39:06.044 --> 00:39:09.615
But the way you want to express your love to Me,

00:39:09.718 --> 00:39:16.951
this dedication is so much and you sacrifice so much for that.

00:39:18.029 --> 00:39:20.891
Really you are sacrificing quite a lot,

00:39:23.635 --> 00:39:30.630
your time, your effort, to come
all the way to this far-off place for this Puja.

00:39:33.316 --> 00:39:37.203
All the gain that you have from Puja is only possible

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:41.964
when you are a realized soul, otherwise it is useless

00:39:42.963 --> 00:39:47.577
to do any Puja, any worship. People go to church,

00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:50.564
sing few hymns and come back.

00:39:50.655 --> 00:39:54.189
They are just the same and afterwards go to the pub,

00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:59.322
because they think pub is the only place
where they can get some joy.

00:39:59.999 --> 00:40:04.968
One has to exert, one has to sacrifice,

00:40:05.273 --> 00:40:07.776
though I may say that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest thing.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.848
You don't have to go to
Himalayas to stand on your heads and all that,

00:40:11.939 --> 00:40:18.141
but still you have to sacrifice your time, your attention.

00:40:19.268 --> 00:40:24.221
Formerly you might be going to some rock music,

00:40:25.502 --> 00:40:28.600
you might be going to some pubs also,

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.339
you might be enjoying all these things;
but you have given up everything,

00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:35.344
without My telling you, just have given up

00:40:35.425 --> 00:40:37.494
and you are so pure now.

00:40:38.265 --> 00:40:42.265
Your attention is so pure you can't enjoy all these things.

00:40:43.843 --> 00:40:47.910
Don't you think it's very remarkable that this has happened?

00:40:49.085 --> 00:40:52.679
This community, I don't have to tell you,

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:57.416
I don't have to educate, I must say

00:40:57.575 --> 00:41:00.308
that all these things you have given up.

00:41:00.806 --> 00:41:05.203
Suddenly I find all of you have become so clean,

00:41:05.465 --> 00:41:08.344
so beautiful, your chakras so clean.

00:41:10.952 --> 00:41:16.917
Is it that these are your purva punyas that is working out?

00:41:18.573 --> 00:41:22.424
But still I would say you must know your self-esteem,

00:41:22.527 --> 00:41:26.527
that you are Sahaja Yogis, and how can you behave like this

00:41:26.631 --> 00:41:31.901
if you are a Sahaja Yogi? You cannot. Now you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:37.309
so that dignity, that wisdom has to be there;

00:41:39.662 --> 00:41:45.782
the compassion, the love, the unity of purpose should be there.

00:41:47.516 --> 00:41:51.012
All over the world you have brothers and sisters,

00:41:51.128 --> 00:41:55.674
this brotherhood and sisterhood is everywhere.

00:41:55.924 --> 00:42:00.263
You have rakhi sisters, you have very pure relationships.

00:42:01.182 --> 00:42:05.104
Anything impure is just thrown out in a Sahaj manner.

00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:09.797
Those who do not fit into it just get out of it.

00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:18.672
We have now very beautiful families, very beautiful children,

00:42:19.636 --> 00:42:26.104
it's, just think of it.
Moses saved some Jews but what are they good for, nothing,

00:42:27.817 --> 00:42:30.933
what's the use of saving such people?

00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:37.486
Then Christ came and talked about this thing,

00:42:37.842 --> 00:42:43.093
and this is what has happened to Christianity.

00:42:43.774 --> 00:42:48.258
Mohammed came and talked of very nice things, I must tell you.

00:42:48.386 --> 00:42:51.388
He never made it a rigid religion, never.

00:42:51.605 --> 00:42:55.436
It was very flexible, and He said, “You must get the knowledge.”

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.325
So according to them, knowledge was to read the book

00:42:58.442 --> 00:43:01.716
and to interpret it and to be an intellectual.

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:09.832
After that came Guru Nanaka also, you know that.

00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:13.286
What has happened to Sikhs, where they have gone?

00:43:13.411 --> 00:43:16.078
“Sikh” means the person who has learnt,

00:43:16.477 --> 00:43:18.606
learnt the Divine laws.

00:43:19.695 --> 00:43:24.085
If I say you have to follow the Divine laws, how?
You are not connected,

00:43:24.334 --> 00:43:27.089
you don't know what are the Divine laws are.

00:43:27.214 --> 00:43:30.281
Just follow: “We want to follow Divine laws.”

00:43:30.865 --> 00:43:33.799
Now you are hanging somewhere on this earth,

00:43:33.953 --> 00:43:36.496
the Divine laws are working there,

00:43:36.644 --> 00:43:39.079
how are you going to work out the Divine laws

00:43:39.175 --> 00:43:40.908
if you are not connected?

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:44.785
But you know immediately what are the Divine laws;

00:43:44.924 --> 00:43:47.794
you are going against it, as soon as you go against it

00:43:47.885 --> 00:43:51.685
you know you can feel it on your central nervous system.

00:43:51.864 --> 00:43:57.871
You can feel it on your hands,
that you are doing something against the Divine laws.

00:43:58.834 --> 00:44:02.029
Immediately you know and if you are alert

00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:06.089
you'll immediately try to change. You'll think,

00:44:07.087 --> 00:44:12.694
“That's not correct, this is the truth about myself.”

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.367
You start judging yourself all the time

00:44:15.482 --> 00:44:20.957
and you want to put yourself right
because you don't like it that way.

00:44:22.545 --> 00:44:27.020
So many ideas you have about your personal life

00:44:27.836 --> 00:44:30.373
are that, you see, there should be

00:44:30.482 --> 00:44:35.048
“a wife who should spoil me” or “a husband who should spoil me”,

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.873
“My child should be like this”, and - all finished now.

00:44:39.561 --> 00:44:43.256
What do you want? “I want a real Sahaja Yogini”,

00:44:43.936 --> 00:44:46.658
“I want a real Sahaja Yogi to marry”,

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:49.984
and after that the marriage becomes a blessing.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:55.638
How? How these flowers have come out, that's how.

00:44:57.385 --> 00:45:00.965
It's all innately built within you, all this beauty.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:08.148
You just start showing, but it has to sprout, it has to come up.

00:45:15.258 --> 00:45:20.854
This penance, so-called, is no penance to you.

00:45:21.012 --> 00:45:24.459
They say “We are enjoying this place”, I mean it's a

00:45:24.562 --> 00:45:28.471
place for penance only, the way things are here,

00:45:29.832 --> 00:45:33.097
there are not even closed bathrooms.

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:37.664
People are finding it rather difficult to take a bath even.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:44.846
It's quite a penance to come to such a far-fetched place,

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:49.016
or to travel in Maharashtra is another big penance.

00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:54.320
But you enjoy it, I mean you were missing; they said,
“We are missing our buses.” I said, “Really?

00:45:56.834 --> 00:46:02.344
I thought you would be happy. “No, no, Mother we are missing.”
I mean it was an adventure for them,

00:46:02.585 --> 00:46:09.045
they liked the way they were jostled and they were given hiccups,

00:46:09.204 --> 00:46:10.980
they’re very happy about it,

00:46:11.083 --> 00:46:14.459
that all this was, this was like an adventure.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.543
Everything which we call as tapasya

00:46:17.997 --> 00:46:21.316
or as the penance becomes an adventure for them,

00:46:21.419 --> 00:46:24.552
and the way they describe is very interesting.

00:46:24.922 --> 00:46:28.264
Like these musicians, they went to Russia and got lost,

00:46:28.389 --> 00:46:34.456
and when they came back, and they were describing the
whole thing with such description,

00:46:35.101 --> 00:46:38.931
as if God was just taking them from places to places.

00:46:39.782 --> 00:46:44.099
And how they were helped every moment, how they came

00:46:44.315 --> 00:46:49.042
to Italy sudden and how they came to Milan, to the ashram.

00:46:49.247 --> 00:46:52.328
The whole description is tremendous.

00:46:54.947 --> 00:47:01.685
Now think of what you have achieved, but you can't even think,

00:47:02.445 --> 00:47:03.927
you just achieve.

00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:13.146
Without thinking you achieve things,
is the blessing of your Spirit, blessing of Shiva.

00:47:14.269 --> 00:47:19.426
The Spirit is the witness and you develop that witness state.

00:47:20.447 --> 00:47:24.594
To you all this looks like a funny stage

00:47:24.697 --> 00:47:27.621
where people are doing this and that, politics, economics,

00:47:27.747 --> 00:47:30.137
you see as something absurd.

00:47:31.192 --> 00:47:34.658
I went down to Russia, there were so many Russians.

00:47:35.024 --> 00:47:39.734
I told them that there's a very bad shape the politics is here now

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:42.600
and you are having very bad times with your food.

00:47:42.722 --> 00:47:46.296
“No, Mother, we have no problem with food or anything,

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.261
but what do we care? We have got the spiritual food,

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:54.703
let these people fight, do whatever, we are not bothered.”

00:47:56.495 --> 00:48:01.428
They were least bothered as there was a coup or anything,
least bothered.

00:48:02.301 --> 00:48:05.120
“Let them fight, let them do what they like,

00:48:05.289 --> 00:48:09.206
we are in a different situation.”

00:48:09.399 --> 00:48:13.418
I said, “Which situation you are?” “We are in the Kingdom of God,”

00:48:13.532 --> 00:48:14.753
they told Me,

00:48:15.082 --> 00:48:21.883
“We are in the Kingdom of God, why should we worry
about these kingdoms and things, let them fight.”

00:48:22.044 --> 00:48:26.406
Such contented people, so very beautiful.

00:48:26.562 --> 00:48:29.765
You have so many brothers and sisters there.

00:48:29.879 --> 00:48:33.790
Early in the morning I got up and they had, I don't know when,

00:48:33.882 --> 00:48:39.523
planted flowers on the road of My house there,

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.591
flowers all along, rows after rows.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:49.646
I don't know when they came, when they did it and disappeared.

00:48:49.953 --> 00:48:53.975
So sweet, I tell you, except for

00:48:55.325 --> 00:48:59.032
crying with joy  I didn't know what to say.

00:48:59.753 --> 00:49:01.592
If this happens all over,

00:49:02.002 --> 00:49:04.326
what a world we can have.

00:49:04.802 --> 00:49:09.167
There are of course some people who are exceptional,
who are troublesome,

00:49:09.304 --> 00:49:15.651
who are not all right; it's all right, forget about them.

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:30.315
So now, you are the people who have understood what is God,

00:49:31.801 --> 00:49:38.158
what is Sadashiva. Now you have faith in Him which is not blind,

00:49:38.533 --> 00:49:41.388
you also know that His powers work,

00:49:41.717 --> 00:49:46.317
that His laws work, all other laws are useless,
only His laws works.

00:49:50.913 --> 00:49:54.277
You have seen, experienced in your lifetime

00:49:54.629 --> 00:49:58.901
how miracles are taking place, how things are working out.

00:49:59.049 --> 00:50:02.280
A simple miracle I would say, it was desired

00:50:02.428 --> 00:50:06.158
that Shiva Puja should be around some hills,

00:50:06.759 --> 00:50:08.887
but they couldn't arrange,

00:50:09.024 --> 00:50:14.510
they were trying for some other place
which could not be arranged, so you are here.

00:50:14.726 --> 00:50:20.440
You desire and it works, as if your desire acts.

00:50:23.002 --> 00:50:26.741
But we have some people who are still mediocre,

00:50:26.911 --> 00:50:29.660
who are behaving in a mediocre manner,

00:50:29.773 --> 00:50:32.839
very dull, some of them are very dull people.

00:50:33.209 --> 00:50:35.209
They cannot understand Sahaj,

00:50:35.402 --> 00:50:39.493
they don't understand how much they can gain out of it.

00:50:39.777 --> 00:50:43.005
So you shouldn't worry about them.

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:48.856
Then you have to think about the whole collective which is good

00:50:49.117 --> 00:50:52.450
and one or two useless people, forget about them.

00:50:52.936 --> 00:50:55.881
If they come up well and good, if they don't come up,

00:50:56.006 --> 00:50:58.489
we are not going to force them.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.816
We'll be getting more and more people, more and more people.

00:51:04.905 --> 00:51:07.749
I'm sure it will happen.

00:51:08.746 --> 00:51:13.013
But the greatest thing you have got is the complete integration

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:21.625
within your being: your heart, your mind,

00:51:24.029 --> 00:51:29.321
your liver I should say, your attention, are all integrated.

00:51:30.444 --> 00:51:33.431
There's no quarrel, there's no struggle

00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:40.789
between your heart and your mind, heart and your brain.

00:51:41.572 --> 00:51:46.514
Whatever your brain thinks, your heart accepts,

00:51:46.797 --> 00:51:50.963
whatever your heart wants, your brain accepts,

00:51:51.156 --> 00:51:56.825
whatever your attention is there, is completely integrated

00:51:57.571 --> 00:52:01.290
with your heart and with your brain.

00:52:03.014 --> 00:52:07.214
You must see the other people, they don't want to do something

00:52:07.979 --> 00:52:11.502
but they have to do it because they’re habituated.

00:52:11.663 --> 00:52:15.243
So many people told Me: “We want to give up this, we can't.”

00:52:15.368 --> 00:52:19.106
Once you have got the Spirit, you get that power

00:52:19.912 --> 00:52:23.045
that you can surpass all the said temptations,

00:52:23.166 --> 00:52:26.871
not only temptations, also the differentiations

00:52:27.042 --> 00:52:29.964
that you always make: “This is that, this is that.”

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:35.758
But you integrate, you integrate among yourselves,

00:52:36.439 --> 00:52:39.248
you integrate among different states,

00:52:39.373 --> 00:52:42.409
you integrate among different countries.

00:52:44.167 --> 00:52:48.812
The whole cosmos seems to be integrated, woven

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:55.323
and governed by the Divine laws.

00:52:57.908 --> 00:53:05.017
This integration gives you a complete understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:16.125
mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

00:53:20.602 --> 00:53:25.534
It’s not by some sort of a brain-washing

00:53:26.124 --> 00:53:32.527
or bombarding, but just through the light of Spirit
you have seen the truth

00:53:33.627 --> 00:53:38.579
and you have understood it. Also you have so many powers.

00:53:39.713 --> 00:53:43.913
You do not want to exert, that's a different point altogether,

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.880
but just try.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:53.225
One word of prayer from you is very powerful

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:57.137
than hundreds of prayers of these people.

00:54:00.845 --> 00:54:05.606
One asking is much more powerful

00:54:06.567 --> 00:54:09.138
than thousands of these askings.

00:54:09.513 --> 00:54:12.323
You have never tried that; try that,

00:54:12.856 --> 00:54:16.789
you are extremely powerful, whatever you desire works out.

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:23.647
You have other powers of giving Realization,

00:54:23.965 --> 00:54:26.432
also curing, you have so many powers

00:54:27.027 --> 00:54:30.660
but most of the time you'll bring somebody to Me to be cured.

00:54:30.865 --> 00:54:33.472
No, no, there's no need.

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:37.923
You have given all powers; you have all the powers, use them.

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:43.278
Don't be afraid, use these powers, and you will be amazed

00:54:43.834 --> 00:54:46.151
how these power work out,

00:54:47.648 --> 00:54:57.471
and how you become more and more embedded in your faith,
in yourself.

00:55:00.407 --> 00:55:02.978
Of course there are Sahaja Yogis

00:55:03.296 --> 00:55:06.947
who are made to sit on the throne but still they are begging,

00:55:07.038 --> 00:55:09.243
what can you do about it?

00:55:11.783 --> 00:55:16.805
You are so very powerful in collective and also individually.

00:55:19.244 --> 00:55:22.099
Whatever you want, you can have it.

00:55:23.018 --> 00:55:26.458
I am desireless because the Divine,

00:55:27.643 --> 00:55:33.772
the Divine power is working for Me, everything
- I don't have to desire - it knows.

00:55:35.076 --> 00:55:38.343
I don't desire anything, but you have to desire,

00:55:40.104 --> 00:55:43.756
you have to pray, you have to ask.

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:47.916
And the wider you become your prayers will be wider,

00:55:48.064 --> 00:55:50.943
for a wider world, wider vision,

00:55:51.374 --> 00:55:54.710
not limited to your children, not limited to your family,

00:55:54.801 --> 00:56:00.651
not limited to one place, but unlimited areas you'll cover.

00:56:06.824 --> 00:56:11.518
So we become very conscious and alert

00:56:12.063 --> 00:56:16.981
about whatever is happening in the world
to put our attention there.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:21.559
We try to find out what's wrong with this
and what's wrong with that.

00:56:21.696 --> 00:56:24.709
We are not just worried about a small little ashram,

00:56:24.811 --> 00:56:29.051
but we are worried about the whole world to find out what's wrong,

00:56:29.242 --> 00:56:31.235
what can we do, what can we desire,

00:56:31.315 --> 00:56:37.584
because if we have the power,
and if we can operate the Divine power,

00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:42.378
then why not we work it out ourselves? We can.

00:56:42.696 --> 00:56:45.470
So your attention can go to any place.

00:56:45.551 --> 00:56:47.421
It can go to Nicaragua,

00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:57.374
it can go to Israel, it can go to Saddam Hussein,
to any place that you want to work it out.

00:56:57.884 --> 00:57:00.561
It moves, it's mobile, it's universal.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:08.833
Just start expanding your heart, your mind and your attention.

00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:21.401
Your faith in Me, I must say, is great.
I am Myself surprised at that.

00:57:29.091 --> 00:57:31.106
I am quite a camouflage.

00:57:32.354 --> 00:57:36.287
It's not easy to understand Me, I don't understand Myself!

00:57:43.701 --> 00:57:48.080
On one side of course I'm Divine, no doubt,

00:57:49.815 --> 00:57:52.862
on the other side, I am very human.

00:57:54.019 --> 00:57:59.867
Even in a film, if I see somebody suffering,
I start crying, can't bear.

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:04.778
I can't cure children because I can't see their sufferings.

00:58:04.971 --> 00:58:10.531
It's another aspect of Mine. I’ve made Myself extremely human,

00:58:14.874 --> 00:58:21.134
and this Divinity of Mine also is just Sahaj.

00:58:22.574 --> 00:58:24.106
I've done nothing,

00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:29.288
I've been like this and I'm like this, I've not achieved anything.

00:58:29.583 --> 00:58:33.650
If I've achieved anything, is understanding of human beings,

00:58:34.402 --> 00:58:38.050
because I always felt that all these Incarnations

00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:43.444
and all these prophets never understood human beings.

00:58:43.615 --> 00:58:47.229
They never knew that they are not enlightened people

00:58:47.331 --> 00:58:51.549
and no use talking to them of these great things, it’s all a waste.

00:58:51.663 --> 00:58:53.429
It's like a blind person,

00:58:53.826 --> 00:58:58.026
you explain to him all the colors and the beauty of the stage.

00:59:02.477 --> 00:59:14.157
And so this human realization,
I should, that I had, is so beautiful.

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.315
Now I understand what is the joy of bhakti,

00:59:21.337 --> 00:59:24.701
what is the joy of gnyana,

00:59:26.198 --> 00:59:32.842
what is the joy of karma, because a person
who doesn't do anything,

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:43.303
a person who has no bhakti and who has no gnyana

00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:50.644
is just wakened completely.

00:59:53.026 --> 00:59:55.998
I had to fill in Myself with all these things

00:59:56.123 --> 00:59:58.730
that I have to know the gnyana,

00:59:58.867 --> 01:00:02.594
not the gnyana of the Divine because after all that is,

01:00:02.731 --> 01:00:08.546
that is not difficult, because if I am that, I know that,

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.010
but the gnyana of the human beings,

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:19.380
the problems of the human beings, I had to study for years

01:00:20.038 --> 01:00:24.967
the human beings to work it out.

01:00:26.509 --> 01:00:28.763
But once it has worked,

01:00:30.804 --> 01:00:36.204
that's what is said that there is Divinity in
you has started expressing itself,

01:00:37.391 --> 01:00:41.527
and such beautiful Divine lights are sitting before Me.

01:00:42.922 --> 01:00:48.940
I bless you all from My heart where resides the Shiva,
the Sadashiva,

01:00:49.836 --> 01:00:51.965
and Sadashiva blesses you.

01:00:52.509 --> 01:00:56.883
He is a innocent personality, absolutely innocent.

01:00:57.473 --> 01:01:04.176
He is the One who is beyond any attachments,

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:10.523
absolutely beyond any attachments.

01:01:12.004 --> 01:01:19.758
He is the One who is watching,
watching all of you with such admiration,

01:01:20.949 --> 01:01:30.389
His joy knows no bounds, it's tremendous,
as if He is dancing with joy.

01:01:32.782 --> 01:01:39.777
It's a great day for us to celebrate this Shiva Puja here.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:44.560
I hope all of you respect the principle of Shiva within you,

01:01:44.673 --> 01:01:46.844
that's the most important.

01:01:47.128 --> 01:01:55.132
And look after your vibrations, which pulsates in your being,

01:01:55.450 --> 01:02:00.463
because the Spirit has awakened in your attention,

01:02:00.815 --> 01:02:03.760
in your central nervous system.

01:02:03.942 --> 01:02:07.142
That's the most important thing you have to do.

01:02:07.242 --> 01:02:10.778
The rest of it is Sahaj.

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.519
The rest of it is absolutely Sahaj.

01:02:15.937 --> 01:02:18.037
May God bless you all.
