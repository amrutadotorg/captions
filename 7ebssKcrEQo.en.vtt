00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:12.169
Now I'm told that it is very
difficult even to wake up in England.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.189
Somebody had told me, when I was young,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.405
that don't wake up an Englishman.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.917
I haven't tried that, even with a barge pole.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:27.881
I just tell you at this time, never in the morning time.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.856
Because I've been warned: never wake up an Englishman,

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:33.974
that is the greatest sin on this earth!

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.064
So why should the English be so much addicted to sleep!

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.481
The whole country is sleeping today.

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:52.902
They want more wages, more
wages so that they can sleep more.

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:57.312
Eat and drink, drink and eat in between, sleep.

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:02.767
This is the three - programmed life.

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:09.081
It was very difficult, from the very beginnig

00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:14.397
I saw Sahaja Yogis coming, in
that to wake them up was difficult.

00:01:14.477 --> 00:01:20.042
And these are the same people who were known for punctuality

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:26.036
that they won the war at Waterloo because of punctuality,

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:30.893
and they were so punctual that
people used to set their watches --

00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:34.397
even in America. They are the same people.

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:38.451
Now the other side of it is
that they sleep like log of wood.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:45.008
They used to sleep before also must be, because
this is an old saying that. Don't wake up an Englishman.

00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:49.349
But I used to think something else about it why it is said,

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.179
but it is nothing but simple laziness.

00:01:53.443 --> 00:02:00.360
So try to see why we sleep so much.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.598
If the left side is strong, people sleep.

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:13.397
If the back Agnya is strong, people sleep.

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:19.811
If the front Agnya is working too much

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:23.961
then people don't sleep.

00:02:25.352 --> 00:02:28.606
So even if I say, "Don't sleep",

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:34.038
it mean that you put your right Agnya in working condition,

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:38.939
that means you start thinking.
Which is against Sahaja Yoga again.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.270
So it would be left agnya, right agnya, 
right agnya, left agnya, right agnya, left agnya...

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.225
It will be going from one to another.

00:02:47.842 --> 00:02:56.717
So in the centre you have to be with Christ.

00:03:00.508 --> 00:03:06.421
He is alert every second of the day;

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:15.397
killing; beating, hitting,

00:03:15.477 --> 00:03:22.522
curing, looking after, guiding.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:27.348
Twenty four hours a day.

00:03:27.428 --> 00:03:31.598
And go and ask any realized soul

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.781
who is called as Avadhuta, the one who is a master,

00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:39.799
they will tell you they hardly
sleep for three hours or four hours.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.229
Because they cannot work when they are sleeping,

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.008
so they sleep for four hours,
the rest of the time they are working:

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:52.725
either they meditate and do things by projection,

00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:56.405
or they work with their hands.

00:03:56.485 --> 00:04:02.253
They are busy people, they are very busy.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:07.634
You have to be very busy people
because now you are employed by God.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:13.385
And you have to do full justice to
this employment by working hard.

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:21.672
On the contrary you have seen
that it is very easy to get lazy.

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:30.731
So now, as many of you are
already feeling sleepy, put your....

00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:34.027
First thing should be for all those people who are lazy,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:40.736
is to put their right to the left seven times.
Let's have it.

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:45.174
With the right hand....

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:04.382
It's better? Now the back Agnya.

00:05:04.462 --> 00:05:06.810
Let's have it.

00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:12.372
Laziness is first.

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:19.768
Shri Krishna was against laziness. Anywhere
he got a chance he talked against laziness,

00:05:19.848 --> 00:05:21.574
Alasya.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.802
Now watch me.

00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:30.344
On the photograph you can do the same....

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.480
Better now?

00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:36.773
Tonight we have to keep awake; it's a big problem.

00:06:36.853 --> 00:06:39.814
But don't sleep formally here. Alright ?

00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:42.632
Informally you can.

00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:58.450
Better ?

00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:04.048
Put your eyes, try.

00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:19.697
Again.

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:41.731
So the mastery should be, first of all, of your body.

00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.606
Say, you are sleeping on one side, you get a pain --

00:07:44.686 --> 00:07:49.282
then what do you do? You sleep on the other side.

00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:56.439
In the same way, this body is to
be made immune to different shocks,

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:59.981
you see. Like you put the watch in the water.

00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:04.728
You shock it with the water, so it is waterproof.

00:08:04.808 --> 00:08:09.540
So a Sahaja Yogi has to be an all-proofed person.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:18.522
So he has no place to complain,

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:21.353
because he's supposed to be all-proof, you see.

00:08:21.433 --> 00:08:24.689
Anybody (Sahaja Yogi) who complains, you can say,

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:29.920
"How are you complaining?
Because you have to be all-proof."

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.063
So no complaints of any kind, of Sahaja Yogis

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:42.716
are to be accepted or sympathized.
