00:14.517 --> 00:20.066
In these 108 names, if you have noticed,

00:20.267 --> 00:26.191
they have shown that Kartikeya is
the innocence

00:26.392 --> 00:31.565
that is acting on the right-hand side,
in the Pingala.

00:31.766 --> 00:38.593
And that is also – it is very much related
to Prana, it gives you Prana.

00:38.794 --> 00:45.762
Prana is the vital breath that we take –
breathe in and breathe out.

00:45.963 --> 00:52.650
So it is related to the right side. Then
also it is related to eternity, Anantaye.

00:52.851 --> 01:01.569
Ananta is the snake - the Shesha -
which is the brother of Vishnu.

01:01.770 --> 01:07.069
So it is He who is represented here
as Kartikeya.

01:07.270 --> 01:12.549
He is called as Ananta. So he is the fire.

01:12.750 --> 01:21.504
He is the one who ignites within you
the capacity to consume the force,

01:21.705 --> 01:27.764
also the capacity to command the people

01:27.965 --> 01:36.949
and also the capacity to be a person
full of brilliance.

01:37.150 --> 01:41.406
You see, an innocent person could be
very brilliant.

01:41.607 --> 01:49.974
All these capacities are expressed
in Kartikeya’s Swarupa, in His state.

01:50.188 --> 01:54.253
Today, by worshipping Kartikeya we have
to know

01:54.454 --> 01:59.289
that Kartikeya is now awakened within us.

01:59.490 --> 02:04.743
And with that capacity we have to fight.

02:04.944 --> 02:09.090
Ultimately, He is the Nishkalanka. He is
the one who is the final.

02:09.291 --> 02:13.679
So from Ganesha to Christ to Nishkalanka:

02:13.880 --> 02:18.847
these are the three stages into which
the innocence has gone.

02:19.048 --> 02:28.053
From Ganesha to Kartikeya and now
to Christ.

02:28.254 --> 02:31.476
And from Christ to Nishkalanka.

02:31.677 --> 02:34.546
In the form of Nishkalanka He is innocent,

02:34.760 --> 02:37.945
so there is no Kalanka, there is no spot
on Him, nothing.

02:38.146 --> 02:43.940
He is absolutely clean, immaculate;
plus, He is fiery.

02:44.141 --> 02:47.573
Plus, He has all the qualities of Ekadasha
Rudra,

02:47.774 --> 02:54.078
means the eleven qualities or the forces
of Shiva, which can kill.

02:54.279 --> 03:00.458
So He has a capacity to kill and destroy
that is evil

03:00.659 --> 03:08.222
and to give blessings and courage to His
followers.

03:08.729 --> 03:12.059
This is the last incarnation, which is
called as Kalki.

03:12.277 --> 03:14.161
In normal words you call it Kalki,

03:14.362 --> 03:18.100
is actually Nishkalanka, in the white
horse.

03:18.225 --> 03:23.927
So, it is the Kartikeya who sits
on the white horse.

03:24.128 --> 03:31.225
So how innocence grows within you now
is up to the point of Kartikeya.

03:31.426 --> 03:37.290
This has been today done on this land,
Deutschland as you call it,

03:37.491 --> 03:41.833
where Kartikeya is to be born within you,
is to be awakened in you.

03:42.033 --> 03:43.920
May God bless you.
