00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:06.847
TV Reporter: Thank you! That will be very
relaxing, wouldn't it? Which leads me

00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:10.537
into our next segment probably comes, is
no surprise to learn that nine out of ten

00:00:10.537 --> 00:00:14.273
Aussies are are a little stressed out at
work. Work as it is the main cause,

00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:19.631
well, a lifeline study is found, the worst
job for stress is driving public transport

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:24.939
Police, ambulance officers and welfare
workers are far behind. It's not good news

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:32.091
from police or employers. Workplace stress
costs 15 billion dollars every year in
lost productivity

00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:36.740
but according to research by Sydney Uni;
Meditation could be the answer!

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.407
We'll talk to Ramesh Manocha, has more.
Good morning! Nice to see you.
Dr. Ramesh Manocha: Good morning! 
Likewise.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:44.927
TV Reporter: I'm sorry. Meditation being
the answer, obviously, obviously it works

00:00:44.927 --> 00:00:48.352
if it's found out but what's your view on it, had it?
- Dr. Ramesh Manocha: Oh, we've conducted

00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:52.734
probably, one of the most thoroughly designed
scientific studies ever done on meditation

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:58.433
and found that just 6-8 weeks of a technique
called Sahaja yoga, is able to bring about

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:04.693
substantial reductions is stress and improvements
in moods just with 10, maybe 20 minutes a day

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:07.548
and costs nothing to learn
- is highly effective.

00:01:07.548 --> 00:01:10.297
TV Reporter: So, is it something easy 
and accessible, because if you're talking

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:15.278
some of these workers, who are very
stressed and very busy are kind of who

00:01:15.278 --> 00:01:18.886
may not the ones that are going to pack up
and go to yoga class and take an hour or

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:21.245
half out of their day, are they? 
Or they can do at work?

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:24.965
Dr. Manocha: Very true! We've tested it
out in the work place and also after work

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:29.752
on Australian workers with very substantial effects.
- TV Reporter: Can you tell us how you do it?

00:01:29.752 --> 00:01:32.123
I've never meditated. Is it difficult?
- Dr. Manocha: It's very easy. We can go

00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:34.148
through it now in just 90 seconds.
- TV Reporter: Sure!

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:38.742
Dr. Manocha: So, we sit quietly with our
hands on our lap, palm up and just

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:42.583
understanding that there's an energy of
meditation within us but we don't have to

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:47.509
do any meditation effort, we just have to
allow the experience to occur. We put our

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.409
right hand on our tummy on the left side,
just below the ribs and here we direct these

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.949
affirmations to that energy. We
just say here, a few times,

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.239
"I am my own master," or
"I am my own teacher."

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:05.324
Then we move our hand up to our heart. We
just say here a few times, "I am the Spirit,"

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:09.521
and then we take our hand up to where the
left shoulder meets the neck and here,

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:15.251
we just relieve that tension by saying,
"I am not guilty," and then we take the

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:19.316
right hand right across the forehead,
grasping the temples and we relieve the

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:25.511
tension here by saying, "I forgive everyone
and everything." Then finally, center of the

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:31.437
palm on that fontanel area, which is a soft
spot on the top of the head, just focusing

00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:35.636
our attention jetly on the top of the head
here and we ask that energy of meditation

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:39.840
within us, "Please give me the experience
of mental stillness or mental silence,"

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:45.136
and then, we raise our right hand up 5 or
6 cms, allow our attention to gently flow up

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:50.946
into that cool, calm, silent space above the head
and here we just sit quietly for a little while,

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:55.358
enjoy the silence of the present moment
for a little while and you can follow that

00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:59.442
up and learn all of that, free of charge
on freemeditation.com.au.

00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:02.255
TV Reporter: Do you have, is it something that
comes naturally or do you have to practice,

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:05.468
I was just saying, it takes time?
Dr. Manocha: It's very natural, it's very easy.
TV Reporter: Unnh!

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:09.001
Dr. Manocha: In fact, we've taught 5 year old children, we've taught 65 year old grandmothers

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.514
It's very simple to learn. Each person
takes a different amount of time but often

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:16.057
straight away, some people a
few weeks of practice.

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:19.631
TV Reporter: Okay, fantastic! Thank You!
What we'll do to, is, I think, put a link

00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:23.959
on our website, in case, anybody didn't catch, though but we appreciate it. Nice to see you Ramesh!

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.568
Dr. Manocha: Pleasure! Like wise.
