00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:17.200
Today we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.700
You all know the story of His birth and I need not repeat it.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:39.410
But, as He was created by the Mother only, by Adi Shakti,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.990
in the same way you are all created after Him.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.790
So, you are on the path of Shri Ganesha already.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.370
Your eyes sparkle the same way His eyes sparkle.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.950
You all have the beautiful glow on your face as He had.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.120
Whether you are small, big or old makes no difference.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.990
All the beauty comes to us through the glow of Shri Ganesha.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.330
If He's satisfied, then we don't have to worry

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.290
about any other deities,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.500
because the power of all the deities is Shri Ganesha.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.040
He's like a vice-chancellor sitting on every chakra.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.870
Unless and until He signs, Kundalini cannot cross through,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.750
because Kundalini’s the Gauri and is the Virgin Mother of Shri Ganesh.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.120
Now we have to understand that we are here

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.540
in the Western society where so much has gone wrong

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.500
because we never bother to look after Shri Ganesha.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.250
Christ came and His message spread all over the world.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:43.500
He talked of things which are not practised by Christians, not at all.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.660
Because whatever they started is not based on truth.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.250
Truth is that Shri Ganesha took birth as Christ.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.000
If that is the truth, then they have to understand

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.700
in the light of Shri Ganesha this great incarnation of Christ.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:28.040
That is, He has told people that “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.950
Actually, for a saint, He doesn’t know what is an adulterous eyes,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.540
because He just sees. He just sees.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.910
As Shri Gyaneshwara’s beautifully said, NIRANJANABANI

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.080
to see without any reaction, just to see.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.830
That is the quality of innocence, which was brought to light by Christ,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.500
our Lord, but we did not imbibe anyone of these qualities.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.000
Now supposing you are worshipping today Shri Ganesh.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.120
So why are you worshipping Shri Ganesha?

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.870
You’re worshipping because your Ganesha must be awakened,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.290
that you should have the qualities of Shri Ganesha within you,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.580
that you should feel that innocence in your eyes.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.040
Otherwise you are a hypocrite.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.500
If you are sitting here and worshipping Shri Ganesha

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:59.080
and you are not trying to put your attention to your ascent

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.910
as Shri Ganesh, then it is useless.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:17.950
And then He is an eternal child. He doesn't have ego,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.750
He doesn't have any conditionings. So, He’s an eternal child.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.790
We have to become eternal children of our Mother.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.870
To get to that state, what do we have to do is simple,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.250
that o to raise our Kundalini, fix it up,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.990
o to do meditation and o keep our attention inside,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.040
more, and o not to react.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.540
Now, to say not to react means just to watch.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:17.750
And when you watch without thinking about it, then the truth,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.870
which is really poetry, comes out.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.370
That's why a poet sees much more than an ordinary person can see.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:40.830
The inner’s beauty just starts penetrating your vision

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.080
and you start seeing it.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.450
So, you have seen children, whatever may be their origin,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.660
from whatever country they might be coming, whether it is Japan

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.000
or whether it is England, India, Australia, anywhere,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.370
see the children are normally very beautiful.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.660
Once I went to Japan and there was a shrine they wanted Me to see,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.250
so I saw some ladies coming down - three, four ladies.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.580
They’re western ladies. They said, “Don’t go. Don’t go.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.500
There are some children - horrible.”

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.500
I said, “Why?”

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.620
“They call you witch. They called us all,

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.950
“Witches, witches, witches”, Japanese children.”

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.660
I said, “How do you know? They must be saying in Japanese.”

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.370
“No, we asked the meaning,

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.370
so they told us it means witches.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.500
We look like witches to them, so better not go.”

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.790
I said, “It’s all right. Let Me go.” And when I went up,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.750
they all came running, clung to Me, kissed Me, this thing.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.990
They wouldn’t allow Me to go to the shrine

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.950
and then they walked all the way to the shrine, they came back.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.540
I didn’t know their language or anything. So sweet.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.830
Kissing My sari, kissing My hand, so sweet they were.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.450
And I was surprised that how is it they call the other ladies

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.500
as witches and to Us, to Me, and My daughters were also with us.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.700
And My daughters are very fond of children.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.950
So then they said, “You see, why to go to the shrine?

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.330
We’ll play with the children.”

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.160
I said, „Let’s go to the shrine, after all.“

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.950
So when we went up, these children also came with us

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.370
and walked down. And their mothers were so surprised, you see,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.120
they said normally to all the foreigners,

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:49.120
to all the foreigners they say „witches“ or even to men

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.250
they say they are devils. „Devils are coming.“

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.700
Because Japanese are short people, you see,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.540
and the size of our Western people are quite big

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.660
and perhaps maybe that is the reason, whatever it is

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.750
or maybe something else, I don’t know.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.750
And they wouldn’t, I mean, even talk to them.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.040
They all ran away, calling them, „Witches, witches“,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.450
from the windows and from every corner. Then I realized, you see,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.500
these small, little children, their Ganesha is awakened in them.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.160
Everybody's Ganesha is awakened when you are born.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.250
All the animals have their Ganesha intact with them,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.450
specially the birds. We never think how birds,

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.910
all the way from Siberia go to Australia.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.750
What direction comes to them, from where?

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.370
They have got a magnet within themselves. That is Shri Ganesh.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.750
Magnet is Shri Ganesha.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:10:03.410
So, this magnet, which is within us can attract innocent people

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.160
and repel cunning, horrible

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.620
as they call witch and devils and all those.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.370
So this magnet has both the qualities,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.870
that it repels those who are not all right

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.870
and it attracts those who are innocent.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.870
And that is why in Sahaja Yoga we find that we cannot tolerate

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.500
some people somehow or other, we try, we try, we try.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.290
But somehow or other it’s a bit difficult, you know.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.000
They don’t know what is the reason. The reason is Ganesha.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.660
Now, in the Western society, as you know,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.790
not that they’ve not paid any attention to their Ganesha quality,

00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:00.540
but they have talked too much about the perversion of Shri Ganesha.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.620
They talk on the television, they talk here, there, in every way.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
The children see it and so many small, little children are suffering

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.830
from Shri Ganesh problem, very small children.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:24.700
How do they get into these problems is because of the atmosphere is full of it.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.040
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also we have some people

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:34.410
who just stick on hypocritically and they have Ganesha problem.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:40.330
And there are some who support. This fellow can say,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.660
„Oh, I was such a sick man, I had no wife

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.370
or I’ve had no love from my parents“ or anything

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.910
and others start supporting.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.950
This kind of sympathy is very dangerous, is extremely dangerous.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.910
First of all, this sympathy ruins that person

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.200
who cannot get over his problems and gradually

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.290
you also pick up these problems. Instead of helping him,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.500
that you do the meditation of Ganesha,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:20.080
you just sit on the Mother Earth, say „Atharva Sheersha“,

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.080
use the candle. Your problem will go away. Instead of that,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.500
they start sympathizing. This is not sympathy.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.830
It’s sym-pathy. „Sym“ means „to share“, „Pathy“ means „pathos.“

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.040
So you share all the problems of that person yourself.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.620
So, never support a wrong thing.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.080
If you really love that person, you care for that person,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.950
you have to tell that person, "This is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong."

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.870
Moreover, in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people of seventy years

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.120
also want to get married. I can’t understand, you know.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:09.160
After all, loneliness is not possible in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.250
you have so many Sahaja Yogis. Where is the loneliness?

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.660
I never feel lonely. I would love to be sometimes.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.290
If you are not with Me, My family is with Me.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:31.660
I’m never alone and I’m never alone when I’m alone, really.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.620
I enjoy Myself best when I’m alone

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.080
because I have time to reflect back as to what we have achieved,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:47.700
as to how these moments were beautiful moments of meeting you all,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:55.080
all those beautiful places I visited with you, all the enjoyments.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.910
So all such people who are explaining

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.330
their problems of Mooladhara have to know one thing,

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.660
that this is a sure certificate for them

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.080
to go to hell, absolutely.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.080
Because either from the Mooladhara, you know,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.120
all kinds of diseases come in which are incurable,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.990
according to the doctor. Say, you take multiple sclerosis.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.950
From multiple sclerosis through all the disabilities of the muscles,

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:40.990
even cancers could be started by Mooladhara problem.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.750
Why is it so much cancer in the Western countries

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:52.910
than in any other countries? Everybody has an explanation.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.080
Somebody said there are not so many doctors of cancer,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.330
that’s why there are. It’s not so.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.620
Now, you see the disease of schizophrenia

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.870
also can come from Mooladhara problem.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.620
Of course, you know AIDS is nothing but Mooladhara problem.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.370
But still, if you want to make a martyrdom out of that, that

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.910
„We are AIDS soldiers walking to our death,“

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.750
then what can you do to such stupid people?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.700
And stupidity comes also from Mooladhara,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.540
because He is the giver of wisdom.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.540
How do you get the wisdom?

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.410
Only by awakening your Shri Ganesh. He is the giver of wisdom.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:06.870
Now, all kinds of people do stupidities, unbelievable - unbelievable.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.080
Like in India recently I asked them for bigger bangles,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:19.290
for the ladies have bigger hands here and they came back

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.370
to say that these days all big bangles are going to America.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.830
So why?

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.540
Because the men have decided to wear bangles in America.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.540
Now in India, if you give one bangle to any man,

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.910
means an insult to him that „You are not a man.“

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.870
All such stupidities, hundred and one, I tell you,

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.370
you see all over the world now because have come out of it.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.250
All kinds of things come because their Mooladhara is not all right.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:05.290
In India now, for example, we all wear saris. Nobody knows.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.200
I mean, logically also we should wear saris

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.660
because saris are made by villagers and they earn out of it

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.330
and that’s how we support this thing. Culturally,

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:20.830
we like it also because it suggests we are shy women,

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.830
we don’t want to expose our body too much and thirdly,

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.040
it’s very good for the mothers,

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.790
that mothers can nurse the children and look after them.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:42.000
So, it has various aspects, but nobody thinks the logic of it.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.160
They think it’s very practical and it has been there for traditions.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.040
Now, supposing you say, „All right, come along,

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.120
give up your saris and wear something else,“

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.990
they’ll say, „Now, tell us another. No, no. Nothing doing.“

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:06.370
Nobody would accept it. Nobody would accept it, because they think

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.160
that saris are more gracious, they make you look like a woman.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.910
There’s so much beautiful dress

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:17.450
and it does give chance for the artist to express themselves.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.700
But this is only some intellectuals might be thinking,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.750
but normally in the villages, if you tell them that you change over,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.700
they say, „No.“ So nothing like a fashion can work out.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.990
Nothing like a fashion can work out

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.540
because traditionally now they have reached certain stage of wisdom,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.830
„Now, this is the best suited for us.“

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.370
So they won’t accept any nonsense.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.200
Ha, if it is something sensible, which is never so,

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.330
I would say, from the West, they may.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.120
But because the Western people have lost their wisdom,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.790
there is nothing that comes sensible to India, nothing.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.830
And whatever sensible they have, that is also going out.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.290
Yesterday you heard such beautiful waltz.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.580
I mean who plays these days waltz?

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:17.370
Thousands will gather at some sort of a noisy pop, hard music,

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.580
which can penetrate into your ears and can make you deaf.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.620
There’s no wisdom in all these things.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.330
They want all the time some sort of a sensation.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.580
I was told people come here for skiing.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.080
Now some I saw people jumping with a parachute.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.910
Ask an Indian. He’ll say, „You better do it.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.750
I’m not here to break my legs.“

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.500
That he understands the wisdom that

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.080
„My body is more important than anything else.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.870
What is this sensation for?“

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:56.370
The skiing, so many people have seen, they’ve lost their kidneys.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.990
They have lost their legs. They’ll have artificial legs for skiing.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:07.370
This sensation comes as a great attraction for people

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:13.660
who have no wisdom. It doesn't appeal to the wisdom.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:22.700
So, the people who are wise don’t take to stupid things.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:32.950
Though Shri Ganesha is the child, but He is the giver of wisdom.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.750
So we can say our children are the giver of wisdom

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.330
if we keep them on the line of wisdom.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.290
You listen to them, how they talk, how wisely they talk.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.120
Sometimes they have a conference with Me

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.990
and they tell Me all about you people, what you are up to

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.620
and they take Me into confidence completely and say that

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.330
„Don’t tell uncle or auntie, but we’ll tell You this.“

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.830
And small, small things they say, that „auntie was wearing the sari

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.870
You gave her and then, you know, she put it on the ground.“

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.000
All little, little things they know, so sweet they are.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.080
See yesterday how they came rushing and kissed Me so sweet,

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:27.200
without them the world would have been like a desert without any flowers, you know.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.040
So, Shri Ganesha has created you.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.950
Because of Him, you were born.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.750
He’s the one who looked after you when you were in the womb of the mother.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:48.830
He's the one who saw to it that you are born at the right time.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.040
He’s the one who has looked after your nourishment, everything.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.410
He's the one who has looked after your development of the fetus,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.160
of the brain and everything.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.910
All is done that by this great personality, Shri Ganesh.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:11.120
How much we owe to Him. Apart from that,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:16.500
He gives us the basic wisdom. I mean, a villager,

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.990
supposing you talk to a villager who is not exposed

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.540
to all these non-sensical sensations, you’ll find him

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.370
extremely practical and wise.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:32.200
There’s a story that one villager was travelling by train with other boys

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.790
who were very flamboyant and thinking that they were very smart.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.370
So, they were trying to tease the man.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.370
So, a boy asked a question to him.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:53.870
„Now, if the butter is selling for one pound, for a quarter of a pound,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:23:00.700
what will be the price of the egg in the next station?“

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.120
He looked at him. He said, „All right, you tell me what.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.370
Then, you cannot tell the price of the egg,

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:23.080
then can you tell me the price, can you tell me my age?“

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.500
He looked at him. He said, „You must be twenty-two.“

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.580
He said. „How do you know?“

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.330
He said, „I have a brother who is eleven years and he is half mad,

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.660
but you are full mad.“

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.660
So, an ordinary villager answered this smart fellow

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.500
and the smart fellow didn’t know where to go.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:11.250
So, all this smartness and cleverness finishes off

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.500
when it comes to innocence.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:22.910
Now, many people have a feeling also that we have lost our innocence.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:27.620
That is something, an eternal quality you have got.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.830
You never lose your innocence.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.620
Maybe, as clouds can cover the whole sky,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.200
maybe your ego and conditionings and your mistakes

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:44.620
might have covered it, but it is always there, always there.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:51.000
Only thing, it is for you to respect it, to behave in a manner

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.290
that you respect your innocence.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.200
Not to feel shy about your innocence, never.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.580
Your innocence itself is a power and your innocence

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:15.540
will definitely give you that wisdom by which

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:20.040
you can solve all the problems without any difficulty.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.120
But in a deeper way, if you see who is Shri Ganesha,

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.370
He is the child of Adi Shakti.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.000
She created Him from the Aumkara.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.750
Now, Aumkara is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:53.250
when Sadashiva and Adi Shakti separated, for creation.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:26:00.410
That sound is used as Aumkara which are vibrations,

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:14.160
which have light in it. They have all the causals of all the elements,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.200
only on the right side.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:24.410
Then left side, it has the power of your emotions.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.080
In the centre it has the power of your ascent.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:39.700
So it's a very powerful deity we have and He's playful.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:46.830
Children are seldom cruel. He's not cruel,

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:56.330
but if anything is done against the Mother, then He goes all wild.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:04.080
Then He punishes and that is how the divine justice is brought to people.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.990
Thus, if we surrender to Shri Ganesh, He protects us,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.580
He gives us wisdom, He gives a proper understanding,

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.790
the protocol of the Mother.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.910
He does not know any other deity but His Mother.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:33.080
He doesn't bother about any other deity but His Mother,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.910
and He knows that She’s the most powerful deity.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:45.620
And this is His wisdom, which must be imbibed.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.080
When you pray, you must try to imbibe that.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:28:00.750
For many people are still in the West anxious to copy other people,

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.160
fall back into the wrong ideas,

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:13.450
which have really kept them away from the Truth.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Thank God you all have come out of it

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.990
and when you see the hell into which the Western society has fallen,

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:29.580
you try to understand and enjoy that you are at a different state altogether.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.500
But still, among you there will be some who will be dangling.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.540
Try to pull them out, not to throw them inside

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.080
and go also with them.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.870
If you sympathize with them, you’ll go down with them.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.000
Try to pull them out and tell them that „you have to come out“.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.040
It maybe little painful to them, doesn’t matter, but they’ll be saved.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.500
So you are here as saviours and you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.500
which is to be used. So today's Puja

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.290
is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:09.500
„Shri Ganesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.870
that You manifest within ourselves.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.410
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.120
and all these wrong ideas we have

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.200
or all the wrong life we have had,

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:32.750
should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.580
of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.”

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.250
Let us manifest these qualities.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.950
This is what is to be asked.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.790
Today is a great day. I’m very happy we are in Austria,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:56.660
which I call is the country of divine weapons.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.500
It’s a very wonderful country, as I told you before

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.910
that there is no fundamentalism here.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.910
It’s very surprising, but I have discovered that in Austria

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.870
there have been people from all over the world

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.330
and they have been married here, it’s a small country,

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.750
so they all kept together. It’s a very nice place,

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.500
specially this place where we are.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.830
I heard that it’s called as the holy land of Tyrol.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.200
And we also saw lots of grace falling down with our eyes.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.790
Everybody could see them, the grace coming down.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.750
There was no rain, but you could see the grace.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.990
Moreover, yesterday, the villagers remarked that this river overflows.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:47.660
The whole glacier comes down and this river overflows,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.200
but it did not. It kept to its maryadas.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.910
They are quite surprised how it has happened

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.950
that it kept to its maryadas.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:31:05.580
This is one thing and the second thing is they said

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:13.750
that they have never heard such great, absolutely volcanic,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.700
roaring of the clouds, they’ve never heard such reports before

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.620
and it was really remarkable it rained so heavily

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.450
everything happened and we are all right.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.620
Only in the central path of Sushumna it cleared out.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.910
Maybe because I had to walk through that, so it cleared out that part.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.000
But on the whole, all our programs went off very well

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.540
and we all enjoyed the last night’s program

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.990
and the musician also lost all count of time,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.990
he played for four hours on his own.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.250
I thought he’d just play one raga.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.000
He went on and he wanted to play more, but then,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.620
thank God, he thought of the puja perhaps and he stopped it.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:05.790
So, let us try to be innocent within our self.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.500
Be proud that we are innocent.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.410
We need not be smart people.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.080
Smartness is your mental attitude

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:20.120
and innocence is your innate quality

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.250
which is connected with this all-pervading power.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.000
So, may God bless you all!

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.330
At least during the Puja there should not be

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.540
any movements outside or nearby.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.990
If the children are sitting, well and good,

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:51.040
otherwise you can go out. But you shouldn’t disturb others

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.000
because their attention goes to you.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.410
So, all those who are having any movements,

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.620
all of you also should come and sit with your children.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.370
Why can’t your children sit down?

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.370
They will sit, bring them in.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.830
Or if they are not sitting you go behind the curtain,

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.000
because they get disturbed, you see, there are Sahaja Yogis still

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.120
who are getting disturbed very easily

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.160
with the slightest movement here and there.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.790
So, the first thing is to open your heart for Shri Ganesha.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.750
As you see a child, how your heart opens.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.500
In the same way, please open your hearts.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.750
All right …

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.790
Ah, see, one thing is that He has got a hunter in His hand

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:58.000
and if you remember Christ used a hunter to hit all the people,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.910
who were selling goods near the temple.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:09.080
He could have used any other weapon, but He used a hunter.
