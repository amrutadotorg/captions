1
00:00:04,114 --> 00:00:08,480
Gregoire has said so many things that I 
really don’t know what to say after that.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,800
Really dumbfounded.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:29,840
I know it’s a fact and you have to 
face it, though I’m bashful about it.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:47,040
You were all seeking, and I think from the time I 
remember I haven’t met anyone who was not seeking.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,840
They may be seeking in money, in power.

6
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,960
But so many of them were really 
seeking something beyond.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,360
In the West, I always felt  

8
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,400
all the great sages of the old and the 
ancient times who were seeking God, are born.

9
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
I could see, the way you 
have abhorred materialism;  

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,480
the way you have achieved a kind of a 
understanding about life… is new thing.

11
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,120
At the time of Christ it was 
not possible to see such people  

12
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,080
except for some lepers and some sickly people.

13
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
There was nobody else who 
was willing to look at Him.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Times have changed no doubt.

15
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,720
But, in this seeking, many people 
have committed lots of mistakes.

16
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,840
Mistakes can be forgiven always.

17
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,040
They should be rectified.

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
I’ve been born with this.

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,760
I knew I had to do this and I knew 
I had to be in London one day.

20
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
All the people who are of a very 
high, evolved status, I can say,  

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,280
who do not live in the humdrum of life, who 
do not roam about as gurus and earn money,  

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,520
who do not claim to be pundits and 
the temples’ and the priest people,  

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,080
those who live away from all of you, 
hiding themselves in the jungles,  

24
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,960
they knew it was to happen.

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,000
They knew about it.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:17,840
But when the seeking started in the 
West, like a demand the supply came in.

27
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,160
We have so many Sahaja Yogis here sitting down.

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
I would say they are real 
seekers because they reunite to fight.

29
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,640
not clear – “denied” sounds 
like “renite”], defied.

30
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,920
There few things, you can make it out 
very easily when we have, before us,  

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,120
the life of Christ, by which you can make 
out who is the true person and who is not.

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
It’s not difficult.

33
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:54,000
For example, a person who takes money from you, 
cannot be, cannot be a person who belongs to God.

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
Person who belongs to God doesn’t 
think much of money or anything.

35
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
If he’s rich, he lives like a rich person.

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
If he’s poor, he lives like a poor 
person; but at heart he’s a king.

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Christ was a son of a carpenter.

38
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,120
I see His pictures and I see His 
Mother’s pictures adorned with jewellery.

39
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,840
She had only two robes to change.

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,520
Perhaps it was never realized 
that money cannot purchase God.

41
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,520
In the name of God and religion 
things have gone so far, so far  

42
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,360
that I do not blame human beings for 
taking to science, instead of God.

43
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,760
The misinterpretation has been 
so much, one can understand.

44
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,680
But when there are so many false 
things in the world – copies –  

45
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,280
then one must know that there 
must be something… absolute.

46
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,920
Has to be.

47
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,960
London is regarded by all those I 
have been describing about, the people  

48
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,800
who are great sages, all 
over the world, as the heart.

49
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
It saddens Me to see sometimes how  

50
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,840
people of England have not realized 
the value of this great country.

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,840
In this country, long time, much before,  

52
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,400
much before even Christ came in, 
people have worked with Kundalini.

53
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:06,640
Your Stonehenge is nothing but the Kundalini.

54
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,040
Vibrations have worked in 
this country for ages now.

55
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,640
Only I am here to introduce you to them.

56
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
There is some gentleman I saw 
copying this Kundalini that  

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,040
we have already made for you, all the 
drawings and everything, for you to see and  

58
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,560
to understand where are, what are the
chakras and what are the deities ruling them.

59
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,920
You should not accept Me even when Gregoire 
has told you all about these things.

60
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,280
Could be wrong.

61
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,960
No blind faith is going to lead 
you to reality, not at all.

62
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,960
By saying “Just believe me”, is a wrong style.

63
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,560
You should not.

64
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,040
But you should not also deny Me.

65
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,040
Keep it open.

66
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:08,080
For you are seeking and if 
I have to just enlighten you  

67
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,000
because you should enlighten other 
people, one should not feel hurt about it.

68
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Somebody has to do it.

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,960
You may be in this place 
or I may be in your place.

70
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,840
Makes no difference.

71
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:33,120
If there’s a candle, which is enlightened, which
can enlighten other lights if they are ready,

72
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,080
then it’s, maybe,

73
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,160
that I may be knowing all the tricks of the trade.

74
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,320
I may be having all the knowledge about it.

75
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240
It may be worth it to know
all about that.

76
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Let us not be very serious about it, just 
because Gregoire has struck such a serious note.

77
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,640
It’s just a play.

78
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,160
It’s just a play.

79
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,040
It’s not that serious as we think it to be.

80
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,920
It has to be a play because it is so important.

81
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,840
All those things that are important are 
easiest for us – example: our breathing.

82
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Supposing for learning how to breathe, if 
you have to go to Caxton Hall in the rain,  

83
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,000
walk all the way, listen to a big lecture 
and then learn about it, you’d be finished.

84
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,640
In the same way if we have to get our realization 
by standing on our heads or by renouncing the  

85
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
whole world or, I don’t know, dancing on 
the Oxford Street and all sorts of things,  

86
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,840
then God save all the people who are seeking.

87
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,920
It has to be extremely simple –  

88
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:09,200
has to work out that way – because if evolution 
is complete, we would not have been in confusion.

89
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,040
It is not complete, that’s why we are confused.

90
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,600
‘Til the animal stage, there is 
no question of thinking about it.

91
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,160
Only when you become human beings 
you start thinking about it.

92
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,760
Only at the human stage you are 
given freedom to think about it.

93
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,920
Animals are in collective consciousness all the 
time – in the sense they are not conscious of it,  

94
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
but they are driven by it.

95
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,360
[pause in recording, Shri Mataji 
seems to be referring to a book]

96
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,280
…that the whole nature works in such a manner  

97
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:54,960
as if there are some organizer which are arranging 
their coordination, their harmony, their working.

98
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,640
Not only that but the death of one 
thing helps to give life to another.

99
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,440
For example, in the nature the leaves have to fall 
down to the ground to give nitrogen to the ground.

100
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Again, to be again renovated, say… you 
can say, regenerated into the body of the  

101
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,800
tree to come again into its 
new foliage and to its bloom.

102
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:35,760
All kinds of… we can say, real
experiments he [the author] has given;

103
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,320
but if you now go and read it you will know
he’s just talking about the collective be-ing,

104
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:50,720
the mass be-ing that is there, the one in which we
all exist as Self, and that He is looking after  

105
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:59,840
us in every way; and how everything in nature is
interdependent; how animals understand; and how

106
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,240
every amoeba and paramecium – is a unicellular
cell – also understands: what its group is doing

107
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,480
and what are the signals and how he receives
it; how bees understand where is the  

108
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,040
honey and how they go and come back the 
same way – there are no road-maps, nothing.

109
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
Miles together how do they travel?

110
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,880
It’s very interesting.

111
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,880
And there are many books like 
this, which you can find from  

112
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,560
any biologist. Another is Du Noüy,
he’s a great biologist, I must say.

113
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,160
Biologists, because they deal with life, I 
think they are very much nearer the point.

114
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,560
Another one is Jung who had experimented 
with collective consciousness.

115
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,840
He says that there are dreams we 
get which are universally the same  

116
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
as far as the symbol is concerned.

117
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,120
The symbols that they see whether here or 
in India or in Australia or in Timbuktu.

118
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,800
They’re all… when decoded… expressing the same thing.

119
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,920
For example if it has to express a fear, 
harmony, anything, it expresses that.

120
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
It’s surprising.

121
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,640
After all there is somebody who is throwing 
these symbols in the atmosphere where we live.

122
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,840
From our unconscious, he says, these are coming.

123
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,240
But all these things are like the finding 
of people who are probing in the dark:  

124
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,280
they find something here and find something there, 
you find something there and you put it together.

125
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,120
All these things can be put together.

126
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
All these things can be bridged 
together, integrated together  

127
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,200
and can be shown, very easily, 
if you get your self-realization.

128
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Self within you, is in your heart.

129
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,520
Your Self.

130
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,960
You know there is somebody who 
knows everything about you.

131
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,480
There is someone.

132
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,600
If you murder someone, That one knows.

133
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
If you do anything, That one knows.

134
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
And That one that knows is the Self.

135
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Now when we talk of God, people have already 
negated God: they say, “Where is God?

136
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,600
Let us see."

137
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,880
Without self-realization, you cannot know Him.

138
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
You cannot know Him through all these 
so-called conditionings that we have.

139
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,640
Like we go to churches and pray, 
go to the temples and pray,  

140
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,360
sing songs and mantras and this and that.

141
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,600
No.

142
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,720
You cannot know Him through these 
things because still you are outside.

143
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,920
You have to come inside.

144
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,960
You’ve done all the steps, everything, you
have to come inside, inside the door,  

145
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
sit down and receive it.

146
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:05,440
Self-knowledge is not the knowledge that: 
you are a sinner, you are good for nothing  

147
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,960
or you are a king or you are such and such.

148
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
This is all outside.

149
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,000
Self-knowledge is that, 
that you are an instrument.

150
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,720
You are an instrument and you have to act 
for the dynamic forces of that Dynamic One,  

151
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,960
the vast personality whom we call as God Almighty.

152
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,800
You are that.

153
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,560
Only thing is your instrument 
is not yet connected with That.

154
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,720
I said ‘til the animal stage we are one with it.

155
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,920
We have no problems.

156
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,720
Only when we become human beings then the diagram
shows there you see on the left the black,  

157
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,920
right the black and another 
side is the yellow-coloured in the head.

158
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,440
These are the two balloons, which grow 
with our activity, ego and superego.

159
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,520
And they cover our head completely, by which 
this fontanel bone, which is a soft bone  

160
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,000
in the childhood –you have seen children they’re 
so much one with the collective consciousness –  

161
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,360
when it becomes hardened up there it 
is because these two meet and overlap.

162
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,480
Man is made like that.

163
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,160
He has been given the freedom.

164
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
He has been given the ‘I’ness.

165
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,960
He develops this special thing.

166
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,840
He has been given freedom because this 
is the last stage of evolution now.

167
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,480
Man has to jump by himself-understanding it.

168
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,800
You do not know how you became human 
beings from amoeba to this stage.

169
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,560
But human beings will have to know 
how they become one with themselves  

170
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,720
and how they enter into the kingdom of God.

171
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,680
That is their right and to have this 
right they must have freedom and they  

172
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,880
must develop their wisdom and discretion, 
their temperance, – how to use that freedom.

173
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,200
For this purpose, in our 
being there is already placed  

174
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,960
a residual power, which is called as 
Kundalini, at the base of the spine.

175
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,680
It is there.

176
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
Now.

177
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,200
Many Sahaja Yogis, I would say thousands, in 
America and in India, and also other places,  

178
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,000
have seen it with their own eyes the 
pulsation of the Kundalini at that spine.

179
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,880
If there is obstruction in the 
stomach by some disease or may be some  

180
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,920
other trouble then this pulsation is much 
heavier and you can see the Kundalini pulsating.

181
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,040
Very clearly.

182
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,240
The pulsation travels upward 
when the Kundalini rises.

183
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,440
You can see that also.

184
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:31,280
You can also feel the different chakras – is the 
centers – which are placed inside the spinal cord,  

185
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,680
not outside as some books have written.

186
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,360
All kinds of funny things they 
have written about Kundalini.

187
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,880
Anybody who felt like writing has written.

188
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,000
From the books they have taken something, 
they have written such big, big books.

189
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,080
It’s shocking because this is a 
very subtle thing and a holy thing.

190
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,920
Most auspicious.

191
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,840
The way they have handled Kundalini 
is something one cannot imagine.

192
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:13,680
The most highest and the holiest of 
all has been insulted, has been ruined  

193
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,040
by this kind of half-baked people 
just for earning some money.

194
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,960
How long do you carry your money with you?

195
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you to carry it with you all your lives?

196
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,960
Or for cheating people or for overpowering 
some people – all kinds of things have  

197
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,800
been done in this world in the name 
of God, in the name of Kundalini.

198
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:48,400
It really sometimes amazes me, how people are 
really seriously giving sermons and talking  

199
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,840
big in the name of God, wearing diamonds 
all over… bought by somebody else’s money.

200
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:07,040
And how can we the thinkers, the ones who have 
got brains, accept such a situation where we find,  

201
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,400
where we find that those who are so 
much interested in all these things  

202
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
and are trying to impress others 
by getting it from others.

203
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,960
We have been really misled.

204
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,243
It’s a sad thing.

205
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:27,840
It’s the saddest story.

206
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,400
It wrenches my heart,  

207
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:43,200
but I feel the innocent, the simple, the seekers… 
the seekers have been the greatest victims.

208
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,440
They have been – for money,  

209
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,200
for vindictiveness, and also there 
are satanic forces that have come up.

210
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
They are trying also to exploit.

211
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,680
They have come in their complete force, 
in their full regiment they are up here.

212
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,840
It’s hard to understand for you people 
how you are gradually dragged into their  

213
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
clutches and into their jaws and 
they’re about to just clutch you.

214
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:34,240
But you must know that God did not 
create this creation to be destroyed.

215
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,800
He did not create you to be destroyed.

216
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,600
There’s nothing more powerful than God Himself  

217
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,160
and it is going to work out and 
you all are going to get it.

218
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,000
I have no doubts about it.

219
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
I have no doubts.

220
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,080
Maybe some of you may not get it today.

221
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,640
Possibly.

222
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,600
But you can’t say that you 
will not get it tomorrow.

223
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:10,320
You will and you all should 
have it because you are seekers.
