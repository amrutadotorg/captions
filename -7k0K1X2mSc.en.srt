1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,760
You hold your breath three times.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,063
And think in your heart that I am the mother of the universe

3
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:17,890
That’s all! This will… This has to be corrected

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,239
That’s a problem there, that’s why.

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,824
Unless and until you correct this problem, the attention,

6
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:25,530
but not only attention but kundalini goes there.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,495
So you have to correct that thing.

8
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:29,941
Which I noticed yesterday: you have a center heart

9
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:33,523
But you have come to SY now I mean a few days back

10
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:36,016
You’ll get corrected in no time. Alright?

11
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:44,628
They have to put your right hand towards the photograph,

12
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:46,722
the left hand here

13
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:54,680
And you have to hold your breath. All of you can do it.

14
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:57,901
Hold your breath

15
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:01,925
And say: Jagadamba, Jagadamba, Jagadamba.

16
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:06,122
You are holding the breath; so how can you say?

17
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:09,235
You have to think.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,550
Now leave it.

19
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,497
And then hold it once more.

20
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:29,520
Put your left hand. Right hand towards Me.

21
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:35,860
Good. Now leave it.

22
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,728
Again hold it.

23
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:53,536
Now leave it. Alright?

24
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,842
May God bless you.
