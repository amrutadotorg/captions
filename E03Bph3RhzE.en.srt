1
00:00:02,344 --> 00:00:06,844
It was very spontaneously decided

2
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:16,804
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

3
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:26,078
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

4
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,717
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

5
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:33,717
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

6
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:50,509
We have to today understand

7
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:55,325
that why do we do Devi Puja?

8
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,390
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

9
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,940
What do we get out of it?

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,735
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

11
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:16,049
within ourselves?

12
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:25,927
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

13
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:30,157
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

14
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,817
So when you worship Devi,

15
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:39,219
first you worship also your own Kundalini

16
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:46,384
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

17
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,918
It’s much deeper understanding

18
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,847
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

19
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:57,428
because they are not realized souls.

20
00:01:57,588 --> 00:02:00,079
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

21
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,590
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,566
of getting realization

23
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,205
so that the Devi should be pleased

24
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:11,927
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

25
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:15,337
or must get our chance to get to somebody

26
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:19,045
who will give them realization.

27
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,534
But you are at a different level now.

28
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:28,124
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

29
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:30,550
and to Adi Shakti,

30
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,379
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

31
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,062
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

32
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:47,214
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

33
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:53,426
But one has to know that

34
00:02:53,802 --> 00:03:02,061
only we are realized souls is not the point,

35
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:07,101
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

36
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:14,022
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

37
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:20,830
Then what is it? Very important –

38
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,791
it’s the content within us.

39
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,734
What do we have within us is the point.

40
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:33,487
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

41
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,469
Supposing somebody is generous,

42
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:42,950
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

43
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,390
So the content within us, we have to see.

44
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:53,714
And when we start seeing the content,

45
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,096
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

46
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:10,321
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

47
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:16,384
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

48
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:22,119
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

49
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,463
and gives rain.

50
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:33,671
But sea is the lowest level,

51
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:35,872
stands at the lowest level

52
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:40,373
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

53
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,607
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

54
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:53,119
to be really achieving more content,

55
00:04:53,279 --> 00:05:03,039
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

56
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,871
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

57
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:11,022
but I think it was not explained to people.

58
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:16,296
Only the strong people can be meek,

59
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:19,543
secured people can be meek,

60
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:25,254
only the rich in essence can be meek,

61
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:31,881
not the people who are insecured.

62
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,621
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

63
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,438
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

64
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:48,584
because if they are rich they are not generous,

65
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:53,335
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

66
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:58,677
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

67
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:07,159
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

68
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:15,275
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

69
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:23,141
But when you love Me,

70
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:28,198
you have to know that there are certain qualities

71
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:32,398
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

72
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,726
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

73
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:41,726
They think they can get over everything,

74
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,206
they’re perfectly all right,

75
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:48,322
and they are thrown overboard.

76
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,085
So when we say that we have to be meek,

77
00:06:55,245 --> 00:07:00,608
this is a content, the humility is a content.

78
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,860
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

79
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,260
You’ll like yourself.

80
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,564
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

81
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:19,971
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

82
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:25,350
And what is another thing we find has content

83
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:29,053
are the great mountains,

84
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:32,500
because they have heights

85
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,892
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

86
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:41,380
So such a rapport there is

87
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,965
between the humility of the ocean

88
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,349
and the heights of the mountain.

89
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,661
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

90
00:07:54,821 --> 00:08:02,541
He is too high because so much of

91
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:10,980
content is there in that ocean,

92
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,340
then it has become beautiful

93
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:22,700
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

94
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,915
where resides the Shiva.

95
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:30,435
So it’s so joy-giving.

96
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:35,060
Of course as you have painted Me there,

97
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,340
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

98
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,900
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

99
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,860
in a very subtle manner,

100
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,100
because there’s so much of negativity

101
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:54,460
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

102
00:09:00,883 --> 00:09:04,940
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

103
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,474
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

104
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:13,475
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

105
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:16,836
there is a little blessing;

106
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:21,964
goes, I would say, a long rope.

107
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,380
But that long rope one should not care for.

108
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,060
You have to care for your own quality,

109
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,780
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

110
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,388
Now look at the ocean as it is.

111
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:50,211
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

112
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:57,005
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

113
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:00,548
Only possible in the ocean.

114
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,940
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

115
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,685
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

116
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:10,000
inexhaustible.

117
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:17,080
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

118
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:22,078
and that can go and touch the heart.

119
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:26,121
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

120
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:32,059
where there is Shiva residing.

121
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:37,823
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

122
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,807
and unless and until you have that largeness,

123
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:49,538
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

124
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:54,440
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

125
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,720
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

126
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
it never leaves.

127
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,560
If Pacific Ocean was

128
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,048
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

129
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:15,160
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

130
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,208
it has its own maryadas.

131
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:22,320
But in that maryada he has the feeling

132
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,088
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

133
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:29,897
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

134
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:35,124
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

135
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:40,680
Nature is bound by the Divine.

136
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
The Divine looks after the nature.

137
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,526
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

138
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:52,186
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

139
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,136
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

140
00:11:57,296 --> 00:12:04,520
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

141
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,176
You are above that like a mountain.

142
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:15,537
And so wherever there is a combination

143
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:20,898
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

144
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:25,352
Deep people can only come to such shores

145
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,207
where there is depth.

146
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,600
That’s how you achieve your depth,

147
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,960
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

148
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:41,633
that beautiful area where people can come to you

149
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:46,425
and just they know this is something great,

150
00:12:49,974 --> 00:12:53,440
everybody knows that.

151
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,720
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

152
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,574
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

153
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:07,200
But how many people come to My program?

154
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,345
How do they come to My program? Must think.

155
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:15,418
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

156
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:26,560
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

157
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,148
And people had no place to sit.

158
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,751
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

159
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:38,020
there are no books published, nothing.

160
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,080
So you can say that, “Mother,

161
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,942
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

162
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:53,542
I do not, but it does – I think so.

163
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,345
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

164
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:06,208
the collective unconscious,

165
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:11,968
the Divine will act, definitely act.

166
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,440
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

167
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,880
this that, yes people come.

168
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,200
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

169
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
But where there is no money involved,

170
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,728
no business involved, nothing,

171
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:36,465
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

172
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:42,167
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

173
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:47,520
So the Divine works it out.

174
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,095
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

175
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:59,447
then even if I am there it does not work.

176
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,967
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

177
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,665
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

178
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:11,471
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

179
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:15,408
a complete faith in yourself.

180
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:20,808
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

181
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,744
And what is this ocean?

182
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:29,264
It’s love, it’s love and love.

183
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,843
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

184
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,800
It just works spontaneously.

185
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,440
The less you do the better.

186
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,366
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

187
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:51,950
you just develop your content within yourself.

188
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,504
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

189
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:01,591
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

190
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:05,192
They had to go into jungles, they had to

191
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:09,207
take all the wrath of their gurus

192
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:13,963
and nobody to protect them.

193
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:19,834
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

194
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:24,360
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

195
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,280
whose power is all this Divine.

196
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,880
So you are at such an advantageous position.

197
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,865
But first you must realize.

198
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:40,920
So when we say we should have content,

199
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,280
then the vessel has to be strong

200
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:50,520
otherwise everything will break.

201
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,214
And this strength is the one you should know,

202
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:58,654
that you are completely protected.

203
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,089
No one can harm you.

204
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,376
They’ll try.

205
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:04,938
This has to be otherwise how will you test

206
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:08,320
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

207
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,726
So somebody has to try some tricks

208
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:17,826
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

209
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,200
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

210
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,386
everything will be cleared out.

211
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:24,984
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

212
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,864
how things have worked out.

213
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,640
So the strength comes.

214
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,180
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

215
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,985
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

216
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,688
Shraddha is not blind faith.

217
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:48,400
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

218
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,800
you know everything.

219
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,446
You’ve seen My photographs,

220
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,960
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

221
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,950
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

222
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,073
you can feel the vibrations;

223
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:11,271
you can feel others', you can cure others.

224
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:13,960
All this power is within you.

225
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,960
But just to realize

226
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:23,560
that power without ego is your strength.

227
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,960
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

228
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,296
because what is the need there?

229
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:32,120
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

230
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,864
because you want to have more, more, more.

231
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:41,596
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

232
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,952
So this power is to be ascertained first,

233
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:51,280
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

234
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,608
to find out first.

235
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:56,935
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

236
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,872
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

237
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:02,312
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

238
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:12,280
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

239
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,000
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

240
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,000
who have reached great heights and some

241
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,760
who are outside.

242
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,840
All these are negative forces

243
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,240
which were killed long time back.

244
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:38,248
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

245
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:44,258
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

246
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:48,615
but you have so many of them.

247
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,847
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

248
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,354
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

249
00:19:55,514 --> 00:20:00,194
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

250
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,113
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

251
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:17,246
you must have complete faith in yourself.

252
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,988
If you still doubt yourself,

253
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:26,440
that’s also a human quality.

254
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,033
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

255
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:34,048
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

256
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,800
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

257
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,240
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

258
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,726
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

259
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:49,446
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

260
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,320
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

261
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,120
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

262
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,945
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

263
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,903
I am still doing like this, then how?”

264
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:18,040
Then get rid of it!

265
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,960
I mean, how can I solve your problem

266
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,440
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

267
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,560
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

268
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,960
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

269
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,160
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

270
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,431
this is what is the answer.

271
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,378
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

272
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:42,230
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

273
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,536
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

274
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,970
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

275
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,477
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

276
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:02,440
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

277
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,344
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

278
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,292
None of them!

279
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,000
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

280
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,567
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

281
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:22,157
This is the, they could have said that

282
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:26,368
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

283
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:29,160
They had enough of everything, they must have.

284
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,053
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

285
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:35,622
very big professions, very humble,

286
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:41,293
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

287
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:43,960
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

288
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,448
They would even touch My sari like that.

289
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:50,254
The place I walk they would touch, just imagine.

290
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:55,730
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

291
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,022
How did they recognize Me?

292
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:04,734
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

293
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:07,455
And they never talked about God in that country.

294
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:09,735
They have some stupid people who have

295
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:15,565
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

296
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:19,920
most of the people are so strong

297
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
and the content is showing itself.

298
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,720
Imagine every time they have a program,

299
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,480
even now on follow-on,

300
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,880
at least one thousand people are there.

301
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:39,484
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

302
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,998
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

303
00:23:43,158 --> 00:23:46,120
from Siberia, this, that.

304
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,647
And they have booked themselves,

305
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:50,560
because there the halls you have to pay for.

306
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,840
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

307
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,030
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

308
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,096
not to work it out, take it easy,

309
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,880
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

310
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,800
We don’t have to kill demons.

311
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,240
There’s no need to join any war

312
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,800
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

313
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,920
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

314
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,805
lethargy from you, but work it out.

315
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,845
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

316
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:42,320
but you have to keep them awakened.

317
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,920
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

318
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,240
Not the way to meditate,

319
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,800
"All right, it’s like playing golf, sort of."

320
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,080
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

321
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,008
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

322
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:07,712
With that complete understanding and dedication

323
00:25:08,103 --> 00:25:13,680
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

324
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,044
It’s something very subtle and special.

325
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,216
In no action we can describe it,

326
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:31,160
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

327
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,800
To that depth no other feeling goes;

328
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:38,521
with that feeling you have to meditate.

329
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:40,629
And then see the results.

330
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,360
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

331
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,680
I’ve this still” –

332
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,520
because you are not deep enough.

333
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:58,000
It’s not how much you pray,

334
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,440
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

335
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,774
but it is how deeply you have touched

336
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:17,240
the feet of the Divine that is important.

337
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,275
So today we have to see that

338
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:30,387
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

339
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,120
so that all negativity runs away,

340
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,193
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

341
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:44,393
for Shiva to settle down.

342
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,480
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

343
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,840
It’s like an operation

344
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,360
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

345
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,640
you never even felt it.

346
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,760
The other day somebody gave Me a book of on the Devi's

347
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,160
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

348
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,480
– it’s correct, no doubt,

349
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,520
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

350
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,160
meaning 'without percussions'.

351
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080
But I was reading that book, I said,

352
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,040
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

353
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,360
going into ‘this means, that means'."

354
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,480
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

355
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,000
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

356
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,200
and they know it so easily.

357
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,880
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

358
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,360
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

359
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,160
has come to you so beautifully,

360
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,920
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

361
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,560
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

362
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,903
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

363
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:12,023
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

364
00:28:15,588 --> 00:28:18,641
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

365
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:21,565
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

366
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:24,120
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

367
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,480
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

368
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,518
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

369
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,760
You see, human beings are great experts,

370
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,520
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

371
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,938
Nothing goes inside the heart.

372
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:45,205
But you have to develop that depth.

373
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,440
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

374
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,160
not through our brains.

375
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:53,972
You have to develop that heart

376
00:28:56,342 --> 00:29:04,288
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

377
00:29:06,856 --> 00:29:11,999
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

378
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,033
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

379
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:16,857
Any intelligent man can see that,

380
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:19,285
there’s no need to have his realization.

381
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:22,320
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

382
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,640
and he trusts. He trusts

383
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,521
himself then because he’s wise.

384
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,575
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

385
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:39,408
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

386
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:45,512
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

387
00:29:45,672 --> 00:29:47,639
as you can see it clearly.

388
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,279
Of course, symbolically it is the same

389
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:56,534
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

390
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:01,534
The first work is to destroy the negativity

391
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,983
which is going on as you know.

392
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:07,279
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

393
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,085
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

394
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:14,925
But you are the lights.

395
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:19,400
You have to put the lights on

396
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:22,048
and you have to look after your light,

397
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:27,888
and you have to make that light eternal.

398
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:35,718
This is one work which you are doing.

399
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,160
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

400
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,760
is to spread light, enlighten people.

401
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,560
The negativity that is around you

402
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,520
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

403
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,453
Today it has become subtler.

404
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:00,280
The negativity has become subtler.

405
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,688
It’s entered into your being,

406
00:31:02,848 --> 00:31:07,807
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

407
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:13,926
Even one step

408
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,825
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

409
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,505
you can go down.

410
00:31:19,854 --> 00:31:23,665
So one has to be alert, without tension.

411
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:27,150
You have to be alert without tension.

412
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,880
And the alertness grows.

413
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,432
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

414
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:37,967
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

415
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:42,293
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

416
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:47,079
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

417
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,880
And immediately you take to it.

418
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,720
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

419
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,120
immediately you clean it.

420
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:07,745
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

421
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:10,695
'daksha' is the word for that.

422
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:14,801
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

423
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:17,280
Goddess used to give enlightenment

424
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,049
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

425
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:24,249
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

426
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,600
They are praying, they are doing puja,

427
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,409
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

428
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:34,397
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

429
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:36,816
from all negativity coming,

430
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:40,109
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

431
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:46,372
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

432
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,366
So you have to kill your negativity,

433
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:55,308
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

434
00:32:56,368 --> 00:33:00,648
No negativity can touch you.

435
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:06,207
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

436
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:12,727
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

437
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,400
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

438
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,760
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

439
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,263
By that nobody is going to gain.

440
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:30,313
At the collective level it just works automatically.

441
00:33:30,473 --> 00:33:32,084
You don’t have to worry.

442
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:36,480
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

443
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,640
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

444
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,520
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

445
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,040
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

446
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,940
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

447
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:57,841
Now another quality that you have:

448
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,400
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

449
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,480
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

450
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,160
it’s penetrated into you

451
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:14,720
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

452
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:22,202
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

453
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:25,680
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

454
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,208
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

455
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,680
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

456
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,240
you get the cool from there.

457
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,240
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

458
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,720
you give bliss to others.

459
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,360
But there is no bliss within yourself,

460
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,311
but what bliss you can give to others?

461
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:49,695
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

462
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,895
You see She has very extreme characters,

463
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:56,496
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

464
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:58,400
She can be very cruel,

465
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,695
and She can be extremely gentle

466
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:06,682
– like two ragas of yesterday.

467
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:21,397
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

468
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:25,328
beyond all human expectations,

469
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:31,888
and She could be extremely mild.

470
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:41,920
So this harsh part you need not have.

471
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
It will just work.

472
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,880
This part is only kept for the Divine.

473
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,718
You just take to the other side.

474
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:54,480
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

475
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
After all, Divine also must do some work.

476
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,920
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

477
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,854
So the Divine will look after that part.

478
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:13,190
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

479
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,925
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

480
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:20,263
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

481
00:36:20,423 --> 00:36:23,104
their love – everything She enjoys.

482
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,541
In the same way you have to enjoy.

483
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,360
You have to know about everything,

484
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,426
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

485
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,180
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

486
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,060
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

487
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,668
At the most!

488
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:52,540
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

489
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,820
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

490
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,492
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

491
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:01,180
And you are on the stage,

492
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,500
so they are looking out what to focus light,

493
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,260
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

494
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,660
what is to be changed around.

495
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,605
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

496
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:15,045
So you need not do all that work.

497
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:20,364
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

498
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:25,141
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

499
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:32,341
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

500
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:36,547
So to leave certain things into the hands

501
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:41,889
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

502
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,484
And that much of this, if done, then

503
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:51,650
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

504
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,500
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

505
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,956
We never expected how things we got it done?”

506
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:04,476
There’s a very, very big force working:

507
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:08,100
the Force, the Energy

508
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,317
which is the Source of all the energies,

509
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:14,414
which has created this great universe,

510
00:38:14,574 --> 00:38:17,854
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

511
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:21,910
which has created you very delicately.

512
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,710
This Force is working.

513
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,270
And that Force is looking after you,

514
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,949
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

515
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:41,541
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

516
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:46,041
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

517
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,430
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

518
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,190
give us Your lion so we fight.”

519
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:56,580
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

520
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,564
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

521
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:03,093
these horrible conditionings we have.

522
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:06,316
You have to get rid of it.

523
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:10,653
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

524
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:14,230
lots of things, you see. If you see,

525
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,476
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

526
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,284
but they are there.

527
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:27,196
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

528
00:39:27,356 --> 00:39:29,987
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

529
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:36,267
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

530
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:39,933
– like a Goddess. Why not?

531
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:45,550
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

532
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:48,910
So you have all the heritage available to you.

533
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,949
But you have to be worthy,

534
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:57,667
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

535
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:01,280
You have to just know that you are worthy

536
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,920
and that you can do it.

537
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:10,282
So again today we are here to do this puja,

538
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,953
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

539
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:20,505
and is luck for you to have this puja.

540
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:26,216
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

541
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:30,399
very subtler nature.

542
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:35,720
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

543
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,163
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

544
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:41,600
because it’s blood.

545
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,759
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

546
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:51,873
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

547
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,968
another side it is the security.

548
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:59,488
So for you it is the security around you.

549
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,523
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

550
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,836
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

551
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:14,272
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

552
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:16,901
so beautifully you are settled down.

553
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,774
May God bless you.
