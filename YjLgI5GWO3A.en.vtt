00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So much preparation has been done by all you Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:34.942
After seeing that, it feels that the decision to reside in Pune has to have some special reason of love.

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:52.596
There are many reasons but the main reason I feel is the yearning for your immense love is why we decided to make Pune city our home.

00:00:52.596 --> 00:01:15.073
On the whole, getting the land and getting the work done here is certainly a special event.

00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:25.328
But the main reason is that Pune has a mould of immense virtue,

00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:30.446
abundance of good deeds and also has a mould of virtue.

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:34.499
Here people can be transformed into virtuous beings.

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:40.449
But a lot of nuisance has taken place here and will keep happening,

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:47.016
because whenever people are transformed into virtuous beings,

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:55.270
the negative forces are operational everywhere, ready to attack such beings.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.447
Especially at such places where some virtue is being created.

00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:16.122
So, you should achieve Sahaja Yoga more truthfully, with greater alertness and care.

00:02:16.122 --> 00:02:21.107
Pune is the soul of Maharashtra..

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:25.083
It is not  only virtue but it is the soul.

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:30.386
If we infuse vitality(Chaitanya) in this soul

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:33.885
then its good effect will certainly be felt in the whole of Maharashtra.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:37.817
For this purpose I need help from all of you.

00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:46.794
First of all, one should remember that building a house is not really very important and it’s an easy task.

00:02:46.794 --> 00:03:02.307
But with this house if all Sahaja Yogis could be bound together and get  a beautiful form, I will be very happy.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:17.314
This is a very big thing that we all of us have come today for Bhoomi Puja,

00:03:17.314 --> 00:03:19.371
including the saints and sadhus.

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:29.030
We are performing this puja of land and the benefits of this Puja will be felt for ages to come.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:43.651
So today’s special program has a special and an important facet which must be taken care of.

00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:47.482
Sahaj Yoga is sustaining due to your support.

00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:54.161
Yesterday only I told you that we should be prepared to make sacrifices.

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.118
Till now we have seen only the benefits of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:58.118 --> 00:03:59.853
It has all types of benefits.

00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:04.886
Sahaja Yoga has financial benefits, job benefits, health benefits,

00:04:04.886 --> 00:04:09.297
Our relationships with everyone get aligned.

00:04:09.297 --> 00:04:14.058
Marriages take place. Lot of issues get resolved totally.

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:17.474
But the main question is – what  progress have we  made?

00:04:17.474 --> 00:04:21.746
Whatever we have gained from Sahaja Yoga is outwardly.

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:25.334
How much have we gained on the inside – that needs wisdom of sacrifice?

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:29.704
But most of the people discard the wisdom itself.

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:35.394
Therefore, the problem is that if anything is placed before them,

00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:39.899
people first examine what benefit they will derive from it.

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:45.174
Even now there are a lot of Sahaja Yogis who think let us make money,

00:04:45.174 --> 00:04:48.713
or will get this benefit or that benefit.

00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:51.888
If you keep a petty perspective, then everything has to become petty.

00:04:51.888 --> 00:04:58.949
In all, whatever is there and whatever has happened is due to God Almighty and is the work of God.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.863
Therefore, from outside it may seem like we are constructing a home etc. ,

00:05:02.863 --> 00:05:09.926
but symbolically we must understand that we have achieved a great thing here

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:15.864
because Pune will become the global center of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:15.864 --> 00:05:31.795
But, along with it, pretentious people, hypocrites, or such people who come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:40.212
only for their personal interests, say to take advantage for themselves, such people have to be kept under watch and should be kept away.

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:47.783
Gradually, good people irrespective of their number, even with blemishes, will achieve Sahaja Yoga through cleansing.

00:05:47.783 --> 00:05:54.426
But people who are intrinsically bad and come with ulterior motive,

00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:57.329
we cannot do anything with them.

00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:02.283
So it’s better to keep such people out and they are to be told clearly that we cannot do anything for them.

00:06:02.283 --> 00:06:07.190
From now onwards, my stay is going to be here.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.932
I am going to live here only and  the entire  work of Sahaja Yoga is going to take place.

00:06:11.932 --> 00:06:21.173
Only thing I must tell you is that  this house is being built with  my husband’s (Saaheb’s) money and his income.

00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:25.871
And therefore, if he faces any trouble here, he will go somewhere else.

00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:30.130
Sahaja Yogis must keep it in mind that they should not trouble Mataji.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.114
Now everyone (thinks)… “We have come for darshan. “
This is not a temple. This is a live person.

00:06:35.114 --> 00:06:37.680
Everyone insists  …” Let me have a glance.”
They will come anytime.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.638
“I have specially come for darshan. “
The person has reached at six in the morning.
“Hello. What say?”
“I have specifically come for Mataji’s darshan.”

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:49.964
Is Mataji sitting in the temple? To give darshan to each and every one.

00:06:49.964 --> 00:06:51.639
“ But how come everyone gets a darshan when he enters the temple.”

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.122
Then they insist.
“We came with great hope, but you do not give darshan ‘.

00:06:55.122 --> 00:06:57.149
This and that, you are such and such…”

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:03.451
This has to go. This is a very low level thing.

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:08.743
Because we do not understand, what is the work undertaken by Mataji,

00:07:08.743 --> 00:07:12.280
how busy she is in that, what right we have over her?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.283
Everyone feels that he owns every single moment of Mataji.

00:07:18.283 --> 00:07:20.881
Her entire time is ours.

00:07:20.881 --> 00:07:26.730
So we must give our time to Mataji, should not seek her time.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.112
People do not understand this. Anyone and everyone come and stand at the door.

00:07:30.112 --> 00:07:33.233
I feel absolutely restless that they are blocking the door.

00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:35.171
Cannot just step out of the door.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:39.108
So no one should turn up unannounced. The real Sahaja  Yogi will not trouble me.

00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:41.699
This is the first sign.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:47.421
I can’t understand a person who holds my feet and rubs his forehead on them, why is he doing that?

00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:50.043
But he cannot be a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:07:50.043 --> 00:07:55.065
On the contrary, he is a false one who shows off by such an act.

00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:59.452
Second  thing is, that you should not close your eyes when I am there.

00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:02.645
But a lot of people do that. I feel rather surprised.

00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:04.349
What is the need to close your eyes?

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:08.689
Or in my presence also, people bow to the photograph first, and then they bow to me.

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:18.705
So in short, people should be respectful and at the same time should not be pretentious.

00:08:18.705 --> 00:08:20.992
Pretentious people can be identified immediately.

00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:24.440
So don’t give undue importance to hypocrites, pretentious people.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.598
“Because they have very large set up, have a big factory,“

00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:33.261
So what? How does it matter to us?  As they are such big factory owners have they offered you something, given you any help?

00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:36.550
”But they have so much money Mataji. They are like this”.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.572
All humbug. They are simply selfish people.

00:08:38.572 --> 00:08:44.005
Therefore people who seek dharma, who seek the Almighty, only such people should come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:44.005 --> 00:08:46.625
Then it does not matter even if they are only ten.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:49.244
And where is the place in Almighty’s kingdom now?

00:08:49.244 --> 00:08:56.155
Very little place. So how many people to accommodate in that needs to be decided by God.

00:08:56.155 --> 00:09:01.484
To accommodate useless vagabonds, God is not like us. He is very wise.

00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:07.298
He is not ready to entertain useless vagabonds.

00:09:07.298 --> 00:09:10.031
He wants people who are truly genuine.

00:09:10.031 --> 00:09:12.406
All these vagabonds will languish here only.

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:27.527
Hence we should befriend only such people, we should invite such people, we should make friends with people who are genuine seekers God and who aspire to ascend in their spiritual life.

00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:32.209
And I tell you again, one must sacrifice also.

00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:36.556
To sacrifice is very necessary. Once you reach this state, one must sacrifice something or other.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:44.790
Now if I say that let us purchase land at Pashan or some other place then people would say that it is very distant.
0:09:36.556,1193:02:47.295
And in that too, one should not get stuck in small things.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.289
Now this place is quite far off for me.

00:09:46.289 --> 00:09:48.996
I have not even informed Saheb that this place is in the jungle only.

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:52.413
Once the construction is done there, what can poor Saheb say!

00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:55.303
We have never stayed so deep in jungle,

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:58.514
but now if we have acquired land in jungle for you, we will stay here.

00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:06.892
So each one of you should keep in mind that if Mataji is doing so much at this age then why should you look for comforts in each and every thing?

00:10:06.892 --> 00:10:13.133
Sahaja yoga should not be dependence for everyone.

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.600
No dependence at all. Just because there is Sahaja Yoga, there should not be dependence.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.191
“We have come to Sahaja Yoga, so Mataji, do this for us.

00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:25.235
Cure my children, cure my wife, and then cure my complete family.”

00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:29.570
You think, Sahaja Yoga is a charitable hospital or what?

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.449
Therefore, firstly some select few people should understand Sahaja Yoga completely

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:38.192
and once you are knowledgeable, then we can cure everyone.

00:10:38.192 --> 00:10:43.820
Today is such an auspicious day, And also it is Vinayak Chaturthi.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.621
It is a beautiful day. Something very special was mentioned about it.

00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:49.828
Is there a “Panchang” (Indian Calendar)?

00:10:49.828 --> 00:10:53.120
It’s written in the panchang that today is a special occasion.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:01.206
Therefore, today is a very good day and today we have started this auspicious work.

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:06.191
It seems, that our “Vanaprasthashram” (ascetic life) has commenced now.

00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:08.574
These are the elements of  of “Vanaprasthashram (ascetic life).

00:11:08.574 --> 00:11:30.740
(Gap till 24:18. Some Sahaja Yogi must be reading the Panchang and telling Shri Mataji.)

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.034
Sahaja Yogi: Mahargha Punya kaal.

00:11:33.034 --> 00:11:42.563
Mataji: Maharga, you see.

00:11:42.563 --> 00:11:46.458
Just now I told you Maharga Punya Kaal.

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:49.642
Such a great auspicious day. Nothing to beat Maharga.

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:58.120
Argha means, Maharga, Argha. Argha means to offer water, to give argha.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.839
Now you should give water to this land of yours.

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:03.569
You need rain and all arrangements should be done.

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:07.374
But, then you should also   deserve it.

00:12:07.374 --> 00:12:10.200
Whether Sahaja Yogis deserve or not, should be seen.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.257
It will be better if without taking many efforts you achieve Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:14.257 --> 00:12:16.783
And whatever gains you can get, you should take.

00:12:16.783 --> 00:12:20.190
Today is a great day. It is Maharga Punya today.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.052
I had already said earlier.

00:12:22.052 --> 00:12:28.114
So today is a special day. All of you have given me such pleasure and happiness,

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:31.507
you all came here, took so much trouble,

00:12:31.507 --> 00:12:35.776
I request you all with folded hands  to  take similar  efforts for Sahaja Yoga.
