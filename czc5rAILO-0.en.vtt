WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:04.386
We have to seek the eternal.

00:04.601 --> 00:12.581
We have to seek\hthe eternal and the transitory is to be used in moderation

00:12.581 --> 00:18.221
in its own limitation and in its\h
full understanding.

00:18.348 --> 00:26.499
Today's problems of ecology, this, that, all these things come from\hhuman error

00:26.839 --> 00:34.357
and the human error is because they have not found out the eternal.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.400
When you find\hout the eternal, then you become a balanced personality.\h\h

00:42.060 --> 00:45.527
Absolutely a balanced personality.

00:45.885 --> 00:50.267
And\hthe balance comes from Divine wisdom.

00:51.960 --> 01:00.832
All the problems today are because human beings\h
are not at that level of self-knowledge.

01:00.974 --> 01:09.419
Because\hhuman beings are still relatively living.

01:10.067 --> 01:14.222
One person thinks, "This is good".\h
Another thinks, "This is good".

01:14.329 --> 01:19.362
And that's how we\h\hexploit each other, we exploit the nature,

01:19.523 --> 01:22.996
we create\hproblems and everything repels on us,

01:23.229 --> 01:33.128
because transitory things as you know are transitory\h
because they have inbuilt quality to get destroyed.

01:33.780 --> 01:41.903
They get destroyed and gradually\h
we learn from them how to destroy.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.599
But human beings are the epitome of\h
evolution.

01:48.957 --> 01:56.304
God has created human beings as the highest creation.

01:56.988 --> 02:03.855
Maybe we have\hbeen given
freedom, a complete freedom\hto choose.

02:04.354 --> 02:10.080
If we want to go to heaven, we\hcan go.
If we want to go to hell, we can go.\h\h

02:10.620 --> 02:13.956
So, this Freedom we have been acting on,

02:14.045 --> 02:18.988
we can say,\has trial and error
error and trial,

02:19.580 --> 02:29.491
and ultimately, a stage has to reach where we start thinking, \h
"What mistake did we commit?"

02:29.491 --> 02:32.430
"Where did we go wrong?"\h

02:32.430 --> 02:41.579
And there we have to realize that
the eternal, we have not sought.

02:42.707 --> 02:47.194
We see this miracle,
say, of flowers.

02:47.355 --> 02:51.741
We see the flowers how beautiful they are,

02:52.035 --> 02:58.193
created by\hnature.
We can't create even one of them\h\h

02:58.550 --> 03:06.563
Spontaneously, they appear according to\h
the different categories they belong\hto.\h

03:07.440 --> 03:11.293
The choice, such a big choice!

03:11.704 --> 03:19.526
All this and many other such living things are done by this Divine power.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.971
But we take it for granted. We just take\h
it for granted.

03:25.132 --> 03:34.363
And the greatest thing that has happened is that today human beings are brought\h
to this level

03:34.595 --> 03:40.469
that now they have become divine computers.

03:40.948 --> 03:44.310
They can become divine computers.

03:44.453 --> 03:47.586
It’s a very beautiful thing that is ahead of us.

03:47.586 --> 03:54.629
Only thing, we should know that we have to grow into that new awareness.

03:54.861 --> 03:59.788
This is called as the one that we call knowledge.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.584
Knowledge is not mental knowledge, by reading you do not become.

04:04.740 --> 04:12.015
Kabira once said that by reading too much the great learned people have become stupid.

04:12.176 --> 04:14.540
First, I used to think, "How can that be?"

04:14.540 --> 04:17.254
"Pari, pari\hpandita moorakha bhaiye".

04:17.254 --> 04:21.086
I used to think, "By reading, how can people become stupid?"

04:21.406 --> 04:27.975
The thing is, when you read all others are in your head, but you are not there.

04:28.620 --> 04:34.866
And this is, I find today, that we think by reading we’ll become the knowledge.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.951
Knowledge will be, but that’s not an absolute knowledge, that’s not.

04:40.951 --> 04:46.848
That is a relative knowledge to get to the\h\habsolute knowledge you have to become something.

04:47.159 --> 04:49.911
You have to become the Spirit.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.456
And once you become the Spirit, this knowledge is just manifested.

04:55.456 --> 04:58.886
It can be manifested even in a little child.

04:59.104 --> 05:05.191
And a child can know. It’s a subjective knowledge, you can say, but absolute.

05:05.191 --> 05:08.782
It is not arbitrary, it’s collective.

05:08.940 --> 05:14.686
You put ten children who are Realized and ask them, "What’s wrong with this person?"

05:14.847 --> 05:17.978
Immediately they’ll raise the same finger.

05:18.085 --> 05:21.134
This is the thing. Now ask that person,

05:21.402 --> 05:26.302
"Something wrong with your throat? Are you suffering from some trouble?"

05:26.760 --> 05:30.668
He’ll say, “Yes, how do you know?” These children are telling me.\h

05:30.668 --> 05:37.542
So, only the decoding is needed afterwards that, "What’s wrong with you? What finger is burning?

05:37.542 --> 05:41.773
What is the problem and what does it relate to?

05:42.227 --> 05:45.394
You have to just know how to correct it.

05:45.394 --> 05:50.902
And once you know the art of correcting it, you can correct and you can perfect it.

05:51.044 --> 05:53.903
It’s very easy to master this art.

05:54.028 --> 05:57.670
Of course, you must know you can’t pay for anything like this.

05:57.795 --> 06:03.250
How much did we pay\hto the Mother Earth when she sprouted the seeds?

06:03.600 --> 06:07.315
If it’s a living process you don’t pay for anything.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.688
Living processes do not understand money.

06:11.160 --> 06:20.098
How can you pay for these flowers when you have to pay to the Mother Earth?

06:20.224 --> 06:23.401
Of course, you can pay to the florist – that’s a different point.

06:23.401 --> 06:25.744
But to the Mother Earth, you cannot pay.

06:25.851 --> 06:28.562
She does all the job without any payment.

06:28.705 --> 06:34.828
In the same way, this is a living process and you must know that you cannot pay for it.

06:35.078 --> 06:37.939
Anybody who says that “I’m doing God’s work,

06:38.046 --> 06:44.718
I’m doing this work for the emancipation of your soul,” and all that, and takes money,

06:44.737 --> 06:49.732
tell him that he should redeem his own soul first.

06:49.893 --> 06:54.194
You cannot pay for it, you cannot put in the effort also,

06:54.194 --> 06:58.081
because it is a spontaneous thing.

06:58.289 --> 07:02.988
'Sahaja' means: 'saha' with, 'ja' born with you

07:02.988 --> 07:07.889
– is the right of this union with the Divine, is the Yoga.

07:07.889 --> 07:13.148
For this you cannot pay, nor can you command, nor can you demand.

07:13.333 --> 07:20.816
You cannot ask – it just works. So, it’s so simple.

07:20.816 --> 07:24.460
Now some people say, “Mother, how can it be so simple?”

07:24.624 --> 07:27.670
Anything that is vital, isn’t it simple?

07:27.795 --> 07:30.947
As soon as we are born, we know how to breathe.

07:31.072 --> 07:35.274
Who teaches us how to breathe? Automatically we start breathing.

07:35.399 --> 07:40.450
Anything that is important has to be simple, cannot be complicated.
