00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.206
We have to seek the eternal.

00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:16.401
We have to seek&amp;nbsp;the eternal and the transitory is to be used in moderation

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:22.041
in its own limitation and in its&amp;nbsp;
full understanding.

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:30.319
Today's problems of ecology, this, that, all these things come from&amp;nbsp;human error

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:38.177
and the human error is because they have not found out the eternal.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.220
When you find&amp;nbsp;out the eternal, then you become a balanced personality.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.347
Absolutely a balanced personality.

00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:54.087
And&amp;nbsp;the balance comes from Divine wisdom.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:04.652
All the problems today are because human beings&amp;nbsp;
are not at that level of self-knowledge.

00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:13.239
Because&amp;nbsp;human beings are still relatively living.

00:01:13.887 --> 00:01:18.042
One person thinks, "This is good".&amp;nbsp;
Another thinks, "This is good".

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.182
And that's how we&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;exploit each other, we exploit the nature,

00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:26.816
we create&amp;nbsp;problems and everything repels on us,

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:36.948
because transitory things as you know are transitory&amp;nbsp;
because they have inbuilt quality to get destroyed.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.723
They get destroyed and gradually&amp;nbsp;
we learn from them how to destroy.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.419
But human beings are the epitome of&amp;nbsp;
evolution.

00:01:52.777 --> 00:02:00.124
God has created human beings as the highest creation.

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:07.675
Maybe we have&amp;nbsp;been given
freedom, a complete freedom&amp;nbsp;to choose.

00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:13.900
If we want to go to heaven, we&amp;nbsp;can go.
If we want to go to hell, we can go.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.776
So, this Freedom we have been acting on,

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:22.808
we can say,&amp;nbsp;as trial and error
error and trial,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:33.311
and ultimately, a stage has to reach where we start thinking, &amp;nbsp;
"What mistake did we commit?"

00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:36.250
"Where did we go wrong?"&amp;nbsp;

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:45.399
And there we have to realize that
the eternal, we have not sought.

00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:51.014
We see this miracle,
say, of flowers.

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:55.561
We see the flowers how beautiful they are,

00:02:55.855 --> 00:03:02.013
created by&amp;nbsp;nature.
We can't create even one of them&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.383
Spontaneously, they appear according to&amp;nbsp;
the different categories they belong&amp;nbsp;to.&amp;nbsp;

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.113
The choice, such a big choice!

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:23.346
All this and many other such living things are done by this Divine power.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.791
But we take it for granted. We just take&amp;nbsp;
it for granted.

00:03:28.952 --> 00:03:38.183
And the greatest thing that has happened is that today human beings are brought&amp;nbsp;
to this level

00:03:38.415 --> 00:03:44.289
that now they have become divine computers.

00:03:44.768 --> 00:03:48.130
They can become divine computers.

00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:51.406
It’s a very beautiful thing that is ahead of us.

00:03:51.406 --> 00:03:58.449
Only thing, we should know that we have to grow into that new awareness.

00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:03.608
This is called as the one that we call knowledge.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.404
Knowledge is not mental knowledge, by reading you do not become.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.835
Kabira once said that by reading too much the great learned people have become stupid.

00:04:15.996 --> 00:04:18.360
First, I used to think, "How can that be?"

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.074
"Pari, pari&amp;nbsp;pandita moorakha bhaiye".

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:24.906
I used to think, "By reading, how can people become stupid?"

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:31.795
The thing is, when you read all others are in your head, but you are not there.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.686
And this is, I find today, that we think by reading we’ll become the knowledge.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.771
Knowledge will be, but that’s not an absolute knowledge, that’s not.

00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:50.668
That is a relative knowledge to get to the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;absolute knowledge you have to become something.

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.731
You have to become the Spirit.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.276
And once you become the Spirit, this knowledge is just manifested.

00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:02.706
It can be manifested even in a little child.

00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:09.011
And a child can know. It’s a subjective knowledge, you can say, but absolute.

00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:12.602
It is not arbitrary, it’s collective.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.506
You put ten children who are Realized and ask them, "What’s wrong with this person?"

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:21.798
Immediately they’ll raise the same finger.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.954
This is the thing. Now ask that person,

00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:30.122
"Something wrong with your throat? Are you suffering from some trouble?"

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.488
He’ll say, “Yes, how do you know?” These children are telling me.&amp;nbsp;

00:05:34.488 --> 00:05:41.362
So, only the decoding is needed afterwards that, "What’s wrong with you? What finger is burning?

00:05:41.362 --> 00:05:45.593
What is the problem and what does it relate to?

00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:49.214
You have to just know how to correct it.

00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:54.722
And once you know the art of correcting it, you can correct and you can perfect it.

00:05:54.864 --> 00:05:57.723
It’s very easy to master this art.

00:05:57.848 --> 00:06:01.490
Of course, you must know you can’t pay for anything like this.

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:07.070
How much did we pay&amp;nbsp;to the Mother Earth when she sprouted the seeds?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.135
If it’s a living process you don’t pay for anything.

00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:14.508
Living processes do not understand money.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:23.918
How can you pay for these flowers when you have to pay to the Mother Earth?

00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:27.221
Of course, you can pay to the florist – that’s a different point.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.564
But to the Mother Earth, you cannot pay.

00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:32.382
She does all the job without any payment.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:38.648
In the same way, this is a living process and you must know that you cannot pay for it.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.759
Anybody who says that “I’m doing God’s work,

00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:48.538
I’m doing this work for the emancipation of your soul,” and all that, and takes money,

00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:53.552
tell him that he should redeem his own soul first.

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:58.014
You cannot pay for it, you cannot put in the effort also,

00:06:58.014 --> 00:07:01.901
because it is a spontaneous thing.

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:06.808
'Sahaja' means: 'saha' with, 'ja' born with you

00:07:06.808 --> 00:07:11.709
– is the right of this union with the Divine, is the Yoga.

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:16.968
For this you cannot pay, nor can you command, nor can you demand.

00:07:17.153 --> 00:07:24.636
You cannot ask – it just works. So, it’s so simple.

00:07:24.636 --> 00:07:28.280
Now some people say, “Mother, how can it be so simple?”

00:07:28.444 --> 00:07:31.490
Anything that is vital, isn’t it simple?

00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:34.767
As soon as we are born, we know how to breathe.

00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:39.094
Who teaches us how to breathe? Automatically we start breathing.

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:44.270
Anything that is important has to be simple, cannot be complicated.
