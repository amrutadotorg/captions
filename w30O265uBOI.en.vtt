00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:20.139
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

00:12:41.992 --> 00:12:43.890
We have come to this place many a times,

00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:45.858
this beautiful place, you all like it.

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:49.640
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:53.941
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

00:12:54.142 --> 00:12:57.325
you have to spend lot of time.

00:12:58.404 --> 00:13:06.847
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

00:13:07.063 --> 00:13:09.660
and to be with the nature.

00:13:09.861 --> 00:13:18.614
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

00:13:18.815 --> 00:13:22.653
because it is the Sahasrara,

00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:26.026
and it’s very surprising

00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:29.162
that this fruit knows and understands.

00:13:29.363 --> 00:13:34.445
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:37.433
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:41.086
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:45.178
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

00:13:45.378 --> 00:13:48.404
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

00:13:48.605 --> 00:13:51.520
we don’t think what we are doing.

00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:57.901
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

00:13:58.102 --> 00:14:01.532
and it’s so encouraging.

00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:04.833
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

00:14:05.034 --> 00:14:07.891
I congratulate them, all of them.

00:14:08.092 --> 00:14:10.947
Now try to be...

00:14:15.386 --> 00:14:17.431
Try to be kind to each other.

00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:21.132
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.264
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:31.268
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:36.299
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

00:14:36.499 --> 00:14:38.686
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:38.887 --> 00:14:42.508
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:45.034
and you also talk.

00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:50.641
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

00:14:50.842 --> 00:14:55.000
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:57.426
that will make [you] very happy also.

00:14:57.627 --> 00:15:02.114
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:07.495
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

00:15:07.696 --> 00:15:11.110
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:13.066
and they’ll work out many things

00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:16.188
which we could not work out.

00:15:24.362 --> 00:15:30.109
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:34.518
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:49.350
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:51.593
because we are next to the sea here,

00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:55.985
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

00:15:56.185 --> 00:15:58.783
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

00:15:58.984 --> 00:16:06.803
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:14.088
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

00:16:14.288 --> 00:16:23.459
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

00:16:23.668 --> 00:16:28.729
people go and use it for bathrooms.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.394
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:38.066
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

00:16:38.283 --> 00:16:41.049
by which they wear funny dresses

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.495
and lead a very licentious life.

00:16:45.696 --> 00:16:48.406
This is an insult to the sea.

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:53.210
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:57.410
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:03.161
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

00:17:03.362 --> 00:17:07.606
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

00:17:07.807 --> 00:17:11.797
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.673
We cannot be disrespectful.

00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:17.592
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

00:17:17.793 --> 00:17:21.929
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:28.148
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:32.280
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:37.113
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

00:17:37.314 --> 00:17:40.549
Sea is so important to our life.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.901
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

00:17:43.102 --> 00:17:47.882
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:54.127
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

00:17:54.328 --> 00:18:00.407
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

00:18:00.615 --> 00:18:04.823
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

00:18:05.023 --> 00:18:08.712
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

00:18:08.912 --> 00:18:12.764
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:17.269
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.475
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

00:18:21.676 --> 00:18:23.755
it will appear on the other side.

00:18:23.962 --> 00:18:26.104
It always keeps to its maryadas.

00:18:26.304 --> 00:18:30.457
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

00:18:30.657 --> 00:18:32.419
but they keep to their maryadas,

00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:36.144
they never cross their maryadas.

00:18:36.438 --> 00:18:43.745
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

00:18:44.112 --> 00:18:46.732
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

00:18:46.949 --> 00:18:51.730
that it just keeps to its own line.

00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:55.250
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

00:18:55.451 --> 00:18:57.566
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

00:18:57.766 --> 00:19:00.485
it will be just there.

00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:04.263
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

00:19:04.464 --> 00:19:08.951
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:12.477
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

00:19:12.677 --> 00:19:17.476
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

00:19:17.945 --> 00:19:22.944
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

00:19:23.144 --> 00:19:26.209
all the animals that are in it.

00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:30.312
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

00:19:30.513 --> 00:19:35.681
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

00:19:35.882 --> 00:19:38.408
and that’s why it is, we should say,

00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:42.805
the first life came into being in the sea.

00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:46.344
So all our forefathers, long time back,

00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:48.335
must have been born in the sea,

00:19:48.536 --> 00:19:51.290
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:54.324
So we have no right to insult the sea,

00:19:54.525 --> 00:19:57.662
where our forefathers must have existed

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.641
and then they started coming out, one
by one

00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:06.186
as the fish came, as a reptile.

00:20:08.647 --> 00:20:16.646
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

00:20:16.846 --> 00:20:21.683
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

00:20:21.884 --> 00:20:25.517
If the depth of the sea is reduced

00:20:25.717 --> 00:20:33.812
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

00:20:34.012 --> 00:20:37.023
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

00:20:37.224 --> 00:20:41.477
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

00:20:41.678 --> 00:20:43.965
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

00:20:44.165 --> 00:20:46.530
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

00:20:46.731 --> 00:20:51.333
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

00:20:51.534 --> 00:20:54.979
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

00:20:55.179 --> 00:20:57.387
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:57.587 --> 00:20:59.483
deep understanding of ourselves,

00:20:59.684 --> 00:21:01.684
because that’s the sign of dignity.

00:21:01.884 --> 00:21:04.087
And that dignity you must have,

00:21:04.288 --> 00:21:08.496
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

00:21:08.697 --> 00:21:12.653
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

00:21:12.853 --> 00:21:17.673
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.604
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

00:21:20.804 --> 00:21:24.711
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:30.971
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

00:21:31.172 --> 00:21:33.522
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

00:21:33.723 --> 00:21:35.304
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

00:21:35.504 --> 00:21:39.396
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

00:21:39.596 --> 00:21:44.251
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

00:21:44.506 --> 00:21:47.401
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

00:21:47.602 --> 00:21:50.007
from places to places as we have been,

00:21:50.207 --> 00:21:56.425
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

00:21:56.626 --> 00:21:58.948
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

00:21:59.149 --> 00:22:00.893
the whole world can be very rich.

00:22:01.094 --> 00:22:03.223
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

00:22:03.424 --> 00:22:07.027
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

00:22:07.228 --> 00:22:13.381
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

00:22:13.581 --> 00:22:17.475
And lots of wealth which is of…

00:22:17.675 --> 00:22:22.850
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:26.887
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

00:22:27.087 --> 00:22:31.201
and we people will be enriched all over.

00:22:31.972 --> 00:22:34.728
Moreover when we carry the transport,

00:22:34.928 --> 00:22:39.150
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

00:22:39.351 --> 00:22:43.826
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

00:22:44.486 --> 00:22:50.005
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

00:22:50.206 --> 00:22:53.966
It reacts, because if there’s a light

00:22:54.167 --> 00:22:59.351
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

00:22:59.551 --> 00:23:02.418
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:05.284
The sea understands Me very well,

00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:10.610
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:15.603
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

00:23:15.804 --> 00:23:18.173
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

00:23:18.373 --> 00:23:23.676
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.197
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

00:23:29.654 --> 00:23:32.556
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

00:23:32.756 --> 00:23:37.049
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:42.499
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:46.762
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

00:23:46.963 --> 00:23:52.547
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

00:23:52.748 --> 00:23:57.666
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

00:23:57.867 --> 00:24:06.202
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

00:24:06.402 --> 00:24:09.785
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

00:24:09.985 --> 00:24:14.990
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

00:24:15.191 --> 00:24:18.097
In the same way we have to be;

00:24:18.297 --> 00:24:22.006
we have to bear the heat of others,

00:24:22.206 --> 00:24:26.201
the anger of others and create vapours –

00:24:26.402 --> 00:24:29.237
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

00:24:29.437 --> 00:24:31.666
It is with Me, same thing.

00:24:31.867 --> 00:24:35.099
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.821
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:43.581
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

00:24:43.781 --> 00:24:46.026
They just start flowing as vibrations.

00:24:46.226 --> 00:24:48.197
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

00:24:48.398 --> 00:24:50.853
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

00:24:51.054 --> 00:24:53.616
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

00:24:53.817 --> 00:24:57.024
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

00:24:57.225 --> 00:25:03.380
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.309
As you all are here, all these vapours

00:25:06.509 --> 00:25:08.899
as vibrations should flow.

00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:12.810
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.773
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

00:25:15.974 --> 00:25:18.274
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:23.154
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

00:25:23.424 --> 00:25:25.751
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

00:25:25.952 --> 00:25:29.000
Are you afraid to treat someone?

00:25:29.548 --> 00:25:32.249
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:33.843
Why can’t you treat?

00:25:34.044 --> 00:25:37.632
You all can treat them, you can help them,

00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:42.478
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

00:25:42.679 --> 00:25:46.986
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

00:25:47.187 --> 00:25:51.593
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

00:25:51.793 --> 00:25:55.585
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

00:25:55.785 --> 00:26:01.947
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

00:26:02.148 --> 00:26:03.942
Why should God give you vibrations

00:26:04.142 --> 00:26:08.343
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

00:26:08.613 --> 00:26:13.406
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:19.637
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

00:26:20.408 --> 00:26:24.834
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

00:26:25.034 --> 00:26:28.653
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:31.603
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:35.862
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

00:26:36.063 --> 00:26:39.484
if you start using these vibrations.

00:26:40.207 --> 00:26:43.557
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

00:26:43.765 --> 00:26:46.738
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:49.357
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

00:26:49.558 --> 00:26:52.331
because you are not using your vibrations.

00:26:52.532 --> 00:26:56.452
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

00:26:56.653 --> 00:26:59.765
whenever is possible, to help others

00:26:59.973 --> 00:27:03.315
to get all right, to get well.

00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:07.282
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

00:27:07.482 --> 00:27:09.903
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

00:27:10.103 --> 00:27:12.349
but at least use My photograph.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.136
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

00:27:16.337 --> 00:27:22.560
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.191
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

00:27:27.572 --> 00:27:31.746
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

00:27:31.946 --> 00:27:34.835
You have to be seaworthy.

00:27:36.344 --> 00:27:40.693
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

00:27:40.893 --> 00:27:44.266
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:47.168
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:50.471
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.651
“We went there, then this happened,

00:27:52.851 --> 00:27:55.087
then that happened, then this.”

00:27:55.288 --> 00:27:58.292
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

00:27:58.492 --> 00:28:02.120
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

00:28:02.336 --> 00:28:05.327
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

00:28:05.528 --> 00:28:09.566
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

00:28:09.767 --> 00:28:14.022
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

00:28:14.222 --> 00:28:18.948
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

00:28:19.148 --> 00:28:22.864
by which you can save so many.

00:28:23.929 --> 00:28:26.661
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

00:28:26.862 --> 00:28:29.976
that the more you give, the more you get.

00:28:30.177 --> 00:28:34.948
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:41.708
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:45.383
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

00:28:45.584 --> 00:28:48.916
comes back at rivers. In the same way

00:28:49.117 --> 00:28:54.318
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

00:28:54.518 --> 00:28:59.059
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:05.611
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

00:29:05.818 --> 00:29:07.673
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

00:29:07.873 --> 00:29:12.376
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

00:29:12.577 --> 00:29:14.505
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

00:29:14.705 --> 00:29:18.061
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

00:29:18.262 --> 00:29:20.702
that you can vibrate your own water,

00:29:20.902 --> 00:29:22.756
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

00:29:22.957 --> 00:29:25.134
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

00:29:25.335 --> 00:29:29.881
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

00:29:38.008 --> 00:29:42.258
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

00:29:42.459 --> 00:29:45.263
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

00:29:45.464 --> 00:29:47.819
but have faith in yourself.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.713
As the sea has faith in itself,

00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:52.239
you should have complete faith in yourself.

00:29:52.454 --> 00:29:55.426
You must respect your Self Realization.

00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:59.452
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

00:29:59.653 --> 00:30:02.090
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:06.485
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

00:30:06.685 --> 00:30:10.688
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

00:30:10.888 --> 00:30:13.688
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

00:30:13.889 --> 00:30:18.203
I have to try to work it out this way.”

00:30:18.966 --> 00:30:26.584
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:29.772
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

00:30:29.972 --> 00:30:35.445
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

00:30:35.653 --> 00:30:38.430
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

00:30:38.631 --> 00:30:41.069
Nothing else is needed.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.745
May God bless you all.
