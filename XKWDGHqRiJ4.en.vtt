H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Press-Conference

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:36.920
London, England, July 8, 1999

00:00:36.920 --> 00:01:09.120
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:24.980
First of all, it’s important to know what
the truth is.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:33.090
You find so many people are seeking the truth,
but they don’t know what to find and that’s

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.360
how they are twisted around, taken to some
sort of a false rites.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.430
It’s important first of all to know what
is the truth that we are seeking.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:59.690
The truth is, if I tell you, it’s very simple:
that you are not this body, you are not this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:10.970
mind, you are not this intellect, you are
not these emotions, but you are the pure Spirit.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.650
That’s what you have to become – the pure
Spirit.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:28.489
And another truth is that the power that leads
you to the state were you know the truth about

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:36.280
yourself, about everything is within you,
this power is within you, is your own.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.790
Born with you, with every human being.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.329
That’s surprising: if all the human beings
in the whole world have this power within

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.959
their triangular bone - how can we differentiate
them?

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.670
They are all just the same, everybody has
a power based in their triangular bone known

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.500
as sacrum, that means the Greeks knew it was
a sacred bone.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.519
This fact that there is a power in the triangular
bone was known thousands of years back, I

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.799
should say, in India and in various countries.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.670
I was surprised – even in Sweden I found,
Norway I found, people were talking about.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.840
I don’t know how they came to know about.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.219
Specially Moscow I found people who knew about
it.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.079
“How do you know?”

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.109
I asked them.

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.989
They said: “Our forefathers told us”,
like that.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:46.959
Specially with Indian Americans they are very,
very down-to-earth people, very natural people,

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.340
I think – they also knew about it.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.370
And Africans also knew about it.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.709
But they didn’t know how to raise it.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.309
That was the only problem they had.

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:08.079
And though they knew about the centres, about
which just now you have been told, they didn’t

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:14.640
know how to enlighten them through this power
– can you imagine?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.489
This knowledge became – sort of - a knowledge
which people would not accept, because we

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.830
live with science or rationality.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.759
This is something beyond that, but Einstein
has said so, Einstein has said very clearly

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.430
- that there is a torsion area beyond the
mind.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:45.960
And you have to go to that torsion area where
you can get cognitive science – called science,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.270
but I would say, cognitive personality.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.760
So, how is it going to happen to go beyond
the mind?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.240
If you try anything it is through your mind
only.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.400
Whatever you do is through your mind.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.130
So to go beyond your mind is not possible.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.910
Now this power lies in the triangular bone,
which we can see also clearly sometimes in

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.360
some people who have obstruction, where it
cannot rise.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.840
You see the pulsation in the triangular bone
which is just a bone.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.380
But when it rises it is a so smooth movement
of this power.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.180
Now there are some people who have written
that this is a very dangerous thing and this

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.590
happens and that happens, maybe because they
can’t explain, maybe because they don’t

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.300
know anything about it perhaps, maybe they
do not want to know human beings to have it.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:56.400
Now, this power is kept within us because
now our last breakthrough of our evolution

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.440
has to take place.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:06.140
We have to rise to that state which you can
call self-realized or there is 1001 names

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.140
for it.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:15.129
So many people had this power within them
- they felt it also but they were not so much

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.840
capable I think, of raising the Kundalini.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.900
Sufis, you have heard about.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:28.330
Saints, many saints – William Blake, I would
say, from England, there were so many people.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.060
Shakespeare is another one.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.530
They all were realized souls.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:38.789
The way they have expressed themselves shows
very well how detached they were and how beautifully

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.349
they understood the reality.

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:49.090
So when this Kundalini rises as they have
been told, She passes through these six centres.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:56.979
And these six centres are responsible for
our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:57.979
being.

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:08.740
So, when these centres go into jeopardy, some
because of exhaustion, maybe something, then

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.539
it is needed to be nourished and this Kundalini
nourishes them.

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:16.830
Not only It nourishes but It also integrates
them.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.719
So you get your personality in a state where
you are completely integrated.

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:26.300
But then She pierces through your fontanel
bone area.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.870
This is the actualisation of baptism, you
can say.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:37.199
Actually She pierces through and gets you
connected to the all pervading power of Divine

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:38.199
Love.

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.210
It’s all love, nothing else but love.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.990
Truth is love and love is truth.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:50.370
And when She becomes one with that you are
a transformed personality.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.080
Firstly your centres are enlightened.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:01.060
So your health improves, mentally you get
balanced and also emotionally you understand.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:09.930
But the greatest thing that happens to you
is that you become a new personality with

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.289
collective consciousness.

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:14.879
Jung has talked about it – “collective
consciousness”.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:17.819
That you can feel another person.

00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:20.509
You can feel your own centres on your fingertips.

00:08:20.509 --> 00:08:27.060
First you feel the cool breeze in your hand.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:35.029
That is the cool breeze described in the bible
as “the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:38.010
And also in Sanskrit language they call it
“Saleelam, Saleelam”.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.690
In Koran it is described as “Ruh”.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.919
Everywhere it is described with different
names, meaning the same.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:48.290
You start feeling this cool breeze in your
hands, specially on your fingertips and these

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.820
fingertips denote your different chakras as
shown there.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:09:00.430
So, if there is something wrong with your
centres, then it is indicated on your fingertips;

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:06.300
but if it is something wrong with others also
it is indicated because you become, - again

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:12.880
I say, it’s a question of becoming - you
become collectively conscious.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:21.950
But with that you are not disturbed, you are
absolutely at peace with yourself and absolutely

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.950
satisfied.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:28.279
How it happens that our mind is always thinking
about the future, about the past.

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:36.860
And our mind is dancing over the cusp of these
thoughts, which are like this.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:44.130
But when this Kundalini rises She elongates
them and there is a space in between created

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.889
and that space is, what we can say, is the
present.

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:55.149
We can be in the future, we can be in the
past, but we cannot be in the present, and

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:57.980
when you are in the present you are absolutely
thoughtless.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.790
You just become a witness.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:09.850
A witness state comes into you and you start
watching everything, not reacting.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.710
And absorbing everything, very easy.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.070
It’s a very wonderful thing that happens
to you.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:25.350
So this mechanism is placed within you to
give you that special personality, to give

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.600
you that new awareness of collective consciousness,
and the last breakthrough of your evolution.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:40.779
Till human awareness you are alright, till
that I must say they still are there somehow.

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:47.250
But we are afraid of the future of human beings,
because such a turmoil, so many problems,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:54.380
so many kinds of ideas people have, which
is surprising that in these modern times what

00:10:54.380 --> 00:11:02.190
people are thinking: they are something absolutely
primitive, I should say, criminal.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.329
Violence and things, all this has to disappear.

00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:14.050
And I was happy to hear that you all want
transformation, the resurrection.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:21.360
You want transformation, and transformation
on a collective scale.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.820
This is quite possible, absolutely possible.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:32.529
Once you are transformed, you become a person
of tremendous love and patience.

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:35.290
You love everything.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.449
You understand everything through love.

00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:48.120
It’s not love of – some sort of a – expectations,
it’s a love of giving.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:56.490
You just enjoy giving, giving everything is
so enjoyable that time, that state and you

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.490
become so peaceful.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:03.340
Then, as you know, the economics is like that,
people will work very hard to have, say, a

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:10.870
carpet like this and then this is all done,
then they will have some motorcar, then they

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:17.440
want to have a house, I mean, goes on from
one to another, they are never satisfied.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.649
The thing for which you have worked so hard
is finished.

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:26.000
Then again starts a new urge to have something
new.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.410
Goes on like that, the whole economics work
like that.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.881
But here, once I see this carpet, for example
here, I just go into thoughtless awareness.

00:12:34.881 --> 00:12:36.730
And what do I see?

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:46.540
I see the joy, I feel the joy of the person,
of the artist, who makes and enjoy this.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:55.300
Otherwise thinking, I would think how much
it must have cost, where can I buy this, or

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:02.329
if it is mine I would be worried, Oh God,
how I’ve not insured this, which has no

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:03.329
meaning.

00:13:03.329 --> 00:13:07.650
But I cannot enjoy unless and until I become
thoughtlessly aware.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:13.210
Also in our Patanjali Yoga it is written down
as Nirvichara Samadhi.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:20.209
But he has made four stages of the whole thing
is that first is this “Sarvichar”.

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:24.860
Sarvichar means “with thoughts” and then
without thoughts, but in Sahaja Yoga it is

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.910
not so.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:35.850
It is so quick that you become thoughtlessly
aware first, and then you become doubtlessly

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:36.850
aware.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.380
That is there are no doubts about yourself.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:44.810
You know there is a power flowing and you
know by experiment that this power, this power

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.920
can cure people, can help others.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.230
And the attention, which is very high.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:56.769
Like I found people say “I like this, I
want this” - that disappears.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:59.449
Attention goes to others.

00:13:59.449 --> 00:14:08.190
You want to see what others would like, others
would feel, and the whole personality gets

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:14.319
completely enshrined with the feeling of oneness
with others.

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:17.830
It’s something has to happen to all of you.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:27.190
I’m happy I lived in England at least for
20 or 22 years and couldn’t meet you people.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.670
But now, thank God, you people have thought
of it.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.259
Now we live with science and rationality.

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:35.009
This is something beyond that, as I told you.

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:41.230
It is beyond science and rationality which
is accepted as cognitive science, people say.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:46.980
And also as I’ve told you Einstein has talked
about the torsion area.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.779
But how to achieve it, I don’t think he
has written anything about it.

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:59.550
So this is your own power within yourself
for which I don’t have to do anything – they

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.319
might have said it, alright.

00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:02.389
I accept it.

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:05.810
But once it rises in you, it’s like one
candle can enlighten many candles.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:11.949
And that’s how you can spread Sahaja Yoga
very far.

00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:19.600
We have, say, they say so, we are now in 72
countries, possibly.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.540
Because one person gets it, he goes to his
country, starts working.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:29.709
And India, of course, Indians know this very
well, they know they have to achieve only

00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:30.720
this.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:38.370
Like some people told me that we are like
Indian culture.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:46.340
So, we have taken to Indian style of life
and we are very satisfied.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.940
I said “Is that the end?”

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.750
We have so many Indians who are following
that culture.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.339
Are they satisfied people?

00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:56.420
Is that the end?

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.980
What have you to do according to Indian scriptures
also - that you have to know yourself.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.500
You don’t know yourself.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.660
You don’t know what’s wrong with you,
unless and until you can feel your centres

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.230
on your fingertips.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:15.759
You will not know what’s wrong with you
– till you end up with something horrible.

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:21.100
But as soon as you get your Realisation, immediately
you can feel it on your fingertips - your

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.100
problems.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:28.100
Now, supposing you know how to cure it, you
can cure anybody’s and you don’t have

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.160
to pay for it.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.570
See, again and again I’ve said that “it
is your own, it’s your power.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.020
You can’t pay for it.”

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:44.170
I don’t know how people believe that for
spirituality you can pay, it cannot be sold.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.160
In America it was very difficult.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.500
They all came to me and told me: “You have
to sell it”.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.520
I said: “How?”

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.920
They said: “Do something, otherwise nobody
will come to you.”

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.519
I said: “But I cannot do something that
is not done.”

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:03.880
So they said: “Alright, you do one thing:
take money from them and tell them that when

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:09.069
you come for follow-up you will get back your
money.”

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:15.860
So much we are bound by money that if you
have paid the money you think you are bound.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.380
You have to do it.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.130
And absurd things like that human beings think.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.839
But why don’t they think that we have to
change this world?

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:29.060
They have to have emancipation of human being.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.060
Why now?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:36.000
Instead of doing all kinds of other things,
the best thing is to change yourself, transform

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.799
yourself and enjoy.

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:40.360
And enjoyment is complete.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.340
Because enjoyment is singular.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.520
It is not happiness, unhappiness, it’s just
enjoyment.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.640
You enjoy everything.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.430
Even the smallest thing can give you enjoyment.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:18:02.280
And then you don’t start feeling depressed
or doing that kind of a tantrums that you

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.730
do to trouble others, but you are so much
enjoying and everybody enjoys you also, because

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.450
you are so enjoyable.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:15.730
That’s the thing that should happen to human
beings and when it happens it’s something

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:21.680
really very, very great and that should happen
to all of you.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.490
And I’ll be very happy, I was told you are
all very great dignitaries here and you can

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:37.760
do a lot and this is how we have a chance
of first of all getting your Self Realisation.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.400
Knowing your Self.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.919
And then helping people.

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:47.059
With a genuine love and affection.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:53.043
I don’t know how much I should talk because
we’ve had so many lectures after lectures

00:18:53.043 --> 00:18:54.510
and there’s no end to it.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.630
But lecturing doesn’t help – it is something
else to work out within yourself.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.780
That is the most important thing.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.980
Now, I would like also to have some questions
from you.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:12.860
If you have gone thoughtless I can’t help
it.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:21.669
Question: Have you overcome all the fears
of life?

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:28.520
You are not afraid of death also?

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:37.780
Shri Mataji: I don’t know that part, but
definitely I knew that I have to find out

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:45.590
a way and method by which I could give en-masse
realisation.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.929
Because people used to give realisation, no
doubt, but one person used to give to one

00:19:49.929 --> 00:19:50.929
person.

00:19:50.929 --> 00:19:53.696
One of the reasons maybe because anybody who
was saintly, people used to torture them,

00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:54.696
trouble them.

00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:55.696
They wouldn’t like a person like that because
that person was something – out of the blue,

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:56.696
you can call it.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:20:01.340
So that was an attitude towards a person who
was a realised soul.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:11.409
Everybody suffered, whether they were Sufis
or they were – otherwise even William Blake,

00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:19.220
I mean, everyone whosoever said something
different, people didn’t like.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:25.950
So maybe that’s the reason they used to
give it to one person.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.080
That was the tradition.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.390
Realisation was such that out of thousands
they used to select one person, work on him,

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.210
cleanse him, do this, do that and then give
realisation.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.429
One person.

00:20:38.429 --> 00:20:45.059
But I felt that the time has come that you
must give en-masse realisation.

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:51.220
Unless and until people get en-masse realisation,
we cannot change this world.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.910
And I worked, I should say, for days together.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:21:00.450
Luckily my father was a very social personality,
even my husband was.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.380
So I had a good chance to meet people.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:10.510
In my own subtle ways I used to find out what
is the permutation and combination of problems

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.580
inside the human beings and then how to work
it out.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:20.010
That’s the only thing I did more, I think,
otherwise so many people used to give Self

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.049
Realisation at different times.

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:27.710
But what I found out a method by which thousands
of people can get realisation.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.180
Question: How did you come upon this method?

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.640
Shri Mataji: Just, you see, I discovered it.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:43.410
You see, it’s a thing I worked it out.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:54.770
Have all gone thoughtless, or what?

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.559
Yes, madam?

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:12.299
Question: When you depart from this body,
as this lady was asking, where does the spirit,

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:14.570
where do the energy stay?

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:20.700
Shri Mataji: Spirit – it’s a very long
answer, but I would say, Spirit goes according

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.400
to its desire, alright.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:32.690
Now, supposing there is a drunkard, who dies,
now he wants to drink still, even if he’s

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.690
dead.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:40.830
He will hang in somewhere in the limbo, I
think, he will get hold of somebody who drinks

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.470
a lot.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:49.779
This side of psychology, people don’t understand
in the west.

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:52.909
Because it’s nothing in the medicine about
this.

00:22:52.909 --> 00:23:00.059
The other day I read a very nice article about
it, was published in America.

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:04.540
That Japanese believe that you get possessed
by a spirit.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.850
Even in the bible it is so that you get possessed
by the spirit.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:16.270
But they have said that 50 to 60% people get
possessed.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.690
Schizophrenia, all kinds of psychological
problems come from that.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.840
Now, in India also we believe in it.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:32.350
And if you can remove the possession of a
person the person completely changes, no doubt.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:37.230
But this is still in the realm of science,
you cannot get it.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:43.179
I mean, I would say that, psychology is still
a childish science and in that realm they

00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:46.640
don’t understand what is this possession.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:54.049
Is a fact that so far they have not gone into
it, but we know in Sahaja Yoga very clearly,

00:23:54.049 --> 00:24:02.950
because we get catches on the left hand side,
say here on this thumb, that means a person

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:03.950
is possessed.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.340
Yes, it’s like that, it’s so simple.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.440
And then you can cure that person.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.299
So many persons have been cured.

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:14.460
So many.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:23.309
Who have given up as lunatics, or schizophrenic
or all kinds have been cured, no doubt.

00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:29.210
But it is to be seen and to be worked out,
then you can believe it.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.970
Because people don’t believe that there
is such a thing.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.650
But there is.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.529
There is some sort of a negative force which
overpowers human beings, it is true.

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:42.520
I must tell you the truth.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:55.700
We have had so many cases, even in England,
where people were possessed.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.750
So many cases.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:05.210
On the contrary I would say that cancer and
all psychosomatic troubles come to people

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.780
when they shift to the left side.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.760
Means to the past.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:16.350
Maybe some viruses which are dead long time
back are in our being – that everything

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.210
is past is in our being.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.640
So they can attack.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.770
And I’ve told them long time back somehow
through this cognitive knowledge that they

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:30.242
will call by 53 proteins and 63 progenides
[ ? UNCLEAR] I told them.

00:25:30.242 --> 00:25:34.620
And now they know it is so.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:39.370
So cancer is curable in Sahaja Yoga, we have
cured cancers, of many people.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.900
Absolutely curable.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:47.840
We have an hospital in India, already established
near Bombay.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.289
There’s a nice hospital where people are
cured.

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:56.289
And we don’t charge them for any treatment,
only for the stay.

00:25:56.289 --> 00:26:05.940
It’s a fact, you see, because people never
talk about it, they never told you.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:10.640
So you think it’s a, some sort of a mythological
thing, it’s not.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:17.740
It is there, it exists.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.149
So many diseases are not cured because we
don’t know about them.

00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:30.190
You see, I was myself in a medical school,
so I know that they know very limited things.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.320
Beyond that, they don’t know.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320
But in Japan, I was surprised that they believe
in it and they treat people.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:40.330
Even in India, I mean, they know.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:52.039
Question: What do you give, provide the definition
of enlightenment?

00:26:52.039 --> 00:27:05.789
Shri Mataji: Enlightened means a personality,
enlightened personality, I can tell you, is

00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:12.289
a person who is beyond his mind.

00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:19.539
And he is in contact completely with this
all-pervading power of divine love.

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:28.110
As a result everything in that person is guided,
helped by that divine love.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:39.140
That power is so great that it looks after
you, it organizes everything, it thinks, it

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.770
understands, it is wisdom of all the things.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:50.270
You become a person who is so collectively
conscious.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.049
Today we need people like that.

00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:56.390
Otherwise you always think about yourself.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:04.630
About others you can only think when you are
collectively conscious.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:10.049
But these days there are so many people marketing
their spirituality, you see.

00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:11.919
That’s also there.

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:14.620
And just people jump to it, I don’t know
why.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:24.399
Why don’t they find out what is the gain,
what did you gain out of it?

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:31.029
Nobody wants to know.

00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:52.510
Question: How did you find America?

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.380
Shri Mataji: They are antipodes.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.769
I don’t know what to say, they are very
money-oriented, extremely money-oriented.

00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:06.950
And they can’t understand me because I’m
not asking for money, you see, they can’t

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.950
understand.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.950
It’s very difficult.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:13.120
And how to penetrate that veil of theirs?

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:22.789
So, this time it has been much better, I should
say, I’ve been there.

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:28.380
I went first, long time back, 1973 I went
there, and I saw the people how mad they were.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.790
After one boy was a 16 years old guru, you
see.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.269
They just giving money to him.

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:39.000
So, I asked him “Why they are giving money?”

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.539
What is the need to give money like this?

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:41.539
To this guru?

00:29:41.539 --> 00:29:43.890
They said: “Because he is giving us spirit.”

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.179
Where is he giving you spirit?

00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:54.010
And then this fellow, he was wiser than others
I should say, because he settled down as a

00:29:54.010 --> 00:30:00.649
young one, he married some American lady and
used his money, but all the rest of them,

00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:09.470
so many of them, went there to befool them.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.440
It’s endless.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.380
Still going on.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:28.370
But unless and until you accept the truth,
you cannot change.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.030
Accept us in the sense you have to ask for
it.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.030
You should have pure desire.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:40.070
This Kundalini is the power of pure desire
within you.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.140
When She rises She gives you your pure desire.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.140
Not like this, changing from one to another.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.980
And if you have pure desire only then it works
out.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:31:04.919
If you don’t have, it won’t work out - no.

00:31:04.919 --> 00:31:07.690
I cannot force it.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:17.790
Cannot be forced, you see.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:23.360
Question: How are children, young children?

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.549
Shri Mataji: Oh, some of them are great.

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:29.690
These days so many realised souls have been
born, these state [or these days?

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.120
UNCLEAR] . We don’t understand them.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.600
But there are so many, even in England there
are born so many of them.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:46.080
Born realized – they are special ones.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.940
I mean, this fact, it happens, so many good
things happen to the society, like drug addiction,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:59.450
over night people in this England gave up
drugs, over night.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:08.679
I’ve got one land far away from madding
crowd, I should say, in upstate New York,

00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:16.419
and I wanted to start a curative centre for
drug addicts, because that is one of the big

00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:18.210
problems here.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.649
But they said the public won’t allow.

00:32:20.649 --> 00:32:21.799
I said: “Why?”

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:23.730
They said: “They go amok.”

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:30.950
This place is so far fetched, you cannot give
a walk all the way – and if, I mean, they

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:33.830
allow me I could help a lot.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:37.360
But somehow, even in Italy, is difficult.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:44.630
And the biggest problem today, even in America,
is drug addiction.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:48.230
Another you can call AIDS.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:54.600
We tried AIDS also, but AIDS-people are something
wrong with them, they are extremely arrogant.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:59.500
Quarrelsome, arrogant, they think they are
martyrs - something like that.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:04.270
We’ve tried, we’ve helped one or two – no
doubt.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.270
But it’s very difficult.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.740
But these drug addicts can’t be helped very
easily.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:13.510
But there is no proper way, if you all can
arrange something - I would like to.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:20.019
In your, this London city only, I should say,
at least 10 or 11 people like that.

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:21.670
First time I talked they’ve got cured.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:29.890
They were all doing very well, were very well
educated.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:35.330
All these problems can be solved.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:39.889
But the government should help, in a way.

00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:46.070
Because you know they, so much time even to
take permission for something.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:52.399
Sometimes like 10 years, 20 years, you go
on applying.

00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:56.289
I am already very old and I don’t know what
will happen, if I go on like this.

00:33:56.289 --> 00:33:58.679
For 20 years for a permission.

00:33:58.679 --> 00:33:59.840
Very difficult.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:08.000
But you people can organize something like
that.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.460
And I can work it out.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:21.680
You can see the results.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.120
You can see the results, you can save these
children.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.120
Alcoholism, alcoholism also can be corrected.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.120
Yes, please?

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.120
Question: Shri Mataji, would you say a few
words about the golden age?

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.910
The forthcoming golden age?

00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:45.571
Shri Mataji: You see, Aquarius, as they say,
Aquarius according to our astrology is the

00:34:45.571 --> 00:34:46.571
Kundalini.

00:34:46.571 --> 00:34:54.840
The Kundalini is Aquarius according to Indian,
I should say, Indian science of (HINDI word

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.460
– Sir C.P. explains:)

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.460
Astrology.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:07.240
And, you see, they, what they say that this
age of Aquarius is very important, because

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.060
this will change the lives of people.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:19.890
And that is what they have already described
about this, that now there was Kali Yuga,

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.190
means the worst possible times.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:30.960
The whole Kali Yuga means the absolutely the
worst and worst possible time for our destruction.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.240
That was over.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:38.540
Then comes Kruta Yuga, I mean, overlapping.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:46.320
Now, in Kruta Yuga, this all-pervading power,
they call it Paramchaitanya, becomes active.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.570
It starts helping people to come along.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.680
That also has been going on some days.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.020
After this, is Satya Yuga.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.680
It’s the age of truth.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.250
But it’s a last judgement.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.920
If you take to truth, alright, well and good.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.800
But if you don’t take to truth you are judged.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800
It’s like this.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.950
Now how many people take to truth, very surprising.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.880
Like a place like Russia, you’ll be amazed
- Russia.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.530
Country like Russia.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:25.370
I went there and I first time went to Saint
Petersburg, that’s Leningrad that time.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:37.460
And when I went to the hall I saw about 2000
people sitting outside.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:46.930
Because there you have to pay for a hall,
I mean, the hall people.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.700
So, 2000 seats were all occupied inside.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.460
So these people outside, people said: “Maa,
are you not going to give us realisation?”

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:59.550
I said: “How do they know all this?”

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.550
Somebody must have told them.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:06.650
When I went in I said: “Alright, wait, I’ll
come back then I’ll give you Realisation.”

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.980
So, I went inside.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:15.960
Inside there were 2000 people nicely sitting
down, listening to me and then they got their

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960
realisation.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960
All of them.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.960
I was amazed.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.960
What’s the matter?

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.310
How is it they’re working so fast?

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:29.730
And then I came out and I saw there were again
these 2000 still sitting there.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.970
45 minutes they were still.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:36.890
I said: “Alright, you all come tomorrow
morning, we’ll sit outside.”

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:41.790
Now, in Moscow they have huge big places,
huge big compounds and buildings.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:48.310
I said: “I’ll sit on the steps and I’ll
try to give you realisation.”

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:53.900
You won’t believe – 2000 from inside,
2000 from outside and one thousand extra,

00:37:53.900 --> 00:38:00.570
I mean, 5000 people gathered there next morning
and they all got their realisation.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:06.690
In Moscow, you won’t believe how many people,
if somebody asks me, I cannot say, have got

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.690
realisation.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:11.440
Now, the reason, I reasoned it out what must
be the reason.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.030
I asked them: “How is it?

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.020
Had you advertised that much?”

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:22.200
“No”, they said, “we saw your photograph.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.400
We knew.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.590
We came.”

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.990
So sensitive, I say.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:32.050
And thousands and thousands have got realisation.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:38.200
These people are so deep, so deep, so humble.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:49.040
I couldn’t understand why, why are they
so much spiritually endowed, how did they

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.310
get all this.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:58.680
And what I found is that communism has given
them no freedom of any kind.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:06.380
And as a result, I think, they got completely
oppressed and the whole thing growth was inside.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:15.700
And also if you have read those great novelist,
even Tolstoi, or anyone - they always show

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:25.700
introspection, even by the hero or by the
villain, anybody, they all introspect.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:31.770
And this is the one, I thought, is the very
deep personalities they develop.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:35.590
And immediately they got it.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.350
A far fetched place called Togliatti where
they make motorcars, thousands and thousands

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:45.470
– we could not get to any hall, because
formerly, I mean, normally what was the thing

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:57.262
we were taken, we would have to take a stadium
– 18 to 20.000 in Moscow or Leningrad or

00:39:57.262 --> 00:39:58.930
a big city.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.410
But in Togliatti we didn’t know what to
do.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.850
So we just had it in the open.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:03.850
Thousands and thousands.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.000
But not in England – no.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.080
Much worse is America.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.150
I don’t know why.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.770
Even Indians in England are no good.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:16.910
I just don’t know what happens to them.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:30.640
They are neither English nor Indian, I think,
something is, but we have very few Indians

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.390
even, I must tell you this, very frankly.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:42.060
But in India we have so many, so thousands
and thousands who have got realisation.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:49.420
Though Indians know they have to have self
realisation, even here.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:54.220
But somehow they are fed up, I don’t know
of what.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:59.880
Even if you read Shakespeare you feel like
understanding that he was a great realised

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.880
soul.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:08.570
What he showed was the futility of human endeavour
in every line, it’s clearly shown.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.150
That’s what he was.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:20.550
I can’t understand, see, because I’ve
read so much Indian novels and English novels

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.810
and English writers.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.430
I find all of them are so enlightened.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.780
Can’t understand what’s happening in England
now.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.780
Why?

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:41.850
Now, 20 years I’ve been in England, first
time I’m meeting people like you.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.430
Why?

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:51.370
I would ask you, people.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:57.730
Really, I can’t understand.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.570
Even Austria, you have thousands.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:05.050
Italy, where Roman Catholics you know, are
so many.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:06.980
Italians, wonderful.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:07.980
Thousands.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:15.220
But I didn’t live so long there as I‘ve
lived in England.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.340
Moreover, you see, language-wise, I know this
language, though I never studied English,

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.790
but I know English language, how to speak.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:35.410
But there in their language, it’s Italian
or, I don’t know how.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:44.460
I’m very happy today that you all have come
and I hope now from you it will start going

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.140
into other people.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:54.050
Because it’s very important: we have to
change this world.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:58.270
And, I would say, they also said, some newspaper
people have come, but I said: “I’m sorry,

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:01.650
I don’t know what they will think of me.”

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.550
Because they have never been very supportive.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:08.270
But I think they don’t realise their responsibility.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:09.270
Really!

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:17.330
Sometimes I see newspapers, I think they don’t
realise how much they are harming people by

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.580
wrong directions.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.760
By sensational things.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:27.610
What they have to do is to see what will be
the effect of these things that we are writing.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:35.590
Is it going to help them to rise above all
these things like jealousies and violence

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:43.040
and all these things that are really completely
corroding our humanity.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:52.460
So, I think, all those lines, I don’t find
them and by head, I would say, I’ve met

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:54.200
some of them, they were just after me.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.970
“How is it you are in England?”

00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:00.540
I said: “Because my husband has a job here,
that’s how I’ve come.”

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.780
Then all kinds of funny, funny questions they
were asking.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:09.500
You know, I was surprised, they are not interested
in spirituality at all.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:21.030
So, then, whenever they said “Mother, somebody
is coming from there” I said: “Now - please.”

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:23.750
All kinds of things they would say.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:27.760
“Your country is so poor, what are you doing
here?”

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.730
Then I had to tell them why we are poor.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:40.130
I said: “300 years if you have a guest in
your house without a visa what will happen

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:41.750
to you?”

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:53.030
Then another question: “Why you have got
so many, such a big population, so many children

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.030
born?”

00:44:54.030 --> 00:45:01.590
I said: “In that also, I would say, that
what I have read about England is this, that

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.730
so many children are killed every week, by
the parents even.”

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:13.620
I said: “So, the children must be deciding
to be born in a poor country than in a country

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.340
where they can be killed.”

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.600
I mean, simple thing like that.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.500
Because children want love, they don’t understand
anything else.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.850
So like that they asked me funny, funny questions.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:33.220
I said: “I am here for spirituality, talking
to about spirituality, and why should I worry

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:39.710
about what I am, what is this and what is
that?”

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:44.680
Say, we have to change our attitude.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.560
Very important.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.090
Of course I know some people who are very
broad, broad minded attitude towards people,

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.140
very much.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:57.740
I’ve known some in India also, but there
are so few.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:04.280
If this thing has to be done it has to be
mass-scale.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:10.770
Now, we have Sahaja Yogis, many Sahaja Yogis,
I should say, but still I’m not satisfied.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:16.860
I think we need many more.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:17.880
Hindustani…

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.900
HINDI…

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:32.860
I don’t know why.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:44.580
Such a big tradition you have in our country.

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:51.950
Instead of bringing that here to this country,
I don’t know what’s happening.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.160
And they are also very, very spiritual people.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:01.920
There too, you read their books you see, you’ll
be amazed.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.150
Very spiritual.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:09.910
But suddenly the whole thing has turned round,
I think so that spirituality has lost its

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:10.910
power.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:17.100
And maybe some, you imported some of the horrible
gurus from there also might be.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:25.330
That might be another reason, I think so.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:30.260
But now, I think, they are very much reduced
in number, there are few still going round,

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.280
making money, doesn’t matter.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:37.580
But now you people are very sensible, very
highly placed, you should do something about

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:41.220
it, my request is.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:50.320
I’m available and never used to say, whatever
you say.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.360
It’s a new mission where you have to do
something.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:48:23.200
You are the ones who are going to completely
revolutionize the whole world.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.200
You can do it.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.760
Absolutely everybody is capable of doing that.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.530
Question: Another question: What’s your
opinion of Avataras?

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.970
Shri Mataji: Alright, what’s the use of
my opinion about it?

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.080
There are Avataras, no doubt.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.080
Alright?

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.290
But you don’t believe me when I say that.

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.340
Unless and until you experience you shouldn’t
believe even me.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.440
Alright, this is something and because you
asked me I’m saying so.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.550
But I don’t say you believe in some Avataras,
first of all you experience them.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:54.700
Everything that is now – you will know gradually
into different things and on every centre

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.700
there is somebody sitting there.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.700
Who are they and what work they do?

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:07.500
All this is to be consumed and to be seen
and to be experimented.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:12.480
Now, I say, supposing this centre is catching
…. [UNCLEAR] it is the centre very important

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.860
because it is in the optic chiasma like this,
you see, it’s constricted.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:22.460
Now, how to open this?

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.900
Very difficult.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.050
Now, I say, you forgive everybody.

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:32.040
You forgive everybody – it opens.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.410
Why?

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:37.830
Because Christ, Christ is on that centre.

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.030
And his message is to forgive.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:49.010
Is, I mean, you should know who is on which
centre and what works out.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:52.380
That’s only to be known.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:57.970
Once you get your Self Realisation, only you
have to know this much, who is the one responsible

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:59.950
for which chakras.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.260
That’s all.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:09.080
And you, you have to do according to – like
it’s a mantra now, to say that “I forgive

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.080
everyone”.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:14.130
Now, some people would say it’s very difficult
to forgive.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.720
But logically: if you forgive or don’t forgive
– what are you doing?

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.920
You don’t do anything.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.200
But if you don’t forgive then you torture
yourself.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.190
That’s why you forgive everyone.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.580
And this opens.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:34.370
Most constricted – it opens like this.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:40.760
Question: So, which God is for the Kundalini?

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.880
Christ is over here.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.650
Which God is in the Kundalini?

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:44.650
In the triangle?

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:50.150
Sahaja Yogi: What is the God or the deity
in the triangular bone, the Kundalini?

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.100
Shri Mataji: Kundalini itself.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:57.540
The Kundalini is your own mother.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.770
Your individual mother.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:05.910
And She has tape-recorded all your past and
your aspirations, everything.

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:15.000
And She rises because She wants to give you
your second birth, but She is your individual

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
mother.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.281
You don’t share Her with anybody else.

00:51:18.281 --> 00:51:23.090
Yours is a different, somebody else’s is
different.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.160
Because the tape-recording is different.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.160
And She knows everything about you.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:34.020
So, when She rises She does, goes very slowly,
without harming you, without troubling you

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:40.530
and pierces through.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:56.760
We say She is the reflection of the Adi Shakti
who is called as Holy Ghost in the bible.

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:03.650
But She rises without any difficulty.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.160
Hardly any time it takes.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.530
Would they like to have their Self Realisation?

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:13.270
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji asks if you would
like to experience this and have your Self

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.270
Realisation?

00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:16.290
Very quick, very easy.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:19.310
Shri Mataji: Hardly any time.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.590
Now, you forget the past.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:26.770
Another thing you have to do is to forgive
yourself.

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:27.770
And not to feel guilty about anything.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:39.760
Very important, because if you feel guilty
then this centre catches here on the left.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:46.910
When it catches here on the left you can get
spondylitis, you can also get angina.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:49.290
So why, why to feel guilty?

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:52.690
Whatever has happened has happened, forget
everything.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:55.350
Not to feel guilty – very important.

00:52:55.350 --> 00:53:00.500
I know here people feel more guilty, not in
India.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:05.880
They never feel guilty.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.360
But in the west they do.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.590
But there’s no need, no need to condemn
yourself, you have to have great honour and

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:25.670
love for yourself, because you are special
people and that you are going to help the

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:28.580
whole world.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.960
So respect yourself!

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:43.170
As I respect you and love you.

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:51.920
You, please, respect and love yourself.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.380
Alright.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:54:02.550
Now, what you have to do is to put both the
hands towards me, like this, just like this,

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:07.740
because I told you these are the endings of
the sympathetic nervous system.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:15.330
It’s like this – little open, like this.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:23.620
You don’t have to doubt yourself, by any
chance.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.420
Please, don’t doubt.

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:38.920
Now, you put your left hand like this towards
me and right hand on top of your head here.

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:45.550
On top, means away, not touching the head.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:53.020
You can bend your head and see for yourself.

00:54:53.020 --> 00:55:01.920
Now see, if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area which

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.380
was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:13.630
Just see for yourself, if there’s a hot
or a cool breeze-like vibrations coming out

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:20.380
of your fontanel bone area which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:25.140
Now, you can move your hand and see for yourself.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:31.990
You can move it, sometimes you can feel it
higher, sometimes lower or on the sides.

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.990
See for yourself.

00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:37.050
If it is hot that means, of course, you have
got your Realisation, but if it is hot that

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:39.400
means you have not forgiven yourself.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.890
Or you have not forgiven others.

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:54.670
So, please forgive others, also forgive yourself
fully.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:57.360
Please forgive.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:12.190
Now, please put your right hand towards me,
bend your head.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:24.820
And see for yourself if you have cool or hot
breeze-like vibrations coming out of your

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:35.310
fontanel bone area which was the soft bone
in your childhood.

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:40.370
Please try.

00:56:40.370 --> 00:57:00.610
Please bend your head and see for yourself.

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:09.940
Now, please take down your hands, both hands
and put them towards me, like this.

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:13.340
And don’t think.

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:18.290
Just don’t think.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:32.230
Because I already told you, you have a right,
it’s your birthright to have this Yoga,

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.210
union with the divine, it’s your birthright.

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:54.320
Now, you have to put both your hands towards
the sky like this and push back your head

00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:06.120
and ask me – I’ll tell you about three,
three things, three questions you can say.

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:10.500
You have to say one question three times,
only one of them.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:20.090
For example you can ask, you can call me Mother,
Mother – or Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:24.950
Mother is, is this the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost?

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:30.840
Ask in your heart this question “Mother
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.840
Ask three times.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:38.570
Or, you can ask “Mother, is this the all-pervading
power of divine love?”

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:45.730
Or you can ask third question “Mother, is
this the Paramachaitanya or Ruh?”

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:52.760
Ask anyone of these questions, anyone of them,
three times.

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.850
Now - let’s have it.

00:58:56.850 --> 00:59:06.040
Alright, please put down your hands again
and put them towards me.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:10.600
Please, don’t doubt, please don’t doubt.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.950
That’s something very important.

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:25.340
If you start feeling a cool or a hot breeze
on your fingertips or on your palm, same or

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:35.460
out of your fontanel bone area, out of your
head, anyone of them, then raise your both

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:40.200
the hands, raise your both the hands – those
who have felt it that way.

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:57.770
Those who have felt the cool breeze in their
hands.

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:23.210
Thank you very much!

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:43.720
Most of you have got it.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.720
Unbelievable…

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.590
You got it?

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:50.500
No – not yet?

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.500
Alright.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.550
Who didn’t get it now?

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:55.550
She also.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:56.550
You didn’t get it, madam?

01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:57.550
You got it?

01:00:57.550 --> 01:01:00.020
They can help you, let us see.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.190
You got it?

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:05.810
You felt the cool breeze?

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:10.950
Now – you felt it.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:19.350
Keep it like that.

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:35.780
Let it flow as much as possible, is very good.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:42.740
You all can do this, it’s very simple.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.910
She has it now?

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:47.930
Sahaja Yogi: It’s warm, Mother, it’s warm.

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:49.660
Shri Mataji: It’s warm?

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:58.500
Alright, put her left to the right.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:08.890
Raise her left.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:22.740
What’s she catching on?

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:46.970
Sahaja Yogi: It’s left Vishuddhi, Shri Mataji.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:57.360
Shri Mataji: Left….

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:07.750
Are you Bengali?

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:28.520
Seeker: I am from the Caribbean.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:52.760
Shri Mataji: Now you just don’t think.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:04:01.330
That’s what you should practice a little
bit.

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:07.280
Put your hands towards me, all of you and
don’t think.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.110
What is it?

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:11.890
Did you feel the Kundalini?

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:15.870
Are you feeling it on the head?

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:22.260
Warm, so that’s it – put her left to the
right.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.650
Raise her left and put down the right.

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:28.900
It has nothing to do with the air-condition.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.670
You feel it on your fingers – alright?

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:32.670
Now better?

01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:33.670
Now alright?

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:34.730
May God bless you!

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.020
Just keep go on like that.

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020
Alright?

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020
Are you feeling?

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.020
Cool or hot?

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020
Cool now?

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020
Now she’s got it.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020
So, thank you very much!

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.020
Thank you, all of you!

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.020
May God bless you! (quietly)

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.410
You have to practice now.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:05:59.290
Can you not tell them to come to some follow-up
or some program like that?
