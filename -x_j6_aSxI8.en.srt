1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,560
My joy knows no bounds

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:21,920
when we have come to worship this holy mountain,

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,880
which we have named as Ganaraj.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,360
Sometimes the words are not sufficient

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,720
to hold the outpour of your joy.

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,960
I come to you as a symbol of your Mother,

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,160
but the first son who was created was Shri Ganesha.

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,600
And then, when the Mother Earth was created

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
as a symbol of motherhood,

10
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,120
She created many Shri Ganeshas in this universe.

11
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:30,400
In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars, is the Ganesh,

12
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,560
All these symbols were created for you the Sahaja Yogis

13
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,960
to recognize them;

14
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,560
to recognize all these symbols is easier

15
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,640
if you are a realized soul.

16
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,640
But we have had

17
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,200
so many great realized souls in the past,

18
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,800
of very high quality,

19
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,080
and they recognized,

20
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,760
they found out the symbols of Shri Ganesha long time back.

21
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,200
India is the microscopic form of the whole earth, Mother Earth.

22
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,840
So, in the triangle of Maharashtra we have got eight Ganeshas

23
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,400
which are manifesting vibrations,

24
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,720
and were recognized by great Saints of Maharashtra.

25
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,960
But, as you have seen, as a grace of these great Saints,

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,560
specially Maharashtra has created human beings

27
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,040
who have shraddha

28
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,920
as the highest expression of their emotion and mind.

29
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,400
Because of that lofty vision in the mind,

30
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,600
whenever they see something of this sublime nature,

31
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,560
their thoughts go to God.

32
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,160
Thanks to the Saints of that state

33
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:48,440
that people have that sensitivity and that kind of a movement.

34
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,080
Today, in the Presence of Shri Ganesha,

35
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,240
you have to take an oath that,

36
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,040
"Whatever is the past of my country,

37
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,560
I will get opposite to that."

38
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,880
Like I would say Indians are not very good with the money;

39
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,360
money matters they can be very horrid,

40
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,280
and sometimes they create a problem with money matters.

41
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,520
So, one has to know that we have to be absolutely astute

42
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,600
as far as money is concerned.

43
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,640
It is not sufficient only to be something innocent,

44
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,800
but it is more that it should be proved,

45
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,320
that people should know that you are innocent!

46
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Like I asked My son-in law, he is a very honest man,

47
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,240
whether this would be honesty,

48
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,040
so he answered, "This may be honesty for outside purpose,

49
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,840
but it is not in the essence of honesty."

50
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,920
So, that is how you have to be honest, in the essence of it,

51
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,920
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

52
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,920
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

53
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,880
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

54
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,720
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

55
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,400
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

56
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,800
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

57
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,200
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

58
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,000
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

59
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

60
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,560
That is the sign of your character,

61
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,920
and of your strength,

62
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,400
and will show to the world that your Spirit,

63
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,840
which is enlightened within you, has given you

64
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,160
that strength and that new dimension.

65
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,480
So the second oath we have to take before Shri Ganesha is

66
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,760
that, "I will be honest to myself.

67
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,480
I will not deceive myself for anybody's sake."

68
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Now the third great thing about Shri Ganesha is

69
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,800
that for Him no Gods exist except His Mother.

70
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,360
And you know all the stories about Shri Ganesha,

71
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,920
how He adored His Mother,

72
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,240
because He knows His Mother is the Power;

73
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,640
and that He is the source of your wisdom,

74
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,800
He's the embodiment of wisdom,

75
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,400
and the greatest wisdom He has:

76
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,600
that it is better to worship the Mother

77
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,960
than anybody else, because She is the Power.

78
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,120
According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet,

79
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
you have to go through the Mother,

80
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,040
and secondly Father is just the Witness.

81
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,880
All His security, all His powers,

82
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,680
all His beauty, innocence, comes from His Mother.

83
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,360
So with the third oath you have to take

84
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,840
that, "For us, our Mother is so powerful,

85
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,280
why should we be afraid of anything?

86
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,080
If She is going to give us the wisdom,

87
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,920
why should we try to seek it anywhere else?"

88
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,280
I appear very innocent sometimes,

89
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,080
but My innocence is complete intelligence, I think,

90
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:59,000
and that is the reason, you see, people take time to accept.

91
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,880
But people like Shri Ganesh

92
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,000
who are the wisest of all, know the trick.

93
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,440
The another oath we have to take today

94
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,680
that, ’’We'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart,

95
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,200
because they are made in the form of Shri Ganesha.

96
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,320
We'll not make fun of them,

97
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
we'll not laugh at them’,

98
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,800
as long as they are in Sahaja Yoga we have to respect.

99
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,120
But they can be thrown away,

100
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,240
they can get out of it.

101
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,040
But unless and until this happens,

102
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,400
do not put your ego on other people.

103
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,760
Don't think that you understand everything.

104
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Don't think that you know everything.

105
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,160
Respect each and every person,

106
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,760
not for what he has read or what he has learnt,

107
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,920
but because he is a great soul.

108
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,400
I feel the whole West suffers from one, one simple disease,

109
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,720
that is, they do not know how to respect anyone.

110
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,080
Whatever doesn't suit their mind,

111
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,840
they will never accept nor will respect.

112
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,560
With their ego they want to judge everyone and condemn everyone.

113
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,360
So, get out of it,

114
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,000
and tell yourself, "I don't know anything.

115
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,480
I was a stupid fool with my ego."

116
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,880
Humble down yourself in your heart,

117
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,760
open your heart,

118
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,640
and love each other.

119
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,960
Respect and love

120
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,960
is the two things you have to promise to Shri Ganesha.

121
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,760
If you cannot do that, your ascent is going to be very difficult.

122
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,760
May God bless you!
