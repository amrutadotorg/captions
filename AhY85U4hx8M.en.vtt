02:15.460 --> 02:22.980
Today we are here to celebrate the resurrection
of Christ.

02:22.980 --> 02:29.780
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance
for all the Sahaj Yogis.

02:29.780 --> 02:38.230
And we have to understand that He resurrected
Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves.

02:38.230 --> 02:44.230
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

02:44.230 --> 02:50.140
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

02:50.140 --> 02:57.480
I see lots of people having this drama going
on: they are carrying the cross across to

02:57.480 --> 03:00.660
show as if we are going to do the job for
Christ!

03:00.660 --> 03:06.720
As if He has left some work to be done by
these people who play a drama.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.720
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

03:10.720 --> 03:20.799
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

03:20.799 --> 03:25.250
To make you weep and to make you cry, Christ
did not suffer.

03:25.250 --> 03:31.170
He suffered that you should enjoy, that you
should be happy, that you should lead a life

03:31.170 --> 03:38.459
of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty
who has created you.

03:38.459 --> 03:41.470
He would never like you to be unhappy.

03:41.470 --> 03:46.159
Which father would like his son to be unhappy?

03:46.159 --> 03:54.540
So we have to understand that His message
of His life, why He came on this Earth to

03:54.540 --> 03:58.780
do the greatest job is that of resurrection.

03:58.780 --> 04:04.099
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

04:04.099 --> 04:10.819
So we have to be eternally thankful to His
life and to Him, the way He did all these

04:10.819 --> 04:14.430
difficult tasks, taking upon Himself.

04:14.430 --> 04:18.250
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

04:18.250 --> 04:26.260
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om, He being the Logos, He being the Brahma

04:26.260 --> 04:29.750
could do it.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.900
But now you all have ascended.

04:32.900 --> 04:38.200
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.720
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

04:41.720 --> 04:51.650
He’s there within us, in our hearts, in
our eyes, and He has resurrected Himself and

04:51.650 --> 04:54.030
He has resurrected you, too.

04:54.030 --> 04:58.190
But now it is for you to resurrect other people.

04:58.190 --> 05:04.090
You can resurrect other people, this is the
power you have got through Him, maybe, or

05:04.090 --> 05:06.120
through your Kundalini.

05:06.120 --> 05:11.031
But you have this power to resurrect other
people, but first and foremost thing [is]

05:11.031 --> 05:18.250
you have to be strong like Christ: how He
obeyed His Mother and how He obeyed all the

05:18.250 --> 05:21.250
demands of His life.

05:21.250 --> 05:28.080
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

05:28.080 --> 05:35.300
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side or to become some sort of a big officer

05:35.300 --> 05:41.710
or to become another great rider, or a swimmer,
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing

05:41.710 --> 05:43.900
like that.

05:43.900 --> 05:50.030
(laughter) He didn’t try all these tricks,
and didn’t try to hanker after all these

05:50.030 --> 05:56.480
things that sometimes make us quite mad.

05:56.480 --> 06:10.260
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself, as the Divine vibrations

06:10.260 --> 06:13.050
itself, which He established.

06:13.050 --> 06:22.500
And what you have to do is to establish yourself
as the resurrected people, as the realised-souls,

06:22.500 --> 06:25.580
as the Sahaj Yogis.

06:25.580 --> 06:28.699
And this is going to be very easy.

06:28.699 --> 06:36.289
Now everything is made easy for you: your
realisation, then your powers, everything

06:36.289 --> 06:40.050
has beautifully settled within you.

06:40.050 --> 06:45.560
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly and
steadily.

06:45.560 --> 06:59.389
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something or have compelled you

06:59.389 --> 07:00.389
to do something.

07:00.389 --> 07:06.050
But through your own ascent you can see what’s
wrong with you or with the people about whom

07:06.050 --> 07:08.490
we are talking.

07:08.490 --> 07:17.390
And then you can also know through all these
powers whatever is to be known.

07:17.390 --> 07:21.600
All that is unknown can be your own, everything.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.350
But the attention should be towards your ascent,
towards the state.

07:26.350 --> 07:31.510
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

07:31.510 --> 07:34.910
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

07:34.910 --> 07:36.470
It is a state.

07:36.470 --> 07:40.980
It’s a state of your personality.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.169
And there where I always say…

07:42.169 --> 07:43.830
Excuse me, I think I’ll [remove my sweater].

07:43.830 --> 07:48.860
The sun is showing its results.

07:48.860 --> 07:50.530
See how the sun listens to me!

07:50.530 --> 07:54.340
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things, thanks.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.800
It’s very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

07:58.800 --> 08:13.449
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

08:13.449 --> 08:22.789
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me, so I better tell! (laughter

08:22.789 --> 08:28.390
and clapping).

08:28.390 --> 08:48.170
They have been telling for the last one year,
you see, we’ve been thinking of coming here

08:48.170 --> 08:50.680
for this puja.

08:50.680 --> 08:57.710
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here, but the dates were not

08:57.710 --> 09:01.390
very suitable, because those days the moon
would be waning.

09:01.390 --> 09:05.130
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

09:05.130 --> 09:06.970
We have to have the moon there.

09:06.970 --> 09:08.470
It’s important."

09:08.470 --> 09:12.690
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometime
later."

09:12.690 --> 09:17.570
And suddenly it happened that I have to come
here: luckily I was here.

09:17.570 --> 09:21.710
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling it’s going

09:21.710 --> 09:29.030
to rain heavily, it’s going to be very clouded
(laughter) and the temperature is going to

09:29.030 --> 09:37.340
be very bad and it’s going to be very, very
heavy rains.

09:37.340 --> 09:43.730
(laughter and clapping).

09:43.730 --> 09:56.210
And again and again, every night, every time
they announced about the weather it was looking

09:56.210 --> 09:59.010
even worse, every time.

09:59.010 --> 10:06.260
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

10:06.260 --> 10:13.660
(laughter) If you ask the clouds to move out
you have to have a tremendous breeze and that

10:13.660 --> 10:17.780
may spoil your tent.

10:17.780 --> 10:27.160
So somehow or other I just told the clouds
that, “You’d better move on to Newfoundland,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.570
slowly, steadily, not with great speed."

10:29.570 --> 10:35.090
And they did it.

10:35.090 --> 10:38.060
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

10:38.060 --> 10:42.500
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.800
So beautiful it was.

10:43.800 --> 10:48.430
And you were all asleep but I was awake, very
early (laughter).

10:48.430 --> 10:54.410
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

10:54.410 --> 11:01.500
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

11:01.500 --> 11:04.170
How obedient, how dedicated, how beautiful!”

11:04.170 --> 11:11.210
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,
you have to have proper light, you have to

11:11.210 --> 11:13.040
have proper temperature.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.700
So look at the sky!

11:15.700 --> 11:16.760
Look at everything!

11:16.760 --> 11:20.100
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.380
It’s beautiful!

11:21.380 --> 11:25.810
It became pink, beautifully pink, and then
now it’s shining.

11:25.810 --> 11:33.070
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

11:33.070 --> 11:43.630
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

11:43.630 --> 11:52.510
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya chakra.

11:52.510 --> 11:57.740
Christ resides in the Sun.

11:57.740 --> 12:05.480
And in the body, in the being, He is the Spirit.

12:05.480 --> 12:09.020
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

12:09.020 --> 12:13.530
And when He acts on the Agnya He’s the Sun.

12:13.530 --> 12:24.680
Now we have seen in His life that He was absolutely
spotlessly immaculate.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.370
He had no defects in Him.

12:28.370 --> 12:31.360
He was a perfect personality.

12:31.360 --> 12:37.310
“Then why did He want to resurrect?” one
can ask.

12:37.310 --> 12:41.890
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

12:41.890 --> 12:51.600
His resurrection is like making the way through
the Agnya chakra for all of you to pass through

12:51.600 --> 12:53.370
it.

12:53.370 --> 13:01.960
He was like the gate, or we should say He
was the One who opened the gate for all of

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
you.

13:02.960 --> 13:11.600
Because He was so perfect, He had no problems
as we have of our chakras, our Kundalini.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.200
He had no problems.

13:13.200 --> 13:26.460
But He was the complete compassion in the
nature of vibrations: the vibrations became

13:26.460 --> 13:29.180
complete compassion.

13:29.180 --> 13:37.960
So much so that even when He was resurrected
and even before that when He was crucified

13:37.960 --> 13:47.290
He said, “Oh, God, the Father, please forgive
those people because they do not know what

13:47.290 --> 13:49.320
they are doing."

13:49.320 --> 13:52.890
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

13:52.890 --> 13:59.040
And the Mother had to watch all that, keeping
quiet, because that was the game, that was

13:59.040 --> 14:02.140
the thing one had to do.

14:02.140 --> 14:06.100
He had to play His game and He played it so
well.

14:06.100 --> 14:13.110
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing: that He has done all

14:13.110 --> 14:17.360
this for us, now what are we going to do for
Him?

14:17.360 --> 14:20.390
He is the pattern we have to follow.

14:20.390 --> 14:25.160
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow, then it’s not that we carry the

14:25.160 --> 14:26.650
cross on our shoulder.

14:26.650 --> 14:30.880
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.190
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

14:34.190 --> 14:36.440
Anybody can carry the cross!

14:36.440 --> 14:44.200
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

14:44.200 --> 14:46.280
What is so great about it?

14:46.280 --> 14:50.200
What is so great in carrying a cross on your
shoulder?

14:50.200 --> 14:53.000
It’s nothing great.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.230
Any wrestler can do it, anybody can do it.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.560
That’s not the point!

14:58.560 --> 15:04.190
The point is we have to carry the work of
Christ, of resurrection.

15:04.190 --> 15:06.440
That is what we have to realise.

15:06.440 --> 15:14.550
We have to understand the importance of our
being, of our lives, like Christ understood

15:14.550 --> 15:17.850
that He has come for this great job here.

15:17.850 --> 15:24.120
And though He came as a human being, though
He came as an ordinary son of an ordinary

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
carpenter.

15:25.120 --> 15:32.830
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings, still He knew

15:32.830 --> 15:38.060
what He had to do, He knew what He had to
achieve and He achieved it.

15:38.060 --> 15:44.330
I think His was the most difficult task, which
He achieved and which He furnished it, so

15:44.330 --> 15:48.640
well, that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.070
Now let us see if we have done something for
Sahaj Yoga or not.

15:53.070 --> 15:57.220
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

15:57.220 --> 16:00.290
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

16:00.290 --> 16:05.350
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry the luggage of people downward

16:05.350 --> 16:06.790
they are carrying the cross of Christ.

16:06.790 --> 16:09.060
That’s not the way!

16:09.060 --> 16:12.750
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

16:12.750 --> 16:22.440
And that seriousness is: how far we have achieved
that state, for that what have we done?

16:22.440 --> 16:29.820
And a simple thing I have been asking all
of you: you have to meditate every day!

16:29.820 --> 16:33.410
All of you have to meditate everyday.

16:33.410 --> 16:38.350
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

16:38.350 --> 16:45.900
We are having these watches just to know that
we have to meditate, not for anything else.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.180
Our lives are for meditation.

16:48.180 --> 16:53.220
You need not spend all your twenty-four hours,
but you have to meditate!

16:53.220 --> 16:56.100
Everyday you must meditate.

16:56.100 --> 16:59.010
If you meditate your children will meditate.

16:59.010 --> 17:05.520
And meditation is such a simple thing for
you, made so easy that all the elements you

17:05.520 --> 17:07.799
can see work it out.

17:07.799 --> 17:14.539
All your chakras are made of different elements
and when you clear out with the different

17:14.539 --> 17:19.260
styles — I mean, you know all the methods
and the techniques of Sahaj Yoga — with

17:19.260 --> 17:27.670
that when you clear out the chakras, when
you clear them out you are absolutely free,

17:27.670 --> 17:32.100
absolutely at that stage where you have to
be.

17:32.100 --> 17:38.020
But if you do not do this much even — is
to meditate — it’s going to be very, very

17:38.020 --> 17:44.650
difficult for me and for you to achieve, for
which you have come on this Earth.

17:44.650 --> 17:51.350
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that, but I know how to do it,

17:51.350 --> 17:53.490
and you also know how to do it.

17:53.490 --> 17:58.100
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

17:58.100 --> 18:05.320
Now, by now you must have realised, all these
so-called religions in anybody’s name: whether

18:05.320 --> 18:10.680
it is in the name of Islam, in the name of
Christianity, in the name of Hinduism, in

18:10.680 --> 18:14.330
the name of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

18:14.330 --> 18:19.950
It has no truth in it.

18:19.950 --> 18:23.910
They have all tried to use it for their own
purposes.

18:23.910 --> 18:31.870
There’s only one truth and that is: all
these great prophets and all these great incarnations

18:31.870 --> 18:38.430
came on this Earth for your ascent and not
for establishing those religions who are just

18:38.430 --> 18:40.920
interested in money.

18:40.920 --> 18:47.100
In these religions also you will find there
are people who are either left-sided or right-sided.

18:47.100 --> 18:52.280
There are some religions which preach you
should be very, very strict: you should not

18:52.280 --> 18:57.180
do this, you should not do that, you should
not drink, you should not smoke.

18:57.180 --> 19:01.560
There are some who say you should not marry,
you should not look at women, you should not

19:01.560 --> 19:05.070
look at men — all kinds of restrictions.

19:05.070 --> 19:08.940
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised, there
are so many restrictions.

19:08.940 --> 19:20.370
If you see the amount of superstitions that
exist and that are created by brahmins in

19:20.370 --> 19:21.690
India you will be shocked.

19:21.690 --> 19:26.550
For everything there’s a superstition: if
you walk with the left hand ahead, that means

19:26.550 --> 19:31.450
this, if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this; if you sit like this, that

19:31.450 --> 19:32.450
means that.

19:32.450 --> 19:33.450
Everything!

19:33.450 --> 19:38.540
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

19:38.540 --> 19:41.770
All kinds of absurdities there are in Islam,
too.

19:41.770 --> 19:47.990
But when we find them in a free place like
England, where there’s complete left-sidedness,

19:47.990 --> 19:52.420
where you can do what you like but still you
are a Christian: if you drink, it’s all

19:52.420 --> 19:58.300
right; if you have ten wives, it’s all right;
if you have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

19:58.300 --> 20:04.430
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

20:04.430 --> 20:09.720
So there’s nothing [forbidden], especially
for the Protestants – that’s the religion

20:09.720 --> 20:14.000
I was born in, where everything is allowed.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.650
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is, then, comes

20:18.650 --> 20:23.030
to, that, if you ask them the road, they’ll
tell you which way to go — that’s Christianity.

20:23.030 --> 20:25.640
It’s coming to that end.

20:25.640 --> 20:32.890
Now, all these religions either are indulging
into the Right Side or onto the Left Side.

20:32.890 --> 20:36.490
Some people like the Left Side and some people
like the Right Side.

20:36.490 --> 20:41.160
I will tell you the story of a priest, I went
to see him in Russia.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.890
I think I have told it to some people before.

20:43.890 --> 20:49.620
I went to Russia and the Russian people asked
me, “What would you like to see?”

20:49.620 --> 20:53.530
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

20:53.530 --> 20:56.170
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church."

20:56.170 --> 21:02.610
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, and a Black Order,

21:02.610 --> 21:03.680
which is supposed to be the highest.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.980
I don’t know how they call it.

21:05.980 --> 21:12.530
So we went inside and the priest said, “All
right, today I’m sorry, we cannot offer

21:12.530 --> 21:15.050
you meat because our fasting is there.

21:15.050 --> 21:16.930
But we’ll have lunch."

21:16.930 --> 21:18.900
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and all that.

21:18.900 --> 21:23.790
But the priest was only busy drinking, because
it was a fasting, so drinking is allowed,

21:23.790 --> 21:24.790
according to them!

21:24.790 --> 21:27.610
So he was drinking and drinking and drinking.

21:27.610 --> 21:30.700
He drank so much that he forgot we were there!

21:30.700 --> 21:34.870
We were supposed to be VIPs: just lost himself
into drinking!

21:34.870 --> 21:38.250
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat.

21:38.250 --> 21:44.570
So we got up and walked out of that place
and this fellow didn’t even come to wish

21:44.570 --> 21:45.570
us.

21:45.570 --> 21:48.880
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink, and didn’t do anything,

21:48.880 --> 21:50.560
and they were laughing and laughing.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.110
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

21:52.110 --> 21:55.360
That’s why we didn’t want to take to Christianity."

21:55.360 --> 21:58.480
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ."

21:58.480 --> 22:02.030
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

22:02.030 --> 22:04.530
I said, “It’s not."

22:04.530 --> 22:14.400
Now this gentleman, was supposed to be the
highest person in spirituality living in Russia!

22:14.400 --> 22:17.070
So they have told me a story about the tzars.

22:17.070 --> 22:21.970
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought, “Everybody’s having

22:21.970 --> 22:23.710
a religion, we have no religion.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.800
Must have some religion."

22:25.800 --> 22:33.580
So they sent for some people and the people
who came forward were Catholics to begin with.

22:33.580 --> 22:38.630
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion."

22:38.630 --> 22:41.870
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

22:41.870 --> 22:48.020
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife."

22:48.020 --> 22:50.120
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

22:50.120 --> 22:53.170
We have to have many tsarinas, you see, for
different purposes.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.080
So we can’t have that religion!”

22:56.080 --> 22:57.740
So they cancelled it.

22:57.740 --> 23:03.170
So then the Islam: you see that time I think
they were no hindus available, thank God!

23:03.170 --> 23:10.300
They had the Islam, Islam people went, and
the Islamic people said, “No, all right,

23:10.300 --> 23:16.440
you can have five wives, it’s all right,
but you cannot drink."

23:16.440 --> 23:19.930
They said, “That’s impossible!

23:19.930 --> 23:22.200
How can we follow Islam?

23:22.200 --> 23:23.570
That’s not possible!”

23:23.570 --> 23:24.960
So, cancel it!

23:24.960 --> 23:29.790
So these orthodox people — orthodox, you
see, the word orthodox remember that — they

23:29.790 --> 23:30.790
came.

23:30.790 --> 23:33.440
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

23:33.440 --> 23:40.120
We don’t mind if you drink, we don’t mind
if you have many wives, we don’t mind.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.130
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

23:42.130 --> 23:46.240
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

23:46.240 --> 23:50.960
And that’s how they had this religion there.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.580
So this is the situation of the religion today.

23:53.580 --> 24:03.360
All these religions have become sort of deformed
statues, good for nothing.

24:03.360 --> 24:10.820
So now the inner religion within us is the
Sahaja dharma, which has to be fully followed.

24:10.820 --> 24:16.460
Now, I told, in India, that now you are all
become Sahajas.

24:16.460 --> 24:23.990
The story is like this, that there was a villager
who became a Christian.

24:23.990 --> 24:27.770
So he came down to Allahabad to become Christian.

24:27.770 --> 24:33.000
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name because now I am Saheb, I have

24:33.000 --> 24:34.200
become an English man.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.280
So you better give me a big name."

24:35.280 --> 24:36.360
They said, “What name you want?”

24:36.360 --> 24:39.650
He said “Give me the name of Alexander the
Great!”

24:39.650 --> 24:41.380
So they called him Alexander.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.740
But his name was Blondie, you see.

24:43.740 --> 24:49.780
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they called
him Alexander Bhoora.

24:49.780 --> 24:50.780
So Mr.

24:50.780 --> 24:56.190
Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and went
to the River Ganges for having his bath.

24:56.190 --> 25:00.020
So the priest said, the pastor, he said, “You
can’t do that!”

25:00.020 --> 25:01.150
He said, “Why?

25:01.150 --> 25:03.030
Why can’t I do that?”

25:03.030 --> 25:06.340
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges because the Christianity

25:06.340 --> 25:07.340
will drop out, you see!”

25:07.340 --> 25:09.420
If he goes and has a bath in the River Ganges.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.680
He said, “This you can’t do!”

25:12.680 --> 25:18.840
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb, I have become Englishman, that doesn’t

25:18.840 --> 25:21.800
mean I have given up my religion!”

25:21.800 --> 25:22.800
You see!

25:22.800 --> 25:30.520
This is exactly what is happening to us when
we try to follow any religion whatsoever.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.690
Now we are all identified with our so-called
religions in which we were born.

25:34.690 --> 25:40.180
For example, if I told Indians, “Now, you
don’t go to temples!

25:40.180 --> 25:45.960
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple, unless and until you

25:45.960 --> 25:49.560
have told me, don’t go to a swayambhu temple
at any cost."

25:49.560 --> 25:58.070
There are many churches also where there are
very good statues, we can say, or have got

25:58.070 --> 26:01.440
something which are really swayambhus, but
they are very few.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.430
So you tell me and then go.

26:04.430 --> 26:10.170
But they wouldn’t listen to me, they won’t
listen, and when they go there they catch

26:10.170 --> 26:11.390
on their Agnyas.

26:11.390 --> 26:17.950
Once I went to see one temple which was of
course a swayambhu temple, no doubt, so some

26:17.950 --> 26:20.350
Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

26:20.350 --> 26:23.580
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

26:23.580 --> 26:26.480
When they came back, as soon as they saw me,
they all fainted.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.480
I said, “What happened?

26:27.480 --> 26:28.510
Where did you go?”

26:28.510 --> 26:30.570
“Oh, we went to this temple."

26:30.570 --> 26:31.570
I said, “Why?

26:31.570 --> 26:32.690
You never told me.

26:32.690 --> 26:33.994
And what do you have here [on your forehead]?”

26:33.994 --> 26:37.830
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka (bindi)
and it’s finished!

26:37.830 --> 26:40.750
Then it took them one month to clear out!

26:40.750 --> 26:46.490
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

26:46.490 --> 26:53.370
Same with the Christians: now the other day
I heard about the Paris episode where people

26:53.370 --> 27:00.370
wanted to have weddings in the church, in
Paris.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.059
So they must have special dresses!

27:02.059 --> 27:07.140
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from…what shop is that?

27:07.140 --> 27:10.340
I forgot the name, some big name.

27:10.340 --> 27:16.940
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

27:16.940 --> 27:22.650
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

27:22.650 --> 27:26.560
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

27:26.560 --> 27:31.180
What has happened is that in the church there
are many dead bodies buried, and they are

27:31.180 --> 27:33.460
all caught up.

27:33.460 --> 27:40.250
So when you go also to see the beautiful architecture,
go with a detached mind.

27:40.250 --> 27:43.390
Don’t think that you belong to that church.

27:43.390 --> 27:45.510
You don’t belong to any church.

27:45.510 --> 27:47.610
You don’t belong to any temple.

27:47.610 --> 27:52.370
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

27:52.370 --> 28:01.390
And I have to tell you today that Christ did
not belong to any religion.

28:01.390 --> 28:03.610
He didn’t follow any religion.

28:03.610 --> 28:06.840
He followed His own spiritual religion.

28:06.840 --> 28:12.870
When He went to one church where there were
people who were discussing, I mean they were

28:12.870 --> 28:16.490
Jews, He went there and He was talking to
them.

28:16.490 --> 28:22.390
The other day I saw a beautiful painting they
had given on the newspaper, a very beautiful

28:22.390 --> 28:28.150
famous painting where Christ is talking to
the doctors and He is holding His, rubbing

28:28.150 --> 28:38.450
His Left Swadhishthana, very nicely, and all
the doctors, one of them is listening to Him,

28:38.450 --> 28:43.190
one of them is looking at Him, sneering at
Him, another one is little bit paying attention

28:43.190 --> 28:44.190
to Him.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.530
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

28:46.530 --> 28:48.380
It’s clearly [shown].

28:48.380 --> 28:52.100
You can see it so clearly!

28:52.100 --> 28:56.612
And so now, with these new achievements, you
must rise above all these things and you must

28:56.612 --> 29:02.190
understand that we have to be very independently
looking at ourselves.

29:02.190 --> 29:05.920
We are no more belonging to any religion.

29:05.920 --> 29:12.150
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

29:12.150 --> 29:19.100
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread
only when you really become nothing but Sahaj.

29:19.100 --> 29:23.490
But that’s something I don’t understand
— it doesn’t work out.

29:23.490 --> 29:30.540
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called ‘Hamaty’ or something

29:30.540 --> 29:36.350
who was supposed to be an incarnation or something.

29:36.350 --> 29:41.660
His disciples absolutely, I should say that
they behave in such a manner that you can’t

29:41.660 --> 29:45.540
believe it: how ardently they believe in this
man.

29:45.540 --> 29:52.340
Whatever he says, whatever he does, how they
believe in him.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.850
It’s very surprising.

29:53.850 --> 30:01.580
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone, you’ll be surprised the way they

30:01.580 --> 30:06.270
are fanatic about this fellow and they will
not hear anything against.

30:06.270 --> 30:12.690
Leave alone that, but if he says, “You stand
on your head for the whole night,” they

30:12.690 --> 30:13.721
will do it!

30:13.721 --> 30:18.860
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it, and when

30:18.860 --> 30:26.910
we know the truth, this is the truth, then
we take advantage and we try to compromise.

30:26.910 --> 30:34.460
We think the truth will not do anything about
it.

30:34.460 --> 30:38.730
Not that truth will punish you, it will not,
because you are realised-souls.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.890
It will not.

30:40.890 --> 30:44.650
It will not punish you up to a point.

30:44.650 --> 30:51.790
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely working
at the same time.

30:51.790 --> 30:58.730
If we do anything wrong, like these people
went to the church, they were all caught up.

30:58.730 --> 31:02.300
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

31:02.300 --> 31:05.570
We are Sahaj Yogis."

31:05.570 --> 31:10.150
Because you are vulnerable, you are vulnerable.

31:10.150 --> 31:13.160
Yet you have not reached that stage.

31:13.160 --> 31:17.960
If you reach that stage, then when you go
there, all the church people will come out

31:17.960 --> 31:20.730
of the church and run away.

31:20.730 --> 31:24.150
They’ll start shaking before you.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.750
They will not know what has happened.

31:25.750 --> 31:31.870
I have seen when I enter into any church all
the candles start going chuk, chuk, chuk,

31:31.870 --> 31:35.520
chuk, chuk, chuk, and people start wondering
what has happened.

31:35.520 --> 31:41.710
Even when they are having a dinner or something
and there is a candlelight dinner I am surprised

31:41.710 --> 31:45.940
the way every candle starts flickering and
people start looking.

31:45.940 --> 31:51.970
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see, so the candles immediately show that

31:51.970 --> 31:53.770
these are the bhoots sitting here.

31:53.770 --> 31:59.370
With all this knowledge that you have, the
light you have within yourself, by which you

31:59.370 --> 32:03.990
are enlightened, still if you are going to
these left and right-sided things, it’s

32:03.990 --> 32:05.799
very, very dangerous.

32:05.799 --> 32:13.520
We see that also, today, I must tell you about
the part that is politics.

32:13.520 --> 32:17.860
In politics also these people have developed
two types of theories: one is left-sided,

32:17.860 --> 32:19.309
one right-sided.

32:19.309 --> 32:25.270
The left-sided theories are democratic, where
you can indulge into anything you like.

32:25.270 --> 32:27.870
It’s the individual that is important.

32:27.870 --> 32:32.910
The individual indulges into everything and
you should not stop him from doing whatever

32:32.910 --> 32:36.910
he likes, he’s an individual: so he has
a right to cut his nose, he has a right to

32:36.910 --> 32:40.820
cut his eyes, to do what he likes.

32:40.820 --> 32:48.360
An individual is allowed to do what he likes
to do, and then what happens [is] that we

32:48.360 --> 32:54.320
find this democracy becomes a demonocracy:
everybody is a demon.

32:54.320 --> 33:02.990
Everybody is busy cutting throats, cutting
all the basis and the roots of life because

33:02.990 --> 33:08.800
everybody is Brahma, becomes a great personality,
because the individual is so great and the

33:08.800 --> 33:12.600
collective is lost, completely lost.

33:12.600 --> 33:21.280
But on the other side, where it is more discipline,
more aggressiveness, more controls and everything

33:21.280 --> 33:26.410
[with] the Right Side, which we can call as
communism, where people are controlled all

33:26.410 --> 33:27.730
the time.

33:27.730 --> 33:28.730
Now why?

33:28.730 --> 33:32.710
Because for the collective the individual
must sacrifice.

33:32.710 --> 33:38.070
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak, then the

33:38.070 --> 33:41.490
collective cannot be strong: it cannot be
strong.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.360
The individuals have to be strong.

33:43.360 --> 33:50.100
For example, you will see that the people
who come from communist countries, they drink

33:50.100 --> 33:53.340
more than people who can drink here.

33:53.340 --> 33:58.799
Or those who come, say from Islamic countries,
where they don’t touch anything, can drink

33:58.799 --> 34:01.070
more than even sardarjees.

34:01.070 --> 34:07.200
So you can imagine what is the situation of
human beings is that, out of fear if you try

34:07.200 --> 34:10.520
to control him, he goes to the Right Side.

34:10.520 --> 34:19.409
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed, he doesn’t accept the situation,

34:19.409 --> 34:25.830
he doesn’t become that, he doesn’t have
that power to control himself.

34:25.830 --> 34:30.690
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.

34:30.690 --> 34:33.030
He’s still there.

34:33.030 --> 34:35.980
As soon as he gets a chance he falls into
it.

34:35.980 --> 34:37.560
So that fails.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.310
So the individuals are weak in that case.

34:40.310 --> 34:47.320
And where there is complete abandonment, do
what you like, live the way you like, indulgences,

34:47.320 --> 34:49.869
all kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

34:49.869 --> 34:55.540
I mean, everyday you see and you say, “Oh
God, this is a decadent society, this is happening!”

34:55.540 --> 35:02.450
Decadence is because an individual [to] whom
you have given all these powers, has no power

35:02.450 --> 35:03.540
to bear them.

35:03.540 --> 35:07.100
An individual cannot bear money.

35:07.100 --> 35:10.310
He cannot bear power of any kind.

35:10.310 --> 35:13.230
He cannot bear love.

35:13.230 --> 35:16.550
He cannot bear kindness.

35:16.550 --> 35:22.960
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

35:22.960 --> 35:30.220
But when an individual becomes the collective
— this is the ascent through the central

35:30.220 --> 35:40.370
path — when he becomes the collective, in
his strength he strengthens the collective.

35:40.370 --> 35:46.520
And also the collective looks after, protects,
and guides the individual.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.430
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

35:48.430 --> 35:54.710
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

35:54.710 --> 36:05.250
And there where we feel that still we are
something great, we are different, we are

36:05.250 --> 36:13.200
Indians or we are from England or from France,
still if you are identified then you are not

36:13.200 --> 36:14.840
collective.

36:14.840 --> 36:20.930
In collective sense we are all one, part and
parcel of one being.

36:20.930 --> 36:26.520
Then you are really acting as collective being
and you are one with the Divine.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.869
Where the Sun is looking after you, the Moon
is looking after you, the winds are looking

36:30.869 --> 36:38.520
after you; all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

36:38.520 --> 36:47.250
Ether, everything is working for you and you
are so well-protected and blessed by the special

36:47.250 --> 36:51.080
quality to enjoy the joy.

36:51.080 --> 36:57.520
Then you really become sensitive to that joy,
when you are one with the whole.

36:57.520 --> 37:04.340
Like if supposing this finger or this finger
is not one with the whole, is numbed out…as

37:04.340 --> 37:09.350
it happens in leprosy, what happens that this
finger becomes numbed out.

37:09.350 --> 37:18.390
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know
because there is no connection, no nerves

37:18.390 --> 37:20.460
acting, it’s insensitive.

37:20.460 --> 37:28.000
In the same way if you are not collective
and not bothered about collective you are

37:28.000 --> 37:31.770
going to be dropped out.

37:31.770 --> 37:40.080
You are not going to be there to enjoy the
beauties of your own glory and that of the

37:40.080 --> 37:41.640
collective.

37:41.640 --> 37:47.580
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves, we have to ascend and we

37:47.580 --> 37:49.000
have to be collective.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.240
It’s very easy to find out faults with others.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.700
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

37:55.700 --> 38:01.000
Very easy also to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.730
Better find faults with yourself.

38:03.730 --> 38:06.440
The rest I’ll look after.

38:06.440 --> 38:13.340
First you just find faults with yourself and
try to understand others and love others and

38:13.340 --> 38:16.220
enjoy the company of others.

38:16.220 --> 38:24.550
This, once you decide that we have to enjoy,
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

38:24.550 --> 38:31.520
Just this decision, this faith, within you
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

38:31.520 --> 38:36.430
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

38:36.430 --> 38:41.420
Just this decision itself will give you the
power to enjoy.

38:41.420 --> 38:49.380
But the decision should be firm, no hypocrisy,
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,

38:49.380 --> 38:55.970
nothing, just pure desire within us that we
have to be the Spirit.

38:55.970 --> 39:00.300
And the Spirit which is the collective being
within us.

39:00.300 --> 39:09.910
I hope today on this day of resurrection,
we have to be thankful to Christ very much

39:09.910 --> 39:23.050
for showing us the way and also we have to
be very much concerned and alerted about ourselves:

39:23.050 --> 39:24.450
Where are we?

39:24.450 --> 39:26.310
Where do we stand?

39:26.310 --> 39:27.970
What are we up to?

39:27.970 --> 39:30.070
What are we doing?

39:30.070 --> 39:32.080
What is our responsibility?

39:32.080 --> 39:33.990
What is expected of us?

39:33.990 --> 39:36.830
Why all these blessings are given to us?

39:36.830 --> 39:41.240
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga, no sacrifice.

39:41.240 --> 39:49.630
Nobody wants you anything to commit or to
do or membership or anything like that.

39:49.630 --> 39:51.350
I think it’s my commitment.

39:51.350 --> 40:00.850
As I said, that God has the commitment but
you also have one commitment that your desire

40:00.850 --> 40:01.850
should be pure.

40:01.850 --> 40:06.450
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

40:06.450 --> 40:09.990
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out."

40:09.990 --> 40:13.740
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and that’s
what He achieved.

40:13.740 --> 40:17.820
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

40:17.820 --> 40:19.869
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday.

40:19.869 --> 40:27.590
Now imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age
and at this age most of the ladies, you see,

40:27.590 --> 40:33.480
just, I don’t know what they do.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.480
(laughter)

40:34.480 --> 40:46.030
So now you must come up and work out everything
as far as possible, thinking that we all have

40:46.030 --> 40:47.030
to stand up.

40:47.030 --> 40:48.810
Now the children are coming up.

40:48.810 --> 40:50.870
They are also going to stand up.

40:50.870 --> 40:53.740
You are all looking younger to me and younger
to me.

40:53.740 --> 40:55.750
Every day I see you, you look younger.

40:55.750 --> 40:59.700
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you, the
way you look younger and I think, is he the

40:59.700 --> 41:07.840
son or is he the father?

41:07.840 --> 41:16.420
The situation is such that you are all blessed:
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.

41:16.420 --> 41:19.830
And everybody tells me, “Mother, this is
what has happened, that has happened!” everything.

41:19.830 --> 41:21.230
Now, so what?

41:21.230 --> 41:25.080
These are temptations, be careful.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.849
This is not what you wanted.

41:26.849 --> 41:35.460
What you wanted is the state of that complete
faith within yourself where you don’t have

41:35.460 --> 41:41.670
to ask, nothing — everything will work out.

41:41.670 --> 41:42.670
It works!

41:42.670 --> 41:44.790
That’s [what] the point is.

41:44.790 --> 41:54.230
So, I hope next time when we meet I’ll see
even younger people than what I see today

41:54.230 --> 41:57.360
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.800
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.340
He was very young, I must say.

42:03.340 --> 42:08.660
But how much He has done for humanity.

42:08.660 --> 42:12.530
Nobody could have achieved that much in that
small age as He has done it.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.670
It’s remarkable!

42:13.670 --> 42:15.380
It’s really remarkable!

42:15.380 --> 42:20.590
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

42:20.590 --> 42:25.710
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.500
And today is the day of certain promises.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.870
May God bless you for that.

42:29.870 --> 42:33.130
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
