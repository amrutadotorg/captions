00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.980
Today we are here to celebrate the resurrection
of Christ.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.780
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance
for all the Sahaj Yogis.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:38.230
And we have to understand that He resurrected
Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.230
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.140
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.480
I see lots of people having this drama going
on: they are carrying the cross across to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.660
show as if we are going to do the job for
Christ!

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.720
As if He has left some work to be done by
these people who play a drama.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.720
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:20.799
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.250
To make you weep and to make you cry, Christ
did not suffer.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.170
He suffered that you should enjoy, that you
should be happy, that you should lead a life

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.459
of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty
who has created you.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.470
He would never like you to be unhappy.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.159
Which father would like his son to be unhappy?

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:54.540
So we have to understand that His message
of His life, why He came on this Earth to

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.780
do the greatest job is that of resurrection.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.099
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.819
So we have to be eternally thankful to His
life and to Him, the way He did all these

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.430
difficult tasks, taking upon Himself.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.250
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.260
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om, He being the Logos, He being the Brahma

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.750
could do it.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.900
But now you all have ascended.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.200
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.720
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:51.650
He’s there within us, in our hearts, in
our eyes, and He has resurrected Himself and

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.030
He has resurrected you, too.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.190
But now it is for you to resurrect other people.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.090
You can resurrect other people, this is the
power you have got through Him, maybe, or

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.120
through your Kundalini.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.031
But you have this power to resurrect other
people, but first and foremost thing [is]

00:05:11.031 --> 00:05:18.250
you have to be strong like Christ: how He
obeyed His Mother and how He obeyed all the

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.250
demands of His life.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.080
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.300
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side or to become some sort of a big officer

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.710
or to become another great rider, or a swimmer,
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.900
like that.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.030
(laughter) He didn’t try all these tricks,
and didn’t try to hanker after all these

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.480
things that sometimes make us quite mad.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:10.260
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself, as the Divine vibrations

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.050
itself, which He established.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:22.500
And what you have to do is to establish yourself
as the resurrected people, as the realised-souls,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.580
as the Sahaj Yogis.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.699
And this is going to be very easy.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:36.289
Now everything is made easy for you: your
realisation, then your powers, everything

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.050
has beautifully settled within you.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.560
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly and
steadily.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:59.389
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something or have compelled you

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:00.389
to do something.

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:06.050
But through your own ascent you can see what’s
wrong with you or with the people about whom

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.490
we are talking.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:17.390
And then you can also know through all these
powers whatever is to be known.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.600
All that is unknown can be your own, everything.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.350
But the attention should be towards your ascent,
towards the state.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.510
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.910
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.470
It is a state.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.980
It’s a state of your personality.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.169
And there where I always say…

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:43.830
Excuse me, I think I’ll [remove my sweater].

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.860
The sun is showing its results.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.530
See how the sun listens to me!

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.340
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things, thanks.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.800
It’s very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:13.449
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:22.789
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me, so I better tell! (laughter

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:28.390
and clapping).

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:48.170
They have been telling for the last one year,
you see, we’ve been thinking of coming here

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.680
for this puja.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:57.710
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here, but the dates were not

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.390
very suitable, because those days the moon
would be waning.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.130
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.970
We have to have the moon there.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.470
It’s important."

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.690
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometime
later."

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.570
And suddenly it happened that I have to come
here: luckily I was here.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.710
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling it’s going

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:29.030
to rain heavily, it’s going to be very clouded
(laughter) and the temperature is going to

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:37.340
be very bad and it’s going to be very, very
heavy rains.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:43.730
(laughter and clapping).

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:56.210
And again and again, every night, every time
they announced about the weather it was looking

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.010
even worse, every time.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:06.260
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:13.660
(laughter) If you ask the clouds to move out
you have to have a tremendous breeze and that

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.780
may spoil your tent.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:27.160
So somehow or other I just told the clouds
that, “You’d better move on to Newfoundland,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.570
slowly, steadily, not with great speed."

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:35.090
And they did it.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.060
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.500
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.800
So beautiful it was.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.430
And you were all asleep but I was awake, very
early (laughter).

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:54.410
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:01.500
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.170
How obedient, how dedicated, how beautiful!”

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:11.210
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,
you have to have proper light, you have to

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.040
have proper temperature.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.700
So look at the sky!

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.760
Look at everything!

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.100
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.380
It’s beautiful!

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.810
It became pink, beautifully pink, and then
now it’s shining.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:33.070
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:43.630
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:52.510
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya chakra.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:57.740
Christ resides in the Sun.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:05.480
And in the body, in the being, He is the Spirit.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.020
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.530
And when He acts on the Agnya He’s the Sun.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:24.680
Now we have seen in His life that He was absolutely
spotlessly immaculate.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.370
He had no defects in Him.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.360
He was a perfect personality.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.310
“Then why did He want to resurrect?” one
can ask.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.890
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:51.600
His resurrection is like making the way through
the Agnya chakra for all of you to pass through

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.370
it.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:13:01.960
He was like the gate, or we should say He
was the One who opened the gate for all of

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960
you.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:11.600
Because He was so perfect, He had no problems
as we have of our chakras, our Kundalini.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.200
He had no problems.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:26.460
But He was the complete compassion in the
nature of vibrations: the vibrations became

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.180
complete compassion.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:37.960
So much so that even when He was resurrected
and even before that when He was crucified

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:47.290
He said, “Oh, God, the Father, please forgive
those people because they do not know what

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.320
they are doing."

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.890
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:59.040
And the Mother had to watch all that, keeping
quiet, because that was the game, that was

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.140
the thing one had to do.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.100
He had to play His game and He played it so
well.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:13.110
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing: that He has done all

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:17.360
this for us, now what are we going to do for
Him?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.390
He is the pattern we have to follow.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.160
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow, then it’s not that we carry the

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.650
cross on our shoulder.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.880
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.190
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.440
Anybody can carry the cross!

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:44.200
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.280
What is so great about it?

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.200
What is so great in carrying a cross on your
shoulder?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.000
It’s nothing great.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.230
Any wrestler can do it, anybody can do it.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.560
That’s not the point!

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.190
The point is we have to carry the work of
Christ, of resurrection.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.440
That is what we have to realise.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:14.550
We have to understand the importance of our
being, of our lives, like Christ understood

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.850
that He has come for this great job here.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:24.120
And though He came as a human being, though
He came as an ordinary son of an ordinary

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120
carpenter.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.830
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings, still He knew

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:38.060
what He had to do, He knew what He had to
achieve and He achieved it.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:44.330
I think His was the most difficult task, which
He achieved and which He furnished it, so

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.640
well, that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.070
Now let us see if we have done something for
Sahaj Yoga or not.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:57.220
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.290
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:05.350
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry the luggage of people downward

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.790
they are carrying the cross of Christ.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.060
That’s not the way!

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.750
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:22.440
And that seriousness is: how far we have achieved
that state, for that what have we done?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:29.820
And a simple thing I have been asking all
of you: you have to meditate every day!

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.410
All of you have to meditate everyday.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:38.350
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:45.900
We are having these watches just to know that
we have to meditate, not for anything else.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.180
Our lives are for meditation.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.220
You need not spend all your twenty-four hours,
but you have to meditate!

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.100
Everyday you must meditate.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.010
If you meditate your children will meditate.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:05.520
And meditation is such a simple thing for
you, made so easy that all the elements you

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.799
can see work it out.

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:14.539
All your chakras are made of different elements
and when you clear out with the different

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:19.260
styles — I mean, you know all the methods
and the techniques of Sahaj Yoga — with

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:27.670
that when you clear out the chakras, when
you clear them out you are absolutely free,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.100
absolutely at that stage where you have to
be.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:38.020
But if you do not do this much even — is
to meditate — it’s going to be very, very

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:44.650
difficult for me and for you to achieve, for
which you have come on this Earth.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:51.350
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that, but I know how to do it,

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.490
and you also know how to do it.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.100
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:05.320
Now, by now you must have realised, all these
so-called religions in anybody’s name: whether

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.680
it is in the name of Islam, in the name of
Christianity, in the name of Hinduism, in

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.330
the name of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:19.950
It has no truth in it.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.910
They have all tried to use it for their own
purposes.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:31.870
There’s only one truth and that is: all
these great prophets and all these great incarnations

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:38.430
came on this Earth for your ascent and not
for establishing those religions who are just

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.920
interested in money.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:47.100
In these religions also you will find there
are people who are either left-sided or right-sided.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.280
There are some religions which preach you
should be very, very strict: you should not

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.180
do this, you should not do that, you should
not drink, you should not smoke.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.560
There are some who say you should not marry,
you should not look at women, you should not

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.070
look at men — all kinds of restrictions.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.940
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised, there
are so many restrictions.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:20.370
If you see the amount of superstitions that
exist and that are created by brahmins in

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.690
India you will be shocked.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.550
For everything there’s a superstition: if
you walk with the left hand ahead, that means

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.450
this, if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this; if you sit like this, that

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.450
means that.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.450
Everything!

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:38.540
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.770
All kinds of absurdities there are in Islam,
too.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:47.990
But when we find them in a free place like
England, where there’s complete left-sidedness,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.420
where you can do what you like but still you
are a Christian: if you drink, it’s all

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:58.300
right; if you have ten wives, it’s all right;
if you have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:04.430
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:09.720
So there’s nothing [forbidden], especially
for the Protestants – that’s the religion

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.000
I was born in, where everything is allowed.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.650
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is, then, comes

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.030
to, that, if you ask them the road, they’ll
tell you which way to go — that’s Christianity.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.640
It’s coming to that end.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:32.890
Now, all these religions either are indulging
into the Right Side or onto the Left Side.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.490
Some people like the Left Side and some people
like the Right Side.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.160
I will tell you the story of a priest, I went
to see him in Russia.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.890
I think I have told it to some people before.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:49.620
I went to Russia and the Russian people asked
me, “What would you like to see?”

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.530
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.170
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church."

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:02.610
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, and a Black Order,

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:03.680
which is supposed to be the highest.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.980
I don’t know how they call it.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:12.530
So we went inside and the priest said, “All
right, today I’m sorry, we cannot offer

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.050
you meat because our fasting is there.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.930
But we’ll have lunch."

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.900
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and all that.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.790
But the priest was only busy drinking, because
it was a fasting, so drinking is allowed,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.790
according to them!

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.610
So he was drinking and drinking and drinking.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.700
He drank so much that he forgot we were there!

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.870
We were supposed to be VIPs: just lost himself
into drinking!

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.250
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:44.570
So we got up and walked out of that place
and this fellow didn’t even come to wish

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.570
us.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.880
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink, and didn’t do anything,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.560
and they were laughing and laughing.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.110
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.360
That’s why we didn’t want to take to Christianity."

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.480
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ."

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.030
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.530
I said, “It’s not."

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:14.400
Now this gentleman, was supposed to be the
highest person in spirituality living in Russia!

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.070
So they have told me a story about the tzars.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:21.970
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought, “Everybody’s having

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.710
a religion, we have no religion.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.800
Must have some religion."

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:33.580
So they sent for some people and the people
who came forward were Catholics to begin with.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.630
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion."

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.870
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:48.020
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife."

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.120
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.170
We have to have many tsarinas, you see, for
different purposes.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.080
So we can’t have that religion!”

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.740
So they cancelled it.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:03.170
So then the Islam: you see that time I think
they were no hindus available, thank God!

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:10.300
They had the Islam, Islam people went, and
the Islamic people said, “No, all right,

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:16.440
you can have five wives, it’s all right,
but you cannot drink."

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.930
They said, “That’s impossible!

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.200
How can we follow Islam?

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.570
That’s not possible!”

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.960
So, cancel it!

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.790
So these orthodox people — orthodox, you
see, the word orthodox remember that — they

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.790
came.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.440
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.120
We don’t mind if you drink, we don’t mind
if you have many wives, we don’t mind.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.130
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.240
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.960
And that’s how they had this religion there.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.580
So this is the situation of the religion today.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:24:03.360
All these religions have become sort of deformed
statues, good for nothing.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:10.820
So now the inner religion within us is the
Sahaja dharma, which has to be fully followed.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:16.460
Now, I told, in India, that now you are all
become Sahajas.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:23.990
The story is like this, that there was a villager
who became a Christian.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.770
So he came down to Allahabad to become Christian.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:33.000
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name because now I am Saheb, I have

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.200
become an English man.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.280
So you better give me a big name."

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.360
They said, “What name you want?”

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.650
He said “Give me the name of Alexander the
Great!”

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.380
So they called him Alexander.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.740
But his name was Blondie, you see.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:49.780
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they called
him Alexander Bhoora.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.780
So Mr.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.190
Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and went
to the River Ganges for having his bath.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.020
So the priest said, the pastor, he said, “You
can’t do that!”

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.150
He said, “Why?

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.030
Why can’t I do that?”

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.340
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges because the Christianity

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.340
will drop out, you see!”

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.420
If he goes and has a bath in the River Ganges.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.680
He said, “This you can’t do!”

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:18.840
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb, I have become Englishman, that doesn’t

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.800
mean I have given up my religion!”

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800
You see!

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:30.520
This is exactly what is happening to us when
we try to follow any religion whatsoever.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.690
Now we are all identified with our so-called
religions in which we were born.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:40.180
For example, if I told Indians, “Now, you
don’t go to temples!

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:45.960
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple, unless and until you

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.560
have told me, don’t go to a swayambhu temple
at any cost."

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:58.070
There are many churches also where there are
very good statues, we can say, or have got

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:01.440
something which are really swayambhus, but
they are very few.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.430
So you tell me and then go.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:10.170
But they wouldn’t listen to me, they won’t
listen, and when they go there they catch

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.390
on their Agnyas.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:17.950
Once I went to see one temple which was of
course a swayambhu temple, no doubt, so some

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.350
Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.580
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.480
When they came back, as soon as they saw me,
they all fainted.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.480
I said, “What happened?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.510
Where did you go?”

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.570
“Oh, we went to this temple."

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.570
I said, “Why?

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.690
You never told me.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.994
And what do you have here [on your forehead]?”

00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:37.830
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka (bindi)
and it’s finished!

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.750
Then it took them one month to clear out!

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:46.490
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:53.370
Same with the Christians: now the other day
I heard about the Paris episode where people

00:26:53.370 --> 00:27:00.370
wanted to have weddings in the church, in
Paris.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.059
So they must have special dresses!

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:07.140
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from…what shop is that?

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.340
I forgot the name, some big name.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:16.940
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:22.650
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.560
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.180
What has happened is that in the church there
are many dead bodies buried, and they are

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.460
all caught up.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:40.250
So when you go also to see the beautiful architecture,
go with a detached mind.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.390
Don’t think that you belong to that church.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.510
You don’t belong to any church.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.610
You don’t belong to any temple.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.370
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:28:01.390
And I have to tell you today that Christ did
not belong to any religion.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.610
He didn’t follow any religion.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.840
He followed His own spiritual religion.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.870
When He went to one church where there were
people who were discussing, I mean they were

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.490
Jews, He went there and He was talking to
them.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:22.390
The other day I saw a beautiful painting they
had given on the newspaper, a very beautiful

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:28.150
famous painting where Christ is talking to
the doctors and He is holding His, rubbing

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:38.450
His Left Swadhishthana, very nicely, and all
the doctors, one of them is listening to Him,

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.190
one of them is looking at Him, sneering at
Him, another one is little bit paying attention

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.190
to Him.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.530
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.380
It’s clearly [shown].

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.100
You can see it so clearly!

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.612
And so now, with these new achievements, you
must rise above all these things and you must

00:28:56.612 --> 00:29:02.190
understand that we have to be very independently
looking at ourselves.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.920
We are no more belonging to any religion.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.150
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:19.100
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread
only when you really become nothing but Sahaj.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.490
But that’s something I don’t understand
— it doesn’t work out.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:30.540
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called ‘Hamaty’ or something

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:36.350
who was supposed to be an incarnation or something.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.660
His disciples absolutely, I should say that
they behave in such a manner that you can’t

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.540
believe it: how ardently they believe in this
man.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:52.340
Whatever he says, whatever he does, how they
believe in him.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.850
It’s very surprising.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:30:01.580
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone, you’ll be surprised the way they

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.270
are fanatic about this fellow and they will
not hear anything against.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:12.690
Leave alone that, but if he says, “You stand
on your head for the whole night,” they

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:13.721
will do it!

00:30:13.721 --> 00:30:18.860
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it, and when

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:26.910
we know the truth, this is the truth, then
we take advantage and we try to compromise.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:34.460
We think the truth will not do anything about
it.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.730
Not that truth will punish you, it will not,
because you are realised-souls.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.890
It will not.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.650
It will not punish you up to a point.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:51.790
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely working
at the same time.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:58.730
If we do anything wrong, like these people
went to the church, they were all caught up.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.300
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.570
We are Sahaj Yogis."

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:10.150
Because you are vulnerable, you are vulnerable.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.160
Yet you have not reached that stage.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.960
If you reach that stage, then when you go
there, all the church people will come out

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.730
of the church and run away.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.150
They’ll start shaking before you.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.750
They will not know what has happened.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:31.870
I have seen when I enter into any church all
the candles start going chuk, chuk, chuk,

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.520
chuk, chuk, chuk, and people start wondering
what has happened.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:41.710
Even when they are having a dinner or something
and there is a candlelight dinner I am surprised

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.940
the way every candle starts flickering and
people start looking.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.970
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see, so the candles immediately show that

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.770
these are the bhoots sitting here.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:59.370
With all this knowledge that you have, the
light you have within yourself, by which you

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.990
are enlightened, still if you are going to
these left and right-sided things, it’s

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.799
very, very dangerous.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:13.520
We see that also, today, I must tell you about
the part that is politics.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.860
In politics also these people have developed
two types of theories: one is left-sided,

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.309
one right-sided.

00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:25.270
The left-sided theories are democratic, where
you can indulge into anything you like.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.870
It’s the individual that is important.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:32.910
The individual indulges into everything and
you should not stop him from doing whatever

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.910
he likes, he’s an individual: so he has
a right to cut his nose, he has a right to

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:40.820
cut his eyes, to do what he likes.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:48.360
An individual is allowed to do what he likes
to do, and then what happens [is] that we

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:54.320
find this democracy becomes a demonocracy:
everybody is a demon.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:02.990
Everybody is busy cutting throats, cutting
all the basis and the roots of life because

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:08.800
everybody is Brahma, becomes a great personality,
because the individual is so great and the

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.600
collective is lost, completely lost.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:21.280
But on the other side, where it is more discipline,
more aggressiveness, more controls and everything

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.410
[with] the Right Side, which we can call as
communism, where people are controlled all

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:27.730
the time.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:28.730
Now why?

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.710
Because for the collective the individual
must sacrifice.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:38.070
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak, then the

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:41.490
collective cannot be strong: it cannot be
strong.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.360
The individuals have to be strong.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:50.100
For example, you will see that the people
who come from communist countries, they drink

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.340
more than people who can drink here.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.799
Or those who come, say from Islamic countries,
where they don’t touch anything, can drink

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:01.070
more than even sardarjees.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:07.200
So you can imagine what is the situation of
human beings is that, out of fear if you try

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.520
to control him, he goes to the Right Side.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:19.409
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed, he doesn’t accept the situation,

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:25.830
he doesn’t become that, he doesn’t have
that power to control himself.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:30.690
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.030
He’s still there.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.980
As soon as he gets a chance he falls into
it.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.560
So that fails.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.310
So the individuals are weak in that case.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:47.320
And where there is complete abandonment, do
what you like, live the way you like, indulgences,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.869
all kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:55.540
I mean, everyday you see and you say, “Oh
God, this is a decadent society, this is happening!”

00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:02.450
Decadence is because an individual [to] whom
you have given all these powers, has no power

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:03.540
to bear them.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.100
An individual cannot bear money.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.310
He cannot bear power of any kind.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.230
He cannot bear love.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.550
He cannot bear kindness.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:22.960
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:30.220
But when an individual becomes the collective
— this is the ascent through the central

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:40.370
path — when he becomes the collective, in
his strength he strengthens the collective.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:46.520
And also the collective looks after, protects,
and guides the individual.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.430
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:54.710
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:36:05.250
And there where we feel that still we are
something great, we are different, we are

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:13.200
Indians or we are from England or from France,
still if you are identified then you are not

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.840
collective.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:20.930
In collective sense we are all one, part and
parcel of one being.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:26.520
Then you are really acting as collective being
and you are one with the Divine.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.869
Where the Sun is looking after you, the Moon
is looking after you, the winds are looking

00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:38.520
after you; all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:47.250
Ether, everything is working for you and you
are so well-protected and blessed by the special

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:51.080
quality to enjoy the joy.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:57.520
Then you really become sensitive to that joy,
when you are one with the whole.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.340
Like if supposing this finger or this finger
is not one with the whole, is numbed out…as

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.350
it happens in leprosy, what happens that this
finger becomes numbed out.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:18.390
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know
because there is no connection, no nerves

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.460
acting, it’s insensitive.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:28.000
In the same way if you are not collective
and not bothered about collective you are

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.770
going to be dropped out.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:40.080
You are not going to be there to enjoy the
beauties of your own glory and that of the

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.640
collective.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:47.580
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves, we have to ascend and we

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.000
have to be collective.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.240
It’s very easy to find out faults with others.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.700
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:01.000
Very easy also to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.730
Better find faults with yourself.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.440
The rest I’ll look after.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:13.340
First you just find faults with yourself and
try to understand others and love others and

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.220
enjoy the company of others.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:24.550
This, once you decide that we have to enjoy,
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:31.520
Just this decision, this faith, within you
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.430
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:41.420
Just this decision itself will give you the
power to enjoy.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:49.380
But the decision should be firm, no hypocrisy,
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:55.970
nothing, just pure desire within us that we
have to be the Spirit.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:00.300
And the Spirit which is the collective being
within us.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:09.910
I hope today on this day of resurrection,
we have to be thankful to Christ very much

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:23.050
for showing us the way and also we have to
be very much concerned and alerted about ourselves:

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.450
Where are we?

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.310
Where do we stand?

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.970
What are we up to?

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.070
What are we doing?

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.080
What is our responsibility?

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.990
What is expected of us?

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.830
Why all these blessings are given to us?

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:41.240
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga, no sacrifice.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:49.630
Nobody wants you anything to commit or to
do or membership or anything like that.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.350
I think it’s my commitment.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:40:00.850
As I said, that God has the commitment but
you also have one commitment that your desire

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:01.850
should be pure.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.450
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.990
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out."

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.740
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and that’s
what He achieved.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.820
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.869
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday.

00:40:19.869 --> 00:40:27.590
Now imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age
and at this age most of the ladies, you see,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:33.480
just, I don’t know what they do.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.480
(laughter)

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:46.030
So now you must come up and work out everything
as far as possible, thinking that we all have

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.030
to stand up.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.810
Now the children are coming up.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.870
They are also going to stand up.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.740
You are all looking younger to me and younger
to me.

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.750
Every day I see you, you look younger.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.700
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you, the
way you look younger and I think, is he the

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:07.840
son or is he the father?

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:16.420
The situation is such that you are all blessed:
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.830
And everybody tells me, “Mother, this is
what has happened, that has happened!” everything.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.230
Now, so what?

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:25.080
These are temptations, be careful.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.849
This is not what you wanted.

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:35.460
What you wanted is the state of that complete
faith within yourself where you don’t have

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:41.670
to ask, nothing — everything will work out.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:42.670
It works!

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.790
That’s [what] the point is.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:54.230
So, I hope next time when we meet I’ll see
even younger people than what I see today

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.360
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.800
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.340
He was very young, I must say.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:08.660
But how much He has done for humanity.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:12.530
Nobody could have achieved that much in that
small age as He has done it.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.670
It’s remarkable!

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.380
It’s really remarkable!

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.590
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:25.710
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.500
And today is the day of certain promises.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.870
May God bless you for that.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.130
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
