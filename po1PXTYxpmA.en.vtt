00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:55.578
1992-1017 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

00:04:56.524 --> 00:05:01.250
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:05:08.363 --> 00:05:18.025
At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:35.694
We cannot transform it, change it, and even think about it;

00:05:41.264 --> 00:05:50.034
unfortunately at this human awareness, we cannot even feel it.

00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:59.023
You have been already told about the subtle system

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:03.607
we have within ourselves.

00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:12.745
This subtle system works out your ascent.

00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:23.255
Whatever I am telling you today you need not accept blindfold.

00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:33.815
But if it is proved, treat it as a hypothesis

00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:41.226
and if it is true then you have to accept it as honestly.

00:06:49.622 --> 00:06:55.351
Because it is for the benevolence of you

00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:58.658
and for the benevolence of your country

00:06:58.858 --> 00:07:03.444
and for the benevolence of this world.

00:07:09.434 --> 00:07:15.436
It is the last breakthrough of our evolution into a new awareness

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:20.472
that we become the Spirit.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:31.997
The first thing you should know that we are not this body,

00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:36.522
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:41.823
but we are the pure Spirit.

00:07:51.102 --> 00:07:53.426
And the another truth is that

00:07:53.626 --> 00:08:00.723
there is this all pervading power

00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:04.899
of divine love

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:09.528
which does all the living work.

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:16.764
You see these beautiful flowers, its a miracle.

00:08:20.802 --> 00:08:28.402
And you see your own eyes,

00:08:28.602 --> 00:08:32.766
what a camera!

00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:41.418
And this brain, what a computer.

00:08:42.668 --> 00:08:46.534
But we take everything for granted.

00:08:49.846 --> 00:08:52.920
If you ask doctor who runs our heart

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.244
he will say it’s a autonomous nervous system.

00:09:03.478 --> 00:09:08.283
But who is this auto?

00:09:08.806 --> 00:09:13.176
There is a power, which is a living power,

00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:18.312
which does all this living work.

00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:27.761
This is the power of divine love

00:09:31.241 --> 00:09:36.019
and this love is the truth.

00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:47.405
The first thing is to become the Spirit,

00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:54.064
and the second is to feel,

00:09:54.264 --> 00:10:00.472
to feel the all pervading power of divine love.

00:10:04.394 --> 00:10:08.503
This is not just a lecture

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.977
- or a sermon... - Sorry?

00:10:13.177 --> 00:10:16.294
or a sermon.

00:10:16.494 --> 00:10:26.384
But it is to tell you that you all have your divinity intact.

00:10:31.579 --> 00:10:37.294
Your divinity cannot be destroyed.

00:10:37.494 --> 00:10:41.560
It cannot be tarnished.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:48.907
Whatever you might have done, your divinity is eternal.

00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:57.148
So the question is only how to manifest that divinity.

00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:08.019
When this power, which you call as Kundalini, rises,

00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:10.534
she passes through six centres,

00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:14.050
ultimately breaks through the seventh centre

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.378
which we call as the fontanelle bone area.

00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:36.560
So this the actualization of your baptism.

00:11:37.721 --> 00:11:42.029
It is not the false certificate.

00:11:42.229 --> 00:11:51.980
This power, kundalini power, is the reflection of the holy ghost.

00:11:56.438 --> 00:12:01.204
Holy ghost is no more a mystery.

00:12:04.437 --> 00:12:08.104
When we talk about the God almighty,

00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:16.255
and about the son, then what about the mother?

00:12:22.137 --> 00:12:27.141
Mother is a dove, is the holy ghost.

00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:33.014
It is (inaudible), is the primordial mother,

00:12:33.223 --> 00:12:37.333
which is the holy ghost.

00:12:38.597 --> 00:12:42.366
In Greece she is called as Athena

00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:47.635
and in India it is called as the Adi Shakti.

00:12:52.643 --> 00:13:00.895
In Gospel of Thomas, Thomas has written that Christ said that

00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:04.012
"this is the mother who conceived me.

00:13:04.212 --> 00:13:08.279
But I have one Great Mother,

00:13:16.372 --> 00:13:22.129
and when she is with the father, I am also with her."

00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:30.556
So there was a primordial mother.

00:13:30.756 --> 00:13:37.641
But there is no prayer in the bible also,

00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:42.443
there is no praise of the Mother of Christ.

00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:57.784
They did not even say that she was a Goddess

00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:04.279
or she was Madonna.

00:14:04.479 --> 00:14:09.161
It was the Pagan religion which was before Christianity

00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:14.697
which influenced people and this formerly religion.

00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:24.183
It seems Paul hated women

00:14:24.383 --> 00:14:29.407
and he did not want their place in the bible at all.

00:14:35.148 --> 00:14:39.011
And he does not, also now they don’t permit women

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:43.594
to have the position of priest.

00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:52.440
But not in the in the Indian Scriptures,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:15:00.299
Primordial Mother is reflected as kundalini in us.

00:15:05.557 --> 00:15:11.411
And the God almighty is reflected in our heart as Spirit.

00:15:15.192 --> 00:15:21.367
Now when this kundalini rises, you will be amazed to see

00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:26.695
that she automatically cures

00:15:26.895 --> 00:15:33.931
your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:48.276
It’s a fact that many diseases have been cured.

00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:52.914
There are three doctors in India,

00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:58.114
who have now got MD in Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:08.499
for curing incurable diseases.

00:16:12.422 --> 00:16:16.543
So when this kundalini is traveling through the centres,

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:20.759
she nourishes them, she integrates them

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:26.193
and she connects you to this all pervading power.

00:16:39.314 --> 00:16:44.931
First of all you feel absolutely peaceful

00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:53.573
because when she passes through your this (Agnya) centre,

00:16:53.773 --> 00:17:03.671
she breaks the thoughts and between the thought, there is a pause.

00:17:13.176 --> 00:17:16.413
Your mind is jumping on the cusp of thoughts,

00:17:16.613 --> 00:17:20.785
coming from the past or present.

00:17:31.938 --> 00:17:39.132
So, when the kundalini rises

00:17:39.804 --> 00:17:44.786
then these thoughts from the past and the future separate

00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:51.268
and between there is a pause, that is the present.

00:17:59.844 --> 00:18:07.445
And in the present you don’t think, there is no thought.

00:18:09.594 --> 00:18:14.106
So you receive your peaceful status.

00:18:19.236 --> 00:18:24.408
You are aware, fully aware but you are thoughtless.

00:18:28.393 --> 00:18:30.576
If you want to think, you can think,

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:36.276
if you don’t want to think you can be at peace with yourself.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.975
The second stage where this connection with all pervading power

00:18:49.175 --> 00:18:53.221
is fully established, then you receive another awareness

00:18:53.422 --> 00:18:58.219
which you call as doubtless awareness.

00:19:09.332 --> 00:19:16.733
In that state, in that state, you become powerful enough

00:19:16.933 --> 00:19:21.066
to give realization to others.

00:19:26.763 --> 00:19:30.071
You can cure others.

00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:34.365
And your personality emits peace.

00:19:39.198 --> 00:19:42.514
The nature of Spirit

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:48.482
which once come into your attention

00:19:48.682 --> 00:19:53.072
enlightens the attention.

00:19:59.451 --> 00:20:03.845
When the attention is enlightened,

00:20:04.045 --> 00:20:08.654
then your attention becomes active.

00:20:11.888 --> 00:20:18.350
And the attention which is enlightened,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:30.014
can activate in another person this benevolence.

00:20:40.454 --> 00:20:44.704
This attention becomes innocent.

00:20:46.818 --> 00:20:52.888
Christ has said, thou shall not have adulterous eyes.

00:20:57.413 --> 00:21:03.600
How many Christian have eyes which are innocent?

00:21:07.157 --> 00:21:11.594
Devoid of lust and greed?

00:21:14.422 --> 00:21:26.032
But only after your self realization your eyes start sparkling,

00:21:26.232 --> 00:21:31.077
and they become absolutely innocent.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.183
And they become so powerful

00:21:39.383 --> 00:21:43.363
that even a glance of such a person

00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:48.808
can do so much good to another one.

00:21:57.618 --> 00:22:06.579
The second great point about Spirit is that it is a universal being.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.367
In a way, we are universal also.

00:22:16.696 --> 00:22:20.618
If you cut here (any finger) of anyone,

00:22:20.819 --> 00:22:24.661
you will find the same nerve, the same artery,

00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:29.258
the same vessel, the same blood.

00:22:36.127 --> 00:22:40.221
So our differences is only skin deep.

00:22:43.806 --> 00:22:46.991
But Spirit mean the universal being.

00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:54.105
When it comes into your attention, you become an universal being.

00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:07.998
Then automatically you transcend all barriers, of caste,

00:23:08.198 --> 00:23:16.089
of religion, of country, races; everything automatically.

00:23:23.456 --> 00:23:27.704
Sahaja yoga is working in 55 nations

00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:35.796
and we have thousands and thousands of sahaja yogis.

00:23:37.544 --> 00:23:41.474
They come to India for a seminar,

00:23:43.497 --> 00:23:45.813
I have never seen them fighting,

00:23:46.013 --> 00:23:49.798
quarreling

00:23:51.884 --> 00:23:55.634
on any point whatsoever.

00:23:56.287 --> 00:24:04.928
Because Spirit is the source of the absolute truth.

00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:13.537
We live on a relative world.

00:24:15.157 --> 00:24:19.199
There are so many dogmas,

00:24:19.399 --> 00:24:22.738
there are so many theories,

00:24:22.938 --> 00:24:26.564
so many ideas,

00:24:26.764 --> 00:24:35.857
but once you become the Spirit, all of you see the same thing.

00:24:40.622 --> 00:24:48.445
Supposing you have ten people, children, whose eyes are tied,

00:24:48.645 --> 00:24:54.161
and you ask them who is this man? What is he suffering from?

00:25:02.688 --> 00:25:06.888
They will all raise one finger, say like this.

00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:12.630
Then you ask that man, are you suffering

00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:16.667
from some heart trouble?

00:25:20.965 --> 00:25:24.840
He said "yes, but how do you know?".

00:25:26.456 --> 00:25:33.878
Because this finger decodes heart trouble.

00:25:39.366 --> 00:25:44.030
So on your fingertips you will know the truth.

00:25:48.281 --> 00:25:53.105
These days there are many false gurus, prophets,

00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:57.490
coming also from India.

00:26:01.732 --> 00:26:09.946
They are only money oriented or power oriented.

00:26:14.118 --> 00:26:18.737
They can show some sort of a miracle of giving you

00:26:18.937 --> 00:26:23.788
a Swiss watch or something like that

00:26:30.244 --> 00:26:34.385
or some rich people diamonds also.

00:26:39.282 --> 00:26:42.152
Those who believe in such things

00:26:42.352 --> 00:26:47.835
cannot believe in God almighty.

00:26:52.983 --> 00:26:58.201
Because for God all these things are dust.

00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:05.529
He doesn’t understand money.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.585
Even the religions have become power oriented or money oriented.

00:27:16.864 --> 00:27:21.903
They are not Spirit oriented, as they should be.

00:27:25.668 --> 00:27:30.161
This is the reason why we have deviated

00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:35.923
from the real religion which was started.

00:27:41.845 --> 00:27:48.395
All religions were started by real people.

00:27:52.614 --> 00:27:58.558
They were like flowers on the same tree of life.

00:28:02.144 --> 00:28:05.746
But we plucked it

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:12.485
and now we are fighting with dead flowers.

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:20.412
How can you fight in the name of God?

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.536
It is illogical.

00:28:31.162 --> 00:28:39.819
So the Spirit is the source of all the knowledge,

00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:44.851
which is pure knowledge.

00:28:50.109 --> 00:28:55.110
All whatever I am saying is absolutely tangible,

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:59.904
can be proved,

00:29:02.771 --> 00:29:10.419
can be tested. It is scientific, but it is a meta-science.

00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:17.307
Meta-science.

00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:22.862
Because the science is a knowledge, say,

00:29:23.062 --> 00:29:27.458
of the tree that has grown out,

00:29:31.423 --> 00:29:35.337
but this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.403
And if you know the knowledge of the roots,

00:29:40.603 --> 00:29:44.994
it’s very simple and fundamental.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:57.842
Above all, Spirit is the source of joy.

00:30:01.958 --> 00:30:07.129
It does not have the duality of happiness and unhappiness.

00:30:10.756 --> 00:30:14.842
It is a singular thing

00:30:16.178 --> 00:30:22.156
which you can enjoy but cannot describe.

00:30:26.656 --> 00:30:31.980
All this divinity is within you, all of you;

00:30:35.652 --> 00:30:40.245
and nothing is lost.

00:30:40.445 --> 00:30:44.828
You have to just understand that

00:30:45.028 --> 00:30:50.555
you all can get your Self-Realization tonight.

00:30:58.172 --> 00:31:01.957
First of all, I have to tell you that

00:31:02.158 --> 00:31:06.674
I cannot force self knowledge on you.

00:31:12.697 --> 00:31:16.798
You'll become a collective being,

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:22.479
by which you know the problems of others.

00:31:25.237 --> 00:31:29.732
And you should know that most of the problems of this world

00:31:29.932 --> 00:31:34.471
are because of human beings.

00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:43.308
And most of the human problems are because of these centres.

00:31:46.277 --> 00:31:50.152
Now if you have centres put right,

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:55.558
then all the problems are solved.

00:31:56.511 --> 00:32:00.438
There cannot be any war,

00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:06.242
there cannot be any quarrel about anything.

00:32:08.469 --> 00:32:15.213
Also when you are blessed by this all pervading power,

00:32:15.413 --> 00:32:19.748
you have many other powers also.

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:35.071
Like the agriculture, your country can prosper ten times more.

00:32:38.073 --> 00:32:41.181
All living process is expedited.

00:32:41.382 --> 00:32:42.436
Sorry, Sheri Mataji.

00:32:42.637 --> 00:32:46.741
All living process will be expedited.

00:32:48.897 --> 00:32:53.019
All this sounds very fantastic.

00:32:53.534 --> 00:32:56.959
But you are fantastic.

00:32:57.159 --> 00:33:03.879
Because you are not yet connected, you don’t know what you are.

00:33:07.184 --> 00:33:09.708
As this (mike) instrument when it is not connected,

00:33:09.908 --> 00:33:14.048
it has no meaning.

00:33:16.837 --> 00:33:21.182
So this connection is to be established.

00:33:23.455 --> 00:33:27.927
Again I would say those who do not want to have Self-Realization

00:33:28.127 --> 00:33:32.510
should leave the hall because it cannot be forced.

00:33:40.497 --> 00:33:44.561
I respect your freedom.

00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:50.565
Christ has said, the meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:33:54.317 --> 00:33:59.184
So sahaja yoga is not meant for arrogant people,

00:34:02.027 --> 00:34:09.087
nor it is meant for stupid people and idiotic people.

00:34:09.288 --> 00:34:16.390
It is meant for people who really desire to have the higher life.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:25.310
You have to have a very pure desire.

00:34:29.312 --> 00:34:31.416
So again I would request you

00:34:31.616 --> 00:34:34.752
those who do not want to have their Self-Realization,

00:34:34.952 --> 00:34:39.341
should leave the hall.

00:34:43.568 --> 00:34:47.607
It will hardly take ten minutes.

00:34:49.172 --> 00:34:52.641
It will hardly take ten minutes.

00:34:54.376 --> 00:34:59.034
Please sit down, please be seated all of you.

00:35:18.692 --> 00:35:21.859
I am very happy to see there are so many seekers

00:35:22.059 --> 00:35:26.286
of truth in Rio de Janeiro.

00:35:31.299 --> 00:35:35.068
I have been traveling South America

00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:39.406
and this is the last program I have.

00:35:46.148 --> 00:35:50.057
And everywhere there are one thousand of people

00:35:50.257 --> 00:35:54.194
who have got their realization.

00:35:57.763 --> 00:36:01.794
First thing you don’t have to pay for it.

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:09.074
It is invaluable.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:17.285
And I have told you that God does not understand money or banking.

00:36:21.752 --> 00:36:27.543
So today when you have your realization,

00:36:27.743 --> 00:36:33.907
please remember that this is the collective happening.

00:36:39.171 --> 00:36:44.703
You have to come to our collective centre

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:53.904
so that this connection is properly established.

00:36:56.364 --> 00:37:02.869
You don’t have to fast, or suffer, or go to Himalayas.

00:37:05.549 --> 00:37:09.908
Christ has already suffered for us.

00:37:11.087 --> 00:37:15.267
Are you going to suffer more than he has suffered?

00:37:17.143 --> 00:37:22.588
So all these theories of suffering is all nonsense.

00:37:28.618 --> 00:37:38.358
In short you should be very pleasantly placed to yourself.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:49.543
Because you are human beings, epitome of evolution.

00:37:53.215 --> 00:38:02.047
And a little more journey you are going to be in the kingdom of God.

00:38:05.389 --> 00:38:09.951
Now there are three very simple conditions.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:18.790
The first on is that you have to be fully self-confident

00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:23.831
that you will get your realization.

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:34.919
Full-confident.

00:38:35.143 --> 00:38:41.555
It follows them that don't condemn yourself for anything.

00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:46.906
It follows that don't condemn yourself or anything.

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:57.221
You are not to feel guilty at all for anything.

00:38:58.237 --> 00:39:01.464
After all, you have done committed mistakes,

00:39:01.665 --> 00:39:06.448
you are human beings, you are not God.

00:39:09.374 --> 00:39:14.351
And this All-Pervading Power is the ocean of forgiveness

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:18.958
and whatever mistakes you might have committed

00:39:24.764 --> 00:39:29.633
it dissolves everything.

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:35.068
So please don't feel guilty because the center of the left hand side here,

00:39:35.292 --> 00:39:40.401
this one, gets ruining by feeling guilty.

00:39:48.554 --> 00:39:52.827
Even physically you suffer.

00:39:54.421 --> 00:40:02.717
Either you get angina or spondylitis or many heart problems.

00:40:10.292 --> 00:40:15.381
So what is the need to feel guilty?

00:40:16.006 --> 00:40:21.061
Why should you punish yourself for nothing at all?

00:40:22.303 --> 00:40:28.373
So just now please please tell yourself: "I am not guilty at all".

00:40:32.047 --> 00:40:39.659
Now, the second condition is that -

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:44.070
this is the second one I said, don't feel guilty, the third one

00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:49.779
is that you have to forgive everyone.

00:40:53.476 --> 00:40:58.439
Now, they say it is very difficult,

00:40:58.655 --> 00:41:05.280
but logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do?

00:41:09.313 --> 00:41:12.352
You don't do anything.

00:41:12.561 --> 00:41:17.446
But when you don't forgive you play into wrong hands

00:41:20.176 --> 00:41:25.355
those who have harmed you

00:41:25.556 --> 00:41:29.308
are happy people.

00:41:29.509 --> 00:41:35.720
And those people like you

00:41:35.921 --> 00:41:40.372
who are suffering are playing into their hands.

00:41:46.388 --> 00:41:50.973
But at this time specially, the center of the Agnya, this one,

00:41:51.174 --> 00:41:55.434
the optic chiasma is like this, closed.

00:42:01.893 --> 00:42:05.213
Now, if you have to open this, you have to forgive,

00:42:05.414 --> 00:42:09.835
otherwise it will be like this, constricted.

00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:18.472
It won't open.

00:42:18.673 --> 00:42:22.485
As it is, you have tortured yourself all your life,

00:42:22.686 --> 00:42:27.719
and now if you don't forgive, this will not open

00:42:33.042 --> 00:42:39.221
and you will miss this great opportunity of getting self-realization.

00:42:42.612 --> 00:42:47.580
So when you forgive, it opens like this.

00:42:50.065 --> 00:42:54.838
So don't even think about those people.

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.815
It is a headache.

00:43:00.016 --> 00:43:03.932
In general, you should say: "I forgive everyone".

00:43:07.998 --> 00:43:10.998
That is the best way

00:43:11.199 --> 00:43:14.808
that you will get your self-realization.

00:43:17.113 --> 00:43:20.206
You have to seat very comfortably,

00:43:20.407 --> 00:43:25.282
not in any asana or anything, in a very simple way,

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.548
without any tension.

00:43:32.749 --> 00:43:36.852
[Shri Mataji talks to a man that is sitting in a funny way]

00:43:50.651 --> 00:43:56.916
You have to just take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:44:09.572 --> 00:44:13.386
And relax.

00:44:13.587 --> 00:44:17.899
No tension.

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:23.434
You have to seat comfortably in your chair.

00:44:25.442 --> 00:44:29.785
Sitting on your chair, you will get your Realization.

00:44:34.114 --> 00:44:36.973
Now you have to put both feet apart each other,

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:40.361
those who are sitting on the chairs,

00:44:40.562 --> 00:44:44.901
otherwise who are sitting on the ground are perfectly alright.

00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:59.700
Sitting in a sanyasi, say, in a sanya sanasi, you say, called it, without any a...

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.990
Relax, relax your legs.

00:45:12.191 --> 00:45:14.952
It is not the right way.

00:45:15.163 --> 00:45:18.788
Tell him, tell him, relax, relax.

00:45:29.384 --> 00:45:31.581
Spread out, spread out.

00:45:31.782 --> 00:45:33.847
Now both the feet are away from each other.

00:45:34.048 --> 00:45:36.672
No, no, it is alright.

00:45:36.873 --> 00:45:40.550
On the ground, you can also seat like this, it is alright.

00:45:40.751 --> 00:45:45.542
Not necessary for you, you can, this gentleman, no the another one.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:50.907
Yes, sit comfortably, be comfortable.

00:45:59.472 --> 00:46:04.692
Now first thing, we will show you.

00:46:04.893 --> 00:46:10.846
We will show you how you will nourish your own centers.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:28.858
Please just focus it and then you have to close your eyes.

00:46:33.705 --> 00:46:37.674
First you have to put your left hand on your lap,

00:46:37.893 --> 00:46:42.564
left hand on your left lap comfortably.

00:46:47.244 --> 00:46:52.126
Please put both your legs apart from each others.

00:46:56.321 --> 00:47:03.595
Now, please remember this left hand suggests

00:47:03.796 --> 00:47:09.100
your desire to have your self-realization.

00:47:14.497 --> 00:47:17.809
Now, the right hand, you are going to use it

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:22.486
to nourish our centers on the left hand side.

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:31.299
So we put our right hand on our heart first.

00:47:34.378 --> 00:47:38.565
In the heart resides the Spirit,

00:47:40.237 --> 00:47:45.041
which is the reflexion of God Almighty.

00:47:48.042 --> 00:47:53.838
Now, if you become the Spirit, you become your own master.

00:47:57.918 --> 00:48:05.222
So now, you take your right hand in upper portion of your abdomen

00:48:05.423 --> 00:48:09.540
on the left hand side.

00:48:14.322 --> 00:48:19.188
This is the center of your mastery.

00:48:19.767 --> 00:48:23.915
Later all you will know everything about it.

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:29.759
You don't have to pay for that knowledge.

00:48:31.423 --> 00:48:34.392
Now you put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:48:34.593 --> 00:48:38.181
on the left hand side.

00:48:42.081 --> 00:48:47.909
This is the center of Pure Divine Knowledge.

00:48:51.373 --> 00:48:59.365
Now, raise your hand again back onto the

00:48:59.566 --> 00:49:04.160
upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:49:10.882 --> 00:49:16.725
Now, raise your right hand on the heart.

00:49:19.572 --> 00:49:21.572
Now you have to take your right hand

00:49:21.773 --> 00:49:26.259
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

00:49:30.591 --> 00:49:35.263
And turn your head to your right.

00:49:37.573 --> 00:49:42.370
I've already told you what happens

00:49:42.571 --> 00:49:46.690
when this center is out of gear.

00:49:51.087 --> 00:49:56.641
Now please, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

00:49:56.842 --> 00:50:00.599
and put down your head.

00:50:05.043 --> 00:50:11.925
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone in general.

00:50:14.994 --> 00:50:18.642
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head.

00:50:23.745 --> 00:50:28.236
And push back your head as far as possible.

00:50:30.862 --> 00:50:37.463
Here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes,

00:50:37.664 --> 00:50:43.453
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

00:50:51.165 --> 00:50:56.477
Now the last center, just watch,

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:02.813
Stretch your palm fully.

00:51:06.157 --> 00:51:11.688
Now put the center of your palm on top of fontanelle bone area

00:51:11.889 --> 00:51:19.482
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:51:28.072 --> 00:51:33.095
Now please put down your head as far as you can.

00:51:34.744 --> 00:51:40.736
Now the important thing is to stretch down your fingers as far as possible.

00:51:46.456 --> 00:51:51.510
So that there is a good pressure on your scalp.

00:51:54.901 --> 00:51:59.284
Now please move

00:51:59.492 --> 00:52:05.991
your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

00:52:08.974 --> 00:52:13.997
Please take down your hands.

00:52:16.966 --> 00:52:21.864
That is all we have to do.

00:52:32.118 --> 00:52:34.508
Now you all have to close your eyes

00:52:34.709 --> 00:52:39.164
and please don't open till I tell you.

00:52:43.707 --> 00:52:47.275
So put your left hand on your lap, left side

00:52:47.476 --> 00:52:52.061
and right hand on your heart, both feet apart.

00:52:58.872 --> 00:53:04.684
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question.

00:53:10.008 --> 00:53:14.406
Three times in your heart.

00:53:14.607 --> 00:53:19.341
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.060
"Mother, Am I the Spirit?

00:53:26.261 --> 00:53:31.193
Ask this question three times in your heart.

00:53:44.108 --> 00:53:49.389
I've told you that if you become the Spirit,

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:53.869
you become your own master.

00:53:59.261 --> 00:54:01.318
So now, please take your right hand

00:54:01.519 --> 00:54:06.581
on the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

00:54:11.038 --> 00:54:15.819
Here you have to ask another fundamental question.

00:54:17.968 --> 00:54:23.554
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:54:51.257 --> 00:54:55.179
I have to again tell you that I cannot force

00:54:55.380 --> 00:55:02.589
the Pure Divine Knowledge on you, you have to ask for it.

00:55:10.235 --> 00:55:13.837
So please take your right hand

00:55:14.038 --> 00:55:18.670
in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:55:22.663 --> 00:55:30.068
and here you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals.

00:55:35.282 --> 00:55:44.618
Please ask six times: "Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge".

00:55:55.105 --> 00:56:02.371
As soon as you ask for the Divine Knowledge

00:56:02.572 --> 00:56:07.384
the Kundalini starts rising.

00:56:14.109 --> 00:56:20.929
So we have to nourish our upper centers with our full self-confidence.

00:56:27.012 --> 00:56:29.012
So now please raise your right hand

00:56:29.213 --> 00:56:32.356
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:56:32.557 --> 00:56:36.916
and press it hard.

00:56:39.463 --> 00:56:49.027
Now here you have to say with full confidence ten times:

00:56:49.228 --> 00:56:53.957
"Mother, I am my own master".

00:57:14.768 --> 00:57:18.611
I've already told you that the fundamental fact about you

00:57:18.812 --> 00:57:24.320
is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

00:57:24.521 --> 00:57:28.746
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:57:39.186 --> 00:57:47.138
So now please leave your right hand onto your heart

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:55.521
and here with full confidence, please say twelve times:

00:57:55.722 --> 00:58:01.870
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit".

00:58:16.006 --> 00:58:21.224
This All-Pervading Power of Divine Love

00:58:21.425 --> 00:58:26.346
is the ocean of knowledge.

00:58:30.775 --> 00:58:38.600
It is the ocean of compassion and peace.

00:58:41.169 --> 00:58:45.296
It is a ocean of miracles

00:58:45.504 --> 00:58:50.512
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:58:52.052 --> 00:58:56.130
Whatever mistakes you might have commuted can be easily dissolve

00:58:56.331 --> 00:59:02.213
by the power of this ocean of compassion.

00:59:12.587 --> 00:59:18.253
So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand in the corner

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:24.726
of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.

00:59:32.815 --> 00:59:42.732
Here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times:

00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:48.707
"Mother, I am not guilty at all".

01:00:18.518 --> 01:00:25.003
I've already told you that whether you forgive or you don't forgive

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:29.708
you don't do anything.

01:00:32.832 --> 01:00:37.520
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:00:40.527 --> 01:00:43.433
Specially at this time if you don't forgive,

01:00:43.634 --> 01:00:48.675
this constricted Agnya Chakra won't open.

01:00:53.912 --> 01:00:58.701
So I request you that please raise your right hand

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:04.060
on top of your forehead and put down your head.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:15.128
And I have to request you to say from your heart not how many times:

01:01:15.329 --> 01:01:20.899
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general".

01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:47.223
Now take your right hand on the back side of your head

01:01:47.424 --> 01:01:52.269
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:02:00.356 --> 01:02:03.723
Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:02:03.924 --> 01:02:09.043
just for your satisfaction, you have to say:

01:02:20.193 --> 01:02:29.708
"Mother, oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me".

01:02:42.013 --> 01:02:45.789
Just for your satisfaction, you have to say from your heart,

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:50.337
not how many times.

01:02:58.306 --> 01:03:02.766
Now the last center.

01:03:03.306 --> 01:03:08.360
Please stretch your hand fully.

01:03:12.939 --> 01:03:21.110
And put the center of your palm on the fontanelle bone area.

01:03:25.418 --> 01:03:32.675
Please put down your head and remember to stretch back your fingers.

01:03:36.973 --> 01:03:43.207
Here again I cannot force Self-Realization on you,

01:03:43.408 --> 01:03:47.449
you have to ask for it.

01:03:52.106 --> 01:03:57.907
So move your scalp seven times clockwise saying:

01:03:58.108 --> 01:04:03.899
"Mother, please give me Self-Realization".

01:04:44.861 --> 01:04:49.368
Now please take down your hand.

01:04:52.205 --> 01:04:57.368
And open your eyes please, put on your glasses.

01:05:00.416 --> 01:05:06.657
Now please put both the hands like this towards Me.

01:05:11.222 --> 01:05:16.651
Now put right hand like this, bend your head

01:05:16.852 --> 01:05:24.896
and see with your left hand if there is a warm or hot or a cool breeze

01:05:25.113 --> 01:05:31.925
like waves coming out of your fontanelle bone area, bend your head.

01:05:49.201 --> 01:05:55.975
Now please don't doubt, put the left hand towards Me.

01:05:59.373 --> 01:06:02.646
And bend your head again and see with your right hand

01:06:02.855 --> 01:06:10.175
if there is a cool breeze coming out your head, may be warm or hot.

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:24.148
Some people get it close to their head and some away.

01:06:29.609 --> 01:06:35.702
If it is hot that means you have not forgiven, so please forgive.

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:49.992
Now, please put again your right hand towards Me.

01:06:52.873 --> 01:06:57.028
And put down your head.

01:06:57.229 --> 01:07:02.689
And see with the left hand again.

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:18.100
Don't put hand on your head, away from.

01:07:24.493 --> 01:07:29.110
Now, please put both the hands towards Me like this.

01:07:31.853 --> 01:07:37.071
And just don't think, you can do it.

01:07:44.889 --> 01:07:52.666
Now all those who have felt hot, warm or cool breeze

01:07:52.867 --> 01:08:00.072
on the fingertips or on the palm or out of fontanelle bone area,

01:08:00.273 --> 01:08:04.726
please raise both your hands.

01:08:18.686 --> 01:08:25.099
All of you have got it. This is Rio de Janeiro. May God bless you.

01:08:30.033 --> 01:08:35.174
Such spiritual people here.

01:08:35.893 --> 01:08:38.791
This is the All-Pervading Power.

01:08:38.992 --> 01:08:44.796
Now you can put up your hands and ask a question.

01:08:49.422 --> 01:08:54.211
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:08:56.438 --> 01:09:01.172
"Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holly Ghost?"

01:09:04.672 --> 01:09:12.289
"Mother, is this the All-Pervading Divine Power?"

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:19.977
Or "Mother, is this the Paramchaitania?"

01:09:20.178 --> 01:09:25.342
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:09:32.865 --> 01:09:36.255
May God bless you.

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:41.269
You can get more breeze when you ask such a question,

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:45.487
because that is the truth.

01:09:51.223 --> 01:09:54.465
You ask the question: "Was Christ the Son of God?"

01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:58.517
Just put hands for it.

01:10:05.407 --> 01:10:09.625
You start getting much more.

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:13.810
That is the truth.

01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:18.698
Now you can find about anyone.

01:10:20.746 --> 01:10:25.253
May God bless you all.

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:33.207
I am going away tomorrow, I will come back after one year.

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:43.980
I hope you all will come to the collective

01:10:44.181 --> 01:10:50.969
and learn everything about it and become masters.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:01.669
You can see you felt the cool breeze.

01:11:03.712 --> 01:11:09.220
And now you will find your life will be transforming.

01:11:12.728 --> 01:11:17.313
So please now enjoy yourself.

01:11:18.673 --> 01:11:23.649
But please come to the collective, that is very important.

01:11:26.439 --> 01:11:30.329
If a nail is cut, it doesn't grow,

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:34.954
it has to be the part and parcel of the whole.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:46.254
You have brothers and sisters all of the world.

01:11:48.465 --> 01:11:52.957
I know one day all of us will be together.

01:11:55.637 --> 01:12:00.059
In any case, next year I will definitely come.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:04.293
Next year I will definitely come.

01:12:07.876 --> 01:12:13.657
If you have any questions, you can write to Me.

01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:20.972
Very nice meeting you together.

01:12:23.496 --> 01:12:28.636
Now please don't do guru shopping,

01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:34.417
because that is the proper disease.

01:12:35.723 --> 01:12:41.003
When we find water in one place, we dig the well there.

01:12:42.207 --> 01:12:46.581
When we find water in one place, we dig the well there.

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:56.440
You don't go on digging all over.

01:12:58.534 --> 01:13:03.807
There is no marketing here.

01:13:06.089 --> 01:13:10.291
It is all open.

01:13:10.933 --> 01:13:14.995
And you all can have the complete knowledge about yourself

01:13:15.196 --> 01:13:18.979
and about others.

01:13:21.657 --> 01:13:26.508
This is how the whole world is going to change.

01:13:28.766 --> 01:13:34.313
And you are the people who are going to change the world.

01:13:36.868 --> 01:13:40.750
Thank you very much.

01:15:47.953 --> 01:15:50.148
Keep out all these horrible people.

01:15:50.349 --> 01:15:54.585
They are just out to make money. That’s all.

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:13.349
He too was there and how much he suffered.

01:16:18.704 --> 01:16:22.485
It’s all money making.

01:16:30.957 --> 01:16:36.006
They just mesmerize. That’s why you start giving money, everything.

01:16:36.207 --> 01:16:42.074
People have perhaps sold their houses for these horrible gurus.

01:16:53.421 --> 01:16:57.408
There is no modus operandi that you should know that:

01:16:57.609 --> 01:17:01.906
"How, why, what is it?" You must know everything, isn’t it?

01:17:02.107 --> 01:17:05.372
If it is scientific, you should know what are the centers are,

01:17:05.573 --> 01:17:09.364
how they work out, how to cure them, how to do it,

01:17:09.565 --> 01:17:14.932
everything you should know. You just go on paying money to them.

01:17:25.304 --> 01:17:30.252
Everything should be tangible and logical.

01:17:32.924 --> 01:17:39.575
You will know everything, everything, about your self and about others.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:48.257
All these things, you should not be trying.

01:17:59.689 --> 01:18:04.089
If someone doesn’t feel the breeze very well, what should he do?

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:06.290
It’s alright. You come and see them, you will feel it.

01:18:06.491 --> 01:18:11.547
There must be something wrong here (Vishuddhi).

01:18:15.618 --> 01:18:18.761
Doesn’t matter. Everybody will feel it.

01:18:18.962 --> 01:18:23.639
May be little here with cervical plexus, something wrong there.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:30.161
The cervical nerves may be little numb. That’s all. Everybody will feel it.

01:18:41.726 --> 01:18:51.284
Now the thing is that, if they say that you ascent,

01:18:51.485 --> 01:18:54.798
then you must have some powers.

01:18:54.999 --> 01:18:58.573
you must have some powers and you should know everything.

01:18:58.774 --> 01:19:03.364
You should have the full knowledge, how it works.

01:19:06.474 --> 01:19:11.412
Don’t believe into anything that is blind.

01:19:32.832 --> 01:19:36.715
She says that she came late tonight, but she felt the breeze.

01:19:36.916 --> 01:19:41.095
And she can feel her chakras, her lower chakra on the right side

01:19:41.296 --> 01:19:44.007
paining, aching. She wants to know what does it mean.

01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:46.208
It’s alright. It will be cured.

01:19:46.409 --> 01:19:51.263
You must be very futuristic, thinking too much.

01:20:29.194 --> 01:20:33.194
The first time he meet you was in Brasilia in 89

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:38.543
and now after meditation, he feels much much more. And he is so happy.

01:20:38.744 --> 01:20:41.950
Because you see, I have told you, it's a collective.

01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:45.122
If you are in the collective you grow very fast.

01:20:45.323 --> 01:20:48.148
So because you were left alone, that’s why.

01:20:48.349 --> 01:20:51.483
Now you be in the collective you will master it in no time.

01:20:51.684 --> 01:20:56.108
In 8 days these people mastered it.

01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:10.778
Overnight people have given up drugs, alcohol, everything nonsensical.

01:21:17.928 --> 01:21:24.275
Is there any problem to Sahaja Yoga to eating meat or drinking alcohol?

01:21:24.476 --> 01:21:29.500
You just give up whatever is not constructive, because of the light.

01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:32.133
You see the light, and in the light,

01:21:32.334 --> 01:21:34.718
you see what is the snake in your hand,

01:21:34.919 --> 01:21:39.100
you just throw it away yourself. I don’t say anything.

01:22:08.029 --> 01:22:11.310
You are blessed already (...)

01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:14.092
You will know how miracles are there.

01:22:14.293 --> 01:22:17.948
And what blessings you have got. Every moment is a blessing.

01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:24.328
You will be surprised because this, you know God is very efficient.

01:22:48.537 --> 01:22:53.994
While she put her head little back, she felt little round round.

01:22:54.195 --> 01:22:58.234
It’s alright. Might be you are having spondylitis. It’s curable.

01:23:18.898 --> 01:23:21.845
How can we learn to forgive?

01:23:22.046 --> 01:23:27.006
It’s nothing. Just say: "I forgive everyone". That’s all. Finished.

01:23:31.069 --> 01:23:35.256
Just say: "I forgive everyone".  Finished.

01:23:44.463 --> 01:23:48.386
It’s a very innocent question.
