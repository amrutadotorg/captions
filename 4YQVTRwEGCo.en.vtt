00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:58.125
Today in the land of Shri Krishna

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:04.208
we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:14.125
Is something very unprecedented

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:25.542
and of a very significant value

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:32.834
that you should be celebrating

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:43.834
the birthday of Shri Krishna’s Son in His own land.

00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:48.041
You know that Shri Ganesha incarnated

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:51.750
on this Earth as Mahavishnu

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:59.166
and He was the Son of Radha,

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:10.417
who incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:15.333
So by celebrating this birthday

00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:20.000
today you are recognizing the greatest truth

00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:29.250
that Lord Jesus Christ was the son of Shri Krishna.

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:38.333
There’s a story about it if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam,

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:47.959
how this Primordial Child took a form of an egg

00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:52.333
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesha

00:10:52.709 --> 00:11:00.000
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:13.166
In the evolutionary process all these happenings

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:18.667
of the antiquities

00:11:21.834 --> 00:11:24.333
have been recorded

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.291
but today

00:11:28.583 --> 00:11:31.000
I feel so gratified that

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:35.625
on the human level people have understood,

00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:48.333
Christ is the incarnation of Lord Ganesha.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:54.625
He is the Eternal Child

00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:59.417
but in the form when He came as Christ,

00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:06.834
He came as the son of Shri Krishna.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:13.917
But when Parvati made Shri Ganesha,

00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:19.999
He was the son of Parvati alone.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.917
There was no Father.

00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:31.125
Parvati Herself wanted to have a child of Her own.

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:37.000
There were angels who were dedicated

00:12:37.792 --> 00:12:41.208
either to Vishnu or to Shiva,

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:49.917
like ganas were dedicated

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:56.166
to Shiva alone.

00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:02.709
So, She wanted to have Her own Son

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:05.959
who can

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.875
permeate

00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:21.333
Her powers on this Earth.

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:37.083
So to begin with when the Shakti created this Universe

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:41.667
and Sadashiva was watching Her creation,

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:48.333
the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:54.999
and the embodiment of that innocence was Shri Ganesha.

00:13:57.458 --> 00:14:02.750
The whole Universe was covered with innocence,

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:08.959
which we call as Omkara.

00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:22.999
This innocence protected all the creation of the world

00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:27.291
and penetrated into all that is matter.

00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:31.458
Matter is innocent.

00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:37.625
If you hit the matter, it will hit you back

00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:40.000
because it is built like that.

00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:44.333
It doesn’t want to harm you by any method

00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:46.917
except that if you try to hit it,

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:53.667
it hits you back, in its own nature.

00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:58.250
So it was called as Jada,

00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:06.458
the one that acts according to the built-in nature.

00:15:09.792 --> 00:15:15.417
Innocence in the animals is of another kind,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.917
where the animals do not know

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.250
that they are committing crimes.

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:23.583
Animals

00:15:25.709 --> 00:15:30.000
when they say, kill an animal, another animal,

00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:36.458
or trespass your properties,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.041
create nuisance all over,

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:43.709
they don’t know they are committing a sin

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.834
or they are disobeying some laws.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:55.333
They live with the laws that are built within them,

00:15:55.792 --> 00:16:00.291
that’s why they are called as pashus means bondage

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:03.250
– the pasha. Pasha means the bondage.

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:10.959
They are under the bondage of the laws of God.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:21.625
Shri Shiva is called as Pashupati.

00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:29.500
Up to that stage the innocence remains intact

00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:39.125
because there is no development of ego in them.

00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:44.458
So they are innocent.

00:16:44.834 --> 00:16:49.917
A tiger may eat a cow, still he is innocent

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:52.750
or an elephant may trample

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:59.417
over a human body, still he is innocent.

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:10.083
But when going to a higher state,

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:15.999
the Mother Shakti, the Primordial Mother thought

00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:19.959
of creating a personality

00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:27.458
who will protect the innocence of human beings.

00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:31.250
Above the matter, above the animals,

00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:36.041
She created Shri Ganesha.

00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:38.834
And you know the story of Shri Ganesha

00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:42.375
how He got the head of an elephant

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:45.750
– symbolizing that Shri Ganesha,

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:48.000
though He is a human being,

00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:52.291
He is like an animal as far as His head is concerned,

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:58.208
that too of Shri Gajanana, in the sense that

00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:03.792
He has got the head of an elephant

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:11.375
which is the wisest animal in the animal kingdom.

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:17.709
So in such a head, which is innocent,

00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:19.875
ego cannot develop.

00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:25.166
There is no ego. It’s an ego-less state.

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:35.458
But human beings were created in a different manner

00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:44.583
and when carbon was placed to create aminoacids,

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:51.625
it also settled them in motion,

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:57.083
a new type of evolution in human beings

00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:01.875
that at the Vishuddhi level human beings raised

00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:05.041
[his head] their heads like this.

00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:08.291
Animals’ heads are on the ground

00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:17.333
so the energy flows downward into Mother Earth

00:19:17.834 --> 00:19:21.041
but when man raised his head above,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.041
against the energy of gravity,

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:33.917
then a new complication started in the energy flow

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
and that is how at the Vishuddhi,

00:19:39.417 --> 00:19:44.959
a problem started where Kundalini

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.959
could not

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.625
nourish

00:19:54.999 --> 00:20:00.999
or look after that problematic Vishuddhi.

00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:07.125
The reason is when you raise your head

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.917
from the Mother Earth,

00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:12.959
you remove yourself away

00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:17.542
from the natural power of Mother Earth.

00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:24.291
When you take your Vishuddhi upward like that,

00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:28.875
you see the result of that in this country

00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:34.250
which is the country of Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:40.875
that you started going to machines which are against nature,

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:44.041
extracting the nature,

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:49.709
disturbing the nature by creating atomic bombs,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.041
by changing the atom, breaking it.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:01.709
That means you went against the nature itself

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.500
by raising your head.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.792
But if it was done

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.583
in complete surrender to God,

00:21:17.458 --> 00:21:21.917
with your bent head towards the Mother Earth,

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:26.208
it would not have harmed you.

00:21:26.667 --> 00:21:34.875
But when you completely cut off yourself from that nature,

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:40.000
which is so bountiful, which is so gracious.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.041
Yesterday you saw the beautiful pictures

00:21:43.417 --> 00:21:48.166
of the nature that surrounds you in this country.

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:55.083
Such a rich country like America,

00:21:56.458 --> 00:22:01.291
without any gratitude towards its Creator

00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:04.458
raised its head upward

00:22:04.917 --> 00:22:10.166
– that’s how the Vishuddhi problem started coming up.

00:22:12.458 --> 00:22:18.625
In every walk of life, the whole social structure

00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:22.250
was built up to fight the nature,

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:26.417
not to go along with the nature.

00:22:27.625 --> 00:22:33.250
So the first attack came on the innocence itself

00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:38.208
– on the Mooladhara itself.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:44.417
So the natural ways of Mooladhara were given up.

00:22:45.834 --> 00:22:54.041
Marriage system has been here much before Christ,

00:22:55.333 --> 00:23:02.875
much before Abraham, much before Moses

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:15.333
and a sanctified marriage, which was blessed by the society,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.792
was acceptable since long.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.375
But man in his arrogance

00:23:27.792 --> 00:23:31.959
raised his voice against the marriage,

00:23:32.417 --> 00:23:40.000
against the natural way of leading a life of sanity.

00:23:41.583 --> 00:23:51.959
If it was natural to be the way people lead their private life,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.834
why do they get all kinds of diseases?

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:05.000
If you are a natural person, you don’t get any diseases.

00:24:08.208 --> 00:24:10.709
Because you are anti-nature,

00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:16.500
that’s why

00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:23.750
in this country now many man and women were murdered

00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:26.625
for jealousy?

00:24:27.917 --> 00:24:30.625
If it was natural

00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:33.875
to be in love with ten men and ten women

00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.667
then why jealousy?

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:44.959
You should be happy, it’s very natural.

00:24:47.959 --> 00:24:51.208
Because the head was raised at Vishuddhi Chakra

00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:57.166
without surrendering to Shri Krishna,

00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:11.750
anti-life, anti-biotic atmosphere started growing.

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:21.041
And this kind of life has taken this great country,

00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:27.625
now to the brink of complete destruction.

00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:33.709
The attack of innocence

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:39.709
is the greatest weakness of this country.

00:25:40.917 --> 00:25:49.959
Not to value the power of chastity and a chaste life

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:59.625
is the biggest mistake that was created by the people

00:26:00.041 --> 00:26:05.083
who started all kinds of trends and fads.

00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:12.417
Ganesha is the root of Creation.

00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:16.834
When you go against Shri Ganesh

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:22.083
you start losing your roots, you have no roots at all.

00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:27.125
Then you get drifted into anything stupid,

00:26:27.542 --> 00:26:32.417
anything new that comes up.

00:26:33.208 --> 00:26:40.709
So much so that a person like Freud was worshipped

00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:44.875
and they forgot Christ,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.041
who said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:54.417
Ganesha to that level, that even the eyes have to be innocent.

00:26:54.875 --> 00:26:59.917
There should be no lust in your eyes.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.667
But arrogance

00:27:08.458 --> 00:27:10.417
made them feel, “What’s wrong?

00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:14.542
What’s wrong in this? What’s wrong in this?”

00:27:14.959 --> 00:27:22.625
Now the whole country is facing a great crisis

00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:31.458
because of arrogant enterprises.

00:27:34.166 --> 00:27:44.667
Still they make a martyrdom out of all that is destructive.

00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:54.166
It’s a very great responsibility on the Sahaja yogis

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.750
who live on the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:10.500
But for the people who live in the land of Shri Krishna,

00:28:10.917 --> 00:28:18.959
the responsibility is absolutely on your neck

00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:26.000
and you can’t get out of it.

00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:31.208
Unless and until you understand the importance

00:28:31.583 --> 00:28:34.792
of innocence in your life

00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:40.750
you cannot save this country whatever I may try to do for it.

00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:45.500
It’s only you who are going to save it.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.458
It’s only you who are going to make it.

00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:58.333
When the Kundalini rises

00:28:58.999 --> 00:29:02.000
Shri Ganesha is awakened in you,

00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:07.999
the Ganesha whom you never respected,

00:29:08.834 --> 00:29:17.041
slowly comes up from His slumber,

00:29:17.709 --> 00:29:22.375
out of the hurt and the injuries inflicted on Him,

00:29:22.709 --> 00:29:26.375
still He stands up.

00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:27.875
But still we ...?

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:35.000
How are we going to nourish it?

00:29:35.458 --> 00:29:42.959
How are we going to look after its growth?

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:53.750
The responsibility of Sahaja yogis of America is very great.

00:29:54.417 --> 00:29:59.500
They cannot cheat any more themselves.

00:29:59.959 --> 00:30:05.375
They cannot be satisfied with their arrogance.

00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:10.999
The mistakes have been grievous.

00:30:11.959 --> 00:30:16.667
So you have to take it up as a crusade

00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:19.500
against those mistakes

00:30:20.375 --> 00:30:25.125
and to establish your Shri Ganesha in a full form

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.291
so that He gives you the necessary balance

00:30:29.291 --> 00:30:34.041
and the roots to nourish yourself.

00:30:34.875 --> 00:30:36.458
It is shocking first.

00:30:36.792 --> 00:30:40.000
I mean you just can’t understand;

00:30:40.875 --> 00:30:42.417
it is impossible

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:49.917
to see how you could accept such absurd ideas;

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:59.458
how you could take to such funny things,

00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:08.750
which are obviously horrid.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.792
Are we not aware of certain words like prostitution?

00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:22.166
And all other dirty words that they use,

00:31:22.542 --> 00:31:25.291
which I don’t want to say just now,

00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:30.458
or they have lost their meanings?

00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:38.125
We were all aware of it, we all knew about it.

00:31:38.834 --> 00:31:43.166
[Don’t do that … You should not.

00:31:43.625 --> 00:31:49.000
When I’m speaking must be quiet, all right?]

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:55.959
Have we lost all wisdom from our minds

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.959
that we cannot see

00:32:02.667 --> 00:32:05.417
what we have done to ourselves?

00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:11.041
We have no self-respect.

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:19.583
Arrogance to that limit is very dangerous,

00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:26.625
extremely unpredictable.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:30.750
And God knows what can come through

00:32:31.083 --> 00:32:38.041
with all these ventures we have gone into.

00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:43.834
I would say for Sahaja yogis,

00:32:44.166 --> 00:32:49.709
I have given some instructions with people

00:32:50.083 --> 00:32:56.792
– how they should respect their privacy of life,

00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:05.000
specially the women of America.

00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:08.792
If they have to be the shaktis,

00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:15.875
they have to respect their chastity.

00:33:17.542 --> 00:33:26.625
But so surprising that when we see outside

00:33:27.125 --> 00:33:32.667
all these things happening, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:40.542
some of us try to be one of them who are going to hell.

00:33:41.458 --> 00:33:43.917
If you have to save them,

00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:53.041
then try to fix your positions, properly.

00:33:54.625 --> 00:34:00.125
Shri Ganesha has four hands

00:34:01.542 --> 00:34:09.041
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:15.792
is the one you have to be careful about.

00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:23.375
That is His job

00:34:26.166 --> 00:34:28.542
and if you neglect Him,

00:34:30.959 --> 00:34:33.375
that force will act

00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:37.875
and act so vehemently

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.999
that despite your realization

00:34:41.375 --> 00:34:46.208
you may not be able to save yourself.

00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:49.875
Do not take your realization for granted.

00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:52.875
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:56.542
your realization has no meaning at all.

00:34:57.125 --> 00:34:59.166
Watch yourself,

00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:03.709
have you got adulterous eyes?

00:35:07.792 --> 00:35:13.041
Have you got an adulterous mind?

00:35:16.667 --> 00:35:23.542
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

00:35:24.792 --> 00:35:28.291
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:34.709
then you must get a good amount of health,

00:35:35.208 --> 00:35:36.999
money

00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:42.333
and position,

00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:44.417
power.

00:35:48.208 --> 00:35:55.542
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

00:35:55.917 --> 00:36:00.500
Nirmal Ganesha.

00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:09.500
“Oh, Mother, please give us

00:36:10.417 --> 00:36:16.000
the blessings of establishment of purity

00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:22.333
in our Ganesha principle.”

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.250
In relationships,

00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:32.542
in attitudes,

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.000
in behavior,

00:36:42.208 --> 00:36:46.792
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:58.625
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:04.417
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:11.041
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:15.834
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:22.792
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

00:37:23.291 --> 00:37:28.417
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:34.333
Everything that is done against Him after realization

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:39.250
will tell upon you

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:47.375
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.583
as absolutely degraded people.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.999
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

00:37:57.417 --> 00:38:04.041
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:08.333
Whatever you have done in the past is finished now

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.417
because you are a new bird.

00:38:11.834 --> 00:38:14.875
But after becoming this,

00:38:15.375 --> 00:38:21.750
if you try to take to these wrong ideas

00:38:22.709 --> 00:38:31.208
or to indulge into them, I cannot help you at all.

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:40.125
After all Shri Ganesha is My Son

00:38:41.709 --> 00:38:45.834
because He is pure.

00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:51.709
Now He is not the only son I have.

00:38:52.083 --> 00:38:55.208
I have so many sons and daughters

00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.041
and I have made you in the same way

00:38:58.041 --> 00:39:02.333
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

00:39:02.917 --> 00:39:06.000
on My own.

00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:13.667
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.834
and purity of your body is going to please.

00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:28.583
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:33.792
My name itself means purity.

00:39:35.125 --> 00:39:37.083
You can do it.

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.000
You are empowered to do it.

00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:40.875
You have a Kundalini to do it.

00:39:41.208 --> 00:39:47.083
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.875
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:56.208
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:02.000
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:10.375
All your incurable diseases right from

00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:17.333
all muscular troubles like mellitus and all that,

00:40:17.667 --> 00:40:22.667
all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards,

00:40:24.999 --> 00:40:27.709
all your psychosomatic problems

00:40:29.583 --> 00:40:32.583
right from schizophrenia, everything

00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:37.500
come because of the disturbance in Mooladhara.

00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:43.875
When the roots are not all right,

00:40:45.291 --> 00:40:48.166
how can you cure the tree?

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.542
If the roots are all right

00:40:50.999 --> 00:40:54.917
then any medicine can reach any center,

00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:59.792
any area, any place, any fruit.

00:41:01.583 --> 00:41:04.208
But if the roots are not all right,

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.709
how can you work it out?

00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:12.834
Today you have called Me here,

00:41:13.166 --> 00:41:18.041
to worship Shri Ganesha, within Me.

00:41:20.875 --> 00:41:27.000
Shri Ganesha within Me is a powerful identity.

00:41:28.792 --> 00:41:34.375
While worshipping Him you have to know

00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:41.250
that such a powerful thing

00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:45.750
you have to establish within yourself

00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:50.125
and by that establishment

00:41:52.667 --> 00:42:01.458
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

00:42:05.834 --> 00:42:08.875
and the power of Shri Ganesha’s

00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:15.291
greatness is auspiciousness.

00:42:20.208 --> 00:42:24.917
It’s a coefficience;

00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:31.083
it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language,

00:42:31.792 --> 00:42:37.750
that emits auspiciousness.

00:42:43.083 --> 00:42:49.625
It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth.

00:42:50.792 --> 00:42:54.709
The same magnet is within you,

00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.000
which is Shri Ganesha.

00:42:57.291 --> 00:42:59.750
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:07.375
which is the north, south, east, west.

00:43:08.041 --> 00:43:11.000
Close My eyes, still I’ll tell you.

00:43:11.417 --> 00:43:14.375
You know there are so many birds who fly out

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.667
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.125
because they have that magnet with them,

00:43:20.458 --> 00:43:22.458
they have that innocence with them.

00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:24.333
There are so many fishes,

00:43:24.709 --> 00:43:29.625
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

00:43:30.542 --> 00:43:32.834
Scientists should find out.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:41.125
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:50.667
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

00:43:51.875 --> 00:43:52.667
becomes magnetic

00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:08.291
and magnet attracts the steel

00:44:09.542 --> 00:44:14.875
– not dried leaves, does not – steel.

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:18.792
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

00:44:19.208 --> 00:44:22.834
Is a man with the steel, say.

00:44:23.291 --> 00:44:29.500
“Man of steel” – a person who has character, conviction

00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:34.625
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.542
is a man of steel.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:47.208
So this magnet attracts the steel.

00:44:47.917 --> 00:44:54.583
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

00:44:56.041 --> 00:45:02.208
not pliable, it’s rather dry

00:45:04.625 --> 00:45:08.375
but the magnet attracts, means

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:14.667
it creates that special quality in the steel

00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:19.417
that it moves towards the magnet.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.625
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:32.041
you’ll be amazed.

00:45:32.542 --> 00:45:34.750
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

00:45:35.125 --> 00:45:36.834
they’ll be running towards you.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:41.542
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:47.000
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

00:45:47.709 --> 00:45:52.959
– anywhere, any place.

00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:57.792
So what is this magnet?

00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:02.208
Is pure love.

00:46:02.917 --> 00:46:05.291
Is pure love

00:46:05.709 --> 00:46:10.417
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

00:46:10.875 --> 00:46:14.667
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:19.250
It is the support of itself.

00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:23.417
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

00:46:23.875 --> 00:46:25.125
doesn’t want anything,

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.333
doesn’t expect anything.

00:46:27.792 --> 00:46:33.417
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:39.709
That’s why they get attracted.

00:46:42.959 --> 00:46:45.375
Those who have not even seen Me,

00:46:45.875 --> 00:46:48.709
those who have not even known Me,

00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:51.750
just with My name, I’ve seen,

00:46:52.583 --> 00:46:56.291
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

00:46:56.875 --> 00:46:58.750
that they said, “We have to call the police”.

00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:00.792
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.667
we'll manage somehow.”

00:47:02.917 --> 00:47:04.458
In Poona we had such crowds

00:47:04.458 --> 00:47:08.000
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

00:47:08.083 --> 00:47:11.583
He said, “Mother, I’ll give You very big area

00:47:11.875 --> 00:47:14.125
where You can sit down in a big open place

00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:17.875
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished.”

00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:21.083
I said, “You don’t worry,

00:47:21.542 --> 00:47:24.125
everything will be in proper place.”

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:27.917
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

00:47:28.291 --> 00:47:32.875
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

00:47:33.291 --> 00:47:39.291
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

00:47:39.709 --> 00:47:42.542
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

00:47:42.875 --> 00:47:44.667
Just like a picture.

00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:48.959
No movement of hand, feet, eyes – nothing.

00:47:49.291 --> 00:47:53.375
Just sitting like a picture.

00:47:53.917 --> 00:47:57.166
And the gentleman who owned that hall

00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:01.667
had never seen such a thing before.

00:48:02.208 --> 00:48:04.917
Throughout for one and half hour,

00:48:05.834 --> 00:48:08.375
no movement of any kind.

00:48:11.458 --> 00:48:15.583
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

00:48:16.083 --> 00:48:20.917
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:23.667
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:28.750
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

00:48:29.083 --> 00:48:34.375
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

00:48:34.999 --> 00:48:45.375
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

00:48:46.625 --> 00:48:48.375
A child, there’s one child,

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.208
everybody is attracted towards the child.

00:48:53.709 --> 00:48:57.083
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

00:48:57.625 --> 00:49:02.625
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:05.291
everybody would be worried about the child.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:06.917
What’s happening to the child?

00:49:07.291 --> 00:49:12.208
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

00:49:12.709 --> 00:49:17.250
Unless and until it’s a devil.

00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:20.625
Why this attraction for children?

00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:22.583
Because their magnets are intact.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.125
Their ego has not yet developed.

00:49:25.542 --> 00:49:28.583
Our ego developed, had to develop

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.999
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:36.667
what is right and what is wrong.

00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:39.125
So the ego developed was all right.

00:49:39.542 --> 00:49:43.291
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

00:49:43.834 --> 00:49:47.875
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:50.166
overlapped the superego also.

00:49:50.583 --> 00:49:53.000
No conditioning, nothing.

00:49:53.542 --> 00:49:55.417
We’ll do whatever we like.

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:57.959
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

00:49:58.333 --> 00:50:01.250
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

00:50:01.625 --> 00:50:05.417
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

00:50:05.999 --> 00:50:07.917
No conditioning of any kind.

00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:13.625
All superego was also covered – ego.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:20.500
This ego would have been all right

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:25.458
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:31.458
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

00:50:31.959 --> 00:50:38.041
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

00:50:38.709 --> 00:50:44.125
If you see a farmer and a big professor

00:50:44.583 --> 00:50:48.417
or a very well educated man

00:50:48.875 --> 00:50:50.999
and talk to both of them. You’ll find the farmer

00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:58.999
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

00:51:00.166 --> 00:51:03.250
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

00:51:03.709 --> 00:51:05.333
He knows the living process.

00:51:05.792 --> 00:51:11.125
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

00:51:12.208 --> 00:51:17.458
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

00:51:17.917 --> 00:51:24.542
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:29.750
ten ego-oriented people.

00:51:31.999 --> 00:51:37.125
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:42.125
is that you become a wise person.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.041
When you speak, people start looking at you.

00:51:46.417 --> 00:51:51.208
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

00:51:51.750 --> 00:52:02.917
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

00:52:04.291 --> 00:52:07.959
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:12.125
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

00:52:12.625 --> 00:52:15.792
is good for nothing.

00:52:16.125 --> 00:52:19.125
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.166
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:25.792
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

00:52:26.125 --> 00:52:28.792
and hitting that person.

00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:31.625
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.750
they say, “That bull, the same bull”.

00:52:34.166 --> 00:52:35.875
Everybody reports about the same bull.

00:52:36.333 --> 00:52:40.917
“Oh, that’s the one, all right.”

00:52:43.959 --> 00:52:49.000
So it grants you wisdom.

00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:53.750
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

00:52:54.166 --> 00:52:56.375
your eyes are radiant.

00:52:56.834 --> 00:53:01.333
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

00:53:01.959 --> 00:53:04.667
when He is enlightening you;

00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:14.792
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

00:53:15.417 --> 00:53:18.625
But this glance is so powerful

00:53:18.999 --> 00:53:22.333
that even one glance is sufficient

00:53:22.792 --> 00:53:27.709
to purify thousands of people.

00:53:29.458 --> 00:53:33.999
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

00:53:34.667 --> 00:53:38.500
and you find whole thing changes

00:53:38.999 --> 00:53:42.166
into a beautiful morning

00:53:42.583 --> 00:53:48.667
from a complete dark night.

00:53:52.875 --> 00:53:56.834
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.875
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:05.875
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

00:54:06.458 --> 00:54:10.375
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:19.333
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:22.000
And when the Kundalini rises,

00:54:22.417 --> 00:54:28.208
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:30.667
But then when He sleeps down,

00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:36.208
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

00:54:41.333 --> 00:54:43.667
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:48.000
That’s not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

00:54:48.583 --> 00:54:56.083
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

00:54:56.542 --> 00:55:03.041
with something that cannot allow

00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:07.583
Shri Ganesha’s principle to manifest in us.

00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:12.458
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

00:55:12.999 --> 00:55:17.792
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

00:55:19.917 --> 00:55:24.291
That’s all, but it never dies.

00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:31.917
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

00:55:37.041 --> 00:55:41.375
The another quality of a person who is endowed

00:55:41.959 --> 00:55:45.625
with Shri Ganesha’s powers is that

00:55:46.041 --> 00:55:48.583
He removes all the hurdles.

00:55:48.959 --> 00:55:54.667
If one person of this nature is in some place,

00:55:55.166 --> 00:55:57.542
all the rest of the people who are nearby

00:55:57.959 --> 00:56:02.417
will be saved if there’s an accident or if there’s any problem,

00:56:02.999 --> 00:56:08.417
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:17.999
You will find this happening.

00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:25.375
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

00:56:26.041 --> 00:56:29.166
He guides you.

00:56:29.667 --> 00:56:32.500
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:35.792
He is the one who is Sahaja.

00:56:36.208 --> 00:56:40.625
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

00:56:41.125 --> 00:56:43.583
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.208
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

00:56:47.709 --> 00:56:50.750
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

00:56:51.125 --> 00:56:58.917
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.959
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:15.166
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

00:57:17.208 --> 00:57:19.000
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

00:57:19.458 --> 00:57:22.041
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.208
because all the Gods and Goddesses

00:57:24.667 --> 00:57:28.875
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:31.208
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

00:57:31.709 --> 00:57:32.959
He knows,

00:57:33.375 --> 00:57:43.083
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

00:57:43.959 --> 00:57:46.999
To have all the powers of the world,

00:57:47.375 --> 00:57:51.999
just keep the Mother pleased.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.166
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

00:57:58.542 --> 00:58:00.625
which can be described.

00:58:01.041 --> 00:58:08.041
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

00:58:10.667 --> 00:58:17.208
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

00:58:17.667 --> 00:58:19.999
but He is the one who will tell you

00:58:20.375 --> 00:58:23.875
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:28.500
That means He gives you the taste of love

00:58:29.041 --> 00:58:32.041
in the food that is cooked for you.

00:58:32.583 --> 00:58:36.291
Because He is love.

00:58:37.458 --> 00:58:43.458
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.

00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:47.583
Once they asked Me to sing a song.

00:58:47.999 --> 00:58:49.999
I used to sing very well once upon a time

00:58:50.458 --> 00:58:52.250
but then after lecturing so many times,

00:58:52.792 --> 00:58:54.709
you see I think I lost My voice.

00:58:55.125 --> 00:58:57.333
I couldn’t sing well, I thought so.

00:58:57.834 --> 00:59:00.625
One day they asked Me to sing a song

00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:06.333
and I thought of some song and sang to them.

00:59:07.083 --> 00:59:12.208
And after a year or so in a program they said,

00:59:12.625 --> 00:59:14.750
“Mother we want to sing You a song.”

00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:18.291
This was a song unknown to everyone,

00:59:18.917 --> 00:59:20.959
I don’t know from where they got it,

00:59:21.458 --> 00:59:23.125
from where they made the tune.

00:59:23.542 --> 00:59:27.000
They started singing the same song.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:32.250
And such joy, I mean, it all became waves of tears

00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:36.333
in My eyes. I couldn’t control My joy.

00:59:36.834 --> 00:59:41.709
Now all this feeling of joy

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:47.917
comes from the devices produced by Shri Ganesha.

00:59:48.333 --> 00:59:54.625
He is busy creating relationships, beautiful.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.667
How? In a birthday, a child’s birthday, what do we say?

01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:02.750
“All right, so tomorrow morning

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:07.291
there’s a bird is going to drop a present for you.”

01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:11.041
And then the child gets up and sees there’s no bird.

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:13.583
It’s only Ganesha who has given the idea.

01:00:14.083 --> 01:00:18.792
We can say He is a Santa Claus.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.999
He gives you ways and methods and He tells you

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.875
how to delicately build up relationships, pure relationships.

01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:40.834
How you hide, how you wrap a little present,

01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:47.667
just put it there and a person who has to take it, sees it,

01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:52.291
“Oh God.” And then you see that flowers

01:00:52.792 --> 01:00:56.083
which you suddenly bring out, you put them,

01:00:56.542 --> 01:01:02.375
is all Shri Ganesha’s efforts, His ways, His suggestions.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:09.458
Among the creation, flowers are expressing

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:13.291
Shri Ganesha’s essence.

01:01:13.709 --> 01:01:15.166
And the essence of Shri Ganesha

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:22.750
comes from the Mother Earth’s essence, is the fragrance.

01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:29.333
So a person who is endowed

01:01:29.999 --> 01:01:33.999
with Shri Ganesha’s blessings has fragrance,

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:40.000
sometimes chandan, sometime roses,

01:01:40.625 --> 01:01:46.500
sometimes this gardenia.

01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:50.834
You just don’t know from where the fragrance is coming.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:56.834
The fragrance is coming from Shri Ganesh

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.750
and that is what is the magnet within you.

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:11.458
Such a person is fragrant, absolutely fragrant all the time.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:21.083
Shri Ganesha emits all kinds of fragrance from such a person.

01:02:26.291 --> 01:02:33.166
And that you can only feel when your Shri Ganesha is all right.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:41.959
There’s no end to the description of this great Deity within you.

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:45.750
He’s just settled down there, He’s all the time there,

01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:50.792
waiting to be cleansed out, for Him to raise His head,

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:54.500
like a lotus in the mud.

01:02:54.999 --> 01:02:57.667
You just help it out by respecting it

01:02:58.125 --> 01:03:01.333
and He’ll be there, fragrant within you.

01:03:01.834 --> 01:03:05.375
So important for this country

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:14.417
where we have raised our head without surrendering

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:23.625
it to the Virata, to the collectivity, to Shri Krishna.

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:27.333
We have raised our head,

01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:32.166
with Shri Ganesha we bow down our head,

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:37.709
for all the bounties that God has bestowed upon us.

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:39.792
All arrogance will disappear at the

01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:42.583
Lotus Feet of Shri Ganesha.

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:45.000
He’ll give us wisdom.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.667
He’ll give us sense to understand.

01:03:47.999 --> 01:03:50.625
He’ll give us power to overcome our arrogance

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.417
that is within us.

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:57.625
He’s the one who is the giver of knowledge.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:00.250
He’s the one who is give us light.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.125
Many people in India also worship Shri Ganesha,

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:06.709
go on “Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha,

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:13.041
and do all kinds of funny things.

01:04:13.667 --> 01:04:18.125
That’s like cheating yourself unnecessarily.

01:04:18.709 --> 01:04:22.792
It’s so simple to establish Shri Ganesha within you.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:30.125
But understand that it is vital

01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:34.667
that you people who are Sahaja yogis

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:38.583
should establish Shri Ganesha,

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:42.208
which is a silent power within you, doesn’t talk.

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:47.041
It’s a silent power, which acts.

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:52.041
Just a power that’s dynamic

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:59.125
without any noise, without any show.

01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:04.999
And that is what I would say that today

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:11.458
when I have said all these things from My heart,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.417
you the Sahaja yogis will establish Shri Ganesha within you.
