00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.680
The purpose of to-night's gathering is for you to have the opportunity, if you wish to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.440
to have this energy released

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.600
to have it pass through these various centers, to enlighten them, to switch them on, if you like,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.160
until eventually it will reach the top of your head which in effect is the [UNCLEAR] I talked to you about

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.320
and from that point you can become here what we call realized

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.920
people. You have a whole new world opened up to you.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.640
It is a very simple process, it requires nothing of you but your own will to [UNCLEAR]

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.700
Like most evolutionary events it's quite simple.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.640
Has to be simple, it has to be something that happens without effort on your part.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.640
Just as you became a human-being without effort so this is another step

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.220
in your evolutionary course.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.120
So, when Shri Mataji has finished Her talk She will offer you this experience.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.600
And I hope you'll get it.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:12.240

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.240
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.140

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.160
[UNCLEAR - YOU?] would like Me  to stand up and..

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.320
[UNCLEAR] I'll stand up [UNCLEAR] can't see you so. I will stand up

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.900
It's all right, it's all right, doesn't matter

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.360
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.500
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.320
We cannot mold it, we cannot organize it and we cannot order it.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.240
It exists, has existed and will exist.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.440
The truth is very simple and whatever I'm telling you

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.140
you have to seek it in a very scientific way.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.840
Like a scientist has to keep his mind open for any new ideas that come to him

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.260
and he should treat this as a hypothesis and if it is proved true then you have to accept it in all honesty.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.060
Now the truth is that there is a All-Pervading power

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.980
which is described in all the scriptures - All-Pervading power of love.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.900
These people could not have told us lies, they were not liars and they were not interested

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.160
in doing something which was not for our benevolence.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.100
But it has not been proved that such a power - the subtle power - exists.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.800
This power is the power

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:09.060
that thinks, that understands, does all the living work -

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.600
not only that but it organizes,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.460
it puts everything into order, it creates all the nature's circuits

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.420
and last of all it loves. This power exists

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.860
but we have never felt it before because at human level we cannot feel it.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.200
So, the second truth is that we're not only our body,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.660
our emotions, our ego, our thoughts,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.620
our plans but we are the spirit.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.260
And when we become the spirit - means when our attention gets enlightened

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.660
that the light of the spirit that resides in your heart,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.280
then you can feel on your finger-tips this beautiful power which is there,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.840
is described by all the sages, Incarnations and prophets.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.560
So, this power is to be felt.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.580
And if I say so, it is important that at least take it when we are

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.280
on the very [UNCLEAR] clouds, that you say in modern science [UNCLEAR]

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.980
Also you may be, beautiful way we should say, that it's the best time for this

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:50.160
because people are getting  out of [UNCLEAR - COMPARISON?], out of

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:58.280
their ideas about progress. They're thinking, "What is it that we're not so peaceful, why is it we

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:06.480
cannot enjoy our life as we should have enjoyed?" So, there's a very big uh.. urge to know the truth.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.820
And this is thing, is the pure desire within us that we have to know the truth.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.380
Now he's talked to you about Russia, I was really surprised,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.800
and the Russian people, I used to think, such suppressed people and all that.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.980
In a way they were suppressed very much, I should say, because uh..

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.280
of, they couldn't talk about politics, they couldn't discuss politics, they couldn't

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:40.680
uh.. go for elections and things like that. But there's something good about them - they have no conditionings, quite all right,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:48.420
they have no conditionings of any kind. Now, as far as religions are concerned

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.940
the people who started the religions were perfectly all right.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.340
They were truthful and they were like flowers on the tree of life.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.760
One after another they appeared and what all they preached, in the essence

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.120
they all said the same thing - that you are to be born again, you have to have your Self-realization.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:22.640
But when, human-beings took over from that, they started deviating from the right path.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:30.580
And that's why we find in every religion something that is very mysterious for our mind - we don't understand why

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.100
this is so. So the essence of all religions can be only understood

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.200
if you become your own essence and your essence is your spirit - that's the essence of life.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:50.620
And that's what you have to become and that is the last breakthrough for ordinary human-beings.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:57.480
The last breakthrough where you just jump into a new awareness -

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:05.580
which is described by Hume, very clearly, that now at the second step or the last step that we have

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.820
we have to become collectively conscious.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:15.180
We have become, is the point - it's not that we are collectively conscious, we have to become. A human

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.980
being has to become, that means on his Central Nervous System

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:27.880
he has to become collectively conscious and he has to feel that another person on his finger-tips.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:37.160
And when that happens, who is the other because you have feeled everyone within yourself.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.020
And if you know how to correct the problems that are within you

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:49.340
and without, you solve the problem. And this'll effect the whole emancipation

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:57.020
of humanity contained within us because within us lies our glory which we all do not know.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:04.180
We're lost in the ignorance part of ourselves. Like I would say, if there's a television

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:11.240
you take it to an Indian village and show them and tell them you can get scenes from Australia and all these

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:18.500
places they'll say, " Oh, how can that be, it's just a ordinary box." But when you put to the mains, it works

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.280
and it shows how fantastic it is.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.140
In the same way we are fantastic, we're made for a purpose to enjoy life,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.600
to enjoy everything in the purest form.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:41.040
And that purpose has to be served, very easily it is to be managed -

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:48.340
as we call it sahaja, means born with you. Sahaja - 'saha' is with - born with you.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.860
This is born with you, the grant to be

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.960
in yoga, means 'union with the Divine'.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:03.000
And this is your birthright - you all have to have it. Everyone has to have it.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.720
Some will have it before, some will have later on but gradually so many people will have to get it

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.760
like first one, one fish came on the water,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:21.820
and then few more and then few more and then the shoals of same. In the same way it is going to work out.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:28.740
It's working out uh... we are now working it out in forty nations.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:36.620
It works slowly because it's a living process. It's not something plastic that you can create,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.880
you cannot be member - you have to  become and for that you can't pay.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:48.360
You can't pay. I mean, like in the Mother Earth if you have to, say, sow something

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.700
and you want to sprout some seeds - the Mother Earth doesn't understand money.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.480
No use standing on your heads either. It just sprouts by itself. In the same way it acts.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.460
You cannot pay for it - this is one principle one must know, that you can't pay for your Self-realization.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.020
And that is something, is so much not known to people

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:16.000
and I'm sorry to say that many people have come out even from India and from all over

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:23.100
and are trying to befool people, take advantage of their simplicity and ignorance and make lot of money.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.420
I've been telling since long, that you should shun such people

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:35.900
and don't waste money on these nonsensical things. You cannot pay for God, you cannot pay for your Self-realization

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:43.540
because Self doesn't understand money - it's a man-made commodity. Self doesn't.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.000
And as a result of that, the Kundalini rises, so many things happen.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:55.160
Today I'll tell in you in short, tomorrow I'll explain to you how it works out on more scientific basis.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.560
But how it works out, is very interesting

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:06.340
that these centers that we have within us, as he must have shown you, seven centers, one is below the Kundalini

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.920
and six of them are above the Kundalini.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:19.200
Now, this Kundalini space is a bone called Sacrum, which means sacred - that means the Greeks knew about it

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.940
that it's a sacred bone containing some sort of a power.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:30.060
When this Kundalini rises, when this power, this residual power within us rises,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.440
it integrates all these subtle centers. Now these subtle centers

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.140
on the physical side also look after our plexuses, on the mental side also they look after them.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:48.420
So as it rises, nourishes them, integrates them and then connects it, connects it up to the mains.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:54.680
So all the time this energy starts flowing up. Now this energy has at least three powers.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:02.800
First power by which it comforts you. Comforting means your sickness - many incurable diseases can be cured by this.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.860
There are three doctors in Delhi now, have got their M.D. in sahaja yoga for curing uh..

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:15.340
uh..diseases like Asthma, like psychosomatic diseases and things like that.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:22.840
And now, it's gone up to America and also Helsinki - of course in Russia they have accepted as,

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:30.920
as an independent organization. This [UNCLEAR] organization they call it [UNCLEAR] although we have no organization as such.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.260
We cannot be organized as I told you. So,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:43.180
this power of healing, the comfort, comes through the nourishment of these subtle centers within us.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:50.600
And that's how, so many of people, so many people who have suffered from incurable diseases, have been cured

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.300
with the awakening of the Kundalini. I don't have to do anything, it's your own, it's within yourself.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:02.040
Only thing, an enlightened candle can enlighten another candle - in the same way it works.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:07.200
Now then, you have another beautiful uh..

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:14.340
present from this awakening is that, all your mental problems are solved. So many people who were mentally harassed,

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.980
who were schizophrenic and all kinds of problems of the mental depressions and all that, they got cured.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:29.160
But we do not say that everybody will be cured, most of them do get cured and gradually they settle down.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.100
You'll be surprised, there're many cases of Blood Cancer which have been cured.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:39.860
But that's not the main job of sahaja yoga - is not to cure people otherwise I better go to the hospitals and work it out.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:47.880
But the main job is to awaken the Kundalini, so that you become the spirit and once you become the spirit these things work out gradually.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:54.900
And then you become empowered yourself, that you can raise the Kundalini of others and can deal with them.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.540
Then, within us lies our own peace.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:05.860
You must have heard of so many peace foundations and people getting Nobel prizes for peace -

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.000
they have no peace within themselves. They make peace foundations where they talk about peace.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.320
Talking about peace doesn't bring forth any peace at all.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.980
You have to be peaceful within and the transformation of a human being is needed for achieving that state of complete peace.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:31.480
And then you become a witness - witness of everything like a drama you see everything - you're not bothered.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.040
Just look what is happening outside - you're not disturbed by that.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:43.360
On the contrary you're much better placed to solve the problems because you're out of it and you can see them so clearly and you can solve them.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:49.100
So, it makes you extremely dynamic and then you become enlarged -

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.860
pure love [UNCLEAR] compassion, extremely compassionate.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.940
But last of all you become joy.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.740
When we become joy it cannot be described because it is only joy, it's absolute.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:12.520
It is not happiness and unhappiness, it is joy and that joy is to be enjoyed.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:20.660
Apart from this uh..you become a very knowledgeable person because this brain of ours

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:27.800
is very partly used by us. But when the light of the spirit goes into it, you become extremely knowledgeable

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:34.500
and you become very, in a way, very intelligent, I would say - you see the point very clearly,

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:41.380
you become very wise and sensible. All these traits are very fantastic to ask because you can't believe it -

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:48.160
how can this happen? But it does happen, I must say, it does happen and because it's your own, it's within you.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:53.880
I mean, I'm doing nothing about it, I should say - it just works out because you have not known what you are!

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.000
Just you have to discover yourself, that's what is sahaja yoga.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.760
But we see wonders happening, in London specially, where we have lots of people who are

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:10.760
drug addicts, alcoholics, all absolutely uh...drenched into it.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.600
And overnight they gave up, overnight they gave up

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.380
that habit of alcoholism and drug and the whole thing is so surprising

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.240
how they suddenly became such beautiful people!

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:32.860
So sensible, so powerful that no habit can dominate them. All these things are there

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.640
just for you and you have to enjoy that, it's all your own.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.460
Now, because today is the first day, I would like to have some questions from you but relevant to the subject, would be better

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:50.060
because I'm here for nothing. I don't want any votes or any money from you - nothing of the kind.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:56.720
I'm just come here to tell you what you have and to enjoy it, so it's better to ask questions which are relevant.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Of course discussions and all that are not going to lead you there, talking too much is not going to lead you there because it is beyond

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:10.640
mental capacity of human beings. You have to go beyond, you have to become that Absolute Truth -

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.020
that All-Pervading Truth.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:23.520
And for that you cannot discuss it or argue it out but if you have any problems, please ask Me - I'll be very, very

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.540
true to tell you about it. Thank you very much.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.860
[UNCLEAR] can we just asking questions now or  [UNCLEAR]

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.760
- What's she saying, I can't hear?
- Yes, please do.
- All right.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.880
[UNCLEAR] I want to ask you, sometimes I get pain in the [UNCLEAR] Kundalini wants to come up

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:07.060
I get pardoned because I've heard [UNCLEAR] come up too fast

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.300
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE - CAN YOU FIND OUT?] if that's true or

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.640
- She said sometimes she feels that her Kundalini is going to rise but she gets frightened because she's been told [UNCLEAR]
-

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.760
- Ah, it's correct, naturally - I know, I know, I'll talk about that
- Yeah.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:29.280
Uh.. is a fact, you see, that people have really frightened people against, against Kundalini.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:37.220
I know it's a very negative attitude of people to stop people from getting their Self-realization.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.520
You see, She's your mother

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:49.200
and when you were born your mother took over all the trouble, all the trouble. In the same way, She is

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:56.660
your individual mother and She knows - like a tape recorder She's taped everything within Herself what you have been and what

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:04.260
has been happening to you and She's so beautiful, She rises up so sweetly, without any problem -

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.720
I mean, I've seen thousands of people, thousands of them all over the world.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.760
Nobody got into any trouble, on the contrary everybody became very beautiful.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.860
O course you do feel little heat if it, there's a little bit of problem or some sort of problem or a cancer

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.140
patient sometimes feel the heat on the hands - that's all, not much.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:31.880
But why, why the [UNCLEAR] to Hatha yoga and [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:39.420
why do they take so long uh.. in their training and why do they make sure that the Kundalini comes up

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.060
slowly and not too fast - why is that necessary for them?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.100
- With sahaja yogies, you mean sahaja yogies?
- [INAUDIBLE] Hatha yoga and

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:57.500
Haan, haan, haan, you see, [UNCLEAR] I was secured. You see, Hatha yoga was established

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:04.140
- thousands of years back by Patanjali.
- Patanjali? Oh!
- By Patanjali, all right?

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.600
And Patanjali has talked about Ashtagarkar - eight parts of [UNCLEAR].

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:16.380
In those days the life was very different and in India that time we had uh..

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:24.400
uh.. ashramas - means people lived in four styles. The first style was called Brahmacharya - celibate life -

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.480
they lived in the ashramas and where they used to select very few people who could get their Self-realization.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.940
The rest of them were taught how to improve your health, this , that and slowly, slowly

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:45.800
I mean, we should say that, on the tree of life there were hardly one or two flowers

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.600
so they couldn't make up fruits but today it's a blossom time.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:58.140
- Oh, so You're saying [UNCLEAR] the Kundalini come up I'm not going to go inside
- Oh, of course [LAUGHTER]

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:05.360
He said it. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. You don't have to worry all about. You see, this is a gentle

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.200
[UNCLEAR - PAGE?] all right and Kundalini has perhaps become the gentle as well,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:17.860
[UNCLEAR] the tree of civilization has grown so big, all right, and the roots

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.620
are also developing. If you don't feel your roots, the civilization will disappear.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:30.120
So, there's an equal and opposite growth and that's why it works out very fast.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.320
Of course I must say, that I did some work on that also

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:42.820
to find out the permutations and combinations why human beings take so much time to get realization - now they don't.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:50.020
But you have to establish yourself. First the Kundalini will rise, build our breakthrough, you might feel the cool breeze,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:56.600
immediately you'll feel on your hands, finger-tips will feel it, coming out of your head but

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:03.800
after some time you have to allow it to grow.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:10.080
Like a seed which is sprouted has to grow into a plant and then into a tree - it's like that.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.100
Takes hardly a month, at the most - you can become a master of it.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.020
Sounds quite fantastic, isn't it?

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:27.420
- Mother, is it safe to give realization to children?
- Oh absolutely, they are the best.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:35.340
Don't have to do much about them, they just get it automatically - they are the sweetest things, don't you think so?

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:43.120
And these days the so many children are born, are realized souls, I'm surprised! So many children are realized souls, we don't understand them.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.980
And also the people who get married in sahaja yoga, if they're both are sahaja yogies,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.640
then they get all realized souls born to them. I think there are many

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.300
realized souls waiting to be born - they want to see good parents, that's all.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:11.540
It has been said that you have to be spiritually ready before you can awaken the Kundalini

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:19.480
- otherwise you won't be able to control it.
- You see, I would say that your Kundalini knows everything about you,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:26.860
and She knows everything and She judges you - you don't have to worry about that point. She is the surgeon

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.840
and She knows what is to be done. So you don't have to worry and you don't have to certify yourself.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:38.280
Only thing is, that you must know that you must have committed some mistakes, so it's all right, you're a human being, you're not God.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:46.780
If you have made mistakes, doesn't matter, don't feel guilty. I mean this is another thing in the Western mind that we should feel guilty for everything. You see,

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:53.860
even if I put the thing like this, I should say sorry and sorry and sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about [LAUGHTER]

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:59.780
You see, so there are so many norms we have made uh to make us [UNCLEAR] -

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:05.860
there's nothing to feel guilty at all, nothing to feel guilty. On the contrary you have to be very confident about yourself.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:14.760
You are a human being an epitome - epitomy of the evolution - the top-most people.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:23.900
All these side issues people have started because they don't know how to raise the Kundalini, I think.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:30.360
Like supposing, if I had to plug this, If I don't know any plug [UNCLEAR], you see, I know where to do it.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:36.780
But supposing he doesn't know anything, he'll go around the whole world and touch something and say that Kundalini awakening is horrid.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.680
They have to know it, that's all.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.960
- I would say, I would say that we are totally Divine, each person
- Of course.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:56.400
But we, but the scientists and religion, as such, has always told us about sinners.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:02.540
- That's all wrong
- That's [UNCLEAR]
- Is all wrong. You see, this is how they start telling everybody, "You are sinners."

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:10.060
So that you give lot of money to them so that they can wipe out your sins, sins. To be very frank, it's all wrong.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:18.180
And even in Christianity I've seen that so many things have gone wrong, of course Hinduism has the same problem, everybody

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.620
thinks they're sinners and they're committing sins here and there.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:28.700
But recently there's a nice discovery about a book uh.. they have written

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:35.040
when Thomas, the disciple of Christ was coming to Italy, he passed through Egypt and he wrote

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.260
beautiful treatise about Christ and he said that, "You don't have to feel

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:47.920
uh..unhappy, don't have to suffer - Christ has suffered for you, now you don't suffer. You're not going to suffer more than He has suffered."

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:56.240
And he's talked, told about experiences spontaneity and everything he's talked about. But as soon as that was published, I think

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.440
the Christians got fright.., got worried about it. That's a fact.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.620
That's a fact because this idea of suffering has come from where, I don't know

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.920
maybe Mr. Paul or somebody has introduced it, I just don't know [LAUGHTER]

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:18.820
and he, this gentleman also calls it Pauling Christianity because he suffered from Epilepsy so might have.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.900
And sometimes it's just surprising, like if you go to the Sistine Chapel in Rome, you see the,

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:32.140
whole thing is nothing but Kundalini and this Last Judgment where the Kundalini rises and Christ residing there at the Agnya chakra.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:40.260
He's such a hefty, tall gentleman - that's what He should be but down below on the table there's one skeleton kept

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:46.840
like this, of Christ, you see - I say, with that skeleton could He have carried that horrible cross?

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:53.140
So this is how they want to depict that this is wrong and same thing in every religion. I mean, it's nothing new.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:01.200
Everybody must suffer. Why should you suffer for God? He is God Almighty, He is nothing but love.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:08.840
No father wants you to suffer - then He's the Father of all the fathers. All the love you have of a father comes from that source,

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:17.020
how can He ask you to suffer? I mean, reasonably you just see the point. No, there's no need at all.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:27.380
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE] Divine life.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.340
- What's she saying?
-  [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.200
- Hmm. What's she saying?
- Saying, in the Gospel of Thomas

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:45.180
- Annh?
- There is something in the Gospel of Thomas about light, saying Divine light [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:52.920
Yeah, correct. Yes, Thomas has said that, no doubt, and that's a very fact that you're the light

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:59.300
and light inside but if you see the light then you're not the light. If I see this light, that means I'm not that light.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:05.040
So, you don't have to see the light. Like Paul saw some light so he was not the light himself.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:15.660
And another idea too [UNCLEAR] and she said

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:23.260
- [UNCLEAR]
- What's she saying?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:31.560
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Who? Haan.
-  [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:38.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:46.400
Is correct, you see, what he said is true but we have to get out of the opposites. We have two opposites about which I'll tell you tomorrow.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:52.340
Now, I went and addressed the uh..Humians in New York and

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:59.960
I had not read him before much but I opened the book and saw the one mistake in his understanding about human beings was

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.920
that he had put uh.. his mind uh.. like

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:12.720
the Subconscious, and the Collective Subconscious and then the Subconscious, then the uh..Conscious mind and then the

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:20.320
Supra-conscious mind like that - into layers and layers like this, horizontal - that was  a mistake.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:28.780
It lies parallel and the central path is left open to us. After all He's a Creator

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:36.740
and a great organizer. Supposing you have to go to the aeroplane and you're rushing about, you have to pass through

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:42.900
all the luggage, jumping over everything - how will you reach there? He's a great organizer

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:51.060
so it is not horizontal, it is parallel. That's the only mistake he committed perhaps because he got his realization quite late in life

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:56.600
and there was no one to tell him about it but that you don't have to go to Subconscious - no.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:03.820
I'll tell you tomorrow where lies the Subconscious and where lies the Collective Subconscious and the Supra-conscious and the Collective Supra-conscious.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:11.240
All right? We have many Humians with us, I must say, in sahaja yoga.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:19.560
Can I ask you, can I ask you this truth that you need to have a master to touch your [UNCLEAR]

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:26.220
- [UNCLEAR]
- What?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:32.540
[UNCLEAR] dangerous to do without a master.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:40.980
- Oh, Tantrik yoga is the worst of all - in any way whether you have a master or no master.
- For what reason?

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.360
For one reason that they don't know anything about the mechanism.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.860
They are money makers, that's all. It's all money oriented.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.880
- [UNCLEAR]
- Tantrik is a money maker?
- Annh?
- Tantrik, tantrik is a money maker?

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:06.860
- Yeah, of course, they are. They
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR] What's she saying?

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:12.880
- [UNCLEAR] ancient countries money makers.
- I'm not talking about

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.140
- She's not talking about
- You see, tantra means, I'll tell you, explain to you, very clearly. Tantra means the mechanism.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.500
And the mechanism who knows are not the tantrikas but the people who are yogies.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:34.480
And the tantrikas are just the opposite of it, just opposite. Say, they do something wrong

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:42.480
to spoil your passage, what we call the Sushumna

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.820
and you are under their control because they use all kinds of witchcraft, this , that.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.780
These are the tantrikas. They were not tantrikas, they were yogies.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:57.680
No, no, there are two sides of tantriks. You're talking about the dark side, there's a, there's a light side as well.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.540
So far, I've not known any, I must say, but the only the yogies

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:09.440
they may, they only people who knew the tantra were the yogies or the great masters

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:16.020
but none of them, those who call themselves tantrikas came in India this process in the sixth century -

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:23.380
they were horrid people, [UNCLEAR - JUST?] horrid. They started in sixth century right from Konark

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:30.120
up to uh.., we can say, Panna and all that - you must have seen all these places yourself, if you go to India -

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:38.120
horrible thing and they use sex as the way to get realization. How can it be? You see now, the last center is here,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:44.460
the red one, all right, is below the Kundalini and this is the one which looks after your pelvic plexus,

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:50.240
which is looking after your all excretion, sex inclusive -

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.220
sex has nothing to do - at that time you become like a child when the Kundalini is rising.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:02.800
Your innocence comes back. Innocence is never lost in human beings, never lost - it is covered

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:10.240
like a cloud but never lost. So, all these tantrikas were using the sex energy or some sort of a nonsensical thing like that.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:17.760
So they started with the sixth century in India and because of the some of the licentious kings we had, it started growing now.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.400
- They were all nonsensical
- Oh.. I'm sorry but it's not without [UNCLEAR - Praise?]
- But you see, have you, you must see the result.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:31.960
Proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, all right? You should see the result of these tantrikas what they have created. They have created nothing.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:38.500
- because You're from India so You probably not have known [UNCLEAR]
- Oh, they just talk. I haven't seen anybody doing anything good anywhere.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:45.200
These tantrikas these days are settled in Delhi looking after our politicians teaching them other nonsensical things.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:50.760
- [INAUDIBLE]
- They're not, and you see yogi is not interested in all money making business.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:59.040
-Yes, madam?
- If someone has [UNCLEAR] of asthma, do you concentrate on one certain chakra or

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:07.180
- [UNCLEAR] area or do you have [UNCLEAR]
-  What she's saying?

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:15.040
- I'm sorry, you know, I can't understand the Australian English, sometimes [LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:20.500
- I'll try, after sometimes I'll get used to, I'll get used to, I'm sorry.
- If you suffer from Asthma [UNCLEAR]

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.740
do you concentrate on one particular chakra or you have to work on all of them.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:32.340
No, only on two chakras you have to work it out. And only, only two chakras, it works out.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:40.060
On this one, is the Right Vishudhdhi we call it and also the Right, uh..Right heart - only two chakras it works out.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:47.000
Sometimes of course you might have a left Vishudhdhi - but this, it's not difficult to work it out,  Asthma, it's not difficult.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:54.060
- So, what do you concentrate, on the heart one
- No, no, no, no not on the heart, there's a right heart we call it, right heart

00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:01.860
- All right
- Right heart, right heart and this Vishudhdhi on the right side - it's mostly right sided thing. It comes from liver,

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.920
take it from Me. Haan.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:16.040
Excuse me, Yoga is called union with this universal spirit of God or whatever You call it

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:23.940
- where is [UNCLEAR] have this union, where is He?
- Yoga is union with the power

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:32.140
- the All-Pervading power of, where is it?
- It's everywhere. It's in a subtle form everywhere, madam, everywhere.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.700
- Including me and You?
- Beg your pardon.
- Including all us?

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:44.620
Of course, it is all over. It's the Holy Ghost, as they call it. Is the power of the Holy Ghost

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.420
and the reflection of the Holy Ghost is the Kundalini. And what is the Holy Ghost?

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:53.720
It's a mystery but I'll tell you what is the Holy Ghost is.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:38:00.960
See, God Almighty has a son is out of [UNCLEAR] behind you.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:07.500
So the Primordial Mother is the Holy Ghost - we call it Adishakti in Indian language.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.680
And the reflection of this Adishakti is the Kundalini.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.420
You will understand everything. See in one lecture you cannot understand everything,

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:24.540
- No
- you see.
- I understand all this powerful and He can be experienced everywhere

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:30.700
but if He's in You and me [UNCLEAR] can't understand [UNCLEAR] You and me.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:38.580
You see, now the connection of this thing is within itself, all right? But it is to be connected, that's all.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:47.640
There is electricity in it but it is to be connected. That's the only part missing.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:57.220
It's nice we have some things like this to give you analogies [LAUGHTER]. Modern times are very helpful that way, isn't it?

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.560
Can I have some water, please?

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:08.960
- Yes, madam?
- I have a question about nutrition. Is it better to live vegetarian, does meat hurt your system?

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:16.640
You see, in sahaja yoga we, we just consider the personality of a person, a kind of a person he is.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:26.840
Of course the meat of the animals which are bigger than us are injurious to the teeth and all that.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:34.720
But supposing, somebody is a vegetarian and uh.. he is, he needs proteins

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:42.960
so he has to take proteins and if somebody needs uh..  less proteins he has to take carbohydrates.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:49.580
So it is more sort of understanding of a personality. Uh.. We, we do not taboo anything like that

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.280
because it's a wrong idea that vegetarianam takes you to God, it's very wrong.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:01.620
In India, you will find that the worse people are vegetarians, horrible people. [LAUGHTER] They're so cruel,

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:07.400
I'll give you an example, Hitler was a vegetarian, what do you say to that? Strict vegetarian.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:16.280
You see, because you don't have sufficient muscles to control your anger also sometimes. So it's not necessary you have to be vegetarian.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:24.520
It has nothing to do with food but with the prakriti, as you call the nature of a person - what sort of a nature you have and what needs nourishment and looking after.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.040
If the whole world turns to vegetarians, we don't have to kill any animals.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:38.280
No, I mean, what's the use of having too many animals also, you can't give them realization, can you? [LAUGHTER]

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:45.140
And there are many countries where no vegetable grows, for example, Japanese, specially Greenland people. They said,

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:52.060
"What sin have we committed that we have no vegetables here." So, after all, God must have been fair to everyone.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:59.420
But of course, in Australia people eat too much meat, so if they take to vegetarianism a little bit, is a good idea -

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.920
just to balance it out, that's all.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:12.040
[UNCLEAR] You told the story about your grand daughter before [UNCLEAR]

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:18.360
story regarding your grand daughter and something funny she said to You, your daughter

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.760
- What's it?
-  [UNCLEAR] about the Elephant god. I mean, we could hear [UNCLEAR]

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:30.680
[UNCLEAR] your grand daughter said something to You

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.100
about the, about Ganesha.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:41.320
I don't know which one you're say.. I must have given at least 3000, 4000 lectures in only English language.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:46.780
So, I don't know which one you're saying but if you meet Me I, if you'll explain to Me, I'll let you know about it.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.680
I've been to [UNCLEAR]

00:41:52.340 --> 00:42:00.340
- About what?
- [UNCLEAR]
- There was a student [UNCLEAR]

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:08.700
- [UNCLEAR]
- [INAUDIBLE] and the two of them sat down organizing, it was like a tent for her

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:16.600
and she, she would come out. Then she called My daughter. She said, "Mummy come and see my house."

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:23.580
My daughter is very tall, you see. Somehow or the other she managed to get inside. But the

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:30.820
when she got inside so My grand daughter was there, she said, "How do you like my house?"

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:37.440
She said, "Very nice!" So, she said, "What do you have for me to eat?"

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.680
She said, "Mummy, when you go to somebody's house, you don't ask such funny questions." [LAUGHTER]

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:48.380
So, My daughter, you see, couldn't help laughing. She started laughing, the whole [UNCLEAR] house was broken.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:56.720
So she came to Me and she said, "Grandma, You have given no good training to Your daughters." She was very young, she was hardly four years or so.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:04.300
"You have given no good training to Your daughters, she came and broke all my house and I did so much for this."

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.900
But this is just the innocence of a child and said so sweetly.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:19.500
Yeah, you see, the children, you see uh.. children have very strong Mooladhara and they're so innocent

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:27.020
and whatever they say innocently, is so wise, so beautiful. Uh.. that you see, there was a book

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:34.760
'Lady who had An Idea'. She wrote about what children have to say about politics and things and the book was sold overnight.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.840
All the copies were sold out. So, I mean, it's so sweet to listen to them.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.300
The best company is that of children.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:57.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.660
- [INAUDIBLE] sahaja yoga [INAUDIBLE]
- Sahaja, yes, of course.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:15.720
Of course. Sahaja means spontaneous. Because it's a living process, it can only happen spontaneous.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:21.380
There's no need to do all other uh.. acrobats, no need.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.840
- INAUDIBLE]
- Just to do that
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:35.940
Annh, you should. You see, it's all right but the one that is pleasure is all temporary, isn't it? You must achieve joy.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.860
Pleasure is not permanent, it's just temporary. You must [UNCLEAR] of joy.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:52.040
Pleasure seeking people, I have seen, become bored very soon. Better achieve your joy.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:45:01.120
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Beg your pardon.
- Did You have joy all day long [INAUDIBLE]
- [ INAUDIBLE]

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:10.700
- You can have joy all day long after doing yoga.
- Yeah, of course, you are joy.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:18.640
You become joy. Yes, of course, but not the yoga of this

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.360
standing on your heads. [LAUGHTER]

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:28.960
While on the contrary, if you do only the physical side of yoga, you might become a very dry person,

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:35.320
very dry, because right side attack - I'll tell you tomorrow and men can get divorce.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.280
All kinds of things can happen to people who are right-sided. They can be very hot-tempered.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:46.500
We have certain people who are doing Hatha yoga and

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:54.800
you must meet them with the barge poles, very dangerous [INAUDIBLE]. You can't ask them any questions, you see, they just come on you.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:03.980
Can I ask why the right side, in what side of the brain is supposed to be creativity and left side is supposed to be rational side?

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.240
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's she saying?

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.380
She's saying the right side of the brain is supposed to be the creativity

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:20.360
and the left side of the brain is supposed to be the rationality [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:28.500
That I'll tell you tomorrow - it's correct, correct. You have reached the right point, yes, because they cross over, I'll show you, here you can see, see they cross over

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:33.060
The yellow line crosses over the other side and this side

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:40.220
but when we say right sided, we mean the yellow ones who suffer from biliousness.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:47.820
They have too much bile in them that's why we have shown you the yellow one - is the Sun line

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:56.020
and the left side is the Moon line. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow, all right? But should we have realization, now?

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.220
Yes, Mother. [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:06.240
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Pardon?
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:13.360
- What he said?
- [INAUDIBLE] Christianity.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:20.240
Oh, I've, I've very [UNCLEAR -CULMINATION?]  for Christ. Christ was so great - without Him we can't work out sahaja yoga.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:25.820
But Christianity [UNCLEAR] better, that's we cannot -

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:32.000
we better watch out yourself, I mean, the way it is, I can't understand, really.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:45.240
Can't say. Whether it is Christianity or any religion, any, say Islam, anything

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:50.980
say, it's all money-making things, just money-making

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:58.180
[UNCLEAR -BIT OF A?] social money-making stuffs. The best part of it - you may follow any religion whatsoever -

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:06.300
you may be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, whatever it is, Jew, anyone - anybody can commit any, any sin.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:14.520
Can murder anyone, I mean, no body is bound. The religion is not within - it's not innate, it's all outside.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:22.960
But once you are in yoga, it's built-in - that's why, all the saints and all the prophets -

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.600
the real saints and the prophets and the masters, they never did anything that was wrong.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.440
That must happen within us - that's the real transformation.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:53.400
So, no use having any attitude about it - better seek the truth about it.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:49:00.780
Whatever attitude we have, is a mental projection, that's all. Is a whichever way you are made, you see that

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:05.160
Christians think they're the best, Hindus think they're the best, everybody thinks they're the best

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.720
and if you want to locate this, it's rather difficult to see anything good about it.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:15.980
So, there's something wrong - it's all saying for being self-certified.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:21.840
It's better to know the self, that's what everybody has said it.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:29.060
Even Mohammad sahab has said it so clearly - on the contrary, I would say,  He has said something so clearly that you can

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.860
feel the cool breeze and that your hands will speak

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.940
against your will, you witness against , will tell you what's wrong with you.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:43.940
I mean, there's so much they've said. Not only that but

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.680
a complete [UNCLEAR] but Muslims have closed that part that they don't want to hear.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:07.380
So, the artificially given uh..baptism is no great, real thing, it has to be actualized.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:13.060
It has to be actualized, it has to happen.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.980
Then we don't have to go to church - church is within ourselves.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.720
So, what do you say now, should we have?

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:34.560
Now, there's one thing at the very outset, you cannot force it on anyone.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:43.420
Because when you have to achieve ultimate freedom, your freedom has to be respected.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:50.020
So, I cannot force on you. If you want to have your realization really, then only it will work out.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:56.860
So, those who want to have their realization, should be there, otherwise no use, I'll be wasting My energy on them.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:04.660
So, you have to be decide for it first of all, secondly as I've told you before and again I request you

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:09.680
that  forget the past, forget the past

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:15.380
forgive yourself completely and know that you are all capable of becoming

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:25.000
very highly Self-realized people - all of you are, so, don't find faults with you, don't feel guilty,

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:32.640
have confidence. At any age, whatever may be your [UNCLEAR], maybe your [UNCLEAR - NATURE?] -

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:38.100
it's all going to work out. So, have confidence in yourself

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.820
and not to feel guilty at all.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.940
These are the two conditions.

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:59.680
So, the first humble request is that we have to take out the shoes because the Mother Earth is going to help us.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.480
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Talking, talking.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:35.820
Now, take out your shoes just uh.. and put the feet on the Mother Earth - need not take out the socks, it's all right.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.200
What's it?

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.900
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What happened?

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:52.760
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:54.220 --> 00:53:01.980
- [MIXED VOICES]
- It's all right. All right, doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:08.260
It's all right, doesn't matter. It's all right, it's all right, sit comfortably. You have to be comfortable, it's all right.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:15.560
It's all right, you have to sit comfortably and you have to

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:23.560
not to bend too much, not to stretch yourself but comfortably in a straight way.

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:29.720
Now, today I want to tell you, also how you can raise you own Kundalini

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:35.740
and how we work it out. It's very simple and we'll get somebody to tell you that. [UNCLEAR - CAN COME?]

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:44.820
It's very simple, so, first of all we'll show you - keep your eyes open and then you have to close your eyes

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:49.520
because the attention has to go inside. But first he'll tell you, we'll tell you how to do.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:55.080
That the, tomorrow you'll know that the left-side represents our desires

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.620
so you put your left hand towards Me like this on your lap, need not be like that

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:09.960
but could be on your lap itself, and the right hand is to be used for nourishing your own centers.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:19.640
First of all you have to put your hand on your heart. If you have any thing in the pockets better to remove them little bit

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:28.060
so that there's no pressure. In the heart resides the spirit, that's why we first put our hand to our heart.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:36.800
We work only on the left side with our right hand - all the time the left hand being towards Me like that.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:43.580
All right. Now, from the heart you move your right hand

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:51.380
on the left hand side, in the upper portion of your abdomen, here, the left side, press it hard.

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:59.140
Now, this is the center of your mastery, what we call as guru principle - that you become a master.

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:07.540
Then, you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side - press it hard.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:17.260
This is the center of pure knowledge. Knowledge doesn't mean book knowledge or mental knowledge

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:22.700
but knowledge that you feel on your Central Nervous System that is

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:31.100
uh.. the early Christians used to call it as Gnostics - those who knew it on their Central Nervous system. Even

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:36.300
Vedas come from the word vid - means to know on your Central Nervous System.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:45.780
And in the Buddhism they call it a bodha - bodh means also the same thing - you have to know it on your Central Nervous System.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.900
So, this is the pure knowledge, center for the pure knowledge.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:56.380
Then we go back on to the uh.. left hand side

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:03.520
of our abdomen, the upper portion, press it hard there, then to the heart again.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:12.140
Then we move our right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:18.500
Now, this is the center which is mostly catching because people feel guilty.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:27.000
It's a very dangerous one, gives you spondylitis or it gives you also angina. Disease of angina comes from the

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:34.100
clogging of this center - is called as the Left Vishudhdhi, as we call it. Then, you have to turn your head to your right -

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:40.420
do it better because you can push back your hand a little, push your - that's all.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:48.500
Then you have to take your right hand on top of your forehead across, like this, and put down your head.

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:57.800
This is the center where you have to forgive - forgive everyone.

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:05.760
Now, it's easy to say that. Some people think that's difficult to do it but whether you forgive or you don't forgive

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:12.100
you don't do anything - it's a myth. So but, if you say that,

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:20.020
"I forgive everyone," then you get out of the clutches of wrong people, mentally.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:28.380
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head and slowly push back your head towards the sky,

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:34.960
like this - this is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:42.380
without feeling guilty - that is the first condition, the foremost condition - is not to count your mistakes, your past and

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.880
whatever you think you have done wrong. So, without feeling guilty, you have to ask for forgiveness.

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:55.360
Then, you have to stretch your hand fully and the center of your palm is to be placed

00:57:55.580 --> 00:58:01.400
on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood, here.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:08.700
Now, here it is important to understand, push back your fingers completely, push them back and

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:14.860
put a pressure. Now, bend down your head, press it hard

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.400
and move your scalp slowly, clockwise, seven times.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.320
Slowly, push back your fingers.

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:32.620
Pressure should be on the scalp movement, not that your hand is moving but the scalp more.

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:43.820
That's all, one has to do. But still I think, you didn't push back your fingers so next time you'll remember.

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:50.280
Now, you have to close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles also, it helps eyesight, please.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:57.940
Now, please don't open your eyes till I tell you, please don't open, till then. You have to close your eyes,

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:05.100
put your feet on the ground, as much as you can touch and

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:12.560
put your left hand towards Me.and right hand on your heart.

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:21.400
Here, you have to ask Me a question because it's like a Divine computer that works

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:27.800
and when you become the Divine computer, you'll work the same way. So, you ask a first question to Me -

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:33.060
you can call Me, Shri Mataji or you can call Me, Mother - whatever you think it proper.

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:40.920
[UNCLEAR - THAT?] "Mother, am I the spirit?" Ask this question in your heart

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:47.180
three times. "Mother, am I the spirit?" Have faith in yourself, have full confidence in yourself.

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:51.260
You ask yourself, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.740
Keep your eyes shut, don't open them.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:08.520
Now, if you are the spirit, you are your master because your spirit is your guide.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:15.700
So now, put down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard,

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:22.240
keeping the left hand towards Me, here you ask another very important question three times,

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:30.240
"Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guru?" - Ask this question three times.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:59.420
As I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force it on you -

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:06.540
not even the pure knowledge. So now, you have to ask for pure knowledge.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.260
Put down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, press it hard.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:23.760
And now, you have to say, "Mother, please give Me pure, pure knowledge." In the glory of your own freedom, you have to ask Me,

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:29.520
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge." This you have to say six times

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.260
because this center has got six petals, so you have to say it six times.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:43.040
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge." In Sanskrit called as Shudh Vidya.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.820
As soon as you say that, the Kundalini starts rising. So now,

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:21.940
we have to nourish the higher centers so that Her movement becomes easier.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:28.900
So now, please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it hard.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:41.120
To open this center, with full confidence, you have to say ten times, with full confidence in yourself,

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:47.060
"Mother, I am my own master." Please say it ten times.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:54.860
"Mother, I am my own master." Please say it ten times, asserting.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.380
This is very good for people who have been to wrong masters.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:22.320
The greatest truth about yourself is that, you are not this body,

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.200
you are not this mind,

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.920
you are not this ego, you are not this, these emotions, your thought, your work -

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:38.840
you are the spirit. So now, raise your right hand on your heart

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:50.120
and now with full confidence say, you have to say twelve times, "Mother, I am the spirit."

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:57.780
Put it on your heart, the right hand and say with full confidence

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:04.300
twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure spirit."

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:30.760
Now, one has to understand

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:37.520
that Divine power, which is All-pervading, is the power

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:48.760
that is the ocean of bliss and knowledge, is the ocean

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:57.520
of joy but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.740
and you cannot do anything that it cannot forgive.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:09.100
Whatever you may have done, please rely on the power of that ocean of forgiveness

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:15.440
and forgive yourself. So, please raise your right hand

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:22.000
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your right,

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:28.640
turn your head towards right - as much as you can, push back your hand.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:37.100
At this centers, one has to say with full confidence,

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:44.580
with full confidence,"Mother, I am not guilty at all, " sixteen times.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:50.220
"Mother, I am not guilty at all, " sixteen times.

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:28.300
Now, as I told you, that some people say, it's very difficult to forgive others

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:35.420
but whether you forgive or you don't forgive, it's a myth. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:42.540
So, have confidence in yourself and now, raise your right hand

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:48.580
on your forehead across and bend your head. At this point,

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:57.460
you have to say, without counting people, without thinking about them,

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.920
just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:08.580
You say it from your heart, not how many times but say it from your heart, which is very important.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:28.320
Now, take back your right hand on to the back side of your head, where the optic lobe is

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:35.880
and now push your head upward, as much as you can, resting on that hand.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:42.280
Here again, without feeling guilty, without counting what mistakes you have committed

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:49.000
for your own satisfaction, you have to say from your heart, not how many times,

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:57.380
"Oh Divine, please forgive, forgive me if I have done any mistakes."

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.980
Say it from your heart.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:42.160
Now, stretch your hand fully and put the center of your palm

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.180
on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:54.560
in your childhood. Press it hard. Now, really push back your fingers, as much as you can,

01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.400
to put a pressure on that area and now bend your head.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.860
Please move your hand seven times

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:14.560
in a clockwise manner. But here again, I cannot get over your

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:22.220
freedom, in the sense that I cannot insult your freedom. I respect you, so I would

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:28.020
say that, you have to ask for your Self-realization. So, you have to say seven times,

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:37.240
"Mother, please give me Self-realization." I cannot force it on you. Seven times.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:45.640

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS IN TO THE MICROPHONE]

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:39.800
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS IN TO THE MICROPHONE]

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:48.780
Now please, take down your hands, both the hands and slowly open your eyes, slowly open your eyes.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.920
Slowly. Now, put both the hands towards Me, like this.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:01.740
Now, put the right hand towards Me, little higher like that -

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:08.580
right hand and now, put down your head and with your left hand you see here

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.740
in the fontanel bone area, if there's a cool breeze coming?

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:20.460
Now, don't doubt it - there's no air conditioning or anything working it out that thing. From inside you'll feel the cool breeze coming in.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.020
Bend your head. Now, don't doubt because then you go in the lower level of thought.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:32.340
Just see for yourself, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:48.140
Now, please put the  left hand towards Me, like this higher and now, again bend your head

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:54.820
and see for yourself with the right hand, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:01.040
Sometimes there could be little heat also, doesn't matter, it will disappear. If there's heat in the body, it has to come out.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:13.000
Once again, put left hand towards Me - right hand again,

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.360
towards Me. Once again, put right hand towards Me and see with your left hand

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:25.840
bending your head, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:34.000
Good! Now, please put your both the hands up like this

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.700
and push back your head, push back as much as you can, and now you can ask a question,

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:46.960
"Mother, is this  the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the cool breeze of the All-Pervading Divine power?"

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:53.500
You ask this question three times, just ask this question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" -

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:58.160
three times, please. Now,

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.500
Now, take down your hands, please take down your hands.

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:15.560
You feel very relaxed, very relaxed and

[UNCLEAR] Now see, if you're feeling the cool breeze in your hand?

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:31.160
Now, those people who have felt the cool breeze in their hand or the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area,

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.860
please, raise both your hands.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:47.080
Ah, just imagine! You're all saints now, so I better say

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:53.000
I'll bow to you. May God bless you! It's beautiful, started with so many.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:58.460
Some did not feel, doesn't matter. We'll have it tomorrow - you're all going to feel it.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:04.320
So nice, but now don't think about it. When you come down,

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.820
don't think about it - just be silent.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:15.240
Sleep well tonight. Tomorrow again we'll work it out and fix it up.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.580
May God bless you! May god bless you!

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:29.560
May God bless you! We have a very nice center here and I'm sure we want our progress very well here.

It's not well, so many, really! We, we 'll have to work it out tomorrow morning also.

- There may be some problem [UNCLEAR]
