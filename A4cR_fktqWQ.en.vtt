00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Just read, Ellie.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.880
I see.

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.640
So Auntie Jane met me at Vashi at the hospital.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.120
And she showed me a white sari with some print on it.

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.240
And it wasn't a very special sari, but she loved it so much.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.800
And she said they all got saris when they all

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.400
came to India at the time.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.800
And because she was so tall, the sari

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.880
was actually quite short for her.

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.600
So she asked me to help her to extend the sari.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.000
So I actually got a fall attached on top of it

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.680
so that she could wear that sari because it

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.640
was just too short for her.

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.880
And the interesting thing, so I started talking to her.

15
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.360
And I said, apparently she had been a carpenter before that.

16
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.800
She was working with wood.

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560
And so I said, what was it like?

18
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.000
What did Srimathji say to you when she found out

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.280
that you work with wood?

20
00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.040
And she told her not to wear pants,

21
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.560
but to wear a skirt when she was working.

22
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.760
So I said, and did you?

23
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.120
And she said, yes, I did.

24
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.920
And I said, well, how did that work when

25
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.640
you were carpentering around?

26
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.600
And she actually showed me how she very demurely bent her legs

27
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.800
and laid a plank of wood across her lap and sawed wood.

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.480
She said it did make a difference.

29
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.960
So I found it really very touching.

30
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.040
And it was so obvious her delight and reverence

31
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.200
for that sari, which actually would look very ordinary.

32
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.000
And yeah, the idea of keeping it and preserving it

33
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.080
and making it long enough for her.

34
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.720
And I felt kind of honored that she gave me this little job.

35
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120
Yeah, it was nice.

36
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.240
It was beautiful.

37
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.520
I think I just have to, for the UK,

38
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.560
I just have to specify that pants, of course,

39
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.160
is the American for trousers.

40
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.640
Yes.

41
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.120
Yeah.

42
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.280
Yes.

43
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.240
Yes, I'm also tall.

44
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.160
And I had to find out from the years

45
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.200
that you couldn't just go and buy a sari.

46
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.440
You had to make sure it was long enough.

47
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.000
And I think it's six meters, isn't it?

48
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.600
Are there other two lengths?

49
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.240
Or maybe more than two lengths.

50
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.240
But six meters, I think, is what I need to get the folds.

51
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.760
The pleats.

52
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.240
Yeah.

53
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.360
But and also the width.

54
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360
You must need a wider one.

55
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.560
Yes, I meant the width in this case.

56
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.800
Yes.

57
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.400
The fall is at the bottom of the sari

58
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.320
to prevent it from getting really worn and torn

59
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.920
as you walk against it.

60
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.400
But if you're extremely tall, you

61
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.640
need to extend the width so that you have something to tuck in.

62
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.160
Yeah.

63
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.880
So yeah, I got, so I actually attached a fall on top.

64
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.760
I got it attached by a tailor.

65
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.040
Oh, at the top.

66
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.680
Oh, how clever.

67
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.200
Yes.

68
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.120
Of course, yes.

69
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000
How clever.

70
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.920
Yes.

71
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.640
Good idea.

72
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.040
That was nice.

73
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.240
Marilyn, I would like to say a small story.

74
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800
Yes, please do.

75
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.960
When Simasangi came to Barcelona,

76
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.600
she brought some saris for us, for Spanish people.

77
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.320
I was fairly new because I entered in 1992.

78
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.480
But I settled more in 1993.

79
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.120
And when she came to Barcelona, we flew from Madrid to there.

80
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.320
And we were in a residence.

81
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.760
And when Simasangi arrived, she brought

82
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.760
a big box full of saris.

83
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.920
And they announced on the speaker,

84
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.600
we were eating at the moment in the restaurant.

85
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.560
And they announced, oh, Simasangi

86
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.240
brought some saris for you so those that want some,

87
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.960
they can come up.

88
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.760
And I jump up my chair.

89
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.600
And I said, oh, I'm going, I'm going.

90
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.960
I want to be the first to get one because I

91
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.280
didn't have any saris.

92
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.080
And I jump.

93
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.560
And then another man who was from Malaga in front of me,

94
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.960
he said, oh, no, keep on eating.

95
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.760
Don't rush.

96
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.440
Don't rush.

97
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.480
Because if the saris for you will be for you,

98
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.040
you just have faith, have faith.

99
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.840
And I sat down again.

100
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.440
And I was eating.

101
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.800
And I said, yes, oh, Simasangi is the goddess.

102
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.680
So the sari will be for me.

103
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.400
So when I finished, I went up.

104
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.560
And the saris had run out.

105
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.800
Everybody has got their saris.

106
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.120
And when I arrived there, I looked at the man who says,

107
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.000
your sari will be there waiting for you, you know.

108
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.200
And I said, oh, gosh, I don't have any sari.

109
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.240
And I wanted so much.

110
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.680
And I was told to have faith and wait.

111
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.960
And I was patient.

112
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.000
And now look what I got.

113
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then one of the ladies, the Spanish lady,

114
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.960
says this, have this one.

115
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.000
Because I already got one.

116
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So you can have this one.

117
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.160
And she gave it to me.

118
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.560
And I wear that sari many times.

119
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.060
Yeah.

120
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.960
Yeah, that's beautiful.

121
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.920
For me, it was a tremendous lesson.

122
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.200
Then also, once I went for her birthday,

123
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.400
I don't remember the year.

124
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.480
And I bought a special sari.

125
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.760
And I went with some people that didn't understand

126
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.040
about the silk.

127
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.240
And you know that they said, oh, silk, the seller, this silk

128
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.640
is silk.

129
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.880
And the person who was with me says, I know about patterns.

130
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.160
Because I design.

131
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.320
And it's very beautiful design.

132
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.280
But I don't know much about it is silk, pure silk, or not.

133
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.560
In fact, I put it for the birthday.

134
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.040
And it turned out not to be pure silk.

135
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.360
It was a mixture with polyester or something like that.

136
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.280
It's pretty beautiful.

137
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.200
But I was really, really disappointed.

138
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.080
Afterwards, I was a little bit ill.

139
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.320
And they were going to a factory where

140
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.600
they sell saris with the old patterns, the mothers.

141
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.720
And I said, I want a blue one with silver pattern.

142
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.040
So I gave them the money to bring it to me.

143
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:04.960
And when they arrived, the sari was, how do you call it, violet.

144
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.360
Not violet, morado.

145
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.080
Oh, gosh.

146
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.440
Not purple.

147
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.640
Purple, that's right.

148
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.400
It was purple.

149
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.320
And this is, whenever I got my purple sari,

150
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.880
yes, I always said, oh, this is my blue sari.

151
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.080
But there you are.

152
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.040
It's nice to have a purple sari with silver flavoring.

153
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:42.040
So as long as I have a very beautiful, expensive, proper

154
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.600
sari.

155
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.800
But I have to add more things because I'm very tall and fat.

156
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.600
So in it, add in cloth so that it will fit me.

157
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.080
Does anyone else have any stories

158
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.280
that they want to share while we're still recording the story?

159
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.200
Got a couple of things that have sprung to mind,

160
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.480
but I don't know how long, how much time we have left.

161
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.720
Oh, plenty.

162
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.400
Thank you so much, Gauri and Roz.

163
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.960
I really enjoyed the stories.

164
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.640
And they're both very different.

165
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:29.760
And Roz, when you mentioned about these Punjabi

166
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.280
that you bought, I'm sure it was very beautiful.

167
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.680
But it just sprung to mind that I

168
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.720
think once I was wearing a Punjabi in front of Mother.

169
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.200
And Mother said something like, yes, yes, very nice.

170
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.520
But all the vibrations will fall off it straight away.

171
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.640
When we wear a sari and we're in the strong vibrations

172
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.200
of a puja, because a sari is the Kundalini.

173
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.400
Of course, it goes around, represents the Kundalini.

174
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.080
So in a puja, it holds the vibration

175
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.240
that it keeps them for a very long time.

176
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.920
But she said, you wear a Punjabi,

177
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.720
it just all falls off straight away.

178
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.640
But we got someone to tell me that.

179
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.520
Don't really do it.

180
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.160
It's the lady who brought me to Sahaj.

181
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.520
She did tell me that.

182
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.960
I've always remembered that, that in puja,

183
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.200
the pleats of the sari hold all the beautiful vibrations.

184
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.400
So that was that sprung to mind.

185
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.120
Wow.

186
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.080
I didn't know that.

187
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.040
That's so important to know.

188
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.560
And in a way, I was quite young once I was wearing a Punjabi.

189
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.520
I didn't have the dupatta, the modesty.

190
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.440
She was very insistent to wear the dupatta to cover.

191
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.160
So it's just all this very motherly attention to detail.

192
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.360
So many memories about, oh, gosh,

193
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.600
comical things as well, like Manda Keeney mentioned

194
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.920
about the very tall yogini and the sari,

195
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.440
which wasn't very wide enough.

196
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.040
And I don't remember where we were,

197
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.200
but she's actually been getting ready for puja

198
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.800
in her own hotel room.

199
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.680
And of course, she could get ready, boom, boom, boom.

200
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.800
I mean, I'm sure people have seen her put a sari

201
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.800
on in two seconds flat, on, perfect, never falls off.

202
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.440
But she did so, it helps.

203
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.000
And I said, even without a full length mirror,

204
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.680
I said something like, even without a full length mirror,

205
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.560
because I don't know about you guys,

206
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.160
but some of you need to see if it's off the showing ankle.

207
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.440
It doesn't look very elegant.

208
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.480
And I'd said something like, oh, it helps sometimes

209
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.520
with a full length mirror.

210
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.440
And she sort of smiled.

211
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.400
And then we were somewhere,

212
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.440
and she was in the car and she looked,

213
00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.120
we were looking out the window,

214
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.000
and there's a yogini showing about this much ankle.

215
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.480
And she might have looked at me, she goes,

216
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.880
I don't think she has a full length mirror.

217
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.480
It was just this sort of, you know,

218
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.920
this sort of humor that she would come out with.

219
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.720
Very, very funny.

220
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.560
So many funny stories.

221
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.800
Carole, are you recording this?

222
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.920
Yes, yes, we're still recording.

223
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.480
No, I don't want to kind of, you know,

224
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.240
it's just so many, so many things.

225
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.560
Whenever she was getting ready for puja

226
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.400
and always paying particular attention

227
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.360
to the color of the sari, the pattern,

228
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.920
particularly one puja, there was one,

229
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.680
I believe it was the Sahasrara puja in Vienna,

230
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.200
that very strong puja that Gauri will remember, no doubt.

231
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.200
And she was wearing a puja sari.

232
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.960
She chose it specifically, which had the squares,

233
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.080
you know, golden squares.

234
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.120
Oh yes, Saraswale, yeah.

235
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.000
Yeah, you remember that one then she said,

236
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
this represents the mariadis of Sri Ganesha.

237
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.280
Yeah.

238
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.200
In these squares.

239
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200
I think I remember that.

240
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.360
I actually remember her saying that.

241
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.680
I don't know if she mentioned it in the puja,

242
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.880
so I remember her choosing it and mentioning it,

243
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.720
but she made me mention it.

244
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.280
Yeah, I remember hearing that though.

245
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.960
Yeah, because you were there, yeah.

246
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.800
Definitely.

247
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.360
So always great attention to detail.

248
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.680
There was no such thing as a casual choice,

249
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.120
how she would choose colors and designs,

250
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.360
obviously for a very deep reason.

251
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.000
And the gifts that she would give

252
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.240
always have a meaning, of course.

253
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.040
I mean, one of the first saris,

254
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.720
I remember I'd gone to her home

255
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.040
and I was wearing maybe a little bit shy

256
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.280
because I bought this jacket in Camden Lock Market,

257
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.200
you know, it was sort of trendy those days.

258
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.560
You went down to Camden Lock

259
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.040
and you could buy a genuine Chanel jacket

260
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.320
for 50p or something.

261
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.560
And I was wearing this sort of secondhand thing

262
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.840
and I was very embarrassed because I thought,

263
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.680
oh, it's secondhand, I shouldn't wear it.

264
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.240
In front of mother.

265
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.760
So I went in with the jacket and then took it off.

266
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.000
And later she came from her room

267
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and she brought me a sari in exact color of that jacket.

268
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.080
And she said, oh, that pink really suits you.

269
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.400
You know, so it was so sweet

270
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.200
how you think she doesn't see anything,

271
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.960
but you know, she sort of saw out of the corner of her eye

272
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.160
and came with this pink color.

273
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.960
And years and years later in Ganapati Pule on the,

274
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.040
you know, when she bought the wedding saris

275
00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.920
for the guys to choose for the brides.

276
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.520
So it was all, she chose them

277
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.240
and they would come and buy them.

278
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.680
So Enzo had bought one for me, you know,

279
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.600
he'd chosen a purple one, I think,

280
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.120
lovely sari, purple with zari.

281
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.960
And then he bought it with one of those watches of rupees

282
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.080
that, you know, Roz humorously described.

283
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.160
We're all going around with these watches of rupees,

284
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.000
weren't we?

285
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.400
And then he'd gone, taken the sari,

286
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.040
and then later on he saw Sri Mataji and she said,

287
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.800
oh, I don't know where I've chosen Danya's wedding sari.

288
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.680
And she fished out this pink one,

289
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.200
exact same color that day, you know,

290
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.360
when I was about, I don't know, 16 or something,

291
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.200
as she'd given me.

292
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.160
So he had to buy two, of course he couldn't say,

293
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.720
oh, I've already got one mother.

294
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.600
So he coughed up another watch of rupees.

295
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.000
So I got pink, pink that day, pink the color of love.

296
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.960
Anyway, I better stop there because there's so many.

297
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.880
I'm glad I'm not the only one then that was going around

298
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.920
and dealing with this huge amount of money in my bag.

299
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.200
Yeah, it's so funny.

300
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.080
And all those cotton ones, Glenda, Gauri, that we got.

301
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.360
Some of us, I have to admit, when we got our colors,

302
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.320
we weren't so gracious saying, oh, this is Nabi.

303
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.920
This, you know, I remember if you really hated,

304
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.760
shouldn't use the word hate, it's too strong.

305
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.600
But if you were, like, let's say,

306
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.760
I remember my mom wasn't fond of the color orange.

307
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.680
Yeah.

308
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.400
And of course the first sari mother gave her was orange.

309
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.720
An orange one, yes.

310
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.560
And she set up a new one.

311
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.720
First sari got to my husband was an orange one

312
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.520
and I had an aversion to orange as well.

313
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.440
And she said, orange is the color of detachment.

314
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.280
Yeah.

315
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.080
So that's sort of interesting.

316
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.480
Anyway, that feels like, you know, it's a sort of,

317
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.040
what is it, one pound to start, five to stop.

318
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.960
So it's interesting because telling even some

319
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.200
of those stories, there isn't loads of them

320
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.560
are not in the memories book I've just put.

321
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.360
So it's telling the stories that it brings it all up.

322
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.200
So it's lovely to-

323
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.000
Yes, you remember when somebody else says something,

324
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.120
you remember exactly how it was.

325
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.120
Absolutely.

326
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.960
All right.

327
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.920
Yeah.

328
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.440
Like that sari that Chumaraji described it.

329
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.280
I remember that.

330
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.080
I remember that now and that you mentioned it.

331
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080
The sari she wore for Sarashade.

332
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.920
Yeah.

333
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.800
Yeah.

334
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.080
1985.

335
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.920
Yeah.

336
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.760
Yeah.

337
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.120
Caroline, there is one little story.

338
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.200
I don't know if I'm interrupting Dania.

339
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.520
I'm not interrupting you on my Dania.

340
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.160
I said, I'll stop there otherwise.

341
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.000
Okay.

342
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
We're getting India tour and unfortunately

343
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.360
I can't remember the girl's name,

344
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.920
but there was an Australian,

345
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.520
well, I was in my thirties.

346
00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.600
I was in my middle thirties or early thirties

347
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.720
and she was probably about the same.

348
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.600
She married an Indian chap on that tour,

349
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.400
but she was a real character.

350
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.520
I really, I've never been able to remember that.

351
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.360
I've got photographs of myself with her

352
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.320
and we were given that pile of cotton saris

353
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.000
as you already mentioned.

354
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.560
I mean, there were, some of them were lovely.

355
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.840
I saved a pink one and another one for years

356
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.520
and years and years, because it was such nice.

357
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.480
They were so lovely and cool in India.

358
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.480
Anyway, we got these piles of saris

359
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.120
and they were all very similar, weren't they?

360
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.440
I mean, very many of us got the same ones,

361
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.320
but this girl, I think she may have come later to the tour

362
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.240
and she got her pile of saris and there was ducks on it.

363
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.320
There were little ducks on this sari

364
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.280
and we just went, oh, how sweet.

365
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.920
Trust you to get that, you know,

366
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.360
because she was such a personality, a strong character.

367
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.760
Did you say ducks, like quack quack?

368
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.360
Yeah, quack quack ducks, yeah.

369
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.400
Little ducks all over the sari,

370
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.680
like a line of them around her sari.

371
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.840
And we said, I said, if you bought,

372
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.840
you know, I think she said,

373
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.480
everybody asks the same question.

374
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.880
Did you go and buy that sari?

375
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.720
She said, no, no, it was in the pile that Sharataji gave me.

376
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.560
And I'm like, oh, that's Sharataji's little play,

377
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.760
you know, with you, because she was a real character.

378
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.600
She would never think before she spoke.

379
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.920
She just said things, we're all laughing,

380
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.360
but this sari really suited her personality, you know.

381
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.520
So I never saw another one like that, actually.

382
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.200
With ducks on.

383
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.840
Just, yeah, not a story in itself at all,

384
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.800
but that's just taken me back, Rosalind,

385
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.440
to getting my pile of saris on the India tour.

386
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.120
It's just amazing, it's amazing.

387
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.160
We were so lucky.

388
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.440
Yeah.

389
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.400
Also, she gave the towels,

390
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.160
these striped, blue and white striped towels,

391
00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.080
which we still have one of them.

392
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.560
With the sewing machine,

393
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.320
I've sewn it together again and again and again.

394
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.400
And now it's just like a saving piece.

395
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.000
We used them for years and years.

396
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.400
She said, she gave them to us and she said,

397
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.560
these towels are such good quality, she said to us.

398
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.600
I mean, and bringing them back from India,

399
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.400
because Mother handed them to us, these towels.

400
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.560
Just amazing.

401
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.560
Yeah, Chris has only just stopped using his, I think.

402
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.120
I've just remembered a funny one about the towels,

403
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.040
if I may, it's sort of the first India tour I went on.

404
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.800
We were told, don't bring towels.

405
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.760
You only bring one dress,

406
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.840
because you're going to get saris, you're going to get.

407
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.160
So because we had to keep empty suitcases

408
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.080
for bringing things for Indian yogis and for Shri Mataji.

409
00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.000
So, didn't bring the towel, only had one dress.

410
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.960
And the things that we were given were also random.

411
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.080
In my suitcase, amongst other things,

412
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.720
I had tins of Frankfurter sausages, custard.

413
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.600
And I thought, oh, this must be really like the specialty

414
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.200
for maybe the Indian yogis,

415
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.400
so they can't get, or maybe from Mother's family.

416
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.640
So I've been carting around these tins of Frankfurter

417
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.680
sausages and custard for quite a while, actually.

418
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.680
Quite a good while before.

419
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.280
And no towel manifested, I think for a good two weeks,

420
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.680
and the saris were delayed.

421
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.320
So I was using a petticoat as a hidden, you know.

422
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.560
Oh, it's so funny, Dania.

423
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.640
It's such a lesson in detachment.

424
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.680
You did what you were told,

425
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.960
but the best thing was that when we got to,

426
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.440
I think it was Pune or Nashik or somewhere,

427
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.760
I can't remember, but I thought,

428
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.560
finally, we were asked to deliver the goods.

429
00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.760
So I delivered dutifully these tins of Frankfurters

430
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.920
and tins of custard.

431
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.680
You know what, we had to eat that night,

432
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.000
what we were served.

433
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.760
So, you know, it was obviously,

434
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.920
we were probably all moaning about spicy food or something.

435
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.360
And there you go, you can have those, you know.

436
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.640
They weren't for the family or for the Indians, you know.

437
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.360
They were served up.

438
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.640
I tell you, once we get talking about India Tours,

439
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.080
I would love to sit for about a week with all the yogis

440
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.920
and talk about the stories from India Tours.

441
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.680
When you look back now, at the time,

442
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.800
they all seemed quite serious when we were young yogis,

443
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.680
you know, in the beginning years.

444
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.000
But now we look back, they are hilarious, aren't they?

445
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.840
You know.

446
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.680
Just jokes.

447
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.160
You were always bringing Kraft cheese in cans

448
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.120
and things like that.

449
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.040
I remember the...

450
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.720
I'm told to bring polyester material for the Indians.

451
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.880
I loved it, because the Aussies used to bring baked beans,

452
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.920
biscuits, it was great.

453
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.200
You know, we were so frugal in England.

454
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.120
We were very austere and quite fanatic, I think.

455
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.800
And it was an absolute revelation for me

456
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.360
when I went on my first India Tour

457
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.720
and I met you and Cheryl and all these wonderful,

458
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.720
open-hearted, normal, joyful, funny people.

459
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.520
And then, you know, because I think you took pity on me,

460
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.920
because I was like a kid, you know,

461
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.440
so skinny 16-year-old and shared all the biscuits

462
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.800
and baked beans and it was great.

463
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.440
And then we had a lovely, lovely time.

464
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.360
Magic, wasn't it?

465
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.200
Absolute magic.

466
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.000
The greatest fun I had, was a great revelation for me,

467
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.680
was a whole bunch of Australians came

468
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.600
on one of those early Tours,

469
00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.640
possibly the first or maybe second one I went on,

470
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.760
about 90, 91.

471
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.360
We had so much fun with the Australians.

472
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.040
I think the English and Australians do have a kind of rapport

473
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.360
somewhere along the line.

474
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.720
So, absolutely.

475
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.280
The things we got up to, honestly.

476
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.120
Great.

477
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.280
That was the year that Dania and I got married,

478
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.920
in fact, 1991.

479
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.920
Yes.

480
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.800
To our respective husbands, obviously.

481
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.640
That's right.

482
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.000
We got married on the same year, did you?

483
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.840
You two.

484
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.680
Yeah.

485
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.520
Wow.

486
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.680
That would be one of my stories, the marriage, 1984.

487
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.240
When I got married, 40 years this year.

488
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.320
Yeah, so brilliant.

489
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.800
So we'll be hearing that in February then, Gary.

490
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.680
Yes, marriage stories, yeah.

491
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.520
Okay, ladies.

492
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.280
Well, I think it's time to slowly draw this to a close.

493
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.240
It's been a wonderful evening as ever.

494
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.000
So I'm going to, for the second time,

495
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.760
I'm going to stop the recording now.
