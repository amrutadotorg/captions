00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:19.836
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:26.955
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:35.386
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:43.576
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:52.856
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:58.015
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:12.866
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

00:06:12.866 --> 00:06:20.566
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

00:06:20.566 --> 00:06:26.826
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

00:06:26.826 --> 00:06:40.695
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:50.466
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:59.736
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:12.766
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:25.065
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:44.056
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

00:07:44.056 --> 00:07:53.066
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.106
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:08:02.056
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

00:08:02.056 --> 00:08:06.406
He was a very loving and a kind person.

00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:09.846
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:17.966
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

00:08:17.966 --> 00:08:26.145
You can’t help it.

00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:26.492
What are they saying?

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.075
Who is it?

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:45.362
What happened?

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.643
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:17.001
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:21.269
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.560
What is it?

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:27.003
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:36.276
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

00:09:41.413 --> 00:09:44.882
They are very good at fighting.

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:50.020
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

00:09:51.537 --> 00:09:55.994
They have no understanding,

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.618
always ready to fight,

00:09:58.819 --> 00:10:01.223
even with swords.

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:09.085
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:14.660
This beautiful new building has been erected

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:16.865
for our classical music.

00:10:17.048 --> 00:10:19.547
They fought even on this

00:10:19.748 --> 00:10:25.959
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:30.694
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:35.488
They fight for some reason or the other.

00:10:36.123 --> 00:10:39.336
They have no shame, nothing.

00:10:40.552 --> 00:10:46.966
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:53.652
No maturity at all.

00:10:56.034 --> 00:11:01.827
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:05.219
And the music has grown so much.

00:11:08.163 --> 00:11:10.743
Everybody has the same experience.

00:11:10.918 --> 00:11:15.191
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:19.652
and I am fed up with it.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.957
Everybody is complaining about something.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.822
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:28.023 --> 00:11:32.500
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:37.119
and they have given so much knowledge.

00:11:38.226 --> 00:11:42.963
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

00:11:43.386 --> 00:11:45.828
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:49.648
They will fight even in their name,

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:53.826
keep behaving foolishly.

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:59.455
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

00:12:03.253 --> 00:12:06.546
They just don’t understand peaceful living

00:12:06.737 --> 00:12:12.503
and absorbing everything peacefully.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.446
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:23.942
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.418
"Are they uneducated people?".

00:12:26.609 --> 00:12:30.141
No, no, they are very well educated,

00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:34.482
but very quarrelsome.

00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:38.028
And why they fight, they only know.

00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:45.511
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

00:12:47.728 --> 00:12:50.569
and be a bit peaceful.

00:12:51.046 --> 00:12:53.086
At least try.

00:12:53.553 --> 00:12:56.347
We want to change, isn’t it?

00:12:57.323 --> 00:13:01.140
Instead of finding faults with others,

00:13:01.326 --> 00:13:05.381
see what is wrong with yourself.

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:11.692
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

00:13:12.035 --> 00:13:14.399
at Nagpur.

00:13:14.582 --> 00:13:19.389
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:26.018
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

00:13:26.484 --> 00:13:30.531
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:39.299
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.984
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

00:13:42.183 --> 00:13:45.794
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:48.793
When you think of just making money somehow,

00:13:49.032 --> 00:13:52.262
run helter-skelter for it,

00:13:55.244 --> 00:14:02.997
have such a low manner thinking,

00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:08.757
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:14.504
What should we call them?

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.274
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:20.089
We must achieve some good state”.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.892
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

00:14:24.093 --> 00:14:28.302
So [all of you] decide today

00:14:28.525 --> 00:14:32.361
to stop fighting from now onwards

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.155
and stop being greedy for money,

00:14:38.367 --> 00:14:40.968
which is too much in Maharashtra.

00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:44.730
Here greed for money is amazing.

00:14:45.867 --> 00:14:50.617
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:57.987
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:01.767
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.464
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

00:15:06.665 --> 00:15:09.534
and live gracefully

00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:12.646
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

00:15:12.853 --> 00:15:17.313
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.847
You have not found a place to sit,

00:15:22.048 --> 00:15:24.921
or you have not found a place to see…

00:15:25.276 --> 00:15:29.689
Is this a political meeting or what?

00:15:33.282 --> 00:15:37.076
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

00:15:37.277 --> 00:15:41.737
when I saw you I had to say it.

00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:47.425
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

00:15:47.626 --> 00:15:51.497
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:52.087 --> 00:15:55.118
There is no other way to correct this.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:58.122
Everyone should live with affection.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.913
If you cannot behave yourself,

00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:04.619
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

00:16:07.882 --> 00:16:10.748
It is our Baba special character

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:13.511
that he never got angry with anybody,

00:16:13.712 --> 00:16:17.052
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:22.300
and never complained about anybody.

00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:25.522
He would praise everybody.

00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:28.766
I used to get misguided

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:32.870
how can everybody have such a good state.

00:16:33.211 --> 00:16:35.479
I would never understand.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.434
But Baba brought people together with love,

00:16:40.748 --> 00:16:43.335
it may be just anybody.

00:16:43.532 --> 00:16:47.953
He would never sit in My car,

00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:53.214
never visit to My house.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:57.721
He was very selfless and understanding.

00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:01.070
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:04.230
but he was never so rude.

00:17:04.426 --> 00:17:07.723
Till the end He was not rude.

00:17:07.924 --> 00:17:11.487
Such a great personality he was.

00:17:12.009 --> 00:17:14.486
You have joined this place,

00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:18.147
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.996
Now, this,

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:38.981
we have built this temple for music

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.054
and other form of arts.

00:17:43.253 --> 00:17:46.816
Your children must progress in these fields.

00:17:47.054 --> 00:17:50.123
They must understand our classical music.

00:17:50.322 --> 00:17:57.163
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.416
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

00:18:04.707 --> 00:18:07.199
then what’s the use?

00:18:07.552 --> 00:18:11.091
You may not be a student of this place,

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:15.718
still, you must have knowledge about music.

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:22.264
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:28.462
you cannot enjoy music.

00:18:29.186 --> 00:18:32.129
I request you all

00:18:32.924 --> 00:18:37.514
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

00:18:40.584 --> 00:18:44.247
and develop goodness within you.

00:18:44.855 --> 00:18:47.602
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:47.803 --> 00:18:51.227
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:53.585
you cannot reap anything.

00:18:53.786 --> 00:18:56.172
I sometimes feel that.

00:18:56.373 --> 00:18:58.285
But now things are better

00:18:58.486 --> 00:19:04.238
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.551
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

00:19:10.488 --> 00:19:13.487
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:16.192
understand the sahaja way,

00:19:16.393 --> 00:19:20.376
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:23.302
If you don't learn this,

00:19:23.668 --> 00:19:25.842
it is useless.

00:19:27.142 --> 00:19:30.284
There are many music schools around.

00:19:30.485 --> 00:19:32.929
Everywhere there are music schools.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.079
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.335
it is better not to learn music at all.

00:19:41.464 --> 00:19:46.863
So I request you all, please,

00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:50.072
that now with this music,

00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:54.435
bring the music of your life

00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:57.761
into your day-to-day practice.

00:19:59.507 --> 00:20:01.978
Unless you follow this,

00:20:06.565 --> 00:20:11.066
this program will not be accomplished.

00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:16.523
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

00:20:16.724 --> 00:20:20.488
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

00:20:20.689 --> 00:20:24.298
The second problem here is about making money.

00:20:24.499 --> 00:20:27.789
they are not leaving it at all.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.138
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:33.749
They don't understand.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.894
How did people here get this greed?

00:20:38.095 --> 00:20:41.448
It has spread so much

00:20:44.382 --> 00:20:47.430
that I am fed up.

00:20:47.835 --> 00:20:51.887
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

00:20:52.088 --> 00:20:55.680
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

00:20:55.881 --> 00:20:58.353
there should be rhythm in our lives.

00:20:58.554 --> 00:21:01.877
Instead of being rhythmic,

00:21:02.078 --> 00:21:07.340
fighting all the time is not proper.

00:21:09.422 --> 00:21:12.130
Thinking bad about others

00:21:12.336 --> 00:21:14.518
and seeing only self interest

00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:16.919
it's a wrong quality.

00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:21.448
Now forget what happened in the past.

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:23.936
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

00:21:24.137 --> 00:21:26.556
who are understanding, loving,

00:21:26.757 --> 00:21:31.228
and who will bring all people together.

00:21:34.937 --> 00:21:39.638
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:42.679
And the thing is,

00:21:43.425 --> 00:21:46.737
now if we take to music,

00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:49.816
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.144
What does it mean?

00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:58.100
It means that the state of human beings,

00:22:00.562 --> 00:22:03.252
is to be corrected

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.575
and has to be made rhythmic

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.498
and has to be made organized.

00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:11.348
Unless it is done,

00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:13.004
it is of no use.

00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:16.686
What is the difference between you people and others?

00:22:16.887 --> 00:22:19.503
If you also keep fighting,

00:22:19.704 --> 00:22:22.035
then what is the use?

00:22:22.373 --> 00:22:26.992
The most important thing is that in your mind,

00:22:27.193 --> 00:22:31.985
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.172
so that you become peaceful

00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:38.493
and others also become peaceful.

00:22:38.694 --> 00:22:42.185
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:49.440
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

00:22:50.284 --> 00:22:54.717
this beautiful building has been erected.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:02.239
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

00:23:03.188 --> 00:23:08.493
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

00:23:08.694 --> 00:23:11.996
Today world needs only Peace.

00:23:12.346 --> 00:23:15.487
Everything else we have today is worthless.

00:23:15.688 --> 00:23:18.854
We have to see how peaceful we are.

00:23:19.055 --> 00:23:24.465
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

00:23:24.666 --> 00:23:26.969
then on which country will it have?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:33.637
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

00:23:33.838 --> 00:23:36.346
But, I can’t see anything like it.

00:23:36.547 --> 00:23:40.803
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:44.385
Don't know what to say?

00:23:44.907 --> 00:23:47.964
So those who want to learn music,

00:23:48.165 --> 00:23:51.318
must have music in their hearts also.

00:23:52.361 --> 00:23:55.403
Should think from the heart.

00:23:55.604 --> 00:23:59.633
Running after money, running after women,

00:23:59.834 --> 00:24:02.939
and doing all sorts of wrong things

00:24:03.162 --> 00:24:06.911
is unbecoming of a musician.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.621
My eternal blessings

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.422
that this organization should flourish

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:18.524
and people coming here should learn music

00:24:18.725 --> 00:24:22.653
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

00:24:22.854 --> 00:24:27.392
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

00:24:28.285 --> 00:24:32.601
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

00:24:33.229 --> 00:24:36.134
whenever you have complains,

00:24:36.335 --> 00:24:42.902
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

00:24:44.806 --> 00:24:46.732
I am different from others,

00:24:46.933 --> 00:24:50.383
Mother has transformed me into something else.

00:24:50.584 --> 00:24:52.439
If you understand this

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.050
you will recognise your glory.

00:24:56.402 --> 00:24:59.860
But if you cannot achieve this,

00:25:00.061 --> 00:25:02.505
then it is useless.

00:25:02.706 --> 00:25:07.322
Then making 50 such organizations

00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:10.251
also is of no use.

00:25:11.423 --> 00:25:14.984
Fighting for small, small things,

00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:17.743
doesn't become you.

00:25:17.944 --> 00:25:20.878
You are Saints now.

00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:24.652
You have achieved great heights,

00:25:24.853 --> 00:25:27.088
very great heights,

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:30.124
And You do not realize that.

00:25:30.325 --> 00:25:34.242
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

00:25:34.443 --> 00:25:36.549
You think that you are

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.630
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:41.205
No, no.

00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:56.894
My special blessings

00:25:57.489 --> 00:26:01.172
that you all should become musical.

00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:05.428
Today I wanted to bless you all,

00:26:05.629 --> 00:26:10.959
that you become completely musical in temperament,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.555
rhythmic

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:21.985
and entertaining to others

00:26:22.176 --> 00:26:24.778
and not quarrelsome.

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:29.058
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:32.169
is taking to wrong side,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.472
to the wrong progress,

00:26:34.673 --> 00:26:37.901
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

00:26:38.102 --> 00:26:40.521
This will all disappear, I know,

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:43.648
because it is very destructive.

00:26:44.453 --> 00:26:48.290
But, after coming to Sahaja also

00:26:50.664 --> 00:26:53.966
if you have the same destructive idea,

00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:56.065
how can anybody help you?

00:27:39.538 --> 00:27:47.172
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.104
May God bless you.
