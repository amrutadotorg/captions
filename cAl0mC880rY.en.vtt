WEBVTT

18:37.983 --> 18:45.019
Today, we have gathered here to do
Ganesha Puja.

18:46.850 --> 18:51.577
I know very well that Ganesha is the symbol

18:51.795 --> 18:56.771
of purity, of sanctity,

18:57.452 --> 19:07.646
and worshipping the innocence.

19:09.015 --> 19:14.138
When you are worshipping Shri Ganesh,
you have to know

19:14.339 --> 19:19.831
that He is the embodiment of innocence.

19:20.557 --> 19:26.999
I wonder if we understand the meaning
of innocence or not.

19:27.589 --> 19:33.748
Innocence is a quality, which is innate,

19:34.214 --> 19:39.415
which cannot be forced, which cannot
be trained into.

19:39.616 --> 19:47.184
It’s just a quality, innate quality,
within a human being.

19:47.385 --> 19:55.297
When he becomes Shri Ganesha’s disciple,
he becomes an innocent person.

19:55.498 --> 19:59.642
Maybe you say that innocent persons

19:59.843 --> 20:05.179
are attacked by the cunning,
by the aggressive.

20:05.842 --> 20:11.740
But innocence is such a great thing
that it cannot be destroyed.

20:11.941 --> 20:17.805
Is the quality of the Spirit. Innocence is
the quality of the Spirit.

20:18.057 --> 20:26.477
And when this Spirit within you is
awakened, you get the power of innocence,

20:26.678 --> 20:33.743
by which you overcome all that is negative,
all that is wrong,

20:33.944 --> 20:42.542
all that is detrimental to your growth,
spiritual understanding.

20:43.292 --> 20:47.824
So to be innocent is not possible.

20:48.335 --> 20:55.652
You have to be innocent, in the sense
that you are innately innocent.

20:55.853 --> 21:01.768
This happens after Sahaja Yoga,
after Realization.

21:02.666 --> 21:09.005
And your power to fight all these

21:09.206 --> 21:14.560
wrong, negative feelings within you,
and without,

21:14.761 --> 21:24.645
are absolutely supported, protected
by the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

21:29.772 --> 21:35.899
It’s difficult these days to tell somebody
about innocence.

21:36.100 --> 21:43.658
But you know the life of Christ.
He was a innocent - innocence.

21:43.859 --> 21:48.386
He didn’t know what sort of people
He was around.

21:48.587 --> 21:55.268
He thought they were all innocent. And so
He was talking to them in a manner

21:55.916 --> 22:05.786
that nobody who was cunning would
have done that.

22:05.987 --> 22:09.618
Because cunning always understand
the cunning of others.

22:09.819 --> 22:17.195
And He said things which may not have
been understood by people;

22:17.396 --> 22:23.901
but whatever He said had the vibrations
of innocence.

22:24.400 --> 22:30.451
That should have put all these people
in a proper sense,

22:30.652 --> 22:33.710
in a proper relationship with Him.

22:34.694 --> 22:37.949
But somehow, that was not the time
perhaps for them

22:38.150 --> 22:40.397
to be realized souls.

22:41.358 --> 22:48.598
So the innocence of Ganesha was not,
that we should we say, defeated,

22:48.799 --> 22:58.040
but was very much - created an atmosphere
of such sanctity

22:58.241 --> 23:02.590
and beauty that you can see in the life
of Christ.

23:05.245 --> 23:09.501
I’m happy you all have heard about
your marriages.

23:09.702 --> 23:15.684
Why the marriage? What is the need
to have a marriage?

23:15.885 --> 23:20.098
After all, these days people are living
without marriage.

23:20.299 --> 23:24.572
But marriage means the sanctity
of marriage.

23:25.132 --> 23:33.559
Sanctity of your physical, mental
and emotional integration.

23:33.760 --> 23:39.286
If you do not have the sanctity and you
live with a person,

23:39.487 --> 23:46.575
then it is not perfect. The children you
will produce will not be all right.

23:46.776 --> 23:49.337
That’s why the marriage is necessary.

23:49.538 --> 23:55.247
And as you know, Christ went to attend
a wedding.

23:55.448 --> 23:59.016
Why did He pay so much attention
to a wedding?

23:59.217 --> 24:04.567
Because that sanctifies your relationships
with each other.

24:04.768 --> 24:09.772
Anything is all right, but relationship

24:09.973 --> 24:13.540
between husband and wife have
to be sanctified.

24:13.741 --> 24:19.501
Otherwise, the children you produce
could turn out to be anything.

24:19.702 --> 24:28.020
They may be robbers, they may be cheats,
they may be liars,

24:28.221 --> 24:34.458
they may be very, very cruel people,
if there’s no sanctity about the marriage.

24:34.659 --> 24:38.829
That’s why He went to sanctify the marriage
institution.

24:39.030 --> 24:44.649
But is absolutely wrong and nonsense
that He created alcohol.

24:44.850 --> 24:54.653
What He did was to change the water
into the taste of grape juice.

24:54.854 --> 24:58.966
“Alcohol” is called as “grape juice”
in Hebrew language.

24:59.167 --> 25:07.247
You can say it is not called, but “wine”
means alcohol

25:07.448 --> 25:11.973
as well as grape juice. But it cannot be,

25:12.174 --> 25:17.036
because instantly you cannot create
alcohol.

25:17.237 --> 25:21.329
Alcohol takes time, it has to rot
and rot and rot.

25:21.530 --> 25:28.723
Then it becomes an alcohol. But if Christ
has made it

25:28.924 --> 25:36.520
in such a sahaj manner, spontaneously,
how can it be an alcohol that intoxicates?

25:36.721 --> 25:39.954
So, many people, specially in Christian
religion,

25:40.155 --> 25:46.423
believe that Christ sanctified wine,
which is absolutely wrong.

25:46.624 --> 25:50.766
He never sanctified alcohol. He changed

25:50.967 --> 25:59.661
the grape juice into wine tasting.

25:59.862 --> 26:03.423
The other day, I happened to meet person,

26:03.624 --> 26:06.471
as you know him, Romano Battaglia.

26:06.823 --> 26:10.938
And he said: “Mother, You give me
Realization”.

26:11.139 --> 26:14.380
I said: “Alright, get me some water.”

26:14.581 --> 26:19.114
Brought some water, I put my fingers
into it.

26:19.315 --> 26:23.880
And then he tasted and said: “Mother,
it tastes like wine!” I said: “That’s it!

26:24.081 --> 26:29.974
That’s what Christ has done.” So,
there is no sanctity of alcohol.

26:30.175 --> 26:35.029
How can you expect Christ to do
something like that,

26:35.230 --> 26:39.538
by which your awareness absolutely
goes wrong.

26:40.105 --> 26:44.079
Those people who drink, you know,
are not normal people.

26:44.280 --> 26:48.271
Something goes wrong with their brains.
When they drive, they create problems.

26:48.472 --> 26:56.689
When they are talking to somebody,
you can make out that they are not normal.

26:56.890 --> 26:59.130
They try to be very aggressive,

26:59.331 --> 27:04.212
sometimes they can be very passive also.
Mostly they are very aggressive,

27:04.413 --> 27:10.654
and very much behaving in a manner
that doesn’t behove a human being.

27:10.855 --> 27:15.638
So, we must understand that

27:15.839 --> 27:19.958
this wine, so-called, which is being
fermented for days together,

27:20.159 --> 27:25.214
is very wrong and against the spiritual
life.

27:26.366 --> 27:35.564
All those countries where alcohol
is accepted as a very sanctified thing,

27:35.765 --> 27:39.591
are just going to dogs.

27:39.792 --> 27:44.029
It is against Shri Ganesh. It’s against
innocence.

27:44.230 --> 27:49.536
And so, such a person can become
very cunning, very shrewd,

27:49.737 --> 27:54.364
very dominating – all kinds of bad things
can come through him.

27:54.565 --> 28:00.005
And one cannot trust a person who drinks
and becomes a drunkard.

28:00.206 --> 28:05.329
He can get after his wife, his children,
anybody.

28:05.530 --> 28:11.629
And try to destroy their lives, because
he knows he is himself destroyed.

28:12.190 --> 28:17.716
So the one thing one has to understand,
innocence doesn’t allow you

28:17.917 --> 28:22.607
to have anything like that, that goes
against your awareness.

28:22.808 --> 28:28.079
Your human awareness is very important.
That must be respected.

28:28.280 --> 28:33.048
Anything that you take that spoils
your awareness or spoils your health

28:33.249 --> 28:37.822
is all wrong for - specially for sahaj
yogis.

28:38.023 --> 28:42.954
You have to keep your health all right.
How do you keep your health all right?

28:43.155 --> 28:49.687
By avoiding all such things – those which
destroy your health.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.544
So the married life is a sanctified life.

28:53.745 --> 28:58.177
Is a life which is been blessed.

28:58.378 --> 29:03.607
Now we have peace, but I would say
in Sahaja Yoga, they are all blessed by Me.

29:03.808 --> 29:10.044
So one should understand that this is
a very big thing that you have got.

29:10.245 --> 29:14.880
But there are many I have known, who come
round saying: “Mother, we want a divorce.

29:15.081 --> 29:18.892
We are trying to make up a good marriage…”

29:19.093 --> 29:22.101
All kinds of stories they tell Me.

29:22.483 --> 29:25.775
If you know it’s a sanctified marriage –

29:26.002 --> 29:36.349
is a marriage which is been done under
all the ceremonies of Sahaja Yoga –

29:36.550 --> 29:43.525
it cannot be a bad marriage. But if you
are bad, nobody can help you.

29:43.726 --> 29:49.181
If you have funny ideas about marriages,
you should try to correct it.

29:49.382 --> 29:52.825
If you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga,
then please see

29:53.026 --> 29:57.982
that you respect the sanctity of married
life.

29:58.183 --> 30:01.454
I know, sometimes women can be bad,

30:01.655 --> 30:04.724
men can be bad, there can be problems.

30:04.925 --> 30:09.536
But a person who is wise will try
to endure all that.

30:09.737 --> 30:17.540
Because she wants or he wants to respect
the sanctity of marriage.

30:20.011 --> 30:25.267
This one is a very contradictory thing
then, which comes to,

30:25.468 --> 30:29.175
that Christ was born without the marriage.

30:29.376 --> 30:33.508
And Ganesha was also born without
the marriage.

30:34.019 --> 30:37.665
They Themselves are sanctity.

30:37.866 --> 30:41.029
They don’t need any sanctity from outside.

30:41.230 --> 30:44.728
They are innocence, and for innocent
people,

30:44.929 --> 30:52.638
They don’t need any kind of a ritual
or a kind of a ceremony.

30:52.839 --> 30:58.771
That’s how They have been born,
absolutely pure, of innocence.

30:58.972 --> 31:03.927
But that doesn’t mean that we should
take Their example into ourselves.

31:04.128 --> 31:08.337
They were divine personalities, and They
were to be born like that.

31:08.538 --> 31:14.440
While we have to be sanctified and leading
a sanctified life.

31:14.656 --> 31:20.019
This is a difference between an incarnation
and a human being.

31:20.504 --> 31:27.817
Is easy to criticise incarnations.
Very simple to criticise Them.

31:28.018 --> 31:31.817
All incarnations have been criticised
by human beings,

31:32.018 --> 31:34.989
because human beings cannot understand
Them.

31:35.190 --> 31:41.079
But try to be really very pure and
innocent,

31:41.280 --> 31:46.251
and then you will understand that why
Their lives were on a different line,

31:46.452 --> 31:48.934
different style.

31:52.733 --> 31:58.156
Now, if you say: “We can develop
innocence, Mother”, you cannot.

31:58.787 --> 32:03.360
Which is the way to become innocent?
In Sahaja Yoga,

32:03.561 --> 32:10.290
we have a proper method how we can
become innocent.

32:10.491 --> 32:17.321
It happens through our thoughtless
awareness.

32:17.522 --> 32:21.466
If you are in the state of thoughtless
awareness,

32:21.677 --> 32:24.899
then what happens, you do not react.

32:25.100 --> 32:30.300
You do not get involved into wrong things.

32:30.745 --> 32:36.645
You do not get involved into any
discussions, arguments. But you just watch.

32:36.846 --> 32:39.852
And the innocence within you rises
beautifully,

32:40.053 --> 32:44.871
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.645
So, whatever may be the circumstances,

32:47.846 --> 32:52.493
when you are in thoughtless awareness,
you do not react.

32:52.694 --> 32:59.263
That is the sign of innocence. And people
who do not react keep young.

32:59.464 --> 33:02.595
They will never show their age,
they keep young.

33:02.796 --> 33:12.380
Because to react is not a very good thing,

33:12.581 --> 33:17.208
which makes you get involved into
another person.

33:17.409 --> 33:22.934
But if you don’t react, if you are just
watching, and you are a witness,

33:23.135 --> 33:27.208
then you don’t get involved into anything.
You are away from everything.

33:27.409 --> 33:34.128
And that’s how your innocence grows
and you get very confident.

33:34.893 --> 33:41.245
I’ve read a story about a Chinese king,
who went

33:42.228 --> 33:51.040
to a saint, and asked Him that he wants
some boon from Him. He said, “What?”

33:51.241 --> 33:57.380
He said: “I want my son to be developed
into a person

33:57.581 --> 34:00.431
who can face all kinds of people.

34:00.632 --> 34:04.380
Whatever people may do, he should
be able to face them”.

34:04.581 --> 34:08.100
He said: “Alright, you leave your son
with me”.

34:08.745 --> 34:13.118
So, when the arguments started,
when the fighting started,

34:13.319 --> 34:15.130
his son was just standing straight,

34:15.331 --> 34:18.188
watching everything in thoughtless
awareness.

34:18.389 --> 34:25.813
So, everybody from the arena went back,
they all went away.

34:26.014 --> 34:33.664
And they couldn’t stand the innocence
of this boy, who was very young.

34:33.865 --> 34:37.707
And the king was surprised how his son
could face

34:37.908 --> 34:41.852
all of them, all their arguments,
all their aggression

34:42.053 --> 34:46.266
and all kinds of horrible things
they said to him.

34:46.467 --> 34:52.344
If anybody says anything to you, you should
just be innocent.

34:52.545 --> 34:56.356
At that time, your power of innocence
will show

34:56.557 --> 35:01.160
that this person, who is trying
to dominate you,

35:01.361 --> 35:05.695
to trouble you, is very much in the wrong.

35:05.896 --> 35:11.289
And the person himself might realise that:
“I’m doing all these things

35:11.490 --> 35:16.595
and this fellow, the one on whom I’m trying
to dominate,

35:16.796 --> 35:19.113
is not taking any note of it.”

35:19.314 --> 35:23.693
So he feels very weak.

35:23.894 --> 35:27.154
He thinks he has no power to dominate
a person.

35:27.355 --> 35:30.525
So this is we have now as sahaj yogis:

35:30.726 --> 35:33.388
we can get into thoughtless awareness.

35:33.589 --> 35:37.595
Try to reduce your reactions, reaction
to anything.

35:37.796 --> 35:42.908
People have such funny ideas about
themselves that they react.

35:43.109 --> 35:47.502
Now for example, somebody showed me
those carpets,

35:47.703 --> 35:51.576
I’ve started watching, I was very happy.
And they told me

35:51.777 --> 35:56.849
all the sahaja yoginis have made these
with their hands, so beautifully.

35:57.050 --> 36:01.916
I mean, it was really so joyful to know
that they have done it.

36:02.117 --> 36:08.810
But if I was a very normal person, I would
have said: “Oh, My God,

36:09.011 --> 36:12.740
what a colour! What a thing!” and all
that ... like that.

36:12.941 --> 36:16.673
So whatever they have done, I can’t even
enjoy that.

36:16.874 --> 36:22.658
One thing is the enjoyment is lost.
For a child, enjoyment is complete.

36:22.859 --> 36:28.384
Whatever he sees, he makes a joy,
joyful thing out of it.

36:28.585 --> 36:32.263
You look at children - I’ve seen children,

36:32.464 --> 36:35.248
they find anything, they make a toy
out of it.

36:35.449 --> 36:41.779
The other day, we had gone to Genoa and
I saw there were big blockets kept there.

36:41.980 --> 36:44.877
Some children came from somewhere.
They just climbed on that

36:45.078 --> 36:48.084
and made horses out of them. And were
enjoying them.

36:48.285 --> 36:50.728
You see, they find anything, any space,

36:50.929 --> 36:56.103
they make a joyful thing for them to,
a play for them.

36:56.304 --> 37:04.537
For them, life is also a play.
Just a thing of enjoyment.

37:04.738 --> 37:07.392
And they make you also enjoy everything.

37:07.593 --> 37:12.666
If you are not in a good mood, they’ll
come and behave in such a manner

37:12.867 --> 37:22.525
that you’ll have to come round and become
a very simple, natural person.

37:22.726 --> 37:25.732
So to see, a simple natural person,
we always say:

37:25.933 --> 37:30.619
“See, they are like children”. Means they
do not understand the cunning.

37:30.820 --> 37:35.275
They do not understand the stupidity
of the people,

37:35.444 --> 37:38.537
and they live in their own world
of innocence.

37:38.738 --> 37:45.416
In the same way, all the Sahaja Yogis
have to develop that aura around them.

37:45.617 --> 37:50.705
Let people see you, how innocent you are,
how sweet you are!

37:50.906 --> 37:56.033
No arguments, no quarrelling, no fighting
is needed.

37:56.234 --> 38:02.541
It is just the inner satisfaction
of thoughtless awareness.

38:02.742 --> 38:05.353
Many people say: “Mother, we cannot
become thoughtless!”

38:05.554 --> 38:07.927
Why? Why can’t you become thoughtless?

38:08.128 --> 38:12.841
Because all the time, whatever you see,
you want to react.

38:13.042 --> 38:16.369
If you gradually start stopping reaction -

38:16.570 --> 38:19.670
introspect yourself, see for yourself.

38:19.871 --> 38:29.261
If you are all the time trying to react,
tell your mind to behave itself.

38:30.183 --> 38:34.427
If there’s any reaction, you just don’t say
anything. Keep quiet.

38:34.628 --> 38:38.576
Gradually, you’ll be amazed and surprised

38:38.777 --> 38:46.224
how you become thoughtlessly aware,
how beautiful you become.

38:46.425 --> 38:50.607
And everybody who sees you will know that

38:50.808 --> 38:54.955
you are something different – you are not
like the normal person.

38:55.156 --> 38:59.260
But the normal reaction of human beings is
this, that, if there’s a quarrel going on,

38:59.461 --> 39:05.799
say, on the street, everybody will join in
the quarrel. They like to fight.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.987
They want to be part and parcel of that
quarrel or fight or whatever it is.

39:13.188 --> 39:15.420
They don’t want to get out of it.

39:15.621 --> 39:20.740
At that time, if you just have your
innocence, that will act.

39:20.941 --> 39:24.548
I told you, innocence is the Spirit,
and Spirit is the innocence,

39:24.749 --> 39:30.017
which cannot be destroyed by anything.
The fact is that it cannot be destroyed

39:30.218 --> 39:36.840
by anything, and it can be re-established
through Sahaja Yoga.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.879
You might have been a very aggressive
person,

39:40.080 --> 39:42.623
you might have been a very unhappy person,

39:42.824 --> 39:47.670
you might have been a person who is
all the time disturbing others – maybe.

39:47.871 --> 39:52.845
But after Sahaja Yoga, you can make
your personality so sweet and beautiful,

39:53.046 --> 39:57.885
that not only you can enjoy, but others
can also enjoy.

39:59.995 --> 40:08.120
This innocence is something which is
absolute, honest intelligence.

40:09.109 --> 40:18.865
It is not that it works for the purpose,
some purpose.

40:19.066 --> 40:24.076
But it is purposeless. It’s absolutely
purposeless.

40:24.277 --> 40:32.587
And thus it achieves that height of joy
because there is no purpose in anything

40:32.788 --> 40:37.524
It sees the futility of all kinds
of endeavours that we have,

40:37.725 --> 40:42.599
and it just enjoys: “Why people are running
up and down, why are they fighting?”

40:42.802 --> 40:47.521
Just stands up and sees, that: “Why
should they do it?” – like that.

40:47.722 --> 40:49.638
Some may think they are all right,

40:49.839 --> 40:53.119
there’s nothing wrong with them,
but it’s not so.

40:53.320 --> 40:57.751
Innocence is something, I told you,
is an innate quality,

40:57.952 --> 41:03.663
and you should not deceive yourself
by thinking you are innocent.

41:03.898 --> 41:08.536
On the contrary, you just put some
introspection upon yourself,

41:08.737 --> 41:12.206
and see for yourself what have you been
doing so far,

41:12.407 --> 41:17.701
as far as others are concerned?
What is your attitude?

41:17.902 --> 41:21.548
I have already talked to you about
emotional intelligence.

41:21.749 --> 41:26.357
Emotional intelligence is the expression
of innocence.

41:26.558 --> 41:31.076
It is the expression of Shri Ganesha
within you.

41:31.277 --> 41:36.802
Children who are gifted with this will
always try to please you.

41:37.003 --> 41:40.040
They know what you want, what you need.

41:40.241 --> 41:43.466
They’ll give you all the joy that you want,

41:43.667 --> 41:47.212
they’ll do all the things that you like,
just to please you.

41:47.413 --> 41:52.244
They don’t have their own wants. They don’t
want to have their own demands.

41:52.445 --> 41:56.615
They never say: “I want this”,
“You do for me” – never!

41:56.816 --> 42:01.185
They just want to see what you want,
what do you want to have.

42:01.386 --> 42:07.497
And they put all the effort to supply you
with that, whatever you want.

42:07.698 --> 42:10.744
It’s very interesting how the children
behave

42:10.945 --> 42:19.091
towards others, elders. Just like, I would
say, a great understanding, we should say,

42:19.292 --> 42:23.423
like a very elderly personality.

42:23.624 --> 42:27.705
So, in innocence, you become extremely
grown up, matured.

42:27.906 --> 42:30.974
Very matured. With that maturity you know

42:31.175 --> 42:35.865
what this person needs, and what
the other person should not have.

42:36.066 --> 42:38.955
And the way they establish is very
interesting.

42:39.156 --> 42:43.177
Children are the most interesting things,
I think, in the world.

42:43.378 --> 42:49.279
For me, roses are very beautiful, but
children are the most interesting things.

42:49.480 --> 42:55.759
And they teach you so many things that
you are surprised at their innocence.

42:55.960 --> 43:00.697
So many jokes are there about the children
– how they behave, how they talk.

43:00.898 --> 43:05.658
And they are so innocent that they will
tell everything to everyone.

43:05.859 --> 43:12.134
They have no way of hiding anything,
it’s very difficult.

43:12.335 --> 43:19.728
I know one joke: when a gentleman
came to the house for dinner.

43:19.929 --> 43:23.452
So the child was looking at him
very intensely.

43:23.653 --> 43:27.381
And then he says: “Mother, he doesn’t eat

43:27.582 --> 43:31.487
like a horse, as you told me!”.
So everybody was shocked!

43:31.688 --> 43:33.272
“You see, he doesn’t eat like a horse!”.

43:33.473 --> 43:35.753
Mother must have told him: “He eats
like a horse”.

43:35.954 --> 43:38.647
So he looked at him: “He doesn’t
eat like a horse!”. You see,

43:38.848 --> 43:42.338
they are so innocent sometimes,
they say things,

43:42.539 --> 43:45.327
by which you can get exposed completely.

43:45.528 --> 43:51.030
There are so many jokes about it. And if
you write some books,

43:51.231 --> 43:55.940
writing the jokes of children, I tell you,
people will just enjoy it.

43:56.141 --> 44:01.588
Because so innocently they say things,
which are nothing but the truth.

44:01.789 --> 44:05.893
And they cannot tell lies. They are
so truthful,

44:06.094 --> 44:10.713
that’s the quality of innocence.
They never tell lies.

44:10.914 --> 44:13.131
“You did this?” “Yes, I did.”

44:13.332 --> 44:17.690
“You didn’t do this?” “No, I didn’t do.”
They never tell lies.

44:17.891 --> 44:26.976
It is we, the grown-ups teach them to how
to tell lies, how to be cheating.

44:28.457 --> 44:31.690
Then we teach also our children another
bad thing,

44:31.891 --> 44:35.022
that is, “You must possess everything.”

44:35.223 --> 44:39.514
Especially in the West, is a thing they do.

44:39.715 --> 44:45.238
They tell the child that: “This is yours,
you should not give it to anyone,

44:45.439 --> 44:47.608
this is your own.”

44:47.809 --> 44:52.749
On the contrary, you should tell them:
“You can do what you like.”

44:52.950 --> 44:54.433
Leave it to their innocence.

44:54.634 --> 44:58.366
You’ll be amazed, they’ll give up
everything that they have.

44:58.567 --> 45:02.143
In such a beautiful manner they’ll behave,
that you’ll be amazed

45:02.344 --> 45:09.678
how they try to please everyone, and try
to do something to entertain you.

45:09.879 --> 45:14.385
All their capacity of this is so great
that sometimes

45:14.586 --> 45:19.010
one wonders how these little things
have developed these capacities.

45:19.211 --> 45:23.522
It is the blessings of Shri Ganesha.
Is His blessings

45:23.723 --> 45:30.870
that children are so very sweet and
so much entertaining, and so beautiful.

45:31.071 --> 45:34.491
Try to become like them. We have to be
like them.

45:34.692 --> 45:38.456
You might have read many books, you might
have got lots of degrees,

45:38.657 --> 45:43.323
you might be something great, but you are
not a childlike.

45:43.524 --> 45:51.670
You have to be a childlike person.
Otherwise, no one likes your company.

45:51.871 --> 45:55.690
We call them bores. But actually boring
comes with the people

45:55.891 --> 46:01.064
who have no innocence in their heart.
They are trying to tell you:

46:01.883 --> 46:06.534
“You must do this. If you want to be
successful, you do that.”

46:06.735 --> 46:09.600
All these lectures are useless
for children.

46:09.801 --> 46:14.112
In the same way, it should be within
your own understanding

46:14.313 --> 46:17.233
that it’s all nonsense they are talking.

46:17.434 --> 46:21.362
As the children don’t care for what
you suggest to them –

46:21.563 --> 46:25.940
to be nasty, to be horrid – in the same
way, if you are innocent

46:26.141 --> 46:30.366
you will not accept it. You may listen
to anything,

46:30.567 --> 46:34.378
let them tell you anything they want to,
doesn’t matter.

46:34.579 --> 46:39.094
You’ll never do that, because you cannot,
because you are innocent.

46:39.329 --> 46:43.194
And the innocence will guard you, it will
give you proper guidance

46:43.395 --> 46:46.378
what is to be done, what is not to be
done.

46:46.579 --> 46:52.604
Now try to introspect and see for yourself:
“Are you innocent or not?”

46:52.805 --> 46:58.204
People think that somebody is trying
to overpower you,

46:58.688 --> 47:05.768
is trying to harm you, is trying to put
you down.

47:05.969 --> 47:08.596
Nobody can put down innocence.

47:08.797 --> 47:14.413
Innocence is a quality that survives
all kinds of nonsense.

47:14.614 --> 47:22.535
And not only that, but age, your health,
your mind,

47:23.368 --> 47:29.057
your thinking, and your emotions,

47:29.258 --> 47:35.809
are extremely innocent and you enjoy
yourself.

47:37.231 --> 47:42.177
Nowadays, there’s a big wave

47:44.784 --> 47:48.210
of shamelessness. Sometimes they have.

47:49.770 --> 47:52.674
The people I’ve seen, they have no Lajja.

47:52.875 --> 47:55.444
I don’t know, some men want to attract
women

47:55.645 --> 47:59.827
and some women want to attract men.
Children never do like that.

48:00.028 --> 48:04.096
They don’t know what is this ‘to attract
men’ or ‘to attract women’,

48:04.297 --> 48:10.538
or ‘attract’ anyone. They’ll try to please
the dog, they’ll try to please a horse,

48:10.739 --> 48:17.233
but they never I’ve seen going all out
to attract someone.

48:17.434 --> 48:23.325
The reason is this, that their self-esteem
is complete.

48:24.164 --> 48:26.983
They know about themselves fully.

48:27.184 --> 48:29.124
So why should they do all this nonsense

48:29.325 --> 48:35.014
of running after women, running after men
and creating problems for themselves?

48:35.215 --> 48:39.503
Their self-esteem is complete. Innocence
is like that.

48:39.704 --> 48:43.456
It gives you a complete self-esteem.

48:43.657 --> 48:48.081
You don’t bow to anyone, nor you make
anybody else to bow.

48:48.282 --> 48:52.956
This is the beauty of innocence, which
works out so well within you.

48:53.157 --> 48:58.131
That’s why I always say that: “Worship
Shri Ganesha!”

48:58.332 --> 49:06.128
I know of somebody who was very highly
placed.

49:06.329 --> 49:12.948
And suddenly I was surprised how
he was paralysed.

49:13.149 --> 49:19.079
What happened? He was a very good man,
he should not have been paralysed.

49:19.477 --> 49:29.222
Then I found out that he had very bad
intentions about women,

49:29.809 --> 49:33.440
and that’s how he got this problem.

49:33.641 --> 49:38.264
So I told him: “You’d better worship
Ganesha. You worship Shri Ganesha”.

49:38.465 --> 49:42.370
Worshipping the Shri Ganesha improves
your Mooladhara,

49:42.606 --> 49:50.577
improves your sense of shame, improves
of your own dignity, self-esteem.

49:50.778 --> 49:56.565
You dress up in a way that shows that
you respect your body.

49:56.766 --> 50:01.756
You talk in such a way that shows that
you respect your tongue,

50:01.957 --> 50:07.128
your language. You cannot have a foul
mouth if you are an innocent person.

50:07.329 --> 50:14.659
Cannot have a mind that can abuse
or can say horrible words.

50:14.860 --> 50:20.424
I have seen, in America, they talk in such
a funny manner that you are shocked.

50:20.625 --> 50:25.893
There’s no need to use these dirty words
to express yourself.

50:26.094 --> 50:31.370
With that, your tongue gets spoiled.
So innocence is gone from your tongue.

50:31.571 --> 50:33.702
If you have lost innocence from
your tongue,

50:33.903 --> 50:38.034
whatever you say will never come true –
will never come true.

50:38.235 --> 50:41.249
But if you are innocent, and your tongue
is innocent

50:41.450 --> 50:44.831
and respects… So the basic, as you
can see,

50:45.032 --> 50:47.725
is respect your innocence in every manner.

50:47.926 --> 50:53.960
Like, when you have to get angry with
somebody or say something,

50:54.161 --> 50:56.081
just keep quiet is the best way.

50:56.282 --> 51:02.362
Or else you must respect your tongue,
respect your eyes.

51:02.598 --> 51:07.596
Some people have a very bad habit of roving
their eyes all over, looking at women;

51:07.797 --> 51:12.620
or some women are like that. You don’t
respect your eyes,

51:12.821 --> 51:18.346
then they develop problems of the eyes.
Not only that, but mind also.

51:18.547 --> 51:25.573
Mind gets so much ruined by this kind
of behaviour that it has no sense.

51:25.774 --> 51:30.284
It cannot enjoy anything. Such a person
cannot enjoy anything.

51:30.485 --> 51:37.875
If you are a person who respects your eyes,
your nose, your ears –

51:38.840 --> 51:44.467
I tell you, you’ll be amazed. Everything is
so enjoyable.

51:44.668 --> 51:47.909
In this world there are so many things
to be enjoyed.

51:48.110 --> 51:50.881
But people can’t hear anything that is
good.

51:51.082 --> 51:54.120
There are birds who are chirping –
they can’t hear.

51:54.321 --> 51:56.999
There are trees, which are growing,
they can’t see.

51:57.200 --> 52:00.772
There are flowers, which have fragrance –
they cannot smell.

52:00.973 --> 52:05.292
Because they are so much low
in their self-esteem,

52:05.493 --> 52:08.952
because they are very low-level people,
I should say,

52:09.153 --> 52:12.190
who cannot enjoy everything around.

52:12.391 --> 52:15.057
And they should be a source of enjoyment.

52:15.258 --> 52:19.100
You see children, how they are source
of enjoyment!

52:19.301 --> 52:23.190
Anybody who comes on the stage and
runs about, I mean, how we enjoy.

52:23.391 --> 52:26.327
Why? Why do we enjoy a child running
about?

52:26.528 --> 52:31.155
We don’t say he’s gone amuck, or he’s
drunk, but we enjoy the child. Why?

52:31.356 --> 52:36.221
What is the sweetness of that child that
makes us so happy?

52:36.422 --> 52:41.139
Because that’s innocence. His power
is innocence.

52:41.340 --> 52:46.295
With that power, he is just looking
so sweet, so beautiful

52:46.496 --> 52:49.831
that it gives us the real joy within us.

52:50.032 --> 52:55.010
So the second thing is that innocence
is joy-giving.

52:55.211 --> 53:00.541
Innocence gives joy to people. Anything
said innocently,

53:00.742 --> 53:06.073
anything done innocently is very,
very joy-giving.

53:06.274 --> 53:13.952
And, in that, you see the person
so transparent, so beautiful,

53:14.153 --> 53:23.627
that you enjoy that transparency and
that sanctified innocence.

53:23.828 --> 53:26.952
That’s why Ganesha is worshipped first.

53:27.153 --> 53:34.143
Because Ganesha was the first Deity
that was created by Adi Shakti.

53:34.344 --> 53:40.331
Because, if She has to create something,

53:40.532 --> 53:43.053
She must know that there has to be
power of innocence.

53:43.254 --> 53:47.440
Otherwise people will go wrong, they’ll
do all kinds of wrong things.

53:47.641 --> 53:51.971
So first She created Ganesha, whose
innocence –

53:52.172 --> 53:57.706
you can call the vibrations – are so strong
that it controls.

53:57.907 --> 54:01.998
Of course, there are people who have
abandoned completely

54:02.199 --> 54:06.600
their innocence and they think no end
of themselves. Just forget about them!

54:06.801 --> 54:13.397
But normally, normally, you are always
guided by your innocence,

54:13.598 --> 54:18.850
whether you are aware of it or not,
and that is such a sweet thing.

54:19.051 --> 54:22.403
Such a sweet thing that it makes

54:22.604 --> 54:26.229
people rise in their nobleness,
in their greatness.

54:26.430 --> 54:31.182
And that is what we have to develop in us,
the sahaj yogis.

54:31.383 --> 54:35.108
When sahaj yogis go anywhere, try to do
anything,

54:35.309 --> 54:37.616
meet anybody, any social work

54:37.817 --> 54:43.479
anything, people should feel that joy that
you have within yourself.

54:43.680 --> 54:47.090
It’s for that joy only

54:48.449 --> 54:52.225
the Adi Shakti created Shri Ganesha.

54:52.426 --> 54:57.600
Because that joy within, of innocent joy,
which doesn’t harm anybody,

54:57.801 --> 55:00.799
which doesn’t expect anything, which
doesn’t demand anything,

55:01.000 --> 55:06.631
which doesn’t want anything, but just
emitting joy all over -

55:06.832 --> 55:09.928
that sort of a personality you should have.

55:10.129 --> 55:13.221
There’s nothing wrong in wearing good
dresses,

55:13.422 --> 55:16.010
nothing wrong in eating good food,

55:16.211 --> 55:20.713
nothing wrong in having conversations
with people.

55:20.914 --> 55:25.456
But in all that, it is the respect
of the innocence,

55:25.680 --> 55:28.491
the expression of innocence should be
there.

55:28.692 --> 55:33.112
With this innocence we can solve
the problems –

55:33.313 --> 55:35.842
all the problems of the world can be
solved.

55:36.043 --> 55:39.346
That’s why Shri Ganesha is so important.

55:39.547 --> 55:45.620
If you do not have proper understanding
of Shri Ganesha,

55:45.821 --> 55:52.307
and if your Shri Ganesha is in a jeopardy,
I don’t know what can happen to you.

55:52.508 --> 55:57.807
These days, see, so many horrible diseases
are coming,

55:58.008 --> 56:02.901
because they are not sanctified. Their
relationships are not sanctified.

56:03.102 --> 56:07.413
Every relationship has to be sanctified
with your innocence.

56:07.614 --> 56:12.155
Like, you have a sister, you have a mother,
you have a brother,

56:12.356 --> 56:16.327
you have a father, you have all these
relationships.

56:16.528 --> 56:21.182
And these all relationships they are
so good, so beautiful and sanctified,

56:21.383 --> 56:25.940
because there is the relationship
of innocence.

56:26.141 --> 56:31.416
You love your father out of innocence, and
you love your daughter out of innocence,

56:31.617 --> 56:36.010
you love your mother out of innocence.
Why should you love,

56:36.211 --> 56:39.834
for some sort of a gain? Then it’s
cunning.

56:40.035 --> 56:46.147
For some sort of an overpowering?
Then it’s cunning.

56:46.348 --> 56:50.748
It’s just for love’s, love’s sake. That’s
possible if you are innocent.

56:50.949 --> 56:54.721
So now I’m happy: tomorrow you are
all going to get married.

56:54.922 --> 56:57.514
And those people who are getting married
should understand

56:57.715 --> 57:01.268
that it’s a sanctified marriage.
It’s very important.

57:01.469 --> 57:08.100
It’s not like any other marriage. It’s the
marriage taking place in my presence.

57:08.301 --> 57:13.467
So be careful! Now, if you do not want
to marry, all right, finish it.

57:13.668 --> 57:16.573
You have been given a chance to know
the person, to understand it.

57:16.774 --> 57:20.748
But afterwards, if you try to be funny,
it’s going to be very difficult

57:20.949 --> 57:26.233
for you and for me. I may give up having
marriages.

57:26.434 --> 57:32.309
So I don’t like people to talk of divorce
from the very first day.

57:33.102 --> 57:36.491
But if there is really a problem,

57:36.692 --> 57:41.963
it’s all right, in Sahaja Yoga, we have
allowed divorce.

57:42.164 --> 57:45.100
Not, say, the Catholic Church, they don’t
allow divorce.

57:45.301 --> 57:48.949
So men have all kinds of relationships
and women have all kinds of relationships.

57:49.150 --> 57:54.155
That’s not there. Instead of doing this
kind of a nonsense, you can have a divorce.

57:54.356 --> 57:59.773
But it should be very innocent happening.

57:59.974 --> 58:04.292
That if you are divorcing a person because
your innocence is challenged,

58:04.493 --> 58:08.901
it’s all right. There, I agree with you
that you should have.

58:09.102 --> 58:11.295
So preserve your innocence.

58:11.496 --> 58:17.069
In these modern times, it’s very important
to preserve your innocence,

58:17.270 --> 58:24.916
that Shri Ganesh should be awakened
within you, and also in other people.

58:25.117 --> 58:28.859
That is going to save this world.
Nothing else,

58:29.060 --> 58:33.756
but the innocence that you have,
is going to save the world.

58:33.957 --> 58:39.663
Whatever you may know, whatever you
may say, whatever you may write,

58:39.864 --> 58:45.194
please see that you are not hurting
the innocence within you.

58:45.395 --> 58:51.569
It’s not necessary to lead a life
of morality, this, that.

58:51.770 --> 58:54.013
What is needed is your innocence.

58:54.214 --> 58:59.708
Innocence itself gives you moral strength,
moral understanding.

58:59.909 --> 59:04.856
You don’t have to read books for that,
you don’t have to go to any guru for that.

59:05.057 --> 59:10.966
Innocence will guide you and tell you
that: “This is what is sahaj,

59:11.167 --> 59:15.544
this is what you have to have.” You all
have got Realization,

59:15.745 --> 59:18.868
is a very big thing, that has happened
to so many people.

59:19.069 --> 59:24.837
And I always want you to worship
Shri Ganesh within you.

59:25.038 --> 59:29.227
Shri Ganesh is your innocence, it is
the Spirit within you.

59:29.428 --> 59:34.263
When you want to know your Spirit,
it is Shri Ganesha you become one,

59:34.464 --> 59:37.759
one with Shri Ganesh. It is within you,

59:37.960 --> 59:41.192
and is absolutely possible for all of you

59:41.393 --> 59:48.671
to be completely enlightened by the power
of Shri Ganesha.

59:49.546 --> 59:53.618
I’m very happy that you have accepted
all the marriages,

59:53.819 --> 59:55.853
and you have decided to marry.

59:56.015 --> 59:59.798
But, even now, if you say no, it’s better
to finish it off.

59:59.999 --> 01:00:03.349
But don’t try any tricks, and don’t try
to be funny,

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:07.958
because that is not going to help you
in any way to enjoy your marriage.

01:00:08.159 --> 01:00:13.372
From the very first day, try to understand
that you have to be very kind.

01:00:13.573 --> 01:00:17.345
Kind to your partner, very respectful,

01:00:17.546 --> 01:00:22.016
very caring, very loving. That’s a very
important thing,

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:25.716
which people don’t understand. And do not
take for granted:

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:29.016
“It’s alright because it’s a sahaj
marriage”, people take it for granted.

01:00:29.217 --> 01:00:32.700
No, never take it for granted. If you want
to have real joy,

01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:37.356
then have innocent love between yourself
and enjoy yourself.

01:00:37.557 --> 01:00:40.179
May God bless you. Thank you.
