1
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:18,360
Now, the ascent of the Kundalini when it takes
place, the seat of the Spirit is on top of your

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:27,137
head and that’s why you get your enlightenment
when the Kundalini touches the seat of the Spirit.

3
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:31,964
It’s the seat or called as pita in
Sanskrit language, is called pith.

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,554
As a result of this happening, the first thing you
feel is the cool breeze coming out of your head.

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,512
You also start feeling the
cool breeze all around you

6
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:48,214
because this is the All-pervading
Power of God which is formless.

7
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,151
When you start feeling that
energy for the first time,

8
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:56,590
then you have to know what it is,
how to use it, how to work it out.

9
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:03,660
The- another meaning of the word “yoga”, also
means “yukti”, means the deepness, deepness,

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:11,100
how to you use the All-pervading Power
of God, how to decode, how to manifest.

11
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:18,190
Now the nature of the Spirit is that,
when it comes into your attention,

12
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,338
first of all, your brain gets
enlightened with the truth.

13
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,040
That is, you go to a person and
he says he is a very great guru,

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,960
you don’t know whether he is a real
or not, you cannot make it out.

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,360
But because you have got these cool vibrations,
you can feel the cool vibrations from a Sat Guru

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,184
and from a bad one you might
even get some blisters.
