1
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:54,097
It is such a great pleasure to see you all
assembled here,

2
00:00:54,298 --> 00:01:05,165
and which is such a far-fetched place, away
from the madding crowd.

3
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:13,807
It's such a beautiful place, and which has
vibrations.

4
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:19,684
They can't hear you.

5
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:26,825
Now can you hear Me? All right.

6
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:32,277
It's all right now.

7
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:39,024
I selected this place suddenly

8
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:45,872
from a very thick newspaper, American
newspaper.

9
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,974
The vibrations were just shooting out

10
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:53,702
and I said, "What is this, coming from
where?"

11
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:57,140
And there was a little advertisement,

12
00:01:57,341 --> 00:02:02,692
and I said, "This is the place where we
have to go."

13
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:10,441
This place has so many vibrations, even
in the advertisement."

14
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:17,237
So you can imagine how the guidance comes.

15
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:25,085
It comes from vibrations, and that's how
I was here

16
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:32,831
and this place was selected by the divine
Force,

17
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:36,958
and it happened only in one day.

18
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:41,844
Such a miraculous thing to happen in one
day!

19
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:49,110
It was taking so much time for them even
to get this,

20
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:54,248
and suddenly I told them, "Better get it."

21
00:02:55,023 --> 00:03:04,730
It all worked out, and we are now here
in the most beautiful atmosphere.

22
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:14,803
Of course, you know that Red Indians were
driven out

23
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:23,592
and they came here to hide themselves. They
were hiding themselves in this place

24
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:33,205
so that they should not be crushed and
destroyed forever.

25
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:41,037
That era is over now, that era
of domination,

26
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:47,320
of entering into somebody else's land and
occupying it,

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,675
and considering it to be a great revelry,

28
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:58,420
all that is over now, the human
understanding has gone much beyond;

29
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,481
and they understand that this is sinful,
this is wrong,

30
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:09,046
whatever we have done was wrong.

31
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:12,406
But those people are no more.

32
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:18,092
And the children and the grandchildren
of those children

33
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:23,440
of these people who were the children
of God, they used to think,

34
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:27,089
do not like all that;

35
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:34,198
because you have no right

36
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:42,384
to take somebody's land like that and
occupy it as your own.

37
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:46,658
Of course, the land doesn't belong
to anyone,

38
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:53,306
but still wherever you are born, that's
your land,

39
00:04:53,506 --> 00:05:02,455
and that land has to be kept with those
who are born here, who own it.

40
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:09,255
But this kind of aggression has been going
on for ages now.

41
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:14,036
Now the time has come to finish this,

42
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:19,186
once for all give up this kind
of adventure,

43
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:27,709
is to enter into somebody's land or
somebody's house and occupy it.

44
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,480
But there's another kind of aggression
I see now,

45
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:37,030
is that they enter into the minds
of the people now

46
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:46,736
through their talk, through their all kinds
of aggressive attitude,

47
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:52,107
and the mind, mind itself becomes a slave.

48
00:05:52,307 --> 00:06:00,569
The present times are like that, I think,
where people have no freedom

49
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:08,486
to think what is right, what is wrong, and
also to take to right things.

50
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:14,958
They have to accept whatever is happening
around,

51
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:22,104
whatever is immoral, whatever is
destructive.

52
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:28,824
One has to accept because still, I think,

53
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:33,025
we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja
yogis

54
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:42,961
who can oppose all these adventures
of modern times.

55
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:47,125
We have another kind where we find

56
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:55,527
these false gurus who aggress - specially
America.

57
00:06:56,186 --> 00:07:02,713
America is really cursed that way because
it had money,

58
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:08,092
so all the crooks of the world came here -
just imagine.

59
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:11,750
To have money itself is not a blessing.

60
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,570
They all came here and looted rich people

61
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:22,342
and have made so much money for themself.

62
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:28,720
This kind of exploitation

63
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:34,677
is very much dangerous, much more,

64
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:40,419
because the mind gets ruined. I have seen
many people were ruined,

65
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,569
specially many seekers were ruined
completely.

66
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:54,606
I hope they are born again and get their
Self-realization.

67
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,861
The seeking is there, no doubt,

68
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:04,551
but all kinds of obstacles have come,
all kinds of temptations are there.

69
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:15,132
And so, despite all that seeking, earnest
seeking, honest seeking,

70
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:21,572
they have fallen into traps, which I cannot
explain

71
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:27,621
why should it have happened, but it has
happened - one has to see.

72
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:34,706
It's a - makes you very miserable, unhappy.

73
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:41,477
But still so many are there, you are there,
saved now.

74
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:48,589
And in this Last Judgment you have risen
from that level

75
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,983
to this new level, where I am sure

76
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:58,745
you will be able to salvage many more.

77
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:05,443
Each person can salvage at least thousand
people, and so many of you,

78
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:12,385
if you try that, it would be of a very,
very great,

79
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:21,431
very great emancipation for this world
which we are all to save.

80
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:31,180
So one must know the first, first duty
of every Sahaja yogi now

81
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:37,277
is to save others, to talk about Sahaja
Yoga,

82
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:45,495
to work out Sahaja Yoga in different
places.

83
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:50,072
For example now, I was surprised that they
are working out

84
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:58,149
on children who are abused. They are also
in India, we are working out

85
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:04,004
on various places like prisons, armies.

86
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:08,859
So you can enter into all kinds
of activities,

87
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:20,510
you can enter into all kinds of aggressed
places and save people.

88
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:27,018
But worst of all, I think, is the innocence
is under attack

89
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:30,647
in these Western countries, specially
in America.

90
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:38,622
The innocence is under attack and this is
something is very dangerous,

91
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:48,561
because the children get this mutation
at a very young age,

92
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:52,004
and what will happen to them?

93
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:58,850
So we have to think of all those innocent
children,

94
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:05,113
what we can do for them, how we can save
them,

95
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:08,226
how we can work it out.

96
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:13,894
The concern has to now go from yourself
to others.

97
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:19,228
You got your realization alright; you
corrected yourself,

98
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:26,499
you are absolutely perfecting yourself;
all this is there,

99
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:31,439
but now what is to be done?

100
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:38,986
For what is this light enlightened here?
It is for others.

101
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:45,645
So now Sahaja yogis have to live for others,
and not for themselves.

102
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:49,681
They'll have all the energy, they'll have
all the support

103
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:54,856
and they'll have all the blessings. So we
have to live for others.

104
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:59,847
And how do we live for others - is very
simple,

105
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:05,245
is to have concern, concern about
everything.

106
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:11,662
You have concern about the Mother
Earth, concern about your neighbors,

107
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:19,091
concern about the people who's suffering
all over the world.

108
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:25,154
If you read the newspaper you will be
amazed how

109
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:30,916
things are happening, how people are
suffering.

110
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,078
We have to understand fundamentally

111
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,387
that unless and until transformation takes
place,

112
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:44,111
we cannot change this world. And you all
can transform others,

113
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:49,899
so it's your duty, it's your job
to transform other people

114
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,646
and tell them what is divine love.

115
00:12:55,846 --> 00:13:00,167
Love is the only way now we can work out.

116
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:08,991
It is something like a big, big hole which
should go into this darkness of aggression,

117
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:16,930
and which will clarify many places, many
hearts, many people.

118
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:28,029
It is a ocean, we should say, ocean
of greatness.

119
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:34,013
This divine love is so great

120
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:42,404
and so powerful, at the same time so very
gentle

121
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:48,107
that you can see the nature, how, how
the trees grow:

122
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:57,545
every leaf gets the sunshine, every tree
has its own position.

123
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:00,967
We have to learn so much from the nature,

124
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:07,056
because nature is bound with that love.

125
00:14:07,469 --> 00:14:12,908
Nature has no aggressiveness.

126
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:20,460
It is just under the complete control
of the divine love.

127
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:26,264
With this understanding you should also
know

128
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:32,535
that when you are getting to Sahaja yogis

129
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:38,399
what should be your attitude: how you
should move,

130
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,013
how you should talk to them, how you should
understand them,

131
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:47,593
how you should express your love.

132
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:55,570
This is quite possible now, it's not
difficult.

133
00:14:55,771 --> 00:15:00,558
You should not be afraid, not feel shy.

134
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:09,449
But in a sweet manner you can talk to them,

135
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,585
you can communicate with them, you can
tell them;

136
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:24,446
because this was the time, this was
to happen,

137
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:28,324
that's the reason Adi Shakti had to come.

138
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:32,650
Without Her, it would not have been
possible.

139
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:37,317
All other incarnations were there,

140
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:41,956
but firstly, they were only on one chakras,

141
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:45,900
and another one was they had to establish
themselves

142
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,498
with other people, with the people around.

143
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,867
They did try and they worked it out,

144
00:15:54,067 --> 00:16:00,021
but it didn't really work in the real sense
of the word.

145
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:07,807
So Adi Shakti had to come, who has all
of them with Her.

146
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:14,883
They're all with us, all the time wanting
to help you

147
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:23,903
to do everything that you want to achieve.
It is there with -

148
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:33,116
these holy vibrations are with you

149
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:37,960
for every kind of good work you want to do,

150
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:42,167
any kind of Sahaj work you want to do,

151
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:48,329
these vibrations will definitely be there
to guide you,

152
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:56,542
 to help you, to support you and to love
you. You will be amazed how

153
00:16:56,742 --> 00:17:01,140
people, once they start working for Sahaja
Yoga,

154
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:06,207
how they are blessed from every angle.

155
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:15,122
So, one has to decide in their own minds

156
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:23,026
that all your dreams have to come true.

157
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:29,834
So only thing what you have to do is
to know only that

158
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:38,336
your purpose of life is to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

159
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:42,659
Even now many Sahaja yogis write to Me,

160
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,307
"Mother, this is happening to me, that is
happening,

161
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:52,084
my father like that, mother like that" -
but very few.

162
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:56,301
Practically this is over now.

163
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:03,691
They used to write, I should say, all such
letters,

164
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:09,390
but now I think they are all been perfected,
I don't know what has happened.

165
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:19,195
It's a very unique time where there's light
everywhere,

166
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:30,445
the nature is absolutely with you. You can
see how nature acts,

167
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:34,741
how it is trying to help you and support
you,

168
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:39,162
and how it wants to work out everything
for you.

169
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:46,577
It is to be just understood and felt

170
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:56,642
that you are something very special, and
that you have all the help,

171
00:18:56,842 --> 00:19:04,262
everyone of you. It's not one person,
two persons,

172
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:11,785
it's not ten persons who - it's the whole
lot, as if the whole ocean

173
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:21,482
is there to help you, help you to swim over
to save so many.

174
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:30,298
You haven't seen such an ocean where there
is so much depth,

175
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:35,841
and all the waves try to save you,

176
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:45,551
to make you float in the realm of joy.

177
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:53,731
All this has happened to you because there
is a purpose.

178
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:58,844
It's not just because you have done poorva
punyas and all that.

179
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:05,376
Many people say, "Because of previous life
we have got it".

180
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:11,134
That is true. The cause may be that,

181
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:18,584
but the result is that now you are capable
of giving realization to people,

182
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,390
and this is what you have to do.

183
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,719
All the way you have come here in this
wilderness.

184
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:34,752
From this wilderness only, you will rise

185
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:39,390
and you will bless all the people
of the world.

186
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,748
Specially America should be blessed again
and again,

187
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:56,293
because it's the Virat, it is Shri
Krishna's land,

188
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:04,760
because people will always try to follow,
to copy you.

189
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:10,555
Things will improve

190
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:20,226
if you get the, we can say the blessings

191
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:25,884
of the various lotuses you have within
yourself, no doubt.

192
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:31,881
But what about you doing something,

193
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:40,742
what about you doing something about it?
And this is what is very important.

194
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:46,361
Now only thing what you have to do about
yourself

195
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:56,759
is to find out about your own activities,

196
00:21:57,004 --> 00:22:00,861
what activities you have been doing.

197
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:08,388
You have to find out what have you done,
and what you can do.

198
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:16,552
When you meditate you think about yourself,
how much you have grown,

199
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:22,594
what have you done, what have you given
to others.

200
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:27,919
Whatever you've got, unless and until you
distribute it, it won't increase.

201
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:33,435
That is the fundamental law, and that
works. I've seen people

202
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:39,738
who are realized souls, who are very good,

203
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:43,026
who know everything about Sahaja Yog

204
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:52,719
but are not yet that much confident,
I should say, or that much deep.

205
00:22:52,920 --> 00:23:00,288
All this is only possible if you yourself

206
00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:08,536
get into creating new Sahaja yogis,

207
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:14,492
and more Sahaja yogis - not for popularity,

208
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:20,994
but for their good and for the good
of the whole.

209
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,410
I was asked that I should come and stay
in America

210
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:33,371
so America will improve very much. So now
here I am.

211
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:36,743
I came here, I stayed here,

212
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:44,442
and I am definitely putting all My
attention,

213
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:52,139
because it's a very important, very, very
important chakra

214
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,379
which is this, which is America.

215
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:13,238
And this very important country is doing
sometimes very stupid things.

216
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:17,342
I would not say that you enter into
politics - no.

217
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:23,160
I would not say you get into any opposition
and form a group - no.

218
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,294
But you also know that you have powers.

219
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:33,220
Even your thought, your desire has powers.

220
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:39,657
Try to experiment with it. Once you
experiment, you will find out

221
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:46,010
that only the attention that you put
to these things, it will work out,

222
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:50,045
I am sure it will work out.

223
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:59,026
It is a country which can definitely help

224
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:04,799
for the emancipation of the whole human
beings.

225
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:10,830
But on the contrary, it is going
on the other way round.

226
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:14,752
I mean, American culture, I don't
understand at all

227
00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:23,143
what is American culture is. Is something -

228
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:28,243
they say something, do something else.

229
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:38,237
They've no proper value system which is
accepted by everyone,

230
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:43,441
which is built traditionally from days
together.

231
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:51,078
The value system is so convoluted,
so twisted

232
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,490
that it's only a Sahaja yogi by his
nobility, by his greatness

233
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:01,906
can disentangle these people.

234
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:09,635
They have funny ideas, and those funny
ideas should not

235
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:16,129
deter you, should not stop you; for you
know that they are stupid,

236
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:25,620
they are destructive and they will destroy
all the, all the good qualities.

237
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:32,221
You should know that the responsibility
of Americans

238
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:38,804
is much greater than the responsibility
of any other Sahaja yogis,

239
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:46,274
because they are accepted and regarded

240
00:26:47,656 --> 00:27:03,945
as the most competent people, as the most
effective people by the divine Power.

241
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:11,376
Divine Power thinks that now you can go
all ahead,

242
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:15,907
you can do so much, and let us see.

243
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:21,017
Like we have the power and the machinery,

244
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:28,835
but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's
the use of the power? It is useless.

245
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:36,334
So the machinery has to work, and it is
working, it is spreading,

246
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:40,280
but we have to double our efforts.

247
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,392
I was thinking of doing some sort
of a social work here

248
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:51,770
so that it will go, it will be caught
in the eyes of many people.

249
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:57,836
On a subtler level we have worked,

250
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,281
but now we have to work it on the surface.

251
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:36,647
Subtler level we are there, we have
achieved and we can achieve much more.

252
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:44,580
But we should come out of it and think
what can we do on the surface,

253
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:52,943
so that people see what is Sahaja Yoga is,
and what it can do to people.

254
00:28:53,955 --> 00:29:03,444
It's your personal behavior, your collective
behavior, your national behavior,

255
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:12,193
all are going to change the atmosphere
which is supposed to be superficial,

256
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:16,607
so that that also becomes subtler.

257
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:23,318
I've been saying this in many places, but
at this puja I think it is important to say

258
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,181
that if you are really facing the Adi
Shakti,

259
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:32,871
then you must know your powers are
boundless.

260
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:40,007
You have to just assert those powers.

261
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:46,203
It is not a stationary power. It’s, there's
a movement in it,

262
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:49,837
and there's a right type of a movement.

263
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:54,624
It knows where to enter, how to work it
out. Now look at this place.

264
00:29:54,824 --> 00:30:00,358
Can you imagine Me thinking about a place
like this?

265
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,296
But I was just had in mind of course,
I must say,

266
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:08,212
that we should have some place here,
because

267
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:15,116
the American Sahaja yogis didn't have any
place to meet - that's all.

268
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:18,285
And see how I got it!

269
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:24,239
But the desire to do all this

270
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:30,866
should be there within your subtler level,
and then it works.

271
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:34,647
It works, it's like a magic, I tell you.

272
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:40,843
Now you have faith in yourself and decide
about it.

273
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:48,913
I am so very happy that it has been
achieved

274
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:55,425
with such ease - unbelievable, with such
ease.

275
00:30:55,626 --> 00:31:01,662
Absolutely, nothing great was done.

276
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:06,895
The way we got this was so simple,

277
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:12,603
that just like another Sahaja yogi
the person was to sell us

278
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:20,140
came down so excited, and he just sold it
to us, finished.

279
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:26,232
We didn't have to do anything to convince
him

280
00:31:26,432 --> 00:31:33,696
or to talk to him or reduce the price -
nothing. And he sold it out to us.

281
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:39,482
In the same way whatever on a subtler level
you desire,

282
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:45,950
it becomes a terrific force which moves
by itself,

283
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:57,251
which knows where to go, how to enter, into
which area, and it gets the thing done.

284
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:06,541
It's something we all should experience,
and work it out with full confidence.

285
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:12,396
It is the love that we have, the concern
we have.

286
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:19,171
This is the power that has given us
Self-realization, and this is the power

287
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:25,149
that has given us this enrichment
of achievements.

288
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,375
I am sure all of you who are here will
realize

289
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:35,638
how it was done - I mean, so quickly.
This is one of the things

290
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:44,357
that should just tell you what we are
capable of doing,

291
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:48,684
what we are capable of achieving.

292
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:58,037
And when you think of so many people who
are lost in the mire of ignorance,

293
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:03,036
we should really feel from inside that
concern

294
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:13,437
and that hankering, "How can I help these
people?"

295
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:18,003
And you'll be amazed, once you think like
that,

296
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:22,496
how this divine Power, this Force, will
come in.

297
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:31,342
Forget about petty things and petty
problems, they're nothing.

298
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,837
You have such a powerful thing behind you.

299
00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:41,709
It's true that all this universe was
created, everything was created

300
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:45,002
and then you were created, and all that
is done.

301
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:49,548
But the greatest thing this Power has done
is to create

302
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:53,860
Sahaja yogis. This is the greatest thing.

303
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:02,187
Those who have knowledge, those who have
the pure knowledge

304
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:09,974
and those who have the divine love in their
heart,

305
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:15,542
what a tremendous personality it is. Just
think of that,

306
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:24,195
and you will get all the opportunities
to express that love.

307
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,753
So may God bless you.
