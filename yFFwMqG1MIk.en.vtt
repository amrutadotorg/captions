00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:39.629
born with within us is the power which

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:42.720
can give us the status of a spirit we

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:46.439
are not yet the spirit we are at a human

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.869
level and in the evolutionary process we

00:14:46.439 --> 00:14:51.480
have to now have the breakthrough to

00:14:48.869 --> 00:14:53.910
become the spirit when you become the

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.579
spirit the light of the spirit guides

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:58.319
you you become your own master you

00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:00.899
become your own guru you don't have to

00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:03.689
have any guru product how do you think

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:06.179
that people have arrived in so many

00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:08.970
conclusions that they call religions and

00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:11.519
what is the connection between this way

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:14.759
of approaching ourselves the truth which

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:27.360
is one and your old tradition in your

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:30.059
country which I assume is India but it

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.679
is not just a certificate you cannot

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:33.649
take just a certificate and a born-again

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:37.139
it is something that

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:41.249
actualizes by which you develop a new

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:44.249
state a new state of your mind state of

00:15:41.249 --> 00:15:46.769
your being by which you become the

00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:49.709
spirit and there are powers of the

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:51.360
spirit which you manifest it's not just

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:53.759
talking and giving sermons and lectures

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.339
but it is something that's an

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:59.549
actualization is a living process I

00:15:56.339 --> 00:16:02.100
think we Greeks belong to the what we

00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:04.579
call the East part of philosophy of

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:08.189
religions this is a system which is

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:10.170
mostly esoteric it was seeking inside I

00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:13.889
think this is quite relevant and close

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:16.860
to the very ancient Indian tradition now

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:19.699
how close do you think very old

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:23.910
religious systems are and written about

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:25.230
the the pagan our own ancestors before

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:28.920
Christianity

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:32.250
even the Jewish or all the other Hindu

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:35.580
Buddhist and the rest you know this

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:37.610
especially in Greece you had the ancient

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:41.520
system of worshipping the goddess Athena

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:44.130
now in Sandstrom is the primordial so to

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.010
us is a primordial mother that we call

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:49.830
in our language as Adi Shakti is the

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:52.980
primordial mother and she has a mustard

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:57.180
see a snake in a shield and also in our

00:16:52.980 --> 00:17:00.410
hand that is the symbol of this power

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:03.390
within you which lies dormant in your

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:06.600
triangular bone called as sacrum so the

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:09.500
weeks knew no because otherwise they

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:12.890
would not have father Athena in our

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:16.200
scriptures this is called as many two

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:19.350
babies at the level of the universe

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.990
certainly it was a surprise for me to

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.100
see that you come here to preach our own

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.530
ancient gods

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:29.190
what are you telling us about Athena is

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:32.640
that the serpents serpents with Greek

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:34.740
gods are very familiar creatures having

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.930
do with medicine what is the message of

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.930
Athena coming from you again nowadays

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:50.430
fear into the fontanel bone of Xia's now

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.350
that's exactly what sahaja Yoga is this

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:55.680
power which we call as Kundalini because

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.840
it is like a serpent we said energy that

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.610
moves like a cell fantasy world symbolic

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.350
it is not the serpent recommendation

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.410
this is the power which is the

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:07.350
reflection of Athena within us and when

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:10.100
she Rises she goes and hits here and

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.270
opens out your fontanel bone that's

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:15.570
actualization of the baptism as

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:18.120
describing two-channel by that then you

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.490
are connected with that subtle energy

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.640
which is all-pervading for the first

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.950
time you start feeling that cool breeze

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.350
in your hand which is described is the

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.600
feel breeze of the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.070
is the same as Athena but I think

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.370
Christians could not connect it with

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:37.680
that is the same you have referred to

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.310
yoga and of course in this part of the

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.830
world

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.930
more or less familiar now for those who

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:46.140
are less I would like you to give us

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:50.010
some ideas about the wide spectrum of

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:54.110
what we would call yoga yoga is where

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:58.650
you goodnight is the union between your

00:18:54.110 --> 00:19:01.710
self with the divine is that's the real

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:04.140
spiritual yoga all other yoga's like

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:07.560
physical yoga are all that in a we part

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.960
of what one Patanjali wrote is a very we

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.850
part that to cleanse your body and all

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.460
that there people used to get

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.860
self-realization all right but one

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:19.650
master had only one decide gradually

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.930
started in a way that they started

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:24.540
talking about it from the I think

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.190
twelfth century became more open when

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.770
they started talking about it they

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.900
couldn't give ammas realization so the

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.690
only thing that I have done is to work

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.330
out the permutations and combinations of

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:39.390
human nature by which I have understood

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:43.080
how to give our masse realization and

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:45.540
that's the only achievement of modern

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.180
sahaja yoga it's not realize the ancient

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:51.990
system in India also must have been here

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:54.330
because the way the sacrum bone is there

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.970
and she is having all those things but

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:59.430
the practice of that may not have been

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.050
so open might have been secretive in

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.210
those days where they were giving

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.150
realization to people and it's ancient

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:10.100
times thousands of years back so but in

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:12.780

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:36.270

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.270

proper way

00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:56.210
another thing is you should not use

00:21:50.809 --> 00:22:00.620
things made by machines so much try to

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:04.400
avoid as far as these machines have

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:06.799
created so many problems for us we

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.340
should wear something that is made by

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:14.120
hand or by people who are using small

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:16.490
little sort of you can call ordinary

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:22.280
machines which does not require so much

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:24.890
of smoke to come up we should be very

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.260
conscious of ecological problems as

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.900

pollution so much of pollution how to

00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:43.520
fight this pollution is to be paying

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:46.669
attention to the ecology are we

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:51.770
producing all those things which is

00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:55.789
spoiling the atmosphere they are

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:59.330
responsible we have to do it who is

00:22:55.789 --> 00:23:01.970
going to do it we have to look after the

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.039
atmosphere which is filled with all

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:07.070
nonsensical things and take to a

00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:14.230

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:14.230
simpler by which we don't give so many

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:24.200
so many vehicles are so many things

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.600
which are creating problems there are so

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:32.570
many ways by which we can really be very

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:35.980
