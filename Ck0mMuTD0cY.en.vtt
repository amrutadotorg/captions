WEBVTT

04:44.083 --> 04:48.750
Tonight we have
gathered here

04:48.999 --> 04:52.999
to do the Puja to
the Devi,

04:53.208 --> 04:55.875
that is Mahakali
- we can call Her

04:56.041 --> 05:00.583
or Durga.

05:01.125 --> 05:05.417
So many types of
forms She has taken,

05:05.709 --> 05:07.875
to kill

05:08.083 --> 05:13.917
the negative forces that
are trying to trouble

05:14.125 --> 05:16.750
or to obstruct,

05:16.999 --> 05:20.917
or even to grow

05:21.125 --> 05:25.792
the people who were

05:26.750 --> 05:30.458
gentle and good.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.834
Her forms are of
different types

05:37.041 --> 05:39.917
that we know about,

05:40.083 --> 05:44.500
that She destroyed
so many rakshasas,

05:44.750 --> 05:48.166
She destroyed so
many evildoers.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.750
Also we do not know

05:50.999 --> 05:54.625
that, in the World
Wars that we had,

05:54.875 --> 06:00.417
She was there to protect
the right type of people.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.959
And that’s how
they all survived

06:04.125 --> 06:07.999
the ill-blood plan,

06:08.208 --> 06:12.250
ill-gotten plan
of very cruel

06:12.500 --> 06:15.542
and evil people.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.834
The evil people have
a capacity to hate.

06:21.041 --> 06:26.834
And to express their hate in
every way that is possible.

06:27.375 --> 06:35.041
They are really born evil and
there are also who ‘become’ evil.

06:35.667 --> 06:39.583
When they are

06:40.625 --> 06:45.417
born evil, you can
make them out.

06:45.625 --> 06:49.709
That their whole style
is so aggressive,

06:49.959 --> 06:54.291
and so vindictive

06:54.542 --> 06:56.250
about things.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.333
But hatred has no limit,

07:00.583 --> 07:05.458
no limits at all.
Because, if they hate,

07:05.667 --> 07:09.083
if they hate someone,

07:09.333 --> 07:15.917
then, just to justify that hatred,
they’ll say all kinds of things.

07:16.083 --> 07:21.500
Just to justify. But sometimes
they don’t even want to justify.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.834
They just feel that
they ‘hate’

07:24.041 --> 07:27.834
and it’s a fundamental right
they have got to hate.

07:28.041 --> 07:33.458
But these forces join
together sometimes to form

07:33.667 --> 07:38.917
to form a joint
personality of evil,

07:39.083 --> 07:44.333
which tries to torture the
human beings and trouble them.

07:44.542 --> 07:49.792
They might take any name. They
might call them by anything,

07:49.999 --> 07:55.417
but they are absolutely
hundred per cent evil.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.834
and for such persons

07:57.999 --> 08:06.250
there’s no pity or compassion
from the God Almighty.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.875
These are to be
destroyed.

08:09.041 --> 08:11.583
And that is the job
of the Goddess

08:11.834 --> 08:18.000
to destroy them, who is a Mother,
full of compassion and love.

08:18.667 --> 08:23.208
It’s a very contradictory
work the Goddess has to do

08:23.458 --> 08:28.834
to kill these people, because, in
the larger interest, it is important

08:29.041 --> 08:36.500
that all such evil people
should be destroyed, completely.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.458
But they do not.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.542
They, like they go to jail for
some time. Like that, they

08:43.834 --> 08:45.875
go to hell for some
time, suffer

08:46.083 --> 08:48.792
and, again, they come
back much more strong

08:48.999 --> 08:54.583
and then again try to trouble
good saintly people.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.709
It’s a common style

08:57.917 --> 09:04.166
they are all over the world.
They can come in the form

09:04.458 --> 09:06.625
of a very good man,

09:06.834 --> 09:11.500
of a very gentle man, or of a
man who “knows a lot about God”

09:11.709 --> 09:15.834
or they can also say
that they can

09:16.125 --> 09:18.625
give you Realisation.

09:18.999 --> 09:22.458
All kinds of lies
they are capable of,

09:22.792 --> 09:28.250
because they have that power
evil, power of doing evil.

09:28.458 --> 09:31.542
So they take to all
kinds of falsehood

09:31.750 --> 09:35.500
and they proclaim that:
“We are this and we are that,”

09:35.750 --> 09:40.208
and “ We can give
you this or that.”

09:41.291 --> 09:45.208
Actually, they have come on
this Earth to ruin people.

09:45.458 --> 09:48.625
We’ve had many of
these false people

09:48.875 --> 09:52.125
and many stupid
people followed them.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.417
They never talked
against each other.

09:55.667 --> 09:59.667
Christ has said that,

10:00.125 --> 10:03.667
“The devil won’t talk
against its own house.”

10:03.959 --> 10:08.166
As if they are in ‘one’ house.
And in ‘one’ house they live

10:08.417 --> 10:10.250
and they cannot talk,

10:10.458 --> 10:16.417
they cannot talk
of something

10:16.667 --> 10:20.875
that may disturb their
collectivity or their fraternity.

10:21.083 --> 10:24.667
The fraternity is so
great that,

10:24.875 --> 10:27.792
wherever they are,
they ‘know’

10:28.041 --> 10:32.834
that they are together.
Just imagine.

10:33.041 --> 10:35.999
all the evil people
should join together

10:36.208 --> 10:40.417
and behave in this manner
is very surprising.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.792
That way, they are
very collective.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.583
Supposing one has taken a
particular part of the land,

10:48.875 --> 10:52.250
then he dominates there. Another
takes up in another way.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.625
Third one takes. There’s
no competition as such.

10:55.959 --> 10:59.458
Ultimate effort is, somehow
or other,

10:59.750 --> 11:03.917
to destroy all the
creation of God,

11:04.125 --> 11:06.166
all the good people
of the world,

11:06.375 --> 11:12.041
who will ultimately get
their Self-Realisation

11:12.250 --> 11:18.125
and who will have the
Knowledge about Reality.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.250
This kind of atmosphere is
the worst during Kali Yuga

11:25.542 --> 11:28.834
and there are so many
stupid, stupid people,

11:29.083 --> 11:32.041
who may be simple, who
may be good-natured,

11:32.333 --> 11:37.291
but they get drawn by the
evil doing of these people,

11:37.667 --> 11:41.709
while the good people
also sometimes

11:41.959 --> 11:46.250
follow suite. They also try to
follow them. It’s very surprising.

11:46.500 --> 11:51.000
Why should good people not under-
stand what is good and what is bad?

11:51.208 --> 11:54.500
But, that discrimination,
many good people also lack

11:54.750 --> 11:57.625
and that’s why they
take to wrong things.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.834
And then they go on
justifying all the time

12:01.000 --> 12:03.542
whatever they are doing
is the right thing,

12:03.750 --> 12:08.083
is the best thing, they
have the proof of it.

12:09.291 --> 12:14.083
Now, as you know, there has
been many of them in Kali Yuga

12:14.333 --> 12:19.875
and so many of them have now
disappeared from this Earth

12:20.250 --> 12:25.750
and now they cannot trouble us.
But there are still some more,

12:26.041 --> 12:28.041
who are exposed.

12:28.291 --> 12:32.250
People have exposed
them so much

12:32.500 --> 12:35.500
that nobody can expose

12:35.959 --> 12:39.917
anybody without any proof.

12:40.125 --> 12:42.166
But they have such courage

12:42.375 --> 12:46.375
and they are so
full of confidence

12:46.625 --> 12:49.917
that they can do
what they like,

12:50.083 --> 12:52.583
and anybody tries
to expose them,

12:52.792 --> 12:56.667
they will definitely
ruin that person.

12:56.999 --> 12:59.125
A few things they
are doing.

12:59.375 --> 13:03.834
First of all, they put wrong
ideas into your head.

13:04.125 --> 13:07.125
They say that:
"We are very

13:07.333 --> 13:10.667
great people we are this, we
are that. God has sent us."

13:10.875 --> 13:12.667
All sorts of things they will talk.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.458
But there is no proof
about it.

13:15.667 --> 13:18.792
And human beings never
ask for the proof,

13:18.999 --> 13:21.458
as to: “How do you say?

13:21.667 --> 13:23.667
What is the proof? ”

13:23.959 --> 13:27.000
So the solution is
the Sahaja Yoga.

13:27.291 --> 13:32.291
In Sahaja Yoga, you have
the experience. You have the proof.

13:32.542 --> 13:35.458
Then you grow into it.

13:35.709 --> 13:39.709
Immediately you cannot be a great
Sahaja Yogi, that’s a fact.

13:39.959 --> 13:42.041
You have to mature.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.458
It takes some time
for some people.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.917
It takes some more time for
other people. It doesn’t matter.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.083
But you do mature.

13:50.291 --> 13:53.875
In the meanwhile, if you try
to go to these wrong people,

13:54.041 --> 13:56.458
then there is
no possibility,

13:56.750 --> 14:00.250
there’s no way of
again bringing you up.

14:00.458 --> 14:03.959
Especially those people who rise
high in Sahaja Yoga, I think.

14:04.125 --> 14:07.917
If they fall,
they fall so low.

14:08.166 --> 14:11.000
Then even an ordinary
Sahaja Yogi

14:11.208 --> 14:14.500
could say: “ Mother, look at him!
Where has he gone?”

14:14.834 --> 14:18.792
So, with all these
things happening,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.166
what is our job

14:24.709 --> 14:27.959
is to worship
Mahakali within us.

14:28.208 --> 14:32.875
Because, what does She do?
Perhaps we are not very aware of.

14:33.250 --> 14:38.208
First and foremost thing
She does is to protect us.

14:38.458 --> 14:42.667
Wherever you may be,
whatever you may be doing,

14:42.875 --> 14:45.875
in whatever peril you
may be,

14:46.125 --> 14:50.250
howsoever dangerously you
may be placed in life,

14:50.500 --> 14:54.500
She protects you. First
thing, She protects you.

14:54.750 --> 14:58.166
All the people who write to
Me, how they were protected,

14:58.375 --> 15:01.709
how they were cured,
how they were helped.

15:01.959 --> 15:04.542
It’s this thing: that
they should know

15:04.750 --> 15:10.250
that all this has happened because
of Mahakali power within you.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.875
She exists within you.

15:13.083 --> 15:14.999
When you are
worshipping Mahakali,

15:15.166 --> 15:17.583
you are worshipping the
Mahakali ‘within you’.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.792
With due respect,
you must know

15:19.999 --> 15:23.417
that this Mahakali is a
very sensitive personality.

15:23.709 --> 15:25.999
She is very sensitive.

15:26.250 --> 15:30.834
If you try to do any
wrong to anyone,

15:31.291 --> 15:34.875
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell
you by many ways

15:35.041 --> 15:36.417
that: "This is wrong what
you are doing.

15:36.625 --> 15:39.417
Why are you doing wrong
to some person?”

15:39.792 --> 15:41.792
But if you do not repent

15:41.999 --> 15:46.375
and come back onto the normal
position, She gives you up.

15:46.959 --> 15:51.458
Once Mahakali gives you
up, you are now exposed

15:51.709 --> 15:55.834
and become prone to all
kinds of evil things.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.500
I would say…

16:01.667 --> 16:04.792
“What’s the matter
with the baby?”

16:26.625 --> 16:29.208
So, when you worship
Her, what do you want?

16:29.417 --> 16:34.709
You want Her to protect you.
In your discrimination,

16:34.999 --> 16:39.417
in your mistake, you might
do something wrong.

16:39.667 --> 16:43.792
May do something that
is not good for you,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.875
could be very dangerous
for you.

16:47.125 --> 16:50.208
But She is the person
who guides

16:50.417 --> 16:52.583
how to avoid all
the dangers.

16:53.834 --> 16:57.500
Now, She protects
your life,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.750
She protects your body,

16:59.999 --> 17:02.999
She protects all organs
of your body,

17:03.208 --> 17:08.250
She is the One who gives you
all the security of life.

17:09.250 --> 17:14.625
In Her realm, you feel
completely secure.

17:14.917 --> 17:17.667
You are never afraid
of anything.

17:17.917 --> 17:21.625
Because you have left Her
realm, you have come out of it,

17:21.834 --> 17:24.917
that is why, that is the
reason you are afraid.

17:25.083 --> 17:29.917
But if you are under
Her beautiful

17:30.125 --> 17:32.959
guidance and Her
blessings,

17:33.166 --> 17:36.417
you will never feel
afraid to do anything.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.166
You will never do
anything wrong also.

17:39.375 --> 17:43.208
As soon as you’ll try to do
wrong, She will hold your hand.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.000
She is really the
guiding person.

17:46.250 --> 17:50.250
She is the One who actually
gives us our existence.

17:50.542 --> 17:55.125
Without Her, we
cannot exist, because

17:55.542 --> 18:02.959
She is the One who is
the Power of Shri Shiva.

18:05.250 --> 18:09.375
She gives us so many things.
For example,

18:09.625 --> 18:15.917
She gives us the
relaxation, the sleep.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.542
She gives you the Truth.

18:18.999 --> 18:21.625
She tells you what is the
Truth and what is not.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.250
Sometimes people

18:23.500 --> 18:26.875
so much in their ego
always try to believe that:

18:27.041 --> 18:28.750
“What I think is
the truth.”

18:28.959 --> 18:35.041
Then She is the One who points
it out by creating a ‘Maya’,

18:35.291 --> 18:39.291
a kind of a confusion,

18:39.625 --> 18:42.999
that you start thinking:
“What is this?”

18:43.208 --> 18:48.625
So She is called also the One who
gives us ‘Bhranti,’ means illusions.

18:48.875 --> 18:52.083
She puts you to illusions
also. She tells you

18:52.333 --> 18:54.875
puts you to illusions
and She

18:55.041 --> 18:58.625
then ultimately takes you
out of the illusions.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.458
She is the One who
relaxes you,

19:01.709 --> 19:05.041
because She takes over all
your responsibilities.

19:05.291 --> 19:07.500
She takes over all
your problems.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.959
She is the One who
solves all the problems.

19:10.125 --> 19:14.500
It is we who forget to leave
all the problems to Her.

19:14.750 --> 19:19.709
If you just leave problems to Her,
all your problems are solved.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.709
Not only that, but you
really feel blessed.

19:23.999 --> 19:28.166
It’s not only physical,
also it is mental

19:28.417 --> 19:32.834
that She makes your mind
absolutely free of worries.

19:33.041 --> 19:37.583
She doesn’t worry and She
doesn’t want you to worry.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.667
If you worry, then
She tries to show that,

19:40.875 --> 19:44.083
by your worry,
you are denying Her.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.709
You are not accepting Her.

19:46.999 --> 19:49.125
Worrying is something
very common

19:49.375 --> 19:51.041
and people take great
pride in saying:

19:51.291 --> 19:52.542
“Oh, I was worried.”

19:52.750 --> 19:57.542
How can you be worried when your
Mother is “Sakshat Mahakali”.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.500
She can kill all the demons.
She can finish all of them.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.458
She knows how
to manage things.

20:03.709 --> 20:06.750
And when you are like
a child before Her,

20:06.999 --> 20:09.333
how can you worry
about anything?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.125
So your worries
are finished.

20:12.417 --> 20:15.417
She worries about you, you
shouldn’t worry about yourself.

20:15.667 --> 20:20.333
That’s the point of it. Her
security is so great,

20:20.542 --> 20:23.709
She is so secure
Herself, that

20:23.917 --> 20:27.959
She gives you all the
security that you need.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.792
You can hold on
to Her feet.

20:30.999 --> 20:35.250
You can hold on to Her
image or to anything.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.417
You can even pray to Her.

20:37.625 --> 20:41.709
Many people are being cured
only by praying to Her.

20:41.959 --> 20:43.917
Because She cures you.

20:44.166 --> 20:46.083
She can cure your
diseases,

20:46.333 --> 20:49.999
which are very complicated
diseases. She can cure.

20:50.375 --> 20:55.250
Now what She likes ?
Mahakali likes the light.

20:55.792 --> 20:59.959
She is worshipped in the night,
because then we can put on the light.

21:00.458 --> 21:03.291
She likes enlightened
persons.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.999
Also She likes the light.
She likes the Sun. She likes,

21:08.166 --> 21:13.667
something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

21:14.625 --> 21:19.041
You must have heard about people
who are called… I don’t know what,

21:19.291 --> 21:23.500
but especially in the
West they use them.

21:23.750 --> 21:28.250
They have big teeth
and they

21:28.875 --> 21:31.041
somebody from the audience
shouts: “vampires.”

21:31.291 --> 21:34.999
And they are the people,
they just imagine,

21:35.166 --> 21:39.166
they cannot exist
before the Sun.

21:39.375 --> 21:45.166
As soon as there is a sunrise,
they just want to go off and sleep.

21:45.417 --> 21:50.458
Yes, they cannot see the Sun,
because, the light, they can’t bear.

21:50.750 --> 21:55.125
Now, what has happened here,
that Mahalakshmi, has departed.

21:55.333 --> 21:58.500
Mahakali has departed
from them.

21:58.834 --> 22:03.709
And when Mahakali has departed,
then they are afraid.

22:03.959 --> 22:08.208
And such people are
attacked by these people

22:08.500 --> 22:11.125
who know they are afraid.

22:11.417 --> 22:15.667
The Sun itself is
very important,

22:15.917 --> 22:18.583
to work out this
Mahakali thing.

22:18.834 --> 22:22.417
But, as it is, in the
West especially,

22:22.667 --> 22:26.208
we are very hard-working

22:26.458 --> 22:31.083
and very much Sun-oriented
and we worship the Sun.

22:31.333 --> 22:35.667
All this we do,
worship the Sun

22:35.917 --> 22:39.041
and also go right-sided
very much.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.875
Then it is She who
gives us the balance.

22:42.083 --> 22:45.458
She is the One who
gives us the balance,

22:45.709 --> 22:50.375
by relaxing us completely
and protecting us.

22:50.625 --> 22:55.999
Sometimes we are competitive
and we are really worried

22:56.166 --> 23:00.667
and we want to do something
which we cannot do.

23:01.041 --> 23:04.500
Then we get upset

23:04.709 --> 23:06.667
and we don’t know
what to do.

23:06.917 --> 23:11.709
Then it is She who
brings sleep to us.

23:11.917 --> 23:16.709
So, when we sleep, She looks
after us, She soothes us

23:16.959 --> 23:19.750
and She takes away
our problems.

23:19.959 --> 23:21.959
So many things
She is doing.

23:22.125 --> 23:25.709
But what are we doing for Her?
That we should see.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.291
Main thing is,

23:28.667 --> 23:34.667
that we are ourselves
worshipping Her.

23:35.834 --> 23:40.917
She likes it that Her
children should worship Her,

23:41.250 --> 23:44.792
that, on that level, She
can be One with them.

23:44.999 --> 23:49.999
She can give them Her
compassion, love and protection

23:50.208 --> 23:52.542
from all the evil.

23:52.750 --> 23:57.041
But it has to be
understood, those who are

23:57.291 --> 24:02.208
not yet settled, those
who are not absolutelly

24:02.458 --> 24:08.709
belonging to that land
of security of Mahakali,

24:08.999 --> 24:10.917
can be attacked.

24:11.125 --> 24:17.667
And they… once they leave that
area, they can be very badly

24:18.542 --> 24:22.417
injured, killed, whatever
way can happen.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.875
So, we are living in
this Kali Yuga

24:25.083 --> 24:30.834
in very dangerous times.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.166
Whence anything
can happen.

24:33.417 --> 24:36.208
So we have to be
very careful.

24:36.458 --> 24:40.750
We have to watch our mind,
to see how it works.

24:40.999 --> 24:44.458
What does it teach you?
What does it tell you?

24:44.709 --> 24:46.291
Try to understand

24:46.542 --> 24:52.542
what is the plan of
this evil person,

24:52.834 --> 24:56.000
that you are playing
into his hands?

24:56.250 --> 24:58.500
How can you play
into his hands

24:58.709 --> 25:02.959
and how can you do whatever
wrong he wants you to do?

25:03.291 --> 25:06.709
Secondly, against
Her is the ego.

25:06.959 --> 25:10.458
The biggest problem
is the ego today.

25:10.834 --> 25:13.792
Ego will show:
“No, no, I can do this.”

25:13.999 --> 25:17.458
Ego says:
“I will work it out.”

25:17.917 --> 25:20.667
Ego says:
“It will be done.”

25:20.917 --> 25:25.417
But the human beings –
see – yield to ego.

25:25.667 --> 25:30.500
It’s of a great satisfaction to
them that their ego is so strong.

25:30.750 --> 25:36.166
and they don’t want to listen
to the Mahakali forces.

25:38.125 --> 25:41.333
Take the boy (Anant)
outside.

25:45.125 --> 25:48.166
He wants Me, you see.
Children are like that.

25:48.375 --> 25:51.999
They can’t leave
you for even…

25:57.208 --> 26:01.375
You have to be like children.
Really, that’s the very best way,

26:01.583 --> 26:05.999
is to be innocent like children.
She loves innocent people.

26:06.250 --> 26:10.041
She is Innocence Herself.
She loves innocent people

26:10.250 --> 26:12.709
and She looks after
you much more

26:12.917 --> 26:15.333
because you are innocent.
You are not cunning.

26:15.583 --> 26:19.291
You are not very much...

26:20.542 --> 26:25.291
trying to play your
ego on others.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.583
If you are innocent,
She’ll help you.

26:28.834 --> 26:30.999
She definitely will
help you.

26:31.208 --> 26:34.750
But this ego has to be
brought under control,

26:34.999 --> 26:38.834
because he is
the worst enemy

26:39.041 --> 26:42.083
She has. She doesn’t
like your ego.

26:42.291 --> 26:45.458
She wants you to be
ego-less, to be innocent.

26:45.667 --> 26:52.083
As you know that it is, first She
came and She created Shri Ganesha

26:52.458 --> 26:55.834
That’s why we worship
Shri Ganesha.

26:56.333 --> 26:57.999
We have to be innocent.

26:58.208 --> 27:02.500
Means: we are not
planning to do something

27:02.750 --> 27:07.583
bad or good or anything, but
we are without any intentions.

27:07.792 --> 27:15.667
We are just…It’s
a timeless activity.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.875
You just don’t bother about
what you are going to do,

27:19.083 --> 27:21.792
what you are not going to do,
what you should do.

27:21.999 --> 27:23.375
Nothing of the kind!

27:23.625 --> 27:28.166
You are just existing
in your complete innocence

27:28.417 --> 27:32.041
and enjoying yourself and
making others enjoy.

27:32.250 --> 27:36.500
If there’s one child in the house,
he can make hundred people dance.

27:36.750 --> 27:42.583
It’s like that. Because these
children have the power of innocence.

27:42.834 --> 27:48.250
and that is what She respects.
We sometimes feel that,

27:49.125 --> 27:51.959
how people are cheats.
How they cheat us!

27:52.125 --> 27:56.458
How they make
all kinds of,

27:57.208 --> 28:02.291
I should say - aggressiveness!
Sometimes, how they try to

28:02.542 --> 28:04.375
also tell lies!

28:04.583 --> 28:07.208
All kinds of things
they will do

28:07.458 --> 28:10.208
and they expect so
much from you also.

28:10.458 --> 28:15.291
But all this is
happening… is happening.

28:15.542 --> 28:17.375
You shouldn’t bother
about these things.

28:17.625 --> 28:19.583
You should keep
to your innocence

28:19.792 --> 28:24.166
and, you’ll be surprised,
you’ll be completely protected.

28:25.083 --> 28:30.041
How? Because Mahakali
will stand around you.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.250
She will look after you,
if you are innocent.

28:34.542 --> 28:39.083
Innocent person doesn’t get angry.
What is there to get angry?

28:39.333 --> 28:44.333
Innocence has its
own, I should say,

28:44.583 --> 28:49.375
strength, power. It’s
extremely powerful.

28:49.625 --> 28:52.999
Even a cruel man,
if he sees a child,

28:53.208 --> 28:56.792
he becomes a little bit aware
of it: “There’s a child.”

28:56.999 --> 29:00.667
The whole world is aware
that children should not be

29:00.917 --> 29:03.500
any way tortured
or troubled. Why?

29:03.792 --> 29:09.542
Because children are so innocent.
So the quality of innocence

29:09.792 --> 29:12.750
is going to really
help you very much,

29:12.999 --> 29:18.667
because She appreciates
your quality of innocence.

29:19.500 --> 29:23.959
Then another thing She loves
in you is your compassion.

29:24.208 --> 29:27.999
Compassion for each other.
Love for each other.

29:28.208 --> 29:33.375
Also caring for others. That
is something She loves.

29:33.792 --> 29:36.709
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if
you are a Realised Soul,

29:36.999 --> 29:38.250
She is always with you.

29:38.500 --> 29:43.417
But She says: “What are you
doing with your compassion?

29:43.667 --> 29:45.999
How many people you are
giving Realisation?

29:46.208 --> 29:50.166
How many people
you are curing?

29:50.458 --> 29:52.375
How many people
you are helping?

29:52.667 --> 29:55.917
She is quite aware of
whatever you are doing.

29:56.083 --> 30:00.583
I should say, it’s such a
tremendous power of Mahakali

30:00.834 --> 30:03.917
that She knows
everything about you.

30:04.125 --> 30:06.542
Everything! She knows
your mind.

30:06.792 --> 30:08.500
She knows about
your heart.

30:08.792 --> 30:10.583
She knows about
your health.

30:10.834 --> 30:14.999
Everything  She knows.
Actually, She is the Mother,

30:15.208 --> 30:19.959
in every way, who cares
for the little child.

30:20.208 --> 30:23.875
In that way, She knows that
this child doesn’t do anything.

30:24.125 --> 30:25.333
He’s very innocent.

30:25.583 --> 30:29.999
So, like, when you are very small,
your mother looks after you.

30:30.166 --> 30:33.999
In the same way, this
Mahakali looks after you.

30:34.250 --> 30:38.959
Then the Mahasaraswati
power comes in and She

30:39.375 --> 30:42.291
educates you.
She gives you

30:42.834 --> 30:47.041
other ideas of knowledge…
this, that.

30:47.291 --> 30:50.959
But, looking after
the child in you,

30:51.125 --> 30:55.583
looking after your innocence
and your compassion,

30:55.834 --> 30:58.458
is all done by this
Mahakali power.

30:58.667 --> 31:03.041
So, She is extremely sensitive
about Her children.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.792
Nobody dare touch
Her children!

31:05.999 --> 31:09.250
For Her, everybody
is like a child.

31:09.500 --> 31:13.458
Those who are Realised Souls
especially, She thinks are children

31:13.709 --> 31:16.166
and in no way they
should be hurt.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.959
Nothing should happen to them.
She is always following them.

31:20.125 --> 31:23.500
One can say: “If She is a ‘person’,
how does She follow them?”

31:23.750 --> 31:28.417
Because She is
‘omnipresent’.

31:28.750 --> 31:31.208
She is present
everywhere.

31:31.458 --> 31:34.917
Everywhere in your
life She is there.

31:35.333 --> 31:39.792
Especially with Sahaja Yogis,
She follows them up and down.

31:40.083 --> 31:41.333
Everywhere,

31:41.583 --> 31:43.125
whatever you are doing.
You are in an accident

31:43.333 --> 31:45.291
She is there to save you.

31:45.500 --> 31:50.291
She is like an angel behind you
and nothing can happen to you,

31:50.500 --> 31:54.041
if you really worship Her
from your full heart.

31:54.291 --> 31:59.041
Not for any gain, not
for any achievement,

31:59.250 --> 32:02.750
but for Her blessings.

32:03.041 --> 32:04.999
Her blessings are
very great

32:05.208 --> 32:09.792
and they really have
enriched human beings.

32:09.999 --> 32:14.000
They have enriched this Earth.
They have enriched everything,

32:14.250 --> 32:18.250
because of the
blessings of Mahakali.

32:18.959 --> 32:21.333
Of course, then, there
comes the Mahalakshmi.

32:21.583 --> 32:22.917
Her thing is that,

32:23.083 --> 32:28.500
in Mahalakshmi principle, you
become ‘sort of detached’.

32:28.792 --> 32:33.333
You start finding that:
“What is this world after all?”

32:33.583 --> 32:35.999
and a kind of a feeling

32:36.208 --> 32:41.333
of detachment comes into you
and you start thinking

32:41.583 --> 32:45.917
that there must be something better,
there must be truth beyond.

32:46.166 --> 32:49.583
Especially people who have
been tortured by bad people

32:49.834 --> 32:51.083
always think like that.

32:51.333 --> 32:55.834
That: “There must be someone
who will raise us from this.”

32:56.041 --> 32:59.250
Here comes the Mahalakshmi
principle in you

32:59.583 --> 33:02.542
which is the principle
of the Goddess

33:02.959 --> 33:07.208
of ‘Ascent’.

33:07.458 --> 33:12.291
She puts the ideas in your
head that: “What is next?

33:12.500 --> 33:17.583
What do we have to do? After all,
is this the end of our life?

33:17.834 --> 33:21.667
What is the purpose of our life?
Why have we come on this Earth?

33:21.917 --> 33:26.041
What is so special that we
should live on this Earth?”

33:26.333 --> 33:29.208
All such fundamental
questions start rising

33:29.458 --> 33:33.834
and then he just takes
to the seeking.

33:34.083 --> 33:36.542
In that also, you
have to understand

33:36.750 --> 33:40.000
the Mahalakshmi principle
is very, very,

33:40.250 --> 33:43.959
very different from what
people understand.

33:44.834 --> 33:46.625
They think -if
they are seeking,

33:46.875 --> 33:48.500
it should be intelligible,

33:48.709 --> 33:50.667
it should be through
their mindsall this…

33:50.875 --> 33:53.083
or could be rational

33:53.291 --> 33:55.458
or scientific.

33:55.667 --> 33:59.750
That’s how they move,
seeking the truth.

34:00.583 --> 34:02.417
It’s not possible!

34:02.834 --> 34:05.166
Mahalakshmi’s principle
is like this:

34:05.375 --> 34:07.959
that you should have earnest

34:08.125 --> 34:12.625
desire to know the Truth and Truth
and Truth – and nothing else.

34:13.208 --> 34:14.999
When you think like that,

34:15.208 --> 34:17.417
then you will not take
to other things.

34:17.625 --> 34:19.625
So many people took to drugs,

34:19.875 --> 34:23.999
thinking that, by doing that, they
will achieve their Self-Realisation.

34:24.166 --> 34:25.583
It’s a wrong idea.

34:25.834 --> 34:30.792
How can you get away from your awareness?
Can achieve that?

34:31.000 --> 34:35.250
Awareness is the most
important thing.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.208
If you can go

34:38.834 --> 34:42.458
into the realm
of awareness,

34:42.709 --> 34:47.208
then you have to understand that the
basic awareness is not to be lost.

34:47.458 --> 34:49.417
If your basic awareness
is lost,

34:49.709 --> 34:53.999
through drinking or through drugs
or all these things that people do.

34:54.166 --> 34:57.250
They think that they are seeking,
that’s why they are doing.

34:57.458 --> 35:03.667
So sometimes they take excuse of
‘seeking’ to do wrong things.

35:04.208 --> 35:07.750
It’s like a revenge on
your Self, I think,

35:07.959 --> 35:09.709
that you want
to revenge yourself

35:09.917 --> 35:14.542
by thinking that you
are now ‘seeking’.

35:14.792 --> 35:16.834
It’s not the real seeking.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.999
In a real seeking, a person
has to just meditate

35:22.208 --> 35:25.500
and should find out
what is the right way.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.333
But, that too, not by
reading some books

35:28.542 --> 35:31.083
or listening to
some false gurus.

35:31.291 --> 35:35.583
Actually, Kundalini
awakening is the only way

35:35.834 --> 35:39.291
one can know the Reality.
There’s no other way out.

35:39.542 --> 35:43.583
But nobody tells them that
it is Kundalini awakening.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.709
They’ll tell you:
“We’ll go to this place,

35:45.959 --> 35:48.208
then to that place,
then more to that place.

35:48.458 --> 35:49.709
Then this has
to be done…

35:49.959 --> 35:53.125
And, ultimately, where do
you come? Where you started!

35:53.625 --> 35:57.750
Just like that: moving
from places to places.

35:57.999 --> 36:01.208
Moving from false

36:01.458 --> 36:05.417
to another false, to another
false,… to falsehood.

36:05.917 --> 36:09.041
Ultimately so many
seekers have been lost.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.792
So many have been
lost, because

36:13.250 --> 36:19.375
they thought that certain
type of… is very precious,

36:19.792 --> 36:21.333
seeking is very ‘precious’,

36:21.583 --> 36:24.917
because you can pay lots
of money to the guru.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.041
I mean, you can
‘purchase’ the guru.

36:27.291 --> 36:30.834
And so: “All the rich people
can become enlightened.”

36:30.999 --> 36:32.166
That means that.

36:32.375 --> 36:37.583
But I don’t think that the percent-
age of good people are only rich.

36:37.834 --> 36:39.999
The people who are

36:40.208 --> 36:44.500
good are good. Whether they are
rich or not is not the point.

36:44.792 --> 36:48.417
But such people try to
gather round a person,

36:48.625 --> 36:52.542
because, I think, there’s a
subtle ego of their money,

36:52.792 --> 36:56.166
that: “We can afford to
buy this, buy that.”

36:56.667 --> 37:01.125
Once I was in America and there
was one lady who came to see Me

37:01.375 --> 37:05.583
and she didn’t know that I
was… a spiritual person.

37:05.834 --> 37:10.250
So she said: “Now there’s a very
good guru who has come to America.”

37:10.542 --> 37:12.083
I said: “Really?
What does he do?

37:12.375 --> 37:15.917
She said: “There’s a sale
on.” I said: “Really?”

37:16.208 --> 37:19.500
“You can pay him
half the amount:

37:19.792 --> 37:23.000
he can give you his blessings.
Alright?”

37:23.250 --> 37:27.709
Then next week, she said: “Now
the sale has come to one fourth.

37:27.999 --> 37:30.208
If you pay the one
fourth amount,

37:30.417 --> 37:32.875
then he will give you
the ‘full’ knowledge.”

37:33.041 --> 37:35.667
I said: “How can
it be reciprocal?

37:35.875 --> 37:38.041
It’s not proportionate!”
I said:

37:38.291 --> 37:41.417
“You were giving half,
he was giving you half,

37:41.625 --> 37:43.667
and when you are giving
one-fourth, he is giving you full.”

37:43.917 --> 37:45.542
“That’s the thing”
she said,

37:45.750 --> 37:49.917
“he’s very magnanimous, you see.
That’s the point.”

37:50.417 --> 37:55.417
I said: “For all such people who
think they can purchase Truth,

37:55.667 --> 37:59.999
they cannot achieve it.
You cannot purchase it.

38:00.792 --> 38:05.083
You cannot pay for your
Kundalini awakening. No!

38:05.417 --> 38:08.250
Nor you should take any
payment for that.

38:08.500 --> 38:14.166
Self-Realisation is
absolutely the Divine Grace.

38:14.458 --> 38:18.375
And you cannot take
money for that.

38:19.166 --> 38:23.208
You cannot sell it. It’s not
so ‘cheap’ to be sold.

38:23.500 --> 38:28.834
If you understand that, then
the Mahalakshmi power works.

38:29.166 --> 38:31.041
And Mahalakshmi power is

38:31.291 --> 38:34.542
really meant for people who
are really genuine seekers,

38:34.834 --> 38:39.917
who are really seeking genuinely.
It acts and works so well,

38:40.166 --> 38:45.291
that they achieve a
kind of a very, very

38:45.583 --> 38:48.709
spontaneous Realisation.

38:49.166 --> 38:53.166
This spontaneous Realisation,
you all have got it.

38:53.458 --> 38:57.500
You don’t have to go to Himalayas. You
don’t have to do anything like that.

38:57.709 --> 39:01.999
All those things are over.
You have done it.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.792
In your previous lives,
you must have done it.

39:04.999 --> 39:06.542
Now you don’t have
to do anything.

39:06.792 --> 39:10.875
You can get it, you are getting
it just sitting down here.

39:11.083 --> 39:14.375
Wherever you are in the
whole world, you can get it

39:14.625 --> 39:16.500
and it is spreading
very fast.

39:16.709 --> 39:23.041
Now, it’s also the duty of Sahaja
Yogis to spread Sahaja Yoga.

39:24.041 --> 39:27.999
Now, this one is

39:28.208 --> 39:32.333
to be understood: that
Mahalakshmi and Mahakali

39:32.667 --> 39:36.417
both go hand in hand.

39:36.667 --> 39:40.917
When, you see,
Mahakali blesses you

39:41.125 --> 39:44.667
and She is with you and
you are in Her realm,

39:44.875 --> 39:46.792
the Mahalakshmi comes
forward

39:46.999 --> 39:50.709
and She definitely helps you
to achieve your Realisation

39:50.959 --> 39:55.250
and also to improve
your problems,

39:55.458 --> 39:59.417
to help you. I mean - the financial
side of it, you can call it,

39:59.667 --> 40:01.375
or in any way other

40:01.583 --> 40:05.709
problems also She solves. The
greatest problem She solves

40:05.917 --> 40:11.625
that your greatest desire to achieve
Self-Realisation, is granted.

40:12.041 --> 40:15.125
So, there is no competition
between Them.

40:15.417 --> 40:18.959
All these three powers
work together,

40:19.166 --> 40:22.999
and, whatever is needed,
they work it out.

40:23.250 --> 40:28.875
But it is the Mahakali who
guides where what help has to go

40:29.083 --> 40:34.375
and that’s why the power of
Mahakali is very much respected.

40:34.625 --> 40:41.041
As it is, She has killed so many
devils and so many rakshasas

40:41.291 --> 40:44.999
and there are still more –
some of them are existing

40:45.166 --> 40:47.291
but I am sure they
will be all finished.

40:47.500 --> 40:53.166
There will be none of these
horrible ones ever existing.

40:53.417 --> 40:57.917
But still we have to be
very careful and alert

40:58.083 --> 41:01.583
and try to find out what’s
wrong with these people.

41:01.792 --> 41:06.875
What are they doing and what
they trying to propagate?

41:07.083 --> 41:10.999
You must mature in
such a manner that

41:11.208 --> 41:16.333
you should know everything
of all these evil doers.

41:16.583 --> 41:20.417
You must find out what these
false people are doing.

41:20.625 --> 41:24.542
See, it’s really easy, because
you are enlightened.

41:24.792 --> 41:28.875
And with your enlightened attention,
you can definitely find out

41:29.041 --> 41:33.583
what’s wrong with
what organisation,

41:33.834 --> 41:37.875
with each evil man,
evildoer.

41:38.041 --> 41:41.458
It will be… the best
way is to meditate.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.625
Not to be aggressive
in any way.

41:43.834 --> 41:48.542
But just to meditate and
ask Mahakali: “Destroy!

41:48.834 --> 41:53.083
Destroy him, for he is destroying
the world. You please destroy him!”

41:53.291 --> 41:55.542
That’s Her job and
She’d love to do it,

41:55.750 --> 41:58.542
but somebody has to
tell Her and ask Her.

41:58.792 --> 42:01.917
It’s very good, because
there are so many,

42:02.083 --> 42:04.458
that unless and until
you point it out,

42:04.709 --> 42:07.917
She may not be able to put Her
attention to that - possibly.

42:08.083 --> 42:12.583
So it’s best is always
ask Her to help you.

42:12.792 --> 42:16.375
On individual basis.
On a national basis.

42:16.583 --> 42:21.333
Maybe on a collective basis
or maybe on a global basis.

42:21.542 --> 42:26.625
That’s what. She exists everywhere.
She is globally available.

42:26.875 --> 42:28.875
Anywhere: you may
be having

42:29.041 --> 42:33.792
any colour, any race,
any nation - anything.

42:33.999 --> 42:37.667
but She exists within
you all the time.

42:37.875 --> 42:41.375
And to worship Her
and to awaken Her,

42:41.625 --> 42:45.458
is only ‘your’ due,
that ‘you’ have to do.

42:45.667 --> 42:49.000
If She is awakened within you,
you’ll be a humble person.

42:49.208 --> 42:51.834
You will see what mistakes
you have been committing

42:52.041 --> 42:55.542
and you’ll feel bad about it.
You will not feel ‘guilty’,

42:55.792 --> 42:56.750
but you will feel ‘bad’,

42:56.999 --> 42:59.959
that: I will never do such a thing.
I have done very great wrong.

43:00.125 --> 43:02.417
And then you will
try to correct it.

43:02.667 --> 43:05.083
All this works out

43:05.291 --> 43:09.000
very well when you are
pure in your heart.

43:09.250 --> 43:13.417
Your heart should be pure.
If your heart is not pure,

43:13.625 --> 43:20.875
if you are doing Sahaja Yoga to
have some competition with others

43:21.041 --> 43:26.083
or with some sort of material
achievements, it will not work out.

43:26.458 --> 43:31.875
You have to do it in a way
that is an innocent act,

43:32.208 --> 43:35.667
that you are worshipping your
Mother like a little child

43:35.875 --> 43:37.709
worships and loves
his mother.

43:37.959 --> 43:41.792
It’s a very simple relationship,
which all of us have felt,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.709
how we should love
our Mother and

43:44.959 --> 43:50.333
how we should be under Her
guidance and under Her protection.

43:50.583 --> 43:54.208
That is something very simple you
have known in your childhood

43:54.458 --> 43:57.333
and that childhood has
to come back in you

43:57.542 --> 44:00.375
if you really
worship the Mother.

44:00.667 --> 44:03.834
May God Bless you.
