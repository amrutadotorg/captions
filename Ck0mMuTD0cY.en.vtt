00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:48.750
Tonight we have
gathered here

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.999
to do the Puja to
the Devi,

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:55.875
that is Mahakali
- we can call Her

00:04:56.041 --> 00:05:00.583
or Durga.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:05.417
So many types of
forms She has taken,

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:07.875
to kill

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:13.917
the negative forces that
are trying to trouble

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:16.750
or to obstruct,

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.917
or even to grow

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:25.792
the people who were

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.458
gentle and good.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:36.834
Her forms are of
different types

00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:39.917
that we know about,

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:44.500
that She destroyed
so many rakshasas,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.166
She destroyed so
many evildoers.

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:50.750
Also we do not know

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.625
that, in the World
Wars that we had,

00:05:54.875 --> 00:06:00.417
She was there to protect
the right type of people.

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:03.959
And that’s how
they all survived

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:07.999
the ill-blood plan,

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:12.250
ill-gotten plan
of very cruel

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.542
and evil people.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.834
The evil people have
a capacity to hate.

00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:26.834
And to express their hate in
every way that is possible.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:35.041
They are really born evil and
there are also who ‘become’ evil.

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:39.583
When they are

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:45.417
born evil, you can
make them out.

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:49.709
That their whole style
is so aggressive,

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:54.291
and so vindictive

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.250
about things.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.333
But hatred has no limit,

00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:05.458
no limits at all.
Because, if they hate,

00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:09.083
if they hate someone,

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:15.917
then, just to justify that hatred,
they’ll say all kinds of things.

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:21.500
Just to justify. But sometimes
they don’t even want to justify.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.834
They just feel that
they ‘hate’

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:27.834
and it’s a fundamental right
they have got to hate.

00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:33.458
But these forces join
together sometimes to form

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:38.917
to form a joint
personality of evil,

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:44.333
which tries to torture the
human beings and trouble them.

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:49.792
They might take any name. They
might call them by anything,

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:55.417
but they are absolutely
hundred per cent evil.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.834
and for such persons

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:06.250
there’s no pity or compassion
from the God Almighty.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.875
These are to be
destroyed.

00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:11.583
And that is the job
of the Goddess

00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:18.000
to destroy them, who is a Mother,
full of compassion and love.

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:23.208
It’s a very contradictory
work the Goddess has to do

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:28.834
to kill these people, because, in
the larger interest, it is important

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:36.500
that all such evil people
should be destroyed, completely.

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:39.458
But they do not.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.542
They, like they go to jail for
some time. Like that, they

00:08:43.834 --> 00:08:45.875
go to hell for some
time, suffer

00:08:46.083 --> 00:08:48.792
and, again, they come
back much more strong

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:54.583
and then again try to trouble
good saintly people.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:57.709
It’s a common style

00:08:57.917 --> 00:09:04.166
they are all over the world.
They can come in the form

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:06.625
of a very good man,

00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:11.500
of a very gentle man, or of a
man who “knows a lot about God”

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:15.834
or they can also say
that they can

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:18.625
give you Realisation.

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:22.458
All kinds of lies
they are capable of,

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:28.250
because they have that power
evil, power of doing evil.

00:09:28.458 --> 00:09:31.542
So they take to all
kinds of falsehood

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.500
and they proclaim that:
“We are this and we are that,”

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.208
and “ We can give
you this or that.”

00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:45.208
Actually, they have come on
this Earth to ruin people.

00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:48.625
We’ve had many of
these false people

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:52.125
and many stupid
people followed them.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:55.417
They never talked
against each other.

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:59.667
Christ has said that,

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:03.667
“The devil won’t talk
against its own house.”

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:08.166
As if they are in ‘one’ house.
And in ‘one’ house they live

00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:10.250
and they cannot talk,

00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:16.417
they cannot talk
of something

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:20.875
that may disturb their
collectivity or their fraternity.

00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:24.667
The fraternity is so
great that,

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.792
wherever they are,
they ‘know’

00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:32.834
that they are together.
Just imagine.

00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:35.999
all the evil people
should join together

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:40.417
and behave in this manner
is very surprising.

00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:42.792
That way, they are
very collective.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.583
Supposing one has taken a
particular part of the land,

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:52.250
then he dominates there. Another
takes up in another way.

00:10:52.458 --> 00:10:55.625
Third one takes. There’s
no competition as such.

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:59.458
Ultimate effort is, somehow
or other,

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.917
to destroy all the
creation of God,

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:06.166
all the good people
of the world,

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:12.041
who will ultimately get
their Self-Realisation

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:18.125
and who will have the
Knowledge about Reality.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.250
This kind of atmosphere is
the worst during Kali Yuga

00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:28.834
and there are so many
stupid, stupid people,

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:32.041
who may be simple, who
may be good-natured,

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:37.291
but they get drawn by the
evil doing of these people,

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:41.709
while the good people
also sometimes

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:46.250
follow suite. They also try to
follow them. It’s very surprising.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.000
Why should good people not under-
stand what is good and what is bad?

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:54.500
But, that discrimination,
many good people also lack

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.625
and that’s why they
take to wrong things.

00:11:57.875 --> 00:12:00.834
And then they go on
justifying all the time

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.542
whatever they are doing
is the right thing,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:08.083
is the best thing, they
have the proof of it.

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:14.083
Now, as you know, there has
been many of them in Kali Yuga

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:19.875
and so many of them have now
disappeared from this Earth

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:25.750
and now they cannot trouble us.
But there are still some more,

00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:28.041
who are exposed.

00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:32.250
People have exposed
them so much

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.500
that nobody can expose

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:39.917
anybody without any proof.

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:42.166
But they have such courage

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:46.375
and they are so
full of confidence

00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:49.917
that they can do
what they like,

00:12:50.083 --> 00:12:52.583
and anybody tries
to expose them,

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:56.667
they will definitely
ruin that person.

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:59.125
A few things they
are doing.

00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:03.834
First of all, they put wrong
ideas into your head.

00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:07.125
They say that:
"We are very

00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:10.667
great people we are this, we
are that. God has sent us."

00:13:10.875 --> 00:13:12.667
All sorts of things they will talk.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.458
But there is no proof
about it.

00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:18.792
And human beings never
ask for the proof,

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.458
as to: “How do you say?

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.667
What is the proof? ”

00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:27.000
So the solution is
the Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:32.291
In Sahaja Yoga, you have
the experience. You have the proof.

00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:35.458
Then you grow into it.

00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:39.709
Immediately you cannot be a great
Sahaja Yogi, that’s a fact.

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.041
You have to mature.

00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:44.458
It takes some time
for some people.

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:47.917
It takes some more time for
other people. It doesn’t matter.

00:13:48.208 --> 00:13:50.083
But you do mature.

00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:53.875
In the meanwhile, if you try
to go to these wrong people,

00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:56.458
then there is
no possibility,

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.250
there’s no way of
again bringing you up.

00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:03.959
Especially those people who rise
high in Sahaja Yoga, I think.

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:07.917
If they fall,
they fall so low.

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:11.000
Then even an ordinary
Sahaja Yogi

00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:14.500
could say: “ Mother, look at him!
Where has he gone?”

00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:18.792
So, with all these
things happening,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.166
what is our job

00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:27.959
is to worship
Mahakali within us.

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:32.875
Because, what does She do?
Perhaps we are not very aware of.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.208
First and foremost thing
She does is to protect us.

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:42.667
Wherever you may be,
whatever you may be doing,

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:45.875
in whatever peril you
may be,

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:50.250
howsoever dangerously you
may be placed in life,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.500
She protects you. First
thing, She protects you.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.166
All the people who write to
Me, how they were protected,

00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:01.709
how they were cured,
how they were helped.

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:04.542
It’s this thing: that
they should know

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:10.250
that all this has happened because
of Mahakali power within you.

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:12.875
She exists within you.

00:15:13.083 --> 00:15:14.999
When you are
worshipping Mahakali,

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:17.583
you are worshipping the
Mahakali ‘within you’.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.792
With due respect,
you must know

00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:23.417
that this Mahakali is a
very sensitive personality.

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:25.999
She is very sensitive.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.834
If you try to do any
wrong to anyone,

00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:34.875
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell
you by many ways

00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:36.417
that: "This is wrong what
you are doing.

00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:39.417
Why are you doing wrong
to some person?”

00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:41.792
But if you do not repent

00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:46.375
and come back onto the normal
position, She gives you up.

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:51.458
Once Mahakali gives you
up, you are now exposed

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:55.834
and become prone to all
kinds of evil things.

00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:58.500
I would say…

00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:04.792
“What’s the matter
with the baby?”

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:29.208
So, when you worship
Her, what do you want?

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:34.709
You want Her to protect you.
In your discrimination,

00:16:34.999 --> 00:16:39.417
in your mistake, you might
do something wrong.

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:43.792
May do something that
is not good for you,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.875
could be very dangerous
for you.

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:50.208
But She is the person
who guides

00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:52.583
how to avoid all
the dangers.

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:57.500
Now, She protects
your life,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.750
She protects your body,

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:02.999
She protects all organs
of your body,

00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:08.250
She is the One who gives you
all the security of life.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:14.625
In Her realm, you feel
completely secure.

00:17:14.917 --> 00:17:17.667
You are never afraid
of anything.

00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:21.625
Because you have left Her
realm, you have come out of it,

00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:24.917
that is why, that is the
reason you are afraid.

00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:29.917
But if you are under
Her beautiful

00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:32.959
guidance and Her
blessings,

00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:36.417
you will never feel
afraid to do anything.

00:17:36.834 --> 00:17:39.166
You will never do
anything wrong also.

00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:43.208
As soon as you’ll try to do
wrong, She will hold your hand.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.000
She is really the
guiding person.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.250
She is the One who actually
gives us our existence.

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:55.125
Without Her, we
cannot exist, because

00:17:55.542 --> 00:18:02.959
She is the One who is
the Power of Shri Shiva.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.375
She gives us so many things.
For example,

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:15.917
She gives us the
relaxation, the sleep.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.542
She gives you the Truth.

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:21.625
She tells you what is the
Truth and what is not.

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:23.250
Sometimes people

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.875
so much in their ego
always try to believe that:

00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:28.750
“What I think is
the truth.”

00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:35.041
Then She is the One who points
it out by creating a ‘Maya’,

00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:39.291
a kind of a confusion,

00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:42.999
that you start thinking:
“What is this?”

00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:48.625
So She is called also the One who
gives us ‘Bhranti,’ means illusions.

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:52.083
She puts you to illusions
also. She tells you

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:54.875
puts you to illusions
and She

00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:58.625
then ultimately takes you
out of the illusions.

00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:01.458
She is the One who
relaxes you,

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:05.041
because She takes over all
your responsibilities.

00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:07.500
She takes over all
your problems.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.959
She is the One who
solves all the problems.

00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:14.500
It is we who forget to leave
all the problems to Her.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:19.709
If you just leave problems to Her,
all your problems are solved.

00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:23.709
Not only that, but you
really feel blessed.

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:28.166
It’s not only physical,
also it is mental

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:32.834
that She makes your mind
absolutely free of worries.

00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:37.583
She doesn’t worry and She
doesn’t want you to worry.

00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:40.667
If you worry, then
She tries to show that,

00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:44.083
by your worry,
you are denying Her.

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:46.709
You are not accepting Her.

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:49.125
Worrying is something
very common

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:51.041
and people take great
pride in saying:

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:52.542
“Oh, I was worried.”

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.542
How can you be worried when your
Mother is “Sakshat Mahakali”.

00:19:57.875 --> 00:20:01.500
She can kill all the demons.
She can finish all of them.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.458
She knows how
to manage things.

00:20:03.709 --> 00:20:06.750
And when you are like
a child before Her,

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:09.333
how can you worry
about anything?

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.125
So your worries
are finished.

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:15.417
She worries about you, you
shouldn’t worry about yourself.

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:20.333
That’s the point of it. Her
security is so great,

00:20:20.542 --> 00:20:23.709
She is so secure
Herself, that

00:20:23.917 --> 00:20:27.959
She gives you all the
security that you need.

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.792
You can hold on
to Her feet.

00:20:30.999 --> 00:20:35.250
You can hold on to Her
image or to anything.

00:20:35.542 --> 00:20:37.417
You can even pray to Her.

00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:41.709
Many people are being cured
only by praying to Her.

00:20:41.959 --> 00:20:43.917
Because She cures you.

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:46.083
She can cure your
diseases,

00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:49.999
which are very complicated
diseases. She can cure.

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:55.250
Now what She likes ?
Mahakali likes the light.

00:20:55.792 --> 00:20:59.959
She is worshipped in the night,
because then we can put on the light.

00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:03.291
She likes enlightened
persons.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.999
Also She likes the light.
She likes the Sun. She likes,

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:13.667
something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:19.041
You must have heard about people
who are called… I don’t know what,

00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:23.500
but especially in the
West they use them.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.250
They have big teeth
and they

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:31.041
somebody from the audience
shouts: “vampires.”

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:34.999
And they are the people,
they just imagine,

00:21:35.166 --> 00:21:39.166
they cannot exist
before the Sun.

00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:45.166
As soon as there is a sunrise,
they just want to go off and sleep.

00:21:45.417 --> 00:21:50.458
Yes, they cannot see the Sun,
because, the light, they can’t bear.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:55.125
Now, what has happened here,
that Mahalakshmi, has departed.

00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:58.500
Mahakali has departed
from them.

00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:03.709
And when Mahakali has departed,
then they are afraid.

00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:08.208
And such people are
attacked by these people

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.125
who know they are afraid.

00:22:11.417 --> 00:22:15.667
The Sun itself is
very important,

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:18.583
to work out this
Mahakali thing.

00:22:18.834 --> 00:22:22.417
But, as it is, in the
West especially,

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:26.208
we are very hard-working

00:22:26.458 --> 00:22:31.083
and very much Sun-oriented
and we worship the Sun.

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:35.667
All this we do,
worship the Sun

00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:39.041
and also go right-sided
very much.

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:41.875
Then it is She who
gives us the balance.

00:22:42.083 --> 00:22:45.458
She is the One who
gives us the balance,

00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:50.375
by relaxing us completely
and protecting us.

00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:55.999
Sometimes we are competitive
and we are really worried

00:22:56.166 --> 00:23:00.667
and we want to do something
which we cannot do.

00:23:01.041 --> 00:23:04.500
Then we get upset

00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:06.667
and we don’t know
what to do.

00:23:06.917 --> 00:23:11.709
Then it is She who
brings sleep to us.

00:23:11.917 --> 00:23:16.709
So, when we sleep, She looks
after us, She soothes us

00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:19.750
and She takes away
our problems.

00:23:19.959 --> 00:23:21.959
So many things
She is doing.

00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:25.709
But what are we doing for Her?
That we should see.

00:23:26.333 --> 00:23:28.291
Main thing is,

00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:34.667
that we are ourselves
worshipping Her.

00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:40.917
She likes it that Her
children should worship Her,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.792
that, on that level, She
can be One with them.

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:49.999
She can give them Her
compassion, love and protection

00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:52.542
from all the evil.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.041
But it has to be
understood, those who are

00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:02.208
not yet settled, those
who are not absolutelly

00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:08.709
belonging to that land
of security of Mahakali,

00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:10.917
can be attacked.

00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:17.667
And they… once they leave that
area, they can be very badly

00:24:18.542 --> 00:24:22.417
injured, killed, whatever
way can happen.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:24.875
So, we are living in
this Kali Yuga

00:24:25.083 --> 00:24:30.834
in very dangerous times.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.166
Whence anything
can happen.

00:24:33.417 --> 00:24:36.208
So we have to be
very careful.

00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:40.750
We have to watch our mind,
to see how it works.

00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:44.458
What does it teach you?
What does it tell you?

00:24:44.709 --> 00:24:46.291
Try to understand

00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:52.542
what is the plan of
this evil person,

00:24:52.834 --> 00:24:56.000
that you are playing
into his hands?

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.500
How can you play
into his hands

00:24:58.709 --> 00:25:02.959
and how can you do whatever
wrong he wants you to do?

00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:06.709
Secondly, against
Her is the ego.

00:25:06.959 --> 00:25:10.458
The biggest problem
is the ego today.

00:25:10.834 --> 00:25:13.792
Ego will show:
“No, no, I can do this.”

00:25:13.999 --> 00:25:17.458
Ego says:
“I will work it out.”

00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:20.667
Ego says:
“It will be done.”

00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:25.417
But the human beings –
see – yield to ego.

00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:30.500
It’s of a great satisfaction to
them that their ego is so strong.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:36.166
and they don’t want to listen
to the Mahakali forces.

00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:41.333
Take the boy (Anant)
outside.

00:25:45.125 --> 00:25:48.166
He wants Me, you see.
Children are like that.

00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:51.999
They can’t leave
you for even…

00:25:57.208 --> 00:26:01.375
You have to be like children.
Really, that’s the very best way,

00:26:01.583 --> 00:26:05.999
is to be innocent like children.
She loves innocent people.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.041
She is Innocence Herself.
She loves innocent people

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.709
and She looks after
you much more

00:26:12.917 --> 00:26:15.333
because you are innocent.
You are not cunning.

00:26:15.583 --> 00:26:19.291
You are not very much...

00:26:20.542 --> 00:26:25.291
trying to play your
ego on others.

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:28.583
If you are innocent,
She’ll help you.

00:26:28.834 --> 00:26:30.999
She definitely will
help you.

00:26:31.208 --> 00:26:34.750
But this ego has to be
brought under control,

00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:38.834
because he is
the worst enemy

00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:42.083
She has. She doesn’t
like your ego.

00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:45.458
She wants you to be
ego-less, to be innocent.

00:26:45.667 --> 00:26:52.083
As you know that it is, first She
came and She created Shri Ganesha

00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:55.834
That’s why we worship
Shri Ganesha.

00:26:56.333 --> 00:26:57.999
We have to be innocent.

00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:02.500
Means: we are not
planning to do something

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:07.583
bad or good or anything, but
we are without any intentions.

00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:15.667
We are just…It’s
a timeless activity.

00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.875
You just don’t bother about
what you are going to do,

00:27:19.083 --> 00:27:21.792
what you are not going to do,
what you should do.

00:27:21.999 --> 00:27:23.375
Nothing of the kind!

00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:28.166
You are just existing
in your complete innocence

00:27:28.417 --> 00:27:32.041
and enjoying yourself and
making others enjoy.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.500
If there’s one child in the house,
he can make hundred people dance.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:42.583
It’s like that. Because these
children have the power of innocence.

00:27:42.834 --> 00:27:48.250
and that is what She respects.
We sometimes feel that,

00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:51.959
how people are cheats.
How they cheat us!

00:27:52.125 --> 00:27:56.458
How they make
all kinds of,

00:27:57.208 --> 00:28:02.291
I should say - aggressiveness!
Sometimes, how they try to

00:28:02.542 --> 00:28:04.375
also tell lies!

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:07.208
All kinds of things
they will do

00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:10.208
and they expect so
much from you also.

00:28:10.458 --> 00:28:15.291
But all this is
happening… is happening.

00:28:15.542 --> 00:28:17.375
You shouldn’t bother
about these things.

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:19.583
You should keep
to your innocence

00:28:19.792 --> 00:28:24.166
and, you’ll be surprised,
you’ll be completely protected.

00:28:25.083 --> 00:28:30.041
How? Because Mahakali
will stand around you.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.250
She will look after you,
if you are innocent.

00:28:34.542 --> 00:28:39.083
Innocent person doesn’t get angry.
What is there to get angry?

00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:44.333
Innocence has its
own, I should say,

00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:49.375
strength, power. It’s
extremely powerful.

00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:52.999
Even a cruel man,
if he sees a child,

00:28:53.208 --> 00:28:56.792
he becomes a little bit aware
of it: “There’s a child.”

00:28:56.999 --> 00:29:00.667
The whole world is aware
that children should not be

00:29:00.917 --> 00:29:03.500
any way tortured
or troubled. Why?

00:29:03.792 --> 00:29:09.542
Because children are so innocent.
So the quality of innocence

00:29:09.792 --> 00:29:12.750
is going to really
help you very much,

00:29:12.999 --> 00:29:18.667
because She appreciates
your quality of innocence.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.959
Then another thing She loves
in you is your compassion.

00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:27.999
Compassion for each other.
Love for each other.

00:29:28.208 --> 00:29:33.375
Also caring for others. That
is something She loves.

00:29:33.792 --> 00:29:36.709
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if
you are a Realised Soul,

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:38.250
She is always with you.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.417
But She says: “What are you
doing with your compassion?

00:29:43.667 --> 00:29:45.999
How many people you are
giving Realisation?

00:29:46.208 --> 00:29:50.166
How many people
you are curing?

00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:52.375
How many people
you are helping?

00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:55.917
She is quite aware of
whatever you are doing.

00:29:56.083 --> 00:30:00.583
I should say, it’s such a
tremendous power of Mahakali

00:30:00.834 --> 00:30:03.917
that She knows
everything about you.

00:30:04.125 --> 00:30:06.542
Everything! She knows
your mind.

00:30:06.792 --> 00:30:08.500
She knows about
your heart.

00:30:08.792 --> 00:30:10.583
She knows about
your health.

00:30:10.834 --> 00:30:14.999
Everything  She knows.
Actually, She is the Mother,

00:30:15.208 --> 00:30:19.959
in every way, who cares
for the little child.

00:30:20.208 --> 00:30:23.875
In that way, She knows that
this child doesn’t do anything.

00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:25.333
He’s very innocent.

00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:29.999
So, like, when you are very small,
your mother looks after you.

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:33.999
In the same way, this
Mahakali looks after you.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:38.959
Then the Mahasaraswati
power comes in and She

00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:42.291
educates you.
She gives you

00:30:42.834 --> 00:30:47.041
other ideas of knowledge…
this, that.

00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:50.959
But, looking after
the child in you,

00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:55.583
looking after your innocence
and your compassion,

00:30:55.834 --> 00:30:58.458
is all done by this
Mahakali power.

00:30:58.667 --> 00:31:03.041
So, She is extremely sensitive
about Her children.

00:31:03.458 --> 00:31:05.792
Nobody dare touch
Her children!

00:31:05.999 --> 00:31:09.250
For Her, everybody
is like a child.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.458
Those who are Realised Souls
especially, She thinks are children

00:31:13.709 --> 00:31:16.166
and in no way they
should be hurt.

00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:19.959
Nothing should happen to them.
She is always following them.

00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:23.500
One can say: “If She is a ‘person’,
how does She follow them?”

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.417
Because She is
‘omnipresent’.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.208
She is present
everywhere.

00:31:31.458 --> 00:31:34.917
Everywhere in your
life She is there.

00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:39.792
Especially with Sahaja Yogis,
She follows them up and down.

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:41.333
Everywhere,

00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:43.125
whatever you are doing.
You are in an accident

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:45.291
She is there to save you.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.291
She is like an angel behind you
and nothing can happen to you,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.041
if you really worship Her
from your full heart.

00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:59.041
Not for any gain, not
for any achievement,

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.750
but for Her blessings.

00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:04.999
Her blessings are
very great

00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:09.792
and they really have
enriched human beings.

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:14.000
They have enriched this Earth.
They have enriched everything,

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:18.250
because of the
blessings of Mahakali.

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:21.333
Of course, then, there
comes the Mahalakshmi.

00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:22.917
Her thing is that,

00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:28.500
in Mahalakshmi principle, you
become ‘sort of detached’.

00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:33.333
You start finding that:
“What is this world after all?”

00:32:33.583 --> 00:32:35.999
and a kind of a feeling

00:32:36.208 --> 00:32:41.333
of detachment comes into you
and you start thinking

00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:45.917
that there must be something better,
there must be truth beyond.

00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:49.583
Especially people who have
been tortured by bad people

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.083
always think like that.

00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:55.834
That: “There must be someone
who will raise us from this.”

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:59.250
Here comes the Mahalakshmi
principle in you

00:32:59.583 --> 00:33:02.542
which is the principle
of the Goddess

00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:07.208
of ‘Ascent’.

00:33:07.458 --> 00:33:12.291
She puts the ideas in your
head that: “What is next?

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.583
What do we have to do? After all,
is this the end of our life?

00:33:17.834 --> 00:33:21.667
What is the purpose of our life?
Why have we come on this Earth?

00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:26.041
What is so special that we
should live on this Earth?”

00:33:26.333 --> 00:33:29.208
All such fundamental
questions start rising

00:33:29.458 --> 00:33:33.834
and then he just takes
to the seeking.

00:33:34.083 --> 00:33:36.542
In that also, you
have to understand

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.000
the Mahalakshmi principle
is very, very,

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.959
very different from what
people understand.

00:33:44.834 --> 00:33:46.625
They think -if
they are seeking,

00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:48.500
it should be intelligible,

00:33:48.709 --> 00:33:50.667
it should be through
their mindsall this…

00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:53.083
or could be rational

00:33:53.291 --> 00:33:55.458
or scientific.

00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:59.750
That’s how they move,
seeking the truth.

00:34:00.583 --> 00:34:02.417
It’s not possible!

00:34:02.834 --> 00:34:05.166
Mahalakshmi’s principle
is like this:

00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:07.959
that you should have earnest

00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:12.625
desire to know the Truth and Truth
and Truth – and nothing else.

00:34:13.208 --> 00:34:14.999
When you think like that,

00:34:15.208 --> 00:34:17.417
then you will not take
to other things.

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:19.625
So many people took to drugs,

00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:23.999
thinking that, by doing that, they
will achieve their Self-Realisation.

00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:25.583
It’s a wrong idea.

00:34:25.834 --> 00:34:30.792
How can you get away from your awareness?
Can achieve that?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.250
Awareness is the most
important thing.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.208
If you can go

00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:42.458
into the realm
of awareness,

00:34:42.709 --> 00:34:47.208
then you have to understand that the
basic awareness is not to be lost.

00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:49.417
If your basic awareness
is lost,

00:34:49.709 --> 00:34:53.999
through drinking or through drugs
or all these things that people do.

00:34:54.166 --> 00:34:57.250
They think that they are seeking,
that’s why they are doing.

00:34:57.458 --> 00:35:03.667
So sometimes they take excuse of
‘seeking’ to do wrong things.

00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:07.750
It’s like a revenge on
your Self, I think,

00:35:07.959 --> 00:35:09.709
that you want
to revenge yourself

00:35:09.917 --> 00:35:14.542
by thinking that you
are now ‘seeking’.

00:35:14.792 --> 00:35:16.834
It’s not the real seeking.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.999
In a real seeking, a person
has to just meditate

00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:25.500
and should find out
what is the right way.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:28.333
But, that too, not by
reading some books

00:35:28.542 --> 00:35:31.083
or listening to
some false gurus.

00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:35.583
Actually, Kundalini
awakening is the only way

00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:39.291
one can know the Reality.
There’s no other way out.

00:35:39.542 --> 00:35:43.583
But nobody tells them that
it is Kundalini awakening.

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.709
They’ll tell you:
“We’ll go to this place,

00:35:45.959 --> 00:35:48.208
then to that place,
then more to that place.

00:35:48.458 --> 00:35:49.709
Then this has
to be done…

00:35:49.959 --> 00:35:53.125
And, ultimately, where do
you come? Where you started!

00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:57.750
Just like that: moving
from places to places.

00:35:57.999 --> 00:36:01.208
Moving from false

00:36:01.458 --> 00:36:05.417
to another false, to another
false,… to falsehood.

00:36:05.917 --> 00:36:09.041
Ultimately so many
seekers have been lost.

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:12.792
So many have been
lost, because

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:19.375
they thought that certain
type of… is very precious,

00:36:19.792 --> 00:36:21.333
seeking is very ‘precious’,

00:36:21.583 --> 00:36:24.917
because you can pay lots
of money to the guru.

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:27.041
I mean, you can
‘purchase’ the guru.

00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:30.834
And so: “All the rich people
can become enlightened.”

00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:32.166
That means that.

00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:37.583
But I don’t think that the percent-
age of good people are only rich.

00:36:37.834 --> 00:36:39.999
The people who are

00:36:40.208 --> 00:36:44.500
good are good. Whether they are
rich or not is not the point.

00:36:44.792 --> 00:36:48.417
But such people try to
gather round a person,

00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:52.542
because, I think, there’s a
subtle ego of their money,

00:36:52.792 --> 00:36:56.166
that: “We can afford to
buy this, buy that.”

00:36:56.667 --> 00:37:01.125
Once I was in America and there
was one lady who came to see Me

00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:05.583
and she didn’t know that I
was… a spiritual person.

00:37:05.834 --> 00:37:10.250
So she said: “Now there’s a very
good guru who has come to America.”

00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:12.083
I said: “Really?
What does he do?

00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:15.917
She said: “There’s a sale
on.” I said: “Really?”

00:37:16.208 --> 00:37:19.500
“You can pay him
half the amount:

00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:23.000
he can give you his blessings.
Alright?”

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.709
Then next week, she said: “Now
the sale has come to one fourth.

00:37:27.999 --> 00:37:30.208
If you pay the one
fourth amount,

00:37:30.417 --> 00:37:32.875
then he will give you
the ‘full’ knowledge.”

00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:35.667
I said: “How can
it be reciprocal?

00:37:35.875 --> 00:37:38.041
It’s not proportionate!”
I said:

00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:41.417
“You were giving half,
he was giving you half,

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:43.667
and when you are giving
one-fourth, he is giving you full.”

00:37:43.917 --> 00:37:45.542
“That’s the thing”
she said,

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:49.917
“he’s very magnanimous, you see.
That’s the point.”

00:37:50.417 --> 00:37:55.417
I said: “For all such people who
think they can purchase Truth,

00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:59.999
they cannot achieve it.
You cannot purchase it.

00:38:00.792 --> 00:38:05.083
You cannot pay for your
Kundalini awakening. No!

00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:08.250
Nor you should take any
payment for that.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:14.166
Self-Realisation is
absolutely the Divine Grace.

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:18.375
And you cannot take
money for that.

00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:23.208
You cannot sell it. It’s not
so ‘cheap’ to be sold.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.834
If you understand that, then
the Mahalakshmi power works.

00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:31.041
And Mahalakshmi power is

00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:34.542
really meant for people who
are really genuine seekers,

00:38:34.834 --> 00:38:39.917
who are really seeking genuinely.
It acts and works so well,

00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:45.291
that they achieve a
kind of a very, very

00:38:45.583 --> 00:38:48.709
spontaneous Realisation.

00:38:49.166 --> 00:38:53.166
This spontaneous Realisation,
you all have got it.

00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:57.500
You don’t have to go to Himalayas. You
don’t have to do anything like that.

00:38:57.709 --> 00:39:01.999
All those things are over.
You have done it.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.792
In your previous lives,
you must have done it.

00:39:04.999 --> 00:39:06.542
Now you don’t have
to do anything.

00:39:06.792 --> 00:39:10.875
You can get it, you are getting
it just sitting down here.

00:39:11.083 --> 00:39:14.375
Wherever you are in the
whole world, you can get it

00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:16.500
and it is spreading
very fast.

00:39:16.709 --> 00:39:23.041
Now, it’s also the duty of Sahaja
Yogis to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:24.041 --> 00:39:27.999
Now, this one is

00:39:28.208 --> 00:39:32.333
to be understood: that
Mahalakshmi and Mahakali

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:36.417
both go hand in hand.

00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:40.917
When, you see,
Mahakali blesses you

00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:44.667
and She is with you and
you are in Her realm,

00:39:44.875 --> 00:39:46.792
the Mahalakshmi comes
forward

00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:50.709
and She definitely helps you
to achieve your Realisation

00:39:50.959 --> 00:39:55.250
and also to improve
your problems,

00:39:55.458 --> 00:39:59.417
to help you. I mean - the financial
side of it, you can call it,

00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:01.375
or in any way other

00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:05.709
problems also She solves. The
greatest problem She solves

00:40:05.917 --> 00:40:11.625
that your greatest desire to achieve
Self-Realisation, is granted.

00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:15.125
So, there is no competition
between Them.

00:40:15.417 --> 00:40:18.959
All these three powers
work together,

00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:22.999
and, whatever is needed,
they work it out.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:28.875
But it is the Mahakali who
guides where what help has to go

00:40:29.083 --> 00:40:34.375
and that’s why the power of
Mahakali is very much respected.

00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:41.041
As it is, She has killed so many
devils and so many rakshasas

00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:44.999
and there are still more –
some of them are existing

00:40:45.166 --> 00:40:47.291
but I am sure they
will be all finished.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:53.166
There will be none of these
horrible ones ever existing.

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:57.917
But still we have to be
very careful and alert

00:40:58.083 --> 00:41:01.583
and try to find out what’s
wrong with these people.

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:06.875
What are they doing and what
they trying to propagate?

00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:10.999
You must mature in
such a manner that

00:41:11.208 --> 00:41:16.333
you should know everything
of all these evil doers.

00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:20.417
You must find out what these
false people are doing.

00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:24.542
See, it’s really easy, because
you are enlightened.

00:41:24.792 --> 00:41:28.875
And with your enlightened attention,
you can definitely find out

00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:33.583
what’s wrong with
what organisation,

00:41:33.834 --> 00:41:37.875
with each evil man,
evildoer.

00:41:38.041 --> 00:41:41.458
It will be… the best
way is to meditate.

00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:43.625
Not to be aggressive
in any way.

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:48.542
But just to meditate and
ask Mahakali: “Destroy!

00:41:48.834 --> 00:41:53.083
Destroy him, for he is destroying
the world. You please destroy him!”

00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:55.542
That’s Her job and
She’d love to do it,

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.542
but somebody has to
tell Her and ask Her.

00:41:58.792 --> 00:42:01.917
It’s very good, because
there are so many,

00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:04.458
that unless and until
you point it out,

00:42:04.709 --> 00:42:07.917
She may not be able to put Her
attention to that - possibly.

00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:12.583
So it’s best is always
ask Her to help you.

00:42:12.792 --> 00:42:16.375
On individual basis.
On a national basis.

00:42:16.583 --> 00:42:21.333
Maybe on a collective basis
or maybe on a global basis.

00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:26.625
That’s what. She exists everywhere.
She is globally available.

00:42:26.875 --> 00:42:28.875
Anywhere: you may
be having

00:42:29.041 --> 00:42:33.792
any colour, any race,
any nation - anything.

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:37.667
but She exists within
you all the time.

00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:41.375
And to worship Her
and to awaken Her,

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:45.458
is only ‘your’ due,
that ‘you’ have to do.

00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:49.000
If She is awakened within you,
you’ll be a humble person.

00:42:49.208 --> 00:42:51.834
You will see what mistakes
you have been committing

00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:55.542
and you’ll feel bad about it.
You will not feel ‘guilty’,

00:42:55.792 --> 00:42:56.750
but you will feel ‘bad’,

00:42:56.999 --> 00:42:59.959
that: I will never do such a thing.
I have done very great wrong.

00:43:00.125 --> 00:43:02.417
And then you will
try to correct it.

00:43:02.667 --> 00:43:05.083
All this works out

00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:09.000
very well when you are
pure in your heart.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:13.417
Your heart should be pure.
If your heart is not pure,

00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:20.875
if you are doing Sahaja Yoga to
have some competition with others

00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:26.083
or with some sort of material
achievements, it will not work out.

00:43:26.458 --> 00:43:31.875
You have to do it in a way
that is an innocent act,

00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:35.667
that you are worshipping your
Mother like a little child

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:37.709
worships and loves
his mother.

00:43:37.959 --> 00:43:41.792
It’s a very simple relationship,
which all of us have felt,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.709
how we should love
our Mother and

00:43:44.959 --> 00:43:50.333
how we should be under Her
guidance and under Her protection.

00:43:50.583 --> 00:43:54.208
That is something very simple you
have known in your childhood

00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:57.333
and that childhood has
to come back in you

00:43:57.542 --> 00:44:00.375
if you really
worship the Mother.

00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:03.834
May God Bless you.
