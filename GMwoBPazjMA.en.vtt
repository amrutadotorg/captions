00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:05.697
The other day I told you about the center of Christ

00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:09.056
and center of Shri Krishna

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:11.886
and their relationship with each other.

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:17.228
Now the last and the most important 

00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:26.700
one within us is the center of Sahasrara is the limbic area.

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:32.664
When you enter into it you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:37.354
This is the area to be entered through the Kundalini,

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:39.854
through the center of Christ,

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:44.251
through the Gate of Christ and that's why is written

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:48.667
that you have to enter through Him.

00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:53.368
But not by somebody else saying, "I'm the Christ" or

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.129
saying, "I profess Christ and Christ"

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.629
It's not that way. Christ is within us

00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.781
and when the Kundalini rises,

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.281
if it stops at this center,

00:01:06.093 --> 00:01:08.093
you have to take His name. Not

00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:13.432
the people who are not realized, but realized people have to chant His name,

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.493
then only the Kundalini pierces through that center of Christ,

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:23.257
that's the door, that's the gate He's talked about,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.511
and then you enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:35.133
"Thou shalt inherit the Kingdom of God." Inherit.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.633
That's your Father's Kingdom

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:40.847
and that you have to inherit.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.874
But now the most important is the last center of Sahasrara.

00:01:48.178 --> 00:01:53.619
When you have all the seven centers placed one after another,

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:57.669
these centers are really the seats

00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:00.169
of all the Deities we have talked about.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:04.861
The seats are in the brain,

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.800
their aura is around the heart

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.795
but they are actually sleeping in the

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:17.620
"Sthanas" as we call, the places of centers.

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:22.516
So, it is in three ways you can understand. One,

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:27.990
in the brain, there are seven centers of the seats

00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:32.599
and their auras are falling on the heart.

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.888
Their places are in the center.

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:46.278
And the first stage of the awakening of the Kundalini

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.778
only these Deities get awakened.

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:54.484
That means when you chant any word or you call Them by name,

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:58.681
They react. In the sense They open the chakras. You can

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.224
feel it; you can see it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.231
clearly with your own eyes the Kundalini rising through them.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.628
Then later on, when you grow more and more,

00:03:09.128 --> 00:03:14.380
these Deities leave Their places and occupy Their seats

00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:18.352
and even the Spirit, which is in the heart,

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:20.661
comes up here

00:03:20.922 --> 00:03:24.036
on the fontanel bone area where there is the heart,

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:30.443
seat of the heart center, which is the heart here, opened goes there.

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.484
But it is at a much later state,

00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:39.486
that state at a much later time, we can say much later

00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:41.871
state of your mind it's a,

00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:43.887
you get into that speed

00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:47.192
in which you just achieve that state.

00:03:47.256 --> 00:03:49.256
It is an achievement.

00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:53.763
It cannot be a false certificate from somebody or one can say this is written

00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:55.557
in the book. So this and this.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.350
There's no calculation like that.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.723
It has to mature in its living way

00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:03.475
and you yourself will know

00:04:03.527 --> 00:04:06.441
that you have got now complete Self-realization.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.799
First thing you get is thoughtless awareness.

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.227
With this you cross the Gate of Christ.

00:04:16.727 --> 00:04:19.991
You can cure people, you can raise the Kundalini.

00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:23.412
You may also be able to give Realization to people.

00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:26.928
But still you are capable of falling out.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.666
Supposing somebody, a person comes

00:04:31.753 --> 00:04:34.921
with negative forces and fanaticism

00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:39.125
he may encompass you. And you may go down.

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:44.168
But the second state is called as the doubtless awareness.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.263
If you rise into that then you have no doubts whatsoever.

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.734
You never fall down. Maybe your Kundalini comes and goes and

00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.915
supplies and sometimes you can feel the catches, it's all right.

00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:57.645
But after that,

00:04:57.846 --> 00:05:00.145
you are so sure of yourself

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:05.237
and of your achievement, your Self-Realization that you never falloff.

00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:10.309
But the last one is the very important thing

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:13.305
where many Sahaja yogis also falter,

00:05:13.336 --> 00:05:15.336
is the integration.

00:05:16.222 --> 00:05:18.862
For example, a somebody's born a Christian,

00:05:19.858 --> 00:05:20.928
he's born.

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.864
He could have been born a Hindu; he could have been born anything.

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:25.588
He could have been Muslim.

00:05:25.757 --> 00:05:27.757
Muslim I have seen one fanatic,

00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:30.365
like a Muslim if he a fanatic he is

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.509
born today as a fanatic Hindu

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.823
or a fanatic Christian,

00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:35.630
these are all fanatics.

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:38.625
They go from one swing to another swing and they profess.

00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:40.517
He will have Koran in his hand,

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.742
this fellow will have Bible in his hand and another will have Gita in his hand,

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.919
three of them are fighting.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.472
He says I'm correct, he says I'm correct and he says I'm correct.

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:49.977
Now what is the authority?

00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:53.330
Even of these books people will ask what is the authority of the Bible.

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:55.968
What is the authority of the Gita

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.140
and what is the authority of the Koran?

00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:00.171
They'll say what is the authority of The Old Testament?

00:06:00.671 --> 00:06:03.271
If they ask authority, what is the answer?

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:05.468
And you can ask what is my authority?

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.299
You must ask this question.

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.297
In the beginning people do ask what is my authority.

00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:14.074
My authority is that I give you Realization.

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:17.699
And you ask the question, "Mother are you the authority?"

00:06:17.868 --> 00:06:19.868
you get vibrations.

00:06:20.368 --> 00:06:21.975
This is my authority.

00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:26.975
Then you will understand why Bible is right, Koran is right and Gita is right.

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:30.137
Because of the narrow vision we have.

00:06:30.637 --> 00:06:33.191
If they are born as a Christian then they'll stick into it.

00:06:33.553 --> 00:06:35.660
If you are Catholics you will be Protestants, if you are

00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:37.040
Protestants you'll become

00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:39.269
a 7th Day Adventist, Pentecostals,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.547
this that, born again, this that nonsense

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:46.125
we go on ending up like that in a Christian genealogy,

00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:49.227
from one madness to another madness achieving nothing,

00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:51.396
believing into some sort of a theoretical thing

00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:54.501
like 7th Day Adventist.

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:57.812
I can't understand it.

00:06:57.843 --> 00:07:00.342
These theories and these things are not going to give you

00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:02.511
living experience,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.526
which is beyond rationality, which is beyond mind,

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:08.655
which is Baptism, the real sense of the word,

00:07:08.742 --> 00:07:12.021
where you get this breeze in the hand, of the Holy Spirit.

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:17.055
But we want to play about with these things with our narrow visions now see

00:07:17.224 --> 00:07:19.224
one case of Christ.

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:23.879
Christ was definitely, as I told you, was

00:07:23.908 --> 00:07:25.908
Pranava, Omkara, everything was there,

00:07:26.408 --> 00:07:27.569
no doubt.

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.204
But when He was born,

00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:34.116
there was signs and everything.

00:07:34.616 --> 00:07:37.501
Despite all that there was a king who wanted to kill Him.

00:07:39.257 --> 00:07:44.408
See the negativity. No intellectual accepted Him.

00:07:44.555 --> 00:07:46.555
No bureaucrat accepted Him,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.602
no educated person accepted Him.

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:52.261
He had to actually beg of those

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:56.511
very ordinary, mediocre people

00:07:57.148 --> 00:08:00.177
like fishermen to come and become His disciples.

00:08:00.677 --> 00:08:01.978
See the situation.

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:04.534
And He was allowed to live

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:06.143
only for 4 years

00:08:06.192 --> 00:08:07.657
by these horrible people.

00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:09.999
They may be born today as Christians and must be saying we are

00:08:10.003 --> 00:08:12.584
Christians and Christ and Christ and Christ.

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:14.972
That's why Christ has said I will not recognize you.

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:20.384
They might be the people who might have crucified Christ.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.372
And they're again crucifying Him

00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:25.264
by denying the living force of the living God.

00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:29.488
Four years.

00:08:29.556 --> 00:08:31.697
Now, what can you do in four years? I told you

00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:35.655
four years, with all my powers, I was struggling with six hippies

00:08:35.684 --> 00:08:38.214
giving them realization in London city.

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:43.424
He never even thought of giving Realization because He thought

00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:46.431
first of all they have no brains even to understand what is Realization.

00:08:48.482 --> 00:08:49.594
Whatever He said,

00:08:49.624 --> 00:08:51.879
He said it very precise and deep.

00:08:51.947 --> 00:08:53.947
If anything that is narrow has to be deep.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.067
Which cannot go into the heads of people who just listen to

00:08:58.078 --> 00:08:59.237
sermons and lectures

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:03.605
and read books and sort of have big theories built up into anything.

00:09:04.537 --> 00:09:07.819
It will only be possible when you get your Realization,

00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:13.064
when you get your collective consciousness, when you become baptized.

00:09:13.113 --> 00:09:17.368
Then only you will be able to see what He talked about.

00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:19.830
Before that it's only mental activity,

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:22.951
quarrelling, fighting and living on artificial things. 

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:25.071
How long are you going to do like that?

00:09:26.376 --> 00:09:28.931
Your forefathers did it and their forefathers did it and their

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.426
forefathers have done it.

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:33.436
Now is it not time for you

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:35.936
to see that a new age has come?

00:09:37.692 --> 00:09:39.341
What are you going to lose by that?

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:41.209
You form organizations

00:09:41.258 --> 00:09:43.258
false and false and false.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.660
There should be some honesty about it.

00:09:47.475 --> 00:09:49.873
Just talking talking morning till evening,

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:52.826
you are not going to receive any knowledge about Christ I can tell you.

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.839
This narrow vision of Christianity

00:09:59.968 --> 00:10:03.212
has killed Christ and Christianity good.

00:10:03.476 --> 00:10:05.476
The narrow vision of Jews

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:08.129
has killed Moses and Abraham.

00:10:08.413 --> 00:10:10.413
The narrow vision of Krishna

00:10:11.463 --> 00:10:14.035
and the narrow vision of all these people

00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:16.661
has killed them.

00:10:17.822 --> 00:10:20.656
They have dead in them. Your children are going to challenge you. 

00:10:21.156 --> 00:10:22.411
They are going to ask you,

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.135
what foolish things you have been doing all your lives.

00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:31.163
They are going to ask you why did you do it?

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.663
Have you any answer to give?

00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:38.294
For that one has to understand

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:41.038
that we have now found our absolute.

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:44.491
You be honest yourself. Have you found your absolute?

00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:47.165
We have not yet found our absolute.

00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:49.943
That's what you have to find.

00:10:50.443 --> 00:10:53.618
You are to be born again. Not to certificate yourself that

00:10:53.648 --> 00:10:55.648
I am born again. I have seen many people,

00:10:55.713 --> 00:10:58.044
I am born again. Really? How do you say?

00:10:59.206 --> 00:11:01.782
Can you feel the chakras of another person?

00:11:01.812 --> 00:11:04.401
Are you collectively conscious? Can you feel your own chakras?

00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:06.103
Can you clarify yourself is there any

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:08.045
transformation? No transformation.

00:11:10.182 --> 00:11:12.182
Then you have among Jews also

00:11:12.543 --> 00:11:14.874
very fanatic people. Muslims

00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:18.378
have lost

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.515
even the recognition of God's

00:11:24.015 --> 00:11:25.651
mercy and compassion.

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.810
It is such a sad state. At this

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.519
sad state and confusion,

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:35.391
there has to be

00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:38.239
the integrating force.

00:11:38.286 --> 00:11:40.985
And that integrating force is your Spirit.

00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:45.907
That integration takes place in this seventh chakra of Sahasrara.

00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:49.191
All the seven centers are there

00:11:49.778 --> 00:11:53.504
and all the centers are coordinated and co-related

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:58.020
and that's how, at the seventh chakra only you can get your Realization.

00:12:01.045 --> 00:12:03.380
He didn't allow any one of them

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.110
to say anything about it.

00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:08.978
If they try to say anything you brake bright out of the book,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.007
oh see this book is written it is written

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:13.019
in so and so and this is written so and so.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.519
Say for example when Christ was born.

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:19.168
It was said that

00:12:20.382 --> 00:12:23.374
a child will be born to a girl.

00:12:24.797 --> 00:12:27.481
Kanya. In Sanskrit language it's Kanya.

00:12:29.427 --> 00:12:31.829
Now in England there was a controversy about it,

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.754
Now I think the Jews started it maybe, I don't know who started it.

00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:36.467
Or maybe the Muslims.

00:12:37.228 --> 00:12:40.918
God only knows. They go into all these details of that thing to find out

00:12:40.947 --> 00:12:42.510
they said it was not said

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.820
that He will be born of virgin but it was said of the girl.

00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:50.487
So one of the Sahaja yogi wrote a nice letter to them,

00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:52.029
of course under my guidance

00:12:52.425 --> 00:12:53.670
saying that

00:12:53.822 --> 00:12:56.537
at the time when Christ was born, even before that,

00:12:57.437 --> 00:12:59.561
this prophecy was made and that time,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800
a girl meant a virgin.

00:13:02.178 --> 00:13:03.930
These are not modern times when

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.327
a woman who is divorced

00:13:05.444 --> 00:13:08.187
10 times and 80 years

00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:11.019
is her age, and she's still called as 'my girl'.

00:13:12.738 --> 00:13:14.967
These are foolish stupid modern times

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:18.977
where there's no difference between a girl and a woman.

00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:22.435
That time a girl meant,

00:13:22.611 --> 00:13:25.022
even today in India, Kanya means a virgin.

00:13:26.602 --> 00:13:29.142
Girl means a virgin. It's the same thing.

00:13:32.624 --> 00:13:36.027
All such things have been raised against

00:13:36.404 --> 00:13:39.592
either Christ or Moses or Mohammad or this and that.

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.814
I mean there only busy

00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:44.765
raising things against each other, that's what they are doing.

00:13:46.002 --> 00:13:49.081
According to them, what they say is the truth? What have they found?

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:53.265
First thing, can they cure cancer?

00:13:57.572 --> 00:14:00.627
Let's see, let's have this challenge.

00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:04.573
Can they give peace to anyone? Are they peaceful?

00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:09.653
Have they been able to get over their adulterous eyes?

00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:13.418
Any transformation?

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.319
Nothing.

00:14:16.644 --> 00:14:19.814
So accept it. Be honest with yourself.

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:24.099
You have no business to cheat yourself, or anything whatsoever.

00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:27.371
If you are hypnotized 

00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:29.871
awaken yourself.

00:14:30.038 --> 00:14:33.848
arise and find what is the best,

00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:39.684
absolute and the only thing that you have to find, your Spirit.

00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:44.664
Your Spirit resides in the heart.

00:14:47.374 --> 00:14:50.439
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:14:52.436 --> 00:14:55.088
It enjoys itself, by itself.

00:14:56.553 --> 00:15:00.728
It is the spectator of the world, of its power,

00:15:02.263 --> 00:15:03.214
The Holy Ghost.

00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:08.432
It watches you

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.635
and is called as the knower of the fate.

00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:17.620
It knows what you are doing,

00:15:18.383 --> 00:15:20.383
what are your aspirations,

00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:23.152
what mistakes you are committing.

00:15:24.108 --> 00:15:26.108
It goes to a long extent

00:15:26.204 --> 00:15:29.234
to forgive and forgive and forgive.

00:15:29.366 --> 00:15:33.095
Forgiveness is one of the qualities of the Spirit.

00:15:36.788 --> 00:15:38.788
It forgives you

00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:42.349
and says it will work out.

00:15:42.849 --> 00:15:44.849
It will come around.

00:15:45.349 --> 00:15:47.349
But when you go too far,

00:15:47.428 --> 00:15:50.258
say if you pay too much attention to your physical being

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.951
or to your mental being,

00:15:54.837 --> 00:15:57.750
if you try to think too much,

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:02.657
the Spirit indicates its displeasure

00:16:03.157 --> 00:16:05.157
and you get a heart attack.

00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:10.008
Heart attack comes to you

00:16:10.087 --> 00:16:12.087
through displeasure of the Spirit.

00:16:13.113 --> 00:16:16.111
If the Spirit is angry with you, you get a heart attack.

00:16:17.506 --> 00:16:20.326
That means you've neglected your Spirit,

00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:23.212
you've paid attention to things

00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:24.371
which are not important.

00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:29.590
You have looked after things which are not important.

00:16:29.792 --> 00:16:33.546
You have not worried about yourself, about the Spirit, about your seeking.

00:16:34.116 --> 00:16:37.449
Even if you're lost, say in any fanatic behavior

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.914
of reading some books and things and

00:16:40.063 --> 00:16:42.857
taking out certain things and remembering them by heart and

00:16:42.883 --> 00:16:46.439
having an argument and goes on later all that,

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:48.939
in all genuineness and goodness

00:16:49.057 --> 00:16:52.744
but stupidity then also you can get heart attack.

00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:57.353
Heart is very important.

00:16:59.299 --> 00:17:01.482
It sometimes gives you

00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:05.694
first warning by giving you a partial paralysis

00:17:05.873 --> 00:17:09.139
because in the heart is sort of a,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.776
resentment is created by the Spirit which creates a clot,

00:17:14.975 --> 00:17:19.150
a clot, and that clot when goes into the brain

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:22.505
you get a partial paralysis,

00:17:23.286 --> 00:17:25.286
so that you do not move any further.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.629
Your attention is taken to it.

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:30.848
Then you start thinking of God,

00:17:30.906 --> 00:17:32.906
thinking of all the things

00:17:33.406 --> 00:17:35.406
and maybe

00:17:36.227 --> 00:17:39.272
then if you come to Sahaja yoga you get cured

00:17:39.772 --> 00:17:42.600
because again your Spirit forgives you.

00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:47.878
We are taking too much liberty with our Spirit.

00:17:50.908 --> 00:17:53.861
It is true God has given you freedom

00:17:54.963 --> 00:17:58.307
and He is not going to take away your freedom at any cost.

00:17:58.807 --> 00:18:01.431
You have to be absolutely free to choose

00:18:01.469 --> 00:18:03.858
whether to go to heaven or to go to hell.

00:18:04.358 --> 00:18:06.358
He is not going to force you.

00:18:06.858 --> 00:18:08.858
Only thing one can do

00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:12.047
is to explain to you and tell you

00:18:12.206 --> 00:18:14.690
that this is the way you go to hell.

00:18:15.009 --> 00:18:17.009
Even then if you want to go

00:18:18.714 --> 00:18:22.183
then what can anybody do about it?

00:18:22.221 --> 00:18:25.766
Even God, He doesn't want to challenge your freedom at all.

00:18:26.266 --> 00:18:28.894
He doesn't want to make you, in any way

00:18:29.053 --> 00:18:31.053
bound to Him, like some people are,

00:18:31.071 --> 00:18:33.071
bound just bound, without understanding.

00:18:34.354 --> 00:18:37.067
But He wants your complete liberation.

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:40.853
So the first stage is that you have to choose your liberation

00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:43.734
through your own freedom of choice.

00:18:45.138 --> 00:18:48.147
Now, up to this point, till you were human beings,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.350
there was no choice for you,

00:18:52.593 --> 00:18:54.593
but after becoming a human being

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:57.813
you were given the choice because you could develop well

00:18:58.856 --> 00:19:02.342
to understand what is right and wrong in your own freedom,

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:06.516
so that you can enter into the Kingdom of God as

00:19:07.016 --> 00:19:08.246
people 

00:19:09.087 --> 00:19:13.195
who are free and have chosen good in their own glory

00:19:13.374 --> 00:19:15.374
and in their own freedom.

00:19:18.846 --> 00:19:21.233
This is the only small little step

00:19:22.817 --> 00:19:26.860
where we always confuse our freedom with our ego.

00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:31.828
For example, now,

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.831
this hall is here say, for me to speak.

00:19:37.295 --> 00:19:41.889
Somebody comes from outside who has been sort of

00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:45.033
worked up in some sort of an organization and

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:48.730
he thinks he is doing the greatest work in the whole world in such a myth.

00:19:49.511 --> 00:19:51.954
Comes down here in that ego state,

00:19:52.093 --> 00:19:54.093
sits down here and asks me

00:19:54.232 --> 00:19:57.924
questions after questions, questions after questions, questions after questions,

00:19:58.203 --> 00:20:00.728
doesn't allow anybody else to speak,

00:20:00.947 --> 00:20:03.228
takes away all my time to himself

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:07.102
as if this hall is booked by him and all the audience is gathered by him.

00:20:08.686 --> 00:20:11.218
He is least bother as to see

00:20:11.517 --> 00:20:14.479
that this is an ego that is working.

00:20:16.706 --> 00:20:18.706
So we should not

00:20:18.865 --> 00:20:21.334
confuse our freedom with ego,

00:20:21.754 --> 00:20:23.754
that's what I have to give you a counsel.

00:20:24.437 --> 00:20:30.512
Try to differentiate your ego from your freedom.

00:20:31.173 --> 00:20:34.699
When you are ego bound, you are a slave of your ego.

00:20:36.042 --> 00:20:37.860
When you are super ego bound,

00:20:37.918 --> 00:20:40.300
you are slave of your super ego,

00:20:40.659 --> 00:20:41.833
of your conditioning.

00:20:41.871 --> 00:20:43.871
For example, you are born a Christian, you are a Christian

00:20:43.949 --> 00:20:45.527
you are bound forever then.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.580
All right, you are a Christian but what about real Christianity within you.

00:20:50.601 --> 00:20:53.080
What about your rebirth in the real sense of the word.

00:20:56.954 --> 00:21:00.462
So you become enslaved to these things, so there is no freedom.

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:02.962
And Spirit is

00:21:03.121 --> 00:21:05.845
the freedom, is the free.

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:08.345
Being within us.

00:21:08.845 --> 00:21:10.845
It is detached.

00:21:10.883 --> 00:21:12.883
It cannot be killed.

00:21:13.383 --> 00:21:15.383
It cannot be blown away.

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:17.602
It cannot be burnt away.

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:22.168
It is eternal. Anand. It is eternal.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.466
That Spirit is joy.

00:21:28.468 --> 00:21:31.137
That Spirit is the source of joy.

00:21:32.962 --> 00:21:34.850
That emits joy.

00:21:35.792 --> 00:21:40.595
Joy is different from happiness and unhappiness.

00:21:41.236 --> 00:21:44.537
Ego, when it feels pampered, it feels happy.

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:47.405
I like it, I like it.

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:49.905
This "I" business

00:21:51.469 --> 00:21:53.891
is ego pampering

00:21:54.297 --> 00:21:57.738
that is no joy. Because you like to drink today

00:21:57.801 --> 00:22:00.796
and tomorrow you don't like to have a headache.

00:22:01.749 --> 00:22:04.620
It has the double side of I like and I don't like.

00:22:06.699 --> 00:22:13.024
You like something through your ego, dislike through your super ego.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.516
So it is a one coin

00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:21.208
and there are two faces, one is happiness and another is unhappiness.

00:22:21.317 --> 00:22:25.662
Joy is beyond that. Joy is a drama

00:22:26.162 --> 00:22:31.254
seer, is a witness. You see a drama. You know it's a drama going on.

00:22:31.453 --> 00:22:34.801
You just watch it as a drama. You're not involved

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:36.910
and you are seeing it and enjoying it.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.101
You are crying if you see something, you're

00:22:39.146 --> 00:22:41.524
weeping but you know you are not that, it's a drama.

00:22:42.024 --> 00:22:44.024
Seer, the witness.

00:22:46.326 --> 00:22:48.326
Your Spirit is the witness

00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:50.366
and when you become the Spirit

00:22:50.866 --> 00:22:52.866
you become the witness.

00:22:54.032 --> 00:22:56.866
You become the witness. For example,

00:22:58.133 --> 00:23:01.263
you are seeing something through a window.

00:23:01.763 --> 00:23:04.355
There is something exists in the window for example.

00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:11.198
Now you enter inside the room and you see through the window.

00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:17.121
Your conditioning is like one way arising in you as a thought,

00:23:17.122 --> 00:23:18.753
which comes from the past.

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:22.427
It rises again and another thought comes up and goes

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.540
in the past.

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:27.764
First the past thought is there and

00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:30.264
then another future thought is there it disappears.

00:23:30.764 --> 00:23:34.063
You see the thought rising but you can't see a disappearing of the thought.

00:23:34.563 --> 00:23:36.563
In between that is the present.

00:23:37.274 --> 00:23:40.237
That's the place is established, that present

00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:41.607
is established

00:23:41.781 --> 00:23:45.724
when your attention becomes enlightened by the Spirit.

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:49.110
Either you think of the future or of the past.

00:23:49.955 --> 00:23:53.315
But I say now. At this moment, at the present.

00:23:55.348 --> 00:23:56.940
You cannot stand there

00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:59.440
because your Spirit is not enlightened.

00:24:00.458 --> 00:24:02.458
Because Spirit is the present.

00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:07.217
When you get your Realization,

00:24:07.717 --> 00:24:11.117
you find that you are not thinking

00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:13.714
of the future or the past, you are just enjoying.

00:24:14.214 --> 00:24:16.214
Everything becomes different.

00:24:16.714 --> 00:24:20.452
The whole life becomes a drama

00:24:20.952 --> 00:24:22.952
and the joy out of it starts coming out

00:24:23.452 --> 00:24:26.358
and you really enjoy small, small things here and there

00:24:27.337 --> 00:24:29.736
and you really understand

00:24:30.028 --> 00:24:32.538
how much joy was lost before Realization.

00:24:33.601 --> 00:24:36.109
This is not a mental thing that gives you joy

00:24:37.047 --> 00:24:40.206
but the joy pours on you from your head just like this,

00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:42.360
cool thing starts pouring down.

00:24:43.398 --> 00:24:47.157
As some people have a feeling of a tension rising up,

00:24:47.657 --> 00:24:50.888
it's the same way, a cool sort of thing,

00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:57.273
flow of joy you feel in your whole body pours out.

00:24:57.773 --> 00:25:00.478
Sometimes this cool breeze that rises in the head

00:25:00.978 --> 00:25:05.336
also starts becoming like a fountain pouring down that joy within you.

00:25:05.582 --> 00:25:09.237
You look at the pictures, are examples see this star of Moses.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.300
You David star you see that

00:25:13.383 --> 00:25:16.288
when you see than you can think about it

00:25:16.788 --> 00:25:18.788
or else just watch this.

00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:21.101
Watch it and don't think.

00:25:22.164 --> 00:25:25.340
The joy of the creation of that thing, whole thing,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.840
becomes one with you.

00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:33.596
Like all the creation around a lake

00:25:35.429 --> 00:25:39.226
is completely felt in the lake

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.250
if the lake has no ripples.

00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:45.673
Completely. In the same way, all that is joy,

00:25:46.173 --> 00:25:49.479
the creator, whosoever it may be has put there.

00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:53.169
You get the complete joy within yourself because there is no thought.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.172
There is no barrier. No conditioning.

00:25:57.818 --> 00:25:59.818
The whole thing becomes one with you

00:26:00.318 --> 00:26:02.318
and you start feeling extremely happy.

00:26:03.276 --> 00:26:05.276
Extremely joyous.

00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:11.896
A feeling, which is indescribable.

00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:14.125
It is to be just enjoyed,

00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:17.070
to be felt. Like Kabira was asked,

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.055
"Why don't you speak now?" So he says in Hindi language,

00:26:21.076 --> 00:26:23.076
he is one of the terrific poets we have,

00:26:23.243 --> 00:26:25.949
he says, "Jab mast huye to kya huye.

00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:35.043
When I have gone into the nectar of the intoxication

00:26:35.187 --> 00:26:37.897
of the Spirit, now what can I talk.

00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:41.485
There no word. No cup can fill this joy,

00:26:41.798 --> 00:26:44.181
no words can fill this meaning.

00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:47.706
You better be with me and get it and enjoy yourself."

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:49.379
That's all he could say.

00:26:50.046 --> 00:26:52.046
That's what I say, the narrow vision

00:26:52.546 --> 00:26:55.773
has closed your eyes to so many things.

00:26:55.877 --> 00:26:57.877
Even Christ you cannot understand.

00:26:58.377 --> 00:27:01.914
About Christ it is written in Devi Mahatmya, about Maha Vishnu,

00:27:02.102 --> 00:27:06.194
all His life is written, if you can read it you can find out

00:27:06.257 --> 00:27:09.079
that before coming on this earth you will see

00:27:09.204 --> 00:27:12.380
how He was created, what powers He was given,

00:27:12.651 --> 00:27:15.115
how He is the Son and all that is written.

00:27:15.198 --> 00:27:19.045
But for us, only you think that Bible is the authority.

00:27:20.587 --> 00:27:24.077
It is. But even to understand that Bible,

00:27:24.285 --> 00:27:27.262
as I told you, to understand Gita you better get your Realization.

00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:31.099
In the same way to understand that Bible also

00:27:32.953 --> 00:27:35.749
you have to get your Realization.

00:27:37.999 --> 00:27:41.187
The One about Whom

00:27:41.687 --> 00:27:44.664
it is described had never been to a school.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.810
None of them have been to any school.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.311
For the first time in this life I have learnt this English language.

00:27:53.499 --> 00:27:56.617
I never knew this language in any one of my lives before.

00:27:57.638 --> 00:27:59.638
Because I knew I have to talk to you.

00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:04.233
And I have to tell you about Spirit in this language.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.827
But to understand it we have to read ancient scriptures.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.110
Beautiful ancient scripture are there

00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.531
which describes the nature of the Spirit.

00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:23.784
It is said that Spirit has got three qualities. Satchitananda -

00:28:24.284 --> 00:28:27.645
Sat, chit, Ananda. Sat means truth,

00:28:28.145 --> 00:28:30.145
chit means attention.

00:28:30.645 --> 00:28:32.210
Anand means joy.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.073
Sat is the truth. What is the truth now?

00:28:38.323 --> 00:28:41.929
If you see something white it is the truth, all right.

00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:44.429
But what is the truth of this shawl.

00:28:44.554 --> 00:28:46.554
A realized soul can know

00:28:47.054 --> 00:28:51.357
not you because his Spirit is enlightened.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.879
He sees the fifth dimension of this shawl.

00:28:55.379 --> 00:28:59.208
Let him hold it in his hands and he will know that this is Mother's shawl.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.671
Immediately he'll feel those cool vibrations coming out of it.

00:29:03.963 --> 00:29:05.963
He'll know that this is Mother's shawl.

00:29:06.671 --> 00:29:07.867
That is the truth.

00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:11.478
The four dimensions, which we know of,

00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:17.850
is not the truth but the fifth one which is the truth, which is the Spirit.

00:29:19.183 --> 00:29:22.204
Sitting down here you can find out anybody

00:29:22.704 --> 00:29:25.385
what is he suffering from what are his problems,

00:29:25.573 --> 00:29:27.573
what are his chakras, it is absolute.

00:29:28.073 --> 00:29:30.695
This knowledge is absolute.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.757
If you have five or ten children who are realized

00:29:35.195 --> 00:29:38.386
and if you tied her eyes

00:29:38.886 --> 00:29:41.340
and ask them about a patient,

00:29:41.382 --> 00:29:44.551
which is he suffering from, they will all raise their fingers

00:29:44.634 --> 00:29:46.634
this or this or this

00:29:47.134 --> 00:29:49.868
or all of them,

00:29:50.139 --> 00:29:51.395
whatever maybe the case.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.166
All of them will raise the same fingers

00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:56.958
it is absolute knowledge.

00:29:58.479 --> 00:30:00.479
It cannot be argued.

00:30:01.312 --> 00:30:03.312
It cannot be refuted.

00:30:03.812 --> 00:30:05.812
It is what it is.

00:30:06.312 --> 00:30:10.791
And also today the man may be having these

00:30:11.062 --> 00:30:13.397
problems tomorrow he may not have at all.

00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:16.876
So then whatever was there is finished

00:30:16.959 --> 00:30:19.334
whatever is today that's what they are going to tell you,

00:30:20.917 --> 00:30:24.808
so this is the truth. The rest is all

00:30:26.996 --> 00:30:30.233
is mithya, is false.

00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:36.727
I was once going in Kashmir

00:30:37.935 --> 00:30:41.638
driving through some very remote corner

00:30:42.638 --> 00:30:46.188
and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations in the air

00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:48.999
and I asked the driver

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.834
"Is there any temple here or something?"

00:30:50.897 --> 00:30:55.425
because in Kashmir there are many temples which are vibrating.

00:30:56.863 --> 00:30:59.474
So many things have come out of the Mother Earth,

00:30:59.537 --> 00:31:01.537
as it said in the Ten Commandment

00:31:02.037 --> 00:31:03.938
that "Thou shalt not worship

00:31:03.959 --> 00:31:06.626
anything that is created by the Mother Earth,

00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:11.596
reproduced and worshipped."

00:31:12.096 --> 00:31:14.864
There are many in Kashmir like that.

00:31:15.364 --> 00:31:17.783
So, I asked him and he said "No there is no temple,

00:31:17.804 --> 00:31:19.804
there are no Hindus live in this area.

00:31:20.304 --> 00:31:22.701
I said but still I feel tremendous vibration

00:31:22.826 --> 00:31:25.670
so my husband told driver "All right, let's go the way she says."

00:31:26.087 --> 00:31:28.087
So, we followed about three miles

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.161
and we reached a colony of people

00:31:31.307 --> 00:31:33.099
who were Muslims living there.

00:31:33.184 --> 00:31:35.750
When we asked, "Is there any temple here?",

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.877
he said, "No, but there is one great mosque."

00:31:41.106 --> 00:31:44.103
"What mosque is that?" called as "Hazrat Iqbal."

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.072
That means one hair of Hazrat Mohammad Sahib

00:31:50.218 --> 00:31:52.648
of Mohammad Sahib one hair was there.

00:31:54.231 --> 00:31:58.141
And even now to take His name, the vibrations start flowing.

00:31:58.245 --> 00:32:00.245
How can I deny Him?

00:32:02.099 --> 00:32:03.538
He was the truth.

00:32:04.476 --> 00:32:08.218
Spirit will not deny. It is the falsehood that denies

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.786
all these real people.

00:32:10.286 --> 00:32:12.910
It is the Spirit, that

00:32:13.016 --> 00:32:16.272
gives you the truth, which integrates all that is truth

00:32:17.376 --> 00:32:20.436
and throws away that is untruth.

00:32:21.499 --> 00:32:23.730
That's why you must get your Spirit.

00:32:24.418 --> 00:32:27.926
Before that anybody talks to you about God,

00:32:28.259 --> 00:32:31.189
about anything they can even crucify.

00:32:31.502 --> 00:32:34.310
They are such stupid foolish people

00:32:34.998 --> 00:32:37.850
that they can do anything. They'll argue with you they'll

00:32:37.913 --> 00:32:41.075
fight with you, they'll do all kinds of stupid things but

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.950
understand you.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.450
This is what my father told me

00:32:46.825 --> 00:32:49.725
that you have to find out an en masse method,

00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:53.436
method by which you give Realization to many people

00:32:54.144 --> 00:32:57.398
so that they can see that there is something beyond.

00:32:57.898 --> 00:32:59.898
They are all standing on the first floor

00:33:00.398 --> 00:33:02.398
if you are born on the tenth floor

00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:06.094
and you tell them something that you see on the tenth floor,

00:33:06.594 --> 00:33:09.123
they're not going to believe you, they will fight with you, they'll

00:33:09.165 --> 00:33:11.165
quarrel with you, they'll pull you down

00:33:11.186 --> 00:33:13.186
because their ego is challenged all the time.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.540
So best thing is to transform them,

00:33:17.373 --> 00:33:19.373
give them en masse Realization.

00:33:20.644 --> 00:33:22.644
That is what is the Spirit is

00:33:22.936 --> 00:33:26.546
that every one of you have got Spirit

00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:33.420
but it was very difficult in those days to give en masse realization,

00:33:34.753 --> 00:33:36.753
the blossom time had not come.

00:33:37.253 --> 00:33:39.421
Today the blossoms time has come. 

00:33:40.067 --> 00:33:43.153
And the wind that blows the cool wind

00:33:43.403 --> 00:33:46.199
gives Realization to so many of them.

00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:50.190
Thousands of people have got Realization,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.393
you also many of you have got your Realization.

00:33:53.997 --> 00:33:56.713
So this Spirit is established, you feel

00:33:57.213 --> 00:33:58.756
you are something different now.

00:33:59.256 --> 00:34:01.850
The transformation has started, the baptism has

00:34:01.871 --> 00:34:03.871
been done in the actual sense.

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:07.849
and you start feeling its moving, you feel the cool breeze.

00:34:09.495 --> 00:34:13.816
Now, when you take to your collective being, you become

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.920
one with the others also.

00:34:16.795 --> 00:34:18.268
You try to give.

00:34:18.414 --> 00:34:22.008
Now you are taking from me when I go, you stand here and give.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.389
When the light, the lamp is not enlightened,

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:29.889
then all right try to enlighten it.

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.089
After enlightenment what does the light do, is to give the light.

00:34:34.964 --> 00:34:37.360
Spirit gives you, your meaning.

00:34:39.402 --> 00:34:44.415
Spirit gives you your understanding

00:34:44.748 --> 00:34:49.187
of the truth that is reality not unreal things,

00:34:50.416 --> 00:34:53.969
me you cannot understand if you are not Realized you cannot

00:34:55.073 --> 00:34:58.497
I'm just like you, there is no difference.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.938
But those who are Realized know about me very well.

00:35:04.438 --> 00:35:06.249
Even living in Ramuln.

00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:09.942
A saint who met one of the Sahaja yoginis, she was American,

00:35:10.984 --> 00:35:12.984
and he just bowed to her

00:35:13.484 --> 00:35:17.146
and made her sit higher than him and said, you have met Mother.

00:35:17.292 --> 00:35:19.514
I have not yet met Her. And she was surprised

00:35:20.014 --> 00:35:22.014
that how did you know all these things.

00:35:22.514 --> 00:35:24.514
There are so many saints in India

00:35:25.014 --> 00:35:28.095
who are real saints, who know about me.

00:35:28.595 --> 00:35:31.103
But those who are very close to me also,

00:35:31.645 --> 00:35:34.921
because you know my husband is highly placed in life

00:35:35.254 --> 00:35:37.729
and we have friends of very elite and very...

00:35:37.938 --> 00:35:40.187
I have seen all prime ministers of the world,

00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.443
I've met them and I've met all sorts of kings and queens

00:35:43.463 --> 00:35:46.374
and this and that and every day I am shaking hands with them.

00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:52.066
They don't know me, they don't recognize me.

00:35:52.352 --> 00:35:54.449
There was a gentleman who we knew very well

00:35:54.464 --> 00:35:58.993
he is now the President of the High Court,

00:36:00.484 --> 00:36:01.642
World High Court

00:36:03.521 --> 00:36:06.161
and, I mean, we knew him very well

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.987
a great friend of my husband's and all that,

00:36:08.273 --> 00:36:11.282
and suddenly he saw, his wife saw my photograph with

00:36:11.588 --> 00:36:13.057
one of the Maharajas

00:36:13.091 --> 00:36:15.091
place one of the Maharajas having in his pocket.

00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:19.299
So the Maharaja suddenly took it out the photograph and put it

00:36:19.293 --> 00:36:21.799
to his eyes and put it back. So she said what is this?

00:36:22.085 --> 00:36:24.085
Such and such lady, I know her very well.

00:36:24.138 --> 00:36:26.138
He said yes, but don't you know she is

00:36:26.209 --> 00:36:28.638
the Mataji, who has cured me of my heart trouble.

00:36:29.255 --> 00:36:31.837
She said, really? I didn't know she was a Mataji or anything.

00:36:32.337 --> 00:36:34.337
She comes to the party, she's very quiet.

00:36:34.837 --> 00:36:36.354
She just sits quietly.

00:36:36.369 --> 00:36:38.369
I never even heard her speaking.

00:36:38.617 --> 00:36:41.744
For the last 25 years I know, she speaks very little.

00:36:42.127 --> 00:36:45.701
Oh God, she gives lectures and there are thousands of people.

00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:47.178
Can she speak?

00:36:47.523 --> 00:36:48.843
She was surprised.

00:36:49.343 --> 00:36:51.788
We have never seen her speaking anything.

00:36:52.288 --> 00:36:54.748
I won't even be able to recognize her voice even 

00:36:54.782 --> 00:36:58.180
my husband of course speaks a lot and her husband speaks

00:36:58.175 --> 00:37:01.129
a lot, I also speak but I have never heard her speaking anything,

00:37:01.182 --> 00:37:04.419
she just keeps quiet, sometimes amusing to herself.

00:37:04.867 --> 00:37:07.488
She seems to be a dignified lady but otherwise

00:37:07.522 --> 00:37:11.385
she never makes any efforts to impress us or anyway tell us that she is Mataji.

00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:19.287
Immediately the husband got such a shock

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.262
and he immediately telephoned to my husband,

00:37:21.277 --> 00:37:23.938
I never knew she was Mataji. It was such a thing.

00:37:23.972 --> 00:37:26.605
You knew I am a seeker, I'm a seeker, a seeker.

00:37:26.697 --> 00:37:29.843
And he said that. So my husband said she's now in Delhi, go and meet her.

00:37:30.343 --> 00:37:32.343
Immediately he sent for me.

00:37:32.532 --> 00:37:35.739
and he got his realization in five minutes,

00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:38.650
but his wife didn't get it. So he sent her back.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:43.063
He sent her by plane, that you better get it.

00:37:43.097 --> 00:37:44.745
This is the thing one has to get.

00:37:46.565 --> 00:37:48.565
Now the emphasis

00:37:49.453 --> 00:37:51.453
that you have to be your Spirit

00:37:52.264 --> 00:37:54.264
is very much reduced

00:37:54.473 --> 00:37:55.696
in the modern society.

00:37:59.633 --> 00:38:02.355
Emphasis should be that your Spirit

00:38:02.855 --> 00:38:04.855
is to be achieved in this life time.

00:38:06.073 --> 00:38:08.421
This is what one has to do, is the

00:38:08.688 --> 00:38:10.688
only thing one have to do,

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:13.188
that is not there in the western societies.

00:38:14.096 --> 00:38:17.392
Secondly for this you have to control your attention,

00:38:17.387 --> 00:38:19.387
don't allow your attention to spill out.

00:38:21.635 --> 00:38:23.561
I hope I told you the story of

00:38:23.731 --> 00:38:26.659
Janaka did I tell them I do not know but I'll again repeat

00:38:27.897 --> 00:38:31.146
Like there was a Raja Janaka, the father of Sita

00:38:31.199 --> 00:38:33.199
father-in-law of Rama.

00:38:35.077 --> 00:38:36.650
And Narada went to him,

00:38:36.684 --> 00:38:39.808
another celestial being, he went to see him and he said,

00:38:40.386 --> 00:38:43.159
"How is it, you are a king and you move about

00:38:43.236 --> 00:38:45.659
like a king, you have everything like a king,

00:38:45.674 --> 00:38:47.674
you have gold and everything

00:38:47.727 --> 00:38:51.096
and how is it people say that you are [unclear]

00:38:51.188 --> 00:38:53.188
above all these things, above your body?

00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:54.367
How is it?"

00:38:55.255 --> 00:38:57.255
He said, "All right, I will tell you in the evening,

00:38:57.347 --> 00:38:58.694
but just now you do me a job.

00:38:58.825 --> 00:39:01.838
You carry some milk in this pot."

00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:03.514
The pot had no rim also.

00:39:03.878 --> 00:39:06.680
So poor fellow was carrying that.

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:09.879
The whole day he was carrying got tired.

00:39:09.952 --> 00:39:12.438
He said don't allow even a drop to spill out.

00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:14.064
He was looking at it all the time.

00:39:14.564 --> 00:39:15.650
In the evening he got tired

00:39:15.684 --> 00:39:18.094
and put it there and he said, "Now will you tell me,

00:39:18.594 --> 00:39:20.107
I've had enough of this."

00:39:20.393 --> 00:39:22.393
He said, "What did you see when you were moving about?"

00:39:23.068 --> 00:39:25.696
He said, "Nothing, what could I see? I was just watching

00:39:26.992 --> 00:39:28.992
this milk that it should not spill out."

00:39:30.327 --> 00:39:32.327
He said, "In the same way

00:39:33.118 --> 00:39:36.761
I am at that stage where my attention does not spill out."

00:39:37.494 --> 00:39:39.689
That is the state you are achieving

00:39:39.975 --> 00:39:41.312
your Self-Realization,

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:45.883
where the attention is completely enlightened by your Spirit.

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:49.093
It doesn't envelope anything like that

00:39:49.154 --> 00:39:51.933
and even if it goes round it comes back as it is.

00:39:52.143 --> 00:39:56.386
My hand when it touches it, it doesn't become this metal, does it?

00:39:56.886 --> 00:39:58.886
It comes out.

00:39:59.702 --> 00:40:03.673
It's absolutely detached from this. I can touch it but I am not that.

00:40:04.436 --> 00:40:07.676
Just now I am matter. I am everything,

00:40:07.702 --> 00:40:10.180
I am worried about my children my house this thing,

00:40:10.338 --> 00:40:12.338
but when I become realized

00:40:12.838 --> 00:40:14.838
I get completely detached.

00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:18.681
I am a spiritual living being.

00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:22.747
Then nothing

00:40:23.906 --> 00:40:27.184
can keep you down, nothing can dominate you.

00:40:27.394 --> 00:40:30.025
And you do not dominate anything.

00:40:31.974 --> 00:40:37.526
That is the state of the Spirit. When that happens

00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:44.866
you become beyond dharma sustenance, you are beyond it.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.870
For example there is no temptation for such a person.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.370
There's no temptation.

00:40:56.186 --> 00:40:58.186
There is no mental activity either

00:41:00.354 --> 00:41:04.704
there is no stealing nor telling lies. Such a person is extremely

00:41:04.756 --> 00:41:06.090
honest and fearless,

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.163
like Christ. He had nothing to do with the prostitute.

00:41:09.953 --> 00:41:12.645
I mean she was a different style, He was a different style.

00:41:13.514 --> 00:41:15.579
But when people started stoning the prostitute

00:41:15.628 --> 00:41:17.252
He stood up before them and asked,

00:41:17.358 --> 00:41:19.447
who are the ones who have not committed the sin?

00:41:19.499 --> 00:41:20.778
They could have stoned Him.

00:41:20.936 --> 00:41:23.854
This His honesty and His strength stopped it.

00:41:25.513 --> 00:41:28.266
They will stand by all those who are tortured

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.676
and troubled by people who are oppressive.

00:41:32.071 --> 00:41:34.543
They are not afraid of anything. They are fearless people.

00:41:35.043 --> 00:41:38.077
Neither they frighten anyone. They are compassionate.

00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:40.287
But when it comes to protesting

00:41:40.418 --> 00:41:45.033
they stand up fearlessly against those

00:41:45.138 --> 00:41:48.533
who try to torture and ruin others.

00:41:49.823 --> 00:41:53.469
There is no oppression. Even

00:41:54.364 --> 00:41:56.959
I cannot force you to get Realization.

00:41:58.091 --> 00:42:01.246
I cannot argue it out with you. It has to work out.

00:42:01.562 --> 00:42:03.562
It is as simple as that.

00:42:03.641 --> 00:42:07.548
If you do not want it, you can never get it.

00:42:07.653 --> 00:42:09.090
Out of question.

00:42:09.221 --> 00:42:12.578
So there is [unclear] as I say, if you do not want it, you better go away

00:42:12.683 --> 00:42:16.647
But still some obstinate people will sit there. No, I'll sit here. For what?

00:42:18.649 --> 00:42:22.025
Such people also give out very bad vibrations to others

00:42:22.525 --> 00:42:25.924
and they disturb others getting their Realization, it is satanic.

00:42:28.426 --> 00:42:31.065
Still I make them sit all right sit down.

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:34.619
You cannot force it.

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:37.119
It's a light within you a flicker.

00:42:38.296 --> 00:42:42.738
And the analogy could be, like the gas.

00:42:43.785 --> 00:42:48.517
That rises and touches the flicker and the whole gas gets enlightened.

00:42:50.475 --> 00:42:53.784
The flicker is awake all the time and watching.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.690
Then the whole thing becomes the truth.

00:42:59.622 --> 00:43:03.423
Truth is very different from what we know as truth.

00:43:05.459 --> 00:43:08.442
Is a new dimension, by which we know

00:43:08.682 --> 00:43:11.649
this is the truth and this is not the truth.

00:43:12.149 --> 00:43:15.259
You can ask any questions when you are

00:43:17.894 --> 00:43:21.008
connected with your Spirit. Ask any question.

00:43:21.143 --> 00:43:22.668
Ask the question about me.

00:43:23.533 --> 00:43:25.533
Then ask the question about Christ,

00:43:26.033 --> 00:43:30.236
about Moses, about God. Ask any question.

00:43:31.335 --> 00:43:34.613
And when the answer is yes, you will get cool breeze coming into you.

00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:37.113
If you aks any negative questions,

00:43:37.613 --> 00:43:41.533
you lose your vibrations. Might get tingling, might get heat.

00:43:43.908 --> 00:43:47.513
Because now your computer is connected with

00:43:48.534 --> 00:43:51.887
the absolute and the rapport has been established of the truth.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.743
This is a new awareness you get by which

00:43:57.519 --> 00:43:59.781
you become aware

00:44:01.974 --> 00:44:05.837
of truth which is the vibratory awareness.

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.552
Through vibrations a child also can know.

00:44:10.687 --> 00:44:12.687
There are many children who are born realized.

00:44:13.786 --> 00:44:15.786
And they know where is the Kundalini.

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:19.508
They know. They will tell you where is the Kundalini.

00:44:20.008 --> 00:44:21.231
It's the truth.

00:44:21.861 --> 00:44:24.741
Because they know the truth. For that you don't need

00:44:24.746 --> 00:44:27.321
too much of mental development.

00:44:30.477 --> 00:44:32.477
They are very dignified.

00:44:33.654 --> 00:44:37.667
They understand it better than many elderly people and

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:41.290
people who are placed very highly in life.

00:44:41.425 --> 00:44:43.063
Christ has already said

00:44:43.172 --> 00:44:47.348
that rich men are not going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:44:48.134 --> 00:44:49.980
He has already said because they are running.

00:44:50.037 --> 00:44:52.806
But I would say even those who think they know a lot,

00:44:53.176 --> 00:44:55.176
all knowing, they will not enter.

00:44:59.999 --> 00:45:01.999
Because they do not want to enter.

00:45:02.082 --> 00:45:05.623
They know everything. They do not want to enter inside.

00:45:06.566 --> 00:45:10.935
They want to carry their mind everywhere.

00:45:12.398 --> 00:45:15.105
They want to carry their car inside the hall.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.230
How they will enter inside?

00:45:18.964 --> 00:45:22.757
They are not willing to keep their mind outside

00:45:23.257 --> 00:45:26.128
because they are always dependent on that mind

00:45:26.342 --> 00:45:28.342
which has given them nothing.

00:45:28.842 --> 00:45:35.689
But to achieve Spirit you have to come there ego-lessly, to receive.

00:45:36.189 --> 00:45:39.012
The light of your being

00:45:39.512 --> 00:45:43.301
is going to enlighten the whole thing. Your temple.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.270
And when this light comes in,

00:45:47.812 --> 00:45:49.812
when this line shines in you,

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:55.722
then you can feel your collective consciousness, you can feel it,

00:45:55.779 --> 00:45:58.854
the cool breeze of the Spirit manifesting through you,

00:46:00.708 --> 00:46:04.949
is described in the Bible in very short but deep.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.889
But, Adi Shankaracharya has written such a big book,

00:46:10.159 --> 00:46:12.389
one is called as Saundarya Lahiri

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.787
or Chaitanya Lahiri.

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:20.922
It is not easy to talk about all these in such a short time.

00:46:23.818 --> 00:46:27.741
He wrote treaties of philosophy.

00:46:28.241 --> 00:46:30.241
Great personality he was

00:46:31.965 --> 00:46:35.216
called as Vivekachudamani. First of all he gave

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:39.481
conscious the call. Where is your conscience? Vivekachudamani.

00:46:39.981 --> 00:46:43.761
Then he wrote many books and

00:46:43.896 --> 00:46:47.092
ultimately he wrote Saundarya Lahiri.

00:46:48.165 --> 00:46:51.316
In that he says it's only the description of the beauty

00:46:51.372 --> 00:46:53.372
of my Mother I can describe

00:46:53.664 --> 00:46:56.711
and in all details he has described nothing but The Mother.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.555
Her fingers, Her hands, Her movements and

00:46:59.612 --> 00:47:02.841
everything and what he saw how the vibrations move in Her,

00:47:03.002 --> 00:47:06.061
every words that She speaks.

00:47:07.498 --> 00:47:10.797
You have to read that book to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:12.755 --> 00:47:14.755
It's very clearly given all these things.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.329
As I told you the other day, William Blake also has written about Sahaja Yoga

00:47:19.386 --> 00:47:21.386
very clearly.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.596
But unless and until you have Realization

00:47:24.966 --> 00:47:29.785
you cannot know the truth. So He's the truth, "Sat".

00:47:30.285 --> 00:47:34.225
Then is "Chit" is attention, He's the attention.

00:47:34.308 --> 00:47:36.308
Your Spirit is the attention.

00:47:37.094 --> 00:47:39.094
Attention of God.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.531
God is attentive to you through your Spirit

00:47:43.719 --> 00:47:46.548
and when your attention is enlightened by Him

00:47:46.553 --> 00:47:48.739
that means you've come in the attention of God.

00:47:50.359 --> 00:47:54.310
You are looked after by God. All His powers flow into you.

00:47:55.227 --> 00:47:57.227
All His protection comes to you.

00:47:57.493 --> 00:48:00.345
You will be amazed there will here Sahaja yogis will tell you.

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.845
How they avoided accidents,

00:48:03.345 --> 00:48:05.345
what happened after accidents

00:48:05.845 --> 00:48:08.720
and miraculously how people are saved.

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:14.111
It is nothing new to me. It is the minimum that can happen to a person.

00:48:16.173 --> 00:48:18.173
This is the minimum of minimum,

00:48:18.673 --> 00:48:21.666
because all the angels they take charge.

00:48:21.775 --> 00:48:25.881
You are on the stage, the angels are there to look after you.

00:48:26.251 --> 00:48:30.440
And you really start gradually feeling the presence of that blessing

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.940
which is the attention of God.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.171
So He's the "Chit". " Sat", "Chit" and "Anand" He is the joy.

00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:39.671
He is the joy.

00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:45.296
Because God is joy.

00:48:46.317 --> 00:48:48.317
He created this universe

00:48:48.817 --> 00:48:51.649
not to make us serious and unhappy and sulky.

00:48:53.763 --> 00:48:56.313
See how many flowers, how many beautiful things,

00:48:56.318 --> 00:48:59.647
how many colors what He has created for us.

00:48:59.756 --> 00:49:04.023
For us to enjoy He has created all this not to indulge into nonsense,

00:49:04.523 --> 00:49:06.523
into filth, into dirt,

00:49:10.226 --> 00:49:12.226
the dirt of the mind, the sin

00:49:13.169 --> 00:49:15.169
the filthy ideas.

00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:21.367
But to have a clean heart

00:49:22.075 --> 00:49:25.362
and to have a clean morality within us.

00:49:28.987 --> 00:49:32.485
He has created this beautiful world for us to enjoy

00:49:32.516 --> 00:49:35.619
without that you cannot enjoy, you cannot enjoy

00:49:36.405 --> 00:49:39.382
unless and until you have a clean morality within you,

00:49:39.465 --> 00:49:41.465
you cannot enjoy yourself.

00:49:44.074 --> 00:49:46.074
And that joy is your own

00:49:46.574 --> 00:49:48.574
once you get your Realization.

00:49:50.402 --> 00:49:54.216
This joy is the compassion and grace of God.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.560
When the Kundalini first rises

00:49:57.503 --> 00:49:59.503
through one small little thread,

00:50:00.003 --> 00:50:02.003
She touches the Brahmarandra here,

00:50:03.258 --> 00:50:05.258
just one thread.

00:50:05.341 --> 00:50:08.006
She opens and the grace and joy.

00:50:08.506 --> 00:50:10.506
Because here is the seat

00:50:11.006 --> 00:50:15.234
of Sadashiva, here is the seat of your Spirit.

00:50:15.734 --> 00:50:20.413
When it touches the Spirit, that seat, the flow

00:50:20.444 --> 00:50:22.080
of the grace starts coming

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.058
on your sympathetic nervous system and you feel relaxed.

00:50:25.115 --> 00:50:27.115
First thing happens to you you feel relaxed.

00:50:27.355 --> 00:50:30.626
Is the grace. Only one thread has reached

00:50:32.142 --> 00:50:36.736
and then the flow that is flowing today this one is the Brahma

00:50:38.798 --> 00:50:42.424
is the power of God flowing through you.

00:50:45.762 --> 00:50:47.262
This is what you have to get.

00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:52.225
This is what you've to remember, somebody touched Christ and the power went.

00:50:55.303 --> 00:50:57.303
For us

00:50:58.584 --> 00:51:03.143
it is necessary to know that we are the first Australians to get Realization.

00:51:04.245 --> 00:51:06.398
You are the first people to get it.

00:51:07.263 --> 00:51:10.121
And it's a great responsibility on you,

00:51:10.256 --> 00:51:14.177
all of you who have got Realization today and before,

00:51:15.198 --> 00:51:16.752
to keep it strong.

00:51:16.835 --> 00:51:20.223
Make it into a tree, because you are responsible for

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.266
all the progeny that is going to come to this

00:51:23.297 --> 00:51:26.599
beautiful land of yours by which you are blessed.

00:51:28.974 --> 00:51:32.605
So this is the beautiful place

00:51:32.845 --> 00:51:36.037
and beautiful people. So many children of mine.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.321
Today is the last day. 

00:51:40.696 --> 00:51:45.716
It's a very sad thing that one has to say good-bye.

00:51:46.424 --> 00:51:50.524
I hope you all will make it convenient to come and see me on Sunday.

00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.816
I'll be looking forward to you.

00:51:53.134 --> 00:51:55.587
Here I will try to cure you also

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.982
if you have any problems, but don't bring all the hospitals there.

00:52:01.357 --> 00:52:05.537
I will teach you how to cure and how to give realization.

00:52:06.037 --> 00:52:09.306
Best thing is you bring the case to me and I will tell you how to

00:52:09.389 --> 00:52:12.663
cure yourself because if you are realized souls, you can cure also.

00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:15.371
We always in India do,

00:52:15.428 --> 00:52:17.428
when a cancer patient comes in, we call

00:52:17.459 --> 00:52:21.750
one of his relations, give him Realization, teach him how to cure cancer

00:52:21.833 --> 00:52:23.833
and he looks after the patient.

00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:27.676
Because that's the best way one can do it.

00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:29.758
He can give Realization,

00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:32.319
to that person he can look after better,

00:52:32.402 --> 00:52:33.959
he knows the person better

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.149
and it works out much better that way.

00:52:38.352 --> 00:52:41.281
So I hope you'll make it convenient to come and see me.

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.981
I must say, I was very much impressed by Sydney people

00:52:45.481 --> 00:52:50.336
who have been so kind to come here and listen and get their Realization.

00:52:50.966 --> 00:52:52.966
I have to say that

00:52:53.466 --> 00:52:55.466
because I am a mother.

00:52:56.226 --> 00:52:58.746
I cannot just leave it to your senses.

00:52:59.246 --> 00:53:01.819
I have to ask, I have to request you.

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:06.217
I have to be very, very patient with you, extremely patient

00:53:06.847 --> 00:53:09.719
and loving so that you listen to me

00:53:09.959 --> 00:53:12.651
and take your Realization. I have to actually

00:53:12.708 --> 00:53:14.708
go to you to do that.

00:53:14.739 --> 00:53:18.024
It's all right, that is mother's job, only mother can do it.

00:53:18.107 --> 00:53:20.107
When Christ will come, He will take His

00:53:21.362 --> 00:53:23.784
eleven powers and He will just sort you out.

00:53:23.945 --> 00:53:28.400
Before that please have yourself completely judged

00:53:28.483 --> 00:53:31.701
through your own Kundalini awakening and work it out.

00:53:32.565 --> 00:53:35.425
Those people who have came with ideas

00:53:35.482 --> 00:53:36.622
of their own should

00:53:36.653 --> 00:53:40.311
just go and see for themselves what they have achieved by these

00:53:41.462 --> 00:53:42.664
ideas.

00:53:42.695 --> 00:53:46.109
There have been so many organizations, one after another.

00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:49.397
There is no way to organize God.

00:53:49.611 --> 00:53:51.611
Better organize yourself

00:53:51.746 --> 00:53:54.480
through your Spirit, which is the absolute.

00:53:56.178 --> 00:53:58.217
May God Bless You!
