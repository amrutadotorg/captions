00:00:08.078 --> 00:00:14.358
Today we have gathered here

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:20.611
to worship Shri Krishna.

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.971
We must understand the significance

00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:29.091
of Shri Krishna's advent

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:32.851
on the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:41.731
As you know very well, except for once or twice,

00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:57.451
Shri Brahmadeva has taken his incarnation.

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:06.211
Also once Shri Ganesha has taken His birth

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:09.611
as Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:14.291
But Vishnu Tattwa, the principle of Vishnu,

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:19.611
has taken many a times birth on this earth,

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:24.131
as the Goddess had to take many a times Her birth.

00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:29.691
They had to work together many a times,

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:38.051
and with the principle of Vishnu,

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:41.651
the principle of Mahalakshmi has acted

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.051
to help the ascent of the people.

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:54.531
So the principle of Vishnu is for your ascent,

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:59.131
for the evolutionary process of human beings.

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:04.611
Through this advent

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.771
and through the power of Mahalakshmi,

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:18.451
we have become human beings from amoeba stage.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:26.851
This is a spontaneous working for us

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:31.171
but for the principle of Vishnu,

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:38.891
He had to go through various incarnations to evolve.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:44.851
As you know there have been incarnations

00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.571
of Shri Vishnu as a fish to begin with

00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:58.331
and went on till it came to the state of Shri Krishna,

00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:03.731
where they say that He has become complete.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.491
But one has to realize that

00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:12.291
He works on our central nervous system,

00:03:12.531 --> 00:03:15.931
He builds our central nervous system.

00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:18.331
Through our evolutionary process,

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.771
our central nervous system has been built up,

00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:26.171
and this central nervous system has given us

00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:29.891
all the human awareness that we have;

00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:34.731
otherwise we would have been just like the stones.

00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:38.611
But through this building up of our awareness,

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.371
one after another,

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:44.291
building up different chakras within us,

00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:49.531
this principle of Vishnu has brought us to the understanding

00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:53.251
that we have to seek the truth

00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:58.251
and ultimately we have to become Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.051
So this principle of Shri Krishna

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:05.531
is so important that at the state,

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.811
as you call it the Vishuddhi chakra

00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:11.851
we become complete,

00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:18.571
in the sense that when the Sahasrara is opened out for you

00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:21.811
and you start feeling the vibrations,

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:25.491
you are not yet fully complete.

00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:31.371
If you were just complete then it would have been

00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:39.211
an end of your evolution,

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:44.731
because at that stage, if you had finished it,

00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:47.451
then there was no need to have Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:52.451
But actually it means that once the Sahasrara is opened out,

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:56.011
then you have to come down to your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:04:56.211 --> 00:04:58.811
that means to your collective.

00:04:59.091 --> 00:05:03.691
If it is not working on your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:06.211
the enlightenment on Vishuddhi chakra,

00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.131
you cannot feel the vibrations.

00:05:08.331 --> 00:05:09.931
As you saw yesterday,

00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:14.491
the artists started playing in a very new dimension.

00:05:14.691 --> 00:05:17.971
It's not that only they got awakening of the Kundalini.

00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:21.291
The awakening of the Kundalini was there, no doubt,

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:25.131
but it had to come down to their Vishuddhi chakra.

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.331
If I could not have brought it back to their Vishuddhi chakra,

00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:30.931
their hands could not have moved that fast,

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.851
they would have never felt the sweetness,

00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:36.171
the madhurya of Shri Krishna,

00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:39.251
and they would not have manifested it.

00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:44.971
So all that is expressed through your fingers and hands

00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:50.291
achieves that new awareness of creating the madhurya,

00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:52.091
the sweetness.

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:56.571
In your art, in your music,

00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.731
in your gestures,

00:05:58.931 --> 00:06:02.731
in every way, your hands are very important.

00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:06.131
But Vishuddhi chakra also plays part, as you know,

00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:09.931
on the sixteen chakras or the sub-plexuses

00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.331
which look after our face,

00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.211
our ears, nose, eyes, neck,

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:23.091
all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra.

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:28.451
As a result also, you can become great actors,

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:32.411
you can have eyes which are innocent,

00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.931
you can have a skin which is shining,

00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:40.651
you can have ears which can hear the Divine music,

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:46.851
you can have a nose which shows your dignity.

00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:55.931
In the same way, your whole facial expression changes.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.291
If you are a very harsh person

00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:00.931
and a hot-tempered person

00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.291
and you have harshness on your face,

00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:06.371
or else if you are like a beggar all the time,

00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:08.371
or you are crying all the time, weeping,

00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.451
your face looks so miserable,

00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:13.411
everything changes and comes into the center,

00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:19.371
where you look beautiful, you look attractive,

00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:23.651
in the Divine way, and also you get

00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:30.211
a very sweet countenance.

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.051
Also the teeth and the tongue

00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:36.931
are looked after by the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:43.011
So your teeth which are in trouble get cured.

00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:44.971
You sometimes, as I told you

00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:47.451
I have never been to a dentist all my life.

00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:51.051
So you can imagine that you don't have to go to the dentist any more

00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:54.371
if you have your Vishuddhi chakra all right.

00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:57.611
Then also your tongue improves.

00:07:57.851 --> 00:08:02.171
For example some people are very sarcastic by temperament.

00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:03.811
They cannot say something sweetly,

00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:07.491
all the time they are sarcastic, saying sarcastic things.

00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:11.651
Some people have a habit of abusive language.

00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:18.931
Some people are extremely beggarish type,

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.691
all the time talking in a very beggarish manner.

00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:24.691
There's no dignity, there's no sweetness

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.971
and there is no self-confidence for some people.

00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:29.971
Some people even stammer,

00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:33.371
some people cannot stand on the stage and give a lecture.

00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:35.211
All these things drop out

00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:38.331
as soon as your Vishuddhi chakra improves.

00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:42.771
This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation

00:08:43.051 --> 00:08:46.851
of the Vishuddhi chakra's improvement within yourself,

00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:51.131
through the awakening of Shri Krishna on Vishuddhi chakra.

00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:59.131
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness.

00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:03.331
You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing,

00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:06.691
all that is troubling you, all that is a problem,

00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:10.131
you just start watching it,

00:09:10.371 --> 00:09:14.291
you start witnessing it, you start seeing it,

00:09:14.531 --> 00:09:17.091
and you do not get disturbed.

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.691
That seeing, that witnessing state

00:09:19.931 --> 00:09:22.211
has a tremendous power.

00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:26.171
Whatever you see without thinking,

00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:28.411
your problems get solved.

00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:32.091
Any problem you have, once you get this witness state

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:33.931
- what you call 'tatasth'-

00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:37.451
means you are standing on the shores

00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:40.291
and so watching the waves to move -

00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.091
then you know how to solve the problems.
