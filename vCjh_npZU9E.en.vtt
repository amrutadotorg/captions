WEBVTT

00:02.020 --> 00:06.200
So here we are in Finland and

00:09.740 --> 00:15.060
hell, competing with itself a little bit

00:15.260 --> 00:18.780
because is the end of land, you see, so

00:18.960 --> 00:22.980
all the problems come and settle in the end, you see?

00:23.160 --> 00:29.000
And that’s how we see here that there are lots of negative forces

00:29.200 --> 00:35.480
that have been working very nicely,

00:36.520 --> 00:40.480
and also there are so many seekers.

00:40.660 --> 00:45.760
So, it’s more of an attraction for them to come here and attack the seekers.

00:45.960 --> 00:51.280
So now when you take to Sahaja yoga, you have to know that

00:54.440 --> 00:58.620
Sahaja yoga is like the light coming in your life.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.840
And the light which comes

01:02.020 --> 01:05.440
gradually shows you everything that you have.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.740
For example, you are carrying the snake in your hand.

01:08.940 --> 01:11.820
Somebody says, "Throw away the snake!" you see.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.040
You are in the darkness, you think it's a rope.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.180
So you don't want to throw away the snake.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.540
But the light comes in, you see the snake in your hand,

01:21.680 --> 01:25.400
you get afraid, you throw it away. You get afraid.

01:25.600 --> 01:29.020
And somebody might just run away, thinking that the snake has come

01:29.200 --> 01:32.180
from Sahaja yoga.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.580
So the people who come to Sahaja yoga also

01:37.760 --> 01:41.200
will be like that. They'll come to Sahaja yoga,

01:41.360 --> 01:44.320
and they will be upset about themselves,

01:44.500 --> 01:47.540
“Oh, God, this is my condition,”

01:47.720 --> 01:51.580
And they will not like to face the reality, will run away.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.180
So, you have to be very patient with them and careful.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.360
A little complication piece.

01:58.500 --> 02:03.380
So if somebody is coming to Sahaja yoga, say,

02:03.580 --> 02:08.700
he is coming from complete darkness, from complete ignorance,

02:08.880 --> 02:12.440
you see. Maybe he's already half mad.

02:12.660 --> 02:16.180
You will not know, what his mental condition is.

02:16.420 --> 02:20.500
Maybe he is suffering from some sort of a horrible disease,

02:20.660 --> 02:23.680
could be cancer, could be anything. Because

02:23.860 --> 02:28.280
he would have been to gurus, this, that, there could be anything.

02:28.460 --> 02:32.700
And maybe they are not suffering yet from that.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.880
Or they are suffering so well that they can't heal it.

02:36.080 --> 02:41.020
So it's very complicated. So one should not - first of all -

02:41.200 --> 02:44.560
Know, first principle of Sahaja yoga: "Never get disappointed!"

02:44.740 --> 02:47.280
Never get disappointed!

02:47.460 --> 02:50.440
Sometimes you have to work hard.
I've worked on people

02:50.640 --> 02:53.720
for twenty-four hours and I found they are good for nothing.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.620
Just like stones. If I worked on stones, at least

02:56.800 --> 03:01.160
I would have created the Ganesha out of them.

03:02.460 --> 03:06.200
You find there is nothing, nothing has come out of that, all that

03:06.380 --> 03:11.080
work of puja. So there is nothing to feel frustrated in Sahaja yoga.

03:11.260 --> 03:14.260
It's our... whatever we have to do, we have to do,

03:14.440 --> 03:17.360
we shouldn't worry about the fruits of it.

03:17.540 --> 03:22.240
One of the main principles of Gita is: Karmanye vadhikaraste

03:22.440 --> 03:26.680
Though the karma is there, but not to be thought. [INDIAN LANGUAGE]

03:26.880 --> 03:30.360
Phaleshu ma kadachan (we should not worry about the fruits). And that's what it is.

03:30.540 --> 03:33.580
So that will keep you on the right track.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.740
Otherwise you may get frustrated. And I have known people,

03:36.900 --> 03:39.900
how they have been breaking heads and... So one day I said,

03:40.080 --> 03:45.160
"Why are you so much worried?" See, it happened in Boston. They said

03:45.340 --> 03:49.360
"Mother, do You mean to say, 'All of them are going to go to hell'?"

03:49.540 --> 03:52.920
I said, "I don't say that. But that's hope. [THAT'S GATE?]"

03:53.100 --> 03:56.360
But I would say that at least you should not give up hopes.

03:56.580 --> 03:59.340
Till the end we should try to save them.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.860
And things would work out. And it has started working out there.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.180
In the same way, we have to know that in the beginnig

04:06.340 --> 04:09.320
you never get many sahaja yogis. Never, whatever you may try.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.560
Even in India I started with one sahaja yogi.

04:12.760 --> 04:16.540
Because we have to have a foundation, proper foundation, you have to

04:16.720 --> 04:20.520
have proper. Also, Divine doesn't want us to have too many people.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.700
Because there would be just useless people joining us.

04:23.860 --> 04:27.640
So we have to know that first of all, we have to have solid, good

04:27.820 --> 04:31.180
sahaja yogis. And those who call themselves Sahaja yogis have to build

04:31.360 --> 04:36.900
up themselves in such a manner that they are very good sahaja yogis

04:37.100 --> 04:41.480
and there are no catches, nothing. And their attention is good.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.080
First, once they are established,

04:44.240 --> 04:46.620
then we can build up the whole thing above them.

04:46.780 --> 04:50.540
But otherwise it so happens that if the foundation is weak,

04:50.720 --> 04:53.380
the whole building can go down.

04:53.540 --> 04:58.180
So we have to have few sahaja yogis. We can't afford to have many.

04:58.340 --> 05:02.920
Though you will see when I go - like deflected,

05:03.120 --> 05:06.140
then thousands they will be there.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.660
Everywhere. I mean it's not... Italy I went, Milano...

05:09.820 --> 05:12.840
They have never seen my face, they have never known who I was.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.500
But the all hall was full. I don't know how many thousands people.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.420
And you had to just wade through it.

05:19.620 --> 05:23.860
Everybody was so enthusiastic. I could see the future also.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.320
So we got about ten people out of all that.

05:27.500 --> 05:32.800
Then ten people more, ten more. That's how it started gathering.

05:32.980 --> 05:36.580
Because since Sahaja yoga, you have to become [UNCLEAR].

05:36.760 --> 05:40.260
Becoming is the problem. If you don't become something,

05:40.440 --> 05:43.480
you are no good in the Sahaja yoga.

05:43.660 --> 05:47.240
So, this is a very very big problem, should never get frustrated,

05:47.420 --> 05:51.160
never get upset about it. If anybody says anything to you, after all

05:51.340 --> 05:55.600
he is blind, so doesn't matter. Have pity on him and don't get angry

05:55.760 --> 05:58.740
at him at all. There are maybe some fanatics, somethings, you see,

05:58.920 --> 06:01.880
they are against Sahaja yoga naturally.

06:02.060 --> 06:06.020
Because they are fanatics, they are not wanting reality.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.780
So all such things will happen. You will have to show your patience

06:10.000 --> 06:13.700
and a complete forbearance. That is very important.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.860
Never to get frustrated. Remember what we have.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.040
we should try to perfect it. The more you'll perfect it,

06:20.200 --> 06:23.180
the better it will be for our basic things,

06:23.320 --> 06:26.200
our foundation, which has to be very strong.

06:26.380 --> 06:30.280
And once the foundation is strong, then you can go ahead with it.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.540
But just now to begin with, you should not talk about Me much.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.700
You just say, that, "She is the ordinary human being,

06:36.860 --> 06:39.680
like person the most." If you don't want to tell lies, you can just

06:39.860 --> 06:42.720
say that, "All right, She is all right, we shouldn't discuss that,

06:42.900 --> 06:45.920
let us discuss something else. Let us know about science.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.140
That's better. Then you see, then we know Her", like that, you see.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.900
Just keep it for the further discovery.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.380
If you go on making them understand that it is for their benevolence

06:58.560 --> 07:01.660
or their own energy and their own maneuvering,

07:01.840 --> 07:05.460
they should keep it to themselves, they will be happy.

07:05.660 --> 07:08.600
And not to tell them about Me much.

07:08.780 --> 07:12.060
And the miraculous things of Sahaja yoga should not be described

07:12.260 --> 07:15.640
or talked. Like Heidrich talked to them about the photographs

07:15.820 --> 07:18.580
with these two persons, but they have been doing Sahaja yoga.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.960
But normally, never show them any miraculous photographs.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.640
Because they will always say, "You have managed it and

07:25.820 --> 07:30.220
you try to be with it sort of a... kind of a... maneuvering."

07:30.680 --> 07:34.080
For that I would say that...

07:36.160 --> 07:39.780
[ASIDE:] Smoke is not all right.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.840
So, you should

07:48.840 --> 07:52.800
limit yourself to some things. Like

07:52.980 --> 07:56.940
telling about Sahaja yoga, about Kundalini, about all these things.

07:57.140 --> 08:00.280
But about Me or about miraculous photographs

08:00.420 --> 08:05.100
and all miraculous things you should not talk.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.360
Keep it in a general way.

08:13.540 --> 08:18.640
And also you shouldn't say, "It's a puja," and things like that.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.500
Because very few people can come to puja, you know that.

08:22.680 --> 08:26.800
So everybody need not know about puja, need not know about things.

08:26.980 --> 08:30.380
But what you can tell them is that there are chakras,

08:30.540 --> 08:35.220
they are to be cleaned out and they are to be kept in balance.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.540
And we have to rise the Kundalini, how to rise the Kundalini,

08:38.720 --> 08:41.920
also get advanced. And you say that, "Just now let's use Mother's

08:42.100 --> 08:45.240
photograph for the time being. But later on, we are becoming, we are

08:45.420 --> 08:48.700
free independent guru-beings first, then you don't have to use

08:48.880 --> 08:53.360
Mother´s photographs." Then they'll never give up.

08:58.800 --> 09:04.000
Isn't it? So, all they'll fight for it!

09:07.400 --> 09:10.600
And thirdly, they are afraid of collectivity.

09:10.780 --> 09:15.000
So you have to say that, "Because we are not collective, that's why

09:15.180 --> 09:18.640
we are frightened, and if good people all collect together,

09:18.820 --> 09:22.340
if righteous people..." Like that if you talk, they won't be afraid of.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.560
You see, now, only the thugs combine with,

09:25.740 --> 09:29.900
only the thieves combine. The good people don't combine.

09:30.060 --> 09:34.360
So we have to combine good people. So then they will understand

09:34.520 --> 09:37.580
that part, and they won't be angry. Otherwise,

09:37.760 --> 09:41.660
if you say, "We have to have collectivity", they must be thinking,

09:41.800 --> 09:45.640
"They are up to something." That will be the suspicion. It is always!

09:45.800 --> 09:50.240
Because you'll, you only see that nobody combines for love. If they

09:50.420 --> 09:55.480
combine together, they only combine for what you call, is the fight.

09:55.660 --> 10:00.280
Or the hatred, or could be some sort of a sinister stuff, you see.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.080
Otherwise they never combine. If you say, "We are for love,"

10:04.260 --> 10:09.300
they’ll go away, “Oh, we know this kind. The story we know, this love.”

10:09.480 --> 10:13.540
So if you have to really bring them round through discussion

10:13.700 --> 10:17.600
and argument, you must, first of all, be very good to Sahaja yoga.

10:17.780 --> 10:20.880
That means that, of course the knowledge of Sahaja yoga is too vast,

10:21.060 --> 10:25.340
but you should be in such a mood and such a state and such

10:25.520 --> 10:28.920
a personality, that they should see that there is something special

10:29.080 --> 10:33.700
about this person. And then they will accept you much better.

10:33.880 --> 10:37.540
All right? That's what we have to do and not to get frustrated.

10:37.700 --> 10:42.420
It's a fun! It's just fun. That's all!

10:42.600 --> 10:46.440
We don't get this, all right, we have other one. Doesn't matter!

10:46.620 --> 10:49.540
And now I've been going to countries and countries and countries,

10:49.720 --> 10:53.240
now I would say that first venue I went to, Italy,

10:53.440 --> 10:57.200
- which is today is a great Sahaja yogi nation -

10:57.400 --> 11:00.340
I stayed in a hotel, like this.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.760
And Mr. Gavin had arranged to stay in a hotel and there was going to

11:03.940 --> 11:08.500
be a press conference. And there a very huge meeting for which also

11:08.700 --> 11:13.120
I paid for a big hall. Literally.

11:13.340 --> 11:18.820
So where we were there, with me was Gregoire's first wife. Venda.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.680
And they gave us the, of course, room and all that was nice,

11:22.860 --> 11:26.540
and I stayed there. But when in the evening we went down,

11:26.720 --> 11:32.180
not a single soul from the press and not a single cockroach even

11:32.360 --> 11:37.760
for the meeting! And before that we got,

11:37.940 --> 11:42.880
I for the things went out to do the postering!

11:46.940 --> 11:51.040
And she was so worried that, "If catch us and something

11:51.240 --> 11:54.320
will happen." I said,  “Nobody’s going to catch you. Take it from Me.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.580
Just like we will do." I went and did all the postering, because

11:57.740 --> 12:01.180
we were the only people there.

12:03.520 --> 12:07.860
So this is how it is. Despite that, not a single soul, who came in.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.900
Not a single soul. It's all right. This was fun, you see.

12:12.100 --> 12:17.480
It happened that time, so I could tell you today to you to laugh.

12:18.140 --> 12:21.320
So that is how. They'll real..., they'll realize it

12:21.480 --> 12:24.400
later on in Sahaja yoga. Gradually they [THEY WILL BE KNOW]

12:24.560 --> 12:27.880
[THAT FOR] they have been doing, how they were stupid. How they were.

12:28.040 --> 12:32.160
And they'll enjoy it to themselves. So all humans are important

12:32.320 --> 12:35.800
in Sahaja yoga. Very important. Because that gives a variety

12:35.980 --> 12:38.780
and an interesting theme.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.080
So everything has to be taken as fun.

12:42.260 --> 12:47.080
I wish everybody could completely understand this,

12:47.260 --> 12:50.980
and relax completely on this point. Never get frustrated.

12:51.160 --> 12:55.220
If somebody is not all right, doesn't get vibrations,

12:55.380 --> 13:00.340
you should just smile a little bit, "All right, next that will be."

13:00.560 --> 13:04.100
All right? So may God bless you!
