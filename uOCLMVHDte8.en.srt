1
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:10,839
The relationship between you and Me

2
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,279
is of course very intimate,

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,919
that you should be in My body,

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,359
but if you people are not meditating

5
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:26,519
is very mundane thing I must tell you – Dhyanagamya

6
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,759
if you are not meditating,

7
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:33,279
then I have no relationship with you.

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,159
You are not My relation.

9
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,079
You have no right on Me.

10
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,999
You have no question to be asked,

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,359
why this is happening, why that is happening.

12
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:50,599
So if you do not meditate – I always say meditate, meditate

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,199
I have nothing to do with you.

14
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,759
Are no more there for Me.

15
00:00:56,919 --> 00:01:00,919
It has no connection with Me.

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,999
Then you are like all other people.

17
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,439
You may be Sahaja yogis,

18
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:07,599
you might have got your Sahaja Yoga degree

19
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:11,159
from your leaders maybe, I don’t know,

20
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,839
and maybe that you are regarded as something very great.

21
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:19,319
But, if you do not do your meditation

22
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,759
every day, evening, morning or evening,

23
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:30,359
you will be really not anymore in the realm of Shri Mataji.

24
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
Because the connection is only through gyana,

25
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,919
through meditation.

26
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,279
I have known people who do not do meditation.

27
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,599
Then they suffer, their children suffer, then something happens;

28
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,519
then they start coming and telling Me.

29
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,519
But I see clearly that the person is not meditating,

30
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,759
I have no relationship with him.

31
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,559
He has no right to ask Me anything.

32
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:00,919
In the beginning of course, the meditation takes some time.

33
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,279
But once you will know what is meditation is,

34
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,759
how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me,

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,599
how we can have a rapport with each other.

36
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,439
There’s no need to have anything else in between,

37
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,010
like writing letters or maybe some sort

38
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,519
of a special connection, nothing of the kind!

39
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,839
Only thing that is needed is the meditation.

40
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:30,279
In meditation you grow.

41
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,519
In that spiritually you become higher.

42
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,439
And when that happens, you start,

43
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,079
in a way, I would say

44
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:47,759
that when you reach a state of

45
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,679
that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga,

46
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:57,679
then you don’t want to give up your meditation.

47
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:01,879
Because that time, you are absolutely one with Me.

48
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,839
That doesn’t mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation

49
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:10,919
but it is how much intensely you are with Me is important;

50
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,519
now it is not how much time you are with Me.

51
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,839
Then I’m responsible for you,

52
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,679
for your children, for everyone.

53
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection,

54
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:30,359
to save you from all your negativity.

55
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,639
So it’s not like a father

56
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,759
who will directly punish you,

57
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,759
it’s not that, but it’s just

58
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:44,519
“All right, you are not My relation, I am out.”

59
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,279
That’s the only thing that can happen.

60
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,679
If you are not meditating, all right,

61
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:53,279
I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you.

62
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,759
You may have other relationship, outside, outward.

63
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:01,279
But this inner relationship, by which you get your benevolence,

64
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
you cannot have without meditation.

65
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,199
I’ve been telling all of you, please meditate,

66
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,519
please meditate every day.

67
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:14,359
But I think people are also not understanding

68
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,919
the importance of what I am saying,

69
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:21,111
because they tell Me, “Mother, we don’t meditate.”

70
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:22,359
“Why?”

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,680
“Now we are realized soul, so why should we meditate?”

72
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,679
Now this instrument is fully made,

73
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,519
but if it is not all the time connected for the mains,

74
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:37,199
what’s the use of having it.

75
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,359
In that meditation, you will feel the Love,

76
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:44,359
the divine Love, the beauty of that divine Love,

77
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:48,919
a complete panorama changes.

78
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,519
A meditative person has a very different attitude,

79
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,679
a very different temperament,

80
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,199
a very different life and he lives always

81
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,279
in complete satisfaction with himself.

82
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,079
So today as being the first day, as you say,

83
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,519
of the Advent, say, we can say that it is the first day

84
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,439
when the Advent took place, as we are worshipping today

85
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:21,159
of course it was not today, but still we can say that if that is so.

86
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:28,159
If it has happened and it has been helpful to you,

87
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:32,519
it has been a great blessing to you,

88
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,199
then must know how to preserve it,

89
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,439
must know how to enhance it,

90
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,919
must know how to enjoy it.

91
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:46,959
You should not just get satisfied with one, or can say,

92
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:51,359
one last drama, or one this thing, one that

93
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:56,759
But you should have a full oneness

94
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,199
with the Divine, full oneness.

95
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,759
And that is possible only if you really meditate,

96
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:07,639
which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

97
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,919
Some people say, Mother, we cannot get over time,

98
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:14,519
we cannot think … we are all the time thinking something,

99
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:20,359
or that time we want to see the watch.

100
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,519
In the beginning we may have a little problem,

101
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:26,079
I’m not saying, you may not have, you may have,

102
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,079
but that’s only in the beginning.

103
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,359
But gradually you will be all right.

104
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:35,919
Gradually you will master it.

105
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,159
Gradually you will know it so well

106
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,519
that you would not like to have anything else

107
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:46,159
of a cheaper type, you wouldn’t care for such a thing.

108
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:50,999
You see, so to get to your beauty,

109
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,519
to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

110
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,159
which is now exposed,

111
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:01,599
only thing you have to do really religiously

112
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,199
is to meditate.

113
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:09,065
Everyday you should do meditation.

114
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:12,585
Those who do not do meditation

115
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:16,625
are capable of falling down.

116
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:24,305
Because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp.

117
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:28,865
Those who do not meditate, think they can do without it,

118
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:31,385
are sadly mistaken.

119
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:37,865
They have to meditate, morning and evening.

120
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:42,785
The problem is everything comes so handy,

121
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,105
so simple,

122
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:49,905
that they don’t understand that meditation is very important.

123
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:52,545
Many people.

124
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:57,145
Not you, but there are many I know, who get Realization,

125
00:07:57,305 --> 00:08:00,465
who don’t meditate.

126
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:07,185
And their style is different,

127
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:10,265
their nature is different.

128
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,945
Meditation is such a soothing thing,

129
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:21,305
such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine,

130
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:25,425
that all your problems get solved

131
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,705
in that meditative mood.

132
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:32,505
If you are not meditating,

133
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:36,705
you are not following meditation,

134
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:39,865
then maybe your light will go down,

135
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:43,545
it won’t give sufficient light.

136
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:50,505
Is important, very important,

137
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:56,545
to find out about yourself, about others

138
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,705
in the meditation.

139
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:04,065
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

140
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,545
Don’t do anything

141
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:10,385
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

142
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,305
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

143
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:19,345
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

144
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,785
you’ve done your job.

145
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,385
Because that’s the point where

146
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:29,065
you are with the truth, with the reality,

147
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:30,625
with the joy,

148
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:34,985
with everything that is so fundamental.

149
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:39,185
When you meditate, try not to,

150
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:46,105
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

151
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:50,505
Meditation is something silencing your Self,

152
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:55,705
silencing your thoughts and the going

153
00:09:55,865 --> 00:10:00,105
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

154
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:04,265
But supposing you don’t do that.

155
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,385
If you don’t meditate,

156
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:09,065
I can make out immediately

157
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:12,145
those who are meditating and those who are not

158
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:14,865
It’s not difficult for Me.

159
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:19,665
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

160
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:25,865
they are confused, they can’t understand.

161
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,945
And that’s why meditation

162
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:34,345
is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

163
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:38,225
Just like a light burns,

164
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:41,545
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

165
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:45,585
or by, because of the candles,

166
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,145
in the same way meditation

167
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:58,225
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

168
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:02,545
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

169
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,585
Not only that,

170
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:09,105
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

171
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:15,345
it takes out all the discouraging things.

172
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:19,545
And when you are meditating like that,

173
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:22,585
thoughtless awareness,

174
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:27,185
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

175
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:31,505
from within and without.

176
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:34,625
It’s a terrible power that works,

177
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:37,305
this thoughtless awareness.

178
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:41,785
So those who do not meditate

179
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:44,545
cannot go very much far

180
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,225
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

181
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:51,545
One should try to meditate

182
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:56,265
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

183
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:00,265
So, what happens to you?

184
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:03,625
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

185
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:06,305
what happens to you?

186
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:14,305
Is that you get the confidence,

187
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:19,665
complete confidence of Divinity,

188
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:23,589
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

189
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:27,709
is only possible when you meditate

190
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:31,229
and become thoughtlessly aware.

191
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:37,509
That’s the point where Divine works.

192
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,789
It helps you.

193
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:45,229
It comes to your help in such a way

194
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,389
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

195
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:54,829
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

196
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,789
all of you should achieve.

197
00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:00,149
Very important.

198
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:05,269
After that you can achieve something else,

199
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:09,349
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

200
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:16,365
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

201
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,989
because then there are no thoughts coming

202
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:25,469
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

203
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:30,469
Just in the present you are there.

204
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:34,989
Is something you all have, is not that

205
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,309
Me, I’m saying that to you,

206
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,549
but all of you have this.

207
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,509
But ‘steady yourself’!

208
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:46,189
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

209
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:48,829
How long, that’s not the point.

210
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:51,549
The point is once you touched it,

211
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:54,069
you’ll go on touching it.

212
00:13:54,229 --> 00:14:01,029
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

213
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:06,589
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

214
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:11,509
Now this is the one point which is very important.

215
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,149
If you have to grow,

216
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:17,789
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

217
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,309
through thoughtless awareness.

218
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:22,309
You don’t have to pray,

219
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:24,909
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

220
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:27,949
it just works because it is within you.

221
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:30,269
All these thoughts are bombarding

222
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:33,349
from both the sides in your mind.

223
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:36,149
These thoughts that are coming to you

224
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,989
have no meaning with you,

225
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,069
they do not substantiate.

226
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:45,389
Yourself you are an ocean

227
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:51,989
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

228
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:56,951
So, today’s message is that:

229
00:14:57,151 --> 00:15:02,711
“While meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.”

230
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:06,311
No thought is important,

231
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:09,631
because it’s your own creation.

232
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:14,151
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

233
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:18,551
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

234
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,231
minimum of minimum.

235
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,911
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

236
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,911
and you’ll be amazed how

237
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:32,362
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

238
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:38,908
Meditation is for you, to go deep down into yourself,

239
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:43,557
to achieve all that your Sahasrara wants to give you.

240
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:48,618
To achieve that height of detachment,

241
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:55,386
of understanding is only through meditation.

242
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,947
So what happens in meditation is

243
00:15:58,028 --> 00:16:04,253
that your awareness crosses over Agnya, goes above,

244
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:10,878
and is now stationed in the Sahasrara, in thoughtless awareness.

245
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,587
Then the reality of Sahasrara, the beauty of Sahasrara,

246
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:21,838
starts pouring in your own character, in your own temperament.

247
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:26,083
Unless and until you meditate, not meditate just to get well

248
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:29,134
or just to feel that “I must meditate“.

249
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:32,878
But meditation is very important for all of you

250
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,788
that you develop your Sahasrara in such a manner

251
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:41,818
that you imbibe the beauty of your Sahasrara.

252
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:45,908
If you don’t use your Sahasrara in this way,

253
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:49,898
after some time you’ll find Sahasrara will close down,

254
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:51,858
you’ll have no vibrations

255
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:55,521
and you’ll have no understanding of yourself.

256
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,539
So very, very important thing is to meditate.

257
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:02,589
I can immediately make out a person who has been meditating

258
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:07,469
and the one who has not been meditating.

259
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:10,669
Because a person who does not meditate he still thinks that

260
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:14,459
“Oh, it’s alright, I’m doing this, I’m doing that.”

261
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,609
Meditation is the only way you can

262
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:24,499
enrich yourself with the beauty of reality.

263
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,149
There’s no other way.

264
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,193
I cannot find any other way but meditation

265
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:36,539
by which you rise into the realm of divinity.

266
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:40,121
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

267
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,636
that you’ll meditate every night,

268
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:46,266
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

269
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:50,470
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

270
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:55,671
you are in contact with this Divine power.

271
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,240
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

272
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,300
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

273
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,360
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

274
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,239
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

275
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:22,009
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

276
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,090
which is another great blessing to us.

277
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:37,596
We are the ones who are going to support, look after the Satya Yuga.

278
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:40,736
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening is very,

279
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:44,504
very important, it’s very important.

280
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:52,595
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

281
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:55,596
whatever time you may come home, maybe in the morning,

282
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,706
maybe in the evening, anytime.

283
00:18:57,796 --> 00:19:00,656
But you will know that you are meditating when

284
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:05,493
you can get into thoughtless awareness, then you will know.

285
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:07,484
Your reaction will be zero.

286
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:09,535
Look at something you will just look at it,

287
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,562
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

288
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,152
You won`t react.

289
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:18,343
When that reaction is not there then everything,

290
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:22,697
you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

291
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:26,576
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

292
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:30,653
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

293
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,895
you are one with the Divine.

294
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:37,712
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

295
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:42,795
every moment of your life and looks after you.

296
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:47,676
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

297
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:50,696
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

298
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:53,958
May God bless you!
