1
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:19,812
But the principle of Ganesha is extremely
subtle,

2
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:25,338
is the subtlest of subtle. And it exists
in everything,

3
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:30,788
that it exists in the matter in the form
of vibrations.

4
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,692
There is no matter which is without
vibrations.

5
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:44,782
It has vibrations which are seen even
in the atoms

6
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:51,560
and also in the molecules of all matter
that is existing.

7
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:58,154
So Shri Ganesha is the first one who was
established in the matter, as well.

8
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:01,864
As a result we can see, He exists
in the sun,

9
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:06,503
He exists in the moon, He exists in
the whole universe, in the whole creation,

10
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:10,763
and He continues to exist in human beings
also.

11
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:19,476
And what makes you - the feeling that we
are now a means, a means, we can say,

12
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:25,509
an instrument, a media, by which we express
the Ganesha Tattwa all over,

13
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,881
that is vibrations. So the vibrations
itself about which you are asking,

14
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:35,113
these vibrations themselves are nothing
but the Principle of Shri Ganesha.

15
00:01:35,314 --> 00:01:37,166
He’s Omkara.

16
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:42,484
And when it is, then what is it, that
feeling as I told you, the vatsalya,

17
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:47,345
the feeling of love between a child and
a mother?

18
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:52,880
That feeling, it is the one that is
vibrations

19
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:55,266
between the child and the mother.

20
00:01:55,467 --> 00:02:02,725
The distance between the two is vibrations
and that’s what one has to feel –

21
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:11,414
that he’s a child still and there is the
mother and mother is bringing the child,

22
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:16,175
giving all the powers to the child,
bringing up, loving the child,

23
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:21,268
understanding the limitations of the child,
looking after, all that.

24
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:28,199
All the sweetness, all the wisdom
of the child to be appreciated.

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,351
That is vibrations. And if you see
the subtle side of this,

26
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:38,272
it’s not my child. Should not – this is
not only a limited thing

27
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:43,999
because it is eternal, it’s everywhere,
so you cannot have it limited.

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,556
In everything you do I have seen people,
the way they handle things in the West –

29
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:56,426
we Indians have to learn also from them.

30
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:01,239
(Aside: What’s happening?)

31
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:11,640
So we have to accept for them what is
the way to handle also beautiful things,

32
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:18,035
how to look after beautiful things, how
to manage beautiful relationships.

33
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:21,387
See, you shouldn’t be harsh, you shouldn’t
be unkind,

34
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:25,963
you shouldn’t say things which are
insulting to others

35
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,525
so that the relationships are broken.

36
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:32,731
So all the relationships that are between
human beings and God

37
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:38,326
are through the Ganesha Principle. So
when it becomes the relationship

38
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:42,977
between you and God, then there are
vibrations

39
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:48,603
and then that same relationship should
extend to everything that you do.

40
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:54,337
You should see what things are good,
whatever has got vibrations.

41
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:57,937
Now today I want to tell you something
very important

42
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,436
about this all-pervading power we heard
about.

43
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:06,995
These are nothing but vibrations.
Paramchaitanya is nothing but vibrations,

44
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,768
where all identities are lost –

45
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,863
where the mother is lost, father is lost,
we can say –

46
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:17,066
nothing remains when it is just this
vibrations,

47
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:24,348
this subtle vatsalya exists. That’s all.

48
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:32,510
And this is the only thing out of which
everything comes and remains in itself.

49
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,636
Like we can say that the suns rays come out

50
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:40,953
and then they try to create chlorophyll.

51
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:44,906
So it’s not that we cannot compare sun
with that.

52
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:50,694
Or we can say, from the ocean the clouds
come out

53
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:55,729
and they try to nourish the Mother Earth.

54
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,278
That’s also – cannot be compared.
Everything is inside.

55
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,189
This Paramachaitanya has got everything
inside this.

56
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,246
So we can say that everything is nothing
but knowledge,

57
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,767
is nothing but truth, is nothing but light.

58
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:22,854
But when the folds of these come out, then
we get into the folds of that Chaitanya

59
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:26,791
and then we become ignorant, but there
is nothing like ignorance.

60
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:30,066
It doesn’t exist, it doesn’t exist.

61
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:33,661
Like there is darkness because there is
no light.

62
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:37,702
Once light comes, it doesn’t exist,
doesn’t exist.

63
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,101
So ignorance doesn’t exist.

64
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:49,633
But what happens that the folds of this
ocean, into that people go and it is lost.

65
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,501
Thus we understand one thing very clearly:

66
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:57,290
that we are in Paramachaitanya. We are
made by Paramachaitanya,

67
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,616
all the time we are surrounded by it.

68
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:04,304
Only thing is, we are sometimes lost
in the folds.

69
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:19,298
And why? Why we are lost in the folds is
because of our own – our own unawareness.

70
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:26,097
This awareness has to come: that we are
part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya.

71
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:35,055
The whole thing is called as chitvilasa,
is the vilas,

72
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:42,344
is the playful enjoyment of God’s
Attention.

73
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:45,654
Now you will say, “How can that be?”
For example,

74
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:50,774
we see the sun – and just to give a simile
closer to it, we see the sun

75
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:55,248
and then we see the water. We see
the water in the lake, right?

76
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,378
There is water – because of the sun,
we can see the water there.

77
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,993
Then supposing we see the mirage.

78
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:07,587
We see the mirage and then we think
this is water,

79
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:13,516
we run after the water. But the whole
thing is a play of the sun,

80
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:19,787
whether it’s a mirage, whether it’s
a water, whether it’s the sun.

81
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:26,418
In the same way, this Paramachaitanya
acts and what we get lost

82
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:29,803
is in our awareness that we are
Paramachaitanya.

83
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:33,036
That’s why the play starts, the play starts

84
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:39,091
like yesterday’s – day before yesterday’s
Puja, what did we do?

85
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,866
We were sitting there and it started
raining.

86
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:50,070
So to prove, to prove that I can control
rain.

87
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,629
So it rained. Some people were covering up
something, this thing.

88
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,915
I gave a bandhan. After some time, the rain
moved out

89
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:03,417
from the Puja to the back side. It was not
raining where you were sitting.

90
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,040
And after that, it became the sun and it
was so clouded.

91
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,482
Sun came, it became sunny,

92
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:16,571
so that’s how you have to become aware
of the powers of Chaitanya.

93
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:21,666
Now when you give bandhan, what you do
is to put the Chaitanya into action,

94
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,152
“Now act here, now act there, act here.”

95
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:31,754
Though you are, supposing, in the ocean,
but the ocean acts on you all the time.

96
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:34,934
You cannot act on the ocean, you cannot
ask water

97
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:38,619
to do this and do that. But as realised
souls, you are empowered,

98
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,665
now you can ask water, “Alright, you
dissolve this, you do this, you do that.”

99
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,404
But for that, it is important to be
the masters.

100
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:51,991
And to become the masters, you see, like
a matter becomes a human being,

101
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:55,590
and from human being you have to become
the masters of the matter

102
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,374
and you handle the matter.

103
00:08:57,575 --> 00:09:00,909
So we come back to the same. Like
agriculture, we can handle,

104
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,688
just vibrate it. We can handle water,

105
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:07,496
we can handle the sun, we can handle moon -
because there’s a rapport.

106
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:11,314
Now we are aware a rapport has been
established,

107
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:15,680
so all this play is extremely beautiful
to Me. I see it.

108
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:19,029
But now you all have to know

109
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,242
that you all have become realised souls
and you have those powers.

110
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:29,196
So all other nonsensical things that you
learn,

111
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:35,008
all nonsensical things you indulge into you
better give up. There’s no sense in it.

112
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,569
Whatever is sensible you should do

113
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,246
because there’s Shri Ganesha within you
who is absolutely sensible.

114
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,479
He is nothing but sense. He is the giver
of sense,

115
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,040
so He is the killer of the demons, as they
say.

116
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:53,815
He is the one who removes all the ordeals.
By how? By improving our awareness.

117
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:58,995
Though ordeals do not remain, because
you give a bandhan, it works out.

118
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:03,730
Now I asked somebody – Phil – I asked him
to write down about the miracles,

119
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:08,000
and he says now it has become like
a voluminous book.

120
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:11,975
It will be, because before Realisation

121
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:16,485
whatever looked like miracle is no more
a miracle. Miracle has lost its meaning,

122
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:19,048
because now you are empowered, and you
can do it.

123
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:23,655
It works in everything: in your talent,
in your understanding,

124
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,178
in your education, in everywhere.
Like there are some boys who said,

125
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,813
“Mother, You see, we couldn’t solve
one problem so we gave a bandhan.

126
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:35,212
Immediately the whole thing came onto us
and we wrote it down”, and they stood first.

127
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:40,409
It has happened with many. So in every
action, in every thing,

128
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,486
whatever you do, you should know it is
the Paramachaitanya that acts.

129
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,618
Only thing you have to be aware
of yourself, and aware of it, it acts

130
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:56,758
and you just jump into that awareness
and it works, and that you have seen.

131
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,094
But still so many people do not know.

132
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:04,985
So many people still, though they know
through their brains,

133
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,535
do not know in their hearts. And so many
people,

134
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:11,314
even if they know in their hearts, they do
not act in their attention.

135
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:15,373
So only these three things you have
to improve: is one is your head,

136
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,417
another is your heart and third is your
liver.

137
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:22,626
If you can improve these three organs,
this Paramachaitanya will act.

138
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:26,547
But then, all this attention about money.
So many people,

139
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:30,487
money this, that. There’s nothing to worry.

140
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,579
Paramachaitanya will create everything
for you, whatever you want.

141
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,045
It may not create money because it
doesn’t have a mint,

142
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:44,399
but it will create possibilities –
possibilities

143
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,853
and this is something to be understood
very well, and it’s so blissful

144
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:51,968
to know that now you are aware
of the Paramachaitanya

145
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,429
and you can master It. Master It
in the sense not that you dominate It,

146
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,709
but you ask Him like a djinn. You know,
you can say,

147
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,655
“All right, do this, do that”, with
respect. With respect it works.

148
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:07,224
All these things are to be understood,
now that we have entered

149
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:11,633
into the Kingdom of God, means
Paramachaitanya,

150
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:16,274
and that we are very important citizens
of that.

151
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:22,445
If one can understand this, then I think
Sahaja Yoga can be very successful.

152
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:26,453
Everything will work out. Miraculously,
everything will work out.

153
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:33,070
And all those who are not aware about the
possibilities as to what they can reach,

154
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:35,865
they are thrown out, in the sense,
in the fold,

155
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:39,726
in the ignorance, so called into
the darkness.

156
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:43,594
Again they can come back to light
when they have sense.

157
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,451
So be forgiving about them.

158
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:49,305
It can happen to you also if you
understand that way.

159
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:54,146
I hope today’s lecture you have been able
to assimilate within yourself.

160
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:59,156
That’s very important to assimilate, to
know that you are in the Paramachaitanya

161
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:05,208
and that’s how you will become very sweet,
you will become very considerate,

162
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:10,779
and very loving, affectionate and wise.

163
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,386
That’s very important.

164
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:18,304
May God bless you.
