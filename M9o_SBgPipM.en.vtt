00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm sorry. I have not been able to in a way talk to you... 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.000
to talk to you directly about things and though you know I have been looking after you very well

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:41.810
And I did not have so much time but you know I have to work very
hard and when you have only one program, I

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.810
have three or four programs and I'm working
very hard for them. And you see, I've told

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.620
you that Maharashtra is going to be very fast
movement and we have to move very fast. Now

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.470
what you have to understand is that you have
come for this program of Maharashtra for what?

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.470
Why have you come here? That people must understand.
What I find that there is no understanding

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.210
of this simple fact...with some people...Some
people are murmuring souls among you and they

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.210
don't understand why are they here. They are
here to learn certain things for Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.510
Now, especially if you do not have an ashram
also there's always a problem to learn how

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.510
to live with others and in a way that we should
move 
in a Spartan way, in a Spartan way, how to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.010
live in a Spartan way and how to be smart.
Now see these people here, Maharashtrians

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.210
are. Just look at them, you have to learn
from them. How quick - I don't have to tell

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.659
them anything. See they are so self disciplined
within themselves... I don't have to tell

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.840
them anything. You see, they organize, they're
working so hard, you can't imagine. You are

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.619
doing no work, if you look at it, what work
are you doing? Just taking your luggage, putting

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.370
on the busses, getting down, sleeping again.
What work are you doing compared to them?

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.090
But there is no smartness about it. What I
find, they themselves are seeing you, they

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.939
think you are all lethargic people and some
of you are druggist or what is it? And the

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.400
complaints are so funny, that as if you think
there's a package deal of a touring thing,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.930
bus going and the organization is not good
and some are dominating, and this and this.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.560
It's absolutely absurd, I think. Some people
are taking Sahaja Yoga as a lethargic stuff,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.599
you see, like a drug business, that you get
into lethargy, nobody has to tell you: "Get

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.659
into the bus." But why don't you get yourself?
Everybody must organize, must learn something,

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:56.090
otherwise it's a waste. I think it's a waste
coming down. You have not come here for a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.409
tourism. One thing. Must understand, this
point must be understood by all of you: it's

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.549
not tourism department working this for you!
Little comfort you get immediately you get

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.579
into that nonsense and you must know that
too much of materialism has brought you to

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.680
this stage that you have too much of Ego.
It's a big headache - for Sahaja Yoga and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.909
for you also. You know that! Too much of materialism.
And this matter always tries to overpower

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:32.569
the Spirit and your Spirit is always overpowered
by the Spirit. And you get into a lethargic

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.059
mood and then anybody tries to tell you: "Get
fast or get do", you think, "You are dominating!"

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:42.809
and "This is a - This is a nonsense", I can't
understand this!

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.219
Now why aren't they seeing they want to do
any more organizing? Who wants to do it? Now,

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.370
those who were complaining raise your hands.
Take it over. Good idea! He says: "I don't

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.370
want to do any organizing". All right! Who
wants to do it? Let's see who were complaining

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.790
that he was crossing the maryadas. Now let
them take over! It's not the way to behave.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.859
You see, you must have your own disciplining,
you must learn disciplining. People have taken

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.239
many things for granted. You see and that's
what happened with Nick when he tried to do.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.430
They are very comfortably settled down in
Linda's house. And there also I've seen people

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.620
do the same thing. Because when you - they
live there, there's no need to have any disciplining,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.620
there is nobody to tell. That's not lethargy!
Sahaja Yoga is a Spartan thing, a smart stuff.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.169
See, look at these people, how smart they
are. Early in the morning, 5.30 they're up

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.659
and they are doing the jobs. You see the way
they are organizing, you can't imagine how

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.650
much they are organizing. In far fetched places,
here also to organize everything is an impossible

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.650
situation. Now what are we doing? Just trying
to think that, you see, "We are in a very

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.449
package deal, we are here and that everything
should come to us in a way that is a tourist,

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.970
this thing." Now Warren has retired, now,
who wants to do the job, let me see? Those

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.979
who have complained should I put?

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.449
What's this going on, I just don't understand.
One person starts a joke and everybody starts

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.860
with it - it's absolutely wrong, there's no
tourism going on. You better go back, I'll

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.030
return all your money that you paid Me and
you go back. Here you have come to learn about

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.250
Sahaja Yoga, how to become smart, how to be
Spartan, how to be light.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.250
How much your Mother is working at this age?
I'm sixty years of age. How much I'm working

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.930
- just look at that. You have to be - I'm
your ideal or queen Elizabeth? Who is your

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.930
ideal? I mean I just don't understand. Why
are you here? And one person starts a joke,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.889
another takes it over and they all start talking
like this. This it's absolutely an impossible

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:02.539
situation. I don't have to tell them, even
once. Can't imagine? In the night they cook

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.740
the food for you, you know? In the night - After
the program, they came down, made all that

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.740
food for you here and we took it. Those who
were with Me know that. They cooked the food,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.750
all of them, these young boys and again up
they are in the morning 5.30 organizing everything.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.750
Look at that! Learn from them! You see, you
people, in quality are no good, must understand.

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.539
You have nothing but Ego and a self-consciousness
that you are very great. No, you are not!

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:41.539
I've to tell you very frankly. You have to
come down with that Ego, completely. Material

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.349
development has ruined you completely there.
You see thousands of people raising here their

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:52.389
hands. See the people here! Are we going to
forget all the civilization that's doomed

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.030
one in the West? You are the people, who are
the foundation. What are you, you are not

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.349
saints, are you not?

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:04.610
How does a saint live? You have seen Ramdasa
Swami, I went to see. Now do you realize that

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:11.610
you went to Mahalakshmi, that's one of the
- one of the pithas of, one of the Kundalini's

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:17.400
pitha, you see, of the whole Universe. Did
you follow that? Looking after your comfort

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.400
state or looking after your Spirit, what are
you doing here? Did you go - did you understand

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.340
that the temple was for that? Did you follow
that point? And now I want you to see another

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:37.999
temple and then another temple I'm going to
have. It's not so easy, no tourist has gone

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:44.610
to these temples. Actually no Indians are
- no foreigners are allowed in these temples.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.879
Because you are saints they have allowed you,
but behave like saints. What's this nonsense

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:53.629
going on? Talking about comfort, this nonsense.
What comfort do you have there? I feel most

00:07:53.629 --> 00:08:00.039
uncomfortably in the Western countries. There's
no comfort of the Spirit. Most uncomfortable

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:07.039
I feel. Everybody drinking, everybody nonsensically
- so materialistic, so materialistic. Horrible!

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:17.319
Now don't think too much of yourself for Heaven's
sake. I don't want you to talk that somebody's

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:22.740
dominating you, crossing your maryadas, Sahaj
means lethargy. Why don't you have your own

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:29.509
Spirits and your own arrangements? Everything
you have misleft, 2 rooms, 4 rooms there unlocked

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:34.270
this thing. There's one girl looking after
Me, how smart she is, just see how smart she

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:40.100
is. Even ten English girls can't look after
Me the way she looks after Me. Every little

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.100
bit of that she knows. I'm not saying only
English but all of you have this problem.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:52.100
Please get rid of it! Otherwise forget the
West!

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.570
You have to do tremendous jobs. I'm trying
to look after you the way I can. You have

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.270
to look after yourself. The way you are moving
I just don't understand. Is it a package deal

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.010
you have come? Those who have come for the
first time are more troublesome also. Because

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:12.410
they have never seen this before. I mean those
who want to go back, can go back tomorrow.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.750
I'll give you money, you go back. Rahuri is
going to be much worse than this. This is

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:24.750
the first time you got a hotel - Aaaaa! I
mean, I don't understand the way you have

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.030
to be feeling comfortable. You want a bathroom?
All right, get attached to a bathroom and

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.120
move about with the bathroom all the tour.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.590
I mean you know how I live in England, what
sort of a house I have and what sort of bathrooms

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:47.590
I have. I've have never complained, I've never
thought of it even. Never! For Me it's the

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:55.670
Spirit. And don't think too much of yourself.
Please! Everything they are running, Puja

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.360
they are running, things they are running.
Look at them! Never a problem for Me.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.790
Now you have to go tomorrow to Tuljapur place.
This Vitthala is a very big place here of

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:15.200
Vishuddhi that you have to see and you have
to go to Tuljapur. They are not comfortable

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.090
that's why they never appear in the West.
They are not comfortable there. Who would

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:26.150
have built temples on these stones? They would
have? Do you think they would have understood

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:33.150
Hanumana? See the standards! Look at him how
he lived. Even a person like Shivaji, he lived

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.840
here. He was a king! I mean I have never put
you to any test or anything, but the amount

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.620
of, you see, not that I want you to sleep
in the cold or anything, I didn't want you

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:52.620
to sleep in the cold, that you misunderstood.
But what's this going on? Why don't you get

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.050
up 5 o'clock everyday? I sleep - I work much
more than you too! Today you know what programs

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:04.600
you have? Puja here. You don't have to run
the - anybody's chakras, do you? You don't

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.620
have to raise mountains of Kundalinis, do
you? Stones and stones after thousands of

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:16.600
- do you have to do that? I need not talk
about Myself. Then after that this program

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:23.600
I have to deal with intellectuals, then there's
a press conference, then after the press conference

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:31.310
there's a huge meeting at 6 o'clock.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:40.830
The so-called comforts are nothing but enslavement
of your Spirit. It has enslaved your Spirit,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:53.970
the Spirit is enslaved, believe Me. Get out
of it! It's a nonsense! Your are saints, you

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.210
are seekers of ages, now get out of it, absolutely
get out of it!

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:07.210
They are so Spartan, so smart. Mooladhara
is first class, just see....Early in the morning,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:14.630
5 o'clock bath and finished, they are ready!
What are you thinking all the time, that you

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:22.080
are lazy, every time people see - they told
me some are taking perhaps drugs. That's what

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.180
they felt the way some of you are lethargic.
What is there to tell you, you can't get into

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:34.180
the bus and they can't understand. In 5 minutes
they'll arrange things, 5 minutes. Can you

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.320
imagine, after the program they came here,
cooked food and I was there.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:46.320
Now don't think too much, thinking too much
makes you just lazy lumps....that's all....it's

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:55.020
not good. Thinking is another style of materialism,
is a subtler materialism. What is there to

00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:02.020
think? [Get into bhoots ] Get rid of it! And
there is one bhoot who is of fussy one here,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.980
I know all of them, very well, they have been
always a headache and I don't know why they

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:13.980
have come and they introduce to another person
and that bhoot goes on, on, on, on, on.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:21.470
But all such misfits will get out of Sahaja
Yoga, take it from Me! They'll get out! You

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:31.080
want Sahaja Yoga or not, that's the point.
Then, why worry about comfort? It's most surprising!

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.190
Some of you who have come for the first time
from such a long distances, like Frankfurt

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:43.140
people are perfectly all right, Toronto are
all right. From New York they are all right,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:50.140
these are all right, Steven and his wife they
are all right. I mean they all have the same

00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:01.300
profile. Why other people? Now, please, try
to give Me some joy. I don't want to hear,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:11.820
"Now he wants to resign." You see, everybody
starts talking, "He's very dominating." But

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:20.120
why? What are you? You don't deserve any bad
thing better, do you? You have to be smart.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:27.670
Are you smart? Your Mooladharas' like stones
hanging round, all the time thinking, thinking

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:36.670
- what? Clear your Mooladharas!

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.220
You must have Me as your ideal in Sahaja Yoga.
Look at Me! I mean, can you imagine? I have

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:50.220
so much [slunk ?]! I'm working very hard,
you know that! I'm not - I'm marathon, you'll

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:04.840
go away. You'll go to England, you'll go away
to Europe, you'll go away! What about Me?

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:11.840
I'm still working, working, working, working...Only
reason is that I have a very good Mooladhara

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:22.620
and a very good Agnya and an excellent Sahasrara!
I don't think!

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.190
Talk too much, better not talk! I think you
better stop talking to each other! That's

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:34.100
the best way it will work out. All this nonsensical
things you talk, you have nothing great to

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.990
talk, sublime things, about God, about the
Spirit. You must have peace in yourself! If

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.750
you have peace, you'll enjoy it! The whole
place is so peaceful! Why don't you see the

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:51.750
peace of this place which is lacking in that
horrible comfortable place? All of them! There's

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:59.850
no peace. Feel the peace, you are saints!
Feel the peace of this place; in their hearts

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:06.850
see - feel their peace. The riches have ruined
you. That's the curse! That's the curse! So

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:21.570
feel the peace of the place! There's no peace
within. Feel the peace within. What side of

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.730
all these sides you see, anywhere you go?
"Oh very nice, this is very nice" What is

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.900
nice about it? The peace of it, the subtler
side, you have to be subtler persons to feel

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:40.830
the subtle side. Feel the subtle side, the
music behind, the fragrance behind.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:47.830
If I'm your ideal, I feel very comfortably,
to be very frank. I don't know when will I

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:57.670
be out of that, I call it vanwas, is that
staying in a forest, a jungle. I feel it's

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:07.760
a jungle of people who are anarchist, arbitrary,
such Ego oriented, horrible people those who

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:14.920
don't know how to talk to each other. Horrible!
I'm for vanwas, I hope it finishes after 12

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.110
years. It's real vanwas for me!

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:26.110
But now, you people give me some hope! Now,
no more talking like this! Shut up yourself

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:33.160
for this point! Absolutely! Nobody's going
to talk like this, it's anti-God. See, why

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:40.160
are we here? Get individualistic in the sense
you sit down for meditation, don't talk. Sit

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.320
down for meditation!

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:48.160
You see you are trying to find organization
mistakes. I just can't understand, what is

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:55.160
the matter? Pull your ears for this, please
pull all of you. No more of this nonsense.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.110
And next time such people should not come,
I request such people who have been complaining

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:10.310
please don't come. Look at Genuine, she's
so old, she never says anything. Whenever

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:15.680
I ask her she says: "Mother, I'm happy." You
are not going to enjoy anything, you see,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.520
because you are not subtle. Even coming to
the subtlest places you don't enjoy anything.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:27.520
Where is your attention going? Inward? Believe
Me, they're the most peaceful places where

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.850
you have been. But your brain will never allow,
this brain, this horrid Ego will never allow

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:41.560
you to enjoy. So get rid of it! All right?
Please, I want you to enjoy. I brought you

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:48.560
here to enjoy. Don't criticize! And any side
of comfort, you just get rid of it. You've

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:58.670
got a cot? Sleep on the ground. Best is. Tell
your body: "I'm here! I'm a seeker!" You must

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.610
know your true nature that you are seekers,
you are not like other people but that is

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:10.610
still sticking on into your heads, you still
think on those lines.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:25.360
You must know that you should never challenge
anybody who's organizing. That hurts Me! Never!

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:32.360
He's doing some job, you're doing no job.
Must do that! What job are you doing? Very

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.740
nice to criticize another person! What job
are you doing? Are you responsible for anything?

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.640
Even for your clothes? He's the one who is
working hard, it's very nice to criticize

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.600
such a person! It's like any Dick, Tom and
Harry comes and criticizes Me that: "Why don't

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.680
You do this and why don't You do that?" Is
exactly the same situation. You are doing

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.080
no job, very nicely criticizing others. Why,
for what?

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:02.140
You think you've paid for yourself, you've
paid very little, not much, I know that. How

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.910
much I had to take for your traveling and
the amount of luggage you have brought. It's

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:15.910
a big problem in these places. Even if you
pay you can't get it. But I've not brought

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:21.130
you here to give you comfort at all. You must
know I told you it's a very Spartan one. I've

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:26.640
told you some that don't get more than 80
people. It's an impossible situation. You

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.260
can't get busses, these are from the state
trading busses, we got with great difficulty.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.930
They gave us 2 busses, you see. They have
their own passengers, they have to sacrifice

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:41.930
a lot. These are not the places we - I didn't
want to travel this time, you remember. I

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:50.170
was telling I don't want to travel this time
with all of you. I want to go alone.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.900
I've told you that we have to spend some money,
more sometimes, sometimes less, sometimes

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.820
we have to spend quite a lot, much more than
we expect, sometimes it's lucky that we have

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.770
less money. Whatever money remains it will
go for Sahaja Yoga. I don't want your money,

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:14.370
you know I've already overspent My money.
My bank is exhausted! You know that all! So,

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.860
why you talk like this? You don't think how
much Mother spends. You never think on that.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.150
You know Portugal - what happened. You know
how much money I spent in England. Then you

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:29.190
don't think on these lines, do you, ever?
Are you going to return that money to Me,

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:36.190
anyone of you? But why stupidly talk like
this, as if there's some tourism department

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.080
going on, you paid for the money, you paid
for it, so you find faults with the organizers.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:47.910
Give up all these bad habits, absolutely.
Even if somebody beats you, you are not to

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:54.330
complain now, keep it on that point. Ego needs
beating, nice beating, I tell you. Sometimes

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:59.460
good beating will sort out all the problems.
Otherwise, if nobody beats you, beat yourself.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.100
That's the best way.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:09.100
Now not that everyone is like that; most of
you are very good, I know you are enjoying,

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:14.080
but these are few people who are bhootish
and they are creating this problem and these

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:21.080
bhootish people will give others bhootish
nature, so be careful. Those who have got

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:28.950
the bhoots better turn them out. Just don't
do anymore of this, just stop it. All right?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.720
We have to have self discipline. These people,
look at these people, no problem, no problem,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.040
such love, such organizing capacity. How much
- from 3 o'clock they're waiting here for

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:48.040
Me, 3 o'clock. Every ended up, you see, they
came back by 3 o'clock. Twelve hours. Again

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:55.130
today they are back for Puja. And they are
engineers, they are doctors, they are everything.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:05.720
At least everybody's a graduate, at least,
minimum.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.110
It's true that in England even a garbage cleaner
gets more money than these people can get.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:19.210
But what, so what? Are they going to carry
their money with them or their bathrooms and

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:26.210
their comforts? All these mythical ideas you
must give up. This is another world, that's

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:33.480
another world. You have to adjust yourself
to this world. It's very sickening to Me,

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.090
I tell you. Even if there are one person like
that, will be so sickening. Now don't pay

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:43.360
any attention to anybody who talks like that.
Just shut him down! You are so many who are

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.990
good, only there are few who are funny. You
just shut them down: " Now you will shut up,

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:52.570
this is a bhoot!" on this point. You must
get up early in the morning, do your meditation,

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:59.570
get into busses. You are here for a package
deal for one month to spartan yourself.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:06.970
All right? So, it's a promise. It's a promise
[since forward ?].

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:13.510
Now with Rahuri it's even much more, you see.
The villagers, they are going to get a shock

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.830
that I brought some drunkards with Me and
those who cannot get into the bus, can't get

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:24.830
out, everything and, "I can't do this and
I can't do...". Everything you have to do!

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:30.179
Just it's a promise, it's a promise. We are
going to do it. All of us! All right? Even

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:37.150
I! (Shri Mataji laughing) All right!
May God bless you!

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.830
So not to feel bad, most of you are all right,
most of you are enjoying, I'm not saying,

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:46.540
but there are few who are stupid and you don't
listen to them! Just don't listen! If somebody

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:51.770
says that you shut that out, you'll be amazed
if you shut that person out, you'll be amazed

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:57.730
that person will improve, you'll help that
person! Nobody should talk like this! Noone

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:03.400
should talk like this! It's nonsensical!
All right! May God bless you all!

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:10.400
Let's sit down with the Puja - with that smartness!
We have to be smart not lethargic in Sahaja

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:16.440
Yoga! Sahaja means what? Like lazy lumps?
How are we going to do the work of the whole

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:22.929
world if we are lazy lumps? Imagine the amount
of mountains we have to lift in the West,

00:25:22.929 --> 00:25:28.350
to think of them. And here we are already
exhausted... Haaa - like that! What are we

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:35.350
going to do that? Ha! It's a tremendous task!
See, it's like, I don't know what to say,

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:42.690
it's like taming a hippopotamus or I don't
know what to say! Horrible! And you better

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.370
smarten up yourself, maybe next year I may
never bring anyone of you, I tell you, I'm

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:53.950
so fed up. But this is the style, is the last
chance perhaps, now I was saying it's just

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:59.410
last time but everybody said: "No, no Mother!"
Is it, remember Gregoire... I was not wanting,

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:05.360
really, anybody to come! It's a headache you
know! You still carry the ideas. Now, so that's

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:12.360
Paul! And look at down there! Look at him!
He's any [UNCLEAR], he has a house of his

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.040
own, he has a wife, he has children, all that
he's given up, he's coming. Look at him! He's

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.510
a big engineer with the Municipality, he's
so doing so much of big, big bridges and all

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:30.510
that - he is here? Do you see in it any Ego?
Do you find any Ego in him? Learn, learn from

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.280
them. If not from Me, from them.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.190
The one who arranged our program is a multimillionaire,
do you know that? He's a multimillionaire.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:51.190
The one who took us to his to his farm house,
he's a multimillionaire. But do you find anything,

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.179
any ...While my grandchildren themselves have
just come from a multimillionaire family.

00:26:56.179 --> 00:27:03.179
Do you find that in them? Why? Not that they
don't have money, they don't have comforts.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.120
But he told Me that "I haven't got a car"
- he's a multimillionaire, "because I don't

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:17.120
need it, I need a jeep so I bought five jeeps".
Finished!

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.520
But if somebody gets some money there, he'll
have a swanky car to show off. They can't

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:29.350
understand, "why to buy when I don't need
it, I'm working on the farm". Finished! And

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:35.150
you're telling Me he'll go by ordinary bus,
he'll do everything. He's a multimillionaire,

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:42.150
can you believe? Have you seen his business?
How many [looms ?] he has got, which is working

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:52.047
out? Not that he's miserly, how generous he
was! How his wife lives, how everything, just

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
see! They might be having hundreds of diamonds
in the house but they don't show off. I mean

00:28:00.251 --> 00:28:06.170
we must learn from them, you see, also there
are poor people, all of them are smart, very

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:11.510
smart. They may live in a small, little tent
but you see, early in the morning they go

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:18.010
to the river, have their bath, they're ready
for the job! Smartness is one of the things

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:28.077
you have to get in Sahaja Yoga. Spartan! Living
should be Spartan and smartness. Those two

00:28:28.077 --> 00:28:31.630
things you must keep in you.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:40.690
All right! Otherwise they think half of you
are sick. All right! So no thinking, just

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:48.484
now. Put yourself into Nirvichara. Watch Me,
all of you, watch Me. Raise your heads again.

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:07.417
All right! You've got rid of your vices and
things, but now get rid of this nonsense,

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:12.299
of a Ego. This is the biggest problem you
have. The Ego is the biggest problem. And

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:19.299
when you think you are dominated better accept
it - hundred times. Don't tell others!

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.450
Who's right sided, left sided, right sided,
left sided - everybody's branding everyone!

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:36.450
In Sahaja Yoga nobody remains left, right
sided.

00:29:36.878 --> 00:29:47.600
Better? Much better. Whatever is good for
the Spirit, the enjoyment for the Spirit,

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.809
then you will be in the other world, you see.
Forget this nonsensical world that you have

00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:58.400
been. You are all seekers, you are great people,
God gave you birth in that country, just to

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:09.008
see what materialism is, not to get involved
into it. Get out! But evolve! Get out! We

00:30:09.168 --> 00:30:21.039
have all this poverty, we have all this discomfort.
See the peace. Feel the peace of the landscape,

00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:27.500
of human beings, everybody has peace. Look
the smart little children this age, so happy

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.880
here. All right?
May God bless you!

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:38.962
And don't look miserable, anyone of you. They
can't understand why are you looking miserable.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.160
They are - they think that they are not doing
their work properly or you don't like the

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:52.467
food. They just don't understand because you
look so miserable, anxiety and tired for nothing

00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:53.943
at all. All right, may God bless you!

00:30:53.943 --> 00:30:56.770
Let's have it now! Get up fast and go down!
Let's see how fast you can get up. All right!

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:02.280
Let's see how you get down.
