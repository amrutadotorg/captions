00:00:58.595 --> 00:00:59.595

It's alright, it's alright.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.815
Thank you.

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:58.375
How are you?

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.260
There's so many people here.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.140
I can't believe it.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.640
Thanks very much.

00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:19.655
Thank you.

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:22.915
So, how are you?

00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:24.115
You came from Belgium?

00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:29.695
Now in France?

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:50.825
Alright, may God bless you.

00:04:57.295 --> 00:04:58.295
May God bless you dear.

00:05:02.425 --> 00:05:04.925
So many have arre here, so many

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:07.185
Greeks here.

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:12.495
It's a great

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:13.495
promess to Me.

00:05:13.495 --> 00:05:14.185
Translate it.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.400
Greece should be the first country in Europe

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.340
which should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.800
Because Greece is a – I mean it has a heritage, same heritage [as Indians].

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.600
And we have to give them faith in their heritage now.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.740
All that they have forgotten, they have to remember.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.640
I’m sure it’s going to work out very well now with such [inaudible]

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.340
It’s a, it's an important country, as you know very well, Greece is very important, politically also and military wise.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.180
So it's important that this country should have their own heritage back on themselves.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.620
Because so many people have learnt from you before,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.880
and again if this country comes up to its own level, every body will have to learn.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.340
So you all have to be very proud actually of Greek's land.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.820
And that you have to take the responsability of transforming your country in a beautiful new age country.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.540
You can do it, it's very simple.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.000
I was happy so many dedicated people are there, here.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.760
I've had already before.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.760
I'm so happy.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.020
Yes Mother we are very happy Mother being here. Thank you very much.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.860
I can't see the children before now and it's [Inaudible].

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.940
Yes Mother.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.780
If they can feel the cool breeze alright.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.440

00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:39.020
Thank you.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.900
Yes Mother.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.540
Alright. May God bless you all.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.200
I don't know what are my programs are.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.640

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.160

00:09:14.885 --> 00:09:16.195

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.600
