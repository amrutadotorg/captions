00:22.435 --> 00:24.435


00:24.435 --> 00:26.435


00:26.435 --> 00:28.435


00:28.435 --> 00:30.435


00:30.435 --> 00:32.435
Everybody outside to give the flowers.

00:45.775 --> 00:46.775
Please let's keep the flowers.

00:48.485 --> 00:50.575
Let's keep the flowers till Shri Mataji is sitted.

00:56.955 --> 00:57.955


00:58.595 --> 00:59.595
Alright.

01:01.055 --> 01:02.055


01:05.485 --> 01:06.485
Ah! Please to meet you.

01:25.745 --> 01:28.185


01:35.245 --> 01:36.245


01:38.075 --> 01:39.155


01:42.705 --> 01:43.705


01:49.445 --> 01:50.445


01:54.995 --> 01:55.995


02:08.385 --> 02:09.385


02:17.895 --> 02:19.485


02:19.895 --> 02:21.385


02:23.445 --> 02:24.935


02:26.315 --> 02:27.805


02:27.805 --> 02:29.805


02:29.805 --> 02:31.805


02:31.805 --> 02:33.805
Thank you.

02:36.395 --> 02:39.125


02:41.005 --> 02:43.395


02:44.915 --> 02:45.915


02:47.435 --> 02:49.245
How are you? He's brought so many Sahaja Yogis.

02:50.145 --> 02:52.265


02:54.245 --> 02:56.085


03:08.585 --> 03:09.775


03:09.775 --> 03:11.775
How are you?

03:11.775 --> 03:13.775


03:13.775 --> 03:15.675
Thank you very much.

03:15.675 --> 03:16.675


03:23.555 --> 03:24.555


03:26.255 --> 03:29.165


03:29.365 --> 03:31.685


03:36.655 --> 03:37.815


03:37.815 --> 03:39.815


03:39.815 --> 03:41.815


03:41.815 --> 03:43.815


03:43.815 --> 03:45.815
It's alright, it's alright.

03:45.815 --> 03:47.815


03:47.815 --> 03:49.815


03:49.815 --> 03:51.815


03:51.815 --> 03:53.815
Thank you.

03:55.375 --> 03:56.375


03:56.375 --> 03:58.375
How are you?

03:59.185 --> 04:00.185


04:09.260 --> 04:10.260
There's so many people here.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.140
I can't believe it.

04:12.140 --> 04:12.640


04:12.640 --> 04:14.640
Thanks very much.

04:15.405 --> 04:16.405


04:16.655 --> 04:17.655


04:17.655 --> 04:19.655
Thank you.

04:19.715 --> 04:20.915


04:20.915 --> 04:22.915
So, how are you?

04:23.115 --> 04:24.115
You came from Belgium?

04:26.475 --> 04:27.695


04:27.695 --> 04:29.695
Now in France?

04:33.675 --> 04:34.675


04:45.665 --> 04:46.665


04:48.855 --> 04:50.825
Alright, may God bless you.

04:54.865 --> 04:56.085


04:57.295 --> 04:58.295
May God bless you dear.

04:59.845 --> 05:00.845


05:02.425 --> 05:04.925
So many have arre here, so many

05:06.175 --> 05:07.185
Greeks here.

05:07.185 --> 05:09.185


05:09.185 --> 05:11.185


05:11.185 --> 05:12.495
It's a great

05:12.495 --> 05:13.495
promess to Me.

05:13.495 --> 05:14.185
Translate it.

05:14.185 --> 05:15.185


05:16.055 --> 05:17.495


05:20.065 --> 05:21.065


05:22.085 --> 05:25.185


05:25.460 --> 05:26.460


05:28.500 --> 05:31.400
Greece should be the first country in Europe

05:31.560 --> 05:33.340
which should take to Sahaja Yoga.

05:33.340 --> 05:34.500


05:35.055 --> 05:36.055


05:37.965 --> 05:39.435


05:39.960 --> 05:44.800
Because Greece is a – I mean it has a heritage, same heritage [as Indians].

05:45.080 --> 05:48.200


05:49.005 --> 05:50.005


05:50.600 --> 05:54.600
And we have to give them faith in their heritage now.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.600


05:58.080 --> 06:00.740
All that they have forgotten, they have to remember.

06:00.780 --> 06:03.160


06:04.800 --> 06:07.640
I’m sure it’s going to work out very well now with such [inaudible]

06:08.995 --> 06:12.435


06:12.520 --> 06:13.520


06:15.000 --> 06:23.340
It’s a, it's an important country, as you know very well, Greece is very important, politically also and military wise.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560


06:25.845 --> 06:27.575


06:28.365 --> 06:29.365


06:30.495 --> 06:32.945


06:33.280 --> 06:34.440


06:37.160 --> 06:43.180
So it's important that this country should have their own heritage back on themselves.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.920


06:48.440 --> 06:51.060


06:53.300 --> 06:56.620
Because so many people have learnt from you before,

06:57.300 --> 07:02.880
and again if this country comes up to its own level, every body will have to learn.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.100


07:06.215 --> 07:09.315


07:09.660 --> 07:11.320


07:11.320 --> 07:14.340
So you all have to be very proud actually of Greek's land.

07:14.340 --> 07:15.660


07:16.960 --> 07:24.820
And that you have to take the responsability of transforming your country in a beautiful new age country.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.860


07:27.375 --> 07:28.525


07:28.920 --> 07:30.400


07:32.540 --> 07:34.540
You can do it, it's very simple.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.000
I was happy so many dedicated people are there, here.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.260


07:42.515 --> 07:43.515


07:44.315 --> 07:47.335


07:47.335 --> 07:49.125


07:52.845 --> 07:53.845


07:53.845 --> 07:55.840


07:55.840 --> 07:57.760
I've had already before.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.760


07:59.760 --> 08:01.760


08:01.760 --> 08:03.760


08:03.760 --> 08:05.760
I'm so happy.

08:05.840 --> 08:09.020
Yes Mother we are very happy Mother being here. Thank you very much.

08:09.115 --> 08:10.115


08:10.115 --> 08:12.115


08:12.115 --> 08:14.095


08:14.100 --> 08:16.860
I can't see the children before now and it's [Inaudible].

08:16.880 --> 08:17.940
Yes Mother.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.780
If they can feel the cool breeze alright.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.440
Yes.

08:25.140 --> 08:26.900


08:27.245 --> 08:28.265


08:32.565 --> 08:33.565


08:33.565 --> 08:35.565


08:35.565 --> 08:37.565


08:37.565 --> 08:39.020
Thank you.

08:39.020 --> 08:41.020


08:41.020 --> 08:43.020


08:43.020 --> 08:45.020


08:45.020 --> 08:46.220


08:47.120 --> 08:47.900
Yes Mother.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.540
Alright. May God bless you all.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.200
I don't know what are my programs are.

08:57.380 --> 08:59.640
I don't know about my programs. What do we have.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.160
I will tell You after in the car Mother.

09:06.820 --> 09:07.820


09:08.525 --> 09:09.525


09:11.865 --> 09:12.865


09:13.475 --> 09:14.475


09:14.885 --> 09:16.195
We take this in our car.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.600


09:19.000 --> 09:20.600
Do we take this?

09:20.660 --> 09:22.040


09:24.695 --> 09:25.855


09:31.535 --> 09:32.535


09:34.595 --> 09:35.595
