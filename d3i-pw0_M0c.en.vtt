00:51:51.167 --> 00:51:53.876
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:51:59.626 --> 00:52:14.918
As I told you yesterday, that truth is what it is and we have to keep our mind open as scientists to see what is the truth.

00:52:26.876 --> 00:52:39.042
We cannot organize the truth, and we cannot change the truth, and we cannot ourselves create the truth.

00:52:47.834 --> 00:52:51.375
So what we can do is to know the truth,

00:52:55.709 --> 00:52:57.042
to become the truth,

00:53:00.083 --> 00:53:01.792
and to enjoy the truth.

00:53:05.626 --> 00:53:08.751
It's very abstract if I talk of truth.

00:53:12.751 --> 00:53:20.792
But how do we know truth normally? Is through our sense organs.

00:53:28.209 --> 00:53:35.792
Like, you see all these flowers, and you see through your eyes these are flowers, and you know it is the flowers.

00:53:45.042 --> 00:53:55.334
Anything that you hear, all of you hear the same thing, and you know that's what is the truth what you are hearing.

00:54:02.125 --> 00:54:08.209
Now, you can feel something hot or cold with your fingertips.

00:54:13.834 --> 00:54:19.584
And whatever you can feel with your fingertips is the truth that you know.

00:54:26.417 --> 00:54:38.417
But in darkness, if you are holding the snake in your hand and somebody says, "You are holding the snake," you can always say that "No, I believe it's a rope, it's not the snake."

00:54:50.667 --> 00:54:53.083
So, to know that, you have to have the light.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.834
In human evolution, we have known many more things than the animals quality.

00:55:10.751 --> 00:55:20.000
For example, if you take a dog or a horse through a dirty lane, he won't feel the filth, he won't have any bad smells, he'll just pass through.

00:55:31.209 --> 00:55:32.626
But we cannot.

00:55:35.584 --> 00:55:41.542
In the same way, we can understand aesthetics, which a dog cannot understand.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:56:04.334
We can understand who are the painters and who are better painters — everything we understand with our understanding of the art and music, which is only a human﻿00:00:00:00 00:00:05:00 (Yogi talks in German)

00:56:19.083 --> 00:56:23.000
But actually in this area a confusion starts.

00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:33.167
Some people might say that it's a good… good music, some will say it's not good, somebody will say it's bad.

00:56:42.042 --> 00:56:47.667
At this stage, the ego starts deciding: "I like this. I like that. I like that."

00:56:54.834 --> 00:56:59.876
So this ego creates a problem between us and the truth.

00:57:06.042 --> 00:57:11.626
As shown in this picture, the ego is the yellow part on our head.

00:57:16.626 --> 00:57:19.709
We have given it the colour of the bile.

00:57:21.334 --> 00:57:22.417
YOGINI: Excuse me, Mother?

00:57:22.876 --> 00:57:24.667
SHRI MATAJI: Bile. Of the bile.

00:57:30.375 --> 00:57:35.876
When you have too much bile, then ego starts bubbling more.

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:46.709
That means with the overactivity of the liver you get your ego overdeveloped.

00:57:54.999 --> 00:58:05.042
Yesterday I told you about the cancer disease, but today I'll tell you how much this horrible liver can cost us trouble.

00:58:14.042 --> 00:58:29.459
Actually, when you think too much, then your grey cells are to be transformed — or could be replaced — only by this Swadhishthana Chakra, which is on… working more on the Sun line.

00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:52.792
And the Swadhishthana is put to too much strain, and it neglects your liver, it neglects your pancreas, neglects your spleen and your kidneys.

00:59:05.501 --> 00:59:13.083
As a result of that, too much heat is liberated because liver cannot work any more

00:59:19.125 --> 00:59:20.751
as it becomes so worried.

00:59:23.709 --> 00:59:33.417
With this heat, you get the phlegm melting away, and that's how you will get all these problems of cold, hay fever, sneezing, asthma.

00:59:40.542 --> 00:59:47.125
Then, at the pancreas, as the pancreas also becomes overactive, you develop diabetes.

00:59:52.459 --> 01:00:02.417
In Indian villages, a villager would not take tea unless and until the spoon stands at right angles in the sugar.

01:00:09.751 --> 01:00:11.375
But they never get diabetes.

01:00:13.834 --> 01:00:23.999
Only those people who are futuristic and think too much all the time get diabetes, and then from kidney they get high blood pressure and tensions.

01:00:36.918 --> 01:00:47.834
So, on one side, we are covered by the ego, and on the other side, by our conditioning, which is a superego; and that's how we are cut out from the truth.

01:00:58.999 --> 01:01:06.209
So, to know the truth, what we have to do is to remove both these things, which are covering our brain.

01:01:13.918 --> 01:01:32.999
And as I told you yesterday, that when Kundalini rises, She pierces through this centre of Christ, and the whole of your conditioning and ego is sucked in; and that's how this portion opens up and you get your Self-realization, and you might feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:01:55.375 --> 01:02:05.501
At this time, you find from your fingertips, as you've found yesterday, a kind of a cool breeze blowing inside.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.334
Also you have found yesterday a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:30.000
Many people doubt first, that it might be some window is open or something.

01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:38.417
Yes, of course the window is open — but in your head.

01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:46.167
And that's how you have felt the cool breeze coming out of it.

01:02:50.542 --> 01:02:56.626
This happening is described very well in the ancient scriptures, in all the scriptures.

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:07.918
In some scriptures, it is described in a little ambiguous manner, or a mysterious manner.

01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:24.209
But very clearly it is described by certain saints of India who have very secretly given Self-realization to very few people in the past.

01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:38.918
As I told you, this is a living process of a living energy of evolution.

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:56.083
But beyond these two channels that you've seen, we have some other problems, which are very serious, and we are not aware of them.

01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:11.042
One of them are on the left-hand side, as you know; is the collective subconscious area.

01:04:18.876 --> 01:04:25.292
This area has… has in it all that is dead, since our creation.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.709
And on the right-hand side, you have, at the extreme, something called the collective supraconscious.

01:04:44.584 --> 01:04:53.626
That is what… all the dead who have been very futuristic.

01:04:54.792 --> 01:04:58.125
Contains all the dead who have been very futuristic people.

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:15.751
So now, when there is evil, when you see evil… so many will say there is no evil — because they must be evil themselves — but there is evil.

01:05:24.501 --> 01:05:33.375
This evil crawls into us from the left or from the right, from the collective subconscious or the collective supraconscious.

01:05:40.999 --> 01:05:58.042
When you see many people who go to false gurus and lose all their money, everything, and become bankrupt, and then become recluses, you are surprised that how educated people get into such troubles.

01:06:11.584 --> 01:06:18.626
Even if you, say, do any religion as such, they also end up into this area very fast.

01:06:24.626 --> 01:06:35.584
I'll tell you, in India now we have Hinduism, which is actually basically based on the ascent of human beings, like… or any other religion.

01:06:47.959 --> 01:07:01.417
But if you go to these temples and… during the time when the Goddess is worshipped for nine days, you'll be amazed that we have all kinds of possessed people, dancing and doing all kinds of funny gestures.

01:07:16.626 --> 01:07:29.167
Now, these are all possessed people and — possessed women, and they are mostly maidservants — and they can tell you the name of the horse which is going to win in the races.

01:07:37.918 --> 01:07:43.292
They can tell you all kinds of nonsensical thing which has nothing to do with God or with the Goddess.

01:07:49.792 --> 01:07:59.999
So now we have, say, another religion, which we call as Jainism, who believe in vegetarianism to such an extent that they cannot even kill mosquitoes.

01:08:12.209 --> 01:08:25.125
They get a man inside a hut and put all the little little bugs inside, so the bugs should suck the blood of that man; and they'll revere that man because he has given blood to so many bugs.

01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:49.751
Then we have some Buddhists, who go on having some sort of a… (moves Her hand as if rotating a rattle) what you call… a kind of a… round moving chakras (wheels); goes on humming, humming, humming like mad.

01:08:56.501 --> 01:08:59.459
By doing that, are you going to get your ascent?

01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:09.959
By moving those wheels, are we going to rise in our evolution?

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:26.626
And they think that by beating on the… vertebral column, beating on this column, vertebral column, that they can raise the Kundalini.

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:34.459
And they can go to any extreme, the beat.

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:41.792
Basically, behind all these things is money-making.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:51.501
All these lamas and all these are making lots of money, and they have too much gold with them.

01:09:57.501 --> 01:09:58.792
Now you come to Islam.

01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:07.999
And you find that in Islamic religion same thing: people are just quarrelling and fighting; now you see Iraq, Iran — it's mad thing.

01:10:15.999 --> 01:10:17.542
Then you come to Christianity.

01:10:20.042 --> 01:10:22.417
Christianity is the religion of compassion.

01:10:26.959 --> 01:10:29.792
But Christians are the cruellest people you could think.

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:39.834
When they went to America, they killed all the aboriginals.

01:10:39.834 --> 01:10:47.167
In South America, you can't find one person who can be called as a Red Indian, not one person.

01:10:55.459 --> 01:11:01.542
They came to India with a… one… gun in one hand and Bible in another hand.

01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:16.250
Are they the disciples of Christ, who said: "O My Father, please forgive them because they do not know what they are doing"?

01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:29.999
Christ has said: "Thou shalt not have any adulterous eyes."

01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:40.626
Have you found any… even Christian priests who are… who haven't got adulterous eyes?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.792
So, when we see religion becoming so funny and perverted, we start losing faith in God.

01:12:03.542 --> 01:12:05.667
And many people believe there is no God.

01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:10.501
But I think this is very unscientific.

01:12:14.167 --> 01:12:24.334
You must find out the truth, is there God or not, is there a Creator or not.

01:12:25.042 --> 01:12:35.250
Without finding it out, if you just say there is no God, because you've seen all this religious nonsense, you must know that you have done no justice to your creator.

01:12:44.999 --> 01:12:56.999
All these great Incarnations, and all these prophets, and all these great people who came on this Earth to establish proper religion — have been misused!

01:13:05.167 --> 01:13:07.667
Have been… they have been used for money-making!

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:12.542
Or for power!

01:13:15.667 --> 01:13:17.459
They have nothing to do with God.

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:27.209
But God exists — and now can be proved when you get your Self-realization.

01:13:32.125 --> 01:13:39.042
Actually, Buddha felt: no use talking about God; because if you talk about God, they'll forget about Self-realization.

01:13:39.042 --> 01:13:43.667
So He said, "First I'll tell them about Self-realization, Self-realization, Self-realization."

01:13:56.375 --> 01:14:05.501
So now I have to tell you that this Power resides within you, which is coiled up in three and a half coils within yourself.

01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:18.542
And this Power has to manifest itself in these modern times in a big way.

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:29.334
Of course, you cannot pay for it, it is too invaluable.

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:34.751
And it works out.

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:43.709
Not only works out but it helps you to get rid of most of your problems, and you become a very powerful personality.

01:14:53.501 --> 01:14:59.000
Your compassion doesn't become just a talk, talk, but it becomes effective.

01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:05.584
It works.

01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:20.876
Because this all-pervading Power, which starts flowing through you, is a thinking power, understanding power, is intelligence.

01:15:32.167 --> 01:15:37.584
It organizes, it cooperates. Above all, it loves.

01:15:43.834 --> 01:15:45.918
It's such a great thing to discover it!

01:15:49.375 --> 01:15:51.918
And also to discover about yourself.

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:59.334
Which is such a glorious, beautiful thing!

01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:09.626
And it has to work out in a big way.

01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:20.292
It has been already predicted all over in so many ways that this was the time for it to work out.

01:16:26.876 --> 01:16:29.125
There have been never so many seekers!

01:16:32.999 --> 01:16:38.999
It's the special category, which William Blake has described as "men of God".

01:16:46.626 --> 01:16:57.918
And he has said… he has said that these men of God will know themselves and they will have power to make others know themselves.

01:17:07.417 --> 01:17:12.417
So it's very important to understand the value of human life.

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:21.167
That you are at the epitome of your evolution.

01:17:25.999 --> 01:17:33.834
And with this last happening, you will break through into that new realm of a realized personality.

01:17:42.334 --> 01:17:46.667
Whatever I may say, you have not to take Me for granted.

01:17:52.918 --> 01:18:05.834
You yourself have to experience it, and see for yourself, and achieve your complete establishment into the truth.

01:18:12.167 --> 01:18:13.999
Truth which is Divine Love.

01:18:17.999 --> 01:18:19.167
So may God bless you!

01:18:27.626 --> 01:18:32.250
If you have any questions, I would like to answer them.

01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:37.375
But not too many, because I would like to meet all of you one by one today.

01:18:51.999 --> 01:18:53.999
(To a seeker) [UNCLEAR] today for the first time?

01:18:57.250 --> 01:19:00.626
Then let's have it from yesterday first and foremost.

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:11.918
We'll have it from yesterday first of all. People who came yesterday as well can ask the questions first.

01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:40.584
(After a pause) Yes, that's the trouble. Once you have your Self-realization, no questions.

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:52.709
(To a seeker) From yesterday?

01:19:53.626 --> 01:19:55.334
(To yogini) [Maria], is it from yesterday?

01:19:59.626 --> 01:20:01.834
YOGINI: She hasn't wanted to question.
SHRI MATAJI: Today or yesterday?

01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:03.584
(To a seeker) Was it your first time, madam?

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:06.626
YOGI: No, she wasn't there.

01:20:06.999 --> 01:20:08.751
SHRI MATAJI: She wasn't there? You see, that's the trouble.

01:20:20.459 --> 01:20:22.375
Let's have it, then, from today.

01:20:23.501 --> 01:20:28.501
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:21:02.999 --> 01:21:07.999
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:21:23.375 --> 01:21:25.792
No, no, you don't have to worry about "worthy".

01:21:27.167 --> 01:21:31.459
You don't have to decide. Your Kundalini knows.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:34.667
Everybody is worthy of it.

01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:45.083
You don't have to judge yourself.

01:21:47.792 --> 01:21:49.417
Only keep happy, that's all.

01:21:54.626 --> 01:21:57.626
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:21:59.292 --> 01:22:00.292
YOGINI: What is the purpose of—

01:22:00.292 --> 01:22:02.334
YOGI: What is the meaning of Self-realization?

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:03.501
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, Self…

01:22:04.834 --> 01:22:19.000
The purpose of Self-realization is to know your Self, where the Self is the embodiment of truth and embodiment of joy.

01:22:20.542 --> 01:22:36.751
And when you have Self-realization, then your attention becomes active and knows everything; apart from that, it works out all the problems.

01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:40.709
(Laughing) It's a big question.

01:23:04.375 --> 01:23:08.626
First of all, all your physical problems are solved. Most of them.

01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:19.792
Then your mental, emotional, spiritual problems are solved.

01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:30.626
You do not get into any tensions, you become a very kind personality.

01:23:31.876 --> 01:23:32.959
(Repeating to yogini) Any tensions.

01:23:39.584 --> 01:23:43.999
Then you start seeing everything as a drama.

01:23:49.918 --> 01:23:53.999
Now, if you are in the water, you are afraid of getting drowned.

01:23:54.334 --> 01:23:59.584
But supposing you are in the boat — then you see it, you don't mind… anything.

01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:15.584
But if you are a master swimmer, then you are not afraid of anything, and you can make others also master swimmers.

01:24:23.417 --> 01:24:26.334
Then you become collectively conscious.

01:24:26.334 --> 01:24:34.999
Is becoming; again I say, you become, it's not just mental, that "we are all brothers and sisters", or in just like just you will start reading each other's thoughts.

01:24:43.959 --> 01:24:48.876
You start feeling another personality within yourself on your fingertips.

01:24:54.375 --> 01:24:58.292
So you realize that innate relationship between you and others.

01:25:05.918 --> 01:25:19.792
Then you get over all kinds of racialism, all kinds of false ideas of religion, or conditioning, of a country, this, that — all the nonsense that's going on.

01:25:29.918 --> 01:25:32.834
Now, supposing you become a democratic country.

01:25:36.334 --> 01:25:39.375
Then, at the extreme, you become very money-oriented.

01:25:45.626 --> 01:25:47.083
Terrible competitions,

01:25:49.209 --> 01:25:52.959
when the individual is given [utter] importance and collective [has none].

01:26:00.876 --> 01:26:02.999
So such a country again goes down.

01:26:07.876 --> 01:26:11.209
But supposing you are a communist.

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:20.792
Then you… you become very strong in your collective, but individually you go down.

01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:29.459
Because you have no value for the individual.

01:26:33.167 --> 01:26:36.292
As a result, your individual suffers.

01:26:40.918 --> 01:26:50.709
But when you get your Self-realization, then every individual is nourished, and the collective becomes strong.

01:26:59.667 --> 01:27:06.375
Now, we have about fifty or sixty nations from where we have Sahaja Yogis.

01:27:11.876 --> 01:27:14.626
Numberless. Quite a lot.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:20.334
Germany, of course, is not so good, I must say. Not so many. I don't know why.

01:27:27.999 --> 01:27:34.209
But I have never seen anybody quarrelling, fighting, saying bad words, hurting…

01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:53.918
If sometimes somebody does hurt someone, again he is… apologises and tries to be all right — because he sees what's wrong with him.

01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:05.876
And he doesn't like it. He just throws away.

01:28:10.083 --> 01:28:14.334
Unless and until we can see ourselves, how are we going to correct?

01:28:22.999 --> 01:28:30.083
But it's not mental, it just works out through the awakening and reawakening of Kundalini.

01:28:35.834 --> 01:28:38.209
And the complete transformation takes place.

01:28:42.834 --> 01:28:48.083
There is no question of any war or any kind of a conflict.

01:28:54.667 --> 01:28:58.250
Everybody is in complete joy and happiness.

01:29:03.375 --> 01:29:09.792
The marriages are successful, the children are beautiful — and it's a new world, and a new age.

01:29:19.083 --> 01:29:23.042
This transformation is needed for the emancipation of humanity.

01:29:28.999 --> 01:29:34.042
We have all these institutions like United Nations, this, that.

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:38.667
What work are they doing? They have not given any transformation.

01:29:47.792 --> 01:29:54.667
This is what it is. This is the purpose in the transformation of human beings into their beauty and glory.

01:30:14.459 --> 01:30:17.459
It's quite a small question — and a big answer.

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:31.000
Because I have given at least five-six lectures about it; and if you are interested, you can get the tape, and listen to it, and understand it in more details.

01:30:40.626 --> 01:30:53.000
[UNCLEAR] most of the people perhaps know what is Self-realization is, and what are the advantages are, but even if they want to know all the details, they can listen to these tapes and can understand.

01:31:07.834 --> 01:31:14.709
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:34.417
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:36.667
Of course!

01:31:37.542 --> 01:31:40.999
Yes, yes, of course, of course! Why we are human beings.

01:31:40.999 --> 01:31:44.626
You'll get the answer why we are living and why we are human beings.

01:31:44.959 --> 01:31:46.501
YOGINI: He says he has another question for You.

01:31:48.417 --> 01:32:00.709
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:32:00.667 --> 01:32:03.417
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:32:04.042 --> 01:32:06.709
SHRI MATAJI: Now, that is we shouldn't worry just now.

01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:09.501
None of you are going to die just now.

01:32:10.167 --> 01:32:12.459
It's a question of present.

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:15.501
What are we going to get at the present.

01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:34.167
You see, what happens after death depends on the person also.

01:32:39.375 --> 01:32:41.250
Let's see what happens just now.

01:32:51.542 --> 01:32:52.459
(To a seeker) Yes, madam?

01:32:54.417 --> 01:33:03.834
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:33:10.667 --> 01:33:11.417
(To yogi) What's she saying?

01:33:13.834 --> 01:33:14.876
Nothing wrong?

01:33:14.999 --> 01:33:17.584
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] [that You raise] Kundalini.

01:33:18.209 --> 01:33:21.999
SHRI MATAJI: Oh. That is in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

01:33:22.501 --> 01:33:34.834
It's the… that's what I said, you were not here yesterday; I explained that this Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone called as sacrum and that the Greeks knew the word "sacrum".

01:33:35.083 --> 01:33:36.167
SEEKER: What can I do!

01:33:37.375 --> 01:33:41.209
SHRI MATAJI: That's what it is, we are going to do that. I am very happy to hear that question.

01:33:41.667 --> 01:33:46.834
Why don't you sit down, we are going to do it now. Very happy [to know]. All right?

01:33:52.959 --> 01:33:56.751
That's the very question I was wanting to hear.

01:33:59.209 --> 01:34:04.209
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:34:19.876 --> 01:34:29.125
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:35.792
I don't want to pass any remarks about Ramakrishna. That's all.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.959
Let us see [if it cures or not] has been proved now.

01:34:40.834 --> 01:34:43.209
We shouldn't worry about people just now.

01:34:43.209 --> 01:34:44.959
Let us worry about ourselves.

01:34:46.125 --> 01:34:48.999
Because I don't want to say something about Ramakrishna also.

01:35:04.417 --> 01:35:07.250
But we have cured people of cancer, no doubt.

01:35:11.792 --> 01:35:14.209
[UNCLEAR] with Kundalini awakening.

01:35:17.626 --> 01:35:20.250
If somebody did not do, that's not our business.

01:35:22.042 --> 01:35:24.667
If somebody did not do, that is not My business.

01:35:29.375 --> 01:35:32.876
I am responsible for what I'm saying today before you.

01:35:38.125 --> 01:35:40.334
What has happened in the past is past.

01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:45.918
I take your responsibility.

01:35:51.834 --> 01:35:57.999
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:15.334
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:36:15.334 --> 01:36:17.918
Yeah. That can be also cured.

01:36:26.292 --> 01:36:27.417
It can be cured.

01:36:27.417 --> 01:36:29.584
(A seeker asks another question)

01:36:30.167 --> 01:36:34.501
YOGINI: And homosexuality You have cured too?

01:36:34.792 --> 01:36:35.584
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I have.

01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.000
There's a little problem with AIDS.

01:36:46.417 --> 01:36:55.375
We have two cases which we have cured, and one we had cured who again went back to the same habit, and… he is no more now.

01:36:55.375 --> 01:37:00.667
They don't have will power. Their will power is very poor. [UNCLEAR].

01:37:06.834 --> 01:37:09.999
But a Sahaja Yogi doesn't get all these diseases.

01:37:10.667 --> 01:37:13.918
He doesn't get any one of these diseases — if he is a Sahaja Yogi.

01:37:22.209 --> 01:37:28.667
But if he is not established Sahaja Yogi, just to come and gone away, then we can't say; but if they are Sahaja Yogis, they don't get it.

01:37:37.292 --> 01:37:38.542
That's the thing you get.

01:37:40.334 --> 01:37:44.584
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:37:46.083 --> 01:37:49.751
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:54.209
Maybe. Also karmas.

01:37:54.459 --> 01:37:58.000
But in realization your karmas are all sucked in.

01:38:14.083 --> 01:38:18.709
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:38:20.334 --> 01:38:24.584
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:38:25.334 --> 01:38:28.542
Yes, practically most of them. Practically most of them.

01:38:28.542 --> 01:38:33.167
But if something is dead and all that, then you could say we cannot do it.

01:38:33.167 --> 01:38:39.542
For example, if there's a cataract, we will not be able to cure a cataract.

01:38:40.626 --> 01:38:48.083
Or something dead. You see, supposing there's a fibroid, or some sort of things there are. So many people cannot be cured.

01:39:00.918 --> 01:39:03.000
You see, unless and until you get your…

01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:06.167
(To yogini) Huh? She's asking question?

01:39:06.167 --> 01:39:07.834
YOGINI: No.
SHRI MATAJI: (To a seeker) [UNCLEAR], madam?

01:39:08.417 --> 01:39:10.999
SEEKER: I just said [UNCLEAR] [I was fine].

01:39:11.375 --> 01:39:13.834
YOGINI: She just told me to [UNCLEAR].

01:39:13.834 --> 01:39:16.584
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?
YOGINI: She just told me [UNCLEAR].

01:39:16.584 --> 01:39:17.209
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:29.876
But there's one thing I must really, at the very outset, confess to you.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.542
At the very outset, I must confess to you something — that the Divine is common sense.

01:39:47.626 --> 01:39:48.834
It's not a doctor.

01:39:53.584 --> 01:39:59.959
It is only interested in people who will do divine work.

01:40:06.083 --> 01:40:10.334
It's like… supposing there's a lamp here which goes out of order.

01:40:11.125 --> 01:40:21.209
Now, if this lamp cannot be used again for giving light, nobody would be interested in repairing it, isn't it?

01:40:33.834 --> 01:40:39.334
So, Divine works for people who are willing to give the light to others.

01:40:48.918 --> 01:41:00.542
The light of love, without any money, without any power exerted, and without any gains whatsoever.

01:41:25.042 --> 01:41:29.709
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:41:35.167 --> 01:41:37.584
(Yogi translates the question to Shri Mataji)

01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:38.876
(Laughing) Oh yes, all right.

01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:43.042
That's the best way [UNCLEAR].

01:41:43.334 --> 01:41:46.792
All right, now the time is up, let's have our Self-realization.

01:41:51.459 --> 01:41:54.000
Sit down. Supposing I've done the cooking.

01:41:54.959 --> 01:41:59.792
And if you are hungry, you will not ask many questions, you'll just say, "Mother, let's have the food!"

01:42:10.792 --> 01:42:14.918
But those who are not hungry will just ask questions and won't eat anything.

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:23.250
So best thing is that you better have your Self-realization.

01:42:33.417 --> 01:42:40.167
At the very outset, I [would again] request you to do few things which are very simple.

01:42:47.584 --> 01:42:50.626
One of them is that you have to take out your shoes.

01:42:55.375 --> 01:42:59.209
This is how we take the help of our Mother Earth.

01:43:03.834 --> 01:43:09.709
Now, those who do not want to have Self-realization should leave this hall.

01:43:23.083 --> 01:43:28.209
Those who just wanted to ask questions have already left.

01:43:32.959 --> 01:43:38.999
So. Now let's have it, something that is so important for us.

01:43:45.209 --> 01:43:56.792
The another thing is that — as I am here only for today, and I'll come back after one year — I would also like to tell you how to raise your Kundalini yourself.

01:44:07.042 --> 01:44:16.000
Because even if it is awakened and breaks through, but again goes back to the places where you require energy.

01:44:26.542 --> 01:44:35.709
So, after realization all of you should attend the workshop and understand what is happening within yourself.

01:44:43.876 --> 01:44:46.417
Where is the problem and how to correct it.

01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:57.000
Also you must know what… what is the decoding of this message on the fingertips.

01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:13.999
And also you should know how to give realizations to others and fix them up, fix their Kundalini up for ever.

01:45:23.626 --> 01:45:27.751
Also you will learn how to cure yourself and cure others.

01:45:33.042 --> 01:45:35.876
And for all this you don't have to pay any money.

01:45:40.292 --> 01:45:46.959
But in the beginning, I would request you not to bring all the relations who are sick.

01:45:55.584 --> 01:45:57.584
First you all become the doctors.

01:46:00.959 --> 01:46:07.792
And then start treating the people whom you want to treat or to help.

01:46:15.584 --> 01:46:18.417
So, first you have to be well equipped.

01:46:19.834 --> 01:46:21.292
You have to be well equipped.

01:46:25.167 --> 01:46:32.250
All right. Now, the second thing is to put your left hand towards Me this way, which is very simple.

01:46:38.584 --> 01:46:42.501
Now, this represents your desire to get Self-realization.

01:46:49.834 --> 01:46:54.375
And with the right hand we start releasing our chakras one by one.

01:47:00.042 --> 01:47:03.334
And I'll tell you how to do it in proper way.

01:47:07.459 --> 01:47:09.999
Because the right hand is for action.

01:47:13.167 --> 01:47:23.042
And you have to sit very comfortably, to put both feet on the ground, straight touching the ground, in the parallel way.

01:47:30.167 --> 01:47:38.250
Put the left hand like this, and the right hand is to be used for touching different centres on the left-hand side.

01:47:49.542 --> 01:47:52.918
Now, I'll tell you first you have to touch your heart.

01:47:57.125 --> 01:47:59.709
In the heart resides the spirit.

01:48:04.083 --> 01:48:10.626
Now, you have to put your right hand now in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:48:18.167 --> 01:48:18.751
Now.

01:48:19.751 --> 01:48:25.667
You have to take this hand there because this is the centre of your mastery.

01:48:31.918 --> 01:48:37.125
Now, you have to take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:48:41.999 --> 01:48:45.667
This is the centre of pure knowledge of the Divine.

01:48:51.667 --> 01:48:56.459
Now. Here, when you start moving up, the Kundalini moves up with you.

01:48:56.626 --> 01:49:04.667
So now you put your hand again back on the centre of your mastery in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:49:15.999 --> 01:49:18.709
Now, take this right hand on your heart.

01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:31.542
Now, put this right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your head to your right.

01:49:42.042 --> 01:49:48.876
Please take it from the front, like that. Not this way, not this way.

01:49:55.501 --> 01:49:57.167
All right, now turn to your right.

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:10.792
Now. This is a very important centre because most of the people catch it when you feel… I would say, when you feel guilty.

01:50:18.083 --> 01:50:23.459
Then take your hand on your forehead across and press it on both the sides.

01:50:30.417 --> 01:50:32.584
Here is the centre of forgiveness.

01:50:36.751 --> 01:50:42.375
Now. Take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push it back.

01:50:50.083 --> 01:50:53.501
This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness.

01:50:57.375 --> 01:50:58.999
Now stretch your hand fully.

01:51:01.667 --> 01:51:11.167
And the centre of your palm, you put it on top of your head, in the centre where it was a soft bone in the fontanelle bone area.

01:51:19.042 --> 01:51:20.459
Now move your scalp.

01:51:21.667 --> 01:51:29.375
Press it hard, push out your fingers, move your scalp clockwise seven times. Scalp.

01:51:40.792 --> 01:51:43.334
That's all. Now you have to close your eyes.

01:51:47.292 --> 01:51:50.751
Before that, I'll tell you what mistakes sometimes we'll commit.

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:59.459
First is, your hand, left hand should be like this (shows Her hand palm up) and not like that (shows Her hand palm forward).

01:52:06.501 --> 01:52:07.292
Left hand.

01:52:09.292 --> 01:52:18.167
Second is that the second hand that you'll use, this hand should be taken from the front for this centre (puts Her right hand on Her left Vishuddhi).

01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:31.584
And again, not this way, but this way.

01:52:34.459 --> 01:52:36.834
Is very simple thing that we have to do.

01:52:37.167 --> 01:52:38.542
Now you can close your eyes.

01:52:38.501 --> 01:52:44.999
If you want, you can take out your spectacles also because it might be your eyesight might improve.

01:52:54.042 --> 01:52:56.999
Now, please don't open your eyes till I tell you.

01:53:01.292 --> 01:53:11.709
Now. Put the left hand towards Me and… you don't have to fight with yourself, don't have to fight with your thoughts, just be relaxed.

01:53:20.417 --> 01:53:23.584
Actually, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:53:23.834 --> 01:53:27.834
(To a seeker) No, not like that. Now see, again I… just open your eyes.

01:53:28.792 --> 01:53:31.709
Put the hand like this comfortably on the table.

01:53:36.959 --> 01:53:38.834
Stretch the hand, yes.

01:53:39.125 --> 01:53:42.209
Not this way (stretches Her arm palm forward), not that way (stretches Her arm palm up), just on the table.

01:53:49.292 --> 01:53:55.042
Now, don't bend to much, don't make it back, but just sit straight, comfortably.

01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:13.125
Now, I've told you that you are at the epitome of your evolution and you should not feel guilty; on the contrary, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.417
First thing, you have to forgive yourself.

01:54:31.042 --> 01:54:39.375
Now, let us have your left hand like this, comfortably put, and both the feet little apart from each other.

01:54:39.626 --> 01:54:44.626
And now you close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart.

01:54:57.999 --> 01:55:04.125
Now, as I told you, in the heart resides the spirit, so you ask Me a very fundamental question.

01:55:09.751 --> 01:55:11.999
Put the fingers straight on the table.

01:55:20.292 --> 01:55:26.000
Please ask Me a question; you may address Me as Mother or Shri Mataji.

01:55:33.209 --> 01:55:37.667
So please ask the question three times: "Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:55:37.667 --> 01:55:39.667
Just ask the question. Three times.

01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:02.167
This question is very important.

01:56:02.417 --> 01:56:08.918
But this also means that if you are the spirit you are your master.

01:56:09.167 --> 01:56:21.501
So ask the second question, by putting your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen, upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side: "Mother, am I my own master?"

01:56:21.501 --> 01:56:23.501
Ask this question three times again.

01:56:57.792 --> 01:56:59.584
Now, take down your right hand.

01:56:59.584 --> 01:57:01.584
Please don't open your eyes, keep them closed.

01:57:07.375 --> 01:57:09.167
Don't you open your eyes at all.

01:57:12.334 --> 01:57:17.209
Now, put down your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:57:23.626 --> 01:57:34.709
Here is the pure knowledge of the divine laws.

01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:40.250
But I cannot force you.

01:57:41.626 --> 01:57:54.709
So, I have to ask you to ask Me, like: "Mother, may I have the pure knowledge? Mother, please give me the pure knowledge."

01:58:16.042 --> 01:58:20.459
Ask this question six times because this centre has got six petals.

01:58:35.667 --> 01:58:40.626
By asking for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward.

01:58:48.459 --> 01:58:59.876
So, now you raise your hand, right hand, in the up— in the lower part… upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:59:10.083 --> 01:59:20.167
Here, to open the centre, with full confidence please say: "Mother, I am my own master."

01:59:20.167 --> 01:59:21.667
Please say this ten times.

01:59:56.083 --> 01:59:56.709
Now.

01:59:58.584 --> 02:00:02.334
Please raise your right hand on your heart.

02:00:08.542 --> 02:00:16.167
To open this centre, you have to say with full confidence: "Mother, I am the spirit."

02:00:16.167 --> 02:00:20.626
Say it twelve times because this is the most fundamental truth.

02:00:53.417 --> 02:01:09.918
Now, raise your right hand to your neck, the corner between the neck and your shoulder, and place your head on the right-hand side.

02:01:18.584 --> 02:01:21.959
This is the centre caught when you feel guilty.

02:01:26.999 --> 02:01:31.667
So please say with full confidence: "Mother, I am not guilty."

02:01:42.250 --> 02:01:43.918
Say it sixteen times.

02:01:53.292 --> 02:02:04.334
Now, we have to know that the Divine is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss.

02:02:05.375 --> 02:02:09.167
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

02:02:09.792 --> 02:02:16.584
And there is nothing that cannot be dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

02:02:35.042 --> 02:02:44.250
But now if you feel guilty still, you can say it for hundred and eight times to punish yourself if you still feel guilty.

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:07.876
Now, take your hand to your forehead.

02:03:12.626 --> 02:03:15.292
Keep your eyes closed, don't open them in between.

02:03:18.584 --> 02:03:20.250
And press it on both the sides.

02:03:24.999 --> 02:03:30.000
Now, here you have to say: "Mother, I forgive everyone."

02:03:36.542 --> 02:03:41.459
Maybe you might think that it is difficult.

02:03:45.167 --> 02:03:49.125
But whether you forgive or don't forgive, it's a myth.

02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:53.501
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

02:04:03.083 --> 02:04:06.209
Just say it once, but from your heart.

02:04:12.584 --> 02:04:22.167
Now, you can take your right hand and put it on the back side of your head and allow your head to rest on it.

02:04:31.584 --> 02:04:35.959
Now, do not feel guilty or do not count your mistakes.

02:04:36.125 --> 02:04:45.584
Without feeling all that, you have to, just for your own satisfaction, say: "O Divine, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me."

02:05:03.375 --> 02:05:08.417
Please put your hand on the back side of your head, back side, not on top. The back side.

02:05:13.792 --> 02:05:16.542
And push it upward. Now say it from your heart.

02:05:22.918 --> 02:05:34.542
Now stretch your hand fully, push back your fingers, and put the centre of your palm on the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood, and press it hard.

02:05:46.792 --> 02:05:55.000
Now, stretch back your fingers, and press it hard, and press your scalp, moving clockwise seven times.

02:05:55.250 --> 02:06:05.000
At this time, you have to say that "Mother, please give me my realization," because I cannot force on your liberty.

02:06:29.459 --> 02:06:33.209
(To yogini) Because I do not want to force it on them.

02:06:33.792 --> 02:06:35.000
They have to ask for it.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.083
Now take down your hand.

02:07:27.375 --> 02:07:28.292
Put the left—

02:07:29.751 --> 02:07:31.959
Please open your eyes.

02:07:36.209 --> 02:07:42.459
Put your right hand towards Me like this.

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:49.000
Like this, so high.

02:07:50.584 --> 02:08:03.292
And now raise your left hand and see for yourself, bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

02:08:17.667 --> 02:08:20.375
Now, you put your left hand towards Me.

02:08:25.125 --> 02:08:30.999
And bend your head and see with your right hand if there's a cool breeze coming out.

02:08:57.167 --> 02:09:05.334
Now, you again put your right hand and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

02:09:05.876 --> 02:09:08.959
Out of your fontanelle bone area, a cool breeze.

02:09:08.918 --> 02:09:11.751
Some people get it far away, some very near.

02:09:23.292 --> 02:09:24.999
You have to little bit bend your head.

02:09:31.792 --> 02:09:35.250
Now, put both the hands towards the sky.

02:09:39.459 --> 02:09:42.792
And now push back your head and ask the question.

02:09:50.501 --> 02:09:54.501
Ask the question: "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

02:09:55.167 --> 02:09:58.042
Or, ask the question: "Is this the Chaitanya?"

02:09:58.792 --> 02:10:05.834
Or, ask the question: "Is this the All-pervading Power of Divine Love?"

02:10:06.125 --> 02:10:08.626
Ask this question three times.

02:10:24.375 --> 02:10:26.250
Ask this question three times.

02:10:30.584 --> 02:10:34.999
Now please, you can put down your hands.

02:10:45.167 --> 02:10:46.667
Please put down your hands.

02:10:47.709 --> 02:10:58.042
All those who have felt the cool breeze on top of their heads or in their hands, please raise both your hands.

02:11:07.042 --> 02:11:08.250
I would like to see.

02:11:11.876 --> 02:11:12.626
Aah!

02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:15.167
Look at that!

02:11:17.250 --> 02:11:19.417
Surprising! Thank you very much!

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:30.667
Some may not get it, maybe; they might get it next time.

02:11:31.292 --> 02:11:39.334
They should all go to the workshop and work it out.

02:11:51.167 --> 02:11:54.626
Those who have got it are the lucky ones.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.334
And those who haven't got it should not be disappointed, it can be worked out very easily.

02:12:12.375 --> 02:12:16.375
Now, I would like to meet all of you, those who want to meet Me.

02:12:16.501 --> 02:12:21.334
You can come one by one from here, and I would like to meet you all.

02:12:56.626 --> 02:13:00.667
(To a seeker) How are you? All right? You felt the cool breeze?

02:13:00.999 --> 02:13:02.000
SEEKER: Yes, Shri Mataji.

02:13:02.417 --> 02:13:09.542
SHRI MATAJI: Felt it? You should now [do] [UNCLEAR], and you must meet him, and [meet] this workshop and see for yourself.

02:13:09.751 --> 02:13:13.667
Just a problem here in your Kundalini, you see? Stomach.

02:13:13.667 --> 02:13:16.209
Have you been to some other guru, some other person?

02:13:17.667 --> 02:13:18.667
That's the problem.

02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.876
(To somebody) Who?

02:13:22.999 --> 02:13:23.709
You too?

02:13:29.834 --> 02:13:31.834
[UNCLEAR].

02:13:33.999 --> 02:13:36.667
This is yours? Whose is this one?

02:13:39.459 --> 02:13:40.125
[UNCLEAR].

02:13:41.042 --> 02:13:43.042
(A seeker approaches)

02:13:43.042 --> 02:13:44.250
SEEKER: Hello!

02:13:47.375 --> 02:13:48.000
SHRI MATAJI: Felt it?

02:13:49.417 --> 02:13:50.751
SEEKER: Yeah, the whole body is actually…

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:51.626
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

02:13:52.042 --> 02:13:53.876
SEEKER: The whole body is a cool breeze.

02:13:53.834 --> 02:13:56.375
SHRI MATAJI: (To yogi) What's he saying?
YOGI: His whole body is a cool breeze, Shri Mataji.

02:13:56.584 --> 02:13:58.584
SHRI MATAJI: (Laughing) What does that mean, "the whole body"?

02:13:58.584 --> 02:14:01.042
SEEKER: Just don't know if this here, or here, here…

02:14:01.042 --> 02:14:03.751
SHRI MATAJI: Everywhere? [Very] [UNCLEAR] (laughs).

02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:08.999
[UNCLEAR], it's very good, [UNCLEAR].

02:14:08.999 --> 02:14:10.959
Now, where do you live, you live in Munich?

02:14:11.501 --> 02:14:12.375
SEEKER: Oh yes, three years.

02:14:12.542 --> 02:14:16.417
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. You better go and see these people, master it now, all right?
SEEKER: All right.

02:14:16.417 --> 02:14:17.792
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR] [others|brothers].
SEEKER: Of course.

02:14:17.792 --> 02:14:19.626
SHRI MATAJI: Good, what do you do? You are a student?

02:14:20.292 --> 02:14:23.209
SEEKER: Oh… the whole lifetime studying.

02:14:23.584 --> 02:14:24.667
SHRI MATAJI: That's the good [UNCLEAR].

02:14:25.959 --> 02:14:27.417
Come and see them, all right?

02:14:28.334 --> 02:14:29.834
May God bless you! Thank you!

02:14:39.375 --> 02:14:40.876
He's good, he's very good.

02:14:41.209 --> 02:14:43.542
May God bless you! [UNCLEAR].

02:14:44.542 --> 02:14:46.542
(Another seeker approaches)

02:14:46.542 --> 02:14:48.918
So? Now, have you felt it or not?

02:14:53.999 --> 02:14:56.209
YOGI: She feels it warm in her hand, Shri Mataji.

02:14:56.167 --> 02:14:56.999
SHRI MATAJI: Both hands?

02:14:59.959 --> 02:15:02.209
YOGI: Just in the right hand she feels it warm, Shri Mataji.

02:15:03.167 --> 02:15:04.000
SHRI MATAJI: On this hand?

02:15:05.918 --> 02:15:08.209
Did you been to some gurus? Have you been at some gurus?

02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:17.000
That's why. Now, you put your hand there (puts the seeker's right hand on the seeker's stomach and starts working on the seeker's left hand).

02:15:17.417 --> 02:15:22.834
All right. Now you just say: "Mother, I am my own master, I am my own guru." Just say it.

02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:26.584
Just say it from your heart, with full confidence.

02:15:43.417 --> 02:15:44.501
Now, are you feeling?

02:15:47.209 --> 02:15:51.167
All right? Now. You say: "I am my own master."

02:15:52.584 --> 02:15:54.876
No master needed now any more.

02:16:08.751 --> 02:16:10.042
All right, you've got it now.

02:16:11.417 --> 02:16:13.918
All right? Now, this is the mantra for you.

02:16:16.918 --> 02:16:19.501
Now, you go and see them, and they will teach you how to do it.

02:16:23.542 --> 02:16:27.292
Now, so you become the guru, there's no need to have any gurus any more.

02:16:32.501 --> 02:16:35.626
That's why the… the other one (points at Her left hand). [UNCLEAR], all right?

02:16:39.209 --> 02:16:41.209
(Another seeker approaches)

02:16:41.209 --> 02:16:44.000
YOGI: She is a Sahaja Yogini, Shri Mataji, she is [UNCLEAR].

02:16:46.918 --> 02:16:51.209
She is… her body is not producing the white blood corpuscles, Shri Mataji.

02:16:53.417 --> 02:16:54.375
SHRI MATAJI: Not producing?

02:16:54.375 --> 02:17:02.000
YOGI: Yes, she's not producing white… she has to have blood… to get fusions, transfusions; every two or three months she gets.

02:17:02.999 --> 02:17:07.375
SHRI MATAJI: Aah! You should have asked her to come and see Me.

02:17:07.375 --> 02:17:10.125
YOGI: No, last— She did not really…

02:17:10.083 --> 02:17:11.834
SHRI MATAJI: (To the yogini) [I'll get you when I've done] patients.

02:17:12.959 --> 02:17:15.999
YOGI: She'll come to—
SHRI MATAJI: All right, please ask, she is coming with us to camp?

02:17:21.250 --> 02:17:23.542
YOGI: Yes, Shri Mataji, she will come.
SHRI MATAJI: (To the yogini) Go to camp, and I'll work it out, all right?

02:17:27.250 --> 02:17:28.417
It's being [quiet].

02:17:28.417 --> 02:17:29.999
(Another seeker approaches)

02:17:29.999 --> 02:17:30.501
Come along.

02:17:32.667 --> 02:17:34.375
Now. How are you?

02:17:34.375 --> 02:17:39.999
SEEKER: No, I feel good, but I have felt some problems with my stomach, here.

02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:41.167
SHRI MATAJI: What's the problem?

02:17:41.167 --> 02:17:49.125
SEEKER: Oh… all the time when we… when we start it, I have some ache here…

02:17:50.292 --> 02:17:51.292
SHRI MATAJI: Feeling [start] [UNCLEAR]?

02:17:51.292 --> 02:17:52.584
SEEKER: I had some ache here, obviously.
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR].

02:17:52.584 --> 02:17:54.334
You have been to some guru or someone?

02:17:54.626 --> 02:17:55.167
SEEKER: No.

02:17:55.584 --> 02:17:58.083
SHRI MATAJI: No guru? What sort of books your read?

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.459
SEEKER: Many books…
SHRI MATAJI: What about?
SEEKER: … philosophic…

02:18:02.167 --> 02:18:03.542
SHRI MATAJI: More about…?

02:18:03.999 --> 02:18:05.876
(Yogi asks the seeker about something)

02:18:05.876 --> 02:18:07.250
SEEKER: Sometimes.

02:18:08.083 --> 02:18:10.292
YOGI: He's reading esoteric books, Shri Mataji.

02:18:10.292 --> 02:18:11.709
SHRI MATAJI: Now put your right hand there (puts the seeker's hand on his stomach).

02:18:12.334 --> 02:18:13.083
Put it down.

02:18:13.959 --> 02:18:16.709
And just say: "Mother, I am my own master." (Starts working on the seeker's left hand)

02:18:16.999 --> 02:18:18.876
And don't read those books. Not good.

02:18:24.999 --> 02:18:25.459
Heart.

02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:29.167
Heart.

02:18:33.542 --> 02:18:37.876
Could you say that, [please repeat]: "Mother, I am my own master."

02:18:38.667 --> 02:18:41.167
"Mother, I am my own master." (The seeker repeats the words)

02:18:41.167 --> 02:18:42.667
Again say. Press hard.

02:18:43.042 --> 02:18:44.876
SEEKER: Mother, I am my own master.

02:18:45.792 --> 02:18:46.375
SHRI MATAJI: Again.

02:18:46.375 --> 02:18:48.334
SEEKER: Mother, I am my own master.

02:18:48.334 --> 02:18:48.876
SHRI MATAJI: Again.

02:18:49.584 --> 02:18:52.584
(The seeker continues repeating the words)

02:18:56.751 --> 02:18:59.542
Now all right? Feeling the cool breeze?

02:18:59.501 --> 02:19:00.584
SEEKER: Yes. It's cool.

02:19:00.584 --> 02:19:03.334
SHRI MATAJI: This is your mantra. All right? Use this.
SEEKER: Thank you.

02:19:04.042 --> 02:19:05.250
SHRI MATAJI: They'll tell you how to do it.

02:19:06.501 --> 02:19:07.209
Come and see them.

02:19:09.584 --> 02:19:13.334
You must come and see them and get perfect. All right?

02:19:13.334 --> 02:19:14.542
(Another seeker approaches)

02:19:14.542 --> 02:19:15.626
So, now, how are you?

02:19:15.959 --> 02:19:17.834
SEEKER: Very fine, thank you.
SHRI MATAJI: You felt the cool breeze?

02:19:17.834 --> 02:19:23.334
SEEKER: Yeah.
SHRI MATAJI: Good! Now enjoy! [What is there?] (Laughter)

02:19:23.334 --> 02:19:26.667
You come and see them, all right? And they'll tell you what it is.

02:19:26.667 --> 02:19:27.667
You're from what country?

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:28.918
SEEKER: Indonesia.

02:19:28.918 --> 02:19:30.876
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, good! [UNCLEAR].

02:19:31.334 --> 02:19:35.125
All right, come and see them, and they'll tell you what has happened and how to work it out.

02:19:35.125 --> 02:19:36.959
And you should take it to Indonesia also.

02:19:37.292 --> 02:19:39.042
SEEKER: OK. Thank you.

02:19:40.999 --> 02:19:42.999
(Another seeker approaches)

02:19:42.999 --> 02:19:44.209
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, so you felt it?

02:19:44.375 --> 02:19:46.209
SEEKER: (Happily) Yes, I can feel it!
SHRI MATAJI: I can see the joy now. (Laughter)

02:19:47.417 --> 02:19:49.667
SEEKER: But I feel very unsure of myself.
SHRI MATAJI: Why?

02:19:49.667 --> 02:19:53.042
SEEKER: I feel some pulsation here and…
SHRI MATAJI: I know, but you have been to some guru?

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.792
SEEKER: Yeah, Rajneesh. Many years [UNCLEAR].

02:19:55.792 --> 02:19:56.250
SHRI MATAJI: To whom?

02:19:56.250 --> 02:19:58.083
YOGI: She was ten years with Rajneesh, Shri Mataji.

02:19:58.083 --> 02:20:06.626
SEEKER: Yeah. Yeah. [From] [UNCLEAR] '77 and… what [is|he's] called [UNCLEAR] ['83], but [none] [UNCLEAR] me.

02:20:06.626 --> 02:20:08.167
SHRI MATAJI: Put your hand down there (puts the seeker's right hand on the seeker's stomach).
SEEKER: Yeah.

02:20:08.167 --> 02:20:11.000
SHRI MATAJI: Say: "Mother, I am my own master." (Starts working on the seeker's left hand)

02:20:11.292 --> 02:20:13.709
SEEKER: Mother, I am my own master. Shall I close my eyes?

02:20:13.667 --> 02:20:15.375
SHRI MATAJI: No. Again.

02:20:15.375 --> 02:20:16.999
SEEKER: Mother, I am my own master.

02:20:18.834 --> 02:20:19.334
SHRI MATAJI: Again.

02:20:19.709 --> 02:20:21.167
SEEKER: Mother, I am my own master.

02:20:21.167 --> 02:20:21.709
SHRI MATAJI: Again.

02:20:22.292 --> 02:20:25.751
(The seeker continues repeating the words)

02:20:25.751 --> 02:20:28.751
(Shri Mataji indicates a yogi to start working on the seeker's heart)

02:20:40.125 --> 02:20:40.792
All right?

02:20:42.375 --> 02:20:43.125
It's working now?

02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:46.667
[Feeling] there? [I'll finish there] (points to the seeker's stomach).

02:20:47.501 --> 02:20:49.375
Feeling [UNCLEAR] in the stomach [UNCLEAR]?

02:20:49.375 --> 02:20:49.918
SEEKER: Yeah.

02:20:51.083 --> 02:20:53.959
SHRI MATAJI: Ravana mardini Om sakshat, Ravana mardini Om sakshat …

02:20:53.959 --> 02:21:04.292
(Shri Mataji stretches Her right hand towards the seeker's stomach and continues repeating the mantra)

02:21:04.292 --> 02:21:05.292
All right?

02:21:05.250 --> 02:21:10.876
SEEKER: Yes. I [want] my [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR]. Here.

02:21:11.999 --> 02:21:13.501
SHRI MATAJI: (To yogi) Say the mantra of Ravana mardini.

02:21:16.667 --> 02:21:18.667
(The seeker bends with pain)

02:21:18.667 --> 02:21:20.792
All thanks to this horrible fellow.

02:21:21.834 --> 02:21:25.083
Why don't you all write in the newspapers what they have done to you?

02:21:25.083 --> 02:21:27.459
SEEKER: Why? I don't know.

02:21:27.459 --> 02:21:28.334
SHRI MATAJI: You should write.

02:21:28.626 --> 02:21:33.334
Not only you should write, but you should also point out how much money they have taken from you.

02:21:34.542 --> 02:21:39.209
They have cheated you all through and given you problems and troubles, isn't it?

02:21:39.667 --> 02:21:40.918
You should all write about it.

02:21:43.167 --> 02:21:45.542
And never allow them to come here. (Pointing to somebody) Ha!

02:21:48.709 --> 02:21:49.292
Now better?

02:21:52.167 --> 02:21:52.834
Better now?

02:21:52.999 --> 02:21:53.834
SEEKER: Yeah.

02:21:54.083 --> 02:21:55.250
SHRI MATAJI: You are going to be all right.

02:21:55.250 --> 02:21:57.667
SEEKER: Yeah, I will. Thank you.
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR]. Become a master yourself.

02:21:57.667 --> 02:21:58.459
SEEKER: Uh-huh, thank you.

02:21:59.959 --> 02:22:01.999
(Another seeker approaches)

02:22:01.999 --> 02:22:03.501
YOGI: He is my father.
SHRI MATAJI: I could make out. (Laughs)

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.501
It's [horrible] [UNCLEAR], [that's all].

02:22:07.751 --> 02:22:10.083
(To the seeker) What about you, sir? Did you feel anything?

02:22:10.083 --> 02:22:11.083
SEEKER: Yeah.
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

02:22:11.083 --> 02:22:12.501
SEEKER: The breeze in the left hand.

02:22:12.501 --> 02:22:13.501
SHRI MATAJI: Left, not—
SEEKER: With the left.

02:22:13.501 --> 02:22:15.250
SHRI MATAJI: … not right?
SEEKER: No. The left hand.

02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:17.042
SHRI MATAJI: (Working on the seeker's right hand) Because, I think, you read a lot, do you?

02:22:17.042 --> 02:22:20.083
(The seeker nods in the affirmative, everybody laughs)

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.542
Can you come forward a little bit?

02:22:27.167 --> 02:22:28.959
Is all parasympathetic, doctor.

02:22:29.501 --> 02:22:31.542
You're working out your parasympathetic.

02:22:31.542 --> 02:22:32.834
SEEKER: It's all autonomic.

02:22:33.167 --> 02:22:37.459
SHRI MATAJI: It's an autonomous is your… you can work out your sympathetic but not your parasympathetic.

02:22:37.792 --> 02:22:39.792
You're working out your parasympathetic now.

02:22:39.999 --> 02:22:40.501
SEEKER: Yes.

02:22:40.751 --> 02:22:42.709
SHRI MATAJI: Now. All right?

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:43.709
SEEKER: Work it out?

02:22:43.876 --> 02:22:46.959
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. It's there! You worked!

02:22:50.834 --> 02:22:54.083
So, there are some doctors who are doing research, and they have got MBs.

02:22:54.417 --> 02:22:56.250
Now you also join hands with them.

02:22:56.584 --> 02:22:58.834
And they'll tell you how you can cure people.

02:23:00.125 --> 02:23:02.125
Better? Feeling better now?

02:23:02.125 --> 02:23:02.751
YOGI: He [UNCLEAR].

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.209
SHRI MATAJI: Mm. What's his age?

02:23:07.626 --> 02:23:08.501
YOGI: Fifty-six.

02:23:08.999 --> 02:23:09.667
SHRI MATAJI: Only?!

02:23:10.501 --> 02:23:14.250
You are ten years younger to Me! (Laughter)

02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:14.876
Yeah!

02:23:16.417 --> 02:23:19.626
But see how much worried you are. Now don't read all these nonsensical books.

02:23:21.292 --> 02:23:23.417
Don't read, they are useless. Throw them out.

02:23:29.209 --> 02:23:30.209
Much more relaxed now.

02:23:31.042 --> 02:23:33.375
(To yogi) Did you ever see? Just see on the top of his head.

02:23:33.334 --> 02:23:35.417
YOGI: Vibrations are tremendous!
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, tremendous, tremendous!

02:23:36.292 --> 02:23:38.876
(To the seeker) You are a seeker and have been a seeker in many lives.

02:23:39.375 --> 02:23:40.459
Now don't waste it.

02:23:46.584 --> 02:23:49.959
[UNCLEAR], [he's now a fifty-six].

02:23:50.792 --> 02:23:52.959
Really! Just imagine!

02:23:52.959 --> 02:23:54.584
(Another seeker approaches)

02:23:54.584 --> 02:23:55.918
Now.

02:23:55.918 --> 02:23:57.667
(To yogi) He look very young now. He look very young.

02:23:57.667 --> 02:23:59.792
YOGI: He does, Shri Mataji. He is young, in my…

02:24:00.125 --> 02:24:01.834
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, he look very very young now.

02:24:01.959 --> 02:24:03.876
(To the seeker) Now, did you feel the cool breeze in your hands?

02:24:04.042 --> 02:24:08.167
SEEKER: I'm… not very much [UNCLEAR].
SHRI MATAJI: [You don't have to] [UNCLEAR] (puts the seeker's left hand on his stomach).

02:24:08.292 --> 02:24:10.626
Read too much? What do you study? (Starts working on the seeker's right hand)

02:24:11.792 --> 02:24:13.667
SEEKER: I'm studying… I'm in a…

02:24:18.417 --> 02:24:21.709
YOGI: He's an… an engineer, Shri Mataji.

02:24:22.792 --> 02:24:23.209
SHRI MATAJI: Good.

02:24:24.667 --> 02:24:29.042
Ask a question: "Mother, are You the Engineer of all the engineers?"

02:24:30.751 --> 02:24:31.167
SEEKER: No.

02:24:32.083 --> 02:24:33.459
SHRI MATAJI: Ask the question, ask.

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:38.459
(The seeker asks the question in German)

02:24:38.459 --> 02:24:39.125
SHRI MATAJI: Now again.

02:24:39.626 --> 02:24:44.918
(The seeker continues repeating the question)

02:24:50.626 --> 02:24:52.834
Now? Feeling it little bit?

02:24:54.459 --> 02:24:54.999
Not yet?

02:25:00.792 --> 02:25:01.876
Again ask the question.

02:25:01.876 --> 02:25:04.667
(The seeker continues repeating the question)

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.751
Now? Felt it? Started.

02:25:22.250 --> 02:25:23.751
Now just say: "You are."

02:25:24.876 --> 02:25:30.000
(The seeker continues repeating the affirmation)

02:25:35.667 --> 02:25:38.459
(Shri Mataji puts Her fourth finger on the seeker's forehead and keeps turning it clockwise)

02:25:38.459 --> 02:25:39.083
There, you see.

02:25:40.042 --> 02:25:41.042
SEEKER: Ah, yes, now.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.125
YOGI: He feels it, Shri Mataji.
SHRI MATAJI: All right? [UNCLEAR] answered.

02:25:44.083 --> 02:25:47.959
I'm like a computer, all right? You're asking a computer and get the answer, all right?

02:25:48.292 --> 02:25:50.417
Understand now? Good.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.042
(Another seeker approaches)

02:25:58.042 --> 02:25:58.876
What do you want, [UNCLEAR]?

02:25:58.876 --> 02:26:01.959
SEEKER: I was… may I ask You something?

02:26:02.167 --> 02:26:03.542
I watched from [UNCLEAR].

02:26:03.918 --> 02:26:07.292
I'm sick at… [UNCLEAR].

02:26:07.584 --> 02:26:08.417
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR]?

02:26:08.417 --> 02:26:09.000
SEEKER: My…

02:26:11.209 --> 02:26:13.083
YOGI: This finger, Shri Mataji.
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

02:26:13.083 --> 02:26:14.959
YOGI: This finger, something wrong with this finger.
SEEKER: Can I cure it?

02:26:15.584 --> 02:26:16.542
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR] it for now.

02:26:18.876 --> 02:26:19.709
[UNCLEAR].

02:26:26.375 --> 02:26:29.459
Only on one, on one, only one hand? Another one?

02:26:36.709 --> 02:26:40.709
YOGI: She had an operation there, Shri Mataji. Something was wrong with her nerves…

02:26:42.167 --> 02:26:44.876
SHRI MATAJI: That's the problem, you see, with the operation they cut it out.

02:26:45.918 --> 02:26:47.209
[Actually, you can [bend] it].

02:26:55.167 --> 02:26:56.083
Only one finger?

02:26:57.042 --> 02:26:57.584
SEEKER: These two.

02:26:58.417 --> 02:26:58.959
SHRI MATAJI: This one?

02:27:00.501 --> 02:27:01.792
This one was also operated?

02:27:01.999 --> 02:27:02.834
SEEKER: No, only this.

02:27:05.250 --> 02:27:08.876
They don't know why this… this has happened.

02:27:10.083 --> 02:27:14.459
YOGI: (To somebody) [UNCLEAR] play some music… should be more relaxed the whole atmosphere.

02:27:15.501 --> 02:27:19.250
SHRI MATAJI: They will tell you what is to be done and [UNCLEAR] can clear it out.

02:27:20.834 --> 02:27:23.626
Your right side. All right?

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.334
Are you married? Are you married?

02:27:29.334 --> 02:27:30.751
SEEKER: I am… no, I am divorced.

02:27:31.375 --> 02:27:34.459
YOGI: She's divorced, Shri Mataji.
SEEKER: I think it is… it is something in my…

02:27:37.501 --> 02:27:39.751
I feel guilty. So…

02:27:39.751 --> 02:27:40.334
SHRI MATAJI: For what?

02:27:41.250 --> 02:27:41.959
SEEKER: For this (points at her hand).

02:27:44.918 --> 02:27:45.959
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR]. (Laughs)

02:27:48.167 --> 02:27:50.167
Not to feel guilty, you have done nothing wrong.

02:27:50.292 --> 02:27:53.000
It's because you are unhappy with your husband.

02:27:53.626 --> 02:27:54.709
That's why you've got it.

02:27:55.999 --> 02:27:58.876
SEEKER: Yeah. But it was fifteen years…

02:27:59.209 --> 02:28:00.334
SHRI MATAJI: That's why you've got it.

02:28:01.542 --> 02:28:03.209
[Can you tell Me how many years back]?

02:28:03.709 --> 02:28:06.584
YOGI: She's divorced since… fifteen years, Shri Mataji.
SHRI MATAJI: [Since being] [married]?

02:28:06.876 --> 02:28:08.834
YOGI: This one she got since…

02:28:11.959 --> 02:28:13.792
Since half a year she got this, Shri Mataji.

02:28:15.876 --> 02:28:18.959
SHRI MATAJI: That could be [UNCLEAR]. [She has probably] [UNCLEAR], all right?

02:28:19.209 --> 02:28:20.959
They will tell you what is to be done.
SEEKER: Yes.

02:28:20.959 --> 02:28:22.751
SHRI MATAJI: This is all right, this is straightened now.

02:28:23.792 --> 02:28:25.125
This is straight.
SEEKER: This is all right, yeah.

02:28:25.667 --> 02:28:27.292
SHRI MATAJI: This is all right. This will also straighten.

02:28:27.709 --> 02:28:31.584
We don't know if the doctors have cut part of it, but this is all right, you see?

02:28:32.334 --> 02:28:34.709
This is straight, isn't it? You can see it so clearly.

02:28:35.751 --> 02:28:37.209
SEEKER: Oh yes, much better.

02:28:37.209 --> 02:28:39.626
SHRI MATAJI: Much better now. You see that? It's much better.

02:28:40.292 --> 02:28:41.250
SEEKER: Yes, much better.

02:28:42.999 --> 02:28:45.125
SHRI MATAJI: One straight. This one is the problem.

02:28:45.667 --> 02:28:47.542
Maybe this might also…

02:28:47.501 --> 02:28:48.584
(To the awaiting seekers) Who else? Please come along.

02:28:49.834 --> 02:28:51.000
(To the seeker) Sit down this side.
SEEKER: Thank you.

02:28:55.501 --> 02:28:59.125
SHRI MATAJI: Go and see them. (To the yogi) I think it's better if she sees you and then you tell her how to do it …

02:28:59.125 --> 02:29:00.459
YOGI: Yes, Shri Mataji.
SHRI MATAJI: … right.

02:29:00.834 --> 02:29:02.042
Not to the right [UNCLEAR].

02:29:02.751 --> 02:29:04.584
YOGI: It's looking all right now, Shri Mataji.
SHRI MATAJI: This is yes.

02:29:09.709 --> 02:29:10.709
This one is all right.

02:29:14.250 --> 02:29:17.501
SEEKER: If You could…
SHRI MATAJI: [So much] [UNCLEAR].
SEEKER: It's… it's nice if You do this. (Laughter)

02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:23.626
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR].
SEEKER: It's not pain.

02:29:23.626 --> 02:29:24.834
SHRI MATAJI: Yeah, it's not pain.
SEEKER: No.

02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:27.000
SHRI MATAJI: Doesn't pain.

02:29:29.626 --> 02:29:31.292
See now, this finger has improved.

02:29:32.667 --> 02:29:35.834
[UNCLEAR] the doctors have cut some tendons, which has to grow.

02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:38.125
[Then you'll be all right]. It's much better now.

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:46.250
So much better, you see?

02:29:46.999 --> 02:29:49.042
SEEKER: It seems like.
SHRI MATAJI: Good. Aah, it's good.

02:29:49.584 --> 02:29:51.334
It's also opened out quite a lot.

02:29:52.209 --> 02:29:53.834
That one has opened out much more.

02:29:54.918 --> 02:29:58.209
This one is, I think, it's the doctor has cut a tendon there.

02:30:01.667 --> 02:30:02.167
(To the awaiting seekers) Come along.

02:30:07.334 --> 02:30:11.999
Sahaja Yogis can put their fingers on this and can cure it, it's not difficult. Come along.

02:30:11.999 --> 02:30:12.999
(Another seeker approaches)

02:30:12.999 --> 02:30:13.959
Now, what is it?

02:30:16.667 --> 02:30:19.834
Are you all right? She's got it? Aha, great!

02:30:20.501 --> 02:30:23.042
That's what Christ has said that you are to be born again.

02:30:28.042 --> 02:30:29.999
Is a real baptism, real one.

02:30:31.292 --> 02:30:33.083
(Putting Her fingers on the seeker's Sahasrara) Here. You can feel it.

02:30:37.292 --> 02:30:37.709
Good.

02:30:55.125 --> 02:30:55.792
What she say?

02:30:55.999 --> 02:31:01.542
YOGI: Her left side is shorter than the right side, she had an operation in the…

02:31:03.834 --> 02:31:07.626
(Pointing at the seeker's left arm) This one is… has no… no joint inside.

02:31:07.834 --> 02:31:08.709
SHRI MATAJI: They removed it?

02:31:08.709 --> 02:31:09.083
YOGI: Yes.

02:31:11.042 --> 02:31:12.042
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR].

02:31:12.042 --> 02:31:12.751
YOGI: Infection.

02:31:14.125 --> 02:31:15.709
SHRI MATAJI: They have put some… sort of a…

02:31:24.334 --> 02:31:26.209
But they have put some steel or something?

02:31:26.209 --> 02:31:27.125
YOGI: No, they put it out.

02:31:30.542 --> 02:31:31.626
There's nothing inside.

02:31:33.083 --> 02:31:33.542
SHRI MATAJI: What?!

02:31:35.375 --> 02:31:36.167
There's no bone?!

02:31:38.042 --> 02:31:40.542
YOGI: She can't rise it up like this, but she can move it.

02:31:41.584 --> 02:31:42.792
But she can't put it like this.

02:31:42.751 --> 02:31:43.167
SHRI MATAJI: Why?

02:31:44.125 --> 02:31:44.999
What happened to you?

02:31:47.042 --> 02:31:51.584
YOGI: The joint [UNCLEAR] [at this point] is gone, nothing inside, neither this nor this.

02:31:51.918 --> 02:31:52.959
SHRI MATAJI: Really?
YOGI: Yes.

02:31:54.751 --> 02:31:55.083
SHRI MATAJI: Why?

02:31:55.834 --> 02:31:58.834
YOGI: It was an infection somehow, and they made an operation.

02:31:59.542 --> 02:32:01.709
They removed it in her childhood, Shri Mataji.

02:32:03.792 --> 02:32:05.125
SHRI MATAJI: Then how can we cure you?

02:32:08.459 --> 02:32:11.417
YOGI: Same thing she has here, but there is metal inside, Shri Mataji.

02:32:13.417 --> 02:32:15.334
She can rise it like this but no further.

02:32:16.375 --> 02:32:17.918
SHRI MATAJI: Nothing can't help now this.

02:32:19.542 --> 02:32:21.626
It's all right, doesn't matter, you have got your realization.

02:32:23.083 --> 02:32:24.042
YOGI: She is happy anyway. (Laughter)

02:32:26.792 --> 02:32:29.959
SHRI MATAJI: (To another seeker) Now, how are the [UNCLEAR]? You've got it? Mm?

02:32:29.959 --> 02:32:32.000
SEEKER: I've felt it a little bit [UNCLEAR].

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.209
SHRI MATAJI: Ah, may God bless you!

02:32:33.209 --> 02:32:35.709
Now, you [must] [UNCLEAR], come and see them.

02:32:36.334 --> 02:32:38.292
Try to improve it. [UNCLEAR]?

02:32:38.292 --> 02:32:38.792
SEEKER: Uh-huh.

02:32:39.083 --> 02:32:41.501
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR]? You come and see these people.

02:32:41.751 --> 02:32:43.292
[UNCLEAR], now is better.

02:32:44.709 --> 02:32:45.459
Much more now?

02:32:45.918 --> 02:32:46.417
SEEKER: Uh-huh.

02:32:48.250 --> 02:32:50.250
(Shri Mataji works on the seeker's Agnya and then puts Her right thumb on the seeker's Hamsa)

02:33:30.042 --> 02:33:32.501
SHRI MATAJI: Forgive. Forgive everyone.

02:33:40.125 --> 02:33:40.667
SEEKER: It's hot.

02:33:41.501 --> 02:33:42.999
YOGI: Very hot, is it hot?

02:33:42.999 --> 02:33:45.125
SEEKER: Not hot, it's difficult to say.

02:33:45.959 --> 02:33:47.999
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, you see, there's nothing…

02:33:47.999 --> 02:33:51.042
SEEKER: [For me] because I'm protesting against it.

02:33:51.250 --> 02:33:52.709
[UNCLEAR] no, I don't think so.

02:33:52.709 --> 02:33:58.834
SHRI MATAJI: No, no. You see, now, you have to say that "Whether I forgive or I don't forgive, I don't do anything."

02:33:58.834 --> 02:33:59.876
It is a myth, isn't it?

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.626
But if you don't forgive, then you are torturing yourself.

02:34:03.584 --> 02:34:04.751
You better say, "I forgive."

02:34:06.292 --> 02:34:07.250
SEEKER: Mother, I forgive.

02:34:09.792 --> 02:34:10.209
SHRI MATAJI: Say it.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.167
SEEKER: Mother, I forgive.

02:34:15.584 --> 02:34:16.167
SHRI MATAJI: Again say.

02:34:17.876 --> 02:34:18.959
SEEKER: Mother, I forgive.

02:34:21.709 --> 02:34:22.334
SHRI MATAJI: Now is better?

02:34:22.542 --> 02:34:22.959
SEEKER: Uh-huh.

02:34:23.375 --> 02:34:23.959
SHRI MATAJI: See now?

02:34:24.459 --> 02:34:24.918
SEEKER: Uh-huh.

02:34:25.459 --> 02:34:28.417
SHRI MATAJI: You are not going to miss your Self-realization for that.

02:34:29.334 --> 02:34:30.334
You better forgive.

02:34:30.334 --> 02:34:30.918
SEEKER: OK.

02:34:31.876 --> 02:34:32.918
SHRI MATAJI: [And give up] [UNCLEAR].

02:34:34.375 --> 02:34:36.375
(Another seeker approaches)

02:34:36.375 --> 02:34:38.542
So, how was it? Fine?

02:34:46.083 --> 02:34:47.209
(To yogi) [UNCLEAR].

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.042
(Another seeker approaches)

02:34:52.042 --> 02:34:52.626
How are you?

02:34:55.918 --> 02:34:57.375
YOGI: She is very [UNCLEAR], Shri Mataji.

02:34:58.999 --> 02:34:59.584
Inside.

02:35:00.209 --> 02:35:01.083
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR]?

02:35:04.167 --> 02:35:06.667
YOGI: [UNCLEAR], Shri Mataji, [UNCLEAR].

02:35:08.584 --> 02:35:09.999
SHRI MATAJI: From what country are you from?

02:35:14.876 --> 02:35:17.334
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] Germany and Italy.

02:35:20.417 --> 02:35:21.501
She's born in Munich.

02:35:22.042 --> 02:35:22.834
SHRI MATAJI: Come forward.

02:35:25.167 --> 02:35:27.167
(Shri Mataji starts working on the seeker's Agnya)

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:34.999
What work you do?

02:35:38.375 --> 02:35:40.250
YOGI: She's not working at the moment, Shri Mataji.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
(Shri Mataji puts Her hand on the seeker's Sahasrara)

02:36:26.167 --> 02:36:28.083
She feels like taking off, Shri Mataji.

02:36:28.083 --> 02:36:28.626
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

02:36:28.626 --> 02:36:30.542
YOGI: She feels like taking off a little bit.

02:36:39.334 --> 02:36:41.334
SHRI MATAJI: Good! That's why you are feeling so light.

02:36:43.042 --> 02:36:44.542
Her potential is wonderful.

02:36:48.626 --> 02:36:50.834
YOGI: What can she do about feeling tired?

02:36:50.834 --> 02:36:55.999
SHRI MATAJI: Now you won't feel. Put your hand there (puts the seeker's right hand on the seeker's heart), and you have to say, "Mother, I am the spirit," that's all.

02:36:57.459 --> 02:36:58.417
"I am the spirit."

02:37:08.834 --> 02:37:12.292
"Mother" — I am your Mother — [UNCLEAR].

02:37:14.626 --> 02:37:15.334
All right.

02:37:15.959 --> 02:37:17.334
YOGI: Strong back Agnya also.

02:37:19.292 --> 02:37:21.834
SHRI MATAJI: Now? Better?

02:37:25.959 --> 02:37:27.000
This is your mantra.

02:37:27.334 --> 02:37:29.042
That's what you [need], all right?

02:37:29.834 --> 02:37:36.792
Keep your eyes low, on the ground, don't pay too much attention on the sides.

02:37:53.167 --> 02:37:58.459
Try to keep it down, about three feet [UNCLEAR] not too much.

02:37:59.042 --> 02:38:00.918
That's why you catch [UNCLEAR].

02:38:02.167 --> 02:38:03.167
Huh? Good?

02:38:04.167 --> 02:38:05.167
And you won't be tired.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:06.834
Come and see them.

02:38:06.834 --> 02:38:07.751
(Another seeker approaches)

02:38:07.751 --> 02:38:09.125
So what happened? Did you get it?

02:38:09.834 --> 02:38:10.250
SEEKER: No.

02:38:10.250 --> 02:38:10.876
SHRI MATAJI: You should.

02:38:13.584 --> 02:38:14.375
What's the matter? (Starts working on the seeker's left hand)

02:38:16.667 --> 02:38:17.667
What work you do?

02:38:19.292 --> 02:38:21.584
SEEKER: I have no… I don't know.

02:38:22.167 --> 02:38:23.042
SHRI MATAJI: Don't do any work?

02:38:23.834 --> 02:38:25.000
SEEKER: [UNCLEAR].

02:38:26.209 --> 02:38:29.209
I [UNCLEAR]. I want to study dancing.

02:38:29.584 --> 02:38:31.584
YOGI: He wants to study dancing, Shri Mataji.

02:38:35.083 --> 02:38:36.501
SHRI MATAJI: What dancing you want to study?

02:39:00.584 --> 02:39:02.459
There's no shaking now in your hands.

02:39:03.459 --> 02:39:04.792
Now, do you feel it now?

02:39:05.334 --> 02:39:05.959
SEEKER: I don't know.

02:39:06.042 --> 02:39:07.334
SHRI MATAJI: (Working on both the hands) Do you feel the cool breeze?

02:39:08.918 --> 02:39:09.876
SEEKER: Little bit.

02:39:16.042 --> 02:39:18.459
SHRI MATAJI: Are you keeping all right? Is your health all right?

02:39:19.751 --> 02:39:22.375
SEEKER: My spin is a little bit turned to right.

02:39:23.209 --> 02:39:25.792
YOGI: His spin is a little bit turned to the right. Spine.

02:39:25.751 --> 02:39:26.459
SEEKER: My spine.

02:39:26.834 --> 02:39:27.667
YOGI: Turned to the right.

02:39:27.999 --> 02:39:33.999
SEEKER: So my nerves… are pressed at the back.

02:39:37.667 --> 02:39:39.334
[UNCLEAR].

02:39:40.375 --> 02:39:43.334
SHRI MATAJI: How did you bend? How did it go that side?

02:39:43.334 --> 02:39:53.751
SEEKER: I don't know; my doctor said first I was [scrawny] when I was a small boy, always [stuff] on one side, very heavy [stuff]. So…

02:40:04.042 --> 02:40:04.626
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

02:40:16.999 --> 02:40:18.999
So. It's all right, doesn't matter.

02:40:19.167 --> 02:40:23.292
You'll have to go to do any treatment they'll tell you; you will be perfectly all right. All right?

02:40:23.459 --> 02:40:27.250
The shaking has to go away. All right? You see My point, don't you?

02:40:27.375 --> 02:40:28.918
You go and see, seriously.

02:40:29.083 --> 02:40:31.000
You go and see them and [UNCLEAR].

02:40:31.375 --> 02:40:32.709
All right? May God bless you!

02:40:32.709 --> 02:40:33.334
SEEKER: OK.

02:40:38.999 --> 02:40:40.999
(Another seeker approaches)

02:40:40.999 --> 02:40:42.167
SHRI MATAJI: So, how are you?

02:40:42.167 --> 02:40:44.167
YOGI: She is a Sahaja Yogini, Shri Mataji.
SHRI MATAJI: Even so.

02:41:16.876 --> 02:41:18.959
YOGI: The doctors removed her uterus.

02:41:19.292 --> 02:41:26.167
And since… ten years ago, and since [UNCLEAR] Sahaja Yoga her intestines took the place of the uterus.

02:41:26.292 --> 02:41:29.250
And now the doctors want to make operation to remove…

02:41:43.292 --> 02:41:47.292
SHRI MATAJI: That's the place of… of vacuum, so they have settled down there.

02:41:47.751 --> 02:41:54.709
YOGI: No, the intestines moved on herself on this place, without any influence of the doctors.

02:41:54.667 --> 02:41:58.459
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, but… all right, but do you have any problem with [UNCLEAR]?

02:42:20.042 --> 02:42:25.542
YOGI: She is asking if it's going away by itself or if it's need something.

02:42:26.292 --> 02:42:28.876
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, it doesn't need anything, you see, [that's|there's] a [UNCLEAR].

02:42:29.125 --> 02:42:31.375
The Kundalini must have taken its place there.

02:42:31.584 --> 02:42:34.209
It's all right, doesn't matter, as long you have no problem.

02:42:38.083 --> 02:42:39.792
YOGI: No operation?
SHRI MATAJI: No.

02:42:42.042 --> 02:42:42.918
YOGI: She's quite good.

02:42:43.375 --> 02:42:44.417
SHRI MATAJI: She's good.

02:42:44.417 --> 02:42:45.542
(Another seeker approaches)

02:42:45.542 --> 02:42:46.959
Yes, so, how are you?

02:42:47.417 --> 02:42:48.083
SEEKER: Fine, thanks.

02:42:48.167 --> 02:42:49.334
SHRI MATAJI: Did you feel the cool breeze?

02:42:49.459 --> 02:42:50.834
SEEKER: No, I don't think so.

02:42:56.918 --> 02:42:57.667
SHRI MATAJI: Did you forgive?

02:43:03.667 --> 02:43:05.125
SEEKER: I try the best I can.

02:43:05.584 --> 02:43:08.042
SHRI MATAJI: What is there to try, it's a myth, [I tell you]!

02:43:09.667 --> 02:43:10.959
[UNCLEAR], it's a myth.

02:43:14.667 --> 02:43:18.626
What is there to try to do? You just say it, [UNCLEAR].

You have to forgive.

All right, say: "I forgive everyone."

02:52:22.167 --> 02:52:22.542

YOGI: She is the mother of Gunther, Shri Mataji. (Laughter)

02:54:59.667 --> 02:55:00.417
SHRI MATAJI: Aah?!

02:55:00.417 --> 02:55:01.417

02:55:37.125 --> 02:55:37.792
SEEKER: I'll be honest.

02:55:40.834 --> 02:55:41.792
It means too much.

02:55:43.667 --> 02:55:45.167
SHRI MATAJI: Just say: "Mother, cure my neck."

02:55:46.417 --> 02:55:48.042
Left Swadhishthana [UNCLEAR].

02:55:49.792 --> 02:55:52.667
Have you been to some guru? [UNCLEAR] she must have been to some guru or someone?

02:56:04.459 --> 02:56:05.042

02:56:15.751 --> 02:56:16.209

I am… do You…

02:56:28.584 --> 02:56:30.459
YOGI: She does breathing therapies.

02:56:32.375 --> 02:56:34.167
SHRI MATAJI: [No]. See, the truth…

02:56:36.501 --> 02:56:40.834
Your… just, you see, this (circles the base of the seeker's left thumb) blocked; see, this is [always] blocked (circles the base of the seeker's right thumb).

02:56:41.999 --> 02:56:43.959
Both the Swadhishthanas are [blocked].

02:56:49.042 --> 02:56:51.542
It's clear? All right.

02:56:51.876 --> 02:56:53.250
Now, [that's not good].

02:56:53.792 --> 02:56:57.417
You have to get these cured first of all. Both the Swadhishthanas are blocked.

02:57:04.918 --> 02:57:05.667
[UNCLEAR] [for that].

02:57:08.834 --> 02:57:14.584
First you must become one with the Divine, you must master the knowledge, and then you…

02:57:14.834 --> 02:57:16.626
Before that, I [UNCLEAR].

02:57:34.459 --> 02:57:35.334
That's why you have this.

02:57:37.292 --> 02:57:38.000

And the problem I have [UNCLEAR] since the child, but not yet.

02:57:47.167 --> 02:57:53.709
SHRI MATAJI: No, but that [UNCLEAR] what you have cannot be cured unless and until you cure these things.

02:58:03.042 --> 02:58:04.042
All right, let Me try.

02:58:04.042 --> 02:58:06.042
(Shri Mataji stays concentrated for a while)

02:58:36.834 --> 02:58:37.501
Now let's see.

02:58:38.876 --> 02:58:39.918
Feeling the cool breeze?

02:58:39.918 --> 02:58:41.792
(The seeker nods in the affirmative)

02:58:41.792 --> 02:58:45.000
Better? All right. Now see your neck. Move it.

02:58:46.751 --> 02:58:47.292
Better now?

02:58:47.292 --> 02:58:48.459

02:58:48.459 --> 02:58:49.918
SHRI MATAJI: Better? All right.

02:58:50.042 --> 02:58:53.417
So, I worked out through My own Kundalini, all right?

02:58:53.792 --> 02:58:55.876
Now, you have to master it.

02:58:56.417 --> 02:59:00.999
First master it, get yourself all right, and then you have to do this way.

02:59:01.834 --> 02:59:02.292
All right?

02:59:13.334 --> 02:59:15.375
(Another seeker approaches)

02:59:15.375 --> 02:59:16.334
So, how are you?

02:59:17.751 --> 02:59:18.999

02:59:45.918 --> 02:59:48.125
Just say: "Mother, I am the spirit."

02:59:50.918 --> 02:59:52.751
(To yogi) Tell her to say "I am the spirit," all right?

02:59:52.999 --> 02:59:55.083
"I am the spirit" — just say it.

03:00:08.125 --> 03:00:08.584
Now?

03:00:11.417 --> 03:00:13.167
This is your mantra, all right?

03:00:20.876 --> 03:00:22.876
(Another seeker approaches)

03:00:22.876 --> 03:00:24.042
Did you feel the cool breeze?

03:00:24.167 --> 03:00:24.792
SEEKER: Yes.

03:00:24.792 --> 03:00:25.959
SHRI MATAJI: Good. You are all right.

03:00:27.334 --> 03:00:28.542
You have to master it.

03:00:29.042 --> 03:00:30.751
You must come to them. (To yogi) She's very good.

03:00:32.417 --> 03:00:33.334
May God bless you!

03:00:35.125 --> 03:00:36.125
And you must learn it!

03:00:36.751 --> 03:00:39.834
And you should master it, all right? And you should be all right.

03:00:40.334 --> 03:00:41.167
She's happy! (Laughter)

03:00:42.918 --> 03:00:44.209
So [UNCLEAR]!

03:00:45.125 --> 03:00:45.834
It's all right.

03:00:45.834 --> 03:00:47.834
(Another seeker approaches)

03:00:52.751 --> 03:00:53.918
Felt it, the cool breeze?

03:00:54.083 --> 03:00:54.876
SEEKER: I feel dizzy.

03:00:56.209 --> 03:00:56.584
SHRI MATAJI: Now?

03:01:08.999 --> 03:01:10.459
[UNCLEAR]. Better now?

03:01:10.834 --> 03:01:11.918
SEEKER: Now it's better.

03:01:15.417 --> 03:01:18.834
SHRI MATAJI: Come and see them. You are dizzy, they'll put it right, all right?

03:01:22.250 --> 03:01:24.250
(Another seeker approaches)

03:01:24.250 --> 03:01:24.751
Come along.

03:01:29.042 --> 03:01:31.125
So, felt it?

03:01:35.876 --> 03:01:37.042
YOGI: He is not sure, Shri Mataji.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:37.751
SHRI MATAJI: Not sure.

03:01:47.250 --> 03:01:48.125
(To yogi) Raise [UNCLEAR].

03:02:04.501 --> 03:02:07.542
Ha! Now? Felt it?

03:02:09.459 --> 03:02:11.709
Cool breeze? All right?

03:02:13.626 --> 03:02:15.375
(To yogi) Huh? Too much?

03:02:22.834 --> 03:02:23.417
What's he say?

03:02:23.417 --> 03:02:25.792
YOGI: He feels something, but he doesn't know what it is.

03:02:25.792 --> 03:02:26.876
SHRI MATAJI: It's the cool breeze.

03:02:29.042 --> 03:02:31.250
YOGI: Now he feels it more warm, Shri Mataji, more warm.

03:02:31.250 --> 03:02:34.209
SHRI MATAJI: More warm. All right?
YOGI: It's coming hot [UNCLEAR].

03:02:39.792 --> 03:02:40.250
SHRI MATAJI: Now?

03:02:45.042 --> 03:02:45.709
Now cooler?

03:02:48.626 --> 03:02:49.209
Better now?

03:02:49.834 --> 03:02:50.459
SEEKER: Now it's cool. (Laughter)

03:02:51.417 --> 03:02:52.375
SHRI MATAJI: Now it's cool, yeah? (Laughs)

03:02:55.209 --> 03:02:56.584
Put this hand on your heart.

03:02:56.959 --> 03:02:59.000
Just say: "Mother, I am the spirit," that's all.

03:03:08.626 --> 03:03:10.876
Are you wearing something in your neck? Nothing?

03:03:11.751 --> 03:03:13.751
Now say: "Mother, I am the spirit."

03:03:13.792 --> 03:03:15.167
SEEKER: Shri Mataji, I am the spirit.

03:03:15.167 --> 03:03:15.709
SHRI MATAJI: Again.

03:03:15.918 --> 03:03:18.918
(The seeker continues repeating the words)

03:03:25.083 --> 03:03:25.834
Better now?

03:03:27.125 --> 03:03:28.083
One say, one more.

03:03:28.584 --> 03:03:29.667
SEEKER: Mother, I am the spirit.

03:03:33.042 --> 03:03:37.000
SHRI MATAJI: See? Feel it now? Much cooler. All right? May God bless you!

03:03:37.918 --> 03:03:39.876
Now, come and cool others also! (Laughter)

03:03:47.918 --> 03:03:49.792
(Another seeker approaches)

03:03:49.792 --> 03:03:50.709
You didn't feel it?

03:04:02.999 --> 03:04:07.334
Just say: "Mother, I am the spirit."

03:04:08.751 --> 03:04:11.751
(The seeker continues repeating the words)

03:04:33.083 --> 03:04:34.292
(To yogi) Right to the left carry on.

03:04:37.834 --> 03:04:38.792
Are you a Catholic?

03:04:40.209 --> 03:04:41.459
SEEKER: Yes, I am a Catholic.

03:04:41.751 --> 03:04:42.375
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

03:04:42.375 --> 03:04:43.459
SEEKER: I am born as Catholic.

03:04:43.417 --> 03:04:45.626
SHRI MATAJI: (To yogi) Acchha (good), now ask him [UNCLEAR].

03:04:49.626 --> 03:04:51.959
(The seeker asks the question in German)

03:04:52.167 --> 03:04:54.667
Again. Ask again.

03:04:54.999 --> 03:04:57.999
(The seeker continues repeating the question)

03:05:06.125 --> 03:05:07.375
Feeling the cool breeze now?

03:05:07.876 --> 03:05:08.918
SEEKER: I feel better.

03:05:08.918 --> 03:05:10.959
SHRI MATAJI: Aha! Now you say: "You are…"

03:05:13.167 --> 03:05:18.167
(The seeker continues repeating the words)

03:05:32.250 --> 03:05:32.876
All right?

03:05:33.167 --> 03:05:34.709
SEEKER: I think I think too much. (Laughter)

03:05:36.999 --> 03:05:39.459
YOGI: He thinks too much. He thinks he thinks too much.

03:05:40.209 --> 03:05:40.792
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

03:05:40.792 --> 03:05:45.751
(Shri Mataji works on the seeker's Agnya)

03:05:55.125 --> 03:05:56.876
Now you can't think, can you?

03:06:02.167 --> 03:06:03.959
YOGI: He looks quite [UNCLEAR], Shri Mataji.

03:06:04.667 --> 03:06:05.250
He's better.

03:06:07.959 --> 03:06:10.125
SHRI MATAJI: What about this? Feeling the cool breeze?

03:06:14.334 --> 03:06:15.167
SEEKER: I think yeah.

03:06:15.417 --> 03:06:17.250
SHRI MATAJI: You can't think, why are you thinking?

03:06:21.918 --> 03:06:22.667
YOGI: Close your eyes.

03:06:30.125 --> 03:06:30.959
SHRI MATAJI: There's no thought.

03:06:34.626 --> 03:06:35.959
Better now, on the hand?

03:06:37.334 --> 03:06:38.626
Left side [UNCLEAR].

03:06:40.250 --> 03:06:41.876
You've been to some guru or someone?

03:06:42.417 --> 03:06:43.626
SEEKER: No, I haven't.

03:06:43.626 --> 03:06:44.083
SHRI MATAJI: Never?

03:06:47.584 --> 03:06:48.292
It's weird.

03:07:22.042 --> 03:07:22.751
Better now?

03:07:24.417 --> 03:07:25.709
SEEKER: Yeah, it's felt better.
SHRI MATAJI: Good.

03:07:26.709 --> 03:07:28.417
See now? Worked out.

03:07:35.417 --> 03:07:40.083
Good. Now, you have to come and practice, all right, and establish it, all right?

03:07:44.584 --> 03:07:46.626
(Another seeker approaches)

03:07:46.626 --> 03:07:47.792
Welcome, how are you?

03:07:48.876 --> 03:07:49.375
Good!

03:07:53.918 --> 03:07:55.792
Excellent! May God bless you!

03:07:59.209 --> 03:08:01.209
(Another seeker approaches)

03:08:01.209 --> 03:08:02.375
YOGINI: It's my grandmother.

03:08:02.584 --> 03:08:03.125
SHRI MATAJI: Your…?

03:08:03.083 --> 03:08:04.417
YOGINI: My grandmother.

03:08:04.417 --> 03:08:06.999
SHRI MATAJI: I see! Look at her!

03:08:08.999 --> 03:08:12.751
Aah, [she must have a lot of wisdom]. Don't you?

03:08:17.999 --> 03:08:19.125
YOGI: She felt it, Shri Mataji.

03:08:22.334 --> 03:08:25.292
SHRI MATAJI: All right, she is all right. May God bless you!

03:08:33.584 --> 03:08:35.584
(Another seeker approaches)

03:08:35.584 --> 03:08:36.792
Did you feel the cool breeze?

03:08:38.459 --> 03:08:40.751
Huh? What are you following?

03:08:41.459 --> 03:08:42.375
SEEKER: What am I following?

03:08:43.834 --> 03:08:46.626
Oh, that's… I wanted to ask You actually, but just…

03:08:47.417 --> 03:08:53.083
What do You think… You think it's good to do Hatha Yoga, any different yogas?

03:08:58.584 --> 03:09:00.918
SHRI MATAJI: You see… What, Hatha Yoga?

03:09:01.959 --> 03:09:04.459
SEEKER: Yes, for example. And any different yogas.

03:09:04.417 --> 03:09:12.999
SHRI MATAJI: You see, whatever you'll require, we'll tell you, all right? Depending on the obstruction in your centres, all right?

03:09:13.167 --> 03:09:16.125
It should not be taken at random, it's a science, you see?

03:09:16.417 --> 03:09:20.667
Supposing you have a problem on a particular centre, then we'll tell you, "Do this."

03:09:21.167 --> 03:09:24.834
But just don't do at random. You are following My point?

03:09:25.626 --> 03:09:28.918
SEEKER: I shouldn't attend to many…

03:09:29.417 --> 03:09:32.459
SHRI MATAJI: No, you should give up everything. You should give up everything.

03:09:32.459 --> 03:09:35.626
Let your Kundalini [through] properly, all right? Feel it.

03:09:35.626 --> 03:09:37.959
Because you are a seeker, you see, you're seeking the truth.

03:09:37.959 --> 03:09:40.334
You find it first of all, establish it.

03:09:40.626 --> 03:09:43.626
If you have any problem, then we'll tell you what is to be done.

03:09:43.876 --> 03:09:47.000
Normally, [I think] [UNCLEAR], you shouldn't worry about it.

03:09:51.083 --> 03:09:53.209
Now, look after because you are a seeker.

03:09:53.626 --> 03:09:56.250
Now, don't miss it for anything, all right?

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:58.584
You come and see them in the centre.

03:10:07.375 --> 03:10:09.375
(Another seeker approaches)

03:10:09.375 --> 03:10:10.209
YOGI: She is a Sahaja Yogini.

03:10:13.209 --> 03:10:14.000
SHRI MATAJI: What's the matter?

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:15.083
YOGI: She has an Agnya problem.

03:10:15.999 --> 03:10:16.459
SHRI MATAJI: Agnya? (Laughs)

03:10:22.542 --> 03:10:24.667
What sort of Agnya problem you have?

03:10:25.375 --> 03:10:27.834
YOGI: She sees light something sometimes, Shri Mataji.

03:10:28.959 --> 03:10:29.417
SHRI MATAJI: Really?

03:10:31.334 --> 03:10:32.959
You went to some guru or someone?

03:10:36.125 --> 03:10:36.792
SEEKER: Reiki.

03:10:36.792 --> 03:10:38.834
YOGI: Reiki, she made Reiki, Shri Mataji.

03:10:38.834 --> 03:10:39.459
SHRI MATAJI: What's that?

03:10:40.417 --> 03:10:43.709
YOGI: If You… I don't know too much about Reiki, but it's something…

03:10:50.125 --> 03:10:57.834
She was dealing with cosmic energies and transmitting cosmic energies to other people, and holding hands, and transmit that energy flow…

03:10:57.834 --> 03:10:59.292
SHRI MATAJI: [From below] did you do that.

03:11:10.918 --> 03:11:11.584
(Holding a candle before Her bindi) You watch here.

03:11:53.459 --> 03:11:54.083
Now better?

03:11:59.125 --> 03:12:00.292
She sees anything?

03:12:00.918 --> 03:12:03.584
YOGI: She only sees it when she closes her eyes, Shri Mataji.

03:12:03.584 --> 03:12:04.334
SHRI MATAJI: Close your eyes.

03:12:11.751 --> 03:12:13.334
YOGI: It's still there, Shri Mataji, she says.

03:12:13.751 --> 03:12:14.417
SHRI MATAJI: What is it?

03:12:23.876 --> 03:12:25.250
YOGI: It's flickering, Shri Mataji.

03:12:25.584 --> 03:12:26.125
SHRI MATAJI: What?

03:12:26.125 --> 03:12:28.959
YOGI: Light flickering, she sees flickering light, Shri Mataji.

03:12:30.250 --> 03:12:32.042
SHRI MATAJI: Close your eyes tight, very tight.

03:12:41.626 --> 03:12:42.334
Now better?

03:12:44.584 --> 03:12:47.626
Again, press your… press your eyes.

03:12:47.584 --> 03:12:48.876
YOGI: It's getting better, Shri Mataji.

03:12:51.709 --> 03:12:52.584
SHRI MATAJI: Press your eyes.

03:13:05.209 --> 03:13:08.000
Ah! Better, no?

03:13:12.417 --> 03:13:13.459
YOGI: It's better, Shri Mataji.

03:13:24.542 --> 03:13:25.209
SHRI MATAJI: Better now?

03:13:26.209 --> 03:13:26.918
SEEKER: Yeah.

03:13:27.250 --> 03:13:32.292
SHRI MATAJI: Now, so you put the photograph; before the photograph you put like this (holds a candle against Her Agnya), just close your eyes.

03:13:33.125 --> 03:13:36.751
Without [UNCLEAR]. It's much better now. All right? May God bless you!

03:13:38.125 --> 03:13:40.125
(Another seeker approaches)

03:13:40.125 --> 03:13:41.334
YOGI: She was a Sahaja Yogini.

03:13:41.999 --> 03:13:42.542
SHRI MATAJI: Who?

03:13:42.542 --> 03:13:44.542
YOGI: She didn't come for one year or one and a half years.

03:13:44.542 --> 03:13:45.125
SHRI MATAJI: This one?

03:13:46.834 --> 03:13:47.918
You are a Sahaja Yogini?

03:13:49.042 --> 03:13:50.417
Then you did come to Me.

03:13:52.751 --> 03:13:53.375
What happened?

03:14:04.709 --> 03:14:11.542
YOGI: She comes to ask about her husband, who had an appendix operation and he completely lost his balance, Shri Mataji.

03:14:13.167 --> 03:14:15.999
SHRI MATAJI: Completely lost his balance? He can't walk?

03:14:16.167 --> 03:14:18.584
SEEKER: Yeah. No, not very good.

03:14:19.167 --> 03:14:21.459
YOGI: Not very good, Shri Mataji, he can't walk very good.

03:14:26.918 --> 03:14:32.167
It was an appendix breakthrough, Shri Mataji, crash. Appendix… the appendix broke through.

03:14:32.542 --> 03:14:34.417
SHRI MATAJI: Ah! Then he was operated?

03:14:34.501 --> 03:14:46.375
SEEKER: Yes. The operation went… went long, three and a half hour or four hour, like this, and so… because of this, till too long…

03:14:46.375 --> 03:14:47.876
SHRI MATAJI: But you are a Sahaja Yogini, aren't you?

03:14:48.584 --> 03:14:48.959
SEEKER: Yes.

03:14:49.584 --> 03:14:51.334
SHRI MATAJI: So you come for Sahaja Yoga, do you?

03:14:52.250 --> 03:15:01.334
SEEKER: Yeah, I… I'm… it was difficult to come for me, but I still… I don't know why it…

03:15:01.334 --> 03:15:04.334
YOGI: She found it difficult to come in last year, Shri Mataji.

03:15:04.501 --> 03:15:05.751
SHRI MATAJI: That should not be such.

03:15:06.584 --> 03:15:11.834
You see, you should try to come, all of you, otherwise these things happen, you see?

03:15:11.834 --> 03:15:15.209
Now, is your husband a realized soul?

03:15:16.626 --> 03:15:18.918
SEEKER: Yeah. He was here last year.

03:15:20.918 --> 03:15:23.918
YOGI: She came… he came to Your program last year, her husband.

03:15:23.918 --> 03:15:25.209
SHRI MATAJI: But he never came after that?

03:15:25.209 --> 03:15:27.083
YOGI: But he never was in Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji.

03:15:28.918 --> 03:15:32.542
SEEKER: No, he wasn't [good] at the same time, twice, but he…

03:15:32.667 --> 03:15:40.999
SHRI MATAJI: You have to be under Mother's… Mother's sari, isn't it? To be looked after, that you are protected.

03:15:41.667 --> 03:15:43.667
(The seeker tries to touch Shri Mataji's sari)

03:15:43.667 --> 03:15:44.250
YOGI: No, no, no, no.

03:15:45.459 --> 03:15:47.709
SHRI MATAJI: Touch it, doesn't matter. Touch it.

03:15:48.626 --> 03:15:49.042
Touch it.

03:15:49.042 --> 03:15:54.042
(The seeker holds Shri Mataji's sari with both hands)

03:15:59.375 --> 03:15:59.876
All right?

03:16:00.584 --> 03:16:03.501
So you have to be there all the time, you must see them.

03:16:04.292 --> 03:16:10.083
Put your left hand on the stomach like that and right hand towards the photograph.

03:16:10.834 --> 03:16:14.125
Then ask: "Mother, please cure my husband," if you're all right.

03:16:14.542 --> 03:16:16.125
But you must attend this.

03:16:16.375 --> 03:16:19.834
If you go out of the protection of Mother, then what can I do?

03:16:21.375 --> 03:16:25.292
All right? You should join them. Take you husband also there.

03:16:26.709 --> 03:16:29.959
Otherwise there can be another calamity, I don't know what will happen.

03:16:30.792 --> 03:16:31.250
All right?

03:16:35.083 --> 03:16:37.125
(Another seeker approaches)

03:16:37.125 --> 03:16:37.542
No?

03:16:38.459 --> 03:16:41.250
YOGI: She also didn't come for half a year.

03:16:41.250 --> 03:16:42.709
SHRI MATAJI: Why is it? Come forward.

03:16:43.959 --> 03:16:45.334
What happened, why don't you come?

03:16:46.083 --> 03:16:49.501
SEEKER: I don't seem to be able to establish myself.

03:16:50.501 --> 03:16:53.792
SHRI MATAJI: No?
SEEKER: No. You know, but…

03:16:54.250 --> 03:16:55.459
SHRI MATAJI: But you love Me, isn't it?

03:16:57.125 --> 03:16:58.042
Or you don't love Me?

03:16:59.250 --> 03:17:00.083
SEEKER: I think I do.

03:17:00.584 --> 03:17:03.959
SHRI MATAJI: You do. Then it's all right. You're established.

03:17:03.918 --> 03:17:05.459
Just say: "Mother, come in my heart."

03:17:05.459 --> 03:17:08.792
Just… you have to just [remind]. [Whenever you say|Wherever you see], I will be.

03:17:08.792 --> 03:17:11.167
Just say: "Mother, please come in my heart."

03:17:11.167 --> 03:17:12.667
SEEKER: Mother, please come to my heart.

03:17:12.667 --> 03:17:13.167
SHRI MATAJI: Again.

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:19.000
(The seeker continues repeating the words)

03:17:22.584 --> 03:17:23.626
Now? [You done]?

03:17:24.959 --> 03:17:26.667
All right? That's what it is.

03:17:28.125 --> 03:17:32.542
Like, if you love Me, right there in the heart, then you are all right.

03:17:33.334 --> 03:17:34.125
(To somebody) Isn't it?

03:17:37.834 --> 03:17:38.209
See?

03:17:40.083 --> 03:17:46.751
And this… see, I'm doing this work, working so very hard, and you shouldn't give up like this.

03:17:47.042 --> 03:17:48.125
How can I do alone?

03:17:49.417 --> 03:17:51.751
You all have to support Me and help Me.

03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:55.501
All right?

03:17:57.083 --> 03:17:59.083
(Another seeker approaches)

03:17:59.083 --> 03:17:59.751
Come along.

03:18:00.999 --> 03:18:01.959
She is a Sahaja Yogini?

03:18:04.125 --> 03:18:05.542
Oh, may God bless you! Sit down.

03:18:06.375 --> 03:18:07.292
What have you been doing?

03:18:18.918 --> 03:18:19.459
All right.

03:18:19.876 --> 03:18:21.000
SEEKER: Nothing yoga I do.

03:18:21.250 --> 03:18:22.459
SHRI MATAJI: You haven't been doing?
SEEKER: No.

03:18:24.250 --> 03:18:25.375
SHRI MATAJI: You felt the cool breeze?

03:18:28.209 --> 03:18:29.334
YOGI: She felt it, Shri Mataji.

03:18:37.626 --> 03:18:38.125
SHRI MATAJI: Good!

03:18:39.999 --> 03:18:42.584
She's good. She's very humble.

03:18:46.417 --> 03:18:48.250
Mm, very good! Do you find?

03:18:48.667 --> 03:18:49.250
SEEKER: Yes.

03:18:49.667 --> 03:18:52.542
SHRI MATAJI: Now you've come to Sahaja Yoga, learn about it, all right?
SEEKER: Yes.

03:18:52.542 --> 03:18:53.667
SHRI MATAJI: Like to wear a sari?

03:18:54.209 --> 03:18:57.209
SEEKER: Yes. My husband is Indian, that's why.

03:18:57.209 --> 03:18:58.417
SHRI MATAJI: He is an Indian?
SEEKER: Yes.

03:18:58.667 --> 03:18:59.459
SHRI MATAJI: What is his name?

03:18:59.918 --> 03:19:01.000
SEEKER: [UNCLEAR].

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:02.209
SHRI MATAJI: Where is he? He's not come?

03:19:02.209 --> 03:19:03.876
SEEKER: No, he is at work.

03:19:04.292 --> 03:19:05.709
SHRI MATAJI: All right, doesn't matter.

03:19:05.834 --> 03:19:08.626
So now you also call him for Sahaja Yoga, all right?

03:19:08.626 --> 03:19:10.250
SEEKER: Yes, I'll do it.
SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you!

03:19:11.125 --> 03:19:12.334
YOGI: Come to another program.

03:19:12.334 --> 03:19:13.876
SHRI MATAJI: So her husband is an Indian.

03:19:14.584 --> 03:19:17.167
That's why she dresses all right. She looks like an Indian woman!

03:19:23.417 --> 03:19:25.417
(Another seeker approaches)

03:19:25.417 --> 03:19:26.667
You felt the cool breeze?

03:19:27.083 --> 03:19:27.584
SEEKER: No.

03:19:30.125 --> 03:19:32.083
SHRI MATAJI: Haven't been to any guru or anyone?

03:19:32.542 --> 03:19:33.375
SEEKER: No.
SHRI MATAJI: No.

03:19:34.999 --> 03:19:35.918
What work you do?

03:19:37.167 --> 03:19:39.542
YOGI: Student, Shri Mataji. (To the seeker) What are you studying?

03:19:40.209 --> 03:19:42.209
SEEKER: I work with mentally handicapped children.

03:19:42.417 --> 03:19:45.250
YOGI: She's working with mentally handicapped children, Shri Mataji.

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:51.999
SHRI MATAJI: It's not proper way.

03:19:54.292 --> 03:19:56.459
Because you don't know how to protect yourself.

03:20:04.459 --> 03:20:05.334
You'll have a catch.

03:20:08.459 --> 03:20:12.375
First you get your realization, establish yourself, to know what you could help.

03:20:12.626 --> 03:20:14.125
And then you put your hands.

03:20:14.250 --> 03:20:16.709
Otherwise would be dangerous [UNCLEAR].

03:20:17.417 --> 03:20:18.042
All right?

03:20:20.918 --> 03:20:22.375
So will you come and see them?

03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:28.542
SEEKER: Yes.

03:20:29.834 --> 03:20:32.209
SHRI MATAJI: You must first of all know what is this.

03:20:32.542 --> 03:20:38.083
First of all know yourself and [UNCLEAR], otherwise you've catching all their problems.

03:20:41.918 --> 03:20:42.334
All right?

03:20:44.209 --> 03:20:44.834
Better now?

03:20:51.667 --> 03:20:52.375
Better now.

03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:57.417
So, now, don't get into it. First of all, learn [UNCLEAR], all right?

03:21:05.167 --> 03:21:08.125
It's a very [UNCLEAR], it's a very [UNCLEAR].

03:21:08.999 --> 03:21:10.999
(A yogini approaches)

03:21:10.999 --> 03:21:12.792
How are you? What's the matter?

03:21:13.999 --> 03:21:14.876
You are all right now?

03:21:15.626 --> 03:21:17.042
YOGI: She looks better, Shri Mataji.

03:21:17.042 --> 03:21:17.542
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

03:21:17.542 --> 03:21:18.667
YOGI: She looks much better.

03:21:18.959 --> 03:21:20.042
SHRI MATAJI: She looks much better?

03:21:20.792 --> 03:21:21.709
Now, what are you doing?

03:21:22.834 --> 03:21:24.417
Just teaching [UNCLEAR]?

03:21:24.999 --> 03:21:26.292
YOGINI: I'm teaching, it's all right.

03:21:26.584 --> 03:21:27.083
SHRI MATAJI: Where?

03:21:27.834 --> 03:21:28.334
YOGINI: In the school.

03:21:28.918 --> 03:21:29.626
SHRI MATAJI: In the school?

03:21:29.834 --> 03:21:33.792
YOGINI: But — what's more important than this — but I'm doing transcriptions.

03:21:34.083 --> 03:21:37.000
Before I've taken some outside, and I've done it [UNCLEAR].

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:38.000
SHRI MATAJI: What transcriptions?

03:21:38.542 --> 03:21:39.125
YOGINI: Mozart.

03:21:39.918 --> 03:21:40.417
YOGI: Mozart.

03:21:40.959 --> 03:21:41.542
SHRI MATAJI: Mozart?!

03:21:41.834 --> 03:21:43.000
YOGI: You know who she is, Shri Mataji?

03:21:43.501 --> 03:21:44.167
SHRI MATAJI: I know her.

03:21:44.918 --> 03:21:46.459
But she's so much changed now.

03:21:47.959 --> 03:21:51.542
And very much changed, you're feeling so… changed [UNCLEAR].

03:21:54.999 --> 03:21:56.584
So, that's what Sahaja Yoga is.

03:21:57.959 --> 03:22:00.417
YOGINI: [I still] didn't come back, it's terrible, [You know].

03:22:00.876 --> 03:22:03.375
YOGI: She is little bit out of collective, Shri Mataji.

03:22:04.292 --> 03:22:04.751
SHRI MATAJI: Really?

03:22:04.751 --> 03:22:09.792
YOGINI: He would never let me back to the collective, he said that you… he said not to come back [UNCLEAR].

03:22:09.876 --> 03:22:12.751
SHRI MATAJI: Now she is all right. She's all right now.

03:22:15.959 --> 03:22:16.792
Now you are all right.

03:22:18.709 --> 03:22:19.042
Now.

03:22:19.042 --> 03:22:20.834
YOGI: She's asking about Frank, Shri Mataji.

03:22:21.042 --> 03:22:21.459
SHRI MATAJI: Who?

03:22:21.584 --> 03:22:23.209
YOGI: She is [UNCLEAR].
SHRI MATAJI: I know.

03:22:23.209 --> 03:22:28.876
YOGI: And she is married with Frank [UNCLEAR], but Frank is in England now, and she is asking what to do about it.

03:22:28.876 --> 03:22:29.999
Whether she could—

03:22:29.999 --> 03:22:30.751
SHRI MATAJI: You want him?

03:22:33.375 --> 03:22:34.250
Now forget it.

03:22:35.542 --> 03:22:36.792
He also doesn't want her.

03:22:39.250 --> 03:22:39.709
Mutual.

03:22:41.918 --> 03:22:43.459
He's doing very well, he's very…

03:22:44.667 --> 03:22:45.542
He's doing very well.

03:22:46.042 --> 03:22:49.626
He's very learned man, do you know that? Very well educated.

03:22:55.083 --> 03:22:58.125
I wish you could look after him, but it's all right.

03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:01.542
All right, you come back [UNCLEAR].

03:23:08.250 --> 03:23:10.250
(Another seeker approaches)

03:23:10.250 --> 03:23:12.542
Ah! So, how are you?

03:23:16.959 --> 03:23:18.125
YOGI: She didn't feel it, Shri Mataji.

03:23:26.542 --> 03:23:31.584
She has an… she had an accident and her… she has something with her knee, Shri Mataji.

03:23:32.167 --> 03:23:32.876
SHRI MATAJI: What was it?

03:23:36.417 --> 03:23:37.709
ANOTHER YOGI: It's called a rupture.

03:23:41.501 --> 03:23:44.667
ANOTHER YOGI: [UNCLEAR], Shri Mataji, [UNCLEAR].

03:23:46.083 --> 03:23:47.375
YOGI: The strings were…

03:23:50.626 --> 03:23:51.417
SHRI MATAJI: Tendons.

03:23:54.375 --> 03:23:55.292
From that [UNCLEAR].

03:23:56.125 --> 03:23:57.792
Have they removed anything from there?

03:24:00.834 --> 03:24:01.167
YOGI: No.

03:24:07.792 --> 03:24:08.501
SHRI MATAJI: So, is she married?

03:24:12.709 --> 03:24:14.834
YOGI: She's a… widow, Shri Mataji.

03:24:15.959 --> 03:24:16.584
SHRI MATAJI: You're a widow.

03:24:17.667 --> 03:24:18.709
You don't want to marry?

03:24:21.250 --> 03:24:22.000
Do you have children?

03:24:24.125 --> 03:24:25.125
YOGI: No children, Shri Mataji.

03:24:25.125 --> 03:24:27.542
SHRI MATAJI: No children. You would like to marry also?

03:24:28.709 --> 03:24:30.334
YOGI: Yes, Shri Mataji, she would like to marry.

03:24:31.834 --> 03:24:32.751
SHRI MATAJI: Put down [UNCLEAR].

03:24:37.459 --> 03:24:39.792
What was the accident? This one [UNCLEAR]?

03:24:40.417 --> 03:24:41.792
Stretch it, stretch it.

03:24:42.542 --> 03:24:43.542
What was the accident?

03:24:46.542 --> 03:24:47.792
YOGI: She was skiing, Shri Mataji.

03:24:52.834 --> 03:24:53.542
SHRI MATAJI: Now come forward.

03:24:54.125 --> 03:24:59.125
(Shri Mataji puts Her right foot on the seeker's knee)

03:24:59.792 --> 03:25:01.334
Skiing is not a good thing.

03:25:02.501 --> 03:25:04.959
So many I've seen that way, very young people.

03:25:37.501 --> 03:25:39.083
ANOTHER YOGI: Left Nabhi, strong left Nabhi.

03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:44.167
Also left Swadhishthana. Back Agnya.

03:25:44.709 --> 03:25:46.709
YOGI: Now she feels it, Shri Mataji, [UNCLEAR].

03:25:46.999 --> 03:25:47.709
SHRI MATAJI: Both the hands?

03:25:55.876 --> 03:25:58.042
YOGI: She feels it in both hands a little bit, Shri Mataji.

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000
(Shri Mataji stays concentrated for a while)

03:26:22.250 --> 03:26:22.751
SHRI MATAJI: Ha!

03:26:34.250 --> 03:26:35.542
Now feel it in the hands?

03:26:40.083 --> 03:26:40.918
Not in the hands?

03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:44.417
Don't think, don't think, watch Me without thinking.

03:26:44.417 --> 03:26:46.417
(Shri Mataji stays concentrated for a while)

03:27:02.918 --> 03:27:03.375
Ha!

03:27:04.709 --> 03:27:08.792
Now see. [UNCLEAR].

03:27:09.667 --> 03:27:10.334
Better now?

03:27:13.125 --> 03:27:14.209
YOGI: Much better, Shri Mataji.

03:27:16.667 --> 03:27:17.876
SHRI MATAJI: Now you come and join them.

03:27:28.542 --> 03:27:30.292
Much better? What she's said?

03:27:39.626 --> 03:27:41.626
YOGI: She feel it cool in her knee, Shri Mataji. (Laughter)

03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:45.000
SHRI MATAJI: All right, get up now.

03:27:46.667 --> 03:27:47.709
All right now? Better?

03:27:53.959 --> 03:27:55.959
(Another seeker approaches)

03:27:55.959 --> 03:27:56.999
So, how are you?

03:27:57.542 --> 03:28:01.334
SEEKER: All right, but I have always problems with my throat and…

03:28:01.334 --> 03:28:03.709
YOGI: She has problems with her throat [and different parts of it].

03:28:03.709 --> 03:28:06.000
SHRI MATAJI: Huh? She's what?

03:28:06.209 --> 03:28:08.792
YOGI: She has problems with her…

03:28:08.792 --> 03:28:19.751
SEEKER: I have always sore throat and… always…

03:28:21.334 --> 03:28:22.834
YOGI: She [UNCLEAR] in her throat.

03:28:29.459 --> 03:28:30.999
SHRI MATAJI: You've been to some guru or someone?

03:28:31.209 --> 03:28:31.709
SEEKER: Yes.

03:28:31.959 --> 03:28:32.459
SHRI MATAJI: Which one?

03:28:32.834 --> 03:28:34.000
SEEKER: Shri Chinmoy.

03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:34.584
YOGI: Chinmoy.

03:28:40.667 --> 03:28:41.417
SHRI MATAJI: How do I know?

03:28:44.876 --> 03:28:46.125
Useless fellow.

03:28:48.250 --> 03:28:49.250
YOGI: What did they teach you?

03:28:50.375 --> 03:28:52.501
SHRI MATAJI: See, he's the one who has given you this trouble, you know.

03:28:52.626 --> 03:28:55.459
If you want to go, go to him, that is your choice.

03:28:55.459 --> 03:28:59.417
SEEKER: I didn't know that he was giving me that trouble, I… I believed in him.

03:29:10.918 --> 03:29:13.292
But I left him one year ago, so it's…

03:29:13.250 --> 03:29:17.542
SHRI MATAJI: He's still in there. [UNCLEAR], huh? Turn around.

03:29:20.876 --> 03:29:22.584
Now put your hand like this. (Puts the seeker's right hand on the seeker's stomach)

03:29:27.999 --> 03:29:31.626
Now say: "Mother, I am my own master."

03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:42.000
(Shri Mataji works on the seeker's Vishuddhi from behind)

03:30:18.250 --> 03:30:20.501
YOGI: What do you feel? Is the pain there?

03:30:20.751 --> 03:30:22.000
SEEKER: Yes, it's [UNCLEAR].

03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:23.334
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] to left Swadhishthana.

03:30:26.292 --> 03:30:26.876
SHRI MATAJI: All right?

03:30:27.584 --> 03:30:28.125
YOGI: Turn around.

03:30:31.459 --> 03:30:33.918
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR].

03:30:36.042 --> 03:30:36.542
It's done.

03:30:37.542 --> 03:30:42.250
YOGI: Come to the centre [UNCLEAR] and they'll tell you…

03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:54.542
SHRI MATAJI: Now.

03:30:54.542 --> 03:30:56.292
SEEKER: I feel my heartbeat in here (points at her throat).

03:30:56.584 --> 03:30:57.000
SHRI MATAJI: Better now?

03:30:57.000 --> 03:30:58.459
YOGI: She feels pulsating in…

03:30:58.459 --> 03:30:59.417
SHRI MATAJI: Now it's better.

03:30:59.751 --> 03:31:02.918
They will tell you what should — come along, they'll tell you what is to be done, all right?

03:31:03.125 --> 03:31:04.834
And don't go to such a fellow.

03:31:07.667 --> 03:31:09.334
Now, any books and all that, throw it away.

03:31:10.501 --> 03:31:11.959
SEEKER: Thank you [for Your help].

03:31:15.751 --> 03:31:17.751
(Another seeker approaches)

03:31:17.751 --> 03:31:18.334
SHRI MATAJI: How are you?

03:31:29.292 --> 03:31:34.501
YOGI: She can't move her neck, Shri Mataji, when she wakes up in the morning.

03:31:34.501 --> 03:31:35.042
SHRI MATAJI: Really?

03:31:35.834 --> 03:31:36.709
YOGI: Sometimes.

03:31:38.626 --> 03:31:40.167
SHRI MATAJI: Have you any guru?

03:31:44.918 --> 03:31:45.417
Sure.

03:32:02.459 --> 03:32:03.709
Constipated normally?

03:32:05.250 --> 03:32:07.292
Are you constipated [UNCLEAR]?

03:32:13.792 --> 03:32:14.542
Sometimes.

03:32:24.834 --> 03:32:25.918
[UNCLEAR].

03:32:35.375 --> 03:32:36.125
Now forgive.

03:32:37.584 --> 03:32:39.584
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

03:33:16.083 --> 03:33:17.501
YOGI: Take a deep breath and hold it.

03:33:18.417 --> 03:33:19.250
Take a deep breath…

03:33:20.501 --> 03:33:22.542
SHRI MATAJI: Take a deep breath and hold it.

03:33:26.751 --> 03:33:27.334
Now leave it.

03:33:29.999 --> 03:33:30.751
Again hold it.

03:33:35.292 --> 03:33:36.125
Hold it again.

03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:40.751
Leave it now.

03:33:46.083 --> 03:33:46.918
Hold it again.

03:33:51.375 --> 03:33:52.000
Now leave it.

03:33:57.334 --> 03:33:58.292
Why do you feel guilty?

03:34:13.792 --> 03:34:15.751
YOGI: She feels it very strong cool, Shri Mataji.

03:34:17.584 --> 03:34:18.334
SHRI MATAJI: Feeling it now?

03:34:23.375 --> 03:34:24.999
YOGI: She feels the cool breeze, Shri Mataji.

03:34:24.999 --> 03:34:26.167
SHRI MATAJI: [Now you are not guilty].

03:34:29.501 --> 03:34:33.709
Don't feel guilty, that's all. Try.

03:34:33.709 --> 03:34:34.292
SEEKER: Thank you.

03:34:34.542 --> 03:34:35.209
SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you!

03:34:57.209 --> 03:34:59.209
(Another seeker approaches)

03:34:59.209 --> 03:35:01.292
YOGI: He doesn't feel the cool breeze, Shri Mataji.

03:35:02.167 --> 03:35:03.292
SHRI MATAJI: You have been to some guru?

03:35:15.709 --> 03:35:20.542
YOGI: He was communicating with dead people. Spiritistic thing.

03:35:23.125 --> 03:35:25.083
SHRI MATAJI: Very wrong. All right.

03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:26.751
Put the hand there.

03:35:27.626 --> 03:35:29.584
Just say: "I am my own master, Mother."

03:35:32.042 --> 03:35:33.959
Just say: "I am my own master."

03:35:58.042 --> 03:35:58.584
YOGI: It's better?

03:36:05.083 --> 03:36:06.209
He's feeling it, Shri Mataji.

03:36:08.083 --> 03:36:09.083
SHRI MATAJI: You feel the cool breeze?

03:36:12.083 --> 03:36:13.375
YOGI: He feels it, Shri Mataji.

03:36:13.834 --> 03:36:14.876
SHRI MATAJI: All right, done now.

03:36:15.417 --> 03:36:17.375
Now, don't do all that nonsense, all right?

03:36:23.375 --> 03:36:26.167
Come and see them and perfect yourself.

03:36:26.751 --> 03:36:27.417
(To yogi) Just tell that.

03:36:30.125 --> 03:36:31.250
All right? May God bless you!

03:36:32.250 --> 03:36:34.250
(Another seeker approaches)

03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:35.250
So, how are you?

03:36:35.667 --> 03:36:36.250
SEEKER: I'm fine.

03:36:36.542 --> 03:36:37.209
SHRI MATAJI: You felt it?

03:36:38.375 --> 03:36:41.459
None of? None of? All right, put both your hands.

03:36:52.125 --> 03:36:53.000
What work you do?

03:36:58.959 --> 03:37:01.834
YOGI: He's a… independent, Shri Mataji.

03:37:02.250 --> 03:37:05.626
He's a… working something in the financial things.

03:37:07.459 --> 03:37:08.125
SHRI MATAJI: What is it?

03:37:08.125 --> 03:37:09.876
YOGI: Ah, he's working for banks and insurances.

03:37:13.792 --> 03:37:16.709
SHRI MATAJI: All right. What is insurance, huh?

03:37:20.334 --> 03:37:21.125
Put your hand.

03:37:22.876 --> 03:37:25.584
(To yogi) [Tell him to ask the insurance of the insurances].

03:37:26.542 --> 03:37:30.250
YOGI: You just say: "Mother, are You the insurance of all insurances?"

03:37:35.459 --> 03:37:37.417
SHRI MATAJI: (Laughing) [Let him ask it.] All right.

03:37:46.667 --> 03:37:49.751
Such heat! So much heat you have in the body!

03:37:51.292 --> 03:37:53.918
Now just go on asking the question: "Mother, are you…"

03:37:56.918 --> 03:37:58.584
(To yogi) Ask him to ask the question.

03:38:17.501 --> 03:38:18.751
YOGI: He's feeling it, Shri Mataji.

03:38:19.999 --> 03:38:22.918
SHRI MATAJI: All right? That's the answer. Now you say: "You are…"

03:38:34.417 --> 03:38:36.375
See now, listen, mister, come here.

03:38:37.667 --> 03:38:39.626
Have you been in the sun recently?

03:38:40.209 --> 03:38:40.751
SEEKER: Yes, I do.

03:38:41.584 --> 03:38:44.834
SHRI MATAJI: Don't do that, that's not good for you. You are right-sided.

03:38:47.876 --> 03:38:49.250
You'll develop skin trouble.

03:38:55.292 --> 03:38:56.959
All right? Don't do it, don't do it.

03:38:57.792 --> 03:38:59.542
You just come to them and they'll teach you.

03:39:00.709 --> 03:39:02.918
Insurance, they'll teach you the insurance. (Laughter)

03:39:08.834 --> 03:39:10.834
(Another seeker approaches)

03:39:10.834 --> 03:39:12.209
YOGI: He's a Sahaja Yogi, Shri Mataji.

03:39:12.417 --> 03:39:13.250
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR].

03:39:21.751 --> 03:39:22.999
I think [UNCLEAR].

03:39:33.250 --> 03:39:35.250
(Another seeker approaches)

03:39:35.250 --> 03:39:35.999
You didn't feel it?

03:39:41.334 --> 03:39:42.792
YOGI: He felt a little bit, Shri Mataji.

03:39:43.834 --> 03:39:47.125
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR].

03:39:50.667 --> 03:39:53.542
But you must forgive. You must forgive is the point.

03:39:54.501 --> 03:39:55.959
You must forgive everyone.

03:39:57.250 --> 03:39:57.959
Do you want to forgive?

03:40:00.709 --> 03:40:03.417
From your heart you say: "Mother, I forgive everyone."

03:40:08.375 --> 03:40:11.999
Again. Again. Do it again.

03:40:14.709 --> 03:40:15.542
Once more.

03:40:21.083 --> 03:40:21.667
Felt it?

03:40:28.250 --> 03:40:29.250
YOGI: He feels it stronger.

03:40:35.292 --> 03:40:37.584
SHRI MATAJI: If you don't forgive, you'll have all the problems.

03:40:43.834 --> 03:40:46.709
And for nothing, it's a myth. All right?

03:40:50.083 --> 03:40:51.999
Come and learn from them everything.

03:40:54.209 --> 03:40:58.292
You should [face] it, otherwise next year you'll come out with another problem.

03:40:58.417 --> 03:41:00.417
(Another seeker approaches)

03:41:00.417 --> 03:41:01.042
So.

03:41:14.709 --> 03:41:15.292
SEEKER: Not so easy.

03:41:15.751 --> 03:41:17.125
YOGI: He didn't feel it, Shri Mataji.

03:41:23.250 --> 03:41:25.125
SHRI MATAJI: Forgive [UNCLEAR] from your heart.

03:41:30.501 --> 03:41:31.834
Forgive everyone.

03:41:36.042 --> 03:41:36.584
Now?

03:41:40.250 --> 03:41:42.584
Better? Forgive.

03:41:42.584 --> 03:41:44.584
(Shri Mataji puts Her fourth finger on the seeker's forehead and keeps turning it clockwise)

03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:54.876
Now. Better now?

03:41:58.042 --> 03:41:58.876
There's no thought.

03:41:59.334 --> 03:42:00.626
YOGI: Coming warm, Shri Mataji.

03:42:09.834 --> 03:42:10.459
SHRI MATAJI: Now cooler.

03:42:17.417 --> 03:42:17.876
Better?

03:42:18.292 --> 03:42:19.000
SEEKER: Yes, Mother.

03:42:19.125 --> 03:42:19.751
SHRI MATAJI: Cooler now?

03:42:21.709 --> 03:42:22.584
Cool or hot?

03:42:23.709 --> 03:42:24.459
SEEKER: It's still heat.

03:42:24.667 --> 03:42:25.584
SHRI MATAJI: Still hot.

03:42:26.209 --> 03:42:27.375
YOGI: Coming hot, Shri Mataji.

03:42:27.792 --> 03:42:30.209
SHRI MATAJI: Hot. Might be out of liver.

03:42:31.042 --> 03:42:32.626
YOGI: Now it's coming cool. Now it's cool.

03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:36.042
SHRI MATAJI: All right? Better? Cooler now?

03:42:37.918 --> 03:42:39.709
YOGI: Now it's there. Very strong there.

03:42:44.999 --> 03:42:45.584
SHRI MATAJI: Better now?

03:42:49.709 --> 03:42:56.250
Come and meet them, and they'll tell you — little problem of the liver also — they'll tell you what is to be done. All right?

03:42:58.459 --> 03:43:00.876
Very cool, and [UNCLEAR] on the head are very cool.

03:43:06.918 --> 03:43:08.918
(Another seeker approaches)

03:43:08.918 --> 03:43:10.751
Now, did you feel it?

03:43:10.959 --> 03:43:11.459
SEEKER: Yes.

03:43:12.042 --> 03:43:12.501
SHRI MATAJI: Good.

03:43:33.834 --> 03:43:34.292
Better?

03:43:45.501 --> 03:43:46.667
YOGI: She feels it, Shri Mataji.

03:43:47.125 --> 03:43:48.209
SHRI MATAJI: Very good.

03:43:57.876 --> 03:43:59.459
YOGI: She feels very strong right heart.

03:44:03.375 --> 03:44:05.584
SHRI MATAJI: You have to feel it all fingers, all right?

03:44:07.250 --> 03:44:10.000
All right, go and see them. May God bless you!

03:44:14.250 --> 03:44:14.792
All right?

03:44:30.584 --> 03:44:32.584
(Another seeker approaches)

03:44:32.584 --> 03:44:35.834
YOGI: She was here yesterday and today. Yesterday she felt, but today not.

03:44:41.792 --> 03:44:46.667
She was already sitting in front of the picture feeling the cool breeze whole day through, Shri Mataji.

03:44:47.292 --> 03:44:48.751
SHRI MATAJI: Now did you feel it now?

03:44:51.125 --> 03:44:51.999
Now it's all right.

03:44:59.584 --> 03:45:02.542
Now, you've been thinking too much, you've been thinking too much.

03:45:02.501 --> 03:45:03.542
YOGI: Now it's getting cooler.

03:45:20.250 --> 03:45:23.167
SHRI MATAJI: She has to say that "I am a part and parcel of the whole."

03:45:49.250 --> 03:45:50.083
All right now?

03:45:50.083 --> 03:45:51.542
YOGI: Now she's feeling it, Shri Mataji.

03:45:51.501 --> 03:45:54.999
SHRI MATAJI: See now? Like this, you must come and see them and be in collective.

03:45:56.042 --> 03:45:57.792
No use doing at home alone.

03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:02.459
All right?

03:46:04.918 --> 03:46:06.125
(To yogi) See how [UNCLEAR].

03:46:08.667 --> 03:46:10.667
(Another seeker approaches)

03:46:10.667 --> 03:46:11.626
Now, how is it?

03:46:23.501 --> 03:46:27.042
YOGI: She felt it more than last time, [in October] she was also there.

03:46:27.250 --> 03:46:29.792
She came here to [UNCLEAR], Shri Mataji.

03:46:31.584 --> 03:46:35.834
SHRI MATAJI: But now you have to come and join them so that you become perfect, all right?

03:46:41.042 --> 03:46:43.042
(Another seeker approaches)

03:46:43.042 --> 03:46:44.042
So, how are you?

03:46:45.459 --> 03:46:46.334
Felt fine?

03:46:46.501 --> 03:46:47.417
SEEKER: I don't know, actually…

03:46:55.125 --> 03:46:56.167
YOGI: She's feeling really better.

03:46:56.375 --> 03:46:58.417
SEEKER: No, to save [the seeing].

03:46:58.417 --> 03:46:59.459
SHRI MATAJI: Your eyes [UNCLEAR]?

03:46:59.834 --> 03:47:04.751
SEEKER: Um, yes. [UNCLEAR] not much, never. And…

03:47:05.417 --> 03:47:06.375
SHRI MATAJI: It's not sighting.

04:10:56.501 --> 04:10:57.459
SHRI MATAJI: So, how are you?

04:11:04.334 --> 04:11:05.709
Join these people, all right?

04:11:09.000 --> 04:11:13.834
All right? You master it now, you have to become a master. Next time I come I should see you are the master.

04:11:25.667 --> 04:11:27.667
(Another seeker approaches)

04:11:27.667 --> 04:11:28.417
SHRI MATAJI: So, how are you?

04:11:54.167 --> 04:11:57.250
YOGI: Some people say, "You might have cancer because you smoke so much."

04:11:57.542 --> 04:11:58.918
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR]?

04:12:01.125 --> 04:12:01.999
What are you doing?

04:12:21.792 --> 04:12:24.999
YOGI: Somebody was working with the candle and told [UNCLEAR].

04:12:29.501 --> 04:12:30.999
SHRI MATAJI: That you [UNCLEAR] [cancer].

04:12:43.459 --> 04:12:47.083
Never do that [UNCLEAR], horrible!

04:12:48.834 --> 04:12:50.042
Ah, that's the reason.

04:12:51.626 --> 04:12:54.999
Now, you're smoking a lot? Stop it.

04:13:00.417 --> 04:13:02.250
[UNCLEAR] smoking people.

04:13:05.250 --> 04:13:05.667
All right?

04:13:07.792 --> 04:13:12.042
[You can stop it]. You won't enjoy. And you won't even like the smoke.

04:13:13.834 --> 04:13:14.292
All right?

04:13:20.250 --> 04:13:22.250
(Another seeker approaches)

04:13:22.250 --> 04:13:24.709
SHRI MATAJI: So, how are you? Feeling joy, huh?

04:13:27.083 --> 04:13:28.792
[UNCLEAR], huh?

04:13:29.042 --> 04:13:31.334
YOGI: He has problems to feel vibrations, Shri Mataji.

04:13:31.542 --> 04:13:32.918
SEEKER: Sometimes, not [yet].

04:13:34.417 --> 04:13:34.959
SHRI MATAJI: Feels where?

04:13:37.334 --> 04:13:42.375
SEEKER: On the hands and here (shows above his head), I could feel the breeze here… (points at his back)

04:13:43.542 --> 04:13:45.709
SHRI MATAJI: (Pointing at the seeker's left hand) But you feel on this one more, hmm?

04:13:49.167 --> 04:13:54.334
SEEKER: And since [UNCLEAR] I have problems with my… (points at his left thumb)

04:13:54.999 --> 04:13:55.542
SHRI MATAJI: Put your hand.

04:13:56.626 --> 04:14:00.626
And say: "Mother, You are the pure knowledge."

04:14:17.292 --> 04:14:18.751
Have you been to some guru or someone?

04:14:19.792 --> 04:14:23.167
SEEKER: I was sympathy to that one, to Rajneesh.

04:14:23.167 --> 04:14:26.167
SHRI MATAJI: Horrible fellow.
YOGI: He was just sympathizing, Shri Mataji.

04:14:27.125 --> 04:14:28.584
SHRI MATAJI: What is there to sympathize?

04:14:33.209 --> 04:14:38.209
Om sakshat Ravana mardini, Om sakshat Ravana mardini … (continues repeating the mantra)

04:14:44.042 --> 04:14:46.209
Ha! All right?

04:14:48.999 --> 04:14:50.125
[Killing Ravana now].

04:14:50.125 --> 04:14:51.000
SEEKER: It's, it's hot.

04:14:52.876 --> 04:14:56.709
SHRI MATAJI: Now you just say: "Mother… Mother, did You kill Ravana?"

04:14:57.667 --> 04:14:59.584
SEEKER: Mother, did You kill …
SHRI MATAJI: Ravana.

04:14:59.834 --> 04:15:02.209
SEEKER: … Ravana? Mother, did You kill Ravana?

04:15:02.209 --> 04:15:07.167
(Continues repeating the question)

04:15:12.042 --> 04:15:12.501
SHRI MATAJI: All right?

04:15:13.042 --> 04:15:14.834
All right, Ravana has been killed. (Laughter)

04:15:20.292 --> 04:15:21.167
That's Rajneesh.

04:15:24.000 --> 04:15:26.000
(Another seeker approaches)

04:15:26.000 --> 04:15:27.417
So, now, how are you?

04:15:42.959 --> 04:15:45.751
Good, he is all right. He is all right.

04:15:54.751 --> 04:15:55.999
YOGI: He's doing Hatha Yoga.

04:15:56.584 --> 04:15:57.250
SHRI MATAJI: It's all right.

04:15:59.584 --> 04:16:00.000
SEEKER: Japa (chanting of mantra).

04:16:00.959 --> 04:16:02.417
YOGI: Japa? What is japa?

04:16:03.584 --> 04:16:05.459
SHRI MATAJI: Japa? What japa?

04:16:06.375 --> 04:16:09.250
YOGI: Mantra, Shri Mataji. Saying mantra, Shri Mataji.

04:16:11.167 --> 04:16:15.834
SHRI MATAJI: Now you ask Me a question like this: "Mother, are You the source of all the mantras?"

04:16:15.834 --> 04:16:17.834
(Seeker repeats the question)

04:16:36.999 --> 04:16:38.125
Who has given you the mantra?

04:16:42.542 --> 04:16:43.250
SEEKER: Hare Krishna.

04:16:43.834 --> 04:16:44.959
YOGI: Hare Krishna, Shri Mataji.

04:16:47.083 --> 04:16:49.167
SHRI MATAJI: Ask Me a question: "Mother, are You Shri Krishna?"

04:16:55.167 --> 04:16:56.042
Keep your eyes open.

04:16:56.042 --> 04:16:58.042
(Seeker repeats the question)

04:17:13.042 --> 04:17:13.584
All right?

04:17:15.375 --> 04:17:17.334
YOGI: [Czechoslovakia].
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?
YOGI: [Czechoslovakia].

04:17:17.999 --> 04:17:20.167
SHRI MATAJI: Let's see. [Czechoslovakia].

04:17:47.042 --> 04:17:50.292
(To yogi) [UNCLEAR]. Use the light on him.

04:17:52.000 --> 04:17:55.792
(To somebody) Are you all right now? Are you all right? You are all right?

04:17:55.792 --> 04:17:57.667
(To the seeker) All right. Please sit down there.

04:19:00.876 --> 04:19:02.876
(Seeker continues repeating the question)

04:19:02.876 --> 04:19:05.250
Now. All right?

04:19:05.959 --> 04:19:06.709
Feel the cool breeze?

04:19:08.334 --> 04:19:10.417
I had to go back six thousand years back.

04:19:16.417 --> 04:19:21.834
Now, you just try to practice Sahaja Yoga, establish yourself, all right?

04:19:22.083 --> 04:19:24.250
(To yogi) [Deep] here the problem here in the Hamsa, all right?

04:19:28.167 --> 04:19:29.501
(To seeker) They'll tell you what is to be done.

04:19:39.042 --> 04:19:44.209
You must understand what centre… because you have these centres there. This is the centre of Shri Krishna.

04:19:44.792 --> 04:19:48.626
That's the one we deal with. Can you imagine how much [UNCLEAR]!

04:20:21.417 --> 04:20:24.542
All right? Do you follow My point now? Join them.

04:20:26.209 --> 04:20:30.834
It's good now. Otherwise you would get cancer in here (points at Vishuddhi). It's very hot here.

04:20:32.792 --> 04:20:34.334
Aah, [this is].

04:20:35.751 --> 04:20:38.584
So many of these Hare Ramas [UNCLEAR].

04:21:08.250 --> 04:21:12.250
(Yogi tries to help another yogi to put on Shri Mataji's socks, Shri Mataji laughs)

04:21:12.250 --> 04:21:13.709
YOGI: I'm not very experienced.

04:21:15.083 --> 04:21:17.250
SHRI MATAJI: Now you are going to have a baby in the family. (Laughter)

04:21:18.834 --> 04:21:20.584
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] express it from [UNCLEAR].

04:21:21.667 --> 04:21:22.999
SHRI MATAJI: That's why [UNCLEAR]. (Laughs)

04:21:33.626 --> 04:21:37.167
(To a seeker) Join them, all right? Get all right, [here is] the problem. Come to them.

04:21:38.083 --> 04:21:38.999
Did you follow?

04:21:40.083 --> 04:21:41.167
(To yogi) Did you say to him?

04:21:44.250 --> 04:21:45.459
(To another seeker) You're better now, you see?

04:21:46.584 --> 04:21:50.959
Now, don't do any water treatment, just do this. No water treatment.

04:21:51.334 --> 04:21:53.918
(To another seeker) You, too. Keep you all right, huh?

04:22:00.000 --> 04:22:01.667
So tomorrow we'll go to Frankfurt.

04:22:06.751 --> 04:22:08.125
It's already tomorrow, I think. (Laughter)
