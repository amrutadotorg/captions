1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,040
Before we start celebrating the birth of Christ,

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,360
we have to little bit review what we have done after His Birth,

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,040
so that we understand where we stand in relation to Him.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,440
For He was the Son of a Virgin

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,720
so that even the slightest blot on His name

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,320
should not be created.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:57,000
Because He was to do the greatest job,

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,200
of creating for us Agnya awareness,

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,440
which would help us to suck in all our sins,

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,680
all our conditionings, and all our egos.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,480
And the great personality

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,680
was created for such a great work within ourselves.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
For us divine laws are binding because we know

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,640
that is the only way one can rise.

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,760
It is not compulsion,

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,160
but voluntary acceptance that we have to rise,

17
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,080
that we have to be alright,

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,920
there are no conditionings in Sahaja Yoga

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,320
but this is how we improve,

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,640
this is how we go further,

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,600
so we accept the situation, and we move forward with it.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,280
That is why realization should give you that strength to fight

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,920
anti-Christ activity within your mind.

24
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,240
You have to face yourself, is the point I am saying.

25
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,880
Not only that you have to face yourself,

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,320
but you have to face the so-called society that is around you,

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,720
and see for yourself that these conditionings

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,960
and these anti-Christ activities into which you have indulged

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,160
are completely detrimental to your growth, and to your ascent.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,480
And as you are special people who have got realization,

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,120
you have to argue it out with yourself and reach proper conclusions.

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,320
No use arguing out with others.

33
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,560
As you know with the conditioning,

34
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,440
people get quiet, they do not talk,

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,480
but the conditioning is growing inside.

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,680
With the ego people talk too much

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,720
and they aggress others with their talking

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,000
and the ego is growing too much.

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,960
So one has to be in the witness state,

40
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,560
that means wherever you have to talk, you have to talk

41
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
and wherever you have to keep quiet, you have to keep quiet.

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,360
This is at the Vishuddhi level.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,960
At the Agnya level, you have to detest

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:53,440
all that is ugly, all that is unholy, all that is filth.

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,160
Because now a new sensitivity has developed within you.

46
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,560
And a new sensitivity to Holiness, to auspiciousness.

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,360
Try to improve this auspiciousness within you.

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:18,280
I find people get very easily attached to negative people.

49
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,040
They get identified with negative people, very common.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,520
And they think that they are being sympathetic.

51
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,360
It is the sympathy they are working.

52
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,200
So I have to tell you one thing that

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,560
to have your ego problems settled,

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,600
first of all see, that you are not playing to your ego.

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,800
And also, see your conditioning which are now bhoots,

56
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,320
all these conditionings have become bhoots in you.

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,520
All the Church bhoots have got into your heads.

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,760
They are all there. So you must see that these bhoots are not there,

59
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,400
because we have to be holy. We have to be clean.

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,520
We have to be resurrected.

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,080
We are resurrected people.

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,000
Christ has resurrected us.

63
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,520
But you have to think how much he has to work for us.

64
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,920
The more you try to be in unison with negativity,

65
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,000
we harm him more, we torture him more, we trouble him more.

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,720
The one who was born in the manger

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,640
in the most difficult circumstances,

68
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,520
where everybody requires comfort,

69
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,440
who from the very beginning

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,360
went through hazardous life till His death.

71
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,760
His birth itself, you can see, was in a cow-shed.

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,320
None of you are born in a cow-shed.

73
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,800
And while the Christians are so particular about comforts,

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,560
most surprising is, why Christ was born in a cow-shed?

75
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,600
In a very very cold night Christ was born.

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,520
Nothing much to cover; sparkling beauty it was.

77
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:37,480
Now we have to keep him within ourselves comfortably.

78
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:46,280
We are not going to give Him that manger in our Agnya Chakra.

79
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:53,920
Manger of thoughts and a crown of thoughts.

80
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,400
That we are not going to give Him.

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
We are going to make Him comfortable

82
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,760
by not accepting negativity as a sympathy.

83
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:13,280
You have to be kind towards your auspiciousness and holiness

84
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:22,680
so that Christ enjoys His stay there in your Agnya.

85
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:34,160
That we do not torture Him by our useless ideas,

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,800
uncomfortable behaviors,

87
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,480
inauspicious appearances

88
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,160
and unholy acceptance of wrong ideas.

89
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,720
Try to respect Him. There He stands.

90
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,920
Try to make Him very comfortable.

91
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,720
I wish I could do that, but He resides in everybody’s Agnya Chakra.

92
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,200
If He was only in my Agnya,

93
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,720
I would have given Him the greatest comforts,

94
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,880
but he wants to be manifested in everybody’s Agnya.

95
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,280
So I have to request you as a Mother to look after Him,

96
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,040
give Him a nice cradle,

97
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,440
give Him a comfortable time,

98
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600
because He is born to give you your resurrection.

99
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,520
He has taken up such a great responsibility

100
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,920
to suck all your conditioning and to suck all your ego,

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,520
but that does not mean that you put stones on top of it.

102
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,240
Today is the great day of holiness.

103
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,120
Let us celebrate the birth of Christ in our Agnya Chakra

104
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,680
and let us sing praise of it so that He in His pure essence,

105
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,880
in his holy body, He should be there,

106
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,240
And in purity you respect him.

107
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,720
Absolutely purity because He is purity.

108
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
Now you may say that Mother if He is pure purity

109
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,600
– there are some stupid people who ask me –

110
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,240
“if He is purity, then how can we make him impure?”

111
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,320
What I mean, if you do not respect Him,

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,600
why will He be there? He will disappear.

113
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,000
He likes purity. He will disappear from there.

114
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,200
He is not good for you.

115
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,360
So better create a cradle,

116
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,960
a beautiful cradle, of love, of honesty,

117
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,800
as His Mother prepared for Him.

118
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,720
With all sweetness and kindness and assurance

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,800
that you will nurture the beauty and the auspiciousness of Christ.

120
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,080
May God bless you all.
