00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.680
My job is to encourage you to tell you

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.120
about your inner subtleties, your beauty.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.360
Now do you know what beautiful thing you are?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.640
Let us talk about our inner beauty.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.040
What are we?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040
Are we all these mad people?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.600
Are we all these people who are all the time are miserable?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.040
Or are we all these people who are always fighting,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.240
those who are hankering after things,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.080
whom this matter dominates?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
No, we are the Spirit.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.600
We are the Spirit. We are the reflection of God Almighty,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.080
which is Purity,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.600
which is Truth, which is Knowledge.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.640
We are that.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.320
We are not like ordinary people.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.520
How can we live on that level?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.680
Only if you are possessed, if you had a bad guru

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.720
or something like that, maybe you are going like a yo-yo,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.800
going up and down, up and down, up and down,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.560
but those who have crossed all those limits

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.600
have reached that state, should value that they are the Spirit

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.280
so many Spirits sitting here, sitting, reflecting God Almighty.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.560
I am such a proud mother

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.200
and all of you are capable of enlightening

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.000
so many people in this world.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.320
But the beauty within you is that you are

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.760
absolutely independent of anybody else.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.840
You depend only upon yourself,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.200
upon the source of your Spirit,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.480
the joy of your Spirit.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.080
You don't expect others to give you joy.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.760
Supposing somebody tomorrow comes and abuses Me.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.520
I'll say, "All right. It doesn't matter."

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.400
It never touches Me

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.840
because I am with Myself.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.440
He is saying these things.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.880
He will suffer or not suffer. That's not My department.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.880
When you start depending only upon yourself,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.760
just imagine a house

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.920
which is standing on rocks.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.600
Like that, you are.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.880
Try to feel it. Feel the rock within you.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.560
Try to understand.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.400
You are not going to behave like other people.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600
It's all right, people who have built their houses on sands

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.480
have to worry, not we. We have built on rocks.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.280
So we have to be very courageous.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.520
You have to be very bold.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.200
At the same time, extremely humble.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.000
When the tree is laden with fruits it bends down.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.120
So we worship the Mother Earth.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.640
We worship the sun. We worship the moon.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.880
We  worship everything around us which has helped us.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.200
We worship our parents, everyone.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.040
But above all we worship ourselves.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.520
Because we are worshipable.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.920
Now all of you have become saints.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.240
That doesn't mean that you develop beards and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.520
have all funny dresses and all that. Nothing of the kind.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.280
You are saints because inside you

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.520
there is the fragrance of beautiful fragrance

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.400
of your lotus.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.360
That's the Spirit.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.040
This is a lotus you have made for Me here.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.040
Such a beautiful lotus, I am sitting in a beautiful lotus.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.360
In the same way is reflected in your heart as a beautiful lotus.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.560
Feel that lotus,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.040
how beautiful, how delicate it is.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.960
It's pink because pink is the lotus which

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.440
invites everyone,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.360
sign of generosity, of invitation.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.360
Pink colour attracts all kinds of insects, everybody.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.360
So lotus is pink

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.120
and it invites everything,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.280
open to everything, not frightened of anything.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.280
But it comes out of the mire,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.840
comes out of absolutely horrible ponds.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.760
There are lots of worms going round it, all right,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.520
but it emits the fragrance

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.400
and makes the whole pond so beautiful.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.920
That's what you are.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.040
Wherever you'll be, you can create that beauty.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.760
You can flow that beauty.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.480
You can make people see

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.880
what a Spiritual person is.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.720
You are the reflector of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.080
You have to reflect Sahaj Yoga.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.800
For such people are always in joy

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.040
and wisdom.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.480
Shri Ganesha is the giver of wisdom

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.080
wisdom, how to behave at what time,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.800
how to say at what time,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.680
how far to go with everything.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.560
It just should become innate,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.320
Sahaj. You don't have to work it out, but should know.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.240
"Now I am a Sahaja Yogini."

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.160
Every morning you should tell yourself, "I am a Sahaja Yogini.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.880
So how far I should go?

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.800
How should I behave?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.520
What should be my attitude?"

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.640
All this can be very easily understood if

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.120
you develop this lotus of wisdom.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.240
How does a lotus come out? There is a seed which sprouts.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.120
That's how the wisdom - there is already the seed within you.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.400
All of you have got and now it has started opening

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.320
because you are realised souls.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.920
Allow your wisdom to take over.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.960
So how do you do it?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.960
There's one way, I would say.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.440
"Supposing Mother had this problem, what She would have done?"

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.840
Very good idea.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.400
"How She would have dealt with it?"

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.800
You may again say that we don't understand Mother's style.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.360
She's full of tricks. Correct. I am.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.080
But there's a very simple way of doing it.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.760
You can surrender it to My wisdom

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.160
and the wisdom itself that is in you is active.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.760
It will work.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.040
This point also you should understand.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.880
Wisdom within you is active.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.600
There was one gentleman working at the airport in London.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.080
He's a Sahaja Yogi,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.720
but he doesn't come to the collective. He has no time.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.920
So somebody said something harsh to him.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.040
He went home and he said that

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.080
"It's not good he said to me. After all, I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.760
And next day he heard

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.560
the fellow has fallen from his bike.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.400
The gentleman might not have understood that because

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.040
he said all these things, "That's why this has happened to me."

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.840
But he knew because Deities are with you.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:22.480
So in wisdom you understand that all the Deities are just with you

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.600
and whatever happens to you, they're before you.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.760
Nobody can harm you. Nobody can touch you.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.960
You are so protected. Lotuses are not protected.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.200
You are so protected that anybody tries to harm you,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.160
immediately there's protection.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.920
Also your own protection is there, as I said,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.960
that you jump into thoughtless awareness.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.160
We harm ourselves more than anybody else can sometimes.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.160
One friend of mine I knew,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.400
she was from very childhood she was like that,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.360
always crying for everything.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.160
Always she used to cry

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.480
for nothing at all because she was such a spoiled child

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.400
that she used to always cry.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.080
Now, was surprised to see at a very young age she became blind.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.640
I said, "How did you become so blind?"

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.440
She had to use a very thick glass and all that.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.800
She said, "I used to cry so much, you remember."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.840
I said, "That I remember,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.280
but did you cry even after school?"

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.480
"Yes, I was always crying like this."

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.680
So it's a kind of a personality you develop

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.320
that "I'm like that, I just cry."

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.840
But why not develop a personality that, "I am always in joy?"

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.440
Anything I see, I feel joyous.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.360
Anything I hear, I feel joy.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.800
Then this lotus of your fragrance will improve

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:20.840
and then activity of your wisdom will be

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.440
that you will take all that is very beautiful

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.840
easily.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.920
You'll get all that is very satisfying, very joyous.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.800
It's kind of an activity of this wisdom within you

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.400
which just leads you to people who are extremely nice,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.960
to situations which are very beautiful

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.280
where you discover nice things

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:10.840
or to such beautiful creations

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.640
that you would never expect to see.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:23.120
It's very, very important to understand that you tell Me,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.800
"Mother, that this miracle happened, that miracle happened."

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.440
Is nothing, is your own wisdom,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.560
your own Spirit is working it out.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.680
You don't have to do anything.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.920
Only thing you have to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogini

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.360
and your character should be that of a Sahaja Yogini,

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.440
that your ideas should be that of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.000
Same with Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.240
Sahaja Yogis, being men, they don't show much,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.840
but there are certain other ways of showing his temper.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.600
They get into tempers and sometimes the tempers are so much that

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.240
you just start looking, "What's the matter with the person?"

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.360
One side the tempers, another side the crying.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.480
I mean, in between, what remains? I don't know.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.680
Both things are absolutely not needed.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.120
You have to correct people, to say things.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.000
Just now I had to say something. I've said it, finished.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:39.760
But it's not anger. It just - I have to act.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.520
The difference is like this - I'm not involved with it.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.040
Even if I cry, I'm not involved. I'm just crying.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.600
Even if I am angry, I am not really angry.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.680
I am just trying to be angry in an acting.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.640
That's what happens.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.600
You do not get involved into it.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.240
But if you get involved into your anger,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.800
then the joy is finished, completely finished.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.520
Some people think also that

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.560
if you are joyous you have to be very serious.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.200
Not at all.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.080
What is there to be serious? What is to be serious in this world?

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.680
Everything is stupidity.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.800
I don't find anything serious in this world.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.880
And I can't keep serious for more than three minutes.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.800
Sometimes people take advantage of that, but what can I do?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
That's My nature.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.920
What's so serious? You don't have to create sun.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.240
You don't have to create moon. You don't have to create Mother Earth.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.600
What's so serious? What great jobs have you to do?

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:57.280
Everything is there for you. Just enjoy.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.000
What is there to be so serious?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.160
Some people, you know, try to impress also by their seriousness.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.800
Once I saw a lady standing, very seriously thinking.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.120
I said, "What is the problem?"

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.720
"I don't know how to broom this thing, I don't have a broom."

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.560
I said, "Such a big problem is there as if the heavens are falling.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.080
Doesn't matter today you don't do it.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.720
You can do it tomorrow. What is so important?"

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.680
I mean if you don't have something, it's all right.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.880
"No, no, no, I must do it. You see, I'm very house-proud."

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.280
I said, "That's the main problem which is serious."

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.840
So because you suffer from some serious, stupid problems,

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.880
that's why you become serious.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.800
And, by becoming serious, if you think

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.560
your problems will be solved, they will not.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.720
At the same time, I must tell you we should not be frivolous.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.480
We should not be vulgar and not frivolous.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.280
That's not - see these flowers.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.400
Look at them. They are shaking with My vibrations.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.360
But look at them, in their own dignity.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.960
They're going to die tomorrow. They are not bothered

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.280
as long as they are all right there in their own place,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.720
giving you pleasure and happiness, finished.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.280
What is the use of a light?

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.400
Let us see, as a light, as we are. To give the light.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.960
So, we are here to give joy, happiness to everyone,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.080
to make everyone happy.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.120
There are so many ways of making others happy.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.360
And for that, we have to learn also.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.240
So many things we have to learn, how to make others happy.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.640
And then when you make them happy,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.080
then you feel that joy within yourself.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.600
"Oh, they're so happy." See their happiness,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.000
then only this lotus opens out much more.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.920
Like a ripple moves and moves

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:14.280
to the end of the shores

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.400
and then from the shore it returns back.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.120
In the same way, when your joy reaches the joy of others,

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:31.400
then the ripples that come up make a beautiful pattern of your life.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.520
Just think of such situations

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.800
where you did something good to others,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.840
being very nice to others

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.240
and then you found the joy in that person

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.680
and how that joy came back to you.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.720
Think of that pattern that you felt so subtlety in your life,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.040
how it is built in.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.600
Whenever you think of that time or that moment

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:03.360
or that area, whole picture comes to you

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.520
and you think, "What a time!"

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.240
But that time is eternally within you,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.080
all the time and that's why is Diwali so important.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.400
You are all, as I said, you are My light.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.040
And the light is there which is an eternal light.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.280
These lights will be finished.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.360
We'll have to light them every year. Not you people.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.680
You have eternal light and this light is going to spread Joy.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.040
What's the problem of this world?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.760
The whole problem, you take it.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.360
There's no joy.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.000
Simple as that, there's no joy.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.880
If they had joy

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.240
they would not have done all these nonsensical things.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.040
There's no Joy. When you have joy, you don't want to fight,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.040
you don't want to do anything that is harmful.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.560
You don't want to say anything harsh to anyone,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.760
not only that but you do not want to have

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.440
something that will spoil this Mother Earth

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.680
or which will bring ecological problem.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.600
No, you just don't want it,

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.440
don't want to do anything because it harms others.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.480
People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.600
You just feel that "Why should I do such a thing

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.120
which is not so congenial to others?"

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.280
I mean, it's not joy-giving.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.840
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.920
and if you are not joy-giving

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.040
that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.440
and that's why we have to come up now.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.640
We have to become Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.480
That is joy-giving society.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.400
We can change our name, if you like.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:11.120
If Sahaja Yoga is not good - Joy Giving Association.

00:20:21.337 --> 00:20:26.657
So this Love, which is joy, actually I think,

00:20:26.857 --> 00:20:32.537
when this love melts and flows like a river

00:20:34.017 --> 00:20:36.857
and gives nourishment

00:20:37.057 --> 00:20:46.177
to all the surrounding trees on the shores,

00:20:48.057 --> 00:20:50.297
that is the time,

00:20:50.497 --> 00:20:58.617
is the completion of the individuality or a personality

00:20:58.817 --> 00:21:05.017
of that love and that's the time, it feels fulfilled.

00:21:05.217 --> 00:21:10.737
It's not just that you have a light in the corner,

00:21:11.297 --> 00:21:13.857
but it has to flow.

00:21:14.057 --> 00:21:16.297
It has to move.

00:21:16.497 --> 00:21:19.097
It has to nourish.

00:21:19.657 --> 00:21:25.097
Love is not something dead, like a stone.

00:21:27.017 --> 00:21:32.297
When it melts, it encompasses everything

00:21:32.497 --> 00:21:36.137
and everything becomes very beautiful with that.

00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:40.537
So you have to first understand that

00:21:40.737 --> 00:21:43.697
life is for giving joy to others

00:21:43.897 --> 00:21:49.057
because you are now saints and your light has to give Joy.

00:21:49.257 --> 00:21:52.297
Little bit you have to bear.

00:21:52.497 --> 00:21:54.337
You have powers to bear.

00:21:54.537 --> 00:21:58.057
You have all the powers and so I wish you

00:21:58.257 --> 00:22:04.297
good luck for the next year and great prosperity.

00:22:04.537 --> 00:22:06.417
May God bless you.
