00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Public Program

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.420
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:48.870
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
Truth is what it is.

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:51.500
You cannot change it.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.660
You cannot describe it.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.210
You have to experience it.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:05:00.790
And you cannot pay for it.

01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:08.690
You can only discover it through the last
breath of your evolutionary process which

01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:15.850
is a living process into a new awareness,
into a new dimension.

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:22.010
Now whatever I am telling you, please don’t
accept blindfold.

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:27.230
We have had enough problems with the blind
faith.

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:39.430
If you do experience, if you do get the results
of whatever I am saying, you have to accept

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:47.860
is as honest people, because it is for your
good, for the good of the family, for the

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:53.020
good of your country, for the good of the
whole world.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.020
We talk of peace.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:59.600
Now where does this war come in?

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:06.630
From where the ideas of fighting and quarrelling
come in?

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.610
It comes from your mind.

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.520
Now look at this mind.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.270
What it is.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.360
I say it is a myth.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:22.470
Mind is a myth created by the reaction of
your ego and your conditioning.

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:30.390
It’s like the fog or you can say like the
bubbles on the shore of the ocean, which are

01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:35.360
brought forth by your thoughts and your reactions.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.940
But you can’t stop it.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:54.350
When this mind is created, it again substantiates
and support your ego and your conditioning.

01:06:54.350 --> 01:07:05.120
It’s like this as create a computer and
then the computer itself starts controlling

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120
us.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.030
In the same way, this mind starts creating
us.

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:14.860
Or we can say we create the watch and then
this watch starts controlling us.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:25.860
Now all these thoughts are born through this
mind of ours which is nothing but the garbage

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:30.790
we have gathered around by reacting to things.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:41.750
When we see very grotesque type of creation
of things and films, handsome also, very so

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:49.790
called art, we are surprised from what brain
it comes.

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:58.360
There must be some rotten brains that are
bringing it, but brain is reality, not the

01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360
mind.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.020
They come out of the mind.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:10.110
So one has to understand that to get peace
we have to go beyond this mind.

01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:16.020
This mind if the one which reacts and creates
problems for us.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:19.560
Makes us believe into things and, we are conditioned.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.690
We are not free.

01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:29.190
Free people to understand what is reality.

01:08:29.190 --> 01:08:34.190
Reality is beyond the mind.

01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:39.420
Now how to cross the limit of mind.

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:45.260
Like once a doctor in Switzerland said, mother,
you do what you like you can cut my throat,

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.850
but stop these thoughts they’re bombarding
me.

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:53.280
You cannot stop.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:59.230
Because a thought rises and falls off, another
thought rises and falls off.

01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:05.160
These thoughts come to us from the past or
the future.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.440
You’re not in the present.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.250
You cannot be in the present.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:18.760
But when this power that is described to you
already known as the kundalini, rises, then

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.040
she takes your attention beyond the thought.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.360
Beyond the mind.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:33.930
And that is the place where resides the present
reality.

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:41.910
Now this special thing as called as kundalini
is not to be discarded because it is coming

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:42.920
from India.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.540
It has been described in every Scripture.

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:52.000
Even in the Bible it is described that I will
appear before you as tongues of flames.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.180
These are the tongues of flames you see along
the path of the kundalini.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:07.500
Also Mohammad sahib has said very clearly
in his Koran, that if you want to know God,

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.470
you must known yourself.

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:13.100
Christ has said ‘Know Thyself’.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.840
All of them have said the same thing.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:23.570
If you see the Zen system, or Lao Tse or Confucius,
anyone of them.

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:31.620
They all said that unless and until you know
yourself, you are not there, you have no identity.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:42.410
But knowing yourself is very important, because
you are the treasure of knowledge, you are

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:45.310
the wisdom and divine discretion.

01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:48.160
It’s all within you.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.430
Which you should know without any effort.

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:54.430
Effortless.

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:55.430
Sahaj.

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:59.480
‘Sah’ means with, ‘ja’ means born.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:07.650
Born with you is the right to get your self-realisation.

01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:16.380
It’s your birth right to have it and in
these modern times it has been made very very

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.350
easy somehow to get this realization.

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:31.980
In our country also, all the saints have described
about achievement of yourself.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:44.470
Sahaj word has been used by so many saints,
esp by Guru Nanak who says, ‘sahaj samadhi’.

01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:54.150
Whatever you have to get in your awareness
(Samadhi is awareness), has to be in a sahaj

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.800
(means spontaneous) manner.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.880
So for this you don’t have to stand on your
head.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.320
You don’t have to run away from your families.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.910
You don’t have to starve or fast.

01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:06.120
You’ve done it.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.930
You’ve done it in your last lives.

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:18.400
In this life, you should have the fruits of
your hard work that you’ve put in to express

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.500
your desire to be one with the divine.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:29.760
The first truth is that you are not this body,
this mind.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:36.860
These conditionings, this ego, these emotions,
but you are the pure spirit.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:43.900
The second truth is very much evident but
we’re not bothered to know.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:51.500
For example, you see these beautiful flowers,
beautiful trees all around.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.690
It’s a miracle.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.410
See everything is different.

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:59.290
Every seed is different.

01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:00.470
And all flowers are different.

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:02.840
Their fragrance is different.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:08.720
IT’s a miracle that is created but we take
it for granted.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.310
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart.

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:15.900
He’ll say it the autonomous nervous system.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.460
But who is this auto?

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.460
Who is the one?

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.460
Who does it?

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:21.540
They don’t know.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:28.460
At the most they will say it is the autonomous
nervous system.

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:34.640
Beyond these systems, we have this system
here of these three channels.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:44.720
And these three channels, left and right channels,
look after your right and left sympathetic

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:52.470
nervous system, which are responsible on the
right side for your physical and mental activity.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:56.020
On the left hand side, for your emotional
activity.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:14:05.900
In the centre, these two sympathetics, they
form a loop like this and the chakras, the

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.260
centres are created.

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:18.540
These centres are responsible for our physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual being.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:26.470
But when we start exhausting whatever limited
energy it has then we start developing either

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:31.050
physical, mental, emotional or spiritual problems.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:39.100
If somehow we can save these centres from
state of jeopardy we can solve the problem

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:52.410
of physical problem, of mental problem, and
also emotional, spiritual problems.

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:58.110
Now we must tell you that we have cured through
Sahaj Yoga.

01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:05.060
I shouldn’t say we have because it is your
own Kundalini that has done the job.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:13.260
People who suffered from blood cancer; people
who have suffered from lots of incurable diseases;

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:19.270
we don’t have to go through the rigmarole
of horrible diagnoses.

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:23.020
You can diagnose a person on your finger tips.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:29.120
Because these fingertips, 5,6 and 7, are denoting
your centres within yourself.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.120
They get enlightened.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:42.080
So with the light of the spirit when you are
enlightened, you really become an enlightened

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080
person.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.870
It is not just a certificate, I am this , I
am that.

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:50.740
It is something that happens to your awareness.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:57.800
The first thing that happens as I told you:
you go beyond the mind that you become thoughtlessly

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.800
aware.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.710
In Sanskrit, we call it ‘nirvichar samadhi’.

01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:05.970
It is an instant happening.

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:11.050
Maybe the modern times are such that Kundalini
rises like a jet.

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:15.270
And in thousands of people, it has worked.

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:21.300
But to establish that situation of thoughtless
awareness, you have to meditate at the most

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.240
for 10 minutes, in the evening.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.470
But immediately you will feel absolutely peaceful.

01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:34.370
You’ll feel like witness of the whole drama
that is going on, and with that drama you’ll

01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:41.510
be able to see that there’s nothing to be
afraid of, nothing to be worried, because

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:45.860
you are out of that problem, you can solve
it.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:53.500
Like if you are standing in the water, in
the sea, and it is turbulent, you see the

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.280
waves rising higher and higher, you’re frightened.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:08.480
But supposing you can get into a boat then
you can watch the same scene with such attention

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.460
and with enjoyment because you know it cannot
hurt you.

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:20.890
But supposing you can jump into the sea because
you are a great swimmer, you can save many

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:21.890
others.

01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:33.690
So in the second state where you become doubtlessly
aware, you become all powerful, because you

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.500
can give realization to others.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:43.230
Its like one enlightened light or a candle
can light many candles, you can give realization

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:44.480
to many people.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:51.220
They say that Sahaj Yoga is working in 108
countries where I’ve not been.

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.820
I’ve been to many but not so many.

01:17:53.820 --> 01:18:01.850
Only the people who got their realization
went down to all these places and have given

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:04.640
awakening to so many people.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.000
It’s something that is within you.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.720
This kundalini is your own mother.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.770
She’s your individual mother.

01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:15.290
She knows everything about you.

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:19.500
She’s very anxious to give you your self-realisation.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:27.090
As your mother took all the pains when you
were born, she takes all the pain.

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:37.900
She’s so anxious that if she knows that
there is a atmosphere that she can awaken

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:45.490
your inner being, she spontaneously rises
and doesn’t give you any trouble whatsoever.

01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:51.260
It’s a living process of evolution as I
told you.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:58.250
We cannot explain any living process in a
very scientific method because supposing you

01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:06.040
have a seed, and you plant it in the mother
earth, it sprouts.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:16.160
Because the mother earth has got power to
sprout it and the seed has got power to be

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.230
sprouted.

01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.780
It is no effort.

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:32.090
The seed is to be treated with respect and
it has to be planted inside the mother earth.

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:35.650
It is a very simple thing.

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:40.750
Now, people think that how can it be so simple.

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:44.910
For them it should be a very difficult thing.

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:47.840
But everything vital in this world is simple.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.440
For example, our breathing.

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:58.930
Supposing for our breathing we had to do some
or take some lessons, or consult some books,

01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:00.740
what would have happened?

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:07.770
It’s a very vital thing which has to happen
and that’s why it is very simple.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:17.500
I think these are the times I call them as
blossom time, where suddenly so many seekers

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.790
have come and the Kundalini is taking this
form.

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:29.210
Of course, it is predicted also by Kundalini
long time back that such and such thing will

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:30.210
happen.

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:38.870
But still it will happen in such a big proportion
I could never have guessed.

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:41.720
What happens to you when the Kundalini rises?

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:47.780
First of all you feel the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.470
Now what is this cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:57.390
It is the all pervading power of Divine Love.

01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:02.410
This Divine Love is the one which gives you
these flowers.

01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:07.360
Is called also as ‘ritambara pragya’ by
Patanjali.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.730
It is also called as ‘param chaitanya’.

01:21:10.730 --> 01:21:12.860
It is also called as ‘rooh’.

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:19.590
Also it is called as ‘nirakaar’.

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:21.300
You can call it by any name.

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:25.920
in the Bible it is called the all-pervading
power of divine love.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.640
Whatever you may call it.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:36.310
It is something which is an energy around
us which is a very subtle energy.

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:44.940
Which works into every atom and molecule,
into everything, penetrates into anything.

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:50.500
This special energy we have never felt before.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:54.630
For the first time tonight, you are going
to feel it.

01:21:54.630 --> 01:22:02.530
Also this is called as the Last Judgement
because there are people who like to go to

01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:10.240
people who can be bought whom they can pay
money for self-realisation.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:13.420
People who can deceive them.

01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:22.860
People who can tell them stories something
artificial, and they get bound by those permissive

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:27.050
marketing ideas.

01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:31.090
If they’re permissive people like them because
it supports their weaknesses.

01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:35.710
If it is ego-related, they like it because
it boosts their ego.

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.120
So, the judgement is now.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:44.510
It is for you to judge whether you want the
absolute truth or not.

01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:51.190
The difference between Truth and Absolute
Truth is this that Absolute Truth is felt

01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:57.090
by everyone on the Central Nervous System
which we called as ‘bodh’.

01:22:57.090 --> 01:23:00.460
From where the word Buddha has come.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.820
Another one is ‘ved’.

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:09.240
Veda is to know it on your CNS not mentally.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.970
Not on mental level.

01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:13.180
On your fingertips.

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:20.910
And on your fingertips you can find out what
is the Absolute Truth and what is the Relative

01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:21.930
Truth.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:30.940
Supposing you have 10 children who are realized
souls and you tie up their eyes and ask them

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:34.910
to say what is wrong with the person who is
standing before you.

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:43.010
They will all raise the same finger or fingers
which will mean maybe that he has a bad heart

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:45.940
or he has got mental problems.

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:50.760
It can be easily found out what’s wrong
with that person.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:58.160
Now if you know how to correct your centres,
you can also correct the centres of others.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.830
And thus, you can help the whole world.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:07.350
To get emancipated, it’s the thing by which
you are resurrected.

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:13.010
Again I would say Mohammad Sahab has said
though he didn’t write Quran but there are

01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:19.920
lots of things left behind somehow, that your
hands will speak at the time of resurrection,

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.980
at the time of ‘qiyamah’.

01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:26.670
This is exactly what happens that you can
feel on your ends of your fingertips your

01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:30.870
centres and centres of others.

01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:39.010
Because you get into a new dimension of your
awareness which we call as collective consciousness.

01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:42.340
Become collectively conscious.

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:50.030
Sitting down here you can know the vibrations
of another person.

01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:52.200
You can know what’s wrong with that person.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.100
Even if he’s dead, you can know about it.

01:24:55.100 --> 01:25:02.670
It’s very interesting how you become full
knowledgeable and after some time you will

01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:08.440
be amazed that you can even tell the future
of a person.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:17.940
It’s very simple because if you become a
saint of that level, what is future and what

01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:19.210
is past.

01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:23.620
it’s all absolutely in your brain already
built-in.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:30.900
Only thing is that you are not open to it
so far, but with the light of the spirit everything

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.460
opens up in your brain.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:38.200
I’ve seen children who are very dull in
class who were brought today because they

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.600
were hopelessly bad, failing all the time.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.240
Stood first, got scholarships.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:51.050
And most of the students from Sahaj Yoga I’ve
seen are always breaking the records everywhere.

01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:55.160
If this is the advantage only, I would have
said it’s all right, it’s alright, it’s

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160
nothing great.

01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:06.450
But the greatest advantage I think is that
your personality moves to totality, you get

01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:08.280
your identification.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.610
See people have no identity.

01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:17.570
Why these people paint their heads and wear
funny dresses because they want to express

01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:19.340
their identity.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:26.790
Your identity is within yourself, is your
spirit and once you know your spirit you will

01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:29.690
be amazed how dynamic you are.

01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:37.170
I’ve known many artists who were very ordinary
artists in India specially.

01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:40.860
You know Amjad Ali was a ordinary artist.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:44.430
After coming to Sahaj Yoga he has become such
a great artist.

01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:46.830
Safat, Hussain, so many of them.

01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:52.260
Because I am telling you, you don’t have
to believe it, you can ask them.

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:56.810
There are so many people like this who have
achieved a lot.

01:26:56.810 --> 01:27:01.480
There are many who could never speak a word
on the stage that the stage fear.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.530
They have become great orators and speakers.

01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:08.430
They’ve become free to express themselves.

01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:15.410
Then we have people who have become Chartered
Accountants, who have never known what is

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:23.010
language is, what is the beauty of poetries,
they’ve become great poets.

01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:27.900
Like this so many things have happened to
people but we don’t want to publicize and

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.470
we don’t want to give it in the newspapers.

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:39.450
We don’t allow people to talk about it because
that is not the main thing you have to achieve.

01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:40.700
Firstly, you are collectively conscious.

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:48.120
But when you become collectively conscious,
you don’t react, because you know if a person

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.090
is trying to be harsh with you, you know why
he’s harsh.

01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:57.640
If a person is trying to be nice with you,
you know why he is; because you know you do

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.840
not react, you just watch.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.430
And this watching is something like your attention
being directed towards the problem.

01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:11.450
This attention when directed towards that
problem, acts.

01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:12.450
It acts.

01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:19.740
It’s not just an attention that goes out
but it works out things.

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:26.890
So many miracles have taken place in Sahaj
Yoga that it is impossible to understand this

01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:30.100
all-pervading power how it is working.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:34.640
As I say it is ruta yuga.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.120
Kalyug is about to finish and ruta yuga has
started.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:47.790
Rut Yuga means the one in which this Param
Chaitanya, this all-pervading power is acting.

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:53.930
It is acting, it acts in so many ways that
you are surprised at the miracles it has created.

01:28:53.930 --> 01:29:00.050
It’s not the time I could tell you about
this but those who are here who have got their

01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:05.690
realization have been blessed by Sahaj Yoga
can tell each one of them lots of things that

01:29:05.690 --> 01:29:13.050
they have seen that has happened to them,
and how their lives were transformed.

01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:16.360
This transformation is very important today.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:23.450
With this transformation, people lose the
sense of greed.

01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:29.280
You know nowadays this greed has brought politicians
to such a level.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.840
It is so stupid to have this greed.

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.090
The satisfaction part comes in through Sahaj
Yoga.

01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:45.740
As you know there is a law of economics that
in general wants are not satiable.

01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:49.710
Today I want to buy a car, then I don’t
enjoy it.

01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:52.870
I want to have a house, I don’t enjoy it.

01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:59.350
Then I want to have an aeroplane, I don’t
enjoy it.

01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:03.480
Because, we don’t know what we want!

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:09.060
We run after these things one after another
like mad and the greed starts working to such

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:18.790
a stupid limit that people want to put all
this money into the vaults, they want to have

01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:20.120
vaults of money.

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:28.690
And the stupidity goes to that limit, not
only greed, then also the jealousies we have.

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:38.040
Because we think that the people who are with
us are not the people who should be there,

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:44.600
or we should supersede them or we should be
at a higher position.

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:47.690
Actually, there is no love, no compassion.

01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:50.210
There’s no understanding of another person.

01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:57.340
But when Sahaj Yoga takes place, I have seen
thousands of people whether they are from

01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:04.670
Russia, from England, America, Australia,
anywhere, I’ve seen them thousands together,

01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:12.190
they live together, they feel each other,
they understand each other, and the love they

01:31:12.190 --> 01:31:15.500
have for each other is tremendous.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:21.650
If something happens to someone anywhere in
the world, the whole society you can call

01:31:21.650 --> 01:31:30.220
it, you can call the nations where Sahaj Yogis
are there, they are so concerned, as they

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:34.090
would not normally be even about their brothers.

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:35.370
All kinds of help.

01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:37.810
All kinds of suggestions come in.

01:31:37.810 --> 01:31:40.310
Doctors will run through they’ll come up.

01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:43.440
IT’s such a big society.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.410
Such a big moral relationships that starts.

01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:49.210
Every body helps.

01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:52.570
But that doesn’t mean one will become…

01:31:52.570 --> 01:32:05.420
(Only possible in Australia I tell you.

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:13.730
If you’re interested in your well-being,
in your transformation, you must have some

01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:20.430
patience, otherwise how is it going to work
out.

01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:26.590
On the contrary, I have seen in Russia, there
are never less than 16-18 thousand people,

01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:29.180
and not one person would leave.

01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.560
After all what is so great about that.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.680
I can’t understand.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:41.050
We are in a democratic country and we have
got freedom to do whatever we like all right!

01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:45.300
But what about the freedom to wisdom.

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:46.980
To understanding.

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:53.610
Russians I think are people, of course communism
or anything I am not very much for favour

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:54.610
of it.

01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:55.610
But one thing.

01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:57.110
They haven’t developed that possessiveness.

01:32:57.110 --> 01:33:00.700
They’re not possessive.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:07.420
They’re so sweet that their government gave
them their houses.

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.790
And they said you can have these houses.

01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:12.290
These flats you can have them your own.

01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:16.590
We don’t want to have it, you can have it.

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:22.090
Apart from that, you see once I was there,
there was a coup, and I asked them aren’t

01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:23.090
you worried?

01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:24.090
There’s a coup on!

01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:25.090
And all these things happening.

01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:26.650
They said, Mother, Why should we?

01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:30.650
We are in the kingdom of God.

01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:36.930
I was surprised at their positive understanding
of themselves.

01:33:36.930 --> 01:33:40.200
That’s what you are.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:41.820
You’re so powerful within.

01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:44.360
You’re so dynamic within.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.580
It’s such a treasure within you.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:52.460
You’ve not known your glory which you have
to.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:57.690
Once you know that you become satisfied with
yourself to begin with.

01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:02.050
but that doesn’t mean that you become poor
or financially disturbed.

01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:03.420
Not at all!

01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:10.610
On the contrary, I have seen now in Australia
itself, people who have come to Sahaj Yoga

01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:15.280
are all very well employed, very happy people.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.220
It all works out because your attention becomes
enlightened.

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.410
Attention becomes concentrated.

01:34:22.410 --> 01:34:24.580
Doesn’t flit around.

01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.340
Doesn’t take your mind here and there.

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:30.830
And you see the right thing at the right time.

01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:36.040
You become a personality of great penetration.

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:42.170
You don’t do anything as such in the sense
that you don’t react, but the attention

01:34:42.170 --> 01:34:45.930
itself acts and works for you.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:52.060
You must know that we’re not only ordinary
human beings.

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:57.770
And as great saints, they’re nothing, they
were not even some of them educated people,

01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:04.680
but what was so great about them that they
were one with the divine power.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:10.430
They had this power flowing through you and
they were so dynamic, and you could see the

01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:12.540
dynamism in them.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:18.180
This is with your attention it happens.

01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.720
You know the absolute truth.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.150
If you know the absolute truth, then how can
there be a quarrel.

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:28.860
Supposing all of you know I am sitting down
here, now you won’t fight on that issue

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.280
whether I am here or not.

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.690
Because everyone is seeing the same thing.

01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:41.120
So if you all know absolute truth you see,
then there is no question of argument.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.120
No question of discussion.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.700
But everybody will know the same thing.

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:55.030
That’s how there cannot be any wars if all
the people believe in the same thing.

01:35:55.030 --> 01:36:01.170
Of course in every country we have lots of
Sahaj Yogis, I must say.

01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:06.690
And there are also some politicians in Sahaj
Yoga.

01:36:06.690 --> 01:36:07.690
Some.

01:36:07.690 --> 01:36:16.910
If it reaches the helm of affairs, I’m sure,
a day will come that people will give up the

01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:20.200
idea of war completely.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:27.580
No question having any war or any struggle,
any fight, or anybody putting up atomic bombs

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:30.490
around.

01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:38.730
It all comes from the ignorance and the blindness
of people who do not see that we are part

01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:41.330
and parcel of the whole.

01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:49.150
But when it happens to you that you become
one with the divine, then you’re like a

01:36:49.150 --> 01:36:51.730
little drop dissolved into the ocean.

01:36:51.730 --> 01:36:55.030
Ocean of joy.

01:36:55.030 --> 01:37:02.080
Now joy is not like happiness and unhappiness.

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.510
It is singular.

01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:11.490
Once we jump into the ocean of joy everything
is a joy.

01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:14.760
If it ridiculous, you laugh at it.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.170
If it is sublime, you enjoy it.

01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:28.830
And the whole personality becomes so beautiful
and vibrant that it absorbs everything that

01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:29.950
is constructive.

01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:32.960
All that is destructive is dropped off.

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:40.170
You’ll be amazed that in Sahaj Yoga 50%
people in the West who had taken to drugs,

01:37:40.170 --> 01:37:41.390
have dropped off.

01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:45.810
who had taken to destructive methods, have
finished with it.

01:37:45.810 --> 01:37:50.680
So many destructive habits which they could
not give up, have been completely given up

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.520
by them.

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:56.800
This is not because of any compulsion.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:04.080
Without any discipline, or force but your
own power of spirit makes you your own master

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:11.030
your own Guru and you see in the light of
the spirit what is good for you what is bad

01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:12.030
for you.

01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:13.590
Nobody has to tell you about it.

01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:14.990
It just happens.

01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:18.990
Now you saw these people these western people
singing.

01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:27.510
It’s a Marathi song written by Ramdeva,
in the 16th century all over villagers also

01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:28.510
sing

01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:33.420
The way they were pronouncing you’ll be
amazed I mean nobody can pronounce.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:38.350
It is very difficult for Western people to
pronounce our difficult tongue twister languages,

01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:44.620
but they are the ones who have picked up not
only the language but also the music.

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:52.700
We’re surprised from Romania, three boys
came in 2 months’ time they started singing

01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.670
qawwali just like Nusrat Jahan.

01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:58.170
We were surprised how good they take to it.

01:38:58.170 --> 01:38:59.170
So easily.

01:38:59.170 --> 01:39:02.390
I mean you just become like a genius.

01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:06.090
In every walk of life it becomes so different.

01:39:06.090 --> 01:39:13.230
Your stress and strain all these things drop
off because now you are connected with the

01:39:13.230 --> 01:39:21.910
all-pervading power of Divine Love which guides
you, which works for you, which helps you,

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:23.280
all the time.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:30.580
It’s a blissful existence which is your
birth right which you should have.

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:38.670
In one lecture of course you cannot tell all
about you because it’s very very deep down

01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:39.670
within you.

01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:43.090
All these things are sprouting and existing.

01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:48.550
But once you get your realization you have
to know that now you have become a collective

01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:53.680
being for which I must say that you can’t
do as you are doing meditation at home.

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.200
You have to come to the collective.

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.960
Today it’s a collective happening.

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:00.810
I’m talking of global transformation.

01:40:00.810 --> 01:40:04.380
For that this collective happening has to
take place.

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:14.250
Thus we can avoid all the struggles, all the
strife, and all the horrible wars completely.

01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:17.510
There is no compulsion for anything.

01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:23.480
You yourself know what is good for you and
what is bad for you.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:29.390
I hope today you all get your realization
, you will, if you desire.

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:31.900
Definitely you’ll all get your realization.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:32.900
No doubt.

01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:41.630
But then you should not allow yourself to
be just blown off for a while and then again

01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:43.230
you don’t develop yourself.

01:40:43.230 --> 01:40:47.100
It’s like a seed that grows into a tree.

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:51.410
You all have to grow into a tree which is
not difficult, especially Australians have

01:40:51.410 --> 01:41:01.040
a speciality I have seen, they can grow very
fast into their ascent in very simple way

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:07.130
and luckily we have very good centres here,
very very good Sahaj Yogis.

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:14.150
It’s working very well and I’m sure you
are all going to enjoy your realization and

01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:15.150
your growth.

01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:17.580
For that you have to come to collective.

01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:24.730
Of course we don’t have elaborate arrangements
and things like that because we don’ believe

01:41:24.730 --> 01:41:26.550
in publicity or marketing.

01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:34.100
It is your desire that you have to come humbly
and get to know all about it.

01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:42.140
It is not mental knowledge but it is the knowledge
on your Central nervous system.

01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:44.060
So many things are happening here.

01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:51.480
I was told also that a wing has been given
in some hospital in Australia, maybe in Sydeny,

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:56.260
where people could be treated by Sahaj Yoga,
for which you don’t have to take medicines,

01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:59.950
you don’t have to pay to the doctors, nothing.

01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:05.030
That’s one thing one should know you can’t
pay for God.

01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:06.030
You can’t.

01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:07.090
God doesn’t understand money.

01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:09.800
He doesn’t understand bank.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:16.400
He has no idea about what all these things
we have done to ourselves.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:23.540
So best thing is to remember that only you
have to give some respect to your self-realisation.

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:24.540
Respect yourself.

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:29.510
Love and compassion for yourself And forgive
yourself.

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:37.740
That’s one of the ways we can really understand
that we are human beings at the epitome of

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.820
evolution and we have to achieve this in our
lifetime.

01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:48.020
It is such a tremendous luck that at this
time at this juncture you are here.

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:57.480
To get your realization and grow into it.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:12.200
May god bless you!

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.460
it will hardly take 10 minutes.

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:20.980
Hardly 10 minutes to get your realization.

01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:22.780
But I would request those who want to go to
go now.

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:27.510
You should not disturb others later on.

01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:32.590
It will be better that they go now.

01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:43.240
If you want Sahaj Yoga, you want to have your
ascent, then please you should not disturb

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.660
others.

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:51.470
Stay here and follow few things that I am
going to tell you.

01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:54.000
It’s very simple as I told you.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.200
IT has to work fast.

01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.350
It has worked very fast these days.

01:43:59.350 --> 01:44:08.670
I was amazed, that in Shivaji Park there were
60-70 thousand people and it worked out in

01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:09.670
5 minutes.

01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:12.890
I was amazed how things work out these days.

01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:16.570
It is getting faster and faster.

01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:36.380
First, it used to take hours together, but
not now.

01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:40.600
There are conditions which are very simple.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:46.410
First as I told you please forgive yourself.

01:44:46.410 --> 01:44:50.080
People must have told you that you are a sinner
or that this is wrong that is wrong and we

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.090
develop guilt.

01:44:51.090 --> 01:44:57.670
Also it is a fashion I think to develop a
guilt for everything.

01:44:57.670 --> 01:45:02.210
Now supposing we do not follow any norms of
modern life.

01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:05.030
There are also some stupid norms you see.

01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:10.370
And if you don’t follow anyone of them,
then you start feeling guilty.

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:12.930
I should have done this, I should have done
that.

01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:17.630
But we don’t know how we harm ourselves
by feeling guilty.

01:45:17.630 --> 01:45:22.970
The centre on the left hand side, gets into
problem.

01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:30.460
When this centre gets into problem minimum
of minimum you might develop spondylitis on

01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:32.660
the physical side.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:38.810
Then we might develop the disease called hearts
disease, angina.

01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:48.310
Then also we might get all our organs in the
viscera, all the organs can become very lethargic.

01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:55.700
So to feel guilty is also a nonsense if you
see because whatever mistake you have committed

01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:56.870
is past.

01:45:56.870 --> 01:46:02.740
At that time you should have corrected it
but what sense of now feeling guilty about

01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:08.000
it and torturing yourself.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.710
Whatever you have done is finished and gone.

01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:15.680
At least for Mother, the son is never guilty.

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:25.420
In the same way, in the eyes of god you are
not guilty.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:30.500
So you have to say in your heart – you can
call me Mother or Sri Mataji, Mother I am

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:33.100
not guilty at all.

01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:42.770
The another simple thing to do is as you have
forgiven yourself forgive everyone.

01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:48.220
Even without thinking about them.

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:53.460
Because logically whether you have forgiven
or not you have done nothing.

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:56.070
I don’t forgive means what.

01:46:56.070 --> 01:47:05.740
Means that I am torturing myself all the time
all my life for somebody who is enjoying himself.

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:12.310
We play into wrong hands if we don’t forgive.

01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:14.210
But by that what happens to our chakras.

01:47:14.210 --> 01:47:23.560
That this centre in the crossing of the optic
chiasm is like this is absolutely constricted.

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.870
Absolutely constricted.

01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:29.680
And unless and until you don’t forgive it
won’t open at all and the Kundalini cannot

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.680
cross over.

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:34.730
This is the last barrier we have.

01:47:34.730 --> 01:47:42.680
So just forget and forgive all the people
in general if you want.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:43.860
Don’t think about them.

01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:48.710
Because that is also a headache to remember
whom you have to forgive.

01:47:48.710 --> 01:47:51.250
They don’t deserve that attention.

01:47:51.250 --> 01:47:57.350
So just forgive altogether, you will feel
lighter even now immediately if you just forgive

01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:58.670
everyone.

01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:02.710
These are the two conditions.

01:48:02.710 --> 01:48:05.110
I don’t think are so difficult.

01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:10.740
Third one is you have to take out your shoes.

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:18.030
But I hope you don’t mind because in England
first time when I said you have to take out

01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:24.840
your shoes half of them walked out.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:28.540
Why shoes because this Mother Earth helps
us a lot.

01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:30.380
She sucks in our problems.

01:48:30.380 --> 01:49:01.210
When you’re your socks on it doesn’t matter.

01:49:01.210 --> 01:49:03.620
Now you know that these five are sympathetic.

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:24.010
Now you please put these hands towards me
like this.

01:49:24.010 --> 01:49:32.870
Just like this.

01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:48.760
Please put your right hand towards me like
this and the left hand on top of the fontanel

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:56.550
bone area (tadu) which was the soft bone on
top of your head.

01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:58.420
Now put down your head.

01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:03.230
Now please don’t put it on top.

01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:06.520
But away from it.

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.330
Now see for yourself.

01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:11.900
Please put down your head.

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:19.840
If you want you can take out your spectacles.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:29.450
Now see for yourself if there’s a cool or
hot breeze like vibrations are coming out

01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:33.060
of your fontanel bone area.

01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:35.240
Some people get it a little far away.

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:37.280
Some get it quite close.

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.640
Now don’t feel guilty.

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:46.030
I can feel your centres out of which this
guilty business is quite a lot.

01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:52.870
If it is hot then you should know that you
have not forgiven yourself and or you have

01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:54.610
not forgiven others.

01:50:54.610 --> 01:50:57.250
So please forgive now.

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:58.430
You can move your hand.

01:50:58.430 --> 01:51:00.520
It may be close to your head.

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.310
It might be away from it.

01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:03.310
Depends on.

01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:07.860
And move your hand and see for yourself.

01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:10.840
Now please put left hand towards me.

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:21.140
And please put down your head and see for
yourself on top of your head on the fontanel

01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:25.530
bone area which was the soft bone in your
childhood.

01:51:25.530 --> 01:51:30.490
See for yourself if there is a cool or a hot
breeze coming out of your head.

01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:32.990
Out of your head.

01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:43.200
Here again I will request you to forgive yourself
and to forgive others.

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:44.370
Please.

01:51:44.370 --> 01:51:49.090
That will definitely help.

01:51:49.090 --> 01:51:50.270
Now.

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:53.350
Please take your right hand towards me.

01:51:53.350 --> 01:52:00.660
And now see for yourself with your left hand
on top of your head if there’s a cool or

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:16.030
a hot breeze like vibrations

01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:17.030
are coming.

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:18.030
Actually, you have to desire it.

01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:21.340
It is not meant for arrogant people.

01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:24.890
But meant for humble who want to have their
self-realisation.

01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:34.490
You have to humble down.

01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:41.920
Now please put both your hands towards the
sky like this and put back your head.

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.150
Push back.

01:52:43.150 --> 01:52:48.750
Here you have to ask a question in your heart
three times.

01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:52.230
Any one of these questions you can ask.

01:52:52.230 --> 01:52:53.230
Three times.

01:52:53.230 --> 01:52:57.290
Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost?

01:52:57.290 --> 01:53:02.130
Or Mother is this the all-pervading power
of Divine Love?

01:53:02.130 --> 01:53:07.810
Or Mother is this the Param Chaitanya?

01:53:07.810 --> 01:53:14.300
Ask any one of these questions three times.

01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:16.730
In your heart.

01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:22.400
Push back your head and your hands.

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:27.280
Now please take down your hands.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:35.620
Now, if you can put both your hands towards
me like this and watch me without thinking.

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:43.250
Just watch me without thinking.

01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:44.500
Some people are getting it here.

01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:47.930
So you can push it up if they are getting
down here.

01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:52.610
Just push it up.

01:53:52.610 --> 01:54:00.790
Watch me without thinking.

01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:06.960
All those who have felt cool breeze on the
fingertips or in the centre of the palm or

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:16.460
out of the fontanel bone area, whether hot
or cool, please raise both your hands.

01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:22.360
My goodness!

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:31.770
I bow to you all of you have felt it which
is very great experience for me.

01:54:31.770 --> 01:54:33.850
So may God bless you all.

01:54:33.850 --> 01:54:37.140
Now your saintly life has started.

01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:39.120
So be careful.

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:44.450
You don’t have to give up anything outside.

01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:47.930
You don’t have to renounce anything.

01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:54.730
Everything there and you have become a saint.

01:54:54.730 --> 01:55:03.580
So please respect your self-realisation and
develop it so that you can help yourself and

01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:07.280
help everyone around.

01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:14.620
I must tell you I was surprised that there
was a good centre started in Israel.

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:19.290
And the people who started were Germans and
Austrians.

01:55:19.290 --> 01:55:29.850
IT was such a feeling of joy for me that look
at these Germans they feel responsible for

01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:34.830
the Jews they have gone to Israel to give
them their realisation.

01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:37.650
Such love and such compassion.

01:55:37.650 --> 01:55:44.740
Such transformation that you will enjoy your
virtues you will enjoy yourself.

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:53.380
May God bless you all.

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:59.570
I will like our school children to sing one
song so that they will see for themselves

01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:14.280
how they have picked up if there are here.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:19.560
Are there our school children here?

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:22.730
Have we got?

01:56:22.730 --> 01:56:25.890
No not here.

01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:26.950
Any?

01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:30.120
Come here then.

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:42.800
‘Sabko aane nahi diya shayad’ (Perhaps
they were not allowed to come).

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.020
Yes yes come along.

01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:50.180
Nothing like children.

01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:53.810
We have to learn so much from them.

01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:55.260
Alright.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:59.600
Come and join.

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:02.510
Come forward.

01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:09.460
All the little girls should sit in front.

01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:13.060
And the little boys.

01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:17.560
‘Samne aao’ [Hindi] (come forward).

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:18.560
Yes.

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:19.360
Good.
