00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.840
I’m very joyous today

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.800
to see all of you celebrating My Birthday,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.000
as well as having the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.820
national program same day.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.820
It’s a good combination we have, in the month of March.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.950
Is regarded as springtime in India – Madhumas,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.030
that’s what you sing, Madhumas.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.800
And as you know, twenty-first March is the equinox,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.040
so it sort of is a balance,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.020
and also the center of all the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.040
signs you have in the horoscope.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.010
So many centers I had to achieve,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.830
and also I was born on

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.930
the Tropic of Cancer

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.860
as you are on the Tropic of Capricorn,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.800
and Ayers Rock is on the Tropic of Capricorn,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.940
just in the center.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.010
So many combinations had to be worked out.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.970
So the principle of ascent

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.890
is to be in the center,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.880
to be in the balance,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.000
to be in the maryadas of the center.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.820
To be in the boundaries of the center is the principle.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.010
So what happens when we do not keep to the boundaries,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.010
to the maryadas?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.810
Then we get caught up.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.900
If we keep to maryadas we can never be caught up.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.940
Many people say, “Why have the maryadas?”

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.010
Say we have the maryadas,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.820
the boundaries of this beautiful ashram here

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.830
and somebody is attacking you from all the sides,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.930
on all the sides of the void,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.030
so if you go out of the void you get caught up.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.910
That’s why you have to keep to the boundaries,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.820
and to keep to the boundaries is difficult

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.950
when you have two problems:

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.910
one is the ego, another is the superego.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.040
Now as in the West superego is not such a problem.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.980
Ego is the problem, and it has very,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.920
very subtle implications now,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.980
I can see the complicated styles of egos we have.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.020
One is a gross,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.920
like Khomeini style, which is dry,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.020
is obvious, evident, everybody can condemn.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.990
That one is the one,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.970
either one corrects or gets completely destroyed.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.860
But ego, if it is of a stupid person,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.820
then he behaves in this manner,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.850
only that he doesn’t know

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.970
how to hide his ego in sophistication.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.040
But the Western ego is extremely sophisticated;

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.880
the language, everything, is very sophisticated.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.950
Like in English language we’ll say,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.870
“I’m afraid I have to slap you.”

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.840
“I’m sorry I have to kill you.”

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.800
It’s such a devious thing,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.800
you see, once you’ve said “I’m sorry”

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.970
that means you have put a chocolate

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.880
on top of that, isn’t it?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.820
Such a camouflage, must understand.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.820
See we must face as we are,

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.870
we cannot be facing something else.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.850
But this is exactly what happens with sophistication,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.860
that we avoid facing ourselves.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.930
Today though the day is of celebration

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.000
so in all humor we should understand

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.820
what this stupid thing called ego is.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.870
In all humor, not in seriousness,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.800
for I don’t want you again to feel guilty.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.800
Now as I was explaining in the morning

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.040
how ego becomes the Left Vishuddhi.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.970
I mean even before going to the hall,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.940
My attention on the hall, I get a big lump here

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.800
- just, just painful horrible, excruciating.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.930
I mean all the time it has been there

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.980
since I’ve been in the West. Can you imagine?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.980
It has never vanished.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.820
So this chakra is all the time working,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.950
poor thing is so much now tired, Vishnumaya’s chakra.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.960
So what happens really,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.890
we should see the physical side of it,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.980
it’s very important to understand.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.840
You see from childhood if we are taught

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.990
in a society like this, where you are an extrovert,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.880
you have to achieve something,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.860
some success or this and that,

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.830
then the idea of strength is given to you,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.950
that it is weakness to tolerate something.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.860
Imagine in Christian nations that’s the best part of it,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.910
“I’m sorry I will kill you,” sort of a thing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.820
In Christian nation, you see, they have this thing, theory

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.860
that it is weakness that if you tolerate anything.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.860
It is a weakness if you get dominated by someone.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.930
You can never be successful if you do like that.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.990
So unless and until you are possessed

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.850
you can never be obedient.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.820
This is what it is.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.800
Somebody has to possess you,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.920
absolutely possess you like Hitler,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.000
then you can be obedient;

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.900
otherwise everybody has a big ego,

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.830
as I had told you the story of the garbage cleaner.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.040
So everybody has a very, very big ego,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.030
everybody wants to have their own way,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.840
and from childhood you spoil your children too much,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.960
you spoil them, completely spoil them.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.840
All the time you‘ll hug them, you’ll hold them,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.860
you’ll do too much, children get spoiled.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.810
Think no end of themselves and then on top of that,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.020
if you tell them that you should not tolerate anything,

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.800
they become disobedient.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.990
So you do not know how to obey others in any way.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.960
Ego does not know how to obey, because that is weakness,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.880
obedience is weakness.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:34.990
So now this poor thing ego has a limited, limited thing.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.860
That is, this ego has a balloon, which is limited.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.030
But it bursts when you get your paralysis

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.980
and all those things it does burst,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.900
but it is flexible also.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.930
So when the ego starts getting too much on top of the

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.830
superego, then the superego

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.030
can go up to a point, it is also there.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.990
So to get rid of the ego people take drinks,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.930
drugs just to push it back

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.940
so, increase the superego so the ego comes down.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.980
So you are playing between, then you have a hangover,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.940
then it goes on like this, you see, works out.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:34.970
This is the modern solution they find for ego, all right.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.980
Otherwise ego is too much.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.850
So when somebody says something to you,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.870
instead of facing up to it

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.880
- supposing you find you have not been able to, say,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.820
find a glass for Me, a simple thing like, take it like that.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.810
You sulk. Why? Why should you sulk for that?

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.880
Because there’s another place

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.870
where this ego can go is when you come round,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.850
you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.000
so when it is suppressed from the other side

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.990
it goes into that Vishuddhi part.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.940
So then you get the Left Vishuddhi,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.800
it is nothing but pure ego. Believe Me, it’s pure ego,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.810
because it has no other way to get in, it goes there

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.860
and that’s how you sulk and think.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.800
Think so you get more ego,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.850
you fill up your left side and you sulk, you never face.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.930
Now, the practical way

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.950
the central path is established by being in reality.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.860
Now as a matter of habit you must develop.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.950
Supposing something has gone wrong,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.880
tell yourself, “Yes it has gone wrong,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.800
because I’ve done the mistake.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.990
All right, why did I do the mistake?

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.040
Because of this, so next time no.”

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.880
But very easy, avoid everything,

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.960
come to this and enjoy your ego feeling sad.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.880
Is an indulgence.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.960
And others also feel, “Oh, he’s felt

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.860
‘I’m sorry I’ve killed you,’ you see.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.910
He feels sorry for it.”

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.860
Yes I’ve seen, it is gone so far

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.960
in the minds of the Western people

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.000
that there are laws which really forgive people

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.850
who should never be forgiven.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.860
They also try to forgive people

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.910
because of this left nonsensical Vishuddhi

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.030
which indulges into the left side,

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.820
you feel sympathy for such people,

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.980
who should not have been forgiven.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.040
Like there’s one fellow who has murdered so many people,

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.040
put them into gas chambers, this thing.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.020
He’s arrested now, he’s a liability now,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.880
big liability as a prisoner kept somewhere

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.990
because they had to keep everything very much closed,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.040
and this and that.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.940
So to maintain such a dog there

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.800
was very difficult for English people,

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.810
but they are maintaining this one prisoner.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.030
I’ve forgotten his name, horrible fellow whosoever it is.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.850
Now he has been there, he’s old, this thing

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.920
- let him die there, what is there to have pity?

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.900
Just hang him out and finish. He has killed so many people.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.930
No, but how can you do that.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.980
You must keep this doggy there

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.830
though he’s consuming the money of all the people,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.010
though he has killed thousands and thousands

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.860
and thousands in gas chamber.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.890
He’s been such a horrid fellow there should be no sympathy,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.910
in the Divine Laws he would be finished in no time.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.920
He’s dissipating every day,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.820
but even now I read articles in sympathy with him.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.920
“Now what is he going to do wrong? Why not leave him alone?”

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.920
This is how you play in to the hands

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.830
of horrible people by your Left Vishuddhi, first of all.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.980
So this Left Vishuddhi is nothing but purely,

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.940
purely ego and then you bend your head like that,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.890
you walk like this.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.990
Now with this Left Vishuddhi though you have many,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.850
many physical problems,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.970
but the worst of all will be lunacy.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.800
The other day somebody told Me that

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.800
at the age of forty years now in America,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.990
people are suddenly becoming lunatic

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.830
and it’s a very big sickness,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.860
just like they have it in

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.880
that horrible disease called AIDS,

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.990
in that way it is spreading.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.000
Now I must tell you as your Mother, very clearly,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:06.890
that this is the part this horrible Left Vishuddhi plays.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.880
Do not indulge into it.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.840
If you have an ego, that’s why it’s Left Vishuddhi,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.940
face up to yourself.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.930
Like today Warren’s idea was that he came and told Me that

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.880
“In India when we go, we think that

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.810
the people whatever we suggest first start with ‘No, no.’ ”

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.810
So you see actually that “No, no,”

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.850
is because we are brought up a different way,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.880
you see - to face up to it, we are brought up to it.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.850
That’s why Indians are never guilty.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.030
If they are guilty know that they are westernized.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.890
They’re never guilty.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.020
So now at that time when they say, “No” to something,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.020
ninety nine percent, not the people who are in the cities,

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.820
they are same style of (?)

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.010
because you have blessed them nicely, but in the villages.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.890
You see they tell themselves,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.020
“No, no, how I could have done it?

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.960
All right, if I have done it I better correct it.”

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.890
“No, no,” it starts with “No, no.”

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.870
But a Western person might hear this “No, no”

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.980
and he’ll think, “He’s just punching my ego.”

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.970
Because still that ego is there to dominate others,

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.820
still this ego thinks they are much better organizers,

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.800
still this one thinks they are cleaner people than others,

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.940
they are higher people than others.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.930
All this ego thinks like that, you see,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.840
and builds you up and you live on top, you see,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.850
like a balloon or a ring that is bloated

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.830
you keep on the surface,

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.840
and that’s why don’t want the air to get out,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.020
because you know, you'll sink into yourself.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.860
So one lives on that

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.860
and you start thinking you know it better,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.040
anybody says anything to you, one feels hurt,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.030
again Left Vishuddhi.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.950
If Mother says anything, again Left Vishuddhi.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:03.890
So you have all ready made a pouch there being in the West;

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.800
we should face as we are.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.820
Now that pouch is there so anything I say,

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.000
now even if I’m saying now, you should not feel guilty.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.000
Let’s see, not feel guilty.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.890
Be on your Spirit so you see yourself

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.010
and you can clear out.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.980
If you see from your Spirit’s angle you clear out

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.880
that which you have been accumulating since long.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.940
Left Vishuddhi is the problem today of the West I tell you.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.950
All these problems are coming from Left Vishuddhi,

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.980
but which is not in no way is that they’re subdued,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.820
on the contrary any moment

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.840
this Left Vishuddhi can blow in again into the ego.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.840
You see, I’ve seen this in the West very common,

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.030
people are walking straight forward everything is all right.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.910
Even in the cities of India we have seen it

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.810
- you make them into trustees,

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.950
suddenly they jump on the horse.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.910
I said, “From where did they jump in the horse,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.870
from where did this ego come?”

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.040
That was all stored up here you see,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.930
as soon as they become trustees the whole thing comes back

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.900
and they are sitting like John Gilpin on a horse

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.970
going fast and I start looking at them,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.880
where are they going?

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.930
They were just there, disappeared,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.990
vanishing tricks.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.960
Just can’t understand why it happens.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.870
But after penetrating into the problems,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.910
because I see just going to the hall

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.880
you get the Left Vishuddhi.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.020
But look at the children,

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.830
you see from childhood you don’t teach them

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.800
all the time say, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.970
Our Parsees in India

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.970
have very much affectation from you, very much.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.810
So in the morning we never want to see a Parsee

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.870
because early in the morning he’ll come and start saying,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.040
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” This is inauspicious.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.950
“Maafkaro, Maafkaro,” you see people say,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.040
“Baba, you come in the afternoon, this is not the time,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.900
morning time don’t start with this.”

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.830
We don’t say like this, is inauspicious.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.020
You open the door somebody standing,

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.990
“Maafkaro,” for what, what have I done?

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.030
What have you done that you are saying like this,

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.860
all the time in an apologetic mood you see, for what?

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.960
You see, you don’t want to see an apologetic face

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.810
in the morning time do you?

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.810
Something pleasant, nice coming to greet you, here this

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.010
“Maafkaro, maafkaro, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.840
It’s a very common thing

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.040
that we don’t want to see a Parsee in the morning,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.800
the reason is this: you see, if you see them in the morning

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.940
the whole day you are in a bad state,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.860
you have seen somebody apologetic.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.830
But it is not apology, they are extremely egotistical people.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.970
If you study their character, they’re very egotistical.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.890
So this one has to understand:

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.810
that when we start dealing with our ego

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.820
we, must directly deal with it.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.950
We are not ego, we are the Spirit. Directly.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:09.830
“Oh I see. So it was wrong, so it was done by not me,

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.880
by this body, now come along, no, no, better be all right.”

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.900
You tell yourself, “No, no better be all right.”

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.030
That’s how we are going to deal with it,

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.000
because you see this is what is frightening Me

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.960
is this Left Vishuddhi.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.800
Because when I thought of this disease,

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.870
My attention went to Left Vishuddhi.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.830
Imagine people becoming lunatic.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.870
And most of the egotistical people I find

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.030
become stupid because of that.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.800
They are stupid, they behave stupidly, they behave stupidly.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.830
And the egotistical people only take to drugs

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.000
and to drink so much because they can stand it.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.970
Supposing a person who is very superego,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.880
supposing a man who is possessed takes to drinks,

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.870
he’ll die very soon, he won’t live

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.990
because he’s thrown more that side.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.890
But the egotistical people can stand, I mean,

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.040
a person who is not egotistical, like an Indian

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.000
if he takes a vodka he’ll be blown off the shores,

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.810
absolutely, nowhere to be found, lost.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.870
Even in lost and found he won’t be there.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.990
But it’s that ego of yours that has resistance

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.000
for the superego

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:27.920
and that’s how you manage it.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.810
You see that’s why people can drink,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.040
it has nothing to do with the cold weather or anything

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.880
it’s more your ego.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.940
Now when you call also left sided

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.820
sometimes you make a big mistake.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.920
You are not.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.960
You live with that myth

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.890
because that’s how you can excuse your ego.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.950
Because basically Western people are egotistical.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.810
We must accept this fact.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.980
We are not Western people, we belong to the realm of God,

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.880
so don’t feel guilty.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.920
You are no more Western, to Me you are neither Indian,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.030
nor English nor Australians, you are My children.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.980
But some of these things are hanging around,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.010
so you be careful what I am telling you,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.850
this will happen to all of you in a little way but not much.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.890
So be careful, it is outside,

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.980
outside the mariadas where you little bit get out, you find.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.970
So those who think also who are left-sided,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.900
are only possessed people, because they’re possessed,

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.920
that’s why they become left-sided,

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.010
otherwise they’re not, by temperament they’re not,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.910
because there’s no tradition,

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.990
there’s no conditioning accepted, nothing,

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.960
there has been no conditioning on them of any kind.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.890
So there are hardly to be found any tamasikas in the West,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.960
hardly to be found.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.910
So what do we have are the people

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.900
who are egotistical but get possessed.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.890
So these possessions take charge of your ego,

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.010
and they work through your ego,

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.840
so they are much more dangerous than the ordinary tamasikas.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.990
You see an ordinary tamasikas who even gets possessed,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.840
he dies very soon; otherwise he just, he troubles himself.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.890
He gets body pains, he gets all those troubles himself.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.020
But when a person who is egoistical is also possessed,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.900
then he becomes a troublesome person.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.820
In India if people drink you’ll be surprised

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.980
they become very nice people, extremely mild,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.830
very quiet, very good.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.830
I mean some women told Me,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.900
“We want them to drink because they’re better.”

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.800
But not here, they become violent, why?

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.980
Because there is already the base for the ego

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.960
and these fellows who jump in from the left side

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.930
or right side whatever it is take over the ego.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.960
And they work through the ego then,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:12.020
so such people become cruel, assertive.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.990
I mean, all Germans were dealt like that.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.960
They were all possessed by supraconscious bhoots

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.810
and they all behaved in this atrocious manner.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.870
Imagine any human being, human being,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.920
killing millions of people with the gas chamber.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.960
Can you think of it?

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.010
I mean, you can’t even see

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.000
a little chicken being cut in your presence.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.880
How can you see so many people just there,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.800
being gassed before you,

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.820
trying to get out of the gas chambers?

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.840
And they were all transparent so you could see them.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.820
See the cruelty to which they could go. How?

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:56.980
They were possessed, and possessed by egoistical temperament.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.020
So these bhoots also used their ego and did it.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.990
So we are in the center,

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.970
we are the people who have ascended to God’s level;

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.970
we have no business to have Left Vishuddhi on any point.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.940
We have no ego. Where is the ego? It’s finished.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.900
Where is the superego? Finished.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.920
So if there is even a lurking thing of that,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.960
you just face up to it. Why do you feel guilty?

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.930
For what?

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.900
Nonsense?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.940
And that’s how you get rid of it.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.000
Because I have seen with Sahaja Yogis also

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.890
suddenly their nose will blow out, their eyes will come out,

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.810
suddenly they’ll talk like this and I get a fright.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.960
I said, “What’s the matter? He was a normal person,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.850
why is he talking like this now?”

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.940
The reason is that hidden ego suddenly jumps out and shows.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.820
It’s with many Indians also,

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.890
those who are city dwellers are horribly egoistical,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.810
you have blessed them, as I told you,

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.980
so they also behave in the same manner.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.920
But because there is tradition of keeping in the center

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.830
in any country, like China has the same.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.870
I’ve seen, China has the same.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.890
I haven’t seen they ever say,

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.900
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.030
And they don’t even discuss.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.870
The Russians have been so bad to them.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.960
“It’s all right,” we tell them. We ask them,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.800
“Why did you cut off from the Russians?” “Forget it.”

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.800
They never criticize, sit down and criticize,

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.910
“They did like this,” or sulk about it or think about, nothing.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.040
Like Indians, now you will be surprised,

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.870
we have a law that we are not supposed

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.010
to make any films against the English. Can you imagine?

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.920
Because they left our country in grace.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.850
Even Shivaji’s pictures are not allowed

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.870
because maybe it will show that the Muslims are bad,

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.860
to that extent we go.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.920
Because forget it, forget it, forget it,

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.990
when you start thinking about that person,

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.870
your ego gets hit.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.890
It is an ego which is hurt,

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.870
now you can blow this

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.980
balloon by two methods, perhaps you know that,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.980
by blowing into it or removing all the air from outside,

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.870
or even by hitting.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.960
So the hurt ego is where the outside

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.010
is getting vacated and the balloon is increasing,

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.010
and the other ego, pumped up ego,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.840
is that when the balloon is filled with that air.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.990
Both things are just the same;

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:57.040
I mean the result is the same

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.880
whether you do it this way or that way.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.960
So once you understand the physical manifestation of this,

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.020
not only that you develop all these diseases but also

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.940
develop a thing called lunacy at a very, very young age,

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.930
because you don’t know how to cope with yourself.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.960
So the best way is to, if you have done something,

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.840
forgive yourself at that point,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.860
“I forgive myself at this point, all right.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.900
And that this was done because of this - all right,

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.850
so I should not have done this.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.990
Never I’m not going to do it again,”

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.000
Just say like that, just absolutely neutralize.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.970
Unless and until you neutralize it,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.950
you again store it up there, that’s the point is.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:47.030
Secondly I have to tell you that the women in the West

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.910
have changed their styles, which is very, very dangerous

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.980
for their society, because they have also taken

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.840
to the egoistical ways of men.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.950
So if men have gone say ten feet

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.970
they have run after them again,

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.000
about say eight feet and pulled back men

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.010
even to go further than them.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.800
Now this is completely crossing your egos,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:21.830
because women do not have such possibility of egos normally.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.810
So competing men in ego what you did

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.880
you have lost your complete mariadas of a woman,

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.930
there’s no mariada of a woman.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.030
Man has a mariada of a man;

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.980
if a man starts behaving like a woman, he’s not a man.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.990
In the same way, the women, if they start behaving like men,

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.010
then they are no more women. They lost their mariadas.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.040
They’re out, so they get possessed.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.800
And that’s why women, when they are egoistical

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.860
they become horrid,

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.020
their faces become horrid, they look horrid,

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.030
their whole behavior is horrid.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.910
They can become dry like bean sticks you see,

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.800
and could be so hard as to hit you like an iron rod.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.890
They say, “The lady with the iron rod in her hand.”

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.800
All this happens because we have a mariada,

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.840
we are the style as we are.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.010
If it’s a rose, it’s a rose.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.850
Be happy that you are a flower of rose.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.900
Now the rose wants to become the thorn,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.840
so we lose all our mariadas.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.890
Today I will be speaking to you before we start this

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.010
here when the people are coming before that,

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.020
to the ladies and tell them what’s gone wrong with them,

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.810
and that is how you must know that the plight

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.950
of the West is not by men, but by women.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:58.830
Women have ruined the society of West, Western society.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.840
Is the Indian women who have kept the society intact.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:07.930
All My really thanks to their solid behavior towards life.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.880
It is the women of this country

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.900
who have ruined all that was so delicate,

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.920
emotional, beautiful, love, affection, compassion.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.870
Women are there to give joy

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:28.810
and happiness and emotional security to the whole society.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.970
While they take over, “Do this, give that, do that.”

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.800
Even the husbands have become just like servants in the house.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.810
“You haven’t done the cleaning properly,

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.960
you haven’t cleaned the kitchen properly.”

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.940
I went to England, I was surprised all kitchen

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.000
cleaning and all that is so well done in England,

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.880
you see you have everything for cleaning this,

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.820
cleaning that. I said, “Why it has happened?”

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.820
It’s the men, you see, they had to do it

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.840
so they found out all the ways and methods.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.920
Have to be sparkling all right, sparkling you want,

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.820
I’ll get you such a thing that

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.870
if you put in your hand your hand will burn,

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.850
all the acids put everywhere,

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.980
with a big glove in the hand put it everywhere.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.800
And everything gets all right.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.940
Then the children, you see, suffer,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.900
because that’s the job of a gardener,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.870
beautiful things that are born,

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.860
to be looked after with that kindness.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.020
But you over-indulge into your children in the beginning.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:38.900
A mother is like a gardener, she has to prune also;

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.890
she has to cut also,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.810
so the growth is all right.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:44.880
If you child is spoilt

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.020
you’re no good a mother, useless you are.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.030
But you groom your husband not your children,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:56.890
just the other way round,

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.950
because ego is towards your husband all the time grooming.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.030
“Sit here, go there, what’s this?”

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.800
Money business, “Give me all the money,

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.880
I keep all the money,” everything.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.940
Now one may say that the law is such.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.920
If the law is stupid, the Sahaja Yoginis

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.950
should not take to such a law.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.840
That law has ruined you all, I tell you.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.840
Because this is such an important part of life,

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.040
it is such an important area of life

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.880
that it should not have suffered.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.920
Where affection, love, kindness,

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.880
all that is required is missing,

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.800
then you become people without any meaning.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.920
Life is aimless. You don’t know what to do,

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.940
that’s why the children commit suicide.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.010
And then the love should be such that they should be pruned,

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.920
for that you must have wisdom,

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.840
which also one does not develop,

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.810
because if you run after your Mooladhara Chakra

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.920
how can you have wisdom?

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.880
Here men have befooled you completely.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.040
Completely they have befooled you, take it from Me.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.990
You must keep your wisdom intact.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.960
And not only that they have befooled you,

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.850
but they themselves have stooped down to befool you.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.910
So they have their devious methods,

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.040
they are not straightforward.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.800
So, as Sahaja Yogis we are above all these things,

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.020
we have reached the state where we are above.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.010
We are here for correcting

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.960
all those things that have gone wrong in the society,

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.040
because Sahaja Yoga faces towards the society,

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.840
not towards yourself only.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.810
So at this stage we have to understand

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:45.890
what we have to do is:

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.040
first of all our own understanding should be such.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.970
Even now with all this movement of Sahaja Yoga understanding,

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.040
women don’t realize that they have to be like women.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:02.800
I have seen them, they still, “What’s wrong?” Still go on,

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:08.020
and men don’t understand that they have to be like men,

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.940
even after so many (things/years?).

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.910
And if they they become really like men,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.990
women will appreciate them.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.990
And if you become really like women,

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.950
men will appreciate you.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.820
You see, it’s the opposites that attract each other,

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.860
that should be normal.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.890
But we live in abnormal way

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.820
that the men are women and the women are men.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.030
What do you do now?

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.970
So it is very important

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.000
for men to understand now

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.860
- because I am going to talk to women later on

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.860
- that they should become like men.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.990
They must fix up things, they must take decisions,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.870
they must be the one who must rule.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.940
But that’s outward, actually it’s the source is the woman,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.950
the woman is the potential and man is the kinetic.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.930
For example, there’s a fan moving.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:15.800
Movement of the fan is the kinetic force you can say,

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.040
but the potential force that is within us

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.880
is the one which is the electricity,

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:23.980
which is coming from the source.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.940
Which is higher, the fan that moves or the source?

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.010
Let the women decide and men understand.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.860
But if that source dries out and wants to become the fan,

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.870
no fan will work.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.930
Upside down situation.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.010
If you realize you are the source,

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.950
you are the one who is going to give all the shakti to men,

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.990
you will stop behaving like men.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.970
It doesn’t mean that you cannot go to work, you cannot do;

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.860
but take to work which is more suitable to women.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.810
Like I would not like a woman to have a bus driver’s job

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.890
or a truck driver, or wrestler.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:15.000
No. I’m not telling you; I’m telling from experience.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.900
Once I was traveling,

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.910
I was a student at that time, in Lahore, you see,

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.800
and I was traveling by train and at some station,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.830
you see, the train stopped in the night

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.020
and a lady came and she said, “Open the door for me.”

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.880
So I said, “But it’s so crowded, all right I’ll try, I’ll try.”

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.940
And she said. “If You don’t open I can break it.”

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.960
I said, “How can you?”

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.890
She said, “You don’t know who I am?” I said, “Who?”

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.830
She said, “I am Ahmida Bhanu.”

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.990
I said, ‘Who’s Ahmida Bhanu?” “The wrestler lady.”

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.960
“Oh, baba,” I said, “Thank God.”

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.860
I said, “If you’re a wrestler lady

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.870
why are you coming in the ladies department,

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.010
why don’t you go to the men’s?”

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.980
And she pushed the door so violently,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.860
she came up and I looked at her, you know I said,

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.980
“Wow, what a person!”

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:14.800
And she sat down, you see, with her whole countenance

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.000
and everything, her gait and state of sitting,

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.840
everything was so manly.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.900
Like that she sat down and said,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.890
“Come along now those who want to say I should not sit here.”

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:26.910
I said, “Nobody wants that now, Madam, you sit comfortably.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.880
But we’ll have to get somebody

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.910
from the other compartment to have wrestling.”

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:36.000
And then she was quiet, and she was really,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.880
I saw her all her muscles so overdeveloped

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.820
and she was really looking like

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.840
I would say a Western cow, we can say.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:57.880
Like the cows here look like buffalos, not like cows.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.880
Something very funny I cannot forget that,

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.880
you see that experience, I was very young and I was really,

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.830
I didn’t know, and I felt like laughing but I couldn’t even

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.930
laugh at her, she’ll box my (face?).

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.930
So this is what it is, that we are ending up there,

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.010
must know that, how far are we going.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.960
Are we going to become wrestlers?

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.980
So this is what it is,

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.890
one has to learn that it has been there for ages,

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.810
ages it has been there.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.800
I have seen, I’ve read books, some books, old books;

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:38.930
I’ve seen some films also,

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.810
where they’ve shown even in olden times,

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.800
the women used to have broom in their hands

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.990
hitting their husband sort of thing.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.910
We, too, have some of them blessed in India

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:51.950
but they’re very, very few, very few women like that.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.890
Not a big number but it may increase, God knows, you see,

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.820
so keep your fingers crossed,

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:01.930
but I would say that this is what is happening.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.830
So with too much ego of men which goes into Left Vishuddhi

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.910
they say, “No, let the women take over, it’s all right,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.990
let them be satisfied. No more of their aggression,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.920
let them have their own.”

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:14.860
So they do what they like,

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.920
men are not bothered and they go into their left this thing,

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.870
and there’s no enjoyment of marriage or love.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.980
So now we had yesterday the other marriage

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.950
for the benefit of your children, for the goodness of them,

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.890
all that, take your roles as women and men.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.000
Your roles are as women and men

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.830
and you’ll see you’ll enjoy it.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.850
The quarrel should be on that role.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.950
The man wants to do something for you, you should say,

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.860
“No, no, no how can you do? That’s too much for me.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.020
Let me do this work.”

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.010
As I’ve told you many a times

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.020
how My husband when he gets angry

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.910
he wants to wash his undershirt, you see to show he’s angry.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:59.980
Or when he’s very angry, then he will clean the bathroom.

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.930
But he does it so badly

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.040
that I know that it is he has done.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.990
I feel like laughing but I dare not

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.810
because I must keep his spirit on.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.930
And then he starts talking in a very you see,

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.880
respectable way to everyone.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.820
“Thou,” he calls everyone ‘thou,’ you see.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.990
“Thou,” he says, “Thou are like that, thou are like that,”

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.040
so I know now he is really angry for something.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.910
But he won’t say what he is angry with, you see.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.880
Then we have to find out what is he angry with,

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.950
and if so, don’t feel guilty, correct it.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.870
And then he fights - you see there are so many ways

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.020
of neutralizing the anger.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.830
The first thing that happens with ego is the anger.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:55.880
As yesterday you got married,

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.010
you must know how to neutralize this

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.820
because still ego is there.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.980
Now to find out how to neutralize

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.970
the anger of another person is a very beautiful thing

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.820
which I’ve never seen your writers handling,

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.860
but in India we have many writers

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.940
who have handled the situation.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.930
Now you must find out

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.890
what are the weak points of your husband, first of all,

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.040
and of your wife.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:22.820
On what point she get upset.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.920
Now the attitude should be we should not upset her,

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.030
we should not make her angry,

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.940
and another attitude of the wife the same way,

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.940
much more for the husband.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.820
So now, what are the soft points

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.930
on which  he really gets upset? Just study, it’s very simple,

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.000
laugh at it, don’t take it seriously

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:41.960
but be careful to avoid that.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.870
Now also find out what makes him happy.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.890
Like if I’m really sometimes - I never get angry,

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.910
as you know that, I never get angry,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.890
but if I am showing off My anger just …

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.820
So, now how to show that,

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.980
how to neutralize an anger of a person?

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.840
Say now, supposing I am trying to show,

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.870
if you put a child in My lap - finished, anger is gone.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.040
I cannot show anger with a child on My lap, is simple.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.950
So you must find out.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:25.950
Like My husband, you see, if he’s angry supposing,

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.920
I know him then if I tell him that

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.850
“What about getting Me a nice sari.”

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.940
Ah, finished, then he’s very happy.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.860
Ah, I’ve done him the greatest favor, you see.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.970
Like that, you see, you must find out

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.990
what thing pleases your husband,

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:46.910
what thing pleases your wife, and neutralize it.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.810
And, you see, little things like that you must learn.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:50.980
This is the art of living,

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.940
this is the art of living a Sahaja Yogi life.

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:55.840
Is the art of living it,

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.030
how with little few things you see how I manage.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.880
Now you must have seen how in My lecture

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.920
I say quite serious things, but in your bubbles of laughter

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.990
it just settles down in your mind,

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.880
that’s how you should do it.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.950
Because humor is one of the greatest things

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.950
that puts the thing through, makes the person understand,

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.820
and it doesn’t harm anyone.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.040
That’s how things improve,

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.000
and when you see that you are settled down in peace,

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.840
that’s the first thing a husband and wife must do

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.920
is to settle down in peace.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.940
Children feel all right, everyone feels all right

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.840
and then gradually let it correct.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.860
You have no responsibility of correcting each other;

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.000
but if you have married somebody who is not a Sahaja Yogini,

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.840
who is horrid and all that,

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:42.940
then the question is very different.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.800
But both are Sahaja Yogis married before Me,

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.860
should be the easiest thing to do.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.870
And protect each other; look after each other.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.960
There should be complete confidence.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:58.910
And this is - we have in our country, really I must say

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.900
our marriage system has something special about it.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.830
What happened, once I went to Singapore you’ll be surprised,

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.980
the early times, I was going to America,

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.830
and there was one horrible diplomat’s wife,

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.910
she came drunk to the program

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.860
and she was asked to get out because she was drunk.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.000
So she informed our Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.960
that “This lady is doing this kind of work

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.980
and She should not do this, She’s a diplomat’s wife

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.950
and She’s so highly placed” and this and that.”

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.830
So Indira Gandhi without understanding anything

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:27.930
told one fellow who was Haksar,

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.890
who was her main person that

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.040
“You go and tell Mr. Srivastava

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.880
that this should not be done and She should be brought back.”

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.820
So the minister, you see,

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.800
getting a message for Indira Gandhi

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.800
means the deathblow has come to the minister that time.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.800
So he sent for My husband.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:46.830
And he called him and he said that

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.000
“We think you wife should be called back

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.830
and this is what has happened.”

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.890
And he said, “Why? Why do you want to call Her?

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.830
She doesn’t drink, She doesn’t smoke,

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.940
She doesn’t do anything wrong. She’s the most decent woman,

00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.820
She’s very dignified and She knows what She’s doing.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.020
She’s doing good work for no money at all.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.850
She’s doing nothing wrong and if you want I’ll resign

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:06.980
but I’ll not call Her.”

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.010
And he got a fright of his life,

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.960
because if he resigns who’s going to do the job?

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.010
So capable. Just said, “I’ll resign.”

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.970
And they were all shocked at it you see,

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.800
the way he was confident.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.940
And this I came to know through somebody else,

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.970
told himself the minister who was dead,

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.000
half dead with the message from the Prime Minister, you see.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.800
And he then sent back, he also got to see within himself,

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.800
he said, “I know the lady very well, She’s very dignified,

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.940
She’s a very decent lady, She’s very dharmic

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.000
we shouldn’t disturb Her.”

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.930
While the fellow Haksar who had sent the message

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.030
also got a shock, you see,

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.860
and pushed back the shock to Indira Gandhi.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.970
Since that she has never,

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.830
never tried to interfere with My work.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.890
You’ll be surprised, she’s never tried to interfere.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.810
This is my husband’s confidence in My work and understanding.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.890
That you should have.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.940
You must know your wife and know your husband,

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.040
they cannot do such and such thing.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.030
About, same about your children.

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.020
You must have full confidence in them.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.960
You must know what they are, what they are up to,

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.910
how far they can go.

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:18.000
And then this confidence, an inner understanding

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.990
is the one road to peace, love and affection.

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:24.010
Complete confidence into each other,

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:25.830
wherever they may be.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.960
I can say with confidence you send my daughters anywhere

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.850
they will never take to adharmic life,

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:33.860
nor my son-in-laws, but my own daughters I can tell you.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.960
They can never think of adharmic life,

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.030
whatever you may try.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.900
It should be that confidence within you

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:44.980
about your own children.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.990
Like they were small, very small and the neighbors came

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.860
and said that “Your daughters came and were using this,

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.960
our garden, for morning ablution.”

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.970
I said. “What?” Said, “My children,

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.810
even if they can go into your bathroom, you take them.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.880
I give you two thousand rupees just now, right now.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:09.880
You just ask them to go to your bathroom,

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.880
that’s all.”

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.880
I know them too well.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.810
If somebody will say, “Your daughter has taken something,”

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.950
I know them too well, they can never touch anybody’s things,

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.040
I know them too well.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.990
They’ll never take any obligation from anyone like that,

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.030
I know them too well.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.900
So that’s what you should know your children too well.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.020
Don’t insult them in the presence of others.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.040
Build up their character and majesty by saying,

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.860
“Come along, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.910
you are great, you’ll be this, that,”

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.860
and put them on that path,

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.930
keep them there, respect them.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.900
But don’t spoil them. Don’t spoil them.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.810
We normally spoil.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.940
Either we’re over-indulgent or you make them over-indulgent,

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:00.870
both things are wrong, is again ego.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.900
Tell them how to share things, tell them how to share.

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.960
And like if they share,

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.960
they give it to somebody else you should be happy,

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.010
it’s given to others. “Give this to others,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.920
let the others play.”

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.880
You see, you show your happiness on that,

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.990
you yourself give to others,

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:18.950
then the children learn all these things.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.920
So marriage is a very big bondage for Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.030
Through marriages we are all bound together.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.850
It’s all a society of very happily married people.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.030
Now if somebody is not capable of having a good marriage,

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.850
better forget about it, forget it.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.900
See, after all I have seen women of sixty, of My age,

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:41.820
asking for a marriage.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.840
Yes, there are women and men and they’re sixty years,

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.820
“Mother, I’m only sixty and I would like to get married.”

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:50.860
I said, “ What?” At sixty I have thousands of children,

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.870
how can you say of such a thing?

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.010
I mean, you should not be a bride all your life.

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.910
You should be a mother and a grandmother.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:59.910
I think after forty-five

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:03.940
nobody should think of marriage, is nonsense.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.880
It’s nonsense after forty-five, all the,

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.800
even the married women should know they are mothers

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:11.970
and they are going to be grandmothers,

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.890
they’re all the time brides.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.910
You see that’s why, that’s one of the reasons

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:19.860
why marriages fail.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.890
Because you are not a bride after say,

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.870
thirty years of age or thirty-five years of age,

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.960
you are a mother, absolute mother you are.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.010
And you are a father, and that’s how you live as father

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:29.030
and mother of the children.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:31.040
We are called like that in our country.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:32.980
Till the age of thirty, thirty years,

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.030
we are called as the brides like doolai

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:36.860
but once you are grown up

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.980
- I’m never called as My name by anyone.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.960
They say “Kalpana’s Mother” or “Sadhana’s Mother.”

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.010
Or even My husband is called as Kalpana’s father,

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.870
is never called by his name,

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.860
because you become a father and a mother,

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:50.930
accept that position.

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.950
But no, you want to be brides at that age,

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:57.830
so you want to have all the bed like a bride has,

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.810
all the bedroom thing like a bride has,

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:03.030
and the bedroom thing and it doesn’t work out.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.990
Because you are no more a bride,

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.930
and then you think, “Oh, this man has become insipid,”

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.030
“This woman has become insipid,”

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:12.970
then you go to another woman, another man, goes on.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.910
Then you go to children

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:16.980
and spoil the innocence of the people.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.020
But if you accept, grow properly, mature like Sahaja Yogis,

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:25.840
as father and mother, as dignified people.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.860
It’s not the source of love only as husbands’

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.810
or wives’ relationship,

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:35.820
there are so many relationships, which are a greater source,

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.820
but depends on at what point you are.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.890
When you are a small little river, all right;

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:45.930
but now you have become the ocean, so become the ocean.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.920
When you become the sea, become the sea.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.800
When you become the ocean, you become the ocean.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.840
A sea cannot remain like a little,

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.040
little small little beginning, can it?

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.990
In the same way everyone must know that

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.830
they must grow out from this relationship

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.980
and should not go on hankering all the time

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:06.940
that husband and wife.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.910
Like forty-five years of age

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.880
they are still finding out their husbands, are they mad?

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:17.820
This should stop in our Sahaja Yoga now,

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:20.880
all those who have gone beyond a certain age

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.040
should stop bothering Me about marriages,

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:24.860
should become mothers,

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:26.000
there are so many children to be looked after,

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.800
we are going to have nurseries, better be there.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.800
What is it, what is the companionship?

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:33.830
The companionship is with children, with the grandchildren,

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.820
with great-grandchildren.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.020
This is what one has to understand, men and women both.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:44.870
Men are just the same.

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.860
Men also try never become fathers.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.010
If you are full-fledged fathers,

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.010
you don’t have these ideas of marriage, forget it.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.970
If it doesn’t work out with one woman, forget it.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.980
Then forget it. No need, you’ve had enough of it.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.820
So this kind of thing is not necessary at all,

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.010
and it has worked in a society

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.940
which is not a Sahaja Yogi society,

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.910
so it should work in you.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.990
So social ways Indians are quite good,

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.880
but they’re bad in economics and politics.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.940
Never follow their politics, horrid.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:23.910
Horrid.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.930
I mean, I can’t think of a worse politics

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.880
that Indian politics, is the worst of all.

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:31.900
If you listen to that,

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.850
you will not know whether to cry or laugh,

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:37.020
is such idiots you know, all donkeys have gone into politics,

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.900
absolutely donkeys. Worse than that.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:42.010
They bray like donkeys, they behave like donkeys,

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.850
they kick each other,

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:47.020
they do all kind of things can you imagine,

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:48.860
it’s so horrifying.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.030
I mean if you want to have a joke

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.870
then you can look at it from a joke point of view,

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.890
of the donkeys, you see, behaving like,

00:51:56.970 --> 00:52:00.980
absolutely as if they are in charge of our great country.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:02.990
So most of them are donkeys,

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.040
I’ve not come across many who are sensible.

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.010
And those who are sensible also want to become donkeys.

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.030
What to do? That is their greatest desire is to

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.880
- imagine a saint wants to become a donkey!

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:21.860
So let us know that whatever are our good points

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.860
are our good points that we should not lose.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.000
Whatever are our bad points we should correct them.

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:29.970
This is a very balanced view towards oneself.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.860
Because we are the gain,

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:34.800
nobody else is going to gain and Sahaja Yogis

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.970
have to be selfish about it. We are the gainers;

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.920
if we gain, the whole body gains,

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:41.850
whole of Sahaja Yoga gains.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.890
So this is what I am telling you about your social life

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.880
which is very important, and about your ego.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:49.960
But the most important thing is that

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:55.840
once you are in the Sahasara you become My brain,

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.880
you become really My brain.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.980
And so you have to be very careful

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:05.960
because you’re not thinking about your family,

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.820
your children, your household.

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.990
Not thinking about Melbourne ashram

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.910
or Sydney ashram or Australia,

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.900
but you’re thinking about the whole world

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.930
and the whole Universe, and the betterment of it.

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.870
When you grow to that state

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.850
you become really part and parcel of My brain,

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:30.970
which is concerned with very bigger visions, higher things.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.840
It works on lower levels also,

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:35.010
that’s something good about it,

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.010
but it can work on your individual levels.

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.020
I pay attention to your individual problems,

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.860
to your individual suggestions, to anything that you say,

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.850
but the light is for the whole Universe.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:52.940
So we enter into the realm of universal religion,

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.880
which we have to awaken, which we have to work out.

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:57.980
Unless and until you achieve that state,

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.000
you will not be called full-fledged Sahaja Yogis.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.920
So, to achieve that you must work hard,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.990
or we can call now you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.000
you’ll become maha yogis.

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.920
So, we have to achieve that state of maha yoga.

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:15.020
From this to that is very simple, (it) works out.

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.820
Imagine four years back I never thought

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:23.020
that I will be able to establish so many of you

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:26.040
here as My children, and it has happened today.

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.890
It’s such a great thing that in four years

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.910
we have been able to achieve such beautiful results

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:35.860
and next year will be greater still,

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.950
I can see from the way people were there.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:43.040
So, one has to understand in Sahaja Yoga obedience

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.020
to what Mother says is all right.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.010
But some people have a bad habit of taking up over,

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:50.990
“for Mother’s sake do it, for Mother.” Who is the person?

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:53.940
Why should anybody say that do it for Mothers sake?

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.950
Or Mother says so.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.880
No, when you are the Spirit you understand what Mother says,

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.900
so try to understand your Spirit.

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:03.930
That’s the best way you can work it out

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.030
and you can be nice.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.920
I want all our children to grow from that height,

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.940
let them start with a better standards,

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.900
from a better levels, because we started from a lower levels,

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:18.010
we had problems, but let our children start

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.990
from a higher level and Melbourne is the place I’ve chosen

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:22.890
for our children to grow.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.010
So I hope women will take their roles,

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.880
men will take their roles

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:29.890
and it will be a nice family system built here,

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.960
a nice society and this nice society.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.830
What’s it? Put if off.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.830
I know.

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:56.990
I know the lights very well.

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.030
I know how they act.

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.960
Vishnumaya, that’s Vishnumaya,

00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:05.820
we have harnessed the Vishnumaya.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.990
From where did we get light, Vishnumaya, hidden where?

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:13.840
The Vishnumaya, you see, is the One what we need today,

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:15.950
and to understand it in a subtle way

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.950
how the Vishnumaya comes.

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.920
See now how sahaj, this thing came there

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:22.000
I could speak on Vishnumaya,

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.960
because to shift the subject on Vishnumaya is not easy.

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.950
See, you must see the play, you must see the play.

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:34.890
Now this Vishmumaya, how does it come?

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.870
How it acts through Me so well?

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.920
How, what happens, from where does it come?

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:43.950
Hydroelectric, how hydroelectric was, in water,

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:45.870
it is in water in the Guru Tattwa,

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.040
but when, when it comes down,

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.940
when the Guru Tattwa has come down to you.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:58.820
On that level the Vishnumaya acts,

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.040
that liberates and acts.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.960
For what? For enlightening.

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.950
What happens in the gross happens in the subtle.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.870
So One has to take an incarnation,

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.930
so the Guru principle has to take an incarnation

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.930
to come down to this earth.

00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:26.810
So Vishnumaya acts and enlightens people

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.000
and this is what it is, and how the whole thing works out.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:36.820
Now you have seen how I could change the topic

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:40.810
suddenly to that, and you didn’t feel it.

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:43.970
But I just wanted you to see how Mother changes the topics,

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:47.890
because there are some incidents something happens

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.930
somewhere, which I know, and it changes.

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:55.850
And it looks like a smooth one subject going on.

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:59.810
Another thing I have to tell you

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.010
that all of you must know Sahaja Yoga full well.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.820
Very few people really know about Kundalini,

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:05.980
really know about vibrations.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:07.880
They do not know where is the Void.

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:08.950
There should be a regular class,

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.000
even for grown up Sahaja Yogis.

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:13.840
Where is the Void on the feet,

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.000
where are the chakras on the feet?

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.980
When I tell them to rub My Feet, they don’t know where it is.

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.920
You may be uneducated, doesn’t matter,

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:25.800
but in Sahaja Yoga you should be educated.

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:27.850
You should have a full education in Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:32.930
You must know where is this disease coming from,

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:36.850
how to cure it. Every one of you should be educated here.

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.870
So when you have your meditation class,

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.800
also you must have a class to educate yourself

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:44.040
about Sahaja Yoga,

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:46.900
what are the things to be done.

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.040
Now there’s a book, of course I saw that’s a good book

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:51.880
they have written about children, but there’s no spontaneity,

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.990
so I’ll have to work it out.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:57.910
But it’s not only the books but My tapes are there.

00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:59.890
When you are listening to My tapes,

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:02.880
note down the points what Mother has said,

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.950
and see for yourself.

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:06.900
So the education in Sahaja Yoga is very important,

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.860
otherwise your intelligence will rust out.

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.000
You must have full education of Sahaja Yoga,

00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.040
only giving Realization is not the work.

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.940
You must have, so others must know you are knowledgeable.

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:21.870
The amount of education you have had nobody had before,

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.910
no saint had it.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.930
So now take full advantage.

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.000
Whatever your age may be, education qualification maybe,

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:31.890
what doesn’t matter but you should all know

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.820
what is Sahaja Yoga, what it means, how it works out.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:38.840
Ask questions yourself and find answers.

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.880
You all are still students of Sahaja Yoga - must know that,

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:45.910
you are still students of Sahaja Yoga and you must master it,

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.960
you must know it, every word of it.

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:49.990
Just to enjoy Sahaja Yoga is not the point,

00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:51.840
you must also know.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.970
Like, if you enjoy a cake cooked by somebody,

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.890
you must know how it is cooked,

00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:59.840
because then you can cook for others.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:01.810
But if you don’t know how to cook

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.040
people are not going to believe. This is what I’ve seen.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.820
Then I’ve seen some Sahaja Yogis

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:08.860
are all the time doing the work,

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.920
they’re active because they’ve been active before,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.030
but some are lethargic.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.940
You can see even among two Indian people

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.830
you’ll find the same difference,

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.930
though they are here or they may be there, it should not be.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:24.920
Everybody should try to create the same kind

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.990
of an enthusiasm and dynamism, not one person.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.910
If one person does it, then it’s no use.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.020
Sometimes such a one person can be very dominating also.

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.850
Everybody should work, the whole body has to work,

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:37.960
if we can develop that,

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:44.000
that will help the complete development, upliftment.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.800
All right?

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.010
So today on this day of My Birthday,

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.020
I want to bless you very much,

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:57.910
but every birthday is reducing My age you must know that,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.920
and so you must grow up now to take over, is important.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.010
Is very important that you must grow up,

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.890
so-called age of Mine,

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.010
though it doesn’t show but it is decreasing,

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.020
you must know that, and so you have to now

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.850
fasten your movements, get to it, work it out.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.830
When others come, talk to them nicely, give them joy,

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:19.040
don’t give them any - give them joy.

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:20.930
Look after them, be kind to them,

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.870
that is going to be attractive than to,

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.970
immediately somebody says, “You are a bhoot you get out.”

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.800
When they are in Sahaja Yoga, when they are there,

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:28.850
I will tell them off.

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:30.970
There are still, I know some of them still here,

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.850
we have to tell them that,

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.840
“You have a problem, you better get out.”

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.910
It’s all right, they’ll have to get out of the ashrams

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.900
for a while then come back.

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:41.870
It has to be like that, otherwise they cannot be corrected

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.950
and such people must accept gladly that

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:45.930
they should be all right, they must change;

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.870
they must be better than to continue

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:51.010
with whatever they have because of their ego.

01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:54.800
So try to co-operate with your self

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.910
because it wants to be better, and better and better.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.800
So all those people whom I’ll be asking,

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.800
I’ll tell Warren, whom those people whom I find

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:04.810
are not all right should get out of ashram.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.000
Ashram is not a place where all kinds of people should stay.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.040
Here only the pure up to a point they should be.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.910
There should be certain minimum standard they must have.

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:15.930
If they do not have that standard, they get out.

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:18.800
Even if there’s a woman who is dominating,

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:21.870
or a man who is like a woman, has to get out.

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:23.040
You have to be normal people,

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.870
otherwise others who come and they see

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:30.970
one man standing like a chicken cut from here, you see.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:34.900
They just don’t feel impressed.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:51.020
I tell you, like a miserable Christ you see as I showed you,

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.930
standing there limply like that.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.970
I don’t know who feels impressed by that.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.950
You must have somebody like you have Christ

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:02.040
in the Sistine Chapel, you see, standing

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.950
like a stalwart that’s how the men should be,

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.800
but dignified, respectable, kindly,

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:14.800
majestic is all right.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.020
And the women should be very sweet and nice.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.860
It pays a very, very long and a great dividend.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.970
Very, very, long,

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:28.870
you don’t know how much it has paid Me.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.990
It is coming so handy today to Me.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.970
You see when I was not doing Sahaja Yoga

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.990
by My nature I’ve been kind to people,

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.980
and all that has come.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.850
One example I’ll give you, in London one fellow came,

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.820
his name is …that commissioner’s name is what?

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.040
Commissioner of Pune, he’s now commissioner of Pune,

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:53.830
all right.

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:57.980
He came to see us, we had a meeting of My husband’s office

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:00.850
or something. CP said, “I’ll call them for dinner.”

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.860
I said, “All right.” I had cooked the dinner at home;

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:05.030
there were about twenty-five people who came to dinner.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.870
They had dinner I must have looked after them,

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.000
whatever it is.

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.830
So when I went to Pune, Mehrotra,

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.810
told Me that this Commissioner is very anxious

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:15.950
that he should come as the President or the Chairman

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.970
or the reception committee, must receive Me.

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:21.830
I said, “I don’t remember who is this gentleman.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.010
I remember somebody with the same name.”

01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:25.010
He said, “No, no, no, no this is another one.”

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.850
Now this is one of them who had come

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.020
and he praised Me so much, I was amazed how he saw all that.

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:36.800
He said, “This lady whose husband is so highly placed

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:40.000
in life, is so humble, She’s so kind, so motherly.”

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.830
And he went home and told his wife,

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:43.980
“That I’ve never seen such a lady before,

01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:46.020
such a perfect Lady.”

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.930
That’s what I did I don’t know.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.860
I must have cooked well, of course that I do,

01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:58.960
but I must have looked after him well,

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:01.900
I must have been kind to him, to all of them.

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.830
I must have not eaten anything Myself,

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.000
looked after, must have done something,

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:08.020
I don’t remember what I did.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.820
But by My own nature I have to do,

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.960
and it is not today but I’ve seen so many of them

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.900
come so handy, only because of this nature of Mine,

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.840
only because of this nature of Mine.

01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:23.810
You know our High Commissioner in UK,

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.830
both the High Commissioners the first one and the second one,

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:27.970
B.K.Nehru, and the second one,

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.800
they had such tremendous respect for Me, regard for Me,

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:34.820
can’t imagine,

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:38.930
because you have to be kind and considerate and nice.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:42.820
As you look after Me here, I looked after them.

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:45.890
And that’s how they have such impressions,

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:48.030
I tell you all my husband’s friends and everybody

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.920
have such regard and respect.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.830
We went to see somebody who is head of the law,

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:57.860
is the head of the Intelligence in India;

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.910
he gave us a right royal treatment.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.990
The Collector of Customs was informed that

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.870
Mother’s children are coming,

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:10.040
he himself came to the airport, do you know that?

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.860
He was sitting there I don’t know if he came out

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:14.970
to see that you were all out.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.870
It is only My personal life with them

01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:19.910
otherwise who cares for whose wife?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.840
So many came after My husband,

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.880
nobody’s bothered about their wives.

01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:26.920
Anywhere, you see I came this time

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.950
with My husband to go to China

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.990
and his agents who were in Japan and other places,

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:37.800
Honolulu, they all came just to meet Me,

01:06:37.890 --> 01:06:39.040
because he comes nobody comes to see him.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:43.810
He said, “Now You have come, they’ve come to see.”

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.860
Can you believe it?

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:50.860
It’s nothing but just being a lady to them.

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:52.020
It’s such a powerful thing.

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:55.880
It’s such a powerful thing and women must know how to cook,

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.900
that’s important.

01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:58.810
If they don’t know how to cook they’re not women,

01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.900
I don’t think they’re women.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:02.820
They all must know how to cook.

01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:05.990
You must learn how to cook and everybody can learn it,

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:07.800
that’s very important.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.940
Is the hidden power of a woman lies in how she cooks.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.960
You see our men cannot go anywhere

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:17.900
because we cook so well they have to come back home.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.960
They remember the food.

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:25.800
So that is the power you have.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.890
Today we are going to have a very short puja

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.870
because today is My Birthday

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:35.900
and so the puja on a birthday should be such that

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:42.870
it should be more deep, more heartfelt, more joyous,

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.020
than it should sort of go on a ritual side.

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.940
There’s no need to have much rituals

01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:51.040
because we are in a joyous mood

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.970
celebrating our Mother’s Birthday.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.850
Already we are there,

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.960
whatever is needed for you to be there

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.950
is not needed now because you are in that joyous mood,

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.950
all right?

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.840
So only thing a very short puja, I have told him,

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.040
is to be done today is a Birthday.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.920
There is no need to have a huge big puja,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.920
all that is needed to bring out all the deities,

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:15.820
they’re already there, up there,

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:17.980
just see the vibrations they are emitting!

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:22.000
They’re so very happy that you are celebrating My Birthday.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.900
So in every puja what we have to do is to awaken them,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.880
ask them to be kind to you, this, that.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.990
Though they are awakened in Me you want them to be.

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.950
But now they’re all awakened in you

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.970
we don’t have to have big puja at all,

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:36.870
there’s no need at all.

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:39.920
And this is what I’ve told Modi that you have a very,

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:43.840
very short puja and a very short puja should be all right.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.980
So today’s talk was just like a puja.

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.000
Remember that this is meant for you

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.890
when you were not Sahaja Yogis.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.880
Today it is not meant for you. So you won’t feel guilty.

01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:59.870
First remember you are Sahaja Yogis,

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:01.960
you are My children and I love you very much,

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.830
very, very much.

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:05.860
So please have confidence in yourself,

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.020
complete confidence in yourself, all right?

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:10.850
That’s the greatest thing you can give Me today

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:14.040
as a present. May God bless you!

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.920
Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:32.970
So for this you have to have washing of My Feet

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:34.930
for ten - five minutes

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.850
and washing of My Hands for about ten minutes,

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:40.020
that’s all, as simple as that.

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:42.030
Now we don’t need many people for that,

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:44.940
just put that thing here.
