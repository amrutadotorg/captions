1
00:52:17,128 --> 00:52:20,128
Please be seated.

2
00:52:26,848 --> 00:52:31,188
He's finished it? What happened?

3
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:36,568
He's finished now?

4
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:05,268
[UNCLEAR] Have you finished or ...

5
00:53:05,508 --> 00:53:09,128
I have finished. Mother, I meant that I just mentioned realization..

6
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:58,088
[UNCLEAR] All right, thank you.

7
00:54:04,728 --> 00:54:08,268
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

8
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:20,608
Yesterday, I explained to you, that

9
00:54:21,188 --> 00:54:26,608
this power lies within you, is your own power

10
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:33,748
and once it is manifested, you will know how great you are.

11
00:54:34,128 --> 00:54:41,108
Just now, you are just thinking that you are an ordinary human-being

12
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:45,228
but once you are connected to the mains,

13
00:54:46,368 --> 00:54:52,368
then you realize what you are. Like this instrument is

14
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:59,268
without it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning - and then you understand your meaning.

15
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:05,688
From human level to a higher level you have to move

16
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:10,628
to know what is Divinity is.

17
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:19,588
This is a happening, this is  a becoming.

18
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:26,588
Like a seed becomes a tree through a living process, you have to become the Spirit.

19
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:29,748
Yesterday I told you,

20
00:55:30,028 --> 00:55:36,888
that I will be able to tell you today about the nature of the Spirit; What is the Spirit?

21
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:45,308
Of course, English language as you know, has it's limitations. Spirit means Atman -

22
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:53,688
the Spirit which is the reflection of God. Also spirit means alcohol,

23
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:58,888
also it means the spirit which is a dead thing.

24
00:55:59,988 --> 00:56:06,128
So, we have to now know, only about the Atman, the One

25
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:10,188
which is the Self within ourselves.

26
00:56:13,748 --> 00:56:19,448
When you are enlightened by the awakening of this power within you

27
00:56:20,808 --> 00:56:28,268
then, the light of the Spirit comes into your attention

28
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:33,148
and then your attention becomes enlightened.

29
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:39,988
Through our Central Nervous System we express our attention

30
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:44,448
but in this nervous system

31
00:56:45,508 --> 00:56:51,788
we have limitations. Firstly, we do not know the Absolute, the Absolute Truth -

32
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:55,408
we live in a relative world.

33
00:56:56,188 --> 00:57:03,608
But once the Spirit shines your attention, you see everything clearly.

34
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:11,348
For example, we are all sitting here, there is light, we can see each other, we know how to relate to each other

35
00:57:11,908 --> 00:57:15,688
and if we have to walk or to sit down,

36
00:57:16,068 --> 00:57:21,808
we know where to sit because we can see everything clearly but when

37
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:28,668
we're not enlightened, whatever ideas we have are mostly mental or emotional

38
00:57:29,688 --> 00:57:35,268
or sometimes coming from our conditioning or from our ego.

39
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:43,088
They do not relate to the Absolute and sometimes not at all to the reality.

40
00:57:44,248 --> 00:57:49,388
So you have to reach the point where you get the Absolute knowledge.

41
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:55,268
Like, just now, I'm sitting before you, you all can see it - it's an Absolute knowledge, you know that I'm sitting here.

42
00:57:57,408 --> 00:58:01,808
But you will not know whether

43
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,308
you should have divorce or not,

44
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:11,748
whether this person is suffering from some madness,

45
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:18,508
or the other person who call himself a guru, is a real guru or false guru - you will not know.

46
00:58:18,888 --> 00:58:26,348
By reasoning you will not know, by rationality you will not know - you cannot find out about a person through rationality

47
00:58:27,188 --> 00:58:33,848
so, there must be some method by which we can get the proof of what

48
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:41,588
is there really existing. So when the attention gets enlightened -

49
00:58:43,308 --> 00:58:51,288
you have felt the other day the cool breeze on your finger-tips and you felt the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area.

50
00:58:52,148 --> 00:58:58,388
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, I said and the Holy Ghost is this All-Pervading power

51
00:58:58,848 --> 00:59:02,168
which is reflected in us as this Kundalini.

52
00:59:03,568 --> 00:59:10,588
So when you know the Absolute, then you can feel it on your finger-tips,

53
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:15,228
your own centers and centers of another person,

54
00:59:15,748 --> 00:59:23,728
so that you become collectively conscious. Means your consciousness develops a new awareness

55
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:30,968
where you are collectively conscious - you know about yourself and you know about others.

56
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:34,508
Now you have to only know, how to correct

57
00:59:36,128 --> 00:59:43,608
the centers, which you have found out to be out of place or something wrong with them or constricted.

58
00:59:44,788 --> 00:59:48,948
If you know how to do it, then you can get cured

59
00:59:49,328 --> 00:59:55,968
and you can cure other people, not on physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual level.

60
00:59:56,528 --> 01:00:01,248
All this could be done, very easily, by you, once you get your Self-realization.

61
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:05,988
Without that you cannot do it

62
01:00:06,988 --> 01:00:12,968
because you do not have the idea of the inner problem that exists.

63
01:00:16,928 --> 01:00:21,908
Supposing there's a tree which is sick and you want to treat it.

64
01:00:22,648 --> 01:00:29,808
No use treating that tree through the leaves, through the branches, through the fruits or through the flowers.

65
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:35,168
Best thing is to go to the roots and this is the knowledge of the roots.

66
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:41,968
We have the knowledge of the tree. This great civilization has grown so big

67
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:49,388
but it has not found out it's roots as yet. But as the tree was growing so big,

68
01:00:49,928 --> 01:00:57,308
also the roots were growing inside and this is the knowledge of the roots, which one has to

69
01:00:57,808 --> 01:01:02,608
just now, listen to it with an open mind as a hypothesis.

70
01:01:03,548 --> 01:01:06,688
So, when these roots are within us -

71
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:12,868
is described in the Bible as the tree of life. I mean, I'm not telling something which was not described.

72
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:20,448
Also, this is said that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames,"

73
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:25,068
and that's how all these chakras look like tongues of flames, specially

74
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:32,208
the Sahastrara, the last chakra looks like beautiful flames of seven colors

75
01:01:32,608 --> 01:01:40,488
and they're burning so smoothly, as if there's no heat in it but some sort of a peace.

76
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:49,128
All this, whatever I'm saying, has to have a proof and that proof you can only get

77
01:01:49,428 --> 01:01:56,108
when you transcend this human awareness into your spiritual awareness.

78
01:01:56,908 --> 01:02:02,348
So the first thing that happens to you, that you become collectively conscious.

79
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:10,288
The second thing, I told you, that you become thoughtlessly aware - to begin with - means you can remain in the present

80
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:15,448
without thinking. Whenever you want you can think, whenever you don't want you need not think.

81
01:02:16,488 --> 01:02:20,648
As a result of that you become a very peaceful personality.

82
01:02:21,628 --> 01:02:28,628
If there's a crisis, suddenly you jump into that position where you're thoughtlessly aware.

83
01:02:29,368 --> 01:02:36,168
Like, as I told you yesterday, that if you're standing in the sea water, you're afraid of the waves

84
01:02:36,468 --> 01:02:42,228
but if you get to the boat you can see all that. In the same way,

85
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:46,868
you just jump on to that state of mind -

86
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:53,688
mind is a wrong word, I should say, because you go beyond mind also - but you go into that state of being

87
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:58,848
where you just see the whole thing as a play - you become a witness.

88
01:02:59,288 --> 01:03:06,288
You become a witness of the whole play and because you're outside the problem, you can solve it much better.

89
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:13,748
Also you have a Divine help by which you can solve your problems and the problems of others.

90
01:03:14,828 --> 01:03:21,288
So the third thing which is very important for the Spirit, is that you know the truth.

91
01:03:22,788 --> 01:03:30,808
Put ten children together who are realized souls and tie their eyes and ask somebody to face.

92
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:39,988
The children will immediately show the same finger, all of them. Supposing they show this finger, you go and ask the person,

93
01:03:40,128 --> 01:03:47,028
"Have you got some trouble with your throat?" "Yes I have, I have a throat cancer but how do you know?"

94
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:53,908
"Because these children have told us. These children what have they told us - just the finger which was burning very badly.

95
01:03:54,268 --> 01:04:02,308
So, must be the cancer or could be some serious because it's burning so badly." And they start, children will start rubbing them and clearing them.

96
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:10,208
When you know gradually through experience

97
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:16,808
that whatever you are recording on your hands is the truth,

98
01:04:17,508 --> 01:04:21,688
then you start accepting it as the truth,

99
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:28,088
then your awareness that is human awareness goes to a new awareness called as vibratory awareness.

100
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:35,328
When your hands are vibrating, you're feeling this cool breeze in your hand and you can feel

101
01:04:36,188 --> 01:04:43,388
your own centers and the centers of others - sometimes they burn, sometimes you get a kind of a tingling,

102
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:48,928
sometimes you get pins and needles or sometimes you also get little burning.

103
01:04:49,628 --> 01:04:55,928
If it's a very horrid person, then might get a little blister for a while just to indicate - you become like a barometer.

104
01:04:56,168 --> 01:05:01,488
But you don't feel bad about it because you just feel it like a barometer and you know what's the problem

105
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:04,968
with the other person is and also your own problem.

106
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:10,568
So, you know the truth about everything. You want to find out about anyone,

107
01:05:10,928 --> 01:05:18,208
you want to know about any book, you want to know about any kind of a knowledge

108
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:26,268
if it is true or not - you have to just put your hands and ask, "Is this the truth?"

109
01:05:27,828 --> 01:05:35,228
"Is there God?" Many people say, "We don't believe in God." I think, is very unscientific to say like that, "We don't believe in God."

110
01:05:35,728 --> 01:05:40,608
Because you have not yet found it out. Unless and until you found out there is God or not,

111
01:05:40,808 --> 01:05:45,208
how can you say that, "I don't believe in God," - it is great arrogance, I think.

112
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:50,308
So is best is, to find out. If you ask a question, "Is there God," -

113
01:05:50,508 --> 01:05:54,648
if you are realized soul,  immediately you'll start getting tremendous vibrations.

114
01:05:56,228 --> 01:06:01,488
That is how it works and gradually, you don't have to

115
01:06:01,808 --> 01:06:08,168
see on your vibrations but you just know the truth - you just know it what is the truth.

116
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:15,148
Immediately as soon as you see the person, you know about him, as soon as you listen to someone, you know about him -

117
01:06:15,668 --> 01:06:22,388
it's becomes very clear and vivid. There's no problem then how to find out

118
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:28,308
what is the truth - so you get all the proofs of it, all the proofs of it.

119
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:32,108
Now the third thing,

120
01:06:33,388 --> 01:06:38,628
which I've told you, is the spiritual part of it.

121
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:44,348
Of course, you become a witness, you become absolutely peaceful

122
01:06:44,908 --> 01:06:50,048
and the most important thing that you get is the joy.

123
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:55,488
Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness.

124
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:59,568
Unhappiness comes when your ego is hurt

125
01:06:59,908 --> 01:07:04,868
or your conditionings are hurt, your emotions are hurt

126
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:12,428
and you feel happy when ego is pampered or your emotions are substantiated.

127
01:07:13,168 --> 01:07:17,888
But joy is something which doesn't have this double face - joy is Absolute.

128
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:24,308
So, you start enjoying everything. For example, now see there's a beautiful carpet here,

129
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:28,628
I watch it without thinking

130
01:07:29,448 --> 01:07:34,768
and whatever the artist has put the joy in it, starts pouring on My head

131
01:07:35,748 --> 01:07:39,908
just like a soothing river Ganges, as they say

132
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:45,288
because I don't think about it, I'm just watching it.

133
01:07:45,848 --> 01:07:53,088
Artist must have involved himself with great joy to do it in an abstract way but that all abstract,

134
01:07:53,388 --> 01:07:57,568
just reflects on Me and starts flowing down.

135
01:08:01,088 --> 01:08:07,768
This joy becomes then the main nourishing factor in your life.

136
01:08:08,548 --> 01:08:13,388
Your family life changes, husband wife's relations change,

137
01:08:13,948 --> 01:08:18,108
children's relations change, relation of the whole

138
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:23,208
sahaja yoga brotherhood comes absolutely spontaneously.

139
01:08:23,888 --> 01:08:30,368
I don't have to tell you to 'Love thy neighbor' - you just love, you enjoy.

140
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:34,028
The first time you enjoy another personality.

141
01:08:34,508 --> 01:08:42,048
For example now, they must have told you, we are working in fifty-five nations, it's more than that, I think, but still fifty-five

142
01:08:42,308 --> 01:08:45,608
is all right to make it look all right.

143
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:52,128
These fifty-five nations have got people of different nature,

144
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:57,208
different temperament, different culture, different

145
01:08:57,228 --> 01:09:03,068
uh.. races, different religions and when they meet

146
01:09:04,148 --> 01:09:11,108
they look so beautiful, they never fight, they never argue,

147
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:19,928
they never think of jealousies, there's no hatred of any kind,

148
01:09:20,368 --> 01:09:25,768
they do not value you what your skin is or what your position is

149
01:09:26,188 --> 01:09:31,548
everyone feels that they are part and parcel of the whole

150
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:36,248
and enjoy each other. If there's a problem -

151
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:43,208
first when I went to Russia first, who came there you'll be surprised

152
01:09:43,588 --> 01:09:47,768
were the Germans, just came rushing to help Me.

153
01:09:48,108 --> 01:09:52,688
I said, "How are you here?" "Mother, don't you think, is our responsibility?"

154
01:09:53,048 --> 01:10:00,808
Really, I was filled with joy and tears. I said look at these Germans and they became so gentle with them,

155
01:10:01,148 --> 01:10:08,368
so gentle with the Russians that Russians were amazed how these Germans could be so gentle!

156
01:10:09,008 --> 01:10:14,388
But the feeling that they had that these Russians must be brought

157
01:10:15,228 --> 01:10:22,288
to reality, so that they'll have better life, like we are enjoying, they should also enjoy.

158
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:28,568
This joy is so great that people want to spread it.

159
01:10:29,988 --> 01:10:36,968
As you know that I'm a housewife, I have children, I have grandchildren and I'm very busy otherwise also

160
01:10:37,408 --> 01:10:44,148
but I can't help it, I have to travel for this joy because I cannot enjoy it Myself,

161
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:50,868
I must enjoy it with all of you and it's very simple that you can achieve the state

162
01:10:51,188 --> 01:10:55,228
of your Spirit because it's very important.

163
01:10:55,808 --> 01:11:03,288
This is for the emancipation for the whole world because all our problems come from us only, from human-beings.

164
01:11:03,588 --> 01:11:10,248
Once they're transformed, you'll be amazed how things work out.

165
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:14,828
Also materially, I've seen, all of them are very much helped

166
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:23,228
because they become so smart, so intelligent, so compassionate, so good, that somehow or the other, everything works out.

167
01:11:24,328 --> 01:11:29,848
I was asking them, "Is there anybody unemployed in sahaja yoga?"

168
01:11:30,408 --> 01:11:36,708
They said, "None." In Australia, can you imagine? But in England, which is much worse,

169
01:11:36,908 --> 01:11:41,528
there's nobody unemployed in sahaja yoga - everybody is doing very well.

170
01:11:41,828 --> 01:11:47,308
You ask them, "How are you?" "Oh Mother, we're swimming in the ocean of joy."

171
01:11:48,828 --> 01:11:54,348
All those complaints, all those aggressions, everything has disappeared

172
01:11:54,608 --> 01:12:00,008
and they have become such beautiful people like angels, absolutely like angels

173
01:12:00,288 --> 01:12:07,928
and you all are capable of becoming that. You all have those powers, just you have to get them

174
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:16,368
and you have to desire, you have to desire and that's how it is going to work out.

175
01:12:18,528 --> 01:12:26,008
It is such a big subject and I must have given at least four to five thousand lectures, in only in English language

176
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:30,688
and many in other languages. So you can imagine that

177
01:12:30,988 --> 01:12:37,868
this subject cannot be covered in one or two days but I'm sorry I cannot uh.. spend more time

178
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:44,888
in Melbourne or in Australia also. That's My life is but whatever it is,

179
01:12:45,188 --> 01:12:48,328
what you have to get is your Self-realization.

180
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:53,588
After getting the Self-realization, though the Kundalini has

181
01:12:54,488 --> 01:13:02,428
got out of your fontanel bone area, has touched the mains, everything is there, but still there's [UNCLEAR - I MEAN?] a very

182
01:13:03,608 --> 01:13:09,128
small part of Kundalini is, few threads of Kundalini have done that

183
01:13:09,508 --> 01:13:14,728
and also there are problems with your physical side or mental side, emotional side - whatever it is -

184
01:13:14,988 --> 01:13:19,848
so it has to go back to correct you. It goes back to correct you again and again

185
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:26,328
so you have to only learn how to make this connection perfect and whole being to be purified.

186
01:13:26,628 --> 01:13:32,908
Now for that you don't have to go to Himalayas or do any kind of penance, sacrifice, fasting - nothing,

187
01:13:33,268 --> 01:13:37,468
it's not needed at all. Only thing, you have to come to the collective.

188
01:13:37,808 --> 01:13:45,168
We have very simple type of collective because we don't take money or anything - you can't pay for it - it's so invaluable that you can't pay.

189
01:13:45,448 --> 01:13:49,768
How much will you pay? How much do we pay to Mother Earth for these beautiful flowers?

190
01:13:50,188 --> 01:13:54,088
You can't pay for it. So people, who are sahaja yogies,

191
01:13:54,348 --> 01:14:01,388
have, somehow or the other, gathered a little money and they have a little place where they're having meditation forum - it's a humble place.

192
01:14:01,788 --> 01:14:06,988
You should humble down and come there and join the collective.

193
01:14:07,368 --> 01:14:12,848
Once you join the collective, you'll be amazed that you'll be cleansed automatically.

194
01:14:13,228 --> 01:14:18,028
Automatically you'll be cleansed, also they'll tell you how to meditate at home.

195
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:22,548
Just try and you'll be amazed that

196
01:14:23,148 --> 01:14:26,728
you are really glorious, you are really beautiful

197
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:31,088
and there is a purpose to our life. We are not born

198
01:14:31,728 --> 01:14:35,128
just by chance - there's a very big purpose

199
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:39,668
and when you discover that you'll know your value and your identity.

200
01:14:42,388 --> 01:14:48,968
So, May God bless you! I'm very happy today you're all here, we should uh..

201
01:14:49,628 --> 01:14:53,328
now have the session for meditation by which

202
01:14:53,588 --> 01:14:57,308
I'm sure, you all can get your realization - I have no doubts about it.

203
01:15:04,228 --> 01:15:09,588
You see, I can go on talking for hours but, I think, talking is not going to help.

204
01:15:11,468 --> 01:15:16,528
But some people have questions, I don't mind answering the questions.

205
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:22,588
But the questions should be relevant, please and should be

206
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:28,188
such that you really desire to have your Self-realization

207
01:15:29,008 --> 01:15:36,008
because I'm not here to take anything from you, it's your own property, everything, I may just give you the key.

208
01:15:39,308 --> 01:15:45,168
And if you ask Me any questions - of course, I'm quite an expert now because I've be doing this for the last

209
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:53,008
twenty-one years, so, I'm quite an expert but even if I answer your question, that doesn't guarantee that you'll get your realization,

210
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:59,688
doesn't guarantee - it's just a mental feat. So, what you have to think of is your Self-realization

211
01:16:00,028 --> 01:16:03,628
that you should all get it - that is to be desired.

212
01:16:15,068 --> 01:16:20,008
- Doesn't appear to be any questions, Shri Mataji
- Umm?
- There are no questions.

213
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:25,848
Are you sure? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right. They're wonderful people, really.

214
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:32,388
This time I'm really meeting very beautiful people in Australia, really, I must tell you.

215
01:16:33,308 --> 01:16:37,888
Even in Perth, there were such nice people - all of them got realization.

216
01:16:38,148 --> 01:16:43,748
And yesterday also you saw, how everybody got realization. But now the connection

217
01:16:43,928 --> 01:16:48,208
has to be established permanently. For that you have to give some time -

218
01:16:48,668 --> 01:16:52,808
that's the main thing, we don't give any time to ourselves.

219
01:16:53,808 --> 01:17:01,788
After all, we have these watches all the time to save the time but to save the time, to waste it.

220
01:17:03,288 --> 01:17:07,288
We have to give little time to ourselves, to our realization

221
01:17:07,868 --> 01:17:14,228
and morning and evening, say five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening, if you do meditation at home, is all right.

222
01:17:14,408 --> 01:17:21,408
Once a week they meet where you can go - they'll give you all the necessary information that you want, whatever you want

223
01:17:22,008 --> 01:17:29,848
and you don't have to pay anything. If they ask any money, you let Me know - they will never ask.

224
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:36,428
[INAUDIBLE]

225
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:40,508
Wonderful!

226
01:17:51,488 --> 01:17:58,648
So at the very outset, I have to tell you, that I respect your freedom.

227
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:06,728
Human-beings have been given freedom to choose and I cannot force on you

228
01:18:07,368 --> 01:18:11,768
Self-realization - no, I cannot. It cannot be done.

229
01:18:12,648 --> 01:18:15,968
So, you have to have that desire within you

230
01:18:16,288 --> 01:18:22,048
and Kundalini is the power of pure desire within you because all other desires

231
01:18:22,368 --> 01:18:25,368
are never satiable, in general.

232
01:18:26,008 --> 01:18:31,548
So you have to have desire within you  that you want to have your realization.

233
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:39,848
Now the first condition is, that you have to be absolutely self-confident.

234
01:18:40,328 --> 01:18:44,488
You shouldn't have diffidence about yourself - how can I get it,

235
01:18:45,328 --> 01:18:48,408
how will it work it out?

236
01:18:49,228 --> 01:18:54,328
We have so many ideas about ourselves and we start judging ourselves

237
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:58,448
Please don't judge yourself. Your Kundalini will judge

238
01:18:58,628 --> 01:19:02,508
and She will tell you what is wrong with you and She will manage you.

239
01:19:02,788 --> 01:19:06,848
She has been waiting all these years to give you this second birth - She's your mother.

240
01:19:07,428 --> 01:19:13,008
She will find Her way and She'll manage everything. You don't have to

241
01:19:13,488 --> 01:19:18,488
trouble yourself and tell yourself that this is wrong with me, that is wrong with me.

242
01:19:20,028 --> 01:19:26,668
So first of all, you must have full self-confidence that we are going to get Self-realization

243
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:34,268
and that we are going to grow completely into our spiritual awareness. You have please, that self-confidence in yourself.

244
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:40,068
Whatever you might have done, forget it at this moment. You have to be in the present and here

245
01:19:40,328 --> 01:19:44,168
you're perfectly all right and suitable for your ascent.

246
01:19:45,568 --> 01:19:49,888
The another thing is that, you don't have to think you're guilty

247
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:54,288
This is also another, I think, like a fashion, everybody feels guilty.

248
01:19:54,628 --> 01:20:01,208
What is there to feel guilty, what wrong have you done. After all you are human-beings. If the human-beings

249
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:08,088
make mistakes, what's wrong with that? You're not gods - if you've done mistakes, it's all right.

250
01:20:08,448 --> 01:20:15,508
Forget about it but don't feel guilty. If you feel guilty, then this center here, on the left side, catches

251
01:20:15,828 --> 01:20:21,388
which is a terrible center because it gives you horrible diseases like Angina,

252
01:20:21,588 --> 01:20:29,068
it gives you Spondylitis, also it gives you lethargic organs - so please, don't feel guilty.

253
01:20:29,468 --> 01:20:34,528
I don't know how this idea came into the people who were in charge of

254
01:20:34,828 --> 01:20:40,428
religion and God, that you all should feel guilty - is wrong.

255
01:20:42,008 --> 01:20:48,408
Absolutely wrong that you should suffer - this is another wrong. Christ has suffered for us -

256
01:20:48,888 --> 01:20:53,548
are we going to suffer more than Him? We don't have to suffer.

257
01:20:53,908 --> 01:21:00,648
All these ideas must be that you suffer, you fast and give us the money - must be that.

258
01:21:01,128 --> 01:21:08,148
I just can't understand, why to tell somebody to suffer - because God Almighty is your Father.

259
01:21:09,428 --> 01:21:13,148
and He is the essence of fatherhood.

260
01:21:14,548 --> 01:21:22,028
He's the greatest father you could think of and how can any loving father want his children to suffer?

261
01:21:22,828 --> 01:21:26,008
Logically you must understand this -

262
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:31,788
why should you suffer? He's created all this beautiful world for you

263
01:21:32,428 --> 01:21:36,848
You should not suffer at all - so the idea of suffering should go away.

264
01:21:37,068 --> 01:21:42,628
It's becoming too much these days, the way people are taking to sufferings, for nothing at all.

265
01:21:44,888 --> 01:21:51,588
There are so many such principles, uh.. which are being sold in the market, that you have to suffer.

266
01:21:51,768 --> 01:21:56,648
And there was one in England which came to say, that you must go to Gobi desert.

267
01:21:57,408 --> 01:22:04,408
And now, Gobi desert if you go, you'll get Nirvana according to them. Of course you'll die, that's the Nirvana you'll get, no doubt.

268
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:08,868
The simple thing is to go to Gobi desert without any water -

269
01:22:09,008 --> 01:22:16,008
within say, five, six minutes, you will die - there's nothing will be left out of you, so there's nothing to uh..

270
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:21,288
suffer but it's a straight forward march to your death, that's all.

271
01:22:21,848 --> 01:22:28,528
So all these nonsensical ideas are to be given up. Nobody has to suffer,

272
01:22:28,948 --> 01:22:36,508
nobody has to think that they have to fast - of course, if you want to fast for your health, [UNCLEAR] that's different - but not for God.

273
01:22:38,408 --> 01:22:43,228
Is something uh... so absurd

274
01:22:45,408 --> 01:22:53,408
and ridiculous to make someone suffer, to tell somebody that you're a sinner - is all absurdly very cruel also,

275
01:22:53,908 --> 01:22:59,308
extremely cruel, while this All-Pervading power is the love of God.

276
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:05,768
He loves us. This is what

277
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:11,328
we should see in any person who talks of God or talks of religion.

278
01:23:11,548 --> 01:23:17,308
That's what they all said but the religions have gone, you know where they have gone to

279
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:24,548
because they didn't seek the truth, they didn't seek the Spirit.

280
01:23:25,248 --> 01:23:32,208
If they had deviated, they are responsible for such a thing.

281
01:23:32,828 --> 01:23:37,508
They need not have done all this; They should have, really, found out what is reality.

282
01:23:38,248 --> 01:23:42,028
But they were very much against people who found out

283
01:23:42,348 --> 01:23:46,908
and tortured them, troubled them, killed them - did all kinds of things.

284
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:56,428
But now, they cannot do anything because now this All-Pervading power has become dynamic.

285
01:23:56,968 --> 01:24:02,828
It looks after you, it protects, it worries about you - no one can touch you.

286
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:08,568
Those days are gone when saints had to suffer.

287
01:24:12,388 --> 01:24:19,188
So just now, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

288
01:24:19,648 --> 01:24:26,668
not to be angry with yourself or anything. Just to be very pleasantly placed that you are a human-being

289
01:24:27,348 --> 01:24:35,368
and the epitome of evolution and that you have to just travel a little more to reach there.

290
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:47,188
All right. The third condition which is also another very simple one is this

291
01:24:47,928 --> 01:24:50,968
that you have to forgive everyone.

292
01:24:52,428 --> 01:24:58,248
As I told you the other day, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - actually you don't do anything.

293
01:24:58,908 --> 01:25:02,988
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

294
01:25:05,508 --> 01:25:12,608
But always I've seen people say, it's very difficult to forgive. What is difficult - just to say, "I forgive everyone," - finished.

295
01:25:13,628 --> 01:25:20,628
In general you forgive. Don't think of those people because by thinking about them also you play into wrong hands.

296
01:25:21,648 --> 01:25:28,608
So just forgive all of them. Just try, it's very simple, just to say - it's a mantra you can call it.

297
01:25:28,988 --> 01:25:35,448
"I forgive all of them, in general," just say that and you'll feel much lighter within yourself,

298
01:25:35,768 --> 01:25:41,288
much better, just forgive. Why to carry this load on your head for nothing at all.

299
01:25:48,628 --> 01:25:55,108
I hope, you'll fulfill these three conditions which are very simple. One is the self-confidence,

300
01:25:55,648 --> 01:26:01,328
second is no guilt and the third one is forgiving everyone.

301
01:26:03,288 --> 01:26:07,688
All right, so now we are placed very pleasantly towards ourselves

302
01:26:08,048 --> 01:26:14,688
and we're sure we're going to get our Self-realization. We have to enter into the Kingdom of God - how can you be guilty?

303
01:26:18,928 --> 01:26:21,948
All right, so now

304
01:26:23,828 --> 01:26:31,648
there's one request is to take out your shoes because that helps you a lot to clear out your

305
01:26:32,928 --> 01:26:39,588
problems by the Mother Earth. She's very kind, She's the kindest thing that you can think of.

306
01:27:02,328 --> 01:27:08,188
Now, please put both the feet apart from each other

307
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:12,008
because the left side

308
01:27:12,748 --> 01:27:18,528
is for your power of desire, ordinary desire.

309
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:25,528
Kundalini is for pure desire and the right side is for your action.

310
01:27:31,628 --> 01:27:36,288
Now we'll tell you in the beginning, how we're going to proceed

311
01:27:36,528 --> 01:27:41,308
and then you can close your eyes. I hope you're pleasantly placed towards yourself.

312
01:27:44,188 --> 01:27:52,028
Now, please put your left hand towards Me, like this, on your lap, on your lap very comfortably. You don't have to do anything

313
01:27:52,348 --> 01:27:58,648
uh.. which is troublesome or painful, just like this and the right hand on your heart.

314
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:05,608
Left hand on your lap and right hand on your heart.

315
01:28:07,008 --> 01:28:12,048
In the heart resides the Spirit

316
01:28:14,268 --> 01:28:20,408
and if this Spirit comes into your attention, then you have

317
01:28:22,048 --> 01:28:27,788
the light of the Spirit and in that light you become your own guide,

318
01:28:29,928 --> 01:28:36,548
you become your own master, you become your own guru. So please,

319
01:28:36,948 --> 01:28:44,868
now take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is the center of

320
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:52,668
your mastery which is created by great masters for you.

321
01:28:59,048 --> 01:29:04,888
Now, please take your right hand the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

322
01:29:07,768 --> 01:29:15,608
This is the center for pure knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have, is not pure knowledge

323
01:29:15,888 --> 01:29:20,528
but this is pure knowledge because it gives you the knowledge about

324
01:29:20,928 --> 01:29:24,348
the laws of the Divine.

325
01:29:25,048 --> 01:29:29,648
It makes you capable of working it out.

326
01:29:30,748 --> 01:29:37,748
This is the pure knowledge you should have. Of course, we have another kind of knowledge, as you know, is black magic, this and that

327
01:29:38,068 --> 01:29:41,068
but this is pure knowledge of the Divine.

328
01:29:42,188 --> 01:29:47,368
Now, you raise your right hand, in the upper portion of the abdomen again, and push it down.

329
01:29:47,748 --> 01:29:52,268
This is the center again of, as I told you, of your mastery.

330
01:29:52,648 --> 01:29:59,028
Then you put your hand on your heart where resides the Spirit.

331
01:30:00,808 --> 01:30:07,368
Now you raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your face to your right.

332
01:30:08,328 --> 01:30:15,128
Now this is the center, I've already told you, when it is out of gear, you get diseases like Angina -

333
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:21,408
so, don't feel guilty. Just now, I feel, all of you have this one the worst.

334
01:30:21,688 --> 01:30:25,068
What is there to feel guilty, I don't know.

335
01:30:26,848 --> 01:30:34,788
Please don't feel guilty. All right, now you have to take your right hand on your forehead across -

336
01:30:35,048 --> 01:30:40,928
you can put it this way that on one side your fingers, another side your

337
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:49,168
thumb and you can press it. Now, bend your head slowly forward, as far as possible.

338
01:30:50,808 --> 01:30:54,748
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

339
01:30:56,488 --> 01:31:02,748
Now, please take this right hand on the back side of your head, back side of your head, on the optic lobe

340
01:31:02,968 --> 01:31:06,888
and hold it tight. Now, push back your head as far as possible.

341
01:31:08,568 --> 01:31:15,728
Now, this is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

342
01:31:15,968 --> 01:31:22,648
just for your own satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from

343
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:25,828
this All-Pervading power of love.

344
01:31:26,288 --> 01:31:32,788
Now, the last center is the most important. Stretch your hands, stretch your palm, push back your fingers.

345
01:31:33,188 --> 01:31:38,948
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

346
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:45,228
which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, put down your head as far as possible,

347
01:31:45,868 --> 01:31:52,208
press it hard, by pushing out your fingers only, that's important. Now, push the scalp

348
01:31:52,428 --> 01:31:58,628
and move it seven times clockwise, slowly, move it seven times clockwise.

349
01:31:59,768 --> 01:32:03,308
Please put down your head, put down your head.

350
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:16,848
That's all is to be done, that's all. Now

351
01:32:19,348 --> 01:32:26,228
again, please take out your shoes, put your feet apart from each other, please put left hand towards Me.

352
01:32:27,468 --> 01:32:31,468
You can take out your spectacles, also if there's something

353
01:32:31,848 --> 01:32:36,668
tight on your neck or on your waist, you may take it out

354
01:32:39,288 --> 01:32:47,228
or say, loosen it I mean to say, if there's something, just take out the pressure, if there is any. That's all.

355
01:32:50,768 --> 01:32:55,248
Now, please put the left hand towards Me on your lap

356
01:32:55,768 --> 01:32:59,348
comfortably and the right hand on your heart.

357
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:08,688
Close the eyes, please close the eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

358
01:33:08,928 --> 01:33:12,608
Please close the eyes, you can remove your spectacles also.

359
01:33:15,248 --> 01:33:22,368
Now here, you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself,

360
01:33:24,048 --> 01:33:30,368
three times in your heart - you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

361
01:33:31,128 --> 01:33:38,508
Now the question is, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

362
01:33:55,508 --> 01:34:00,948
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

363
01:34:01,688 --> 01:34:09,408
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it little hard.

364
01:34:10,348 --> 01:34:15,188
Here you have to ask another fundamental question in your heart,

365
01:34:16,188 --> 01:34:20,348
"Mother, am I my own master?"

366
01:34:27,448 --> 01:34:33,548
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

367
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:37,768
so I cannot force

368
01:34:40,548 --> 01:34:44,028
pure knowledge on you.

369
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:52,608
So now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side,

370
01:35:03,088 --> 01:35:08,708
press it hard. Here you have to say, I mean you have to ask -

371
01:35:08,968 --> 01:35:16,008
because I cannot force pure knowledge on you - six times because this center has got six petals,

372
01:35:16,668 --> 01:35:20,328
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

373
01:35:51,848 --> 01:35:57,908
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising upward, so we have

374
01:35:58,168 --> 01:36:02,628
to nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence.

375
01:36:02,948 --> 01:36:09,648
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it and here

376
01:36:09,928 --> 01:36:14,928
you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

377
01:36:15,808 --> 01:36:23,368
"Mother, I am my own master, Mother, I am my own master,"

378
01:36:24,268 --> 01:36:28,088
or, "Mother, I am my own guru."

379
01:36:40,748 --> 01:36:47,508
The fundamental truth about you is that you're not this body, this mind,

380
01:36:48,008 --> 01:36:55,508
this ego, these conditionings, these emotions but you are pure Spirit.

381
01:36:57,468 --> 01:37:02,928
So now, raise your hand on top of your heart and here

382
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:07,528
you have to say with full confidence again, twelve times,

383
01:37:10,808 --> 01:37:14,668
"Mother, I am pure Spirit."

384
01:37:15,848 --> 01:37:20,408
Twelve times, "Mother, I am pure Spirit."

385
01:37:34,668 --> 01:37:37,668
This All-Pervading power

386
01:37:40,508 --> 01:37:45,688
of love is the ocean of knowledge,

387
01:37:46,028 --> 01:37:51,668
is the ocean of compassion and blisses

388
01:37:52,308 --> 01:37:58,328
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

389
01:37:59,228 --> 01:38:04,788
and whatever you may do - mistakes as they call them

390
01:38:06,168 --> 01:38:13,348
can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

391
01:38:23,528 --> 01:38:26,568
So now, raise your right hand

392
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:36,468
into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right.

393
01:38:40,688 --> 01:38:43,828
Here you have to say with full confidence,

394
01:38:45,288 --> 01:38:53,008
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it sixteen times because this has sixteen petals.

395
01:38:53,368 --> 01:39:01,268
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it with full confidence, sixteen times.

396
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:20,428
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

397
01:39:21,968 --> 01:39:28,268
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and suffer,

398
01:39:29,128 --> 01:39:36,048
torture yourself, while the person who has tortured you or troubled you, is quite happy.

399
01:39:38,488 --> 01:39:46,388
So please, you have to forgive all those, in general,

400
01:39:47,128 --> 01:39:50,968
who have given you trouble.

401
01:39:52,168 --> 01:39:58,668
So now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead, put it across

402
01:39:58,968 --> 01:40:05,808
with fingers on one side and the thumb on the other and now, put it down your head.

403
01:40:06,648 --> 01:40:11,588
Press it and put it down. Here you have to say,

404
01:40:11,888 --> 01:40:15,988
not how many times but from your heart,

405
01:40:16,668 --> 01:40:21,808
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

406
01:40:23,028 --> 01:40:29,548
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." This you have to say

407
01:40:33,848 --> 01:40:41,848
with full confidence, with your heart, from your heart -

408
01:40:45,068 --> 01:40:52,388
not how many times. It's very important because this is a very constricted

409
01:40:52,768 --> 01:41:00,108
center and if you don't say this and you don't forgive all of them, Kundalini won't rise, so please,

410
01:41:01,448 --> 01:41:08,628
you have to say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

411
01:41:12,008 --> 01:41:18,688
Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head

412
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:22,008
and push back your head as far as possible.

413
01:41:25,148 --> 01:41:33,208
Here again, you have to say it from your heart, not how many times, without counting your mistakes,

414
01:41:33,888 --> 01:41:38,568
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

415
01:41:38,888 --> 01:41:44,268
you have to say from your heart, not how many times, again I say,

416
01:41:48,128 --> 01:41:52,088
"Oh Divine power, if I have done

417
01:41:52,308 --> 01:41:56,548
anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

418
01:41:57,668 --> 01:42:03,428
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong

419
01:42:03,848 --> 01:42:07,548
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

420
01:42:19,128 --> 01:42:23,308
Now, stretch your hand fully

421
01:42:25,368 --> 01:42:32,968
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

422
01:42:34,668 --> 01:42:41,748
and here you have to push back your fingers and put down your head.

423
01:42:43,348 --> 01:42:49,468
Now again, I respect your freedom and I cannot force Self-realization on you.

424
01:42:50,228 --> 01:42:57,068
So, you have to move your scalp with a pressure, seven times, very slowly,

425
01:42:57,348 --> 01:43:02,728

01:43:39,128 --> 01:43:45,228
Now please take down your hands, please open your eyes slowly.

433
01:43:45,948 --> 01:43:51,488
Please put both the hands, like this, towards Me, little higher.

434
01:43:52,188 --> 01:43:56,408
Now watch Me without thinking.

435
01:44:04,108 --> 01:44:09,108
Now, put the right hand towards Me like this, and

436
01:44:11,528 --> 01:44:16,048
put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area.

437
01:44:16,228 --> 01:44:21,208
The fontanel bone area doesn't mean that you touch it but away from it

438
01:44:21,628 --> 01:44:29,428
just hold it, bend your head and just hold it and see for yourself if there's a cool or a warm

439
01:44:30,048 --> 01:44:35,468
breeze like waves are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

440
01:44:35,688 --> 01:44:41,268
You have to certify, please try to put it little away from your head.

441
01:44:41,468 --> 01:44:48,388
Sometimes it can be quite far away so be careful, move your hand up and down and see for yourself,

442
01:44:48,628 --> 01:44:52,948
if there's a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

443
01:44:53,548 --> 01:45:01,368
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, it can be warm - if you've not forgiven it would be quite warm - so please forgive even now.

444
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:09,888
Now try with the left hand. Put down your right, head again and see with your right hand,

445
01:45:10,148 --> 01:45:17,908
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves coming through your fontanel bone area.

446
01:45:19,348 --> 01:45:27,308
Now again with the right hand, again put down your head and see for yourself

447
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:33,668
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves

are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

449
01:45:43,428 --> 01:45:49,168
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky, push back your head

450
01:45:49,488 --> 01:45:55,008
and now here you have to ask one of these following questions, one of them,

451
01:45:55,188 --> 01:45:59,648
three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

452
01:46:01,608 --> 01:46:09,088
or, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya,

453
01:46:09,508 --> 01:46:14,848
is this the Brahma Chaitanya?" Ask one of these questions three times in your heart.

454
01:46:24,388 --> 01:46:27,868
Now please take down your hands.

455
01:46:31,128 --> 01:46:34,128
You'll feel very relaxed.
