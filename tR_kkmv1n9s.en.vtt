WEBVTT

27:10.347 --> 27:20.987
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

27:21.012 --> 27:35.142
I am very happy that this book is now published
and a subtler side, a deeper dimension of

27:35.142 --> 27:43.250
‘Gita’ is being brought, to the readers.

27:46.234 --> 28:03.172
As Krishna was a great diplomat and understood
that human beings are very clever and they

28:03.172 --> 28:07.392
cannot accept truth in a straightforward manner.

28:07.392 --> 28:20.752
He, in His advice to Arjuna used His diplomacy
and the essence of His diplomacy is always

28:20.752 --> 28:33.101
specially of the defined, Divine Diplomacy
which He used that give absurd conditions

28:33.101 --> 28:42.642
and solutions to such difficult people who
are so proud of their limited intellect.

28:45.068 --> 28:48.964
That’s a difference between a father and
a mother I should say.

28:48.989 --> 28:51.153
As we say in Hindi ‘Sidhe Haath ghee na
nikle tho tedhii ungli karni pardti hai’

28:51.178 --> 28:56.125
[Meaning: when we can’t take out ghee with
straight finger, we have to bend our finger.

28:56.150 --> 29:00.299
Famous proverb implying that when we can’t
get a work done in a straight way, we need

29:00.324 --> 29:01.875
to bend our ways.].

29:02.082 --> 29:13.401
The first and foremost thing we have to understand
that Shri Krishna is a Divine incarnation

29:14.952 --> 29:27.142
and He came at a time where we needed to understand
what is the essence of dharma.

29:27.142 --> 29:36.499
For example I have been quite surprised the
way people explain Him

29:36.524 --> 29:40.964
as far as the hinsa is concerned.

29:43.022 --> 29:48.052
That Shri Krishna preached ahinsa to such
an extent that we have to look after all the

29:48.052 --> 29:50.553
mosquitoes of Delhi.

29:50.625 --> 30:09.452
Such absurd things people have deducted by
what Krishna tried to emphasize in Shri Gita.

30:09.452 --> 30:24.072
When the war started, Arjuna actually became
nervous I can say and He said, “I would

30:24.072 --> 30:30.787
not like to fight My own kith and kin and
My Gurus.”

30:31.192 --> 30:39.362
So Shri Krishna says, “They are already
dead, they are killed.

30:39.362 --> 30:42.036
Because they were not enlightened people,

30:42.061 --> 30:45.946
are already dead people their eyes are not open.

30:46.208 --> 30:50.153
Whom are You going to kill here?

30:50.248 --> 30:56.602
Just You have to remove some people from this
Earth to establish Dharma."

30:57.602 --> 31:03.643
Now the idea of Dharma according to us is
some sort of a Hinduism or Islamism or some

31:03.643 --> 31:07.147
sort of a ism; it is not.

31:07.172 --> 31:15.302
Dharma is the valency in a human being just
like carbon has four valencies; dharma has

31:15.302 --> 31:17.732
ten valencies in a human being.

31:17.732 --> 31:24.412
And when a person falls down from there then
he loses his powers as a human being.

31:26.510 --> 31:33.532
One of the examples He said at the time of
war – Karna the great generous man very

31:33.532 --> 31:46.372
well known for His great virtues was caught
up by a wheel of His chariot and He could

31:46.372 --> 31:50.412
not take out His leg out of that chariot.

31:50.412 --> 32:08.482
When Arjuna faced Him and raised His own Gandiva
and Karna challenged Him saying that, “I

32:08.482 --> 32:22.921
am a Vira” – a chivalrous person, a person
who is fighting, “and You are another warrior

32:22.946 --> 32:33.639
and in Dharma when I have no weapons on Me,
You cannot kill Me with Your  weapons.”

32:34.233 --> 32:40.882
That time Shri Krishna pointed at Him like
this and He said, “Kill Him.

32:40.882 --> 32:49.748
Where was His warrior virtues when Draupadi
was insulted?

32:49.986 --> 32:56.030
Draupadi’s insult was the greatest sin that
was committed and

32:56.055 --> 32:59.364
what was He doing at that time?”

33:00.411 --> 33:04.910
And Arjuna killed Karna.

33:07.966 --> 33:10.549
This is Dharma.

33:13.691 --> 33:24.625
He’s called as the Leeladhara – the one
for Him the whole world is a play.

33:24.650 --> 33:30.362
And that’s why He says that already they
are killed.

33:30.772 --> 33:35.081
That doesn’t mean that you start killing
people, becoming violent

33:35.106 --> 33:37.606
because you do not agree with some people.

33:38.618 --> 33:44.100
Shri Krishna can say whom to kill.

33:44.821 --> 33:54.201
You have to be a realized soul to understand
why Shri Krishna had to ask Him to kill and

33:54.201 --> 34:00.100
why the Goddess had to kill so many demons.

34:02.321 --> 34:11.887
But the idea today is – we should try to
be sympathetic towards also demons and the

34:11.912 --> 34:19.081
devils who are spreading ‘asuri vidya’
everywhere.

34:22.582 --> 34:27.577
And we should be sympathetic with all the
people and there is good in everyone.

34:27.602 --> 34:30.261
That is not Krishna’s message.

34:32.306 --> 34:37.597
He showed His love by killing the demons.

34:40.022 --> 34:48.914
I don’t know in this book if I have talked
on this point or not because he had very limited

34:48.939 --> 34:52.639
subjects, which he dealt with, and I didn’t
want to pressurize him

34:52.664 --> 34:55.318
with some new subject matters.

34:55.343 --> 35:01.342
But there’s one thing definitely, which
I didn’t say there which is a very important

35:01.342 --> 35:04.671
point one should try to see.

35:06.752 --> 35:20.421
That the awareness – ‘Chetana’, the
awareness, grows downward of a human being

35:20.421 --> 35:27.936
and the roots of the tree of the awareness
are in the brain.

35:28.992 --> 35:37.804
So one has to take to ‘urdvagati’ – means
the ascent and not to the descent.

35:38.312 --> 35:48.302
A human being is born in the Bhavasagara,
which is as we call in the void, as you can

35:48.302 --> 35:51.852
see here clearly in Sahaja Yoga.

35:51.852 --> 35:56.972
Either he can go upward or he can go downward.

35:58.440 --> 36:06.762
Now see the, how the human awareness has reached
‘adhogati’ – is a downward descent.

36:06.762 --> 36:15.122
Very simple to see if you understand what
Krishna meant that the roots are in the brain?

36:15.868 --> 36:22.672
When I’ve been in the Western countries
I realize it’s much more because they are

36:22.672 --> 36:29.188
supposed to be advanced, developed, sophisticated,
educated,

36:29.213 --> 36:31.803
intellectuals, whatever you may call them.

36:32.184 --> 36:39.829
I’ve been to all Communists countries and
all the democracies and all kinds of isms.

36:40.067 --> 36:48.872
What I realized that exactly what Shri Krishna
had said that asuri vidya will take over.

36:48.872 --> 36:54.195
The descent of awareness is seen clearly in
those countries.

36:54.703 --> 36:57.367
Thank God we are not that advanced.

37:01.510 --> 37:08.003
The descent starts from the Nabhi Chakra as
we call it where a person starts seeking the

37:08.003 --> 37:15.824
food this that and other requirements, then
it starts moving downwards.

37:16.942 --> 37:21.164
The essence of the Nabhi Chakra is ‘Swaha’.

37:21.189 --> 37:24.632
‘Swaha’ is the consumption.

37:24.632 --> 37:29.622
It consumes everything, it aggresses everything,
consumes, just like the fire.

37:29.622 --> 37:34.952
In the same way once upon a time these developed
countries spread all over the world started

37:34.952 --> 37:38.498
consuming everyone.

37:40.362 --> 37:47.493
Ruling our country, China, all kinds of countries,
they went round all over the world.

37:47.802 --> 37:53.186
Thank God Columbus missed his point otherwise
we would not have been here.

37:53.843 --> 38:00.427
He went to America and you cannot find aboriginals
unless and until you enter into

38:00.452 --> 38:04.046
some far fetched places like Peru.

38:06.353 --> 38:12.290
Then the consumption of money on the economic
ground started.

38:13.260 --> 38:20.062
Then the consumption of the Mother Earth started
at the ‘Bhu’ level.

38:22.042 --> 38:25.932
But the ‘Bhurva’ is the ‘Antariksha’
in the whole Universe.

38:25.932 --> 38:30.075
We are going to the Sun, we are going to the
moon, we are going to this,

38:30.100 --> 38:31.502
we are going to that.

38:31.502 --> 38:35.232
What about going inside in the ascent?

38:38.902 --> 38:47.189
Now little bit they are seeing it that there’s
intelligence also plus the energy.

38:47.903 --> 38:52.261
But you are seeing it from the outside.

38:52.286 --> 38:58.026
That’s the intelligence of God Almighty,
whether you like it or not.

38:59.272 --> 39:04.056
So now we are going to the ‘Antarikshas’,
we are going to all these Universes

39:04.081 --> 39:06.167
to find what?

39:08.032 --> 39:15.912
So the ‘Bhurva’ is the essence – the
‘Antariksha’.

39:15.912 --> 39:18.862
Awareness reached there also.

39:20.769 --> 39:25.092
Then it has gone further.

39:25.092 --> 39:32.782
In the Sahaja Yoga we can say that from Nabhi
chakra they started moving downwards towards

39:32.782 --> 39:39.612
the Swadishthana, which deals with the Antariksha,
with the Universes, which was created by the

39:39.612 --> 39:41.922
Creator Brahmadeva.

39:41.922 --> 39:52.793
Below that they moved again, comes the Mooladhara,
which is the essence of human life, which

39:52.793 --> 39:55.602
is the support of human life.

39:55.602 --> 40:01.732
For which Christ Himself has said, “Thou
shall not have adulterous eyes.

40:01.732 --> 40:09.412
” I have yet to find real Christians of
that kind who do not have adulterous eyes.

40:11.566 --> 40:16.683
And that’s why people have gone to now nothing
but they have become sex points,

40:16.708 --> 40:18.763
I can tell you.

40:20.234 --> 40:28.260
The whole awareness of your intellectual movement
has gone to nothing but to this filth

40:28.285 --> 40:30.482
beyond Ganesha.

40:30.482 --> 40:37.102
You have left everything that was holy, that
was auspicious, much behind and crossed, and

40:37.102 --> 40:43.109
one step forward and the hell is there, the
hell.

40:44.412 --> 40:50.087
Where our awareness is going today?

40:51.372 --> 40:56.542
But we have not thought of the ‘urdvagati’
that Shri Krishna has said.

40:56.542 --> 41:03.662
Giving lectures on Shri Krishna, having bhajans
about Shri Krishna, makes no difference.

41:03.662 --> 41:07.362
What about the urdvagati?

41:07.362 --> 41:11.994
In the sixth century a great saint Gyaneshwara
was born.

41:12.019 --> 41:17.412
In the sixth chapter of Gyaneshwari He’s
clearly described, is the Kundalini, which

41:17.412 --> 41:22.672
is going to raise you higher, very clearly,
openly He said it.

41:22.672 --> 41:25.982
Of course as usual everybody tortured His
life.

41:25.982 --> 41:33.103
He didn’t have sometimes water to drink,
that’s different.

41:34.032 --> 41:41.292
In the sixth chapter when He described, even
today in Maharashtra it is said that

41:41.292 --> 41:43.480
sixth chapter is tabooed.

41:43.505 --> 41:47.310
You are not supposed to read the sixth chapter
of Gyaneshwari.

41:51.711 --> 41:53.040
Why?

41:53.198 --> 41:58.975
Because they don’t know a word about Kundalini
and they don’t know how to ascend?

41:59.371 --> 42:04.402
Because it is the knowledge of the roots you
have to go to.

42:05.572 --> 42:15.262
If you are honest please try to understand
that what Shri Krishna has said that the roots

42:15.262 --> 42:26.042
are in the brain and the awareness grows towards
‘adhogati’.

42:26.042 --> 42:32.442
He did not say precisely that Kundalini is
the one that gives you the urdvagati.

42:32.442 --> 42:35.077
He did not say; that was not the time.

42:35.102 --> 42:41.292
At the time of war when He was talking about
Dharma, He did not mention the word Kundalini

42:41.292 --> 42:45.552
doesn’t mean that there was no device behind
it.

42:47.829 --> 42:53.564
Marx   said that we would like to have a country
without State.

42:53.589 --> 42:54.461
How?

42:55.115 --> 42:56.448
How will you have?

42:56.676 --> 43:03.082
I’ve been to most of the Communist countries
I think the state is very powerful.

43:03.082 --> 43:09.382
The democrat said that we would like to have
a free nation.

43:10.326 --> 43:11.604
Free?

43:11.699 --> 43:12.993
Abandonment.

43:13.072 --> 43:16.662
It is demonacracy they are practicing.

43:16.662 --> 43:21.628
If you want to deceive yourself and all the
time, accept something that is falsehood

43:21.653 --> 43:23.622
nobody can help you.

43:23.622 --> 43:31.612
But the time is precarious and is important
that we should see to the truth that the name

43:31.612 --> 43:39.263
of democracy and the name of communism and
the name of capitalism is just a myth.

43:39.540 --> 43:43.912
It has not given what it had promised.

43:43.912 --> 43:58.118
So let us come back to the Saints – to the
deeper people, to the people who understood

43:58.143 --> 44:01.301
life beyond life.

44:02.483 --> 44:12.556
There we find the urdvagati, has to be, the
ascent has to be achieved.

44:13.414 --> 44:16.522
How, is the point?

44:16.522 --> 44:25.941
Then later on Mohammad Saab also has talked
about it, not that He has not talked; He’s

44:25.941 --> 44:28.411
talked about the Resurrection.

44:28.411 --> 44:31.921
He said that at the time of Resurrection your
hands will speak.

44:32.113 --> 44:33.810
Who’s bothered about that?

44:33.835 --> 44:37.691
The whole Namaz is nothing but Kundalini raising.

44:40.554 --> 44:44.806
But it leads to another kind of stupid fanaticism.

44:44.831 --> 44:47.469
Christians are sophisticated fanatics.

44:47.596 --> 44:49.678
Hindus are another type of fanatics.

44:49.703 --> 44:56.441
Everybody is become a fanatic because it’s
all a dead flower.

44:56.441 --> 45:00.791
All these flowers grew on one tree of life.

45:01.884 --> 45:08.360
They’ve been extracted, taken over as mine,
mine, mine and they are all

45:08.385 --> 45:10.152
fighting about it.

45:13.805 --> 45:21.872
So it’s only the Kundalini awakening which
is going to give you your Self-Realization

45:21.872 --> 45:35.259
and this Self-Realization is going to let
you know that you are a part and parcel

45:35.284 --> 45:36.978
of the whole.

45:37.347 --> 45:40.396
It’s not just a mental conception.

45:40.443 --> 45:42.941
This is the point we miss every time.

45:42.941 --> 45:51.644
All these democracies and capitalism and all
these theories are mental projections

45:51.669 --> 45:53.318
of human beings.

45:53.858 --> 46:02.892
All these mental projections are nothing but
your own jails, your own bondages into which

46:02.892 --> 46:04.701
you are caught up.

46:04.944 --> 46:08.570
You have to get out of it.

46:09.461 --> 46:16.982
Even to such an extent that people start saying
that Adishankaracharya did not write

46:17.007 --> 46:18.201
Saundarya Lahiri.

46:18.226 --> 46:19.488
Who says that?

46:19.513 --> 46:21.442
Intellectuals again.

46:23.291 --> 46:25.761
What makes them think that he did not write?

46:25.912 --> 46:28.252
They have explanations for everything.

46:28.277 --> 46:35.145
But he did, which we can prove after Self-Realization.

46:35.691 --> 46:42.982
How all the essence of all the religions are
so much one can be proved only after Self-Realization

46:42.982 --> 46:46.481
and not through discussions.

46:47.032 --> 46:56.832
Because Self – the Spirit, is the absolute
and is the collective being, that is not the

46:56.832 --> 46:58.522
awakened within us.

46:58.522 --> 47:02.041
One may say that why Buddha did not talk of
God?

47:02.041 --> 47:07.091
Because he knew human beings very well and
he said, “No use talking about God, better

47:07.091 --> 47:09.412
talk about Self-Realization”.

47:09.412 --> 47:11.742
Same with Mahavira.

47:11.742 --> 47:14.238
But what are the Buddhists and Mahaviris doing?

47:14.263 --> 47:15.404
God alone knows.

47:15.429 --> 47:17.590
Where are they?

47:20.612 --> 47:30.512
But today is the time as described in the
Puranas many, many seekers are born on Earth.

47:30.512 --> 47:36.221
A special time is a time of real blossom.

47:36.221 --> 47:40.652
Maybe in the olden day there were only one
or two flowers like Nachiketa.

47:40.652 --> 47:48.362
But today is the time when thousands are there
just to become the fruit.

47:48.362 --> 47:58.302
But unfortunately a market has been opened
out where the seekers go and get lost.

47:58.302 --> 48:03.372
Get lost into the convictions and the ideas
of some other person which is gone into their

48:03.372 --> 48:05.502
heads and they just finish off there.

48:05.502 --> 48:12.131
Their seeking finishes off there, they end
up as sick or obstinate people.

48:12.417 --> 48:16.331
They do not want to go any further.

48:19.397 --> 48:26.007
Shri Krishna is to be understood in Sahaja
style.

48:26.032 --> 48:30.022
Leela – He was Leeladhara.

48:30.022 --> 48:39.052
In the Sahaja Yoga we believe that on the
left hand side, the left sympathetic nervous

48:39.052 --> 48:47.162
system is represented by the ‘Ida Nadi’
– which we call as also the ‘Chandra Nadi’

48:47.162 --> 48:56.406
and the right hand side it is represented
by the ‘Pingala Nadi’ – the right sympathetic.

48:57.152 --> 49:03.002
The left we use when we desire.

49:03.002 --> 49:07.132
The right we use when we act.

49:07.132 --> 49:14.281
The left is the ‘bhakti marga’ [path of
devotion] and the right is the ‘karma marga’

49:14.281 --> 49:20.132
[path of action] that they used for doing
all kinds of yagnas and all that.

49:20.132 --> 49:31.312
The central part of ascent is the ‘Sushumna’
is the path of dharma.

49:31.312 --> 49:39.764
‘Dharaiti Sa dharma’ – means the one
that is your sustenance is the Dharma.

49:39.764 --> 49:47.772
It’s not an outside concept but an innate
nature of human beings is the dharma.

49:47.772 --> 49:52.892
This dharma we have achieved through evolutionary
process, as you know ‘matsya rupa’ and

49:52.892 --> 49:54.502
other things took place.

49:54.502 --> 49:57.692
And afterwards we are today human beings.

49:58.818 --> 50:00.653
But why?

50:01.014 --> 50:05.831
Let us ask a question, simple question to
ourselves ‘why are we here on this Earth?

50:07.007 --> 50:09.597
To seek what?

50:09.622 --> 50:14.088
To seek the truth and what is the truth?’

50:14.382 --> 50:19.308
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

50:20.081 --> 50:30.002
Not this bhakti, not this karma.

50:30.002 --> 50:34.431
But you are the Spirit.

50:34.431 --> 50:41.262
Now Shri Krishna’s diplomacy can be seen
very clearly, if you want to see even, even

50:41.262 --> 50:43.172
without Self-Realization.

50:43.252 --> 50:48.502
He says for bhakti [devotion] – “patram”
[leaf], “pushpam” [flower], “phalam”

50:48.502 --> 50:50.362
[fruit], “toyam” [water].

50:50.362 --> 50:54.291
All these things you give it to Him, He’ll
accept.

50:54.291 --> 51:02.522
But see the diplomacy on one word He has played
the whole people and nobody has seen the point.

51:02.522 --> 51:04.519
What does He say?

51:04.544 --> 51:10.520
He says that you have to do ‘ananya bhakti’.

51:10.545 --> 51:14.162
‘Ananya’ shabda [word] itself means, the
word itself means when there is not the other;

51:14.162 --> 51:16.395
means you are a realized soul.

51:16.420 --> 51:21.382
Logically let us see what does it mean?

51:21.382 --> 51:27.081
If there is no connection with God whom are
you praying to?

51:28.413 --> 51:30.722
The connection has to be established.

51:30.755 --> 51:34.601
You may go on describing God as a myth, you
may go on

51:34.626 --> 51:36.732
supporting Him doing anything you like.

51:36.732 --> 51:44.030
But you have not yet been connected with Him
what are you talking?

51:46.242 --> 51:49.061
Something in the air.

51:49.061 --> 51:52.321
‘Ananya bhakti’.

51:52.321 --> 51:55.162
Now about karma, see the diplomacy.

51:55.162 --> 51:59.591
If you keep your mind open as a scientist
you’ll see My point clearly.

51:59.591 --> 52:11.746
For that He says that do your karmas but put
the fruit of your doing

52:11.771 --> 52:14.182
at the Lotus Feet   of the Lord.

52:14.492 --> 52:21.083
This is the absurd condition; is not possible,
cannot be done.

52:21.273 --> 52:24.338
Before Realization you cannot do this.

52:24.363 --> 52:29.032
Many people come to Me, “Yes Mother You
know whatever we are doing, we are putting

52:29.032 --> 52:34.541
at the Lotus Feet of the God” – black
marketing, everything.

52:37.084 --> 52:38.966
What does that mean?

52:39.045 --> 52:46.058
That you put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord,
that you are no more there.

52:46.645 --> 52:55.461
It’s only after Realization you realize,
that a Sahaja Yogi would tell you, he doesn’t

52:55.461 --> 53:01.841
say, “I give him Realization”, he doesn’t
say that, “I am moving his Kundalini.”

53:01.841 --> 53:06.831
” What he says, “It is not moving, It
is not coming up.

53:07.831 --> 53:13.762
There was a lady who traveled with Me to America
once and her son came all the way from Honalulu,

53:13.762 --> 53:17.551
a very rich man and all those things.

53:17.551 --> 53:19.835
So he could not get his Realization.

53:20.137 --> 53:23.362
So she came to Me and said, “Mother, give
him the Realization.”

53:23.389 --> 53:24.572
I said, “You give him.”

53:24.597 --> 53:27.087
She said, “No, no, no I cannot give him.”

53:27.603 --> 53:32.593
So I said, “I can’t give him either, the
Kundalini doesn’t move what to do?

53:32.927 --> 53:36.127
Then give him a false certificate you are
a realized soul.

53:36.152 --> 53:40.236
He can say ‘born again’ or sort of a nonsense
he can go about, talking about.”

53:42.239 --> 53:45.301
She said, “No, no how can you give such
a false certificate?”

53:45.301 --> 53:46.301
I said, “That’s it.

53:46.301 --> 53:53.732
If the Kundalini has not risen if it is not
broken the Brahmarandra we cannot even say

53:53.732 --> 53:57.932
it is awakened, leave alone calling him a
Sahaja Yogi.”

53:58.060 --> 53:59.687
She agreed there.

53:59.712 --> 54:03.262
You cannot give a false certificate about
it.

54:03.262 --> 54:08.181
That’s what happens when you do your karmas.

54:08.181 --> 54:10.482
You don’t say that you are doing it.

54:10.482 --> 54:16.924
It’s done ‘it’ in the third; like small
children always talk like that.

54:17.186 --> 54:21.624
“Mother this boy Munna wont listen, is a
bad one.”

54:21.736 --> 54:25.011
In the third person they talk so many
times you must’ve seen.

54:25.281 --> 54:31.796
In the same way a realized soul always talks
in the third person.

54:33.431 --> 54:39.041
That’s the different world in which they
have lived and they have been very, very few

54:39.104 --> 54:48.288
tortured, and never understood by the people
who were ruling or the people who were the

54:48.313 --> 54:52.352
intellectuals or whose who were the priests.

54:52.352 --> 54:58.143
And the public was helplessly watching all
their tortures.

54:59.722 --> 55:04.022
In Maharashtra we have a great saint called
Namdev.

55:04.022 --> 55:14.301
Very great saint – Namdeva, he was a tailor,
ordinary tailor and when this tailor went

55:14.301 --> 55:23.946
to see another saint whose name was Gorakumbhar
– is a potter.

55:26.580 --> 55:32.099
The words he says is so beautiful which you
can understand

55:32.124 --> 55:36.726
with little subtler feelings about it.

55:37.265 --> 55:44.841
He says, “Nirgunachya bheti aalo sagunashi”
– I came here to meet the nirguna – the

55:44.841 --> 55:49.489
formless and here is standing in the form.

55:49.751 --> 55:53.492
Where do you find these talks these days?

55:53.492 --> 55:59.691
If two great meet they go with swords, with
pistols.

55:59.691 --> 56:11.471
Here he goes and talks to a potter that I
came to see the ‘nirakara’, the ‘nirguna’

56:11.471 --> 56:15.221
– the formless and here it is in the form.

56:15.526 --> 56:17.406
But he was a tailor.

56:17.431 --> 56:21.749
How can be a tailor a realized soul?

56:22.411 --> 56:34.402
And when Namdeva went to Punjab Shri Nanak
Saab gave Him all the honor of a saint and

56:34.402 --> 56:41.252
told Him that He should also write some beautiful
verses because He compiled the Granth Saab

56:41.252 --> 56:51.099
out of all the realized souls poems – that
You compile the poems in Punjabi or Hindi.

56:51.218 --> 56:57.222
Namadeva, coming from such a far-fetched place
He studied Hindi and Punjabi and you’ll

56:57.222 --> 57:05.654
be amazed that half of His book, which is
so big is in Hindi or in Punjabi language.

57:05.686 --> 57:09.652
For that you need Shri Nanaka who can recognize.

57:09.652 --> 57:17.022
But today seekers run after somebody who pampers
their ego, where you can pay some money, where

57:17.022 --> 57:25.222
you can befool you by getting some Rolls Royces
or some sort of a Geeta pravachana [discourse]

57:25.247 --> 57:30.154
he gives or gives you some sort of a name
in the ear so that you become mad.

57:30.622 --> 57:37.102
This is the quality of the seekers, which
I have to face.

57:37.102 --> 57:44.530
Whatever it is, the concern is so great; whatever
is the quality today it has to happen, it

57:44.555 --> 57:46.081
has to work out.

57:46.081 --> 57:55.719
Which one now I heard to My complete surprise
that now people – the intellectuals are

57:55.744 --> 58:03.742
propounding, that the Namadeva who came from
Maharashtra was not the same as the Namadeva

58:03.742 --> 58:10.201
who was a tailor because he was not an intellectual.

58:10.201 --> 58:19.291
I am talking about the unlimited not about
the limited.

58:19.291 --> 58:26.581
Like in any one of your spacecrafts you have
different cylinders, which explode one after

58:26.581 --> 58:32.646
another and accelerate the one, which comes.

58:33.115 --> 58:39.061
First one will explode and accelerate the
second one; the second one will explode and

58:39.061 --> 58:41.081
accelerate the third one.

58:41.081 --> 58:54.122
In the same way the intellect is to be exploded
to go into the space, to jump into the space,

58:54.122 --> 59:02.161
is the most important thing that the intellect
has to leave its limitedness to the unlimited

59:02.161 --> 59:05.701
intelligence, which covers the whole universe.

59:05.701 --> 59:11.035
That is the ‘Brahma Shakti’ described,
that’s the All-Pervading Power of God, that

59:11.060 --> 59:13.450
is the power of love of God.

59:16.484 --> 59:23.312
And is such a tremendous one where Shri Krishna
Himself has said ‘Yogakshema Vahamyaham’.

59:23.312 --> 59:24.312
First He said ‘yoga’.

59:24.312 --> 59:26.761
Why did He not say ‘Kshema Yoga’?

59:27.110 --> 59:33.810
Many people ask Me in the West that how is
it in Your country there’s so much of poverty

59:34.111 --> 59:37.411
and that You talk that it’s a Yoga bhumi?

59:37.411 --> 59:42.210
Because we have not taken to yoga so far.

59:42.235 --> 59:51.919
And Kshema doesn’t mean how may pubs you
have in your village, it doesn’t mean how

59:52.132 --> 59:56.518
many drunkards move about in your village,
it means,

59:56.543 --> 59:59.589
how many saints there are in your country.

59:59.614 --> 01:00:06.756
Let the Yoga come up, you’ll be surprised
this great country of Bharat Bhoomi will one

01:00:06.781 --> 01:00:09.841
day show its merit to the whole world.

01:00:09.841 --> 01:00:20.581
In its reality, in its glory and in its Divinity
which resides in this country.

01:00:20.581 --> 01:00:26.341
You are great people that you are born in
this country but you don’t know, you have

01:00:26.341 --> 01:00:29.622
no idea as to where you are born?

01:00:29.622 --> 01:00:31.843
What is your heritage?

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:37.730
There are people I’ve met very surprisingly
so

01:00:39.781 --> 01:00:54.071
stupefied by Hegle and Kant and all such people
that they believe that all these saints and

01:00:54.071 --> 01:01:03.801
all these great people including Krishna or
Rama, all of them are false.

01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:10.182
This is the height of arrogance and ignorance
both put together because they are ignorant

01:01:10.182 --> 01:01:14.192
one has to forgive them, there’s no way
out.

01:01:14.192 --> 01:01:27.422
God is the ocean of love, ocean of praise,
ocean of wisdom, ocean of this All-Pervading

01:01:27.422 --> 01:01:44.951
Power, which is so efficient, so kind, so
understanding, works out everything so well.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:50.802
But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness
I can tell you.

01:01:50.802 --> 01:01:58.302
I really tell you in My experience, I feel
this forgiveness is so greatly effective today

01:01:58.327 --> 01:02:02.914
otherwise I don’t think I could’ve managed
this job so well.

01:02:02.939 --> 01:02:04.792
May God bless you all.

01:02:04.792 --> 01:02:16.432
As a Mother I’ve try to explain and express
My concern.

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.853
Try to understand.

01:02:17.878 --> 01:02:24.740
It is Sahaja – is born with you, ‘Sahaja’
– ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ – born.

01:02:24.765 --> 01:02:28.912
It’s your fundamental right as a human being
to get your Self-Realization.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:33.422
But if you want to deny it because you have
some convictions because you are following

01:02:33.422 --> 01:02:39.062
certain people, because you think this is
all right we don’t want to have Self-Realization.

01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:42.751
God is not going to fall at your feet.

01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:46.832
You have to ask for it.

01:02:46.832 --> 01:02:50.696
You have to knock at the door and the door
will be opened.

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:59.152
In Sahaja Yoga we can prove today that there’s
no quarrel between Moses and Christ, there

01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:07.799
is no quarrel between Christ and Mohammad
Saab and there is no quarrel between Mohammad

01:03:07.824 --> 01:03:10.023
Saab and Shri Krishna.

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:12.456
They are all one together.

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:17.681
As Christ has clearly said, “Those who are
not against Me are with Me.

01:03:18.011 --> 01:03:19.622
” Who wants to see that?

01:03:20.543 --> 01:03:23.102
Who are those?

01:03:23.102 --> 01:03:30.612
Christ was not even allowed to work out for
more than three and half years.

01:03:30.612 --> 01:03:36.302
It took Me four years to give Realization
to seven English men.

01:03:36.302 --> 01:03:38.939
So you can imagine what must be His plight?

01:03:39.051 --> 01:03:43.812
Three and a half years with all the mad people
around.

01:03:43.812 --> 01:03:45.852
But not in our villages.

01:03:45.852 --> 01:03:52.862
Yesterday I went to Jaipur; first we had a
big meeting in a big sophisticated hall and

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:56.352
all this and this, My Indian English.

01:03:56.352 --> 01:04:02.731
I was trying to explain to them and I thought
it’s all gone over their heads; nothing

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:06.672
went inside or maybe under their feet.

01:04:07.156 --> 01:04:13.072
Then I said, “Let’s go to a place where
ordinary people live.

01:04:13.072 --> 01:04:19.503
And there I found thousands thronging together
to get their Self-Realization.

01:04:19.528 --> 01:04:24.612
They don’t want money, they don’t want
power, they don’t want anything, they don’t

01:04:24.612 --> 01:04:27.731
want any conviction, they want their Self-Realization.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:30.242
“Maa humko atma bodh dijiye.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:31.954
Humko atma gyan.

01:04:32.224 --> 01:04:39.242
” They understand that ‘bodha’ doesn’t
mean lecturing, it doesn’t mean, it means

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:44.845
on your central nervous system you have to
feel the All-Pervading Power – that is ‘bodha’,

01:04:44.893 --> 01:04:47.825
that is the “vidh” which is described
in the Vedas.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:53.524
They understand; they live with the life,
they are natural people.

01:04:53.627 --> 01:04:56.516
They know all this talking is on and on and
on.

01:04:56.549 --> 01:05:02.306
They know something has to happen and the
second thing they said was so encouraging

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:07.087
– “Ke Maa parivartan hona chahiye ham
mein” – we should be transformed.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:11.148
It’s not our mental idea that we have become
some great yogi, this, that.

01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:12.783
We should be transformed.

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:18.716
I said, “Not only transformed but you’ll
have your powers as realized souls”.

01:05:19.121 --> 01:05:27.170
By God’s grace even in Delhi, which is supposed
to be the most sophisticated place where after

01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:30.804
English left we became merry more, much more
westernized;

01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:34.054
when they were here we were better off.

01:05:34.403 --> 01:05:47.231
And in this place also I find there are so
many great Sahaja Yogis who are now completely

01:05:47.256 --> 01:05:55.848
endowed with the power of Realization, of
curing, of doing all the things that can be

01:05:55.873 --> 01:05:59.915
done as a yogi.

01:06:00.471 --> 01:06:07.780
I hope today all of you will get your Realization,
but you have to establish yourself.

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:16.967
It’s just a wee bit of your Kundalini, I
should say like a hair comes out through the

01:06:16.992 --> 01:06:28.621
Brahma Nadi, but with humility, abhyase [practice],
for few days you establish yourself.

01:06:28.646 --> 01:06:32.903
Of course today you might get your ‘nirvichar
samadhi’ [thoughtless awareness] just like

01:06:32.944 --> 01:06:34.164
that, maybe.

01:06:34.189 --> 01:06:38.939
But you’ll have to establish your ‘nirvikalpa’
[doubtless awareness].

01:06:38.964 --> 01:06:43.870
You must give some time to yourself and some
respect to your Self-Realization and to yourself

01:06:43.895 --> 01:06:45.145
[pratigya?

01:06:45.247 --> 01:06:47.951
May God bless you.
