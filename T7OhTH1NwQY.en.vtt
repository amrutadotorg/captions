WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:09.527
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

00:10.827 --> 00:17.727
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

00:18.627 --> 00:23.627
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

00:25.293 --> 00:29.460
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

00:30.460 --> 00:34.560
But also yoga has another meaning which means "yukti".

00:35.360 --> 00:39.460
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

00:39.627 --> 00:46.326
We can call it as - "yukti" means the trick.

00:46.627 --> 00:55.460
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

00:55.560 --> 01:00.693
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.360
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

01:04.627 --> 01:12.293
But one can say, it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

01:12.560 --> 01:18.360
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

01:19.493 --> 01:24.360
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

01:24.827 --> 01:31.360
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

01:32.393 --> 01:39.727
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

01:40.527 --> 01:44.360
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

01:45.793 --> 01:49.393
At Krishna's level when we reach

01:50.360 --> 01:54.360
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

01:55.527 --> 02:01.593
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', means

02:01.627 --> 02:16.360
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

02:17.827 --> 02:25.360
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

02:25.493 --> 02:29.627
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

02:29.827 --> 02:37.360
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

02:39.560 --> 02:48.827
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

02:50.293 --> 02:53.527
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

02:53.727 --> 02:56.860
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

02:57.460 --> 03:00.393
So Shri Krishna had to come -

03:00.860 --> 03:03.860
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

03:04.560 --> 03:13.360
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

03:18.460 --> 03:24.827
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

03:25.693 --> 03:31.360
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

03:32.426 --> 03:35.360
you have electrical communications.

03:35.727 --> 03:40.727
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

03:41.360 --> 03:45.793
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

03:46.426 --> 03:50.360
Supposing only you know all the technique,

03:51.693 --> 03:55.360
then it becomes quite a headache,

03:56.326 --> 03:59.360
because all the time you think you are doing it.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.727
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

04:03.460 --> 04:08.360
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.493
You get tired and bored.

04:12.527 --> 04:19.493
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

04:20.627 --> 04:26.360
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

04:28.493 --> 04:33.360
And that is what is 'Leela', that's why He is called as 'Leeladhara' -

04:33.593 --> 04:40.360
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

04:40.360 --> 04:49.360
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

04:52.560 --> 05:02.360
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

05:03.827 --> 05:09.627
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

05:10.360 --> 05:16.360
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

05:17.493 --> 05:23.360
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.793
In the morning you get up.

05:29.426 --> 05:35.627
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

05:36.527 --> 05:41.693
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

05:42.393 --> 05:47.360
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

05:49.326 --> 05:53.326
And at that time you sit down for your dhyan.

05:53.493 --> 06:01.326
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

06:03.593 --> 06:06.593
But for that you have to be a master.

06:08.360 --> 06:13.360
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.627
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

06:16.793 --> 06:22.360
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

06:23.460 --> 06:28.360
so that it becomes your play.

06:30.560 --> 06:38.360
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

06:40.426 --> 06:47.593
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.593
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

06:52.326 --> 06:57.760
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

06:58.860 --> 07:03.360
It looks, very childlike.

07:03.827 --> 07:10.360
Like when the gopis were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

07:10.627 --> 07:13.793
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

07:14.627 --> 07:19.326
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

07:19.326 --> 07:23.360
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

07:25.293 --> 07:30.293
He is sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

07:31.527 --> 07:37.360
They are coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.360
Already there are vibrations here, see - raising their Kundalini.

07:45.293 --> 07:53.426
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

07:53.693 --> 07:57.293
which have also got vibrated water in.

07:58.426 --> 08:02.426
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

08:03.560 --> 08:07.560
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

08:07.793 --> 08:11.760
See the play of a child,

08:12.560 --> 08:19.360
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

08:20.560 --> 08:28.360
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

08:29.827 --> 08:34.793
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

08:37.660 --> 08:40.593
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra'-'dha' .

08:40.627 --> 08:44.560
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.793
So, "Dharayati sa dharma-ha"  as they say,

08:49.360 --> 08:54.360
in the same way, 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

08:55.527 --> 09:01.660
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

09:02.393 --> 09:06.527
There is no word. I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

09:07.827 --> 09:13.593
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

09:14.593 --> 09:16.593
Just feel very happy.

09:16.660 --> 09:19.360
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

09:19.360 --> 09:28.360
for joy or at the most happiness.

09:29.426 --> 09:32.426
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

09:32.627 --> 09:38.360
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

09:38.426 --> 09:41.360
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.360
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

09:44.593 --> 09:51.627
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

09:52.360 --> 09:55.426
to all the people with whom He was connected.

09:55.793 --> 10:01.360
So all the gop and gopis who were with Him had to do Ras.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.360
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

10:04.593 --> 10:08.326
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.493
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

10:13.760 --> 10:18.527
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

10:18.593 --> 10:22.360
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

10:23.693 --> 10:27.293
So this was another play that He had.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.360
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.560
But in modern times it's very difficult,

10:39.660 --> 10:44.326
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

10:44.660 --> 10:52.627
I mean, nobody will understand also.

10:55.527 --> 11:02.360
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

11:02.493 --> 11:05.693
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

11:06.393 --> 11:10.527
and also empowering the person with

11:10.827 --> 11:15.660
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.860
And that's why we had to find out these methods

11:20.360 --> 11:24.360
by which we could give realization to people.

11:26.793 --> 11:33.326
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.360
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

11:36.360 --> 11:40.326
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

11:40.560 --> 11:47.360
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

11:47.360 --> 11:53.627
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

11:53.627 --> 11:57.660
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

11:59.326 --> 12:06.493
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

12:07.426 --> 12:15.426
The first is that His character was 'madhurya', meaning the sweetness.

12:16.727 --> 12:23.360
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

12:25.727 --> 12:32.360
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

12:33.560 --> 12:42.360
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

12:43.460 --> 12:49.360
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

12:50.693 --> 12:56.693
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

12:59.660 --> 13:03.326
Everything is madhurya for Him, His talking,

13:03.360 --> 13:11.360
His actions, His face. Everything is madhurya.

13:12.793 --> 13:18.360
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

13:18.360 --> 13:21.560
the communication between human beings

13:22.460 --> 13:27.460
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

13:27.727 --> 13:32.360
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

13:33.560 --> 13:35.560
which is not true.

13:37.593 --> 13:41.627
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

13:43.393 --> 13:49.360
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

13:49.360 --> 13:53.527
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

13:55.560 --> 14:01.293
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

14:01.627 --> 14:07.360
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

14:08.627 --> 14:15.360
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

14:15.560 --> 14:19.560
that trick one has to learn:

14:23.793 --> 14:27.793
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.627
This is one of His special qualities,

14:32.460 --> 14:38.693
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

14:39.293 --> 14:43.360
in a very sweet manner, and

14:45.560 --> 14:52.593
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.360
Now there are many tricks

14:56.827 --> 15:03.360
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

15:05.326 --> 15:07.560
First of all, you must always show

15:07.593 --> 15:11.360
that you are less intelligent than another person.

15:16.593 --> 15:19.593
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

15:20.360 --> 15:23.360
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know;

15:24.527 --> 15:31.360
no good for a scientist." So they feel "ah, very good."

15:38.693 --> 15:43.693
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

15:44.627 --> 15:50.360
No, I just have learnt a little bit, but not much."

15:51.693 --> 15:53.693
Musician feels very happy.

15:53.727 --> 15:58.360
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

15:59.360 --> 16:05.360
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

16:08.360 --> 16:14.360
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

16:16.360 --> 16:20.560
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

16:20.627 --> 16:26.360
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

16:29.627 --> 16:36.760
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

16:38.560 --> 16:42.360
but I would like to hear" this is first.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.693
The first quality of communication is to be

16:46.693 --> 16:48.693
extremely humble about yourself.

16:49.360 --> 16:53.360
The other person should not know who you are.

16:55.693 --> 16:59.360
And there's a lot of fun in it.

17:00.360 --> 17:06.393
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

17:07.593 --> 17:10.693
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

17:11.360 --> 17:16.360
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

17:16.560 --> 17:21.360
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

17:21.527 --> 17:23.360
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

17:23.360 --> 17:27.293
just a useless, small, little place

17:27.326 --> 17:30.360
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

17:30.360 --> 17:34.527
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.527
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

17:36.560 --> 17:40.527
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

17:40.760 --> 17:48.426
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

17:48.527 --> 17:51.360
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

17:51.560 --> 17:55.493
She was shocked!, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

17:55.593 --> 17:59.326
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

17:59.493 --> 18:01.593
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.360
She had started looking down upon Me,

18:04.360 --> 18:07.360
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

18:12.527 --> 18:20.360
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

18:21.527 --> 18:23.493
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

18:23.527 --> 18:28.360
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

18:28.693 --> 18:31.360
This boastfullness is of no use.

18:31.827 --> 18:35.860
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

18:35.860 --> 18:39.360
But if you want I can try."

18:44.627 --> 18:53.727
So, is to play down as much as you can. Practice this at home.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.360
First, practice and then do it.

18:59.460 --> 19:05.293
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

19:08.393 --> 19:11.393
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

19:11.460 --> 19:12.627
there's one is very important thing,

19:12.627 --> 19:15.460
It says "Krodhat bhavati sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

19:15.627 --> 19:20.460
You see among all the worst things that we have -

19:20.493 --> 19:25.360
according to Him we have six enemies.

19:27.793 --> 19:31.493
But in Gita He started with 'Krodh'.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.360
He said - it starts with krodh, means anger.

19:37.860 --> 19:43.727
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

19:44.727 --> 19:50.360
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.527
He can make you dance like this.

19:54.393 --> 19:57.360
What is the need to lose your temper?

19:58.693 --> 20:02.693
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

20:03.527 --> 20:07.727
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

20:08.360 --> 20:12.693
and something starts barking,

20:15.360 --> 20:18.527
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

20:18.760 --> 20:25.293
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

20:27.760 --> 20:32.793
He has started with krodha, that: with the krodha all problems start.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.360
from one to another to another to another.

20:36.493 --> 20:40.693
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

20:44.527 --> 20:51.660
Anger comes from Vishuddhi, starts from liver - Vishnu -

20:52.326 --> 20:54.460
but expressed through Vishuddhi.

20:54.860 --> 20:58.360
Face becomes red, eyes become red.

20:58.693 --> 21:03.593
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

21:04.360 --> 21:08.793
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

21:09.527 --> 21:15.360
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

21:15.793 --> 21:18.493
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

21:18.693 --> 21:23.760
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.360
Many people I have seen people say

21:26.360 --> 21:28.627
"Mother, do you know, this lady is such a hot-tempered women,

21:28.627 --> 21:31.727
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

21:32.360 --> 21:34.560
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.627
No, no I'm very good."

21:37.627 --> 21:43.360
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

21:44.426 --> 21:47.360
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

21:47.793 --> 21:54.360
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

21:54.360 --> 21:57.360
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.360
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

22:01.360 --> 22:05.527
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.560
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

22:11.793 --> 22:19.693
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.360
There is no need to take to temper.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.527
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

22:26.360 --> 22:27.860
Why are you doing that way?"

22:28.326 --> 22:31.360
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

22:31.360 --> 22:33.360
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

22:33.360 --> 22:40.360
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

22:40.360 --> 22:45.360
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

22:48.827 --> 22:52.627
If you just stop at a point,

22:55.360 --> 22:59.360
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

22:59.460 --> 23:02.627
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

23:02.860 --> 23:06.360
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.360
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

23:10.627 --> 23:14.627
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

23:14.860 --> 23:19.760
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

23:20.360 --> 23:24.360
you feel very bad - "Why I said so? I should not have said this."

23:25.793 --> 23:31.460
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

23:32.360 --> 23:35.827
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

23:36.293 --> 23:40.493
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

23:41.493 --> 23:44.460
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

23:46.360 --> 23:52.293
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

23:52.860 --> 23:57.360
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

23:58.793 --> 24:01.360
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

24:01.360 --> 24:04.360
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

24:08.593 --> 24:12.527
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

24:13.760 --> 24:15.760
you'll never feel guilty.

24:16.293 --> 24:19.360
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

24:19.627 --> 24:22.293
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

24:23.593 --> 24:26.560
Next time you won't do it.

24:27.793 --> 24:31.693
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

24:32.460 --> 24:38.693
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

24:40.326 --> 24:41.360
And I'm very much worried about

24:41.360 --> 24:46.360
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

24:47.493 --> 24:51.660
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

24:52.393 --> 24:57.360
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

24:58.793 --> 25:04.426
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

25:04.560 --> 25:08.326
and when you touch them it becomes water.

25:10.393 --> 25:15.627
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

25:16.360 --> 25:19.593
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

25:19.760 --> 25:25.360
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

25:28.627 --> 25:30.793
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.827
But women don't, they keep it there

25:34.360 --> 25:38.693
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

25:38.860 --> 25:43.827
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

25:44.527 --> 25:48.426
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

25:48.560 --> 25:52.360
but it's tears just to impress another person that

25:52.360 --> 25:55.360
you are very sad or something.

26:05.627 --> 26:11.393
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

26:11.727 --> 26:15.360
and the third one is how to master

26:15.360 --> 26:22.360
the temper of others - that's even better.

26:24.793 --> 26:27.293
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

26:27.360 --> 26:30.360
Gagangadh Maharaj, when I went to him.

26:31.493 --> 26:34.293
He is a very hot-tempered avadhuta, sitting on

26:34.293 --> 26:36.360
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

26:36.527 --> 26:38.360
so he was sitting in the water

26:38.360 --> 26:43.727
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

26:43.793 --> 26:46.293
I never saw the tiger, of course.

26:46.326 --> 26:49.593
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

26:49.627 --> 26:51.593
so I went to see him.

26:51.793 --> 26:57.360
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

26:57.360 --> 27:00.393
for about one and a half hours,

27:00.760 --> 27:04.326
and as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

27:04.326 --> 27:07.593
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

27:08.527 --> 27:10.493
so he felt very challenged!

27:10.693 --> 27:14.627
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

27:14.760 --> 27:16.360
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

27:16.360 --> 27:21.393
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

27:21.460 --> 27:25.793
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

27:28.326 --> 27:30.360
He touched My feet, everything he did and then he said,

27:30.360 --> 27:34.360
"You tell me now - why did You not allow me to stop the water?

27:34.360 --> 27:39.627
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know,

27:40.693 --> 27:44.426
but why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

27:44.627 --> 27:49.326
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

27:52.393 --> 27:57.527
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

27:58.360 --> 28:02.693
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

28:03.393 --> 28:05.326
that too of an orange colour, and I would

28:05.393 --> 28:07.693
not take the orange colour sari from you.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.660
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.360
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

28:14.560 --> 28:22.360
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master!

28:25.827 --> 28:33.827
First of all how to melt him, and secondly the master of his mind.

28:35.360 --> 28:41.560
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.627
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

28:46.493 --> 28:50.760
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.360
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

28:54.360 --> 28:58.627
But if you try just to know about a person -

28:59.460 --> 29:03.360
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

29:03.627 --> 29:07.360
So first try to understand a person.

29:09.627 --> 29:12.627
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

29:13.426 --> 29:16.460
and a very humorous person.

29:17.627 --> 29:20.360
And one day My brother told Me, Babamama,

29:20.360 --> 29:23.360
that he has a friend who sings very well.

29:24.393 --> 29:26.560
So I asked My father "How does he sing?"

29:26.660 --> 29:30.727
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

29:31.360 --> 29:34.493
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

29:35.360 --> 29:40.293
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

29:40.493 --> 29:41.793
"He's very courageous you see.

29:42.326 --> 29:44.793
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

29:45.426 --> 29:48.860
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.627
he said "He's courageous" -

29:50.727 --> 29:53.360
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

29:53.360 --> 29:56.527
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

29:56.560 --> 30:00.360
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

30:00.693 --> 30:05.360
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

30:08.360 --> 30:13.360
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

30:14.326 --> 30:16.360
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

30:16.360 --> 30:20.360
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

30:20.493 --> 30:24.360
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

30:28.360 --> 30:33.360
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

30:33.360 --> 30:35.360
with all his qualities, with everything

30:35.360 --> 30:39.360
and accepting that person as he is.

30:41.293 --> 30:43.560
If that mastery you can have.

30:44.326 --> 30:48.393
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

30:48.493 --> 30:52.426
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

30:54.426 --> 30:59.460
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

30:59.460 --> 31:04.460
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

31:05.360 --> 31:09.560
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

31:10.393 --> 31:16.560
Little additional svara (musical note) is added to his character.

31:17.493 --> 31:22.560
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You will really enjoy.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.660
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

31:27.326 --> 31:29.527
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.493
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.793
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

31:35.326 --> 31:41.360
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

31:41.827 --> 31:47.827
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

31:48.560 --> 31:54.360
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

31:54.560 --> 31:56.827
or the defects of that person.

31:57.860 --> 32:00.894
But you need not say directly something to him.

32:03.560 --> 32:08.693
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

32:09.693 --> 32:11.693
that the person will understand.

32:12.460 --> 32:20.460
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

32:22.393 --> 32:27.527
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

32:27.593 --> 32:29.860
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

32:30.693 --> 32:34.894
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

32:35.426 --> 32:40.560
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

32:40.827 --> 32:44.894
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

32:45.760 --> 32:53.393
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.593
that's no good.

32:55.693 --> 33:00.360
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

33:00.560 --> 33:02.627
but you are lost forever for that person.

33:02.860 --> 33:06.360
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

33:06.660 --> 33:11.693
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

33:11.927 --> 33:16.360
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

33:16.360 --> 33:18.627
that it doesn't hurt the person,

33:20.293 --> 33:27.360
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

33:27.527 --> 33:31.360
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

33:33.894 --> 33:44.360
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

33:44.860 --> 33:47.693
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

33:47.793 --> 33:54.393
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

33:54.927 --> 33:58.527
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

33:58.560 --> 34:02.960
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

34:04.426 --> 34:07.527
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

34:07.660 --> 34:15.360
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

34:15.860 --> 34:18.493
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

34:18.560 --> 34:21.527
For example, if you want to say that:

34:21.560 --> 34:24.426
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

34:24.660 --> 34:27.527
should be there at the right time.

34:27.793 --> 34:29.593
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

34:29.693 --> 34:32.894
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

34:33.360 --> 34:35.627
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

34:35.827 --> 34:39.360
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

34:40.693 --> 34:44.293
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

34:44.326 --> 34:47.527
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

34:48.593 --> 34:52.460
for the time being. So transfer it.

34:52.894 --> 34:59.560
And this transference is 'hastaantar' as they call it.

34:59.727 --> 35:06.493
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

35:09.460 --> 35:11.360
There is a story about Him

35:11.460 --> 35:16.360
when He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

35:16.660 --> 35:20.493
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

35:21.326 --> 35:25.693
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

35:25.760 --> 35:30.593
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

35:30.860 --> 35:34.360
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

35:34.360 --> 35:37.360
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.827
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

35:43.627 --> 35:48.560
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

35:48.793 --> 35:55.293
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

35:55.493 --> 36:01.360
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

36:01.360 --> 36:03.393
and if I open my eyes

36:03.760 --> 36:09.393
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma"

36:11.360 --> 36:15.793
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

36:16.627 --> 36:20.593
So He started running away from the field.

36:20.727 --> 36:23.593
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

36:23.927 --> 36:31.627
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

36:31.894 --> 36:38.360
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

36:39.360 --> 36:43.360
and hid himself in the cave.

36:44.326 --> 36:47.693
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

36:47.894 --> 36:50.460
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.593
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

36:53.760 --> 36:56.326
And he started waking [him] up.

36:56.527 --> 37:01.693
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

37:02.727 --> 37:10.393
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

37:12.660 --> 37:17.894
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

37:18.460 --> 37:21.894
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

37:22.493 --> 37:26.693
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

37:27.493 --> 37:32.927
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

37:33.660 --> 37:37.393
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

37:37.560 --> 37:42.493
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

37:42.727 --> 37:47.560
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

37:49.927 --> 37:52.927
And so many tricks He played.

37:58.827 --> 38:06.727
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

38:07.393 --> 38:14.360
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

38:17.493 --> 38:27.560
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

38:28.960 --> 38:34.360
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

38:34.894 --> 38:36.693
He told Arjuna not himself;

38:36.827 --> 38:43.360
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - sarathya.

38:43.793 --> 38:51.793
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

38:52.560 --> 38:58.293
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

38:59.860 --> 39:10.693
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

39:11.493 --> 39:16.660
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

39:17.593 --> 39:25.693
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

39:26.293 --> 39:29.560
How are you going to save there?

39:31.894 --> 39:36.460
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

39:36.660 --> 39:39.793
while Arjuna was his disciple.

39:40.894 --> 40:06.727
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

40:07.326 --> 40:10.660
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

40:10.894 --> 40:19.927
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

40:20.527 --> 40:24.827
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

40:25.360 --> 40:29.360
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

40:29.360 --> 40:35.527
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.426
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

40:41.460 --> 40:49.426
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

40:51.426 --> 40:55.560
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

40:56.827 --> 41:02.493
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

41:02.727 --> 41:04.693
To get rid of the ill -

41:04.860 --> 41:08.527
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

41:08.527 --> 41:13.493
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

41:14.560 --> 41:18.393
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

41:18.460 --> 41:24.393
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

41:25.326 --> 41:27.426
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

41:28.793 --> 41:31.894
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

41:32.493 --> 41:38.627
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

41:38.894 --> 41:44.326
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

41:44.827 --> 41:49.326
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

41:49.727 --> 41:53.960
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

41:54.460 --> 41:59.560
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

41:59.660 --> 42:06.560
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.793
Without weapons also He can do everything.

42:09.693 --> 42:15.360
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

42:16.693 --> 42:24.360
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

42:26.293 --> 42:28.560
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

42:29.393 --> 42:33.293
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

42:33.560 --> 42:35.527
because I don't want them to see.

42:35.727 --> 42:40.460
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

42:40.760 --> 42:44.360
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

42:44.927 --> 42:47.426
and you know what they are playing with you.

42:47.627 --> 42:52.894
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

42:53.293 --> 42:57.693
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

42:59.360 --> 43:03.527
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

43:04.460 --> 43:07.593
will improve very much with others.

43:08.560 --> 43:12.793
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

43:13.393 --> 43:19.527
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

43:20.593 --> 43:22.460
What is bhootish?"

43:22.660 --> 43:26.493
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

43:26.693 --> 43:31.326
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

43:31.360 --> 43:34.660
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

43:36.593 --> 43:41.627
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

43:42.360 --> 43:46.360
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

43:46.493 --> 43:50.393
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

43:50.760 --> 43:54.527
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

43:55.360 --> 43:57.293
then it's even more important.

43:57.527 --> 44:00.493
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

44:00.527 --> 44:02.360
We'll have to take it out."

44:02.860 --> 44:07.593
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

44:07.627 --> 44:11.894
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

44:12.360 --> 44:14.693
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

44:15.360 --> 44:17.560
because you know he is cunning.

44:18.426 --> 44:19.960
What's the use of playing with that?

44:20.660 --> 44:22.793
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

44:22.860 --> 44:27.360
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

44:29.326 --> 44:35.426
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

44:35.860 --> 44:37.627
Not the whole world.

44:39.460 --> 44:43.560
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

44:43.660 --> 44:49.760
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

44:50.493 --> 44:52.593
It's not meant for ordinary people.

44:53.426 --> 44:58.360
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

44:58.493 --> 45:02.693
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

45:03.393 --> 45:06.560
and we find that they create problems for us.

45:08.660 --> 45:12.393
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

45:12.560 --> 45:15.627
as Shri Krishna dealt with gopas and gopis;

45:16.693 --> 45:21.693
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

45:22.460 --> 45:28.760
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

45:29.927 --> 45:33.927
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

45:34.660 --> 45:37.693
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

45:38.627 --> 45:42.593
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

45:45.326 --> 45:48.460
And He did it because He was such a master.

45:49.593 --> 45:53.894
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

45:54.326 --> 45:56.560
to master himself, because He knew himself,

45:56.727 --> 46:00.760
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

46:01.894 --> 46:03.593
When you know everything

46:03.693 --> 46:06.693
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

46:07.360 --> 46:11.560
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

46:14.960 --> 46:22.360
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

46:22.593 --> 46:26.894
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

46:27.960 --> 46:32.360
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

46:34.360 --> 46:39.727
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

46:41.393 --> 46:45.793
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

46:46.593 --> 46:48.894
As I must have told you so many examples

46:49.426 --> 46:51.393
that the western negativity is like this

46:51.393 --> 46:55.760
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

46:57.593 --> 47:00.660
They don't like to work anyway.

47:00.827 --> 47:08.527
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

47:08.894 --> 47:12.360
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

47:12.527 --> 47:17.627
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

47:17.860 --> 47:21.693
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

47:22.627 --> 47:27.693
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

47:28.727 --> 47:33.360
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

47:33.527 --> 47:37.660
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

47:38.293 --> 47:41.393
Except for your brain everything works.

47:42.660 --> 47:44.793
But the other way around it is:

47:45.527 --> 47:49.393
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

47:49.693 --> 47:53.560
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

47:54.393 --> 47:59.660
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

48:01.293 --> 48:03.560
I must do something."

48:04.426 --> 48:07.527
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

48:07.760 --> 48:13.627
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

48:14.727 --> 48:17.360
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

48:17.426 --> 48:19.560
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

48:20.360 --> 48:21.927
if that is not available do this.

48:22.493 --> 48:25.894
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

48:26.860 --> 48:32.627
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

48:32.960 --> 48:35.760
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

48:36.360 --> 48:40.360
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

48:40.894 --> 48:43.360
the Master of Masters we should say.

48:43.593 --> 48:50.360
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

48:51.393 --> 48:52.927
She thought of Shri Krishna.

48:53.393 --> 48:58.727
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

48:58.894 --> 49:01.393
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

49:01.560 --> 49:04.693
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

49:05.326 --> 49:07.360
So She was holding on.

49:07.727 --> 49:10.527
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

49:11.560 --> 49:18.426
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

49:21.360 --> 49:27.527
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

49:27.693 --> 49:33.360
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

49:34.793 --> 49:39.460
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

49:39.560 --> 49:43.727
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

49:44.560 --> 49:53.693
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

49:55.293 --> 49:58.393
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

49:58.627 --> 50:02.393
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

50:02.593 --> 50:08.360
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

50:08.760 --> 50:11.793
to save the chastity of His sister -

50:12.560 --> 50:17.527
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

50:17.793 --> 50:22.727
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

50:24.960 --> 50:30.660
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

50:30.760 --> 50:32.593
which are too many!

50:32.927 --> 50:38.860
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

50:39.493 --> 50:42.560
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

50:42.660 --> 50:44.793
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

50:45.360 --> 50:48.860
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

50:52.593 --> 50:58.326
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

50:58.360 --> 51:03.627
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

51:04.960 --> 51:09.293
But if you believe in yourself

51:09.727 --> 51:16.760
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

51:17.693 --> 51:23.360
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

51:24.894 --> 51:30.860
then I'm sure you can become masters.

51:31.460 --> 51:35.393
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

51:36.593 --> 51:39.560
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

51:40.360 --> 51:43.560
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

51:43.660 --> 51:47.360
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

51:47.527 --> 51:49.393
Nobody has been to university.

51:53.660 --> 51:56.660
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

51:56.827 --> 51:59.460
Krishna never went into university,

51:59.560 --> 52:04.326
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

52:05.360 --> 52:09.527
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

52:09.927 --> 52:12.560
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

52:12.660 --> 52:16.360
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

52:18.094 --> 52:21.326
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

52:21.360 --> 52:25.426
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

52:25.760 --> 52:27.527
what will it look like?

52:27.960 --> 52:30.860
But it's not that you dominate

52:31.393 --> 52:36.360
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

52:38.060 --> 52:41.593
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.426
This is the mastery you have to get.

52:44.693 --> 52:48.960
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.727
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

52:51.760 --> 52:54.360
is that we have to master ourselves.

52:55.293 --> 52:57.094
But then immediately people say

52:57.460 --> 53:02.493
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

53:04.593 --> 53:06.593
I can't understand this.

53:07.727 --> 53:12.360
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

53:13.727 --> 53:18.660
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

53:19.094 --> 53:24.894
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

53:25.027 --> 53:27.360
why can't you correct your own property?

53:28.793 --> 53:30.360
It should be the easiest thing to do

53:30.393 --> 53:33.460
but you're not sure that this is your own,

53:33.727 --> 53:37.393
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

53:37.693 --> 53:41.894
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

53:43.326 --> 53:47.027
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

53:47.326 --> 53:53.360
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

53:55.426 --> 53:57.994
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

53:58.360 --> 54:01.527
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

54:02.860 --> 54:09.293
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

54:09.760 --> 54:13.727
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

54:14.027 --> 54:16.994
This is happening? Put it that way.

54:17.627 --> 54:22.360
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

54:22.360 --> 54:25.760
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

54:28.760 --> 54:31.827
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

54:32.326 --> 54:35.593
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

54:35.860 --> 54:40.760
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

54:40.793 --> 54:43.693
the whole world, to emancipate them.

54:43.827 --> 54:46.660
To bring them out of their ignorance.

54:47.060 --> 54:50.393
So for that we have to develop this mastery

54:52.727 --> 54:55.727
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

54:56.360 --> 54:58.360
but this mastery has to be developed.

54:58.360 --> 55:02.493
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

55:03.360 --> 55:07.360
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

55:08.360 --> 55:11.393
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

55:11.727 --> 55:17.360
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

55:19.493 --> 55:22.360
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

55:22.426 --> 55:28.927
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

55:29.360 --> 55:33.593
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

55:33.827 --> 55:37.360
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

55:40.326 --> 55:42.994
And the last, but not the least,

55:43.660 --> 55:52.393
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

55:53.693 --> 56:02.360
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.693
In these three forms you should see yourself.

56:07.027 --> 56:13.060
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

56:13.560 --> 56:16.527
how I'm acting here!"

56:16.960 --> 56:19.660
Then you become the spectator also.

56:20.094 --> 56:23.360
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

56:23.994 --> 56:28.426
then you will realize what you are doing,

56:29.326 --> 56:31.994
how you are working out everything.

56:32.860 --> 56:38.360
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

56:39.326 --> 56:40.860
will just run away.

56:41.360 --> 56:45.360
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

56:45.760 --> 56:49.360
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

56:49.460 --> 56:54.360
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

56:57.460 --> 57:01.360
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

57:01.827 --> 57:03.760
"let me face it."

57:04.360 --> 57:08.060
But also there is another way out, people find out.

57:08.360 --> 57:10.060
I mean, there are ways and ways.

57:10.493 --> 57:14.326
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

57:14.360 --> 57:16.693
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

57:17.527 --> 57:20.627
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

57:20.894 --> 57:24.360
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

57:26.827 --> 57:29.693
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

57:29.760 --> 57:32.527
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

57:32.793 --> 57:38.727
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

57:38.860 --> 57:42.527
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

57:42.693 --> 57:44.693
So what next?

57:45.460 --> 57:48.627
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

57:49.027 --> 57:52.293
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

57:52.426 --> 57:57.027
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

57:57.326 --> 58:02.960
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

58:03.393 --> 58:05.994
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

58:06.293 --> 58:12.360
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

58:12.994 --> 58:18.593
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

58:18.994 --> 58:23.660
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

58:26.627 --> 58:32.660
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

58:33.894 --> 58:38.360
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

58:38.527 --> 58:43.693
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

58:44.094 --> 58:45.660
you can correct yourself.

58:45.860 --> 58:51.627
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

58:52.094 --> 58:55.860
and you are so detached that you can see it.

58:56.360 --> 59:04.460
The attachment to all the things are finished

59:04.793 --> 59:09.460
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

59:09.527 --> 59:12.927
and acting on these attachments also.

59:13.593 --> 59:21.493
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

59:21.727 --> 59:24.860
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

59:25.293 --> 59:27.860
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

59:28.460 --> 59:30.360
It's the other way around.

59:30.527 --> 59:33.727
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

59:33.894 --> 59:37.360
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

59:38.326 --> 59:43.527
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

59:43.593 --> 59:48.426
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

59:48.460 --> 59:51.493
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

59:53.460 --> 59:57.593
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

59:57.627 --> 59:59.960
I'm talking at the time of peace.

01:00:00.894 --> 01:00:06.293
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.827
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

01:00:09.894 --> 01:00:13.460
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:18.960
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.360
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

01:00:22.593 --> 01:00:24.360
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:26.560
but you are part and parcel of it.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.727
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:36.960
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

01:00:37.727 --> 01:00:42.027
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.960
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.460
and be one with the body of the Virata.

01:00:52.593 --> 01:00:55.560
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

01:00:55.827 --> 01:01:00.860
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

01:01:01.493 --> 01:01:05.027
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

01:01:05.627 --> 01:01:12.060
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.527
that you should have for all the other people

01:01:16.527 --> 01:01:17.994
and immediately they'll recognize.

01:01:18.293 --> 01:01:21.360
I have seen small children are like that.

01:01:21.894 --> 01:01:24.527
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.527
They see their parents and this and that.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.560
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

01:01:32.627 --> 01:01:35.627
after all God is there to look after."

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:43.293
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

01:01:43.393 --> 01:01:45.360
they will neutralize the whole thing.

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:48.360
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.360
from all the little babies that we have

01:01:51.493 --> 01:01:58.360
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.994
with innocence we should work it out.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.027
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

01:02:05.627 --> 01:02:09.460
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.960
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

01:02:13.293 --> 01:02:17.360
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

01:02:17.493 --> 01:02:20.527
May God bless you.
