00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.527
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:17.727
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:23.627
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:29.460
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.560
But also yoga has another meaning which means "yukti".

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.460
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:46.326
We can call it as - "yukti" means the trick.

00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:55.460
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.693
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.360
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:12.293
But one can say, it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.360
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:24.360
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:31.360
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:39.727
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

00:01:40.527 --> 00:01:44.360
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:49.393
At Krishna's level when we reach

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.360
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

00:01:55.527 --> 00:02:01.593
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', means

00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:16.360
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:25.360
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:29.627
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:37.360
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.827
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:53.527
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

00:02:53.727 --> 00:02:56.860
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.393
So Shri Krishna had to come -

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.860
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.360
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.827
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:31.360
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:35.360
you have electrical communications.

00:03:35.727 --> 00:03:40.727
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.793
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:50.360
Supposing only you know all the technique,

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:55.360
then it becomes quite a headache,

00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:59.360
because all the time you think you are doing it.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.727
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.360
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.493
You get tired and bored.

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:19.493
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:26.360
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

00:04:28.493 --> 00:04:33.360
And that is what is 'Leela', that's why He is called as 'Leeladhara' -

00:04:33.593 --> 00:04:40.360
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:49.360
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:02.360
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

00:05:03.827 --> 00:05:09.627
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.360
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

00:05:17.493 --> 00:05:23.360
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.793
In the morning you get up.

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:35.627
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:41.693
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:47.360
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:53.326
And at that time you sit down for your dhyan.

00:05:53.493 --> 00:06:01.326
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:06.593
But for that you have to be a master.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.360
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.627
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:22.360
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.360
so that it becomes your play.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:38.360
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:47.593
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.593
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

00:06:52.326 --> 00:06:57.760
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.360
It looks, very childlike.

00:07:03.827 --> 00:07:10.360
Like when the gopis were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

00:07:10.627 --> 00:07:13.793
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:19.326
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:23.360
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

00:07:25.293 --> 00:07:30.293
He is sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

00:07:31.527 --> 00:07:37.360
They are coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.360
Already there are vibrations here, see - raising their Kundalini.

00:07:45.293 --> 00:07:53.426
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

00:07:53.693 --> 00:07:57.293
which have also got vibrated water in.

00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:02.426
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.560
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

00:08:07.793 --> 00:08:11.760
See the play of a child,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.360
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:28.360
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

00:08:29.827 --> 00:08:34.793
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.593
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra'-'dha' .

00:08:40.627 --> 00:08:44.560
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.793
So, "Dharayati sa dharma-ha"  as they say,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.360
in the same way, 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

00:08:55.527 --> 00:09:01.660
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:06.527
There is no word. I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

00:09:07.827 --> 00:09:13.593
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

00:09:14.593 --> 00:09:16.593
Just feel very happy.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.360
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:28.360
for joy or at the most happiness.

00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:32.426
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

00:09:32.627 --> 00:09:38.360
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:41.360
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.360
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

00:09:44.593 --> 00:09:51.627
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.426
to all the people with whom He was connected.

00:09:55.793 --> 00:10:01.360
So all the gop and gopis who were with Him had to do Ras.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.360
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

00:10:04.593 --> 00:10:08.326
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.493
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.527
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

00:10:18.593 --> 00:10:22.360
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

00:10:23.693 --> 00:10:27.293
So this was another play that He had.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.360
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.560
But in modern times it's very difficult,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.326
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:52.627
I mean, nobody will understand also.

00:10:55.527 --> 00:11:02.360
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

00:11:02.493 --> 00:11:05.693
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

00:11:06.393 --> 00:11:10.527
and also empowering the person with

00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:15.660
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

00:11:17.326 --> 00:11:19.860
And that's why we had to find out these methods

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.360
by which we could give realization to people.

00:11:26.793 --> 00:11:33.326
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.360
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.326
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:47.360
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:53.627
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:57.660
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:59.326 --> 00:12:06.493
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:15.426
The first is that His character was 'madhurya', meaning the sweetness.

00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:23.360
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

00:12:25.727 --> 00:12:32.360
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:42.360
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:49.360
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

00:12:50.693 --> 00:12:56.693
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.326
Everything is madhurya for Him, His talking,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:11.360
His actions, His face. Everything is madhurya.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:18.360
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.560
the communication between human beings

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:27.460
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

00:13:27.727 --> 00:13:32.360
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.560
which is not true.

00:13:37.593 --> 00:13:41.627
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

00:13:43.393 --> 00:13:49.360
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.527
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.293
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

00:14:01.627 --> 00:14:07.360
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

00:14:08.627 --> 00:14:15.360
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.560
that trick one has to learn:

00:14:23.793 --> 00:14:27.793
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.627
This is one of His special qualities,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.693
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

00:14:39.293 --> 00:14:43.360
in a very sweet manner, and

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:52.593
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:56.360
Now there are many tricks

00:14:56.827 --> 00:15:03.360
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

00:15:05.326 --> 00:15:07.560
First of all, you must always show

00:15:07.593 --> 00:15:11.360
that you are less intelligent than another person.

00:15:16.593 --> 00:15:19.593
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.360
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know;

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:31.360
no good for a scientist." So they feel "ah, very good."

00:15:38.693 --> 00:15:43.693
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:50.360
No, I just have learnt a little bit, but not much."

00:15:51.693 --> 00:15:53.693
Musician feels very happy.

00:15:53.727 --> 00:15:58.360
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.360
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.360
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.560
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

00:16:20.627 --> 00:16:26.360
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:36.760
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.360
but I would like to hear" this is first.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.693
The first quality of communication is to be

00:16:46.693 --> 00:16:48.693
extremely humble about yourself.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.360
The other person should not know who you are.

00:16:55.693 --> 00:16:59.360
And there's a lot of fun in it.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:06.393
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:10.693
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.360
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.360
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

00:17:21.527 --> 00:17:23.360
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.293
just a useless, small, little place

00:17:27.326 --> 00:17:30.360
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.527
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.527
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.527
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:48.426
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

00:17:48.527 --> 00:17:51.360
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.493
She was shocked!, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

00:17:55.593 --> 00:17:59.326
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

00:17:59.493 --> 00:18:01.593
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.360
She had started looking down upon Me,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.360
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:20.360
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

00:18:21.527 --> 00:18:23.493
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

00:18:23.527 --> 00:18:28.360
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

00:18:28.693 --> 00:18:31.360
This boastfullness is of no use.

00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:35.860
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.360
But if you want I can try."

00:18:44.627 --> 00:18:53.727
So, is to play down as much as you can. Practice this at home.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.360
First, practice and then do it.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:05.293
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

00:19:08.393 --> 00:19:11.393
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.627
there's one is very important thing,

00:19:12.627 --> 00:19:15.460
It says "Krodhat bhavati sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

00:19:15.627 --> 00:19:20.460
You see among all the worst things that we have -

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:25.360
according to Him we have six enemies.

00:19:27.793 --> 00:19:31.493
But in Gita He started with 'Krodh'.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.360
He said - it starts with krodh, means anger.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:43.727
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

00:19:44.727 --> 00:19:50.360
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.527
He can make you dance like this.

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:57.360
What is the need to lose your temper?

00:19:58.693 --> 00:20:02.693
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

00:20:03.527 --> 00:20:07.727
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.693
and something starts barking,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.527
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:25.293
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.793
He has started with krodha, that: with the krodha all problems start.

00:20:33.493 --> 00:20:36.360
from one to another to another to another.

00:20:36.493 --> 00:20:40.693
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

00:20:44.527 --> 00:20:51.660
Anger comes from Vishuddhi, starts from liver - Vishnu -

00:20:52.326 --> 00:20:54.460
but expressed through Vishuddhi.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.360
Face becomes red, eyes become red.

00:20:58.693 --> 00:21:03.593
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.793
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

00:21:09.527 --> 00:21:15.360
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

00:21:15.793 --> 00:21:18.493
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

00:21:18.693 --> 00:21:23.760
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

00:21:24.493 --> 00:21:26.360
Many people I have seen people say

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.627
"Mother, do you know, this lady is such a hot-tempered women,

00:21:28.627 --> 00:21:31.727
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.560
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.627
No, no I'm very good."

00:21:37.627 --> 00:21:43.360
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

00:21:44.426 --> 00:21:47.360
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

00:21:47.793 --> 00:21:54.360
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.360
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.360
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.527
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.560
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

00:22:11.793 --> 00:22:19.693
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:22.360
There is no need to take to temper.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.527
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.860
Why are you doing that way?"

00:22:28.326 --> 00:22:31.360
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.360
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:40.360
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.360
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:52.627
If you just stop at a point,

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.360
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.627
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.360
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.360
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

00:23:10.627 --> 00:23:14.627
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.760
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.360
you feel very bad - "Why I said so? I should not have said this."

00:23:25.793 --> 00:23:31.460
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.827
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

00:23:36.293 --> 00:23:40.493
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

00:23:41.493 --> 00:23:44.460
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.293
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.360
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

00:23:58.793 --> 00:24:01.360
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.360
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

00:24:08.593 --> 00:24:12.527
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.760
you'll never feel guilty.

00:24:16.293 --> 00:24:19.360
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

00:24:19.627 --> 00:24:22.293
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

00:24:23.593 --> 00:24:26.560
Next time you won't do it.

00:24:27.793 --> 00:24:31.693
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:38.693
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

00:24:40.326 --> 00:24:41.360
And I'm very much worried about

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.360
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

00:24:47.493 --> 00:24:51.660
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

00:24:52.393 --> 00:24:57.360
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

00:24:58.793 --> 00:25:04.426
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.326
and when you touch them it becomes water.

00:25:10.393 --> 00:25:15.627
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.593
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:25.360
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.793
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.827
But women don't, they keep it there

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.693
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.827
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

00:25:44.527 --> 00:25:48.426
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.360
but it's tears just to impress another person that

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.360
you are very sad or something.

00:26:05.627 --> 00:26:11.393
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

00:26:11.727 --> 00:26:15.360
and the third one is how to master

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:22.360
the temper of others - that's even better.

00:26:24.793 --> 00:26:27.293
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.360
Gagangadh Maharaj, when I went to him.

00:26:31.493 --> 00:26:34.293
He is a very hot-tempered avadhuta, sitting on

00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:36.360
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

00:26:36.527 --> 00:26:38.360
so he was sitting in the water

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.727
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

00:26:43.793 --> 00:26:46.293
I never saw the tiger, of course.

00:26:46.326 --> 00:26:49.593
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

00:26:49.627 --> 00:26:51.593
so I went to see him.

00:26:51.793 --> 00:26:57.360
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.393
for about one and a half hours,

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.326
and as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

00:27:04.326 --> 00:27:07.593
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.493
so he felt very challenged!

00:27:10.693 --> 00:27:14.627
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.360
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:21.393
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.793
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

00:27:28.326 --> 00:27:30.360
He touched My feet, everything he did and then he said,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.360
"You tell me now - why did You not allow me to stop the water?

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.627
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know,

00:27:40.693 --> 00:27:44.426
but why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

00:27:44.627 --> 00:27:49.326
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

00:27:52.393 --> 00:27:57.527
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.693
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

00:28:03.393 --> 00:28:05.326
that too of an orange colour, and I would

00:28:05.393 --> 00:28:07.693
not take the orange colour sari from you.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.660
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.360
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:22.360
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master!

00:28:25.827 --> 00:28:33.827
First of all how to melt him, and secondly the master of his mind.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:41.560
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.627
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

00:28:46.493 --> 00:28:50.760
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.360
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.627
But if you try just to know about a person -

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.360
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

00:29:03.627 --> 00:29:07.360
So first try to understand a person.

00:29:09.627 --> 00:29:12.627
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

00:29:13.426 --> 00:29:16.460
and a very humorous person.

00:29:17.627 --> 00:29:20.360
And one day My brother told Me, Babamama,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.360
that he has a friend who sings very well.

00:29:24.393 --> 00:29:26.560
So I asked My father "How does he sing?"

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.727
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.493
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:40.293
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

00:29:40.493 --> 00:29:41.793
"He's very courageous you see.

00:29:42.326 --> 00:29:44.793
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:48.860
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.627
he said "He's courageous" -

00:29:50.727 --> 00:29:53.360
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.527
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.360
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

00:30:00.693 --> 00:30:05.360
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.360
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

00:30:14.326 --> 00:30:16.360
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.360
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

00:30:20.493 --> 00:30:24.360
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.360
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.360
with all his qualities, with everything

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.360
and accepting that person as he is.

00:30:41.293 --> 00:30:43.560
If that mastery you can have.

00:30:44.326 --> 00:30:48.393
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

00:30:48.493 --> 00:30:52.426
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:59.460
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.460
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.560
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

00:31:10.393 --> 00:31:16.560
Little additional svara (musical note) is added to his character.

00:31:17.493 --> 00:31:22.560
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You will really enjoy.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.660
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

00:31:27.326 --> 00:31:29.527
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.493
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.793
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:41.360
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

00:31:41.827 --> 00:31:47.827
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:54.360
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.827
or the defects of that person.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.894
But you need not say directly something to him.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.693
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

00:32:09.693 --> 00:32:11.693
that the person will understand.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:20.460
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

00:32:22.393 --> 00:32:27.527
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

00:32:27.593 --> 00:32:29.860
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

00:32:30.693 --> 00:32:34.894
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

00:32:35.426 --> 00:32:40.560
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

00:32:40.827 --> 00:32:44.894
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:53.393
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.593
that's no good.

00:32:55.693 --> 00:33:00.360
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.627
but you are lost forever for that person.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.360
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.693
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:11.927 --> 00:33:16.360
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.627
that it doesn't hurt the person,

00:33:20.293 --> 00:33:27.360
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:31.360
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

00:33:33.894 --> 00:33:44.360
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.693
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

00:33:47.793 --> 00:33:54.393
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

00:33:54.927 --> 00:33:58.527
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.960
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

00:34:04.426 --> 00:34:07.527
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:15.360
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.493
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.527
For example, if you want to say that:

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.426
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.527
should be there at the right time.

00:34:27.793 --> 00:34:29.593
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:32.894
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.627
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

00:34:35.827 --> 00:34:39.360
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

00:34:40.693 --> 00:34:44.293
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

00:34:44.326 --> 00:34:47.527
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

00:34:48.593 --> 00:34:52.460
for the time being. So transfer it.

00:34:52.894 --> 00:34:59.560
And this transference is 'hastaantar' as they call it.

00:34:59.727 --> 00:35:06.493
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.360
There is a story about Him

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.360
when He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.493
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

00:35:21.326 --> 00:35:25.693
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.593
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.360
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.360
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.827
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

00:35:43.627 --> 00:35:48.560
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

00:35:48.793 --> 00:35:55.293
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

00:35:55.493 --> 00:36:01.360
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.393
and if I open my eyes

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:09.393
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma"

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.793
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

00:36:16.627 --> 00:36:20.593
So He started running away from the field.

00:36:20.727 --> 00:36:23.593
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

00:36:23.927 --> 00:36:31.627
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

00:36:31.894 --> 00:36:38.360
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.360
and hid himself in the cave.

00:36:44.326 --> 00:36:47.693
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

00:36:47.894 --> 00:36:50.460
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.593
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.326
And he started waking [him] up.

00:36:56.527 --> 00:37:01.693
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

00:37:02.727 --> 00:37:10.393
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.894
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.894
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

00:37:22.493 --> 00:37:26.693
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

00:37:27.493 --> 00:37:32.927
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.393
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:42.493
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:47.560
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

00:37:49.927 --> 00:37:52.927
And so many tricks He played.

00:37:58.827 --> 00:38:06.727
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

00:38:07.393 --> 00:38:14.360
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

00:38:17.493 --> 00:38:27.560
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:34.360
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

00:38:34.894 --> 00:38:36.693
He told Arjuna not himself;

00:38:36.827 --> 00:38:43.360
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - sarathya.

00:38:43.793 --> 00:38:51.793
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:58.293
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:10.693
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

00:39:11.493 --> 00:39:16.660
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

00:39:17.593 --> 00:39:25.693
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

00:39:26.293 --> 00:39:29.560
How are you going to save there?

00:39:31.894 --> 00:39:36.460
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.793
while Arjuna was his disciple.

00:39:40.894 --> 00:40:06.727
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

00:40:07.326 --> 00:40:10.660
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

00:40:10.894 --> 00:40:19.927
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

00:40:20.527 --> 00:40:24.827
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.360
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:35.527
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.426
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:49.426
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

00:40:51.426 --> 00:40:55.560
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

00:40:56.827 --> 00:41:02.493
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:04.693
To get rid of the ill -

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.527
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

00:41:08.527 --> 00:41:13.493
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.393
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:24.393
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

00:41:25.326 --> 00:41:27.426
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

00:41:28.793 --> 00:41:31.894
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

00:41:32.493 --> 00:41:38.627
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

00:41:38.894 --> 00:41:44.326
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

00:41:44.827 --> 00:41:49.326
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

00:41:49.727 --> 00:41:53.960
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:59.560
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:06.560
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.793
Without weapons also He can do everything.

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:15.360
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

00:42:16.693 --> 00:42:24.360
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

00:42:26.293 --> 00:42:28.560
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

00:42:29.393 --> 00:42:33.293
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.527
because I don't want them to see.

00:42:35.727 --> 00:42:40.460
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.360
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

00:42:44.927 --> 00:42:47.426
and you know what they are playing with you.

00:42:47.627 --> 00:42:52.894
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

00:42:53.293 --> 00:42:57.693
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.527
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.593
will improve very much with others.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.793
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

00:43:13.393 --> 00:43:19.527
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

00:43:20.593 --> 00:43:22.460
What is bhootish?"

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.493
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

00:43:26.693 --> 00:43:31.326
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.660
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

00:43:36.593 --> 00:43:41.627
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.360
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

00:43:46.493 --> 00:43:50.393
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.527
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.293
then it's even more important.

00:43:57.527 --> 00:44:00.493
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

00:44:00.527 --> 00:44:02.360
We'll have to take it out."

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.593
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

00:44:07.627 --> 00:44:11.894
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.693
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.560
because you know he is cunning.

00:44:18.426 --> 00:44:19.960
What's the use of playing with that?

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.793
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:27.360
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

00:44:29.326 --> 00:44:35.426
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.627
Not the whole world.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.560
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:49.760
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

00:44:50.493 --> 00:44:52.593
It's not meant for ordinary people.

00:44:53.426 --> 00:44:58.360
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

00:44:58.493 --> 00:45:02.693
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

00:45:03.393 --> 00:45:06.560
and we find that they create problems for us.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.393
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.627
as Shri Krishna dealt with gopas and gopis;

00:45:16.693 --> 00:45:21.693
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:28.760
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:33.927
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.693
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

00:45:38.627 --> 00:45:42.593
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:48.460
And He did it because He was such a master.

00:45:49.593 --> 00:45:53.894
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

00:45:54.326 --> 00:45:56.560
to master himself, because He knew himself,

00:45:56.727 --> 00:46:00.760
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

00:46:01.894 --> 00:46:03.593
When you know everything

00:46:03.693 --> 00:46:06.693
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.560
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:22.360
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:22.593 --> 00:46:26.894
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.360
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:39.727
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

00:46:41.393 --> 00:46:45.793
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

00:46:46.593 --> 00:46:48.894
As I must have told you so many examples

00:46:49.426 --> 00:46:51.393
that the western negativity is like this

00:46:51.393 --> 00:46:55.760
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

00:46:57.593 --> 00:47:00.660
They don't like to work anyway.

00:47:00.827 --> 00:47:08.527
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

00:47:08.894 --> 00:47:12.360
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

00:47:12.527 --> 00:47:17.627
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.693
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

00:47:22.627 --> 00:47:27.693
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

00:47:28.727 --> 00:47:33.360
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

00:47:33.527 --> 00:47:37.660
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

00:47:38.293 --> 00:47:41.393
Except for your brain everything works.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.793
But the other way around it is:

00:47:45.527 --> 00:47:49.393
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

00:47:49.693 --> 00:47:53.560
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:59.660
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

00:48:01.293 --> 00:48:03.560
I must do something."

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:07.527
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:13.627
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

00:48:14.727 --> 00:48:17.360
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

00:48:17.426 --> 00:48:19.560
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.927
if that is not available do this.

00:48:22.493 --> 00:48:25.894
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:32.627
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.760
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.360
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

00:48:40.894 --> 00:48:43.360
the Master of Masters we should say.

00:48:43.593 --> 00:48:50.360
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

00:48:51.393 --> 00:48:52.927
She thought of Shri Krishna.

00:48:53.393 --> 00:48:58.727
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:01.393
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.693
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

00:49:05.326 --> 00:49:07.360
So She was holding on.

00:49:07.727 --> 00:49:10.527
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:18.426
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:27.527
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

00:49:27.693 --> 00:49:33.360
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

00:49:34.793 --> 00:49:39.460
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:43.727
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:53.693
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

00:49:55.293 --> 00:49:58.393
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

00:49:58.627 --> 00:50:02.393
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

00:50:02.593 --> 00:50:08.360
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.793
to save the chastity of His sister -

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:17.527
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

00:50:17.793 --> 00:50:22.727
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.660
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.593
which are too many!

00:50:32.927 --> 00:50:38.860
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

00:50:39.493 --> 00:50:42.560
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.793
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.860
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

00:50:52.593 --> 00:50:58.326
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:03.627
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.293
But if you believe in yourself

00:51:09.727 --> 00:51:16.760
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:51:17.693 --> 00:51:23.360
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

00:51:24.894 --> 00:51:30.860
then I'm sure you can become masters.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.393
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:39.560
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.560
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:47.360
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

00:51:47.527 --> 00:51:49.393
Nobody has been to university.

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.660
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

00:51:56.827 --> 00:51:59.460
Krishna never went into university,

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:04.326
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:09.527
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

00:52:09.927 --> 00:52:12.560
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.360
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

00:52:18.094 --> 00:52:21.326
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.426
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.527
what will it look like?

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.860
But it's not that you dominate

00:52:31.393 --> 00:52:36.360
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:41.593
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.426
This is the mastery you have to get.

00:52:44.693 --> 00:52:48.960
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.727
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.360
is that we have to master ourselves.

00:52:55.293 --> 00:52:57.094
But then immediately people say

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:02.493
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

00:53:04.593 --> 00:53:06.593
I can't understand this.

00:53:07.727 --> 00:53:12.360
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

00:53:13.727 --> 00:53:18.660
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

00:53:19.094 --> 00:53:24.894
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

00:53:25.027 --> 00:53:27.360
why can't you correct your own property?

00:53:28.793 --> 00:53:30.360
It should be the easiest thing to do

00:53:30.393 --> 00:53:33.460
but you're not sure that this is your own,

00:53:33.727 --> 00:53:37.393
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

00:53:37.693 --> 00:53:41.894
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

00:53:43.326 --> 00:53:47.027
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

00:53:47.326 --> 00:53:53.360
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

00:53:55.426 --> 00:53:57.994
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.527
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:09.293
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:13.727
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

00:54:14.027 --> 00:54:16.994
This is happening? Put it that way.

00:54:17.627 --> 00:54:22.360
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.760
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.827
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

00:54:32.326 --> 00:54:35.593
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:40.760
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

00:54:40.793 --> 00:54:43.693
the whole world, to emancipate them.

00:54:43.827 --> 00:54:46.660
To bring them out of their ignorance.

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.393
So for that we have to develop this mastery

00:54:52.727 --> 00:54:55.727
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.360
but this mastery has to be developed.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.493
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.360
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.393
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

00:55:11.727 --> 00:55:17.360
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

00:55:19.493 --> 00:55:22.360
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

00:55:22.426 --> 00:55:28.927
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.593
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

00:55:33.827 --> 00:55:37.360
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

00:55:40.326 --> 00:55:42.994
And the last, but not the least,

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:52.393
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

00:55:53.693 --> 00:56:02.360
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.693
In these three forms you should see yourself.

00:56:07.027 --> 00:56:13.060
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.527
how I'm acting here!"

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.660
Then you become the spectator also.

00:56:20.094 --> 00:56:23.360
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

00:56:23.994 --> 00:56:28.426
then you will realize what you are doing,

00:56:29.326 --> 00:56:31.994
how you are working out everything.

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:38.360
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

00:56:39.326 --> 00:56:40.860
will just run away.

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.360
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.360
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:54.360
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:01.360
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

00:57:01.827 --> 00:57:03.760
"let me face it."

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:08.060
But also there is another way out, people find out.

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.060
I mean, there are ways and ways.

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:14.326
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.693
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

00:57:17.527 --> 00:57:20.627
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

00:57:20.894 --> 00:57:24.360
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

00:57:26.827 --> 00:57:29.693
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.527
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

00:57:32.793 --> 00:57:38.727
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:42.527
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

00:57:42.693 --> 00:57:44.693
So what next?

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.627
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

00:57:49.027 --> 00:57:52.293
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

00:57:52.426 --> 00:57:57.027
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

00:57:57.326 --> 00:58:02.960
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

00:58:03.393 --> 00:58:05.994
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

00:58:06.293 --> 00:58:12.360
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

00:58:12.994 --> 00:58:18.593
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

00:58:18.994 --> 00:58:23.660
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

00:58:26.627 --> 00:58:32.660
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

00:58:33.894 --> 00:58:38.360
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

00:58:38.527 --> 00:58:43.693
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

00:58:44.094 --> 00:58:45.660
you can correct yourself.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:51.627
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

00:58:52.094 --> 00:58:55.860
and you are so detached that you can see it.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:04.460
The attachment to all the things are finished

00:59:04.793 --> 00:59:09.460
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

00:59:09.527 --> 00:59:12.927
and acting on these attachments also.

00:59:13.593 --> 00:59:21.493
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

00:59:21.727 --> 00:59:24.860
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

00:59:25.293 --> 00:59:27.860
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:30.360
It's the other way around.

00:59:30.527 --> 00:59:33.727
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

00:59:33.894 --> 00:59:37.360
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

00:59:38.326 --> 00:59:43.527
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

00:59:43.593 --> 00:59:48.426
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:51.493
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:57.593
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.960
I'm talking at the time of peace.

01:00:00.894 --> 01:00:06.293
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.827
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

01:00:09.894 --> 01:00:13.460
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:18.960
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.360
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

01:00:22.593 --> 01:00:24.360
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:26.560
but you are part and parcel of it.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.727
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:36.960
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

01:00:37.727 --> 01:00:42.027
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.960
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.460
and be one with the body of the Virata.

01:00:52.593 --> 01:00:55.560
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

01:00:55.827 --> 01:01:00.860
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

01:01:01.493 --> 01:01:05.027
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

01:01:05.627 --> 01:01:12.060
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.527
that you should have for all the other people

01:01:16.527 --> 01:01:17.994
and immediately they'll recognize.

01:01:18.293 --> 01:01:21.360
I have seen small children are like that.

01:01:21.894 --> 01:01:24.527
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.527
They see their parents and this and that.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.560
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

01:01:32.627 --> 01:01:35.627
after all God is there to look after."

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:43.293
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

01:01:43.393 --> 01:01:45.360
they will neutralize the whole thing.

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:48.360
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.360
from all the little babies that we have

01:01:51.493 --> 01:01:58.360
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.994
with innocence we should work it out.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.027
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

01:02:05.627 --> 01:02:09.460
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.960
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

01:02:13.293 --> 01:02:17.360
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

01:02:17.493 --> 01:02:20.527
May God bless you.
