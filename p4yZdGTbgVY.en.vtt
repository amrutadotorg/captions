00:02.000 --> 00:15.920
It’s so beautiful to come back to London to meet\h
all of you, again, after such a big gap, I felt.

00:18.720 --> 00:24.880
It’s a funny feeling one gets when you\h
leave the country and you are away,\h\h

00:25.840 --> 00:29.840
and then you find other people\h
same way when you leave them.

00:33.200 --> 00:43.840
You feel an ocean of compassion and love.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.880
We have been very successful in India.

00:48.800 --> 00:58.000
Indian climate is, I think, changing very fast and\h\h

00:58.000 --> 01:02.480
people are finding it easier to\h
take to Sahaj Yog than before.

01:04.160 --> 01:11.840
Luckily, some people were cured by Sahaj\h
Yog which made people think about it.

01:13.520 --> 01:18.160
Apart from that, they found out,\h
as you found out about Blake,\h\h

01:20.320 --> 01:30.000
that a gentleman, a very famous seer known\h
as Bhrugu, who wrote the prophecies about\h\h

01:30.000 --> 01:40.080
modern times two thousand years back, has talked\h
about Sahaja Yoga very clearly and he says that,\h\h

01:42.720 --> 01:49.600
not so precise as Blake is but,\h
in a way, about Sahaja Yoga, that\h\h

01:52.880 --> 02:01.520
the Kundalini Shakti will be\h
awakened in a very Sahaja way.

02:03.280 --> 02:09.760
And that it’s a new system by which\h
thousands will get realisation.

02:11.040 --> 02:15.040
According to his proportions, in one crore.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.000
Crore is how much Gavin?

02:18.800 --> 02:19.600
Hundred thousand?

02:20.640 --> 02:24.240
Ten million?

02:25.200 --> 02:26.160
Ten Million.

02:26.160 --> 02:32.400
Among ten million people, there will\h
be one person who will get realisation.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.240
Then these people will start\h
giving realisation to others\h\h

02:37.120 --> 02:40.960
and so many will get their\h
Atmasakshatkar, means Self-realisation.

02:41.760 --> 02:48.560
Also he describes about vibrations and so many\h
things, and what happens after realisation.

02:48.560 --> 02:54.000
That you can start seeing the Kundalini and\h
all those minute things with your naked eyes.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.080
That you can see the throbbing of\h
the Kundalini with this new method.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.000
And so many things he has described: that\h\h

03:00.880 --> 03:05.760
they had to take to Sahaja Yoga because they knew\h
this was it – that’s what you have to expect.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.880
And it worked out so well that\h\h

03:14.640 --> 03:17.840
thousands and thousands of people, thousands.

03:19.280 --> 03:25.120
Now, it is very important for these seers to see\h\h

03:25.760 --> 03:30.880
those things of the future because human\h
beings are such that, unless and until they\h\h

03:30.880 --> 03:36.960
have something already certified, you see – the\h
‘bonafides’ of a person – people don’t believe,\h\h

03:38.720 --> 03:43.040
and that’s why it was important that such\h
a thing was written about Sahaja Yoga.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.400
Because what I have studied\h
with other people who came to me\h\h

03:48.400 --> 03:52.880
from other groups is that: most\h
of them were brainwashed people.

03:52.880 --> 03:57.760
I mean, they didn’t know what they were talking\h
about, they didn’t know what was Kundalini,\h\h

03:57.760 --> 04:03.280
they didn’t know what was Self-realisation,\h
they did not know any one of their own powers,\h\h

04:03.280 --> 04:09.280
they did not know how to work it out – nothing!\h
I mean they were just zeros! Just zeros you see.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.720
And they just were wearing some dresses and\h
things like that and wearing some sort of\h\h

04:14.720 --> 04:23.680
a necklace or maybe a bangle in the hand, to\h
say that they belong to a particular cult,\h\h

04:24.400 --> 04:28.960
but they didn’t know what it was,\h
actually nothing was intelligible to\h\h

04:28.960 --> 04:34.640
me, to understand why were they in\h
that cult, what were they doing there.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.520
And everybody was hoping for\h
the future, for the future.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.920
I concluded on one point: I think most\h
of the Western people are futuristic.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.440
They live in the future.

04:47.440 --> 04:51.680
Neither in the past, nor in the\h
present, but they live in the future.

04:52.240 --> 04:57.680
And these futuristic tendencies\h
make you hope for something better,\h\h

04:57.680 --> 05:01.040
that something will come\h
out, something will work out.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.440
“Let me do what I’m doing, is alright."

05:03.440 --> 05:13.600
And they don’t even want to think that, “What\h
I am doing, is it correct or incorrect?”\h\h

05:13.600 --> 05:17.440
They just accept whatever they have accepted.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.920
Maybe it’s also another ego-trip,\h\h

05:19.920 --> 05:24.640
perhaps, that, “I have accepted this, now\h
I don’t want to change,” sort of a thing.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.200
But I was surprised, they\h
didn’t know anything about\h\h

05:28.160 --> 05:33.840
God, about themselves, about their Spirit,\h
about their Kundalinis, about their chakras,\h\h

05:33.840 --> 05:40.480
about anybody’s chakras – nothing! They\h
were just in the dark, lost people.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.600
And real seekers, absolutely real seekers!

05:44.880 --> 05:49.040
I was amazed at the way they got realisation also.

05:49.040 --> 05:53.280
Some of the foreigners who came\h
in Delhi were wonderful people.

05:53.920 --> 05:58.160
But they said, “We think drug is the\h
way!” I said, “But why do you think\h\h

05:58.160 --> 06:05.200
like that?” You see they have conceptions which\h
are futuristic also, that, “We are experimenting\h\h

06:05.200 --> 06:10.640
with this we are experimenting with that, and\h
definitely we are going to reach somewhere."

06:10.640 --> 06:15.760
But, supposing, if you are coming to Caxton Hall\h
and if you are directed towards the airport,\h\h

06:15.760 --> 06:17.360
how will you come to Caxton Hall?

06:17.360 --> 06:21.360
Maybe if you go round the whole world,\h
maybe! If you think the world is round.

06:22.640 --> 06:26.080
But the plane of God, is not a round world.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.160
It’s an ascent.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.720
It’s an ascent.

06:30.720 --> 06:36.960
It’s not that you can go here, there, there,\h
everywhere, and then somehow you find God.

06:36.960 --> 06:37.760
It’s not like that.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.600
Or somehow you find your Spirit.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.960
It’s a higher level.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.000
It’s a higher position one has to rise [to].

06:44.000 --> 06:46.640
It’s not at the same level\h
[that] you are going to find it.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.880
This they don’t understand.

06:48.880 --> 06:49.840
They don’t understand.

06:49.840 --> 06:54.880
They think that on this level only if\h
you move, with this human awareness,\h\h

06:54.880 --> 06:59.920
what we have, with our rationality, with our\h
thinking, by our reading, we’ll achieve that.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.400
I was amazed, I mean, I didn’t know\h
that human beings think like that,\h\h

07:04.400 --> 07:08.960
that you can achieve anything with your\h
rationality and with your intelligence.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.080
You cannot! What can you achieve?

07:12.080 --> 07:15.320
Because whatever is to be achieved,\h
you have already achieved that.

07:15.840 --> 07:24.480
But what is to be understood [is] that, these\h
futuristic people think that the way they are\h\h

07:24.480 --> 07:30.640
progressing, or whatever the way they are moving,\h
[that] they are moving the right direction.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.320
Until they are completely finished and\h
fagged out how are they going to find out?

07:39.520 --> 07:44.640
It’s a complete brainwash for these\h
people and it’s a very dangerous thing.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.600
I was myself so much upset with all that.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.400
But I do not know what is the solution for\h
these people if they are that futuristic.

07:55.120 --> 07:59.040
Now we must know what happens to a\h
person when he becomes futuristic.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.080
It’s a very dangerous\h
situation also [in] every way.

08:02.080 --> 08:07.120
Physically, mentally, emotionally, in every\h
way, a futuristic person has lots of problems.

08:07.680 --> 08:12.720
The first problem that arises by living\h
into the future is that you forget the past.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.760
You completely forget the past.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.000
You just live in the future, you forget the past.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.800
You don’t even remember, sometimes, your own\h
name! We had one gentleman who came to see me.

08:25.520 --> 08:30.320
He was the president of a Dhulia conference\h
or something, a big man, supposed to be.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.200
He came round.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.280
And he didn’t remember even his\h
wife’s name! Can you imagine?

08:35.280 --> 08:36.720
And the wife was crying, poor thing.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.160
She said, “He doesn’t even remember my\h
name Mother! It’s gone so bad as that."

08:40.800 --> 08:50.640
So I asked him, “Do you remember your name?” So he\h
said, “Well, I think…let me think, let me think.."

08:50.640 --> 08:55.280
Now thinking is moving right side! You\h
see, left side is finished! “I think.."

08:55.280 --> 08:55.920
again.

08:55.920 --> 09:03.680
He couldn’t! And I found out from him that\h
he was planning and he was doing this.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.440
“I’m going to do this to Dhulia’s city.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.160
I’m going to work out this for\h
Dhulia city and I’m going to\h\h

09:11.200 --> 09:15.920
arrange this…” and everything was in\h
his mind but nothing that was past.

09:16.480 --> 09:22.960
And the balance was so much upset that he\h
was absolutely future and nothing of past.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.840
He had very high blood pressure,\h
very high blood pressure.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.160
And imagine a person who doesn’t\h
even remember his own name,\h\h

09:30.160 --> 09:33.520
to walk about in the streets\h
of London! One would be lost.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.320
You know, police would have to catch\h
hold of him and put him in a jail.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.360
It’s a very abnormal situation.

09:39.920 --> 09:45.360
But we reach that situation because we\h
start enjoying that kind of a thinking,\h\h

09:45.360 --> 09:50.720
indulging into that kind of a rationality\h
and then ending up with a life like that:\h\h

09:50.720 --> 09:56.320
high blood pressure, heart\h
trouble, diabetes, paralysis.

09:58.960 --> 10:03.840
Anything is possible with this kind\h
of movement of futuristic attitude.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.560
But future does not exist, does not exist.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.520
It is just in our mind.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.160
And whatever is in our mind is not reality.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.240
That we have conceived ourselves.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.880
Reality is what it is.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.000
You cannot conceive it.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.240
It exists.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.040
Only thing what we can do is to rise up to it\h\h

10:25.040 --> 10:29.120
and to see for ourself what\h
reality is, actually what it means.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.840
Now the trouble with this ego business\h
is that it’s like a balloon, you know.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.080
It’s really like a balloon.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.560
The more you start thinking about\h
it, it takes you away from reality,\h\h

10:41.840 --> 10:45.760
like as if you float in the air and\h
you don’t know what you are doing.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.720
You have lost all contacts with the Mother\h
Earth and you are floating in the air.

10:50.720 --> 10:57.440
This has started in us because when we became\h
human beings from the animal stage you see,\h\h

10:59.040 --> 11:06.880
we started taking up upon ourselves\h
the responsibility, responsibility to\h\h

11:06.880 --> 11:11.920
be ourselves, that we are something: I am\h
something, you are something, you are Mr.

11:11.920 --> 11:12.720
X, you are Mr.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.520
Y, you are Mr.

11:13.520 --> 11:13.760
Z.

11:14.400 --> 11:19.200
But as human beings are – go to the extremes\h
as usual – they cannot stop at a point.

11:19.840 --> 11:24.400
So they went into such a limit of extremes [that]\h
now they have forgotten also ‘I’, who is this ‘I’.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.320
You ask the name they said, “By\h
the way I think this, that."

11:29.040 --> 11:32.480
So all identifications are lost with the past.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.280
And one may say that it is\h
a very good thing because\h\h

11:35.280 --> 11:37.680
they were all misidentifications [that] are lost.

11:37.680 --> 11:42.880
But even the identifications with\h
the future are also hallucinations.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.840
That’s not the Truth.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.520
That’s not the Truth.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.320
One has to be in the present.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.280
And how do you do it?

11:49.920 --> 11:56.800
Not by listening to any lecture or\h
going to any library to find out.

11:57.920 --> 12:01.040
You cannot do it, again, with\h
this brain that is today.

12:02.000 --> 12:12.240
You have to have a brain which has that spark\h
in it, that light in it – enlightened brain.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.880
You are to be an enlightened person.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.800
Unless and until you are enlightened\h\h

12:16.800 --> 12:21.280
you cannot see your way through, you are walking\h
in the dark, really you are walking in the dark.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.120
And when this light comes into you…that is the\h
light within us, placed there all the time.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.600
Is the light of our Spirit.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.120
It has to come in our attention.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.640
And God has arranged\h
everything for us, everything.

12:37.200 --> 12:45.600
There’s a way of our germination which\h
has to take place, and when it takes place\h\h

12:48.560 --> 12:54.320
you can feel that Spirit in your attention.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.880
Now there is another misunderstanding\h
I find [that] people have about Spirit:\h\h

12:59.440 --> 13:01.760
they think Spirit is an energy.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.240
It is not! It’s not an energy.

13:05.200 --> 13:10.800
Energy can be transformed, it can be changed, it\h
can be evolved, it can be handled and all that.

13:10.800 --> 13:17.040
Spirit is not! Spirit is absolute! It cannot be\h
compared with anything else that you know of.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.200
It is an absolute thing.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.640
It resides in your heart.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.920
It’s the reflection of God\h
Almighty, within ourselves.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.080
And you cannot call it an energy.

13:30.080 --> 13:35.360
Energy can be finished off, spent\h
away, it can disappear into thin air.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.720
Not the Spirit.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.240
It’s a permanent entity.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.320
It is absolute, by itself, and it\h
cannot be compared with anything else.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.240
I mean, just to give an\h
analogy, one can say something,\h\h

13:46.240 --> 13:48.560
but that’s a different point – just to give.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.320
But you cannot compare an absolute\h
with anything that is relative.

13:53.840 --> 13:59.600
So that’s an absolute thing within you, which\h
resides in your heart, and when this residual\h\h

13:59.600 --> 14:10.000
power of Kundalini rises it ignites the attention\h
within you with this spark of the Spirit.

14:11.120 --> 14:15.280
Now, supposing, this light is\h
here, take it [as an example].

14:15.280 --> 14:19.520
If you put on this light – of course this\h
light is an energy so you cannot compare\h\h

14:19.520 --> 14:23.840
with anything you know, that’s the trouble, but\h
still [if] you say this is the light – now this\h\h

14:23.840 --> 14:29.120
light enlightens this whole atmosphere\h
and we start seeing things here clearly.

14:29.680 --> 14:38.720
But do you think that light which is\h
there is the one that is your attention?

14:39.360 --> 14:40.000
Not at all.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.640
Your attention is enlightened by that light.

14:48.080 --> 14:58.080
The light enlightens your attention; by that\h
attention you can feel the All-pervading Power,\h\h

14:58.080 --> 15:03.920
the Divine Power, the energy of God, the Divine\h
Energy of God, the energy of love of God.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.880
You can feel it because it’s a connecting link.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.800
Spirit is the connecting link.

15:10.800 --> 15:15.360
But it is completely absolute.

15:17.120 --> 15:26.080
It just connects you to that All-pervading\h
Power, that All-pervading Power.

15:26.080 --> 15:36.720
I think we have talked about Creation when\h
we said that, the whole Parabrahma became\h\h

15:37.840 --> 15:42.080
the energy and God Almighty, which was\h\h

15:44.720 --> 15:48.480
lost in the Parabrahma, means [in] a\h
sleeping state, became the Witness.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.840
Now this Witness is in the heart of human beings.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.920
This Witness is all the time there.

15:56.640 --> 16:01.440
When it disappears you do not\h
exist! So it is not an energy.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.120
One has to understand.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.600
Actually someone has written a book on Sahaja Yoga\h
and when I was going through it I was shocked to\h\h

16:07.600 --> 16:14.880
read that he thinks that Spirit is an\h
energy! So, energy, the Shakti, is not\h\h

16:15.680 --> 16:18.800
that Spirit and the Spirit is not Shakti.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.840
They have to meet.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.560
They have to meet so that\h\h

16:25.760 --> 16:30.240
the enlightenment in human beings, [of]\h
the chitta (attention), takes place.

16:33.120 --> 16:39.600
Our ideas, whatever they are, are ideas.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.480
Even when I say to you\h
something, I have always told\h\h

16:45.680 --> 16:49.440
that you shouldn’t take me for granted\h
– you should see [for] yourself.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.840
You should see for yourself how it works out.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.400
But first of all you must have that\h\h

16:54.400 --> 17:00.720
microscope – the Spirit – you must\h
have that level of understanding.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.200
You should go to that point,\h
you must have the breakthrough.

17:03.200 --> 17:08.560
If you have not broken through\h
that you won’t understand anything.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.600
You are not yet connected,\h
there’s no enlightenment.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.840
Without enlightenment what’s the use of talking?

17:14.480 --> 17:20.080
Now, supposing I go and tell you\h
there are red coloured curtains here\h\h

17:20.080 --> 17:25.920
and there’s a black coloured beams here,\h
anything, and if the other person is blind,\h\h

17:26.720 --> 17:30.160
they are not going to understand anything [about]\h
what is black what is red, what is yellow.

17:31.200 --> 17:35.680
But this is the truth, that we are blind.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.320
And also this is the truth that we can see.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.920
And then we can see the real Truth.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.760
So the truth that appears\h
before us now is not the Truth.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.000
After realisation it is the real Truth.

17:53.840 --> 18:00.320
I know one thing that, in the West,\h
the rationality has gone too far.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.760
People rationalise everything, which\h
has killed all the joy of life.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.960
Everything they rationalise,\h
which kills the joy of life.

18:09.520 --> 18:13.760
In the East people just do not\h
rationalise, they do not think about it.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.120
That is also going too far.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.120
But there is a meeting point\h
between the East and the West.

18:20.640 --> 18:25.120
And the greatest [thing] of all is that\h
the West has discovered the science.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.360
Science is responsible, today, for Sahaja Yoga.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.080
Only through science we are going\h
to spread Sahaja Yoga – if people\h\h

18:34.080 --> 18:36.640
understand what is the meaning of Sahaja Yoga is.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.960
It’s a very dynamic thing no doubt.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.160
It’s working out tremendous things.

18:42.160 --> 18:49.440
But not in the places where people are\h
very rationally judging everything.

18:50.080 --> 18:56.000
Like a tree has got a shoot and a root.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.480
If it has got a shoot it has to have a root,\h\h

18:58.480 --> 19:01.440
otherwise shoot cannot hang in\h
the air! It has to have a root.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.680
Now, in the West, we are the shoots.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.840
You see, everybody can see everything.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.080
You can see what we have achieved,\h
“This is the achievement."

19:12.080 --> 19:15.040
We have got big, huge affluent societies.

19:15.040 --> 19:19.360
People are working out all kinds\h
of gadgets and this and that.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.560
But from where is the energy coming?

19:22.560 --> 19:27.760
Somebody must have worked the down way\h
also, in the root, which you cannot see.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.960
To understand the root you\h
have to change your style.

19:33.920 --> 19:38.400
It’s alright, to become the shoot was different,\h
but supposing you have to understand the root,\h\h

19:38.400 --> 19:41.280
you have to go down and you\h
have to change your attitude.

19:41.280 --> 19:51.840
And that attitude is of trying to\h
understand that we are not yet our Spirit.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.960
All the prophets, all the great incarnations\h
have said that, “You are to be born again,”\h\h

20:00.000 --> 20:01.840
that you have to become the Spirit.

20:01.840 --> 20:02.560
We are not.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.200
Let us very humbly accept that.

20:05.200 --> 20:09.200
If you accept that, that we are not\h
yet realised souls – that’s all,\h\h

20:09.920 --> 20:13.200
we have to know – then it’s easier.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.000
But if we think, now people come to Sahaja\h
Yoga’s system, I have seen, in the West,\h\h

20:18.000 --> 20:20.400
it’s very difficult to convince them.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.240
I have to sit in a particular manner\h
I have to talk in a particular manner\h\h

20:24.240 --> 20:27.680
and I may not be that good\h
at English manners maybe.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.080
So they will say that, “Oh, this lady is no good,\h
she doesn’t know any English manners!” you see.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.600
And they’ll judge you on\h
some superficial things which\h\h

20:36.880 --> 20:39.440
may be good for the shoot, but not for the root.

20:42.880 --> 20:48.160
Under these circumstances it is rather\h
difficult to convince people about Sahaj Yoga.

20:48.160 --> 20:53.440
But you must know that I am now talking\h
about the roots and not about the shoot.

20:53.440 --> 20:58.000
Shoot you have got, you have got it, but\h
you have to find the sustenance of it.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.240
If you do not find it, the\h
whole thing will topple down.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.360
As it is very important to have the shoot,\h\h

21:05.360 --> 21:08.880
it’s even more important sometimes\h
to have a root, after some time,\h\h

21:08.880 --> 21:15.120
because if you are exhausted in your energy\h
it’s better to develop your root system,\h\h

21:15.680 --> 21:23.520
enrich it so that you sustain your society much\h
better and achieve the fruits of your creation.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.880
I see some new faces here and I’m\h
very happy to see that there are\h\h

21:28.880 --> 21:30.640
some new people who have come to Sahaj Yog.

21:31.200 --> 21:36.320
For all the new people I would like to say one\h
thing: that many people come to Sahaja Yoga\h\h

21:37.760 --> 21:43.040
out of which, of course, now we have many people\h
who are now realised souls here, sitting down.

21:43.040 --> 21:48.080
It’s a great thing that there are so many\h
realised souls in England, specially in London.

21:48.720 --> 21:54.880
But many are lost because they\h
just judge things on their own way.

21:55.760 --> 22:01.040
So I have to request that you must give\h
some time to yourself and to Sahaja Yoga,\h\h

22:01.040 --> 22:02.480
because you are all seekers.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.080
I don’t want you to be lost.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.480
The other day somebody read me out from John’s\h\h

22:09.840 --> 22:17.520
Gospel that he says that only\h
144,444 people will be saved.

22:17.520 --> 22:22.560
I said, “This is very miserly\h
of him to say such a thing!”\h\h

22:25.360 --> 22:30.240
“That’s all?” I said, “That’s\h
all?” I mean how can it be?

22:30.880 --> 22:35.280
Only such a small number?

22:35.280 --> 22:38.320
I just couldn’t believe that\h
how could he say such a thing.

22:38.320 --> 22:44.000
Perhaps his counting is wrong I think, or\h
whatever it is, but I hope so it’s not that bad.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.080
And how many are going to join\h
from England, we have to see.

22:48.080 --> 22:58.080
Blake had great ideas, he wanted to build\h
Jerusalem, and he went into all kinds of details.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.680
I hope we’ll be able to do\h
some justice to him as well.

23:05.440 --> 23:16.560
It is a great pleasure to come back to your\h
own children after such a long stay there.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.640
I always thought of you here.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.400
All of you were in this cold, facing\h
the cold weather of this country.

23:26.160 --> 23:37.760
And also, was thinking that, one day, this country\h
will become a great country of spiritual life.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.240
I know this has to work\h
out from this country only.

23:42.800 --> 23:49.840
In India of course, it’s very easy,\h
but this country is the heart, heart,\h\h

23:50.480 --> 23:52.080
and we have to establish here.

23:52.720 --> 23:56.240
It’s difficult I know, but we\h
all have to work very hard.

23:57.040 --> 24:05.040
And, after this, I hope you all decide to go all\h
over, wherever possible, to spread Sahaja Yoga.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.600
That is the greatest thing that we have to do.

24:07.600 --> 24:14.640
This year, according to astrology in India,\h
the English are going to come up with new ideas\h\h

24:14.640 --> 24:18.880
and I would like to know their new ideas\h
when we have this birthday celebration.

24:20.480 --> 24:25.760
So, is it for birthday celebration today\h
that, Gavin, you have arranged this programme?

24:28.880 --> 24:33.760
Birthdays are good when you are growing, but when\h
you are getting old they are not so good isn’t it?

24:36.720 --> 24:39.840
This birthday has a special significance I feel\h\h

24:42.720 --> 24:46.240
because, in that book also,\h
it is written that, this year,\h\h

24:46.960 --> 24:50.560
something great should happen and\h
something great should come up.

24:51.440 --> 24:56.640
And we all have to understand\h
that, if we lose the time,\h\h

24:57.600 --> 25:03.360
maybe we’ll lose many people who are\h
just lost because of their ignorance.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.880
And we have to save them, we\h
have to definitely save them.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.240
There is no doubt [that] they are all seekers.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.640
They are seekers and lost.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.680
It’s our duty to save them.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.840
We have to really work very hard\h\h

25:17.840 --> 25:24.400
to find out all such people and go close\h
to them, talk to them and help them.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.840
Thank you very much.

25:29.200 --> 25:33.680
From the new people I would like to\h
have some questions if there are any,\h\h

25:33.680 --> 25:38.320
because when we go into meditation\h
I do not want your mind to come up\h\h

25:38.320 --> 25:41.840
and suddenly say, “Oh, you\h
did not ask this question."

27:24.400 --> 27:27.360
or to think about it or to work it out.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.640
It’s a spontaneous thing.

27:29.200 --> 27:35.760
As you place a seed in the Mother Earth\h\h

27:35.760 --> 27:42.000
and the warmth of the Mother Earth, which you can\h
say the love of the Mother Earth sprouts the seed.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.200
In the same way this germination takes place,\h\h

27:47.200 --> 27:51.680
this germination takes place within\h
you, automatically, spontaneously.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.320
You don’t have to do anything about it.

27:54.320 --> 27:58.640
We have done nothing to become human\h
beings and we have to do nothing\h\h

27:58.640 --> 28:00.640
to become super-human beings also.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.600
Afterwards, after realisation, of\h
course you have to maintain yourself.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.440
Like you have to maintain yourself to be\h
a human being and not to become a beast.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.880
In the same way, you have to remain an angel\h\h

28:12.880 --> 28:16.560
and not to become a fallen angel,\h
after realisation, that’s all.

28:17.280 --> 28:23.840
And it works out, absolutely spontaneously,\h
and you become, again [I’m saying] you become.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.600
You really become a different person.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.240
You start noticing that difference showing in you.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.360
With some people it takes more time.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.840
With some it takes very little.

28:36.800 --> 28:42.640
But I have seen people have to go,\h
in that transition period, carefully.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.200
But it works out, it does work out.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.800
I haven’t yet seen a person who\h
has got realisation [who] is lost.

28:51.360 --> 28:55.120
He comes back I see there are vibrations\h
still he has not worked it out,\h\h

28:55.120 --> 28:59.600
of course, there are problems, but still,\h
you can maintain it, you can put it right.

29:00.160 --> 29:05.920
So this is the Kundalini and there are six\h
centres above that and one centre below.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.480
Now these six centres are within us.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.920
All of us have got it.

29:09.920 --> 29:16.000
These are the subtle centres which\h
give us our plexuses and these plexuses\h\h

29:16.000 --> 29:19.680
are the gross manifestation of these centres.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.640
These centres are pierced through.

29:22.640 --> 29:29.120
Only the six centres, because the seventh\h
one is at the base of the Kundalini.

29:29.120 --> 29:35.680
That’s our innocence and that’s the\h
one which is not pierced through.

29:36.880 --> 29:42.560
The Kundalini rises, passing through these\h
centres, pierces through this fontanelle\h\h

29:43.120 --> 29:49.120
bone area, and gives us a\h
real, actual baptism – actual.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.640
It’s not that “I baptise you,”\h
put the hand there, it’s not that.

29:52.640 --> 29:57.600
You actually feel the throbbing on\h
your head and you see the piercing,\h\h

29:57.600 --> 30:03.600
by feeling the cool breeze of the\h
Holy Ghost pouring out of your head.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.200
You can feel it very clearly.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.120
That’s how it is.

30:07.120 --> 30:14.560
It is surprising how people reconcile\h
to things because they say that the\h\h

30:17.040 --> 30:19.120
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost is there.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.320
Now where is the cool breeze?

30:20.320 --> 30:22.080
Ask these people.

30:22.080 --> 30:27.760
We say that, “We bless you with the Trinity."

30:27.760 --> 30:29.520
But where is the cool breeze?

30:30.080 --> 30:31.440
Where is the cool breeze?

30:31.440 --> 30:34.480
When you talk of blessing\h
somebody with the Trinity\h\h

30:34.480 --> 30:39.040
there has to be the cool breeze because cool\h
breeze of the Holy Ghost has to be there.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.320
And there is no cool breeze,\h
so how are we to believe that\h\h

30:42.320 --> 30:45.360
what they are saying is what they are meaning?

30:45.360 --> 30:47.200
And that is what is the Truth is.

30:47.200 --> 30:51.200
You have to have the cool breeze of the\h
Holy Ghost and where is the cool breeze?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.520
That’s one of the points one should find out.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.960
Now this cool breeze is not\h
only a simple cool breeze.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.400
It definitely acts, it works, it cures.

31:01.360 --> 31:08.240
There is a case, recently, interesting, that I\h
was actually in a village in India when a father\h\h

31:09.680 --> 31:20.560
of a son came to see me, who, the son, was sent\h
to America for treatment for blood cancer, And,\h\h

31:21.840 --> 31:26.800
of course, I gave vibrations from there but I\h
asked one of the American girls to treat him\h\h

31:26.800 --> 31:29.680
and he’s cured, hundred percent\h
he’s out of the hospital.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.920
Yes, it can be done! And it is so fantastic.

31:33.920 --> 31:34.960
you can do it.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.840
I need not do.

31:35.840 --> 31:36.480
You can do it.

31:36.480 --> 31:41.600
It’s that girl Christine who has done it and\h
she has cured him, completely, hundred percent.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.920
The boy is out of the hospital\h
and is going back to India.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.280
So all these things can be done.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.120
This has to happen.

31:49.120 --> 31:56.480
Once it works out then one has to work\h
out a little bit more to understand\h\h

31:56.480 --> 32:00.320
how to use the power, how to use the power.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.040
It’s very simple, it is so spontaneous.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.360
Nobody told us how to see.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.560
Did anybody tell us?

32:06.560 --> 32:08.080
We have eyes, we can see.

32:08.080 --> 32:09.360
It is so spontaneous.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.000
Because we have got eyes which\h
can see, so we are seeing it.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.440
What is there to be told about\h
it or taught about it that,\h\h

32:15.440 --> 32:19.280
“You see that now there is a…” It is\h
there, we can see it with our own eyes.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.160
What is there to teach?

32:20.160 --> 32:23.360
Do we teach our own nose that\h
there’s a fragrance coming in?

32:23.360 --> 32:24.880
It knows that it is coming in.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.320
This is known as bodha.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.360
It is the knowledge by which you can feel it.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.040
It’s not the knowledge that you read in the books.

32:35.040 --> 32:41.840
If you read in the books “The roses\h
smell like this,” will you get the smell?

32:42.400 --> 32:47.680
Or [if] there are some people who wear a\h
Rolls Royce on their neck, a picture of\h\h

32:47.680 --> 32:52.960
Rolls Royce and they think, “We are going in a\h
Rolls Royce very nicely!” Do you do that way?

32:52.960 --> 32:54.320
It’s stupid isn’t it?

32:54.320 --> 32:57.120
But it is the stupid things people do.

32:57.120 --> 33:01.920
They carry on with such artificial\h
things believing that they are doing it.

33:01.920 --> 33:08.320
So one has to know that it is an actualisation,\h
it has to happen, it has to work out within you.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.920
You cannot just befool yourself saying\h
that, “I am that, I am this, I am that."

33:12.640 --> 33:15.040
If you say, “I am the governor,”\h
do you become the governor?

33:15.600 --> 33:18.800
It’s simple as that, absolutely very simple.

33:18.800 --> 33:23.760
And, once it happens, as it is\h
simple to you to be a human being,\h\h

33:23.760 --> 33:26.160
it will be as simple to you to be a Sahaja Yogi.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.960
Only thing: to be a Sahaja Yogi you have to know.

33:30.880 --> 33:35.200
As you have learned your language you have to\h
know the language of Sahaja Yoga: what does\h\h

33:35.200 --> 33:39.760
this finger means, if you get the burning on this\h
finger what does that mean, what does this mean.

33:39.760 --> 33:44.240
Everything you have to know, just decoding, and I\h
am here just for decoding, nothing more than that.

33:47.320 --> 33:51.840
Now any more questions?

33:53.800 --> 33:58.960
Seeker: Yes, is it possible for the\h
Kundalini to be opened prematurely?

34:02.960 --> 34:13.360
Hypnotism or brainwashing or\h
something and you can do anything\h\h

34:13.920 --> 34:18.160
good with it, constructive, is it\h
possible to have this opened prematurely?

34:18.160 --> 34:19.093
In a non-developed state

34:19.093 --> 34:27.680
Shri Mataji: Kundalini doesn’t need any\h
development it is complete by itself.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.280
It doesn’t need any development as such.

34:31.280 --> 34:38.560
But, what happens, when the Kundalini passes\h
through these centres, the centres could be sick,\h\h

34:39.600 --> 34:47.920
could be constricted, there could be a problem,\h
somebody may be an imbalanced person, or you may\h\h

34:47.920 --> 34:53.200
be a person who doesn’t follow certain rules\h
and regulations of sustenance, could be there.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.098
Some sort of a thing is there.

34:54.098 --> 34:59.120
Seeker: Could it be the person might be too open?

34:59.120 --> 35:03.040
Shri Mataji: Yes, vulnerable type\h
who accepts everything, you see.

35:03.040 --> 35:03.600
Seeker: Yes.

35:03.600 --> 35:08.880
Shri Mataji: goes to the lunatic\h
asylums also, wants to be with the\h\h

35:10.000 --> 35:13.440
rogues and wants to be with this,\h
wants to be with that, all that.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.000
You see, such a person can be also in torture.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.520
But that is the path, the path of\h
Kundalini could be in trouble, could be.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.760
But Kundalini is not that way.

35:23.760 --> 35:27.360
Of course, sometimes She is so hurt,\h
I have seen her being very much hurt,\h\h

35:27.360 --> 35:29.840
passing through that path She feels so hurt.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.280
But that’s a different point.

35:31.280 --> 35:37.040
Now this Kundalini is there, just matured,\h
sitting down there, waiting for a moment to rise.

35:38.080 --> 35:45.440
Now what happens, when people who are not\h
authorised by Divine Power of God, who are not\h\h

35:45.440 --> 35:51.600
holy people – we should put it straight forward,\h
who are not really holy people but just are\h\h

35:56.400 --> 36:01.200
unholy people, or you can put any strong\h
word you want – ‘hypocrites’ or anything.

36:02.880 --> 36:09.600
If they try any tricks with the Kundalini then\h
there’s a Deity sitting on the first centre,\h\h

36:10.560 --> 36:18.080
He hits them hard! And that hitting can cause\h
big problems, like people can develop blisters.

36:18.080 --> 36:22.640
Not the Kundalini, she is extremely kind, she\h
is your Mother, She is not going to do any harm.

36:22.640 --> 36:32.320
But this Deity which is the Deity embodying\h
your innocence, it can’t bear any wrong entry\h\h

36:32.320 --> 36:38.800
to the Mother, so that Deity gets angry and you\h
get problems of the sympathetic nervous system.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.040
And such people have so many problems.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.680
They can have blisters on the body, even cancer!\h\h

36:45.600 --> 36:49.200
Because these people have no\h
authority, they cannot awaken it.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.640
They cannot awaken it.

36:50.640 --> 36:58.400
For example, if you put a seed under\h
a hot blanket, will it prosper?

36:58.400 --> 36:59.200
It will die out.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.880
It has to be the Mother Earth.

37:03.760 --> 37:09.040
In the same way the one who is authorised\h
to do the Kundalini awakening has to do it.

37:09.040 --> 37:15.320
Anybody who tries otherwise\h
then He harms the person.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.000
And [it] can be very harmful.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.440
So that kind of a horrible\h
thing happens to many people\h\h

37:21.440 --> 37:25.680
when they just try to bow to wrong type of people.

37:26.320 --> 37:30.560
This head is not to be bowed to anyone\h
who has not given you realisation.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.200
Why should you?

37:31.200 --> 37:34.480
You shouldn’t bow to me also! I have\h
not given you realisation [yet].

37:34.480 --> 37:36.880
When I will give you realisation,\h
then you should bow to me.

37:37.440 --> 37:42.000
But in India if you tell people, “Don’t\h
bow to me,” they have already accepted me,\h\h

37:42.000 --> 37:46.240
you see, so they feel very hurt if I say,\h
“Don’t bow to me you are not realised."

37:46.240 --> 37:51.840
But here I would say, I would prefer a person\h
not to bow to me till he has got his realisation.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.280
That is very important.

37:53.280 --> 37:59.280
Because after all, I may be a hocus-pocus –\h
could be, possibly – so why trust me that way?

37:59.280 --> 38:01.440
Don’t put your head at my feet.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.840
You just have your realisation first and then.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.000
But it is quite true, people are\h
playing havoc with it, absolutely havoc.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.720
It’s very dangerous.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.440
You see a person who doesn’t\h
know how to put on the light\h\h

38:13.440 --> 38:16.640
can burn his fingers and say\h
that electricity is wrong.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.880
But he doesn’t know anything, he’s naive.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.600
To put it very mildly we can say they are naive.

38:25.680 --> 38:31.840
But there are sinister people also who\h
deliberately do it just to torture people.

38:37.680 --> 38:41.280
That’s why people are frightened\h
also to hear about Kundalini.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.880
I know a gentleman has written such a\h
thick book and he says the Kundalini\h\h

38:44.880 --> 38:49.760
is in the stomach! I said, “It’s not there,\h
it’s not there!” I mean, it’s so absurd to\h\h

38:49.760 --> 38:53.120
hear such things, but they right\h
books without any authority.

38:53.120 --> 38:57.040
You see, anybody can talk about God!\h
Hitler used to talk about God also!\h\h

38:57.040 --> 38:59.840
Who’s going to catch hold of him?

39:02.080 --> 39:04.720
But you can see the throbbing of the Kundalini.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.080
In these programmes you can see, of some\h
people, where there’s an obstruction.

39:08.080 --> 39:12.720
On the Nabhi chakra, you can see the\h
throbbing; clearly you can see it.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.440
Many, all, of these people have\h
seen, those who are sitting.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.120
What else?

39:21.120 --> 39:22.000
It’s a good question.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.040
Because it’s very common.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.120
I have seen people have read about Kundalini.

39:25.120 --> 39:27.600
You are all seekers you know, you are all seekers,\h\h

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
so you are seeking, you are\h
reading all these books.

39:29.600 --> 39:36.080
I know that you are reading all these books\h
and that’s how you know about all these things.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.360
But it’s not the main thing.

39:39.360 --> 39:44.800
Main thing is: Kundalini awakening must give\h
you realisation, must give you your own power.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.200
I may be very powerful, or\h
whatever it is, so what?

39:47.200 --> 39:48.640
What’s the use?

39:48.640 --> 39:52.800
Unless and until you have some powers of\h
your own, why should you believe anyone?

39:54.960 --> 39:58.080
But people are brainwashed you see;\h
there is some purpose behind it.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.760
It’s money making propositions.

39:59.760 --> 40:11.425
All are money making\h
propositions, take it from me.

40:11.425 --> 40:16.080
Seeker: How do you raise the Kundalini Mother,\h\h

40:16.080 --> 40:16.800
what can you do?

40:16.800 --> 40:22.240
Shri Mataji: Nothing! Just now we’ll do\h
it but it’s nothing [that] has to be done.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.600
That’s the main point.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.640
It’s sahaja.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.000
It’s just spontaneous.

40:26.000 --> 40:31.920
Nothing! What can we do to make a flower a fruit?

40:33.080 --> 40:34.960
It’s as simple as that.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.760
Alright?

40:35.760 --> 40:36.560
It will work out.

40:37.280 --> 40:44.720
That’s a good question [it] means\h
you are anxious [to get it].

40:44.720 --> 40:52.000
What about getting all the people who are\h
new in front and all the people who are old,\h\h

40:52.000 --> 40:59.120
very old, a little backward (laughing).

40:59.120 --> 41:00.080
So all those.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.480
Is there anybody sitting at the back who is new?

41:03.680 --> 41:05.840
Come forward, please, come forward.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.520
There is nothing to be frightened about Kundalini.

41:15.520 --> 41:19.840
She is your Mother, She’s extremely kind.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.737
Sahaja Yogi: Mother should we make\h
room for people to come and sit down?

41:21.737 --> 41:23.520
Shri Mataji: I mean, they can’t sit on the ground.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.240
So, those who can sit on the ground can come down.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.760
Yes, that’s alright, yah.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.240
First two rows is alright if they are there.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.360
Just come along! Come along! It’s good.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.280
Come here, come here, come forward, yah.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.120
Come along, come, yah.

41:46.800 --> 41:47.840
These are all seekers.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.360
Don’t worry.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.600
Don’t worry about anything.

41:54.160 --> 42:01.840
You see, even if you have been taking drugs,\h
if you have been going to other gurus,\h\h

42:03.120 --> 42:07.840
you might think you are a sinner or you\h
might think you are a very guilty person.

42:07.840 --> 42:11.680
Whatever you are thinking, now forget\h
about it! Just forget about it.

42:11.680 --> 42:15.440
Don’t feel guilty, that’s first\h
thing, is – don’t feel guilty.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.438
You should say, “Mother, I am not\h
guilty,” that’s very important.

42:18.438 --> 42:18.650
That’s one thing: that you are not guilty.

42:18.650 --> 42:18.777
You are the temple of God.

42:18.777 --> 42:19.008
You have come here to become that, to know that.

42:19.008 --> 42:19.187
So you are not to feel guilty at all.

42:19.187 --> 42:19.541
That’s one of the greatest problems\h
of the West is that they feel guilty.

42:19.541 --> 42:19.692
So please tell yourself thrice,\h\h

42:19.692 --> 42:20.102
clearly that, “Mother I am not guilty,”\h
For anything! Everything will be forgiven.

42:20.102 --> 42:20.154
What is it?

42:20.154 --> 42:20.225
It is nothing.

42:20.225 --> 42:20.607
Say there’s an ocean of forgiveness, an\h
ocean of love, an ocean of compassion.

42:20.607 --> 42:20.668
What is this?

42:20.668 --> 42:20.800
Little speck here and there?

42:20.800 --> 42:20.899
Cannot be washed off?

42:20.899 --> 42:20.993
It’s very simple.

42:20.993 --> 42:21.205
Your karmas and all that Christ can suck it.

42:21.205 --> 42:21.535
He resides here, once he’s awakened\h
he’ll suck all your problems.

42:21.535 --> 42:21.629
Just don’t worry.

42:21.630 --> 42:21.691
Trust in Him.

42:21.691 --> 42:21.719
Good.

42:21.719 --> 42:21.804
Agnya opening out.

42:21.804 --> 42:22.219
Now what you have to do is to put your hand\h
towards me like this, because these are all\h\h

42:22.219 --> 42:22.676
the centres which are to be awakened so the news\h
goes through this, or the message, you can say.

42:22.676 --> 42:23.044
And you can put the, both the hands\h
towards me like this and close your eyes.

42:23.044 --> 42:23.138
That’s important.

42:23.139 --> 42:23.384
Don’t open your eyes because when Kundalini comes\h\h

42:23.384 --> 42:23.733
up here there’s a dilatation of the\h
pupils so just keep your eyes shut.

42:23.733 --> 42:24.087
But sit in a very relaxed manner, very\h
relaxed, very relaxed, very relaxed.

42:24.086 --> 42:24.331
Just put both the hands\h
towards me, just like this.

42:24.331 --> 42:24.388
Can you put?

42:24.388 --> 42:24.459
Just like this.

42:24.459 --> 42:24.591
Put your hands also please.

42:24.591 --> 42:24.737
Why don’t you put your hands?

42:24.737 --> 42:24.878
Seeker: I only came to listen.

42:24.878 --> 42:25.100
Shri Mataji: No there’s nothing more talking.

42:25.100 --> 42:25.237
Just put your hands, please.

42:25.237 --> 42:25.463
There’s a right Agnya from the very beginning.

42:25.463 --> 42:25.703
Put both the hands towards me and close your eyes.

42:25.704 --> 42:25.803
Just close your eyes.

42:25.803 --> 42:25.959
(Mother rubs her hands and blows)

42:25.958 --> 42:26.066
Keep your eyes closed.

42:26.067 --> 42:26.439
If they are flickering then you can open\h
them, otherwise you keep them closed.

42:26.439 --> 42:26.580
And keep the face also still.

42:26.581 --> 42:26.906
No emotions or anything, just keep\h
it still in a mood of witnessing.

42:26.906 --> 42:27.255
In a mood of witnessing you should\h
sit, putting both the hands towards me.

42:27.255 --> 42:27.590
It works out, actually should work\h
out in a second, split of a second,\h\h

42:27.590 --> 42:27.958
but the problem is, because of certain\h
complications it takes time sometimes.

42:27.957 --> 42:28.042
Doesn’t matter.

42:28.042 --> 42:28.320
But it should work out.
