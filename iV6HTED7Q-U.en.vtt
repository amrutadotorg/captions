WEBVTT

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:13.594
I have just told them that you should not try to
copy the western style of ego-oriented society

00:00:13.688 --> 00:00:18.114
where people use harsh words, because then we
think that we have modernized ourselves, you see.

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:23.344
To say harsh words to somebody,
“What do I care! I hate you!”

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:27.658
All these sentences we have never used, you see, which is unknown to us.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.888
I mean, anybody to say like that is unmannerliness.
How can you say such a thing: “I hate you!”?

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:36.984
But now I have heard people talking
like this in our country. “I hate you.”

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:42.294
“What’s wrong with us?”
“Who are you to say that?”

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:46.364
Like that we do not talk. You see,
his is not the way to talk at all.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.584
Any person who comes from a
good family would not talk like this

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:52.597
because it reflects on the family.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:56.059
But the language is more copied here than there.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.861
I'm surprised sometimes when I hear the
people [how] they talk in the buses, in the taxies,

00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:05.888
in the things; the way they use language
is, you see, is something I can’t understand.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:08.980
So I have asked them that the
language should be full of love

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.776
and with our own traditional style, the way…

00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:18.470
You see, we wouldn’t even scold our children. If
you have to scold the children, we use a language

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.485
which makes them over honourable (Bahumanarthi)

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:27.245
Damle Sahab has put on a kurta pyjama, so,

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:34.673
“You are looking like Shivaji
Maharaj. Welcome Shivaji Maharaj.”

00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:38.478
We should speak in such respectful
language so that they would not get scared.

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:41.840
Correction if it is to be done],
we used to do it this way;

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.642
but the correction of the other side is
not proper because that never it corrects.

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:50.156
You see, that’s why you
cannot control your children.

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:55.331
You are all the time insulting them,
insulting others, insulting methods, you see,

00:01:55.411 --> 00:02:01.491
and this emotional blackmail and all this
nonsense is not at all traditional in this country.

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:03.890
And those who’ll try to do it will be thrown out.

00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:06.289
I can tell you, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot work out.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.333
You should not have all
these ideas of insulting people,

00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:14.569
of bringing them into situations where
they can be insulted. This is all modern style.

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.886
So we should not do like that in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:22.703
We should behave in such a way
that we should be dignified people.

00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:27.741
Behoving our style is our tradition,
is Sahaja Yogis’ tradition is this

00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:31.141
that we talk to people in the
most sophisticated manner,

00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:37.291
in the sweetest manner, in the most
affectionate manner and inviting manner.

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:40.664
And that is how we all should
speak. So, this is [the] first thing I ask

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:45.894
that in your expression of your love there
should not be a thing that you should shout.

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:50.554
Now, I do shout at some people who have
bhoots in them, but by that the bhoots run away.

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:53.854
But if you shout, you get the bhoots.

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:58.466
The bhoots don’t run away,
they get at you; so better not do it.

00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:01.280
If you have My powers you
can do that; but you don’t have.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.347
If you shout at the person who has bhoots
(Shri Mataji laughs), you get the bhoots.

00:03:05.427 --> 00:03:07.547
So be careful, don’t try My tricks.

00:03:07.627 --> 00:03:10.167
You see, I am a different type of a person

00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:13.464
and I do everything so
understandingly, which you do not.

00:03:13.544 --> 00:03:17.643
So, when you follow Me, you
should follow Me the way I am,

00:03:17.723 --> 00:03:24.029
on the side where I forgive, the way I am
loving, I am affectionate; not where I am terrible.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.105
You shouldn’t do that because My terrible
nature has got the undercurrent of My Love,

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:33.047
which you don’t have, and you don’t
have these powers. So don’t try those tricks

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:36.386
with anybody else.
You have no right to shout at anyone

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.904
or to get angry, because if you shout,
you get back all these bhoots into you.

00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:45.802
They want, they provoke you, they
provoke you so that you get caught up into it

00:03:45.882 --> 00:03:48.664
and you get absolutely
ruined, the more you try to do it.

00:03:48.744 --> 00:03:56.058
So, the best thing is to stand in the
centre and have affection and love.

00:03:56.138 --> 00:03:58.863
Thepower that I have given you.
That you have.

00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:02.284
Develop that power of love. First
you develop that power of love.

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:06.695
Then you don’t have to worry, you don’t
have to shout, you don’t have to say anything.

00:04:06.775 --> 00:04:11.531
Your power will become the
Krita (active), it will work out itself

00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:16.921
and create that beautiful atmosphere that we
want to do. We don’t want anybody to be ruined.

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:20.045
But if you start shouting at
people, they’ll all run away.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:24.125
Specially in the ego-oriented
society, you should not shout at all!

00:04:24.205 --> 00:04:26.263
That will not appeal to anyone.

00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:29.744
If you shout at anyone in
the ego-oriented society,

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:32.359
you will always distract
them and they’ll run away.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.422
So I have to tell you, that you
might be the highest of highest,

00:04:36.502 --> 00:04:39.871
first thing [that] you have
to give Me today is that

00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:47.608
in your talk, in your behaviour, in
your heart, you will reside one with Love.

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:52.299
And the second thing I want to ask
is that you should be peaceful people.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.006
Try to have peace with
yourself. Don’t fight with yourself.

00:04:56.086 --> 00:05:00.460
Now, the western people have one
problem [that] they fight with themselves.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.651
“How is it this is happening to me? I am so bad.
I am no good. I have done this. I am so bad.”

00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:08.987
If you go on fighting with yourself,
then you will become week.

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:13.371
On the contrary, you must say, “I am so good.
What’s wrong with me? I’ve got realization.

00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:17.504
What’s wrong with me?”Have that
confidence in you, and then it will work out.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:20.985
And as result of that only
you start shouting at others.

00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:26.624
But supposing you understand that there is
nothing wrong with you, you have to be peaceful.

00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:29.858
We all have to be very peaceful
people and you have seen,

00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:33.948
My peaceful nature has solved
so many problems just like that.

00:05:34.028 --> 00:05:36.821
So try to achieve that peace within you.

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:39.767
That peace should not be lost at any cost,

00:05:39.847 --> 00:05:44.334
and should not be also expressed
outside in a way, like I sometimes.

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:48.304
My peace itself becomes terrible.

00:05:48.384 --> 00:05:52.099
But you don’t have that kind of a
possibility, so you just don’t do it.

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.981
You just don’t do it,
never do it that way.

00:05:55.061 --> 00:06:00.789
Try to be extremely peaceful,
try to make your forehead relaxed.

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.584
Many people come to Me
with [face] like this, you see,

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:09.052
then I just know that there is a big bhoot
on the head sitting, then I shout at them.

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:11.999
Keep your forehead relaxed, relaxed.

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:15.944
“I am not doing anything, Mother is
doing everything. Relax, relax, relax.”

00:06:16.024 --> 00:06:21.566
If you relax you’ll find
that your heart will open.

00:06:21.646 --> 00:06:25.190
“My heart cannot open.” Why,
why can’t you open your heart?

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.427
Because you have no trust in
yourself. Try to trust yourself.

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:37.564
Open your Agnya, open your Ekadasha
and your Sahasrara, and your heart will open.

00:06:37.644 --> 00:06:41.697
Once your Sahasrara is open,
your heart will open automatically,

00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:43.704
so you will have a peaceful life.

00:06:43.784 --> 00:06:46.676
So today I am asking
for two things from you.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:49.990
It’s a funny thing that a Mother
has to ask for a [Birthday] gift.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.584
And the gift you have to give – first one
– is that you should be peaceful people.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:59.722
You should express peacefulness
through your own character, talking.

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:04.425
But it doesn’t mean that you
should be people who are bleak,

00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:13.655
or who are – we can say that – are morbid
people or people who tolerate nonsense.

00:07:13.735 --> 00:07:15.824
No, there is a way of resistance.

00:07:15.904 --> 00:07:19.840
But a resistance, of a peaceful resistance,
that you are not afraid of anything;

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.355
you are not frightened of anything;
you are not going to bow down to anything;

00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:27.304
you are not going to compromise
with anything, but you are peaceful.

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:33.763
That sort of a temperament you must develop
and also express outside, is very important.

00:07:33.843 --> 00:07:41.053
And [the] second one is the…,

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:48.754
this peace and all this should express
your love to others, love to others.

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:54.115
Like now, everywhere, within next one or
two years we’ll have ashrams, I am sure of that.

00:07:54.195 --> 00:07:59.255
And in the ashram, I would
like to see people having loving,

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:06.270
caring, affectionate, patronising, beautiful
attitude towards the people who come there.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.420
On the contrary, if you do not have,
your ashrams will be all reduced to zero.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.322
It has happened in many
places; it will happen everywhere.

00:08:13.402 --> 00:08:16.488
So, you don’t blame Me,
“Why our ashrams don’t run good?”

00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:20.971
It will be your responsibility to
see that it is your Mother’s House

00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:23.672
and people are coming to the Mother’s House.

00:08:23.752 --> 00:08:30.664
And how a Mother would treat these people,
with love, affection, with whatever you have.

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:33.911
You can starve, but give
to others, look after them.

00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:38.909
Give them all the kindness and
sweetness so that the impression of people…

00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:42.049
Even if you are slightest
not like that, people will think,

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:45.106
“This is a very arrogant
personality. And how can it be?”

00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:48.664
So you have to be a top class
person to be in charge of an ashram.

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:52.642
If a person who is a mediocre,
he should not appoint.

00:08:52.722 --> 00:08:56.706
By God’s grace, I’m sure, by next year
you’ll have all the lands in your hand,

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:01.272
and all your ashrams will start
by next year in every country.

00:09:01.352 --> 00:09:03.031
May God bless you.
