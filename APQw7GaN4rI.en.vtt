00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.120
Interviewer: So, are you ready just to,
Shri Mataji, you started Sahaja Yoga

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.627
in India in 1970, could you please
tell us about those days?

00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:22.800
Shri Mataji: First, I thought that
better start from one person

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.800
and I tried to give realisation
to one leading.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.347
Cameraman: I’m sorry.

00:00:29.347 --> 00:00:30.004
Shri Mataji: At that time –

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.360
Interviewer: Okay, thank you.
This is just a test.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.320
Cameraman: I’m sorry Shri Mataji
we just have to test the noise.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.780
So now we can go.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.776
Shri Mataji: It’s all right, no no,
then again I said…

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:43.804
Cameraman: Now we can go so.

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:43.827
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:50.720
Interviewer: Oh no, it’s come undone.
Is there more tape there?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.300
Where’s that tape?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.337
Shri Mataji: Is Paul having some tape?

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:54.828
Interviewer: Where’s it gone?

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:57.600
Technician: Pause it, Nick. That paused.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.943
Cameraman: Okay, time Her in.
Ten seconds, Nick.

00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:07.700
Interviewer: Ten seconds, okay.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.780
Cameraman: Okay, go.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.720
Interviewer: Shri Mataji you started
Sahaja Yoga in India in 1970.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.107
Could you please tell us
about those days?

00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:29.200
Shri Mataji: First I had to discover
it Myself, how I will be able to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.160
give amass realisation,
that was one problem.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.520
But when I worked it out
then I thought first

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.640
let us try with one person
and there was a very nice lady,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.240
very pure personality.
I tried on her gradually

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.840
by clearing every centre
and she got it! Then I said it has clicked.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.424
Then I taught people who were coming…

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:07.723
Cameraman: I am sorry, I’m sorry,
I’m sorry. Can we start…

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:07.748
Interviewer: Start again.

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:08.820
Technician: Something started ticking.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.600
Cameraman: It’s this clock actually.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.860
Interviewer: That picking up
from your radio mic?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.800
Technician: No, something started ticking,
it wasn’t there before,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.160
it’s just started and now
the phones gonna ring.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.380
Can we have, can we have
the phone disconnected? Unplugged.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.227
Cameraman: I’ve also got another problem.
You’ve gotta have to come this side.

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:29.840
Cause it’s lit from there,
it’s just gotta more…

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.820
Shri Mataji: My throat is also
not very good today.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:45.947
Cameraman: Rolling, going in ten.

00:02:45.947 --> 00:02:49.546
Interviewer: Mind your shadow Paul,
on the edge there, okay.

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:53.497
Technician 2: Can you hear that Paul?

00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:54.346
Cameraman: There’s a telephone
going somewhere.

00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:55.940
Technician 2: Can you hear that phone?

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.627
Cameraman: Okay stop.

00:02:57.627 --> 00:02:59.268
Shri Mataji: Relax, relax. Calm.

00:02:59.268 --> 00:03:05.141
Technician: Yeah can you [UNCLEAR].
Let’s wait and put it on pause.

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.775
Cameraman: We’re rolling, so in…

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:07.829
Shri Mataji: It’s in my throat,
it won’t take long.

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.220
Cameraman: Rolling, Take four.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.320
Interviewer: Ready to begin? We go.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.348
Cameraman: Five seconds for you Nick.

00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:24.380
Technician: Take five.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.040
Interviewer: Okay. Shri Mataji you started
Sahaja Yoga in India in 1970.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.584
Could you please tell us
about those early days?

00:03:35.584 --> 00:03:43.920
Shri Mataji: So the first problem was
how to get people into the idea

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.040
of Sahaja yog[a] to tell them
about Kundalini

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.760
and to find out a method
by which you give them amass realisation.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.720
So I worked very hard for it
and ultimately I found out

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.120
the way how to do it!
By knowing the permutations

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.080
and combinations of the problems
that human beings have.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.280
And then I started lecturing,
they announced my lectures

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.120
and many people came to my lectures.
But I didn’t give them any realisation,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.440
I was just telling them that
we have to seek the realisation

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.720
and it’s possible in this lifetime
and we can work it out.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.000
Then out of them I sorted out a lady
who was very pure person I think

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.840
and I said let’s try on her.
So treating her on every chakra

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.560
with my attention, I raised her Kundalini
and she got it.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.800
And she felt very happy and joyous
and her eyes started shining

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:09.760
and she said ‘What has happened to me?’.
So then I told these people

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.200
that those who would like to come
for Self Realisation

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.520
they have to go for a little
away from Bombay [Mumbai].

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.640
So we took a trip to one small
little place where it was all very quiet

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:39.440
and the seashore was beautiful.
There the people who wanted

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.320
to have their Self Realisation
were still arguing and discussing.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.800
And that day I felt that
I should try on somebody else.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.280
And one gentleman on whom I tried
was a wonderful [UNCLEAR Musrati] gentleman.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.800
He got his realisation so beautifully
so they started saying

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.040
‘Oh God, we cannot get it
because after all we are good for nothing’

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.060
and all that. So that the first time,
I think in life I really got very angry

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.800
and I showed my anger and I said that
‘If you go on feeling like that

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.160
then it’s not going to worked out,
have courage in you

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.520
and it’s going to work out’.
And you’ll be surprised

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.760
that very same day when we had the session,
twelve people got realisation, out of them.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.400
There was about twenty six people
out of them; twelve got it

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.880
and two had got it earlier.
And one was so anxious to get it

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.400
but wouldn’t feel anything and suddenly
she told me later on

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.920
that in the train she started feeling
the cool breeze around her

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.520
so that’s how we had fifteen people
to begin with.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.800
But the twelve of them,
really worked it out because

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.400
even if you get realisation
you have to settle with it

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:20.080
and you have to get full
understanding about.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.920
With these twelve people
I started in India

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.120
and then this twelve people were once
compelled to give realisation

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.160
to a very big group of people in Nashik
because I was delayed,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.920
my car was broken on the way
and they had to start the work

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.680
and they did it! And they were surprised
that they could give realisation to them,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.760
of course they used My photograph
but they gave realisation to them.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.320
So they had confidence.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:56.360
We had many such incidents
where people were diffident about themselves

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.440
that how can they get realisation,
‘It’s not possible”

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:08.000
but when they saw others getting it
they just developed that faith in themselves

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.080
and those who developed that faith
in themselves got it.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:17.720
Then I had huge big meetings in India,
thousands came, of course that time

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.800
so many didn’t get realisation,
about ten to fifteen percent

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.560
used to get realisation
and then they used to drop off.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.960
Also they discovered that
by raising the Kundalini people get cured.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.880
So the first onslaught was that of the sick,
too much it was.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.320
I cured many people in Bombay,
many people in Bombay,

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.480
people came from all over the world.
I should say in the sense

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.080
that those who had relations and things.
But I found those people who were sick

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.840
people got cured but they had
no interest in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.680
They had no interest
in the benevolence of others.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.680
They just came for their curing,
that’s all.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.800
That’s how I felt that first thing is
that I must look after people

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.960
who can achieve this confidence
in themselves

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.600
and can achieve the state
of doubtless awareness.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.240
This happened, you would be surprised
in such a short time in India

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:31.720
that in 1972 my husband got elected
to this post in England.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.360
He was elected by one hundred
and thirty four nations

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.520
and our government insisted
that we should come to London

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:49.800
and we came to London, in the seventy three,
in the seventy three in January we were here.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.853
Interviewer: Could you please Shri Mataji
describe your…

00:09:54.853 --> 00:10:01.386
Cameraman: – Sorry Nick, can I just…

00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:05.288
Interviewer: Yep.

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:09.354
Cameraman: Okay rolling again.

00:10:09.354 --> 00:10:09.375
Technician: Take six.

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.840
Interviewer: Shri Mataji when you
came to London, could you tell us

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.947
your experiences?
How you found things here?

00:10:15.947 --> 00:10:22.560
Shri Mataji: Some organisation in India
informed another organisation here

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.320
that I’ve come to London and that they
should arrange a program for Me here.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:34.240
And they approached Me
and they arranged a program in London

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.880
by advertising in their magazines
or something like that

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.560
and when I came here. I found
most of the people who were here,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:52.880
were foreigners and not Indians,
very surprising.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:05.200
And they were, I think six or seven of them
got realisation so strongly

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.580
that I was amazed that these people
had no background, nothing.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.027
Cameraman: Sorry, we got to stop there.

00:11:10.027 --> 00:11:11.027
Interviewer: Yeah, are you on the wide shot?

00:11:11.027 --> 00:11:12.479
Interviewer: People who are foreigners,
not English?

00:11:12.479 --> 00:11:12.507
Shri Mataji: – Yeah, yeah.

00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:14.547
Interviewer: And some of them
got realisation very quickly?

00:11:14.547 --> 00:11:16.020
Shri Mataji: From the Organisation
should I talk?

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.947
Interviewer: Yes and you were very surprised.

00:11:17.947 --> 00:11:20.600
Shri Mataji: All right, should I say that
some Indian organisation.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.947
Interviewer: You said that,
yes we already got that. We’ve done.

00:11:22.947 --> 00:11:23.240
Shri Mataji: That’s done.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.280
Interviewer: We’ve done that. Yes and we
got to the way you said you found

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.604
more foreigners at your meetings and some of
them got realisation very quickly.

00:11:30.604 --> 00:11:30.627
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:11:30.627 --> 00:11:32.392
Interviewer: So we can go on from that.

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:32.427
Cameraman: Yeah we are ready to go.

00:11:32.427 --> 00:11:35.800
Interviewer: This is the pick up,
continue or whatever you call it.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.347
Technician: Take seven.

00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:39.160
Interviewer: When do we go?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:39.640
Cameraman: Yeah and go.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:47.480
Shri Mataji: Most of the people who were
there were foreigners, very surprising.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:54.880
And about six or seven of them
got realisation very strong,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.840
got a very strong feeling of realisation
and elation and joy was writ[ten]

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.800
large of their faces.
I was amazed because these people

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:15.040
had no background of realisation
or anything

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:25.120
and then to my amazement I found out
that they were hippies,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:32.200
not all but most of them were hippies.
So they told me

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:41.400
that they could have this program
of the petition in a place very close

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.960
to a hippie village that they had formed.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.360
Of course in the family, everybody was
worried when am I going to the hippies

00:12:52.360 --> 00:13:01.560
and I went down and it’s surprising
they had brought about thirty people there,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.600
all hippies.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.480
I felt they are seekers of truth
that they are taking these drugs and things.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:20.960
And really just started blurring my eyes,
I just couldn’t see them suffering so much.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.320
And some of them could see Me,
they just saw, they said later on

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.560
they was lights coming out of Me.
And some of them were something like coma,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.640
they didn’t know their names,
anythings in a horrid way.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:45.800
So of them, they again got
about ten people who got realisation

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.560
very well, surprising!

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.440
Next time I received a telephone call
saying that they have given up drugs

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.280
overnight and they want to see you.
We were living in a house

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.480
about twenty five miles away from London,
I said ”Come along this Saturday”.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:14.520
So they came down, they stayed over.
Beautiful people they were.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.400
So why do you make your hair
like primitive people?

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.240
Why do you want to live
like primitive people?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.660
And they were wearing dirty clothes,
smelling. I said ”Now, first of all,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.320
you go and all have baths”.
So I gave the soap, everything.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:35.560
I wanted them to change.
Then they came down and I was amazed

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:44.440
that they were very, very beautiful people.
Out of them about eight or nine

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.120
properly settled down in Sahaja Yoga
and that was the foundation.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.480
And I discovered that some of them
were professors, they were PHD’s

00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:00.400
and this and that, very learned people.
And the British whom I thought

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:09.320
would be the most difficult people
became so easily available for Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:16.280
Not only that but they really felt
duty bound to do something about it

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:22.000
because they thought I could save
of these people who are drug addicts.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.040
And the best part of it immediately
they were scholars went to the universities

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.880
and we got another scholar
who rushed from America to see Me.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.960
And they studied everything
about Kundalini,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:46.200
everything about what is Self Realisation is
and they’re back next Saturday again.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:53.400
And it was so beautiful to see their
anxiety, to help humanity,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.400
that’s how we started our work.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:03.400
But the one we had with us
who was a diplomat later on

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.200
also went from various countries
and then they got hold of

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.160
they’re friends and things and that’s
how this hippie movement

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:22.320
which was spread in the whole of Europe
gave us the connection.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.920
You see, like an ocean
which look so dirty on top,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.960
the undercurrent went through
and we got connection

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:40.240
with every nation in Europe. And that’s
how Sahaja Yoga started working out.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:46.400
But I went to France every year, four times
and worked very hard and today I must say

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:52.480
Europe has become a great Sahaja Yogi
continent, we should say a,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.840
such a great leader in the West.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.888
Interviewer: Thank you…It’s our
achievement if we can do that.

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:01.904
Cameraman: Okay.

00:17:01.904 --> 00:17:02.750
Shri Mataji: We can show a lot, you see…

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:02.770
Technician: Rolling.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:02.787
Interviewer: Yes.

00:17:02.787 --> 00:17:08.640
Shri Mataji: …Many people coming.
We can show all that, you see.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.680
Cameraman: Right, so Nick in five
when you are ready.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.947
Technician: Take eight.

00:17:19.947 --> 00:17:24.387
Interviewer: Shri Mataji could you please
explain what is this cool breeze people feel?

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:32.160
Shri Mataji: This cool breeze is the
All-Pervading power of God’s love.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:40.680
It is described in all the scriptures.
It is called as Ruh

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:46.080
or it’s called as the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost in the Bible

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.874
and also Shri Adi Shankaracharya
described it as “Salilam, Salilam”

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:58.840
means the cooling, cool and cool
so that is what you feel.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:07.120
First time you feel the subtle
All-Pervading power which does everything

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:17.200
which organises everything,
does all living work which thinks about all,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.980
it loves.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:31.147
Interviewer: Right, thank you. So could you
explain to us please about the Kundalini?

00:18:31.147 --> 00:18:36.280
Shri Mataji: Kundalini is a power
for our ascent,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.560
placed in the triangular bone
which is called as Sacrum

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:48.800
that shows that even the Greek’s knew
it was a sacred bone

00:18:48.800 --> 00:19:01.480
and it is the power of our pure desire
because all desires that we have

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:11.480
other than becoming self -realised
are not pure

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:19.600
because you jump from one to another.
This is the energy of pure desire within us

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:26.320
which when awakened rises,
passes through six centers

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:35.840
and emerges through the fontanelle
bone area emitting cool breeze.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.880
To begin with it might be hot
but later on cool breeze.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:53.520
This is the real baptism, this area
in Sanskrit called as Brahmarandra.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:01.280
But when this Kundalini rises,
it doesn’t give you any problems,

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:18.880
it doesn’t give you any extra movements
or you do not get into any stupid actions.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.680
It just rises and you just feel the end of it.
Of course in some people

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.640
they feel the heat little bit, that’s all.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:38.667
Interviewer: And what other effects
does this have on people, the Kundalini?

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:42.880
Shri Mataji: To begin with,
this is the energy

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.520
which connects you to the whole
All-Pervading power.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.800
Like any instrument has to be
connected to the mains,

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:58.600
so you get connected to the mains
and all the vitality starts flowing through you.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:08.400
As a result at different centers
you get different effects,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.760
but the first one that you get overall
is that physically you get cured.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:21.640
By your own power you get cured, physically.
Many diseases like cancer,

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:30.760
incurable diseases, many mental problems
can be solved if one can raise the Kundalini

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.000
and fix it up.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.040
Secondly, as I told you,
you can also solve emotional problems.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:50.200
You can also solve many social problems
because once the Kundalini is raised,

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:57.200
your spirit comes into your attention
which is, as they say in Sanskrit,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.920
is Sat-chit-ananda, is the one
which gives you the truth,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:09.600
which gives you the attention
which is effective and pure

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:16.400
and gives you the joy. So the wisdom
dawns upon you and the family life,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:22.720
everything improves tremendously.
But the best part of it is that

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:32.920
in modern Sahaja Yoga, anybody who gets
realisation after knowing about it properly,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:40.120
though they become Gnostics,
but they also develop a power

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:47.360
to raise the Kundalini of others
and give realisation to others.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:54.280
They become very peaceful, they witness
the whole world as a drama,

00:22:54.280 --> 00:23:01.440
and they become peers, as described,
or you can call them as saints.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:11.760
In India we had many such realised souls,
many of them, and now the time has come,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.240
as I call it, the blossom time,
and now today you can see

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.200
how many people there are,
thirty six nations we have got.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.040
They have all combined together,
integrated together, so peaceful.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.600
They have lost all these conditionings
of their so-called man-made religions

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:38.960
or their man-made boundaries of nations
and man-made ideologies.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.420
It opens our gates to everyone.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:50.741
Interviewer: Thank you. Okay, so
we got to the physical cue.

00:23:50.741 --> 00:23:51.680
Cameraman: Okay… five seconds.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.220
Technician: Take nine.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.980
Interviewer: Shri Mataji,
can self-realisation happen to animals?

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.800
Shri Mataji: Oh no, no, they cannot
because human beings are,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:13.160
they are the epitome of God’s creation,
and they have this right

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:21.680
to have this last breakthrough
into collective consciousness,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.320
the new awareness, which is described
by you very clearly,

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.360
because he also got his realisation.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:37.160
Interviewer: Okay, thank you,
as we come to Jung at the end. So, cut it.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.943
Cameraman: We are rolling in five.

00:24:39.943 --> 00:24:44.720
Shri Mataji: You can see one thing, here,
that the…

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.880
Cameraman: Okay, we are rolling.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.814
Technician: Take ten.

00:24:52.814 --> 00:24:54.400
Interviewer: Shri Mataji, is there
an organisation for which people

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.320
have to pay money for their self-realisation
in order to keep them committed to?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.040
Shri Mataji: This is the living process
of the living energy of living God

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:13.080
and you cannot pay because
God doesn’t understand money,

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:26.320
but it is important that they have to be
free to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.800
There is no manipulation,
there is no forcing

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.360
and those who want to stay
and work it out are allowed,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.120
but those who don’t want
are asked to get out.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.880
There is no half way because
you have to grow,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.000
just like a little plant
has to become the tree,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.280
a Sahaja yogi has to become
a real ardent Sahaja yogi,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:04.040
but he leads a life, not of an acidity,
but would be married, have children,

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:13.960
have a very, very normal life.
The best thing would be to ask

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:21.840
the Sahaja yogis themselves what they feel
because they are absolutely free people.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:32.600
It is their feeling of joy
that makes them committed to Sahaja yoga.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:37.400
They want to share it, like a drunkard
wants to share his drink with others.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:43.360
In the same way, those who are drunk
in the nectar of God’s love,

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.960
want to share it and that’s how
they have committed.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:54.040
But for that they don’t have to give
any money and give up any family life.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:27:00.240
They have to be very normal people.
And they become extremely normal.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:08.680
They drop out all their idiosyncrasies.
They drop out all their funny habits

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:16.810
and become very dignified, very intelligent,
understanding, wise, Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:23.240
Interviewer: Thank you, cut it.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.600
Interviewer: And Wolfgang says, I could
feel my chakras and the chakras of others

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.720
on my fingertips and now we come
to something for you to record.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.080
Would you want to talk about
when you become collectively conscious,

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.589
you enter the Kingdom of God,
you become a peer?

00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:35.382
Cameraman: Oh, sorry.

00:27:35.382 --> 00:27:47.800
Shri Mataji: That I’ve already said it.
But when you become collectively conscious…

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.498
Interviewer: Yes, yes you did say that.

00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:52.563
Shri Mataji: I can say that when you
become collectively conscious

00:27:52.563 --> 00:27:52.607
then you can feel others on your fingertips.

00:27:52.607 --> 00:27:55.160
Interviewer: Right, yes, yes – I mean
it’d be nice if you could say it again.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.040
Cameraman: Okay, so Nick in five.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.000
Interviewer: Okay.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.520
Technician: Take one, scene 29.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:10.200
Interviewer: There’s no, actually
there’s no question really,

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.480
because this is just going to follow
straight on after someone’s saying,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.280
I could feel my chakras and the chakras
of others on my fingertips.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:23.116
So if you could tell us about
feeling the chakras please.

00:28:23.116 --> 00:28:23.147
Shri Mataji: What should I say?

00:28:23.147 --> 00:28:27.867
Interviewer: About becoming
collectively conscious.

00:28:27.867 --> 00:28:32.080
Shri Mataji: Ah, as a result of this,
a new dimension of awareness

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:41.080
dawns on your central nervous system.
And you become collectively conscious,

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:48.600
means you can feel the chakras
of other people on your fingertips.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:57.200
Also it means that a microcosm
now has the feeling of the microcosm.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.560
That is, a small little drop
has now become an ocean

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:11.160
or you can say that now you can feel
a part and parcel of the Virat.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.160
You can feel it. There is no question
of mental understanding,

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:21.860
you just feel it on your fingertips
because who is the other there?

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:27.307
Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Cut it.

00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:30.100
Shri Mataji: Why do Sahaja Yogis
call it as Mahayoga?

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.773
Technician: Take two, scene 13. Rolling.

00:29:35.773 --> 00:29:36.548
Cameraman: It’s actually take one, scene 13.

00:29:36.548 --> 00:29:37.400
Technician: Sorry.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.930
Cameraman: Okay in five.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.640
Interviewer: Shri Mataji, why do
Sahaja Yogis call this Mahayoga?

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:55.240
Shri Mataji: You see, they have realised
that Sahaja Yoga of present day

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:04.960
is very much wider, subtler
than the Sahaja Yoga that was practised

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:13.280
since long in our country.
Now, a person who becomes a Sahaja Yogi

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:19.240
can feel the centers on his fingertips
of other people,

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:27.960
he can give realisations to others,
he can understand that Kundalini will only rise

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:39.280
when you cleanse your chakras
by understanding that all those great

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:50.080
incarnations and the great saints.
We can say all the great prophets

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:57.480
who came on this earth
and who created these great religions,

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:11.840
are within us! And that all of them are
part and parcel of our being.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:17.920
And they are like milestones
of our progress in our evolution.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.560
And when they raise the Kundalini
and it stops at a particular center

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.520
they have to take the name
of that particular prophet

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.960
or a particular incarnation
then only the Kundalini moves.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:40.440
So it is not mental but through experience
and experiments they have realised

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:50.080
that all the religions which were created
were flowers of the same tree.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:32:03.160
And human beings have plucked them,
made them dead and are using them as their own.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:08.120
They are dead flowers and that’s why
all the problem.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:18.840
These are all man made religions.
So it is called as Mahayoga

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:31.880
because it integrates all the scriptures
all the prophecies, all the religions,

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:37.880
in their essence. Because the essence
of all the religion is one

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:48.040
that seek the eternal and transitory
to be treated in its own limitations

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:55.040
and understanding.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.120
We don’t have to preach
that all religions are the same,

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.400
we are our brothers and sisters
and then we just start fighting.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.040
It just becomes part and parcel
of your being, you just know that

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:13.840
every religion is absolutely born
on the same tree of life.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:20.240
So we have Jews who worship Christ,
we have Christians who worship Krishna,

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.440
we have Muslims who worship Rama.
So we have all sorts of people

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:34.240
who are of that level that from that height
they see that all these rivers

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:42.600
are flowing into one ocean
and from the same ocean,

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:55.080
the vapours of spirituality have risen
and have brought the clouds of spirituality

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:04.780
and again they are pouring down
as pure vibrations on human beings.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:16.720
Interviewer: Right, cut that please. 43,
well, it ends up, it is such a wonderful

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.000
centre you have got, this is what you
already said, which has got four petals

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.040
which looks after the pelvic plexus.
And now we need to have you continue

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.537
our magnetism, Shri Ganesha,
because you talked about…

00:34:27.537 --> 00:34:27.560
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.120
Interviewer:…the birds finding their way,
Shri Ganesha and Chastity were the

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.785
three things you wanted to add about.

00:34:32.785 --> 00:34:37.749
Shri Mataji: I see. This is the center,
but I’ll just put it on.

00:34:37.749 --> 00:34:39.400
Cameraman: We are okay.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:39.829
Interviewer: Are running?

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:40.540
Cameraman: Yes, we can start.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.360
Technician: Take one, scene 43.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:54.960
Shri Mataji: Now, this is the center,
surprisingly, is the most important one,

00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.280
because this was the first center
created as in the universe.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:08.720
The first thing that was created
was purity, innocence.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:18.120
And this is the center of innocence.
And the special thing about innocence is

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.080
that whatever you may try,
whatever you may do,

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:27.320
whatever sins you may commit,
this innocence can be clouded,

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.640
but cannot be destroyed.
This is a very good advantage

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:40.960
that this power of innocence is always
readily available when you awaken

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:50.400
the Kundalini of people.
So everybody can get realisation.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.040
Now this center has got four petals,
and in details I have given

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.720
many lectures about it.
But what is to be understood

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:08.720
that innocence is the most important quality,
and that’s why,

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:14.520
whether it’s a woman or a man,
the chastity is to be worshipped

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.560
and to be respected.
There were people like Freud

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:27.560
who were half-baked, and they are the ones
who have brought aids and all these experiments.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.280
Because whatever human beings have,&nbsp;

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.080
they think they have every&nbsp;
right to experiment with.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.960
But this way has proved
to be extremely dangerous.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:45.640
People are now suffering from
all kinds of problems all over.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:54.360
It may be that it was not their mistake,
but definitely it was their ignorance.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:03.320
So one has to decry it and stop it.
I told about this long time back.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.400
In America that such and such
disease will come.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:16.360
Even today people think no end of Freud
and still are not understanding

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:22.000
what are they after.
We are not a sex point.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:32.600
We have to become a super human being,
a saint. So to reduce yourself to a sex point

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:41.840
or to learn something from
animals’ sex behaviour is nonsense.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:48.240
Because we have freedom,
we should not go into abandonment

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:54.200
and know that in no religion
it is being preached

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.440
that you can play with your innocence.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:04.483
Interviewer: Witness.

00:38:04.483 --> 00:38:06.160
Shri&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.940
Mataji: Witness is all right,
doesn’t matter. It’s all right.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:13.040
Interviewer: And then you had the idea
of people being in the water and being,

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.960
talking about them coming out
of the water into the boat

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.920
and having a picture of people
in the water and getting into a boat

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.947
and feeling better. That was something to…

00:38:20.947 --> 00:38:25.197
Shri Mataji: In the boat they should say,
”Help, help, help”.

00:38:25.197 --> 00:38:25.227
Cameraman: Okay, five seconds.

00:38:25.227 --> 00:38:26.340
Shri Mataji: If you are in the water…

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.440
Technician: Take one, scene 15.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.787
Cameraman: I’m sorry Shri Mataji,
can we start again?

00:38:28.787 --> 00:38:35.080
Shri Mataji: So sorry.
If you are in the water,

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:40.480
you are afraid of the waves
because you don’t know how to swim.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:49.200
But if you are put in a boat
then you can see the waves and you enjoy them.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.600
But supposing you know swimming,
then you can swim and save other people.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.440
So this is the state you achieve.&nbsp;

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.200
Like in a car, we have an accelerator

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:13.720
and also a brake. So in the beginning
we have to learn how to manage these two.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.720
Once we have got that balance,
we become a driver.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:21.040
But still the master is sitting behind.
But once you get realisation,

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:30.760
you become the master. And you see
the driver, the brake and the accelerator

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:36.860
and you control it completely.
You’re completely in control with yourself.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:43.902
Interviewer: Okay cut it.

00:39:43.902 --> 00:39:43.920
Shri Mataji: Done?

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:43.982
Technician: Take one, scene…

00:39:43.982 --> 00:39:44.560
Shri Mataji: What I am to say?

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.760
Interviewer: About the Kundalini being our
own Mother, our individual Mother,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.320
guiding our ascent and then
how Adi Shankaracharya describes her.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.320
Technician: Take one, scene 54.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.560
Shri Mataji: Kundalini is our
individual Mother.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:10.480
And as your Mother took all the pains
upon herself while giving you realisation,

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.080
she looks after you
and you don’t feel anything.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.960
Now the awakening of Kundalini
and its manifestation

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.080
has been described by many saints,
especially in India,

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:35.760
like Kabira, Ganeshvara,
has clearly talked about it.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:44.560
But above all, we should say
Shri Adi Shankaracharya

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:52.040
has beautifully described it.
Though we had Markandeya and other people

00:40:52.040 --> 00:41:00.920
who have also very beautifully
given information about that.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:11.680
But Adi Shankaracharya’s poetry is beautiful.
Same with Ganeshvara,

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:22.480
who was a young person who died very early.
And who has beautifully described

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:32.240
how Kundalini looks like, how She works,
in the sixth chapter of his book

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.240
called as Ganeshwari.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:47.320
Interviewer: So, right, cut it for a minute,
because you…maybe we can separate them

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.627
if you like.

00:41:48.627 --> 00:41:50.620
Shri Mataji: Same thing, I can say it
all that, just now.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.960
Interviewer: And this is the time,
the last judgement and resurrection,

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.720
the new Satya-yuga age, prophesied
in all the world, great religions.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.160
The world is not to be destroyed.
Would God who loves us very much

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.307
give us doomsday and not the resurrection?

00:42:02.307 --> 00:42:06.360
Shri Mataji: I think at this point,
you stop. Is better.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.120
The film should stop at this point.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.383
Interviewer: Ah, Because we’ve got…

00:42:10.383 --> 00:42:16.708
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right.
Perfect, all right.

00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:21.200
Technician: Take one scene 59 and 60.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.320
Interviewer: Ready?

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.827
Cameraman: Yep.

00:42:25.827 --> 00:42:30.960
Shri Mataji: I already called it
as the blossom time.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.320
That means there are so many flowers
on the tree of life

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.360
who are about to become fruits
and have become fruits.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:45.360
So the modern times you are called
as Kali Yuga have now, come to an end

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.880
and a new age has started
which is called as Krita Yuga.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.720
When the All-pervading star power
starts working it out

00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:02.200
is a Krita Yuga that has also started.
Which will end up into Satya yoga

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:09.240
means the age of truth. So in this
Krita Yuga this All-pervading power

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.680
is going to work out miracles.
It is going to work out

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:20.120
the Kundalini awakening.
It is going to give signs, of its existence.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:26.800
It is going to help people
to bring about political changes

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:35.520
and also mental attitudes will change.
So many things it is going to work out.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:43.440
That’s why it is called as Krita Yuga
where it will work out.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:54.880
The blossom time is working out
and this is the time what we can call

00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:00.920
as the last judgement. The last judgement
where people will be judged

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:06.040
through their own Kundalini.
You must have seen the picture

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:16.720
of Sistine Chapel Done by Michael Angelo
and that’s exactly is the Kundalini

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.280
where they have shown Christ
standing at Angya chakra.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:27.040
This is the Last Judgement, or in the Quran
it is described as the resurrection time,

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:43.560
it’s Kiyama, as they have Sya in chapter
where it is described all about this Kruta yuga.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:52.280
So this Kruta yuga is the special time
of judgement, and after the judgement

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:57.040
the Satya yoga will come
where the people who have known the truth

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:07.480
have felt it on their central nervous system,
will be in charge of this world

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:14.760
and this humanity. This is what
is going to happen in the future.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:23.480
Whatever is described by Bhagavani
is already happening

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:30.760
and the way there are so many
political changes taking place

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:40.160
so dramatically and so fast.
One should expect a very beautiful world

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:49.040
by the end of this century
of people who feel each other,

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:55.080
love each other and who abide
in the Kingdom of God

00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:11.247
with the discipline of Ramaraj.

00:46:11.247 --> 00:46:11.267
Interviewer: Cut it.

00:46:11.267 --> 00:46:15.520
Shri Mataji: This will, when will you
ask this question? At the end of it?

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.560
Interviewer: I don’t know yet,
I think we’ll have to find,

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.107
to see when it is all together.
Where it best goes in.

00:46:22.107 --> 00:46:23.007
Shri Mataji: Just before the end.

00:46:23.007 --> 00:46:23.034
Interviewer: Yes, probably.

00:46:23.034 --> 00:46:23.067
Shri Mataji: Just before the end.

00:46:23.067 --> 00:46:26.247
Interviewer: It’s like a climax.

00:46:26.247 --> 00:46:26.263
Shri Mataji: Oh.

00:46:26.263 --> 00:46:26.920
Interviewer: Are we rolling?

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:27.667
Technician: We are rolling.

00:46:27.667 --> 00:46:30.120
Interviewer: Better call this 68a
at the moment.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.840
Technician: Take one, 68a.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.920
Interviewer: Okay…
