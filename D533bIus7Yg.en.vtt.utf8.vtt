00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:26.260
Dr. Warren has already talked to you about
the different centers that we have within

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:35.879
ourselves, and you can see how beautifully
they are placed and how gradually when the

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:44.579
Kundalini rises, how She enlightens the innermost
core of the centers.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:01:02.059
There are three channels in the central channel,
and the innermost channel is used by Kundalini

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.190
to pierce through for the first time.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:19.632
You can imagine Kundalini to be made of many
strands of energy tied together just like

00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:34.850
a rope, and as the chakras start opening more
strands start getting awakened and they pierce

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:46.579
through these six centers; but if a person
after Realization just thinks that he has

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.200
got the Realization, then he doesn't have
to bother about it, may lose it for the time

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.890
being, for quite some time I should say, and
he'll have to work much harder to re-establish

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.109
his Self Realization.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:14.590
I've seen many-a-times when we give Realization
to people they say, "Yes, we have felt it."

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.299
They did feel it, everything happens, and
then they loose it because they have not established

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.599
their Realization properly, for which luckily
in every place wherever I go I see to it that

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:41.610
we already have a center established, then
you can go to that center and you can learn

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.780
from them how to establish your Realization.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.260
That is a very, very important time which
must be taken into consideration.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.050
There was a lady who had cancer, she was cured
of her cancer, she was perfectly all right

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:13.830
and she went back to her family, she was doing
very well, and after some time - a year or

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.060
so - she came back with another disease of
a very serious nature.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.860
So I asked her, "How is it that you are cured
of cancer, now you get another disease?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.370
Did you do anything about it?"

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.099
"No, Mother, I went back from here, everybody
says, 'You are looking very fine.'

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.220
They are all right, they were all quite surprised
how I was cured, and I never bothered to do

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.329
anything about it."

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.780
So she got another trouble.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.090
You go on like this, you cure one thing then
you again cure another thing.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:00.150
Like little children, you clean them, then
again they get out and soil their clothes,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.030
again they are back in the bathroom, then
again you clean them, again they do the same

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.200
thing.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.540
So you have to mature, after Realization you
must in all wisdom and sensible behavior,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.220
you must mature of it, otherwise it is a big
headache to Me and big headache to you, and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.870
you can be quite lost also with it, because
if a seed is half-sprouted it is of no use

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.560
at all.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.350
So if you want that you should really have
the complete bliss of Self Realization, you

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.100
have to become a little serious person about
it.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.910
Shallow temperament is not going to help you,
or looking at it as if like another guru shopping

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.110
business it is not going to work out.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.900
You have to work to see that you establish
yourself, till you have established you are

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.660
not to work on other people but once you are
established you can start working on other

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.920
people, giving them Realization.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:12.160
There is no need then for you to bother that
you will catch from others, or anything; but

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.510
before that you should not try to help others.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.110
First help yourself, selfishness to begin
with.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.600
Unless and until you are all right and you
know all the methods of protecting yourself,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:34.340
you are not to indulge into Sahaja Yoga practices
which helps others.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.340
But when you become an expert, when you have
an expertise then you should do it.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.360
Like a mechanic who doesn't know how to repair
a car, they spoil it more.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.130
So better become an expert for which you don't
have to pay anything, you don't have to do

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.400
much about it but only to understand how you
have to move the Kundalini within you, how

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:05.190
you have to establish it back, what problems
you have and how you have to cure.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.180
You will be surprised you won't be aware of
problems that you have.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.940
One gentleman came and told Me, "Mother everyone
is coming and asking me, 'what about your

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.270
father, what's the problem?'"

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.270
I said, "Everybody said the same?"

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.560
He said, "Yes."

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.290
I said, "I also want to know, what about your
father?"

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:30.290
He said, "My father died very early in life,
and I always had a feeling that I had no father."

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.690
That can be cured, and he developed asthma
with it, so everybody knows, those who know

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.030
one thing that is the truth about you.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.541
All of them will say the same thing, even
if it is a small child, he will also come

00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:49.280
and ask you that "Is your father all right?"

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.960
Because if he knows that this center, this
center on the right hand side means the father.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.270
So he will also say the same and then he will
come and ask you, "what about your father?"

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:09.690
It is so remarkable sometimes the way people
see these things that they can't believe it,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:15.370
but this is nothing, what you get is just
a wee bit of it.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:22.240
But as Kundalini rises, on every center you
start getting the light of that center.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:32.820
At the first center you get back your innocence,
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:39.550
innocent, you are not filled with lust and
greed, you don't look at things with lust

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.400
and greed, but you look at things with innocence,
which is a very big thing that people have

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:52.530
lost and that you get back and such a person
develops many qualities.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:08:00.620
One of them is that such a person is full
of fragrance, such a person has a tremendous

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:11.990
gravity, tremendous gravity, and such a person
has tremendous dynamism, and attraction is

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.720
a bad word so I don't want to use it, but
magnetical.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:25.770
His magnets is awakened within him, this is
the center of your magnet of the earth.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:33.919
Such a person develops a tremendous sense
of roots and sense of direction, you place

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.930
him anywhere he will know where to go.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:41.580
Like birds, you place birds anywhere they
know which side is north, south, east, west.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:51.091
In the same way you also develop your lost
innocence and your magnet within you by which

00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:58.180
you have proper direction; but the highest
of all you develop the proper direction to

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.870
wisdom which is the wise thing to do.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:08.832
You just don't do stupid things, you just
don't do, even if you ever try to do it, you

00:09:08.832 --> 00:09:14.560
will not do it, because you know it is so
stupid, just you don't do it.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:22.200
I mean it is so simple to be wise than to
be stupid, because if you have to be stupid

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:30.170
you have to go out of the way to be stupid
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.400
and wise is the easiest thing to do.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:42.340
But what people do is to do things that would
make them more and more stupid, nonsensical,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:50.920
because also some people told Me they do it,
the reason being they think they have a nuisance

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920
value.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.100
Like in London now we have one funny stuff
going on, they call it what?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.100
"Punk rock."

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.950
You see, it's a funny stuff.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:05.510
Now poor kids they don't know what they are
doing it, and I think the only value of that

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:16.460
punk rock system is this: that they try to
sort of make a nuisance out of them so that

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.360
people feel attracted towards them or sort
of a significance out of them.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.760
But when you become a realized soul you realize
your significance, because you understand

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:36.620
you are part and parcel of the whole and that
your significance is to give Realization to

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.380
others, the highest of highest, that's what
you have to do now you are a saint, and that's

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:52.130
how the whole attitude of cheapiness, of outward
shallowness finishes and you become a serene,

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.300
dignified personality.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:11:00.550
This is not possible through any sermon, any
lecture, it's only possible when the Kundalini

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:08.820
rises you become like a very dignified child,
very dignified child.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:17.650
I've seen one beautiful painting done of Mother
Mary being taught first time.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:23.990
You see Her as a child, She is a very dignified
personality, as a child, She is about ten

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.030
years of age.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:31.000
I've seen My own grandchildren who are not
very old but extremely dignified.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.640
They walk like kings, behave like kings.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.680
In every behavior you find there's such a
dignity, they'll never do something shallow,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.420
they never ask for anything, they never weep
for anything, they never cry for anything,

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:49.680
they are so dignified and they understand
it so well what is dignity is.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.810
I don't have to tell them, because they are
born realized, in the same way you become,

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.780
nobody has to tell you that "do this, or do
that," but you understand that you must have

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.760
self-respect.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.240
This happens to you automatically, this is
actualization, nobody has to tell you that

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.850
"you be dignified," you just become.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:15.670
I've seen people who were absolutely absurd,
even from this punk rock we got some people

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.850
and they were so changed that people could
not recognize them, but one thing bad has

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:26.940
happened with this punk rock that they put
some sort of dye in their head and since then

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:32.860
their eyes became very weak, because these
dyes I think made the optic globe covered

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:39.630
with some sort of a color and you can't see
properly, and the eyes became very weak and

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:45.360
it took some time for us to remove the effect
of those dyes from their head.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.360
We go headlong, "what's wrong?"

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.740
There is nothing wrong in this world if it
is a stupid fool, but for a wise man there

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:59.250
are very many things which are absolutely
wrong, and there are very many things which

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:05.370
are absolutely correct, so you develop your
wisdom by this first center.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:12.860
Now as the Kundalini rises She enlightens
your second center which we can call as the

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.360
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though
it is the third center.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.830
But second center, you become extremely creative,
extremely creative.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:27.279
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had
no job.

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:30.400
And he said, "Mother, I have no job and what
should I do?"

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.710
I said, "All right, what do you want to do?"

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.240
He said, "Whatever you say."

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.240
I said, "All right, why don't you become an
interior decorator?"

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.550
He said, "Me?

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.501
I don't know what is a teak wood, I don't
know what is a rose wood, how am I to become

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:44.580
an interior decorator?"

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.279
I said, "You just use your vibrations."

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:52.440
And you'll be surprised he earned million
of rupees out of that profession because you

00:13:52.440 --> 00:14:00.990
become extremely creative, your sense of creation
becomes so subtle and so beautiful that you

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:07.089
start understanding art at such a high level
that people don't know how, when you are not

00:14:07.089 --> 00:14:10.170
educated in art, how you can do it.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:15.170
I went to Japan once, and they were having
an Ikebana competition or something, so I

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:21.330
went to see the Ikebana class and they requested
Me, "Why don't you do some flower arrangements?"

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.640
I said, "All right, I'll do."

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:28.930
I did it and I got the highest marks without
knowing a word about Ikebana, just surprise

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.360
Me, I got the highest mark.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.370
I can do lots of things which I've never done
before like architecture.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:41.680
I have built houses without doing any architecture,
I've done decorations of the houses, I've

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.330
done all kinds of things without knowing how
to it, because you become you so creative.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.120
Music you start understanding so much better.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.570
There are people now in America, there's a
girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice, absolutely

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.340
hoarse voice, and she always used to go out
of tune.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.950
So I told her, "You shouldn't sing songs before
Me because it's rather funny."

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.050
She said, "Mother, why don't You give me a
good voice?"

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:13.770
I said, "You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.420
be all right."

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.610
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don't you sit
down.]

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:27.540
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was ... she tried
on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations, and

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.970
she sings so melodiously now that I tell you
she can be a great singer.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:41.040
So the creativity, that also is a blessing
of your power of the Goddess of learning.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.370
Boys who could not study in the schools were
absolutely duffers.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.480
Some people brought this boy, recently I've
received a letter from him.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.330
When he came to Me, his father said that "He
is going to be taken out of school because

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.270
he's good for nothing, he can not remember
anything, he's absolutely finished."

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.810
I said, "All right, doesn't matter, let him
take to Sahaja Yoga."

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.740
He got his Realization.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.580
Not only that he passed with first class,
but he got a scholarship.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.360
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.750
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young
age.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:22.709
He wrote to Me, "Mother no one can believe
that a duffer like me has been so much highly

00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:23.830
placed."

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:30.930
All the boys who got scholarships in Maharashtra
in schools, in colleges and universities are

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.550
Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:39.070
It is such a tremendous force that starts
working in you, if you try to give vibrations

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:51.470
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat
and such things which are very important for

00:16:51.470 --> 00:17:00.250
life, any food, you will be amazed that the
food also grows so much more and the taste

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.690
is so good and it lasts you so longer.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:11.540
Like one gentleman tried, a university professor
in agricultural college on some wheat, some

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:17.659
vibrations and he was amazed that when they
collected this wheat it was at least six times

00:17:17.659 --> 00:17:25.919
more than normal, and when this wheat was
stored in a big hall like this, there were

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:33.990
so many other things, the rats who are always
a menace in India never touched that wheat.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.970
They ate all the rest of it but never touched
the wheat.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:45.980
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers,
of course the dogs and the cats - understand

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.480
it much more, they understand you, they know
that you are a saint.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.669
They'll never touch you, they will never trouble
you.

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:56.299
Even a tiger sees a saint, he never attacks.

00:17:56.299 --> 00:18:00.450
You can handle a tiger very easily; this is
the power of a saint.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.100
So you develop a tremendous capacity of creativity.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:14.019
The greatest capacity you have then is of
creating a new human being out of a ordinary

00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:15.019
human being.

00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:21.970
This is the greatest blessing that you have,
that you transform an egg into a bird and

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:28.450
that is the epitome, that is the spiritual
power you have, by which you can transform

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:37.700
the whole human race into a new race which
has this fifth dimension within yourself.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.999
You can start talking on science now, we have
a scientist here and he's a done his science,

00:18:42.999 --> 00:18:48.190
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that,
in chemistry and I explained to him about

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:53.070
this - where is the hydrogen and oxygen and
nitrogen and all that within us and he was

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.070
amazed.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.309
He said, "Mother, how do you know all these
things?"

00:18:56.309 --> 00:18:59.899
I said, "I don't know how I know, but I know.

00:18:59.899 --> 00:19:02.400
That's what it is, you just have a look at
this."

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.340
And he was amazed how I was telling him about
spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.489
He said that "For this I had to study so much."

00:19:10.489 --> 00:19:12.419
I said, "For Sahaja Yog you don't have to
study."

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:15.870
A little bit you know and immediately you
click the point.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:21.220
Now this is the second thing that you know
in your learnings, in your education you are

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:27.499
all right, but the mastery of this center
comes, the mastery of this center comes when

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:34.799
you know the pure knowledge, the pure knowledge
of handling the Kundalini, the pure knowledge

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:40.400
of Spirit, the pure knowledge of the blessings
of God, of Ritambhara Pragya.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.940
If you know that, that is the highest that
you achieve gradually as you grow, because

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:54.369
when these centers starts expanding on the
sides, you start expanding in your personality,

00:19:54.369 --> 00:20:01.840
in your sensitivity and in your evolutionary
ascent, so that is how you start growing from

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.730
one to another to another to another.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:10.659
Now the third center that we have actually,
this is the second center because the third

00:20:10.659 --> 00:20:18.899
center arises, this Swadishthana arises out
of the Nabhi, is a very, very important center,

00:20:18.899 --> 00:20:22.890
is the center of your seeking as he has told
you.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:30.299
Your compete priorities change, complete priorities
change, because the joy that you get out of

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:39.429
Sahaja Yoga, the joy you get out of this meditation,
out of the feeling that grows in you all the

00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:48.840
time, like a beautiful torrential rain of
joy that fills you, your life and everybody's

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:55.100
life, you don't care for cheap type of entertainment.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.970
You feel, you seek other Sahaja Yogi, you
want to meet another Sahaja Yogi, you don't

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.210
want to meet anybody else.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:06.840
If there is an actor coming, or some big man
is coming, "All right, let him come, I'm going

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.029
to see such and such person."

00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:16.859
It is such a different personality that one
day - I will tell you how it happens - there

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:21.090
was a girl, a diplomat, she's a diplomat who
is a realized soul and she happened to go

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.720
to Sicily.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.549
And she was eating her food, suddenly she
felt there is some vibrations coming down,

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:32.120
she looked around, the other one was also
looking at her, she said, "Are you Mataji's

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.120
disciple?"

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.929
And she said, "Yes, I am Mataji's child."

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:43.109
They both got up and just hugged and said,
"Such joy Mother in that far-fetched place

00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:45.609
of Sicily to find a Sahaja Yogi."

00:21:45.609 --> 00:21:50.060
And then they stayed together and they wouldn't
go anywhere else but they said, "Now this

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.480
is the enjoyment."

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.100
Just the company of a Sahaja Yogi is such
an enjoyment.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.769
I've seen these people when they go to India,
the people are not so rich, poor people - they

00:22:00.769 --> 00:22:04.490
have little, little huts - but when they go
they go there, you should see the love, the

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:10.692
rapport, and that makes Me so happy, so happy,
the way they love each other, the way they

00:22:10.692 --> 00:22:18.539
understand each other, the way they help each
other and the only the company, for the first

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:20.340
time they start enjoying.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:26.749
We were once in a hotel staying in Calcutta
and with two Sahaja Yogi with Me.

00:22:26.749 --> 00:22:31.220
They were in the other room, quite far away,
they could not get a room close to Me, and

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:36.370
one gentleman came for his Realization, he
came to My feet, when he got his Realization

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.940
it was a tremendous happening and they came
rushing from there.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.610
I said, "What happened?"

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.780
They said, "We felt the vibrations, we felt
the vibrations from there, Mother, so we have

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.159
come to receive the vibrations."

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:52.100
And they came and they felt the vibrations.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:58.619
So this man was so great that his vibrations
attracted them and they came down.

00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:05.239
They were just enjoying that as if they were
enjoying a big flower with lots of fragrance.

00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:07.080
What vibrations, what vibrations!

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.909
The fellow got up and said, "Very nice.

00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:13.820
They are enjoying my vibrations.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.899
Now I'm going to enjoy your vibrations."

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:25.879
For the first time you start enjoying your
fellow man because everyone is a beautiful

00:23:25.879 --> 00:23:30.889
personality, a glorious, fragrant, joyful
personality; but because you cannot feel the

00:23:30.889 --> 00:23:36.100
other person, and because the other person
does not emit, you are all the time quarreling.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.929
Even husband-wife quarreling, father-mother
quarreling, this one quarreling, that quarreling.

00:23:39.929 --> 00:23:44.460
In Sahaja Yoga there is hardly any time for
people to quarrel.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.190
The other day I had a lady who came to see
Me, and she was trying to put her point and

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:55.279
there were about five-six Sahaja Yogis, and
everybody was putting the same point and she

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:56.279
was amazed.

00:23:56.279 --> 00:24:02.259
She said, "I've never seen such concord, such
friendship, such understanding, all of them

00:24:02.259 --> 00:24:07.279
supporting each other, nobody is cutting anyone."

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.230
Such a society has to develop.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:17.440
It's such a nourishing, soothing, invigorating
society, and you forget about getting bored,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:23.620
boredom goes out of life, you never get bored,
you enjoy yourself or you enjoy the company

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:30.009
of Sahaja Yogis and it is very different level
that you come of - that is what, that land

00:24:30.009 --> 00:24:32.669
you have to reach within yourself.

00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:39.990
Now the greatest thing that happens as a result
of this center seeking, that you start seeking

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.529
other seekers, you try to find out "where
is the seeker?"

00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:48.520
If you hear somebody is a seeker, you go and
see.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:53.460
If you hear about someone that some people
are lost there, they were seekers, but they

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.779
went there lost, you all rush there.

00:24:55.779 --> 00:25:04.259
It is like a person who is like a, what you
call a guard on the seashore you know, there

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:09.080
are guards kept for salvaging people, and
that is how you become.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.869
You suddenly see somebody sinking, you just
go.

00:25:11.869 --> 00:25:17.250
In Bombay there was a case they announce that
"there's a lady who is going to die, if somebody

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.869
can come and help her, it will be a great
thing."

00:25:19.869 --> 00:25:23.700
They all rushed there; they saved her.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:29.570
Now the interests changes completely, and
you start really helping people and not feeling

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:35.090
that you are helping them, not at all.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:40.570
But the surrounding portion of that, which
is the void, is the best, which is affected

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:47.359
by your awakening, that you become the virtue
itself.

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:55.970
Nobody has to tell you that you be virtuous,
when you are awakened you become a virtuous

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:06.239
person, you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy
being good, you enjoy being nice, you really

00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:07.700
enjoy it.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:14.419
And that enjoyment comes to you as a blessing
because the virtue itself is so strengthening,

00:26:14.419 --> 00:26:26.350
so powerful that anyone who is harmed or troubled
or tortured or put down, you stand up, you

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:31.630
are not afraid of anyone, you are not afraid
of any one of them.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:39.100
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:45.600
I'm just a lady and single-handed I told them
who these people are, how they are going to

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.529
loot you, and what they are going to do; but
in this country nobody can think of one genuine

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:54.580
person who could be really genuine.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:27:02.359
It was the problem that time, but with this
awakening within you of the virtuous nature,

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:04.679
you just know what is virtue and what is not
virtue.

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:09.249
I don't have to tell you; I don't say "don't
do this, don't do that."

00:27:09.249 --> 00:27:16.871
I never say that, it just happens, because
when the virtue starts developing, the vibrations

00:27:16.871 --> 00:27:20.669
improve and you feel extremely joyous.

00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:30.220
We have lost our virtues because there is
no joy out of it, no reward.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:34.940
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer; if
somebody's good, he has to suffer; is somebody's

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.639
kind, he thinks he has to suffer; but after
getting Realization you are rewarded for your

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:41.639
virtues.

00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:48.970
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it's
so surprising, like once there was a lady

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:54.080
who came to see Me, she was a refugee, and
I had a big house.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.389
So I said, "All right come and stay with Me."

00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:59.220
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, "What's this?

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.409
You don't know her, who she is, her husband,
whether he is her husband or not, just given

00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:04.809
her two rooms.

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:06.210
It's not good!"

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.210
I said, "Let it be, doesn't matter.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.289
I know for nothing is going to happen, let
her be here."

00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:11.059
So they wouldn't also go against Me.

00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:12.809
They said, "All right, if you say so."

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:15.190
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:20.309
Then she become a very well-known actress
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady,

00:28:20.309 --> 00:28:22.820
but somebody told Me that she is the same
lady.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.859
I said, "Maybe."

00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:28.051
Then one day you see, they wanted to make
a film for our Sahaja Yoga, so they said,

00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:32.119
"We can ask this lady to act, because she
is a good actress."

00:28:32.119 --> 00:28:36.499
I said, "All right, you can go ask but don't
tell her I am here, otherwise she will have

00:28:36.499 --> 00:28:37.499
no choice.

00:28:37.499 --> 00:28:38.799
I will not go and see her.

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:39.799
You just ask her."

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:42.940
They went and ask her, they said, "Will you
be actress?" and all that.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.940
She said, "I'll try."

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.940
This, that she was saying.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.720
But on the day on when they were going to
open the film I went there, she saw Me, she

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.099
was so amazed, she said, "Oh God, You are
the One, You are the One Who is sponsoring

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.109
this, Oh, I'll give my life for Her!"

00:28:56.109 --> 00:29:00.200
She just came forward, she said, "Have anything
you like, I have nothing to say, I am so sorry

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.960
that you never told me that She's there."

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:09.470
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:15.759
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person and so many people become

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:17.279
your friends in this world.

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:21.909
Your have to just tell you are coming, there
will hundred people at the airport to receive

00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:22.909
you.

00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:26.539
There will be so many friends all over the
world for you, you will be amazed.

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:31.999
It's such a tremendous thing happens, because
now you all are awakened in that Primordial

00:29:31.999 --> 00:29:35.190
Being and you have become one with each other.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:40.559
You can feel it, that oneness, that unison
that we are all not only human beings but

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:45.190
we are yogis, we are super human beings, and
we have to look after the whole world.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:52.849
That feeling of compassion is so overwhelming
that all little, little stupid things just

00:29:52.849 --> 00:29:56.659
fall off, there's no place for that.

00:29:56.659 --> 00:29:59.419
This actually happens and has happened with
many.

00:29:59.419 --> 00:30:04.200
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories, but

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.940
there are many, some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome, some them

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.509
used to fight so much in the beginning that
I thought, "How are they going to be all right?"

00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:19.340
But today I find them as great friends and
very great yogis.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.320
So this is the center where your religion
is awakened.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.730
And what is a religion?

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.999
Word comes from "religo," in Sanskrit it means
dharma, "Dhariyatisa Dharma," the sustenance,

00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:34.340
your sustenance, your valances is your religion.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:40.150
As every atom, carbon has four valances, and
in the same way you have ten valances, these

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:47.659
are the ten commandments that were told to
you and you become that, you just become.

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:53.830
I don't have to tell you as commandments but
they become your beautiful ornaments within

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:54.830
yourself.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:59.369
This happens automatically, so spontaneously
you become that.

00:30:59.369 --> 00:31:04.559
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother.

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:10.630
He came to see Me, and he was rather adamant
and little angry when he came to see Me because

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.450
he thought, "Why am I trying to do this kind
of thing?"

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:18.440
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
"I'm amazed, you know, I've been giving lectures

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.249
in the church for years together, but I could
not achieve anything.

00:31:23.249 --> 00:31:25.919
How have You transformed these people?

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:31.519
The drug addicts have suddenly become such
good people that they have given up drugs,

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:33.159
alcoholics have given up alcohol.

00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:35.960
How is it without telling them anything?"

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.289
I said, "Everything is within them.

00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:41.700
As soon as the light comes you can see everything.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.499
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress, this is anti-life,

00:31:45.499 --> 00:31:46.789
you just give up.

00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:49.769
Only thing you have to have the light within
you."

00:31:49.769 --> 00:31:56.409
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said, "Really, that should be done, is

00:31:56.409 --> 00:31:57.409
to transform them."

00:31:57.409 --> 00:32:02.259
But I said, "You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons, you transform them

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:06.969
by giving them the real second birth, real
baptism."

00:32:06.969 --> 00:32:12.940
And I must say that Calvinist, of all the
persons, Calvinist in Geneva have accepted

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.019
Me and they think that this is the only way
they can transform you.

00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:24.109
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:31.830
people, they have accepted to see the result
of everybody who is open-minded person, who

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.450
thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.729
We'll see one day that this is the way it
has to be.

00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:45.169
God has given us this power, we have got a
Spirit within us, we should try to awaken

00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:50.710
that and we should accept it, not because
I'm doing it, you can do it also.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:54.590
So this thing happens to you with this chakra.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:59.570
Now with the another chakra on top, that is
one - as he has told the diseases, I'm telling

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:05.690
you the positive side of it - when this chakra
is caught up he must have told you, you develop

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.129
breast cancer and all that.

00:33:07.129 --> 00:33:15.660
But when it is awakened, you get all the security
of the world, you are never insecure, you

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:22.279
are never bothered, you have no fear of anyone.

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:26.269
You do not have to suggest yourself that "you
should not have fear or anything," you just

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:34.090
become fearless, there is no nothing like
fear, there's no reaction to any threat or

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.090
anything.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:41.299
Like the gentleman who came here, just to
beat Me now, I was just looking at the drum,

00:33:41.299 --> 00:33:44.239
and the fellow was getting frightened of Me,
he was going backwards, backwards, he would

00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:46.820
not come forward.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.489
But you don't develop any fear of at all about
anyone, because you are standing on truth,

00:33:51.489 --> 00:33:52.489
like Christ.

00:33:52.489 --> 00:34:00.610
At the time when He was challenged, you must
know when Mary Magdalene was beaten up, He

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:01.610
stood up.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:06.940
He had nothing to do with the prostitute,
such a virtuous man, He was virtue personified,

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.200
He stood up, He said, "Those who have not
committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me."

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.569
He was sure nobody can do it because He was
an authority of virtue.

00:34:15.569 --> 00:34:23.329
I, as I told you, I am just a woman and I
spoke openly with the names of these people

00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:28.619
and told of what they are going to do, and
how they are going to possess you.

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:31.720
And people came, they were frightened, they
said, "What are You doing?"

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:39.351
So you get rid of all your fear, but you do
not dominate anyone, you love, in your love

00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:40.770
you are secured.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:49.950
It is not by domination but the security that
you are love, you are compassion.

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:59.040
And the power of love is the highest of all,
that you stand in complete peace and bliss.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.180
This happens to you when the central thing
comes up.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:07.000
There are many other things happen, you can
become a poet, I mean so many things happen

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.210
with this, because you become such a compassion,
such a compassion.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:18.339
And when this compassion starts working you
are given all the help that is needed.

00:35:18.339 --> 00:35:24.490
Then the another chakra - I am going a little
fast because after all you understand that

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:30.720
there isn't much time today, I've been speaking,
and speaking every day, it's a marathon race

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:38.440
for Me, so I'll try to make it short now - it's
the Vishuddhi Chakra as he told you is very

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.660
important, this is America.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:47.160
Vishuddhi Chakra is America in the Universe.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.700
America is the Vishuddhi Chakra and the star
is the Saturn.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:36:01.200
There are seventeen of them, sixteen is the
planet moving round, there are sixteen centers

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.539
there and the seventeenth is the Vishuddhi
itself.

00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:13.400
Is a very important thing that this center
is America, so America has the responsibility

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.039
of transformation.

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:22.210
They have to take up the responsibility of
transforming the whole world.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:29.869
Instead of that they themselves are getting
ruined, they are killing themselves.

00:36:29.869 --> 00:36:37.359
There is no fear from outside I tell you,
we are going to be ruined from inside.

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:43.130
What a responsibility you have and what we
are doing you should see to that.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:50.220
That's why so many seekers are born here,
but they do not feel the responsibility of

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.349
transformation.

00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:59.020
They will, one day it will come, they will
have to feel it, once they are awakened I'm

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.200
sure they will feel that responsibility.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:12.220
This very important center as he must have
told you, by the virtue of this on the gross

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:20.760
we develop a face which is very relaxed and
attractive and good looking.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:30.980
We develop eyes which are full of compassion;
we develop a face which is innocent, which

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:39.160
is very smooth and which has got a capacity
to express its feeling.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.830
The smallest of feelings can be expressed
through this center.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.230
It looks after your nose, yours ears, everything
improves with this.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:54.930
You develop - now I can't hear anything if
a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.960
It is a very funny thing, unless and until
that person is very close I just can't hear

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.980
what he is saying, to Me, it is all what you
call "blah, blah, blah."

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.319
But a Sahaja Yogi, if he speaks to Me I can
hear very well.

00:38:09.319 --> 00:38:18.260
The whole thing changes, the whole sensitivity
changes, you start understanding what music

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:28.511
is good for your Spirit; you start understanding
what is good for your eyes to see, because

00:38:28.511 --> 00:38:33.230
you don't want like to see that is something
that is horrid, you just don't enjoy it.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.650
You feel like vomiting - you see something
horrid, you just feel like vomiting.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:42.150
You become so sensitive you can't imagine,
to virtue and to goodness.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:46.619
Automatically it happens to you, I don't have
to tell you.

00:38:46.619 --> 00:38:49.770
I've seen people have changed overnight.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:55.920
The whole idea is that the light has to be
brought in for you to see for yourself, and

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.359
when it happens you'll be amazed, you become
such a different, wonderful person.

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:08.630
There's everyone in America has Abraham Lincoln
within them, which has to be just awakened

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:15.710
and you'll find that that great personality
can be shown in you, when it happens to you.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:24.109
It has to happen to all of you to feel that
greatness that lies hidden within.

00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:30.270
I cannot elaborately tell you about Vishuddhi
Chakra what they call the Krishna consciousness,

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:36.480
but not this Krishna consciousness which has
made people actual beggars, they are begging

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.520
on the streets.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.760
You go in India in the villages, about they
were going to beat these people.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.799
They thought they are Krishna consciousness,
they wouldn't get places in the hotels because

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:49.250
they thought they are Krishna consciousness,
because these people were lost, they had no

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:50.680
money left with them.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.119
Now they are begging in India, imagine.

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:55.950
How can we afford to have these beggars there?

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:59.970
They have no money with them, they can not
come back, they don't know what to do with

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:05.490
them, so many you will find in the villages
just begging.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:15.619
So this kind of thing that - imagine a person
who is being blessed by Shri Krishna Who is

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:19.370
the Deity on this center, should beg!

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:24.690
He's the One Who is the giver of complete
wealth, why should we beg?

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:30.720
This is the thing they don't understand, just
the opposite of what they are suppose to be.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.390
There are lots of stories of Krishna how He
blessed people with wealth.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:41.609
It is to be seen sometimes, if you have time,
I may have time then we might be able to see

00:40:41.609 --> 00:40:45.440
all those beautiful things that He did.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:50.660
So the other chakra is important, is the Chakra
of Christ.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:56.980
This center is very important because this
is the gate through this you have to pass

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.450
to your destination which is the limbic area.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:04.359
So Christ is the gate, many people are shouting,
"it's only He can save."

00:41:04.359 --> 00:41:05.660
Where is He now?

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.029
Is He here?

00:41:07.029 --> 00:41:09.079
When He was living, they talked of Ibrahim,
when He came then they said, "You are not

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:11.150
the One.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.599
It was Moses.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:15.950
You are not the One."

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.740
They denied Him, defied Him.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.180
Now when He's dead, then we think, "It is
Christ."

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.900
Now I have come, He's talked about Me, if
you read Bible you'll find He's talked about

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.200
Me very clearly there and I have to do My
job and I have come.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.119
You are going to say that it was Christ Who
has to do it.

00:41:35.119 --> 00:41:40.720
If Christ could do it, why did He say that
"I'm going to send you a comforter"? He talked

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.869
of future, didn't He?

00:41:41.869 --> 00:41:43.100
Why did He say such a thing?

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.549
We should find out why did He say that "I
will send you the Holy Ghost and the Comforter

00:41:47.549 --> 00:41:49.809
and the Redeemer and a Counselor"?

00:41:49.809 --> 00:41:51.349
Why did He say that?

00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:52.569
Why not look forward to that?

00:41:52.569 --> 00:41:55.109
Because we are today after Christ.

00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:59.599
People don't want to see this point, they
want to depend on Christ because He's in their

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:02.339
pocket, they can use Him the way they like.

00:42:02.339 --> 00:42:08.610
When He has talked, He has said, "Why not
see the point?"

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:16.190
If this is what Christ is, then it is such
a bad thing because people say, "Christ was

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.450
no good."

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:20.470
They say, "What has Christ given us?"

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.200
Christians nations, what have they done, what
have they achieved?

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:28.280
It's a bad name to Him if you do not see completion
of His work.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:36.829
I'm here to complete His work and when you
do not complete His work, His half-work done

00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:39.710
in a very half-way will bring bad name to
Him.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:44.799
Why not people who claim about Christ understand
that what others have to say about it?

00:42:44.799 --> 00:42:48.730
If you want to know about Christians, go and
ask the Jews; and if you want to know about

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:53.320
the Jews, go and ask the Muslims; and if you
want to know about the Muslims, go and ask

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.320
the Hindus.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.730
There are all in a doldrum.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:05.440
Nobody has any understanding that they are
worshiping or they are admiring or advocating

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.079
a flower which belongs to one tree of life.

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:13.920
They have all plucked those flowers, "This
is mine, this is mine, in my pocket," and

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.109
fighting.

00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:20.520
If religion means fighting and quarreling,
it is not a religion at all.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.960
If it is integration, then it is a religion.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.380
In Sahaja Yoga you'll find that they are all
together.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:35.070
Christ has said, very clearly, "Those who
are not against Me are with Me."

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.270
Who are those people?

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.510
Try to find out.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.470
For that you have to little bit go out of
Bible.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.660
In the Bible how much do you have Christ there,
for three years?

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:52.260
Nobody allowed Him to live for three years,
and if they could, they would also kill Me.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:58.359
Not easy, He wanted to play the drama, otherwise
He would have finished all of them, in no

00:43:58.359 --> 00:43:59.359
time.

00:43:59.359 --> 00:44:06.510
So He has said that "You are to be resurrected
first, and then that's how you will be judged."

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:13.119
And the Day of Judgment is today, this is
the Day of Judgment, that's why you are confused,

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:17.519
this is the Day of Judgment where you will
be judged and how are you going to be judged?

00:44:17.519 --> 00:44:19.410
Through your Kundalini.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:25.319
Your Kundalini is going to be awakened and
you'll be judged where you are.

00:44:25.319 --> 00:44:31.240
That's what it is, and those who will be calling
Me, "Christ, Christ" I will not look at them,

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.580
that's what it is.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:38.660
By calling Him "Christ, Christ" you do not
become Christians, you have to get your Realization,

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.400
your baptism in the actual sense.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.000
It has to be an actualization.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.500
I'm telling you that if you miss the point,
you have missed it for ever and ever.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.200
Be careful on that point.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.880
It's very important.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.760
Don't run after things which have no meaning
to your consciousness.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:04.349
Try to raise yourself up to this point and
understand that the time has come for you

00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:10.780
to transform, this is the time of your judgment
and you have to get to it in a very big way.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.730
The shallow things and all this will be finished.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:18.800
What is America or what is any country in
the eyes of God?

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800
Nothing.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:26.450
If they do not take to His ways, all will
be treated like waste, thoroughly waste, it's

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.460
a wasteland.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:34.450
But if you rise, thousands and thousands and
millions and millions can be saved.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:41.220
Try to rise, try to understand your own responsibilities,
that is very important.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:48.970
Today is the last day and the last center
which is the Sahasrara, is the integration,

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:55.730
integration of your being, of physical, mental,
emotional being, it takes place.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.940
Is integration of all the Deities, of all
the Prophets, all the great works that they

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:08.000
have done, integration of all the scriptures,
everything takes places when this Sahasrara

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.500
is opened out, when you become the Spirit.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.589
This is a much more difficult job, I know,
because if you don't have to transform people

00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:19.550
it is very easy to talk about it and get away.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:26.710
But I have to transform, not only transform
but you have to become, you cannot become

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:33.819
a Sahaji Yogi by paying Me, by saying things,
by arguing, by showing up, you can only become

00:46:33.819 --> 00:46:38.109
Sahaji Yogi by going within yourself, face
up to it, see for yourself.

00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:44.020
I am here to help you in every way possible.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:50.039
Whatever is possible we'll try to do it, but
you all should also understand your responsibility.

00:46:50.039 --> 00:46:53.710
It is not a joke now, it's no more a joke.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:59.480
It's not like Sunday morning you get up and
go to church, or Monday morning you go somewhere

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.579
else in the temple, and Tuesday morning you
go to see Siddhivinayaka [Temple of Shri Ganesha

00:47:03.579 --> 00:47:09.329
- SG] and another day you go to a mosque.

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:10.349
It is not like that.

00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:13.410
It is a very serious thing which we must understand.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:17.410
We are at the brink of destruction, be careful
about it.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:22.519
We must do things so that the blessings of
God comes to upon us and that we are saved.

00:47:22.519 --> 00:47:30.720
It is a very serious thing, and the responsibility
is much more on all the people who are getting

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.700
Realization, so do not treat it lightly.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.369
You all, I hope, will take it seriously.

00:47:35.369 --> 00:47:43.839
Thank God there is a nice seminar we are having
after this for three days, you can come down

00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:48.860
there, they have charged you very little,
we don't have to make any profit of out you,

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:53.109
the only profit I can make is that you get
your profits, that's all.

00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:58.569
So please take it up seriously, work it out
seriously, and I tell you, out of you will

00:47:58.569 --> 00:48:03.299
come out those people who will build that
foundations of that construction which is

00:48:03.299 --> 00:48:04.299
going to come.

00:48:04.299 --> 00:48:09.609
Please don't waste your time in useless things,
get to it.

00:48:09.609 --> 00:48:12.490
Any one of you can do it.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:17.069
I bless you with My whole heart and know that
I love you very much.

00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:22.069
If you have any problems, you can write to
Me, but don't write to Me about your family

00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:25.990
problems and this and that, it's a headache
to Me, there is no need to write.

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:30.200
Of course I'm a mother, if you have problems
you can write but some people write ten pages

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.779
saying, "my wife is fighting me."

00:48:31.779 --> 00:48:33.339
It's bit too much.

00:48:33.339 --> 00:48:39.259
You should write to Me about the problems
which concern the whole country, concern the

00:48:39.259 --> 00:48:40.569
whole world.

00:48:40.569 --> 00:48:46.490
Widen yourself and that's how, though you
may think that you are very unassuming simple

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:50.549
people, you are the ones who are going to
be, not those who are successful, they are

00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:54.440
blinded by their success; not those who are
rich, they are not going to enter into the

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:57.680
Kingdom of God; not those who have a big name,
no.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:23.940
It's you, you are going to enter into the
Kingdom 

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:34.079
of God.

00:49:34.079 --> 00:50:14.400
May God bless you.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:34.560
[Self Realization]

00:50:34.560 --> 00:51:23.319
Now, all 
the angels have 

00:51:23.319 --> 00:52:16.430
a seat, now, put your hands towards Me like
this, and close your eyes, the vibrations

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.369
are so much today, nothing to do.

00:52:18.369 --> 00:52:21.869
Just so much vibrations tonight, it's tremendous.

00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:41.880
Just close your eyes, you'll feel the cool
breeze, most of you, close your eyes please.

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:47.900
You just put your right hand on the head and
see if there is a cool breeze coming out,

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:56.119
little higher, on top of your head.

00:52:56.119 --> 00:52:58.329
Hmm, it's there.

00:52:58.329 --> 00:53:06.900
Now put your right hand towards Me and put
the left hand and see, little higher, about

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:37.120
six inches higher, six inches higher, change
over, again, now put your hands up like this

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:55.970
absolutely, close the eyes and ask, "Is this
the breeze of the Holy Ghost" or ask the question

00:53:55.970 --> 00:54:05.630
"Mother, are You the Holy Ghost?

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:07.750
You feel the cool breeze?

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:13.990
Good, it's tremendous today.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:17.210
May God bless you all.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:24.130
Those who have not felt any cool breeze, please
raise your hands.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:27.859
One, two and three.

00:54:27.859 --> 00:54:33.490
Are keeping all right?

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:37.059
You are not well?

00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:44.290
All right, doesn't matter, if you are not
well maybe you may not feel today but you'll

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:47.410
get well and then you'll feel it, so it doesn't
matter.

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:52.650
There's one or two persons who have not felt
it, it's so tremendous today, May God bless

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:53.650
you.

00:54:53.650 --> 00:55:02.650
You may give your addresses to these people,
let them know where you are, also you can

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:08.180
take address for the seminar, if you want
to come, they are going to arrange a transport

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.829
for you to go to Santa Cruz.

00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:14.650
Thank you very much.

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:22.740
I say goodbye to you, after a year I'll definitely
will come to Los Angeles again, those who

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.829
haven't cool breeze should keep their hands
raised.

00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:27.089
These boys will come and see you.

00:55:27.089 --> 00:55:30.670
All right, those people who haven't got it,
please keep your hands slightly raised so

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.579
some people will come and see you, little
higher so that they'll come and see you.

00:55:34.579 --> 00:55:35.579
Here just have a look.

00:55:35.579 --> 00:55:44.490
Man in the Audience: I didn't hear Your last
question.

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:46.896
I didn't understand what You asked about the
Holy Ghost.

00:55:46.896 --> 00:55:52.680
Shri Mataji: Just to know that I am the Holy
Ghost.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.349
Man in the Audience: You are Holy Ghost?

00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:55.349
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:56.349
Otherwise how will you recognize?

00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:57.349
Man in the Audience: The Bible says that God
is the Holy Ghost.

00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:58.349
Shri Mataji: Bible never says that.

00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:59.559
You don't understand that.

00:55:59.559 --> 00:56:01.259
You don't teach Me Bible.

00:56:01.259 --> 00:56:06.930
[Man keeps interrupting Shri Mataji] It doesn't
say.

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.759
You don't tell Me.

00:56:09.759 --> 00:56:12.599
You have no knowledge.

00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:14.720
Don't disturb others.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:20.390
If you are such a good person you ...
