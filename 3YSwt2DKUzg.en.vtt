00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:21.180
Today is the day we are celebrating Easter.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:36.180
Easter is extremely symbolic, of - not only
of Christ, but also for all of us.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:49.659
In that the most important day is that of
resurrection.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:01:06.370
The resurrection of Christ has 
the message of Christianity, not the cross.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:21.210
Through resurrection Christ had shown that
one can be resurrected with the body that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.010
you have.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:37.240
And without His resurrection, we could not
have managed the crossing of Agnya chakra,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.550
no doubt.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:54.500
His life was very short of, we can say three
and half years only, He lived there.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:04.729
He came to India and He met Shalivahana, and
Shalivahana asked His name.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.799
He told him His name was Isa Masih.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:16.010
But He said, "I am coming from the country
where there are malichchas, mala-ichchha.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:26.630
They have ichchha of mal, desire to get dirty,
and I don't know how to live there.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.819
To Me, this is My country."

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:40.150
But Shalivahana said that, "You should go
back and save Your people and give them Parama

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.280
Nirmala Tattwam.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.980
So He went back, and as it is, within three
and half years He was crucified.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:02.960
At the time of His death He said so many beautiful
things for forgiveness, but ultimately He

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.310
said "Behold the Mother."

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.960
That means you should hope for the Mother.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:23.030
And in His lifetime He also said that, "I'll
send you the Holy Ghost Who will comfort you,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.879
counsel you and also redeem", means resurrect
you.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:38.610
All these things He had said it because He
knew what was the whole plan.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:48.180
Also He said that, "You may say anything against
Me or do anything against Me, but anything

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.519
against the Holy Ghost I will not tolerate.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.370
I will not tolerate at any cost."

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:09.360
Which is true also, so it is very dangerous
also to go against the Holy Ghost.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.810
No doubt about it.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.670
It's not Me that is dangerous, but these Deities
are extremely dangerous.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:29.940
So, in Sahaja Yoga you are all resurrected
with your body.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.960
Before this you were not connected to the
All Pervading Power, and whatever you did

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.080
was through your mind or through your emotions.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:05:02.450
But you did not come out of that grave of
emotions and your desires, your actions and

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.530
your ego.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.930
After realization now you know how free you
have become.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:26.530
How you have developed your own personality.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:38.449
There are so many instances which we can talk
about Christ, that He said, "Know Thyself"

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.520
throughout.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.960
He knew without knowing yourself, you won't
be resurrected.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.290
But Sahaja Yoga is the other way round.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.880
You get your resurrection and you know yourself.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:02.740
It's a very Sahaja, sweet way of getting realization.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:12.580
But if you see to the life of Christ, He has
talked about murmuring souls.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.080
We too have in Sahaja Yoga, because it's open
to everyone, all kinds of people come.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:28.830
We find very shallow people coming to Sahaja
Yoga who try to express their shallowness

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:41.310
and talk in a very, in a very 
loose way, about Sahaja Yoga, about the work

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.210
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:52.479
So that was inevitable, but what Christ has
said that you have to be careful about the

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.440
murmuring souls.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.330
And this is exactly - we have to be very careful.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:06.419
When you come to Sahaja Yoga, in the beginning,
you may come across such people who are murmuring

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:20.110
souls, you may be enticed by them because
they are a kind of, we should say, messengers

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.800
of negative forces.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.430
And these messengers of negative forces, you
should try to find out.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.890
They'll complain about this, complain about
that, they talk in a very loose manner, and

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:48.210
when you see that they are not talking in
a positive way, you should run away from them.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:54.669
Because only by getting your resurrection
you are not all right.

00:07:54.669 --> 00:08:00.680
After getting your resurrection, after your
Self-realization, you have to grow.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:10.599
And for that growth we have to be very careful
about how we get impressed by all these, I

00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:14.509
should say, very frivolous people.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:21.169
Those who grow into it become beautiful angels.

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:24.160
No doubt about that.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.759
But that is one thing one has to know is to
respect your Self-realization.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:34.699
You shouldn't worry about what others are
talking, what others are saying, what they

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:42.520
are criticizing, but you should look at yourself
and all the time try to grow into your depth.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.369
It's a very great chance of life that you
are being resurrected, and this is the last

00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:51.889
breakthrough, as you know, of our evolution.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:58.329
But now you should leave your mind on one
side; because this mind, if you go on working

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:05.829
with it, you cannot go beyond mind and Sahaja
Yoga you can achieve by going beyond your

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:08.100
mind.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.350
Then you know yourself, because you get Self-knowledge.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.029
You know about your centers.

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:18.110
You know about the centers of others.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:26.800
All this is available to you, but you have
to become a subtler and subtler person.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.269
Not a gross personality.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:37.420
If you become subtler and subtler, you will
be amazed how you will develop your inner

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.869
powers in so many different ways.

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:48.850
But there are people in Sahaja Yoga, I have
seen, who are very ambitious.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:54.699
And they start saying that, "Mother, we want
to be God realized.

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:57.399
I want to be this and do that."

00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:03.220
There is no office going on here that you
give somebody a promotion.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.470
You have to grow yourself.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:11.360
Then they start proclaiming, "I am this, I
am that."

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.540
We call them 'Mahayogis'.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.889
Some of them had started saying that they
have reached very high positions and they

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:23.399
ended up in the lunatic asylum.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:32.040
All such suggestions if people give you, then
you should shun such people.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:39.220
But there are also other people who join such
a bombastic fellow.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:50.009
So, you must remember that this last judgment
is working and all the time there is a big

00:10:50.009 --> 00:10:59.869
sieving out, a very big arrangement of choices.

00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:05.369
Those who are subtle, start getting subtler
and subtler and subtler.

00:11:05.369 --> 00:11:15.579
But those who are frivolous, gross, idiotic,
stupid, they start frittering away.

00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:25.290
So this last sieving starts very fast, working
out where we realize that where are we.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:30.910
Now what is the criteria for that?

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:37.549
First is your compassion.

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:44.639
Your compassion must be discrete.

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:49.199
Sometimes people only have compassion for
negative people.

00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:58.199
After Sahaja Yoga you should know for whom
you should have your compassion.

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:05.819
With vibrations you can find out, very easy
to find out with vibrations - what sort of

00:12:05.819 --> 00:12:07.920
a person you are facing.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.329
But first you must have vibratory awareness.

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:24.350
If you don't have vibratory awareness, you
won't be able to find out at all what is correct

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.290
and what is incorrect.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:32.989
So it is important that you all must mediate.

00:12:32.989 --> 00:12:37.790
Without criticizing yourself, anything, you
can just meditate everyday.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.160
Is very important!

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:47.709
I immediately know who is the person who is
meditating and who is not meditating.

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:48.709
Immediately!

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:58.100
The person who meditates is very clearly an
angel.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:09.939
The whole reaction, the whole behavior, the
whole attitude of such spiritual maturity

00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:11.739
manifests.

00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:16.160
And you are amazed.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.049
As you know Sahasrare Mahamaya.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:23.220
It's not easy to understand Me.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:31.430
For the time being you might know what I am,
but suddenly you will forget.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.059
That's the trick.

00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:38.720
Because if you know Me in full ways, you won't
even sit here.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.660
You won't even come nearer to Me.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:51.610
So that Mahamaya is acting all the time, but
that's the only way you can judge people.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.560
This last judgment is not a easy thing.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.180
Even if you put thousands of judges, they
cannot do this judgment.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:07.869
All the time you have to know what is what.

00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:14.999
And somehow I know everything, but I will
never show that I know.

00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:24.169
That's how I work it out, and gradually I
know what I have to do about that person.

00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:33.029
This resurrection of yours is much more blessed
than that of Christ.

00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:37.730
He was alone; people wouldn't recognize Him.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:45.109
He had to show His marks where they had put
nails on His hands and feet.

00:14:45.109 --> 00:14:48.649
But today that is not the situation.

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:55.230
Only thing is, first of all you have to recognize
Me.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.549
That's all.

00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:58.499
Need not know Me.

00:14:58.499 --> 00:14:59.499
It's not easy.

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:05.389
It's difficult to know Me, but if you recognize
Me, that's all.

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:09.310
And it all depends on your sensitivity.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:18.839
Your resurrection has to be complete and you
have to mature in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:23.839
If you cannot mature, I will say you should
leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:32.579
Go out for a while, where you will understand
what's going on, then you'll come back.

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:44.829
In Sahaja Yoga, like Christ sacrificed His
life, is not expected of you to sacrifice

00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:45.829
your life.

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:48.720
Your Mother doesn't want that.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:59.319
But you have to do some sacrifices, like you
have to stay in uncomfortable places in Ganapatipule

00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:01.339
sometimes, or somewhere.

00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:12.669
You have to face many odds while traveling,
also coming down here may not be so comfortable

00:16:12.669 --> 00:16:16.389
as you are at your place.

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:21.609
But the main sacrifice is of your ego.

00:16:21.609 --> 00:16:23.679
You have to crucify your ego.

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:34.110
The ego is the one, which teaches you all
these nonsensical tantrums that people know.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:45.819
If you can surrender your ego - just surrender
your ego - that surrendering can help you.

00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:55.959
But if you surrender your ego by thinking
about it, then you are using your mental capacity.

00:16:55.959 --> 00:17:02.489
Everything you do like that is through your
mental capacity, by which you are using your

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:04.770
ego.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:13.179
So the best way is to meditate, to go into
thoughtless awareness and there automatically

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:14.870
you are surrendered.

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.769
Now what do I have to have from you?

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:18.769
Nothing!

00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:19.769
I don't want anything.

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:21.909
I don't want to have anything.

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:24.630
You are the ones who try to give Me this and
give Me that.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.110
I am trying to run away from all that.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:33.720
Just for your satisfaction also, I agree.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:41.669
I don't have to do Sahaja Yoga Myself, but
that's the love of your Mother.

00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:50.929
That She wants to save as many as possible
- all that are created on this Earth - to

00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:51.929
give them their resurrection.

00:17:51.929 --> 00:17:56.840
This is a special time and you are My channels.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:06.169
You can go all over and spread Sahaja Yoga
and try to help others to come out of it.

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:14.669
Today is a day of promises, where we have
to promise ourselves that we'll grow in a

00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:26.649
very deeper understanding, or feeling, or
in sensitiveness of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:26.649 --> 00:18:34.100
This growth has to take place for which I
have to meditate.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.700
This is a very important thing.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:44.160
Secondly, people say that here people are
very miserly.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.380
They are not willing to do this.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.019
They don't want to pay any money for this,
pay any money for that.

00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:55.270
I think generosity is one expression of your
love.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.490
You will give Me, all right.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:04.440
When it comes to expenses, either I pay or
somebody bears the burden.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:12.130
Now things have improved, but still we should
know that this tremendous work has to be done

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.880
and we need money for that.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.539
I don't need, I spend My own money.

00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:29.490
But generosity is the best and this generosity
is very, very important for Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:35.100
I have seen people are very meticulous sometimes,
very calculating.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.320
They will tell Me, "Bring some sarees for
them."

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.309
Take some sarees, all right, very good idea.

00:19:41.309 --> 00:19:44.210
And they say, "We don't like it, we don't
want to buy."

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.700
I am not doing any business.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.600
I buy it because you wanted, I have selected
it.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.730
Then to say, "we don't want to have it."

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:58.240
There's no business, there's no marketing
going on.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:05.260
And this is the problem when I don't understand
Sahaja Yogis that they should know Mother,

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.090
Herself, has put in Her money.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:14.960
So what is there also, they should say, "take
little more for Sahaja Yoga."

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.860
After all such a big organization going on,
and there are so many countries who cannot

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.740
pay a single farthing, for them also one has
to pay.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.179
Now, Christ was sold for thirty rubles.

00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:35.029
You can imagine, He was sold for thirty rubles.

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:44.090
So that shows that when you do not try to
understand the financial difficulties of the

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:52.630
organizers and you do not help, you are really
selling the Christ within you.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:21:00.690
You cannot sell Christ, you cannot sell Sahaja
Yoga.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.210
But that doesn't mean you exploit it.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:10.250
So I have to tell you that I was Myself surprised
in north India where I least expected people

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:15.090
are extremely generous, extremely generous.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:27.029
And then generosity helps you, in a way that
our Lakshmi Tatwa is to be awakened.

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:33.620
I had to bring in this point because I have
complaints from people that people are reluctant

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.190
to pay for anything like this.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:48.269
It's very remarkable that some people take
over, but everybody must contribute.

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:52.440
It's important, because you are doing God's
work.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.779
You have to also come forward to do other
things that are there without grudging.

00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:59.299
Enjoying it!

00:21:59.299 --> 00:22:06.769
I was happy the posters were put by the Sahaja
Yogis, and you can see the whole place vibrated.

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:11.460
You could see how it has worked out.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:18.390
So everybody must go all out to do everything
that is possible.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:25.919
Nothing else is needed but your full heart
into Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.409
Then you will see how you will grow.

00:22:28.409 --> 00:22:34.379
It is only through your heart you will receive
all your nourishment for your spirituality.

00:22:34.379 --> 00:25:43.480
So open 

00:25:43.480 --> 00:26:20.570
your heart, do 

00:26:20.570 --> 00:37:22.319
not calculate so much.
