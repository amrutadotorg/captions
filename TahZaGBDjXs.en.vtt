00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:26.171
﻿I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:37.211
Yesterday as I told you,

00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.931
this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:48.971
We have the knowledge of the tree.

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:57.811
But if the tree grows and grows

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:02.411
and does not pay attention to its roots,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.948
then there is always

00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:15.411
a definite stage where the tree gets destroyed.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:29.538
So the destruction is not going to come to us

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.773
from outside.

00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:35.651
It is going to work out from within ourselves.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.220
Through various diseases,

00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:50.053
through various mishaps in our lives.

00:03:56.094 --> 00:04:00.017
It is important to see

00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:03.016
that you become the Spirit

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:06.545
so that you will understand the mysteries of life.

00:04:15.524 --> 00:04:18.072
Even in the medical science

00:04:18.273 --> 00:04:21.851
there are many things which cannot be explained by them.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.371
Or in any science

00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:33.171
whatever theories are propounded are all the time challenged.

00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.382
They are not absolute.

00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:45.171
So there is something lacking in human awareness

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:48.512
that we are not at an absolute point.

00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:58.091
Now this beautiful arrangement is made within ourselves

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.171
during our evolutionary process.

00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:11.219
But when we go to the left or to the right,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.867
to the extremes, then what happens,

00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:18.371
is that our centers which are like this,

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.573
get broken,

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:31.458
and we lose the connection with the whole.

00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:37.171
As a result of that we develop

00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:41.002
diseases which are psychosomatic, may be physical,

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:43.202
may be emotional.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.669
But the Kundalini,

00:05:51.073 --> 00:05:54.691
which is the vital force passes through the center

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:58.811
and brings the broken centers together,

00:06:05.454 --> 00:06:08.571
and brings the attention in the center.

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:15.511
When our attention is on the left or on the right,

00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:20.571
we go into different various funny experiences.

00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:30.960
Like when we go to the right side,

00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:34.811
we feel as if our body is

00:06:35.486 --> 00:06:38.487
somewhere and we are flying in the air.

00:06:46.616 --> 00:06:49.700
This we call as supraconscious experiences.

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:55.451
People start seeing the future,

00:06:55.944 --> 00:06:57.944
living in the future.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:04.331
But they do not know how it happens.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.885
They have no control over it.

00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:12.291
They have no scientific knowledge of it.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.971
As if we are carried away by some force.

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.971
On the left hand side if you move too much,

00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:27.560
then you develop,

00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.571
of course, horrible diseases which are psychosomatic.

00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:42.789
But also you become possessed by funny ideas

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.132
and you start jumping and gesticulating and

00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:50.363
singing in a very miserable way.

00:07:57.798 --> 00:08:02.888
So within us all these problems lie on the extremes of our being.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.168
I’ll tell you how cancer is caused.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.571
Supposing the person is in the center

00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:21.531
there is no possibility of

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.251
his getting into cancer.

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:35.070
Supposing he goes too much to the right; he is over active, planning,

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.270
futuristic man.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.611
Then his chakras move outward like this.

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:55.091
Then he becomes vulnerable to cancer.

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:01.611
Because his connection to the mains is lost.

00:09:05.429 --> 00:09:09.211
But now, supposing somehow or other

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:14.291
he goes to the left, he gets a shock or meets with an accident

00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.971
or he meets a bad ‘guru’, he goes to the left,

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:26.925
or he gets mesmerized.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:31.931
Then he is triggered into cancer.

00:09:37.307 --> 00:09:39.307
Now the doctors do say

00:09:39.508 --> 00:09:43.606
that cancer is caused by triggering of…

00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:47.628
they call it protein 52,

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:51.251
protein 54, protein 58.

00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:01.838
52, 54, 58.

00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:08.611
These are just the names given by them.

00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:15.060
But they say that it is coming to us through the area

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.571
which is built within us since our creation.

00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:31.531
That means there is an area which we call in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:34.282
as collective subconscious,

00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:44.291
where everything that is dead in the atmosphere

00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:46.849
is stored.

00:10:49.997 --> 00:10:51.997
From our creation.

00:10:53.918 --> 00:10:56.731
And when anything from there

00:10:57.327 --> 00:10:59.571
comes into our attention,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.371
we start developing cancer;

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.952
because you have lost connection with the whole.

00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:21.290
You become, the cells become on their own.

00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:28.556
They start acting on their own.

00:11:30.818 --> 00:11:33.451
That becomes, they become malignant.

00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:40.291
Now supposing you can bring by any chance,

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.640
this centre, again these two,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.358
two broken chakras into one centre,

00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:54.418
then cancer can be cured.

00:11:57.122 --> 00:12:02.197
Sahaja Yoga has cured many types of cancer inclusive of blood cancer.

00:12:07.616 --> 00:12:10.171
But it is your own power.

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:17.711
It is nobody else’s power, it is your own power within you works it out.

00:12:22.673 --> 00:12:27.731
And it has been now proved even by doctors,

00:12:27.931 --> 00:12:32.091
as I told you yesterday that two doctors got their Phd,

00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:35.319
in Sahaja Yoga, from Delhi University.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.690
There is another thing we can discuss here about

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:51.530
the diseases which are caused due to over activity of the mind.

00:12:58.048 --> 00:13:01.525
Here you can see in the centre is a round portion

00:13:01.726 --> 00:13:04.143
which we call as the ‘Void’.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.448
There resides the ten valences of human beings.

00:13:16.608 --> 00:13:20.211
And if these ten valances are enlightened

00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:23.497
you can never go into extremes.

00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.776
But when you are overactive and extremely

00:13:33.977 --> 00:13:36.571
futuristic then,

00:13:36.771 --> 00:13:40.610
there is a center there which is
called as ‘Swadishthana’, the second centre,

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.371
has to work very hard;

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:56.611
which actually looks after the aortic plexus in our stomach,

00:13:56.811 --> 00:13:59.576
in our viscera, in the stomach.

00:14:06.205 --> 00:14:10.331
Now this chakra has one very important work to do

00:14:10.531 --> 00:14:14.571
is to convert the fat of the stomach

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:19.011
for the use of the brain which is the grey cells.

00:14:32.025 --> 00:14:35.491
But if you think too much and too much and too much,

00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:38.530
you need this replacement all the time.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.811
And this replacement is done by this chakra.

00:14:52.152 --> 00:14:55.410
Now this chakra has also other things to be done,

00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:57.611
like liver,

00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:03.815
it has to look after the spleen,

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:07.246
the pancreas,

00:15:07.896 --> 00:15:09.930
and intestines.

00:15:11.028 --> 00:15:14.532
Also it has to look after the kidneys

00:15:14.733 --> 00:15:17.711
and the lower end of the large intestines.

00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:27.491
So when this gets busy with transforming

00:15:27.691 --> 00:15:32.400
the cells for the grey cells, fat cells into grey cells,

00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:35.666
it has no time for other functions.

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:48.759
As a result of that you get a very bad liver.

00:15:53.176 --> 00:15:58.891
Your attention becomes very distorted.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.943
And all the time you feel uneasy.

00:16:12.278 --> 00:16:15.491
You don’t feel like eating your food, and even if you eat,

00:16:15.691 --> 00:16:17.691
you feel like vomiting it.

00:16:22.373 --> 00:16:25.563
But it can go further and you might get the cirrhosis of the liver,

00:16:25.763 --> 00:16:28.330
skin troubles all kinds of things.

00:16:36.104 --> 00:16:39.131
Specially, with a bad liver if you go for sun bathing,

00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.531
you are sure to get skin cancer.

00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:52.851
Too much oil and too much fatty foods

00:16:53.051 --> 00:16:55.451
if you eat also you get very bad liver.

00:17:01.167 --> 00:17:05.531
And maybe that you become very thin with it,

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:14.091
because the liver cannot consume any fats in your body.

00:17:18.227 --> 00:17:22.211
Then there is also the pancreas,

00:17:22.617 --> 00:17:26.452
which is responsible for absorbing our sugar.

00:17:34.143 --> 00:17:36.601
That also goes out of order.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.884
As a result of that you develop diabetes.

00:17:45.743 --> 00:17:49.811
In an Indian village, a villager takes so much sugar

00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:54.349
that he says that the spoon must stand in the cup.

00:18:01.453 --> 00:18:04.116
But he never gets diabetes.

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:09.731
Because he does not sit down and think too much.

00:18:12.684 --> 00:18:15.808
He deals with the life as it comes to him.

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:23.062
And he is above too much of thinking.

00:18:26.222 --> 00:18:30.572
Then the third thing that happens to you is even more serious.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.331
The spleen that is responsible for attending to your emergencies

00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:42.211
produces more red blood corpuscles.

00:18:49.188 --> 00:18:51.771
Supposing you have taken some food

00:18:51.971 --> 00:18:54.521
and after that you start running immediately,

00:18:54.721 --> 00:18:57.365
you get a pain in that area.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.211
And that area becomes extremely sensitive.

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:16.731
But in modern times, we are all the time giving shocks to our spleen,

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.610
because our life is so hectic.

00:19:26.044 --> 00:19:30.051
Early in the morning we read the newspapers, horrible news, one shock.

00:19:35.084 --> 00:19:37.500
Then we are in a hurry, we have our lunch,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.771
somehow our breakfast somehow,

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:44.531
get into the car, and then we see the big crowd

00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:47.771
of cars and a jam.

00:19:54.462 --> 00:19:56.462
Comes the second shock.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:02.718
And like that, we go on shocking our system all the time.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:09.731
Whatever arrogance human beings may have,

00:20:13.195 --> 00:20:16.131
whatever may they think of themselves,

00:20:18.195 --> 00:20:21.919
they must know that they are made very delicately

00:20:24.635 --> 00:20:26.635
and very carefully.

00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:31.276
They should not treat them like hippopotamus.

00:20:33.334 --> 00:20:35.334
They are human beings.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:39.107
And if they start treating themselves like that,

00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:44.095
they end up with horrible diseases like blood cancer.

00:20:49.793 --> 00:20:53.316
Then with the kidney you develop high blood pressures,

00:20:57.321 --> 00:21:00.171
then kidney non-functioning,

00:21:03.363 --> 00:21:05.363
then remove the kidney.

00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:08.941
You get constipated.

00:21:10.657 --> 00:21:15.560
All these things come to you because of over activity of the mind.

00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.208
Actually there is no need to plan too much.

00:21:26.831 --> 00:21:30.331
Because if you go on planning like this, it never works out.

00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:38.043
You must keep it open to see how it works out.

00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:46.811
I had… I was staying somewhere else, at one place,

00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:50.171
and I had to go to some place very far away.

00:21:51.402 --> 00:21:53.771
Now if I had gone all the way back,

00:21:53.971 --> 00:21:57.503
as planned, I would have never reached you.

00:22:08.424 --> 00:22:11.057
So I decided to come directly

00:22:13.804 --> 00:22:15.804
and it has worked,

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.000
without disturbing my system.

00:22:21.802 --> 00:22:25.668
Now we have watches in our hands, and all the time looking at the watch

00:22:25.868 --> 00:22:28.617
and getting frightened of the time.

00:22:33.332 --> 00:22:35.332
We have to save time.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.910
But for what?

00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:43.451
Like somebody in India was very anxious to catch a plane

00:22:43.651 --> 00:22:46.711
and he wouldn’t get a ticket so he was very agitated.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.330
I said, “But what is so necessary?”

00:22:55.531 --> 00:22:58.448
He said, “I have to go and attend a ball”.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.680
Waste of time.

00:23:06.974 --> 00:23:11.931
For that he was so much jarring his own system.

00:23:16.774 --> 00:23:19.131
And when you hear such people,

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:22.423
suddenly they collapse and die with heart.

00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:30.062
Because if you become too much right sided,

00:23:30.263 --> 00:23:33.431
the Spirit stops,

00:23:33.631 --> 00:23:38.556
He dies, in a sense that it never dies but it sleeps off. It disappears.

00:23:44.475 --> 00:23:47.141
Your heart becomes like a stone.

00:23:49.422 --> 00:23:52.070
With your arrogance it is even worse.

00:23:54.431 --> 00:23:58.058
And then the reflection of God is not there.

00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:04.726
Such people have no compassion, no love

00:24:05.024 --> 00:24:07.031
and no joy.

00:24:09.975 --> 00:24:12.225
They are joy killers.

00:24:14.463 --> 00:24:17.868
All this running about is for joy.

00:24:21.754 --> 00:24:24.369
But it’s a joyless pursuit.

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:29.472
Then comes the left sided people,

00:24:32.213 --> 00:24:35.719
who indulges into nonsensical romances

00:24:38.788 --> 00:24:44.011
and indulge into all kinds of sufferings for nothing at all.

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:51.891
Like in Paris, when I first went,
they said, “Mother, you look such a happy person.

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:54.244
They are not going to like You.”

00:25:01.587 --> 00:25:05.079
They think that joyous people are ignorant.

00:25:07.898 --> 00:25:10.636
They don’t know what is happening in this world.

00:25:12.506 --> 00:25:16.331
So I started My lecture with “Les Miserable”.

00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:22.673
“Les Miserable”.

00:25:23.251 --> 00:25:25.451
If you have a pub

00:25:25.931 --> 00:25:29.291
at every fifth lamp post,

00:25:29.491 --> 00:25:34.121
and a bad women standing at every third lamp post in Paris,

00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:36.595
you are inviting trouble.

00:25:46.505 --> 00:25:50.931
You see a person coming out of a pub and falling off on the street,

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.100
and you enter into the same pub.

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:04.211
You see people getting into the trouble with

00:26:04.411 --> 00:26:06.731
funny sex habits,

00:26:08.829 --> 00:26:12.011
but still you want to do that, yourself.

00:26:20.068 --> 00:26:22.710
You are not a free person at all

00:26:24.306 --> 00:26:26.491
and neither you are powerful.

00:26:28.223 --> 00:26:32.771
You get tempted all the time to the forces of your destruction.

00:26:36.431 --> 00:26:39.571
So that you have no discretion either,

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.971
nor understanding of your glory,

00:26:46.918 --> 00:26:48.930
nor of your beauty,

00:26:49.131 --> 00:26:53.654
that God had created you especially to enter into His kingdom.

00:26:58.968 --> 00:27:02.392
So we live in our own paradise of destruction,

00:27:05.775 --> 00:27:09.082
go on destroying ourselves gradually.

00:27:11.812 --> 00:27:14.089
Nothing gives us happiness.

00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:17.531
We run from

00:27:18.604 --> 00:27:22.968
place to place to find happiness and joy.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.691
Ultimately, I think, people have to put electrodes in their limbic area,

00:27:30.891 --> 00:27:33.600
to feel joy like the monkeys do.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.811
We don’t respect ourselves and we don’t try to understand ourselves.

00:27:48.788 --> 00:27:50.788
Why are we created?

00:27:53.216 --> 00:27:55.377
What is the purpose of our life?

00:27:57.282 --> 00:27:59.731
What do we have to get out of life?

00:28:02.296 --> 00:28:06.731
Such a ocean of joy is lying ahead

00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:13.481
and we do not want to go to it.

00:28:15.767 --> 00:28:18.803
This kind of things are happening

00:28:19.177 --> 00:28:24.091
and that is why yesterday I told that Spanish people should now rise

00:28:24.291 --> 00:28:28.503
and see and get the joy out of their lives.

00:28:36.027 --> 00:28:40.123
A little journey of three to four feet of the Kundalini

00:28:40.323 --> 00:28:43.255
brings forth this joy to you.

00:28:52.106 --> 00:28:56.771
So I have to make a request to you.

00:28:56.971 --> 00:28:58.991
As there is less time today,

00:28:59.192 --> 00:29:03.451
I won’t be asking for questions today.

00:29:03.651 --> 00:29:07.971
Yesterday we spent about one and a half an hour on useless questions.

00:29:17.516 --> 00:29:19.891
So better get your Realization.

00:29:22.372 --> 00:29:25.125
You don’t have to know all these things.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.996
As you don’t have to know about the electricity,

00:29:30.196 --> 00:29:33.811
you have to just put on the switch because it is all built in.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.910
May God bless you all!

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.026
I come here every year and I am sure I will come next year also.

00:30:05.098 --> 00:30:09.887
It is little bit cooperation you have to give Me.

00:30:14.308 --> 00:30:17.931
As you have seen I have taken out the shoes

00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:21.074
because the Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:31.375
She sucks our problems much faster than we know of.

00:30:36.531 --> 00:30:41.578
So, we should try to take out our shoes and put both the feet like this,

00:30:41.778 --> 00:30:45.626
parallel, because left and right are two different energies.

00:30:53.615 --> 00:30:59.091
Even the other day a lady had so much objection in taking out her shoes.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.891
I just don’t understand.

00:31:09.086 --> 00:31:11.531
There are so many wrong things we are doing,

00:31:11.731 --> 00:31:14.355
people have no objection to that.

00:31:20.439 --> 00:31:23.443
So don’t pay attention to frivolous things.

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:32.261
Now, please put your left hand towards Me like this,

00:31:32.462 --> 00:31:35.011
which suggests symbolically

00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:38.611
that you desire to have your Realization.

00:31:46.485 --> 00:31:51.251
And those who do not want to have Realization should leave this hall,

00:31:55.689 --> 00:31:57.736
and leave others in peace,

00:31:59.405 --> 00:32:02.437
because they act negatively for others.

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:08.947
Now please put your left hand towards Me like this,

00:32:12.725 --> 00:32:16.344
and put the right hand on your heart.

00:32:18.215 --> 00:32:21.171
As I said, in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:32:24.571 --> 00:32:27.411
Then you have to put your right hand

00:32:27.756 --> 00:32:30.514
on the upper part your abdomen

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.715
on the left hand side.

00:32:37.648 --> 00:32:41.818
This is the centre of your mastery.

00:32:45.578 --> 00:32:50.285
Then you have to put your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

00:32:57.586 --> 00:33:00.971
This is the centre of

00:33:01.883 --> 00:33:06.847
the pure knowledge, manifesting through your central nervous system,

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.851
the knowledge of divine laws.

00:33:17.194 --> 00:33:21.011
Then again we go back in the upper part of the abdomen,

00:33:21.211 --> 00:33:23.222
on the left hand side.

00:33:26.523 --> 00:33:28.851
Then we go again to the heart.

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:33.731
Then we go, take our hand in

00:33:33.931 --> 00:33:38.051
the corner of your neck and turn your head to the right.

00:33:43.164 --> 00:33:46.531
This is the center which catches when you feel guilty

00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:50.011
and unnecessarily angry with yourself.

00:33:57.413 --> 00:34:00.828
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:06.531
Then we take our hand on

00:34:08.131 --> 00:34:12.891
top of our, I mean on our forehead across, like this,

00:34:13.091 --> 00:34:15.562
and press it on both the sides.

00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:24.668
Now we take this hand on the backside of our head,

00:34:24.868 --> 00:34:27.909
and put our head on this to rest and

00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:31.218
put it upward like that our head.

00:34:36.395 --> 00:34:41.611
Now we stretch our hand like this,

00:34:41.811 --> 00:34:44.269
and put the center of our hand,

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:48.091
on top of the fontanel bone area.

00:34:50.326 --> 00:34:52.318
Right hand, right hand.

00:34:56.022 --> 00:34:58.693
And now move it,

00:34:58.894 --> 00:35:00.894
your scalp.

00:35:07.084 --> 00:35:10.859
Seven times. Keep your fingers up like that.

00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:17.531
Now, please close your eyes.

00:35:19.204 --> 00:35:23.896
I have already requested people who
don’t want to do Sahaja Yoga, should go away.

00:35:24.097 --> 00:35:28.708
Please. There's not need to be so aggressive.

00:35:34.627 --> 00:35:36.627
Please.

00:35:39.015 --> 00:35:41.532
Still they don’t want to go; it’s very wrong

00:35:41.732 --> 00:35:43.732
and very aggressive.

00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:50.010
You cannot look at other people when you are not doing it.

00:36:13.161 --> 00:36:15.161
Thank you very much.

00:36:29.316 --> 00:36:31.900
Now, please close your eyes.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:39.731
Don’t open your eyes. Put both the feet parallel on the Mother Earth.

00:36:44.927 --> 00:36:48.069
Until I tell you don’t open your eyes.

00:36:51.152 --> 00:36:54.306
Now please put your left hand towards Me and right hand

00:36:54.507 --> 00:36:56.569
on your heart.

00:37:00.495 --> 00:37:05.171
Now here ask Me a very fundamental question.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:13.571
You may call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me Mother.

00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:16.633
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:19.371
Ask this question three times.

00:37:35.477 --> 00:37:40.371
Now, if you are the Spirit,

00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:42.488
you are your master.

00:37:42.689 --> 00:37:47.211
So put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

00:37:47.411 --> 00:37:50.611
the left hand side and ask another fundamental question,

00:37:50.811 --> 00:37:54.491
“Mother am I my own master?” Ask three times.

00:38:10.975 --> 00:38:13.171
Now you are free people.

00:38:13.371 --> 00:38:16.411
I cannot force on you anything,

00:38:16.611 --> 00:38:19.771
leave alone the pure knowledge of the Divine.

00:38:19.971 --> 00:38:22.491
So you have to ask for it.

00:38:32.808 --> 00:38:38.090
So please bring your right hand
in the lower part of your abdomen,

00:38:38.393 --> 00:38:40.412
in the left hand side.

00:38:44.403 --> 00:38:46.407
And now please say,

00:38:46.607 --> 00:38:51.460
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge of the Divine”.

00:38:57.695 --> 00:38:59.809
Please say it six times.

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.931
There are six petals to this center.

00:39:24.688 --> 00:39:29.762
Now as soon as you say these things,

00:39:29.962 --> 00:39:32.651
your Kundalini starts moving.

00:39:38.718 --> 00:39:41.411
To facilitate Her movement,

00:39:41.611 --> 00:39:45.114
please raise your hand to the upper center,

00:39:45.314 --> 00:39:50.676
which is in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

00:39:56.786 --> 00:40:00.251
Now, here, you have to say

00:40:01.062 --> 00:40:03.219
with full confidence

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.891
to facilitate the movement of the Kundalini,

00:40:07.818 --> 00:40:12.503
“Mother I am my own master”. Say it ten times.

00:40:37.092 --> 00:40:40.571
Now you have to know the greatest truth about you

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:45.006
is that you are the Spirit.

00:40:51.318 --> 00:40:55.427
You are not this body, you are not this conditioning,

00:40:55.627 --> 00:40:59.171
not this ego, not this mind.

00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:07.891
But you are the Spirit.

00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:12.731
So now please put your hand on your heart.

00:41:15.818 --> 00:41:18.331
And with full confidence say,

00:41:18.531 --> 00:41:22.411
twelve times, “Mother I am the Spirit”.

00:41:30.748 --> 00:41:32.902
Have full confidence.

00:42:05.226 --> 00:42:10.451
Now the Divine is the ocean of love

00:42:10.651 --> 00:42:12.311
and compassion.

00:42:12.511 --> 00:42:17.131
But above all It is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:42:25.708 --> 00:42:29.912
Above all it is the forgiveness,

00:42:30.112 --> 00:42:35.361
then you cannot make any mistakes which can’t be engulfed

00:42:35.561 --> 00:42:39.891
by this great power of forgiveness of God.

00:42:45.903 --> 00:42:48.931
So please first forgive yourself.

00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:55.032
You have to love yourself

00:42:55.232 --> 00:42:58.611
and you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:43:03.464 --> 00:43:08.411
Now put your hand on your shoulder

00:43:09.281 --> 00:43:13.651
between the neck and your shoulder,

00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:18.811
in the corner, and put your head to your right.

00:43:26.194 --> 00:43:28.731
Here now you have to say,

00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:31.011
with full confidence

00:43:31.968 --> 00:43:34.011
for sixteen times,

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:39.171
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:51.571
Sixteen times.

00:43:53.502 --> 00:43:57.091
Now those who still want to feel guilty can punish themselves

00:43:57.291 --> 00:43:59.728
by saying it 108 times.

00:44:36.677 --> 00:44:40.755
Now please take your hand

00:44:40.955 --> 00:44:43.611
on top of your forehead across

00:44:43.811 --> 00:44:46.291
and bend your head a little.

00:44:52.935 --> 00:44:55.371
Here you have to say

00:44:56.566 --> 00:44:58.811
from your heart,

00:44:59.085 --> 00:45:01.931
“Mother I forgive everyone”.

00:45:07.783 --> 00:45:12.211
If you say it is difficult to forgive then know that it is a myth,

00:45:12.411 --> 00:45:15.211
whether you forgive or if you don’t forgive.

00:45:21.034 --> 00:45:23.451
But if you do not forgive,

00:45:23.651 --> 00:45:26.331
then you play into wrong hands.

00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:33.342
Yesterday I saw many people didn’t get Realization,

00:45:33.542 --> 00:45:35.731
and when they came to Me and they said,

00:45:35.931 --> 00:45:40.091
“Mother I forgive everyone”, they got it. So please do it now.

00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:54.571
Forgive everything,

00:45:56.747 --> 00:45:58.747
everyone.

00:46:01.065 --> 00:46:04.811
Now, take your hand on the back side of your head

00:46:05.011 --> 00:46:09.039
and put back your head, resting on that hand.

00:46:15.467 --> 00:46:20.373
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

00:46:20.877 --> 00:46:22.971
“Mother”,

00:46:24.356 --> 00:46:26.891
or “the Divine

00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:30.749
if I have done any mistakes please forgive me”,

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:35.311
without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty.

00:46:51.055 --> 00:46:55.171
Now, stretch your hand

00:46:55.778 --> 00:46:57.691
straight,

00:46:58.656 --> 00:47:02.224
and put your centre of your palm

00:47:02.425 --> 00:47:04.811
on top of your head.

00:47:05.831 --> 00:47:09.251
Bend your head, stretch your fingers

00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:11.411
and press your scalp,

00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:15.558
move it seven times slowly.

00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:28.491
Bend your head please.

00:47:30.257 --> 00:47:33.396
Here also I cannot force you.

00:47:33.597 --> 00:47:35.918
So you have to say “Mother,

00:47:36.118 --> 00:47:39.990
please give me my Realization”, seven times.

00:48:29.009 --> 00:48:31.691
Now, take down your hand.

00:48:34.319 --> 00:48:36.331
Please open your eyes.

00:48:42.055 --> 00:48:44.851
Now put your right hand towards Me.

00:48:50.474 --> 00:48:52.331
Bend your head

00:48:54.851 --> 00:48:59.651
and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:49:10.487 --> 00:49:14.050
Now take your left hand like this.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:23.531
Put your right hand on top of your head

00:49:27.165 --> 00:49:30.971
and see for yourself if you are feeling the cool breeze.

00:49:34.866 --> 00:49:36.931
Bend your head a little.

00:50:02.388 --> 00:50:05.748
Now, again put your right hand towards Me

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:12.810
and see with your left hand if you can feel the cool breeze.

00:50:18.147 --> 00:50:20.531
Now raise your both the hands,

00:50:23.008 --> 00:50:25.818
high up. Raise your head.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:30.571
Bend it back and ask the question,

00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:34.491
“Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:50:39.147 --> 00:50:43.211
“Mother is this the Brahma Shakti?”

00:50:46.018 --> 00:50:50.170
“Mother is this the love of God?”

00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:57.169
Ask these questions three times.

00:51:07.055 --> 00:51:10.228
Now, bring down your hands please.

00:51:11.539 --> 00:51:13.691
Watch Me without thinking.

00:51:41.236 --> 00:51:44.771
Now those who have felt the cool breeze

00:51:45.804 --> 00:51:48.307
in the hands or in their heads,

00:51:48.507 --> 00:51:50.931
please raise both your hands.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.171
Most of those who came two days have got it.

00:52:12.348 --> 00:52:14.665
Those who have come only today,

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:16.865
may not have got it.

00:52:20.947 --> 00:52:23.764
So many of you have got your Realization.

00:52:26.587 --> 00:52:30.531
Now it is now like a sprouting of the seed.

00:52:34.871 --> 00:52:37.011
And you have to grow.

00:52:38.885 --> 00:52:41.459
We have got a centre here,

00:52:41.729 --> 00:52:46.024
where you should meet and grow.

00:52:46.224 --> 00:52:49.691
Within one month’s time you will be a master.

00:53:00.161 --> 00:53:04.451
You know we don’t take money, so we have very humble place.

00:53:09.089 --> 00:53:12.330
And you have to be very humble yourself.

00:53:16.207 --> 00:53:19.011
And please see that you all grow.

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:25.971
Some of you did not get Realization

00:53:28.782 --> 00:53:31.651
or maybe you did not feel the cool breeze,

00:53:33.795 --> 00:53:36.411
but might be feeling peaceful within.

00:53:38.864 --> 00:53:43.971
If this centre is out of gear also you don’t feel the vibrations.

00:53:49.922 --> 00:53:54.331
If you have not forgiven people, also you don’t feel the vibrations.

00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:02.891
So you have to take it up seriously.

00:54:06.431 --> 00:54:09.331
You are entering into a new world,

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:15.051
and not to be treated frivolously, childishly.

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:22.872
And I am sure all of you will develop that subtlety

00:54:26.969 --> 00:54:29.451
and all the powers

00:54:30.825 --> 00:54:34.425
by which you can to do miraculous things.

00:54:37.469 --> 00:54:41.234
I am sorry today there is short of time, so I have to go.

00:54:41.434 --> 00:54:44.411
But I hope you all will look after yourself.

00:54:50.062 --> 00:54:52.251
You have a very good,

00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:55.710
wise Sahaja Yogi here,

00:54:55.911 --> 00:54:59.771
who is the leader of Spanish people.

00:55:04.502 --> 00:55:07.251
You don’t have to spend any money.

00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:12.262
Only you have to pay attention to yourself

00:55:12.463 --> 00:55:17.063
and you have to attend the center.

00:55:24.364 --> 00:55:28.265
You cannot do it individually. It is a collective happening.

00:55:33.195 --> 00:55:37.331
Like one tree is supplying sap to all the leaves.

00:55:42.121 --> 00:55:45.532
The leaf that develops a bark between

00:55:45.732 --> 00:55:48.091
itself and the tree, falls off.

00:55:54.529 --> 00:55:56.915
With little patience with yourself,

00:55:57.115 --> 00:56:00.999
you will develop that subtle

00:56:02.458 --> 00:56:06.291
being within yourself, by which you will

00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:10.691
feel the joy of the Divine,

00:56:20.834 --> 00:56:22.931
which is your right,

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.651
which you all should have.

00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:29.401
May God bless you all.

00:56:35.083 --> 00:56:39.611
Only thing I have to request, that don’t talk to anyone now.

00:56:43.477 --> 00:56:46.651
Please go home in this silence

00:56:46.851 --> 00:56:49.491
and don’t discuss and argue.

00:56:54.777 --> 00:56:57.451
Because you lose your vibrations.

00:57:00.214 --> 00:57:05.371
So I have to request you not to argue it out. You cannot argue it.

00:57:08.277 --> 00:57:10.451
It has to work out.

00:57:12.313 --> 00:57:15.987
Those who have not got also should not blame anyone.

00:57:21.608 --> 00:57:23.608
May God bless you.

00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:32.375
Finished at ten o’clock as you said it.

00:57:39.666 --> 00:57:41.666
Where are My shoes?
