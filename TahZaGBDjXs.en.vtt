02:22.871 --> 02:26.171
﻿I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

02:34.581 --> 02:37.211
Yesterday as I told you,

02:37.411 --> 02:39.931
this is the knowledge of the roots.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.971
We have the knowledge of the tree.

02:52.871 --> 02:57.811
But if the tree grows and grows

02:58.011 --> 03:02.411
and does not pay attention to its roots,

03:03.940 --> 03:08.948
then there is always

03:10.388 --> 03:15.411
a definite stage where the tree gets destroyed.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.538
So the destruction is not going to come to us

03:29.773 --> 03:31.773
from outside.

03:31.971 --> 03:35.651
It is going to work out from within ourselves.

03:41.859 --> 03:44.220
Through various diseases,

03:44.421 --> 03:50.053
through various mishaps in our lives.

03:56.094 --> 04:00.017
It is important to see

04:00.217 --> 04:03.016
that you become the Spirit

04:03.217 --> 04:06.545
so that you will understand the mysteries of life.

04:15.524 --> 04:18.072
Even in the medical science

04:18.273 --> 04:21.851
there are many things which cannot be explained by them.

04:27.290 --> 04:29.371
Or in any science

04:29.571 --> 04:33.171
whatever theories are propounded are all the time challenged.

04:33.371 --> 04:35.382
They are not absolute.

04:41.676 --> 04:45.171
So there is something lacking in human awareness

04:45.371 --> 04:48.512
that we are not at an absolute point.

04:53.768 --> 04:58.091
Now this beautiful arrangement is made within ourselves

04:58.291 --> 05:01.171
during our evolutionary process.

05:07.623 --> 05:11.219
But when we go to the left or to the right,

05:11.420 --> 05:14.867
to the extremes, then what happens,

05:15.067 --> 05:18.371
is that our centers which are like this,

05:18.571 --> 05:20.573
get broken,

05:27.501 --> 05:31.458
and we lose the connection with the whole.

05:34.354 --> 05:37.171
As a result of that we develop

05:37.371 --> 05:41.002
diseases which are psychosomatic, may be physical,

05:41.202 --> 05:43.202
may be emotional.

05:48.669 --> 05:50.669
But the Kundalini,

05:51.073 --> 05:54.691
which is the vital force passes through the center

05:55.088 --> 05:58.811
and brings the broken centers together,

06:05.454 --> 06:08.571
and brings the attention in the center.

06:11.873 --> 06:15.511
When our attention is on the left or on the right,

06:15.712 --> 06:20.571
we go into different various funny experiences.

06:28.028 --> 06:30.960
Like when we go to the right side,

06:31.161 --> 06:34.811
we feel as if our body is

06:35.486 --> 06:38.487
somewhere and we are flying in the air.

06:46.616 --> 06:49.700
This we call as supraconscious experiences.

06:52.929 --> 06:55.451
People start seeing the future,

06:55.944 --> 06:57.944
living in the future.

07:01.399 --> 07:04.331
But they do not know how it happens.

07:06.879 --> 07:08.885
They have no control over it.

07:10.271 --> 07:12.291
They have no scientific knowledge of it.

07:15.070 --> 07:17.971
As if we are carried away by some force.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.971
On the left hand side if you move too much,

07:25.171 --> 07:27.560
then you develop,

07:27.761 --> 07:31.571
of course, horrible diseases which are psychosomatic.

07:38.101 --> 07:42.789
But also you become possessed by funny ideas

07:42.990 --> 07:47.132
and you start jumping and gesticulating and

07:47.332 --> 07:50.363
singing in a very miserable way.

07:57.798 --> 08:02.888
So within us all these problems lie on the extremes of our being.

08:08.540 --> 08:11.168
I’ll tell you how cancer is caused.

08:14.820 --> 08:18.571
Supposing the person is in the center

08:18.771 --> 08:21.531
there is no possibility of

08:22.199 --> 08:24.251
his getting into cancer.

08:30.379 --> 08:35.070
Supposing he goes too much to the right; he is over active, planning,

08:35.270 --> 08:37.270
futuristic man.

08:42.980 --> 08:47.611
Then his chakras move outward like this.

08:51.898 --> 08:55.091
Then he becomes vulnerable to cancer.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.611
Because his connection to the mains is lost.

09:05.429 --> 09:09.211
But now, supposing somehow or other

09:09.490 --> 09:14.291
he goes to the left, he gets a shock or meets with an accident

09:14.491 --> 09:17.971
or he meets a bad ‘guru’, he goes to the left,

09:24.925 --> 09:26.925
or he gets mesmerized.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.931
Then he is triggered into cancer.

09:37.307 --> 09:39.307
Now the doctors do say

09:39.508 --> 09:43.606
that cancer is caused by triggering of…

09:45.125 --> 09:47.628
they call it protein 52,

09:47.829 --> 09:51.251
protein 54, protein 58.

09:59.045 --> 10:01.838
52, 54, 58.

10:06.362 --> 10:08.611
These are just the names given by them.

10:10.961 --> 10:15.060
But they say that it is coming to us through the area

10:15.260 --> 10:18.571
which is built within us since our creation.

10:27.642 --> 10:31.531
That means there is an area which we call in Sahaja Yoga,

10:31.731 --> 10:34.282
as collective subconscious,

10:40.549 --> 10:44.291
where everything that is dead in the atmosphere

10:44.849 --> 10:46.849
is stored.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.997
From our creation.

10:53.918 --> 10:56.731
And when anything from there

10:57.327 --> 10:59.571
comes into our attention,

10:59.850 --> 11:02.371
we start developing cancer;

11:09.935 --> 11:12.952
because you have lost connection with the whole.

11:16.195 --> 11:21.290
You become, the cells become on their own.

11:26.556 --> 11:28.556
They start acting on their own.

11:30.818 --> 11:33.451
That becomes, they become malignant.

11:36.611 --> 11:40.291
Now supposing you can bring by any chance,

11:40.492 --> 11:42.640
this centre, again these two,

11:42.840 --> 11:46.358
two broken chakras into one centre,

11:52.418 --> 11:54.418
then cancer can be cured.

11:57.122 --> 12:02.197
Sahaja Yoga has cured many types of cancer inclusive of blood cancer.

12:07.616 --> 12:10.171
But it is your own power.

12:12.649 --> 12:17.711
It is nobody else’s power, it is your own power within you works it out.

12:22.673 --> 12:27.731
And it has been now proved even by doctors,

12:27.931 --> 12:32.091
as I told you yesterday that two doctors got their Phd,

12:32.291 --> 12:35.319
in Sahaja Yoga, from Delhi University.

12:42.830 --> 12:46.690
There is another thing we can discuss here about

12:46.891 --> 12:51.530
the diseases which are caused due to over activity of the mind.

12:58.048 --> 13:01.525
Here you can see in the centre is a round portion

13:01.726 --> 13:04.143
which we call as the ‘Void’.

13:08.670 --> 13:12.448
There resides the ten valences of human beings.

13:16.608 --> 13:20.211
And if these ten valances are enlightened

13:20.411 --> 13:23.497
you can never go into extremes.

13:29.711 --> 13:33.776
But when you are overactive and extremely

13:33.977 --> 13:36.571
futuristic then,

13:36.771 --> 13:40.610
there is a center there which is
called as ‘Swadishthana’, the second centre,

13:40.810 --> 13:43.371
has to work very hard;

13:52.332 --> 13:56.611
which actually looks after the aortic plexus in our stomach,

13:56.811 --> 13:59.576
in our viscera, in the stomach.

14:06.205 --> 14:10.331
Now this chakra has one very important work to do

14:10.531 --> 14:14.571
is to convert the fat of the stomach

14:14.771 --> 14:19.011
for the use of the brain which is the grey cells.

14:32.025 --> 14:35.491
But if you think too much and too much and too much,

14:35.691 --> 14:38.530
you need this replacement all the time.

14:43.050 --> 14:47.811
And this replacement is done by this chakra.

14:52.152 --> 14:55.410
Now this chakra has also other things to be done,

14:55.611 --> 14:57.611
like liver,

15:00.933 --> 15:03.815
it has to look after the spleen,

15:05.246 --> 15:07.246
the pancreas,

15:07.896 --> 15:09.930
and intestines.

15:11.028 --> 15:14.532
Also it has to look after the kidneys

15:14.733 --> 15:17.711
and the lower end of the large intestines.

15:22.877 --> 15:27.491
So when this gets busy with transforming

15:27.691 --> 15:32.400
the cells for the grey cells, fat cells into grey cells,

15:32.601 --> 15:35.666
it has no time for other functions.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.759
As a result of that you get a very bad liver.

15:53.176 --> 15:58.891
Your attention becomes very distorted.

16:03.670 --> 16:06.943
And all the time you feel uneasy.

16:12.278 --> 16:15.491
You don’t feel like eating your food, and even if you eat,

16:15.691 --> 16:17.691
you feel like vomiting it.

16:22.373 --> 16:25.563
But it can go further and you might get the cirrhosis of the liver,

16:25.763 --> 16:28.330
skin troubles all kinds of things.

16:36.104 --> 16:39.131
Specially, with a bad liver if you go for sun bathing,

16:39.331 --> 16:41.531
you are sure to get skin cancer.

16:50.047 --> 16:52.851
Too much oil and too much fatty foods

16:53.051 --> 16:55.451
if you eat also you get very bad liver.

17:01.167 --> 17:05.531
And maybe that you become very thin with it,

17:09.096 --> 17:14.091
because the liver cannot consume any fats in your body.

17:18.227 --> 17:22.211
Then there is also the pancreas,

17:22.617 --> 17:26.452
which is responsible for absorbing our sugar.

17:34.143 --> 17:36.601
That also goes out of order.

17:39.420 --> 17:42.884
As a result of that you develop diabetes.

17:45.743 --> 17:49.811
In an Indian village, a villager takes so much sugar

17:50.011 --> 17:54.349
that he says that the spoon must stand in the cup.

18:01.453 --> 18:04.116
But he never gets diabetes.

18:06.318 --> 18:09.731
Because he does not sit down and think too much.

18:12.684 --> 18:15.808
He deals with the life as it comes to him.

18:18.319 --> 18:23.062
And he is above too much of thinking.

18:26.222 --> 18:30.572
Then the third thing that happens to you is even more serious.

18:33.640 --> 18:38.331
The spleen that is responsible for attending to your emergencies

18:38.531 --> 18:42.211
produces more red blood corpuscles.

18:49.188 --> 18:51.771
Supposing you have taken some food

18:51.971 --> 18:54.521
and after that you start running immediately,

18:54.721 --> 18:57.365
you get a pain in that area.

19:04.400 --> 19:09.211
And that area becomes extremely sensitive.

19:12.284 --> 19:16.731
But in modern times, we are all the time giving shocks to our spleen,

19:21.210 --> 19:23.610
because our life is so hectic.

19:26.044 --> 19:30.051
Early in the morning we read the newspapers, horrible news, one shock.

19:35.084 --> 19:37.500
Then we are in a hurry, we have our lunch,

19:37.700 --> 19:40.771
somehow our breakfast somehow,

19:40.971 --> 19:44.531
get into the car, and then we see the big crowd

19:44.731 --> 19:47.771
of cars and a jam.

19:54.462 --> 19:56.462
Comes the second shock.

19:58.365 --> 20:02.718
And like that, we go on shocking our system all the time.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.731
Whatever arrogance human beings may have,

20:13.195 --> 20:16.131
whatever may they think of themselves,

20:18.195 --> 20:21.919
they must know that they are made very delicately

20:24.635 --> 20:26.635
and very carefully.

20:28.276 --> 20:31.276
They should not treat them like hippopotamus.

20:33.334 --> 20:35.334
They are human beings.

20:36.027 --> 20:39.107
And if they start treating themselves like that,

20:39.331 --> 20:44.095
they end up with horrible diseases like blood cancer.

20:49.793 --> 20:53.316
Then with the kidney you develop high blood pressures,

20:57.321 --> 21:00.171
then kidney non-functioning,

21:03.363 --> 21:05.363
then remove the kidney.

21:06.941 --> 21:08.941
You get constipated.

21:10.657 --> 21:15.560
All these things come to you because of over activity of the mind.

21:19.608 --> 21:23.208
Actually there is no need to plan too much.

21:26.831 --> 21:30.331
Because if you go on planning like this, it never works out.

21:33.911 --> 21:38.043
You must keep it open to see how it works out.

21:42.805 --> 21:46.811
I had… I was staying somewhere else, at one place,

21:47.011 --> 21:50.171
and I had to go to some place very far away.

21:51.402 --> 21:53.771
Now if I had gone all the way back,

21:53.971 --> 21:57.503
as planned, I would have never reached you.

22:08.424 --> 22:11.057
So I decided to come directly

22:13.804 --> 22:15.804
and it has worked,

22:17.420 --> 22:20.000
without disturbing my system.

22:21.802 --> 22:25.668
Now we have watches in our hands, and all the time looking at the watch

22:25.868 --> 22:28.617
and getting frightened of the time.

22:33.332 --> 22:35.332
We have to save time.

22:36.910 --> 22:38.910
But for what?

22:39.217 --> 22:43.451
Like somebody in India was very anxious to catch a plane

22:43.651 --> 22:46.711
and he wouldn’t get a ticket so he was very agitated.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.330
I said, “But what is so necessary?”

22:55.531 --> 22:58.448
He said, “I have to go and attend a ball”.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.680
Waste of time.

23:06.974 --> 23:11.931
For that he was so much jarring his own system.

23:16.774 --> 23:19.131
And when you hear such people,

23:19.331 --> 23:22.423
suddenly they collapse and die with heart.

23:27.243 --> 23:30.062
Because if you become too much right sided,

23:30.263 --> 23:33.431
the Spirit stops,

23:33.631 --> 23:38.556
He dies, in a sense that it never dies but it sleeps off. It disappears.

23:44.475 --> 23:47.141
Your heart becomes like a stone.

23:49.422 --> 23:52.070
With your arrogance it is even worse.

23:54.431 --> 23:58.058
And then the reflection of God is not there.

24:01.199 --> 24:04.726
Such people have no compassion, no love

24:05.024 --> 24:07.031
and no joy.

24:09.975 --> 24:12.225
They are joy killers.

24:14.463 --> 24:17.868
All this running about is for joy.

24:21.754 --> 24:24.369
But it’s a joyless pursuit.

24:26.731 --> 24:29.472
Then comes the left sided people,

24:32.213 --> 24:35.719
who indulges into nonsensical romances

24:38.788 --> 24:44.011
and indulge into all kinds of sufferings for nothing at all.

24:47.586 --> 24:51.891
Like in Paris, when I first went,
they said, “Mother, you look such a happy person.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.244
They are not going to like You.”

25:01.587 --> 25:05.079
They think that joyous people are ignorant.

25:07.898 --> 25:10.636
They don’t know what is happening in this world.

25:12.506 --> 25:16.331
So I started My lecture with “Les Miserable”.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.673
“Les Miserable”.

25:23.251 --> 25:25.451
If you have a pub

25:25.931 --> 25:29.291
at every fifth lamp post,

25:29.491 --> 25:34.121
and a bad women standing at every third lamp post in Paris,

25:34.371 --> 25:36.595
you are inviting trouble.

25:46.505 --> 25:50.931
You see a person coming out of a pub and falling off on the street,

25:51.300 --> 25:54.100
and you enter into the same pub.

26:00.789 --> 26:04.211
You see people getting into the trouble with

26:04.411 --> 26:06.731
funny sex habits,

26:08.829 --> 26:12.011
but still you want to do that, yourself.

26:20.068 --> 26:22.710
You are not a free person at all

26:24.306 --> 26:26.491
and neither you are powerful.

26:28.223 --> 26:32.771
You get tempted all the time to the forces of your destruction.

26:36.431 --> 26:39.571
So that you have no discretion either,

26:42.310 --> 26:44.971
nor understanding of your glory,

26:46.918 --> 26:48.930
nor of your beauty,

26:49.131 --> 26:53.654
that God had created you especially to enter into His kingdom.

26:58.968 --> 27:02.392
So we live in our own paradise of destruction,

27:05.775 --> 27:09.082
go on destroying ourselves gradually.

27:11.812 --> 27:14.089
Nothing gives us happiness.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.531
We run from

27:18.604 --> 27:22.968
place to place to find happiness and joy.

27:26.610 --> 27:30.691
Ultimately, I think, people have to put electrodes in their limbic area,

27:30.891 --> 27:33.600
to feel joy like the monkeys do.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.811
We don’t respect ourselves and we don’t try to understand ourselves.

27:48.788 --> 27:50.788
Why are we created?

27:53.216 --> 27:55.377
What is the purpose of our life?

27:57.282 --> 27:59.731
What do we have to get out of life?

28:02.296 --> 28:06.731
Such a ocean of joy is lying ahead

28:10.501 --> 28:13.481
and we do not want to go to it.

28:15.767 --> 28:18.803
This kind of things are happening

28:19.177 --> 28:24.091
and that is why yesterday I told that Spanish people should now rise

28:24.291 --> 28:28.503
and see and get the joy out of their lives.

28:36.027 --> 28:40.123
A little journey of three to four feet of the Kundalini

28:40.323 --> 28:43.255
brings forth this joy to you.

28:52.106 --> 28:56.771
So I have to make a request to you.

28:56.971 --> 28:58.991
As there is less time today,

28:59.192 --> 29:03.451
I won’t be asking for questions today.

29:03.651 --> 29:07.971
Yesterday we spent about one and a half an hour on useless questions.

29:17.516 --> 29:19.891
So better get your Realization.

29:22.372 --> 29:25.125
You don’t have to know all these things.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.996
As you don’t have to know about the electricity,

29:30.196 --> 29:33.811
you have to just put on the switch because it is all built in.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.910
May God bless you all!

29:42.780 --> 29:47.026
I come here every year and I am sure I will come next year also.

30:05.098 --> 30:09.887
It is little bit cooperation you have to give Me.

30:14.308 --> 30:17.931
As you have seen I have taken out the shoes

30:18.131 --> 30:21.074
because the Mother Earth helps us a lot.

30:26.676 --> 30:31.375
She sucks our problems much faster than we know of.

30:36.531 --> 30:41.578
So, we should try to take out our shoes and put both the feet like this,

30:41.778 --> 30:45.626
parallel, because left and right are two different energies.

30:53.615 --> 30:59.091
Even the other day a lady had so much objection in taking out her shoes.

31:04.650 --> 31:06.891
I just don’t understand.

31:09.086 --> 31:11.531
There are so many wrong things we are doing,

31:11.731 --> 31:14.355
people have no objection to that.

31:20.439 --> 31:23.443
So don’t pay attention to frivolous things.

31:27.029 --> 31:32.261
Now, please put your left hand towards Me like this,

31:32.462 --> 31:35.011
which suggests symbolically

31:35.211 --> 31:38.611
that you desire to have your Realization.

31:46.485 --> 31:51.251
And those who do not want to have Realization should leave this hall,

31:55.689 --> 31:57.736
and leave others in peace,

31:59.405 --> 32:02.437
because they act negatively for others.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.947
Now please put your left hand towards Me like this,

32:12.725 --> 32:16.344
and put the right hand on your heart.

32:18.215 --> 32:21.171
As I said, in the heart resides the Spirit.

32:24.571 --> 32:27.411
Then you have to put your right hand

32:27.756 --> 32:30.514
on the upper part your abdomen

32:30.715 --> 32:32.715
on the left hand side.

32:37.648 --> 32:41.818
This is the centre of your mastery.

32:45.578 --> 32:50.285
Then you have to put your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

32:57.586 --> 33:00.971
This is the centre of

33:01.883 --> 33:06.847
the pure knowledge, manifesting through your central nervous system,

33:12.300 --> 33:14.851
the knowledge of divine laws.

33:17.194 --> 33:21.011
Then again we go back in the upper part of the abdomen,

33:21.211 --> 33:23.222
on the left hand side.

33:26.523 --> 33:28.851
Then we go again to the heart.

33:30.808 --> 33:33.731
Then we go, take our hand in

33:33.931 --> 33:38.051
the corner of your neck and turn your head to the right.

33:43.164 --> 33:46.531
This is the center which catches when you feel guilty

33:46.731 --> 33:50.011
and unnecessarily angry with yourself.

33:57.413 --> 34:00.828
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

34:02.859 --> 34:06.531
Then we take our hand on

34:08.131 --> 34:12.891
top of our, I mean on our forehead across, like this,

34:13.091 --> 34:15.562
and press it on both the sides.

34:20.475 --> 34:24.668
Now we take this hand on the backside of our head,

34:24.868 --> 34:27.909
and put our head on this to rest and

34:28.109 --> 34:31.218
put it upward like that our head.

34:36.395 --> 34:41.611
Now we stretch our hand like this,

34:41.811 --> 34:44.269
and put the center of our hand,

34:44.469 --> 34:48.091
on top of the fontanel bone area.

34:50.326 --> 34:52.318
Right hand, right hand.

34:56.022 --> 34:58.693
And now move it,

34:58.894 --> 35:00.894
your scalp.

35:07.084 --> 35:10.859
Seven times. Keep your fingers up like that.

35:14.741 --> 35:17.531
Now, please close your eyes.

35:19.204 --> 35:23.896
I have already requested people who
don’t want to do Sahaja Yoga, should go away.

35:24.097 --> 35:28.708
Please. There's not need to be so aggressive.

35:34.627 --> 35:36.627
Please.

35:39.015 --> 35:41.532
Still they don’t want to go; it’s very wrong

35:41.732 --> 35:43.732
and very aggressive.

35:46.602 --> 35:50.010
You cannot look at other people when you are not doing it.

36:13.161 --> 36:15.161
Thank you very much.

36:29.316 --> 36:31.900
Now, please close your eyes.

36:35.050 --> 36:39.731
Don’t open your eyes. Put both the feet parallel on the Mother Earth.

36:44.927 --> 36:48.069
Until I tell you don’t open your eyes.

36:51.152 --> 36:54.306
Now please put your left hand towards Me and right hand

36:54.507 --> 36:56.569
on your heart.

37:00.495 --> 37:05.171
Now here ask Me a very fundamental question.

37:09.490 --> 37:13.571
You may call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me Mother.

37:13.771 --> 37:16.633
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

37:16.833 --> 37:19.371
Ask this question three times.

37:35.477 --> 37:40.371
Now, if you are the Spirit,

37:40.571 --> 37:42.488
you are your master.

37:42.689 --> 37:47.211
So put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

37:47.411 --> 37:50.611
the left hand side and ask another fundamental question,

37:50.811 --> 37:54.491
“Mother am I my own master?” Ask three times.

38:10.975 --> 38:13.171
Now you are free people.

38:13.371 --> 38:16.411
I cannot force on you anything,

38:16.611 --> 38:19.771
leave alone the pure knowledge of the Divine.

38:19.971 --> 38:22.491
So you have to ask for it.

38:32.808 --> 38:38.090
So please bring your right hand
in the lower part of your abdomen,

38:38.393 --> 38:40.412
in the left hand side.

38:44.403 --> 38:46.407
And now please say,

38:46.607 --> 38:51.460
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge of the Divine”.

38:57.695 --> 38:59.809
Please say it six times.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.931
There are six petals to this center.

39:24.688 --> 39:29.762
Now as soon as you say these things,

39:29.962 --> 39:32.651
your Kundalini starts moving.

39:38.718 --> 39:41.411
To facilitate Her movement,

39:41.611 --> 39:45.114
please raise your hand to the upper center,

39:45.314 --> 39:50.676
which is in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

39:56.786 --> 40:00.251
Now, here, you have to say

40:01.062 --> 40:03.219
with full confidence

40:03.420 --> 40:06.891
to facilitate the movement of the Kundalini,

40:07.818 --> 40:12.503
“Mother I am my own master”. Say it ten times.

40:37.092 --> 40:40.571
Now you have to know the greatest truth about you

40:40.771 --> 40:45.006
is that you are the Spirit.

40:51.318 --> 40:55.427
You are not this body, you are not this conditioning,

40:55.627 --> 40:59.171
not this ego, not this mind.

41:05.738 --> 41:07.891
But you are the Spirit.

41:08.916 --> 41:12.731
So now please put your hand on your heart.

41:15.818 --> 41:18.331
And with full confidence say,

41:18.531 --> 41:22.411
twelve times, “Mother I am the Spirit”.

41:30.748 --> 41:32.902
Have full confidence.

42:05.226 --> 42:10.451
Now the Divine is the ocean of love

42:10.651 --> 42:12.311
and compassion.

42:12.511 --> 42:17.131
But above all It is the ocean of forgiveness.

42:25.708 --> 42:29.912
Above all it is the forgiveness,

42:30.112 --> 42:35.361
then you cannot make any mistakes which can’t be engulfed

42:35.561 --> 42:39.891
by this great power of forgiveness of God.

42:45.903 --> 42:48.931
So please first forgive yourself.

42:53.029 --> 42:55.032
You have to love yourself

42:55.232 --> 42:58.611
and you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

43:03.464 --> 43:08.411
Now put your hand on your shoulder

43:09.281 --> 43:13.651
between the neck and your shoulder,

43:13.851 --> 43:18.811
in the corner, and put your head to your right.

43:26.194 --> 43:28.731
Here now you have to say,

43:28.931 --> 43:31.011
with full confidence

43:31.968 --> 43:34.011
for sixteen times,

43:34.211 --> 43:39.171
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

43:49.311 --> 43:51.571
Sixteen times.

43:53.502 --> 43:57.091
Now those who still want to feel guilty can punish themselves

43:57.291 --> 43:59.728
by saying it 108 times.

44:36.677 --> 44:40.755
Now please take your hand

44:40.955 --> 44:43.611
on top of your forehead across

44:43.811 --> 44:46.291
and bend your head a little.

44:52.935 --> 44:55.371
Here you have to say

44:56.566 --> 44:58.811
from your heart,

44:59.085 --> 45:01.931
“Mother I forgive everyone”.

45:07.783 --> 45:12.211
If you say it is difficult to forgive then know that it is a myth,

45:12.411 --> 45:15.211
whether you forgive or if you don’t forgive.

45:21.034 --> 45:23.451
But if you do not forgive,

45:23.651 --> 45:26.331
then you play into wrong hands.

45:30.367 --> 45:33.342
Yesterday I saw many people didn’t get Realization,

45:33.542 --> 45:35.731
and when they came to Me and they said,

45:35.931 --> 45:40.091
“Mother I forgive everyone”, they got it. So please do it now.

45:52.231 --> 45:54.571
Forgive everything,

45:56.747 --> 45:58.747
everyone.

46:01.065 --> 46:04.811
Now, take your hand on the back side of your head

46:05.011 --> 46:09.039
and put back your head, resting on that hand.

46:15.467 --> 46:20.373
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

46:20.877 --> 46:22.971
“Mother”,

46:24.356 --> 46:26.891
or “the Divine

46:27.091 --> 46:30.749
if I have done any mistakes please forgive me”,

46:30.950 --> 46:35.311
without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty.

46:51.055 --> 46:55.171
Now, stretch your hand

46:55.778 --> 46:57.691
straight,

46:58.656 --> 47:02.224
and put your centre of your palm

47:02.425 --> 47:04.811
on top of your head.

47:05.831 --> 47:09.251
Bend your head, stretch your fingers

47:09.451 --> 47:11.411
and press your scalp,

47:11.611 --> 47:15.558
move it seven times slowly.

47:26.426 --> 47:28.491
Bend your head please.

47:30.257 --> 47:33.396
Here also I cannot force you.

47:33.597 --> 47:35.918
So you have to say “Mother,

47:36.118 --> 47:39.990
please give me my Realization”, seven times.

48:29.009 --> 48:31.691
Now, take down your hand.

48:34.319 --> 48:36.331
Please open your eyes.

48:42.055 --> 48:44.851
Now put your right hand towards Me.

48:50.474 --> 48:52.331
Bend your head

48:54.851 --> 48:59.651
and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

49:10.487 --> 49:14.050
Now take your left hand like this.

49:19.740 --> 49:23.531
Put your right hand on top of your head

49:27.165 --> 49:30.971
and see for yourself if you are feeling the cool breeze.

49:34.866 --> 49:36.931
Bend your head a little.

50:02.388 --> 50:05.748
Now, again put your right hand towards Me

50:08.810 --> 50:12.810
and see with your left hand if you can feel the cool breeze.

50:18.147 --> 50:20.531
Now raise your both the hands,

50:23.008 --> 50:25.818
high up. Raise your head.

50:27.250 --> 50:30.571
Bend it back and ask the question,

50:30.771 --> 50:34.491
“Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

50:39.147 --> 50:43.211
“Mother is this the Brahma Shakti?”

50:46.018 --> 50:50.170
“Mother is this the love of God?”

50:54.969 --> 50:57.169
Ask these questions three times.

51:07.055 --> 51:10.228
Now, bring down your hands please.

51:11.539 --> 51:13.691
Watch Me without thinking.

51:41.236 --> 51:44.771
Now those who have felt the cool breeze

51:45.804 --> 51:48.307
in the hands or in their heads,

51:48.507 --> 51:50.931
please raise both your hands.

52:04.100 --> 52:08.171
Most of those who came two days have got it.

52:12.348 --> 52:14.665
Those who have come only today,

52:14.865 --> 52:16.865
may not have got it.

52:20.947 --> 52:23.764
So many of you have got your Realization.

52:26.587 --> 52:30.531
Now it is now like a sprouting of the seed.

52:34.871 --> 52:37.011
And you have to grow.

52:38.885 --> 52:41.459
We have got a centre here,

52:41.729 --> 52:46.024
where you should meet and grow.

52:46.224 --> 52:49.691
Within one month’s time you will be a master.

53:00.161 --> 53:04.451
You know we don’t take money, so we have very humble place.

53:09.089 --> 53:12.330
And you have to be very humble yourself.

53:16.207 --> 53:19.011
And please see that you all grow.

53:23.099 --> 53:25.971
Some of you did not get Realization

53:28.782 --> 53:31.651
or maybe you did not feel the cool breeze,

53:33.795 --> 53:36.411
but might be feeling peaceful within.

53:38.864 --> 53:43.971
If this centre is out of gear also you don’t feel the vibrations.

53:49.922 --> 53:54.331
If you have not forgiven people, also you don’t feel the vibrations.

53:59.403 --> 54:02.891
So you have to take it up seriously.

54:06.431 --> 54:09.331
You are entering into a new world,

54:11.340 --> 54:15.051
and not to be treated frivolously, childishly.

54:18.655 --> 54:22.872
And I am sure all of you will develop that subtlety

54:26.969 --> 54:29.451
and all the powers

54:30.825 --> 54:34.425
by which you can to do miraculous things.

54:37.469 --> 54:41.234
I am sorry today there is short of time, so I have to go.

54:41.434 --> 54:44.411
But I hope you all will look after yourself.

54:50.062 --> 54:52.251
You have a very good,

54:52.609 --> 54:55.710
wise Sahaja Yogi here,

54:55.911 --> 54:59.771
who is the leader of Spanish people.

55:04.502 --> 55:07.251
You don’t have to spend any money.

55:09.331 --> 55:12.262
Only you have to pay attention to yourself

55:12.463 --> 55:17.063
and you have to attend the center.

55:24.364 --> 55:28.265
You cannot do it individually. It is a collective happening.

55:33.195 --> 55:37.331
Like one tree is supplying sap to all the leaves.

55:42.121 --> 55:45.532
The leaf that develops a bark between

55:45.732 --> 55:48.091
itself and the tree, falls off.

55:54.529 --> 55:56.915
With little patience with yourself,

55:57.115 --> 56:00.999
you will develop that subtle

56:02.458 --> 56:06.291
being within yourself, by which you will

56:06.491 --> 56:10.691
feel the joy of the Divine,

56:20.834 --> 56:22.931
which is your right,

56:23.980 --> 56:26.651
which you all should have.

56:27.401 --> 56:29.401
May God bless you all.

56:35.083 --> 56:39.611
Only thing I have to request, that don’t talk to anyone now.

56:43.477 --> 56:46.651
Please go home in this silence

56:46.851 --> 56:49.491
and don’t discuss and argue.

56:54.777 --> 56:57.451
Because you lose your vibrations.

57:00.214 --> 57:05.371
So I have to request you not to argue it out. You cannot argue it.

57:08.277 --> 57:10.451
It has to work out.

57:12.313 --> 57:15.987
Those who have not got also should not blame anyone.

57:21.608 --> 57:23.608
May God bless you.

57:29.431 --> 57:32.375
Finished at ten o’clock as you said it.

57:39.666 --> 57:41.666
Where are My shoes?
