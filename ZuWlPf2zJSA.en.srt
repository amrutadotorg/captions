1
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:22,217
(…) what is our job is to worship Mahakali
within us,

2
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:27,259
because what does She do - perhaps we
are not very aware of.

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,467
First and foremost thing She does is
to protect us.

4
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,884
Wherever you may be, whatever you may
be doing,

5
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:40,176
in whatever peril you may be,

6
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:46,209
howsoever dangerously you may be placed 
in life, She protects you.

7
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,759
First thing, She protects you.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,384
All the people who write to Me how they 
were protected,

9
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,944
how they were cured, how they were
helped,

10
00:00:56,145 --> 00:01:00,701
is this thing: that they should know that 
all this has happened

11
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:04,594
because of Mahakali Power within you.

12
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:07,092
She exists within you.

13
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:11,749
When you are worshipping Mahakali you
are worshipping the Mahakali within you.

14
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,905
With due respect you must know that
this Mahakali

15
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:20,282
is a very sensitive personality. She is
very sensitive.

16
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:25,306
If you try to do any wrong to anyone,

17
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,040
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell you by many
ways

18
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:33,744
that this is wrong you are doing - why you
are doing wrong to some person?

19
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:38,680
But if you do not repent and come back
onto the normal position,

20
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:43,266
She gives you up. Once Mahakali gives
you up

21
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:49,680
you are now exposed and become prone
to all kinds of evil things.

22
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:57,747
(…) So when you worship Her, what do
you want - you want Her to protect you.

23
00:01:57,948 --> 00:02:01,597
In your discrimination, in your mistake

24
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:06,492
you might do something wrong; 
may do something

25
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:12,445
that is not good for you, could be very
dangerous for you.

26
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:19,123
But She’s the person who guides you
how to avoid all the dangers.

27
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:25,240
Now, She protects your life, She protects
your body,

28
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:28,441
She protects all organs of your body.

29
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:34,293
She’s the One who gives you all
the security of life.

30
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:40,203
In Her realm you feel completely secure.

31
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:43,221
You are never afraid of anything.

32
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:47,123
Because you have left Her realm, you have
come out of it,

33
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:50,392
that’s why, that is the reason you are
afraid.

34
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:58,460
But if you are under Her beautiful guidance
and Her blessings,

35
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:02,093
you will never feel afraid to do anything.

36
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:04,664
You’ll never do anything wrong also.

37
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:08,701
As soon as you’ll try to do wrong
She’ll hold your hand.

38
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:15,870
She’s really the guiding person. She’s the
One who actually gives us our existence.

39
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,761
Without Her we cannot exist,

40
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:29,263
because She is the One who is the power
of Shri Shiva.

41
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,268
She gives us so many things.

42
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:41,499
For example, She gives us the relaxation,
the sleep.

43
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,055
She gives you the truth. She tells you
what is the truth and what is not.

44
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:52,262
Sometimes people, so much in their ego
always, try to believe that,

45
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:55,833
“What I think is the truth.” Then She’s
the One

46
00:03:56,034 --> 00:04:04,914
who points it out by creating a maya,
a kind of a confusion,

47
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:08,489
that you start thinking, “What is this?”

48
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,068
So She is called also the One who gives
us bhranti, means “illusions”.

49
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,611
She puts you to illusions also, She tests
you -

50
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:24,516
puts you to illusions, and She then
ultimately takes you out of the illusions.

51
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:30,540
She’s the One who relaxes you, because
She takes over all your responsibilities,

52
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:35,452
She takes over all your problems. She’s
the One who solves all the problems.

53
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:40,074
It is we who forget to leave all
the problems to Her.

54
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:45,208
If you just leave problems to Her, all your
problems are solved.

55
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:49,260
Not only that but you really feel blessed.

56
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:53,706
It’s not only physical, also it is mental,

57
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:58,305
that She makes your mind absolutely
free of worries.

58
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:03,123
She doesn’t worry and She doesn’t want
you to worry.

59
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:06,945
If you worry then She tries to show
that by your worrying

60
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:12,247
you are denying Her, you are not accepting
Her.

61
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:14,563
Worrying is something is very common,

62
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:18,032
and people take great pride in saying,
“Oh, I was worried.”

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,068
How can you be worried when your Mother
is sakshat Mahakali?

64
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,929
She can kill all the demons, She can finish
all of them,

65
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,281
She knows how to manage things; and when
you are like a child before Her,

66
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,728
how can you worry about anything?

67
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:37,615
So your worries are finished.

68
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:40,916
She worries about you, you shouldn’t
worry about yourself.

69
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:45,789
That’s the point is. Her security is
so great,

70
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:53,542
She’s so secure Herself that She gives you
all the security that you need.

71
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:59,227
You can hold on to Her Feet, you can hold
on to Her image

72
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:02,914
or to anything. You can even pray to Her.

73
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:09,455
Many people are being cured only by
praying to Her, because She cures you.

74
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:15,686
She can cure your diseases which are very
complicated diseases, She can cure.

75
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:21,081
Now what She likes, Mahakali likes
the light.

76
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:25,643
She is worshipped in the night because
then we can put on the lights.

77
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:32,257
She like enlightened person, also She likes
the light, She likes the sun,

78
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:39,958
She likes something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

79
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:44,580
You must have heard about people who are
called I don’t know what,

80
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:49,962
but specially in the West they use them:

81
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:56,580
they have big teeth and they - ha,

82
00:06:56,781 --> 00:07:04,664
and they are the people, they - just
imagine - they cannot exist before the sun.

83
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:10,706
As soon as there is a sunrise they just
want to go off and sleep,

84
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:16,039
whilst they cannot see the sun, because
the light they can’t bear.

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,622
Now what has happened here that
Mahalakshmi has departed…

86
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:24,123
Mahakali has departed from them,

87
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:29,248
and when Mahakali has departed then
they are afraid;

88
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:36,706
and such people are attacked by these
people who know they are afraid.

89
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:44,161
The sun itself is very important to work
out this Mahakali thing.

90
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:51,747
But as it is in the West specially, we are
very hard-working

91
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:56,622
and very much sun-oriented and we
worship the sun.

92
00:07:56,823 --> 00:08:01,164
All this we do: worship the sun

93
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:04,547
and also go right-sided very much.

94
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,304
Then it is She who gives us the balance.

95
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:15,874
She’s the One who gives us the balance by
relaxing us completely and protecting us.

96
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:21,462
Sometimes we are competitive and we are
really worried,

97
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:26,330
and we want to do something which we
cannot do.

98
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:32,158
Then we get upset and we don’t know
what to do.

99
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:37,242
Then it is She who brings sleep to us.

100
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:40,585
So when we sleep She looks after us,

101
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:45,227
She soothes us and She takes away
our problems.

102
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:47,437
So many things She is doing.

103
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:51,622
But what are we doing for Her, that we
should see.

104
00:08:51,823 --> 00:09:00,333
Main thing is that we are ourselves 
worshipping Her.

105
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:06,539
She likes that Her children should worship
Her,

106
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,215
that on that level She can be one with
them.

107
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:18,032
She can give them Her compassion, love
and protection from all the evil.

108
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:24,412
But it has to be understood those who are
not yet settled,

109
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:28,375
those who are not yet absolutely belonging

110
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:36,406
to that land of security of Mahakali can be
attacked,

111
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:40,774
and they, once they leave that area,
they can be

112
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:47,914
very badly injured, killed, whatever may
can happen.

113
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:56,297
So we are living in this Kali Yuga in
a very dangerous times

114
00:09:56,498 --> 00:10:01,747
whence anything can happen, so we have
to be very careful.

115
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:06,240
We have to watch our mind to see how
it works.

116
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:09,950
What does it teach you? What does it
tell you?

117
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:18,083
Try to understand: what is the plan of this
evil person,

118
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,998
that you are playing into his hands? How 
can you play into his hands,

119
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,580
and how can you do whatever wrong
he wants you to do?

120
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:32,203
Secondly, against Her is the ego.

121
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:36,075
The biggest problem is the ego today,

122
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:39,249
ego which shows, “No, no, I can do this.”

123
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:46,187
Ego says, “I will work it out.” Ego says,
“It will be done.”

124
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:50,956
But the human beings, see, yield to ego.

125
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:55,990
It’s of a great satisfaction for them
that their ego is so strong,

126
00:10:56,191 --> 00:11:01,599
and they don’t want to listen to
the Mahakali forces.

127
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,625
(…) You have to be like children. Really,

128
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:08,429
that’s the very best way is to be innocent
like children.

129
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,078
She loves innocent people. She’s innocence
Herself.

130
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,985
She loves innocent people, and She looks
after you

131
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:20,302
much more because you are innocent,
you are not cunning,

132
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:30,302
you are not very much trying to play
your ego on others.

133
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:35,927
If you are innocent She’ll helps you,
She definitely will help you;

134
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,672
but this ego has to be brought under
control,

135
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:46,953
because he is the worst enemy She has.
She doesn’t like your ego.

136
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:50,366
She wants you to be egoless, to be
innocent.

137
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,377
(…) Then another thing She loves in you
is your compassion:

138
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:00,377
compassion for each other, love for
each other,

139
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:03,727
also caring for others.

140
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:07,383
That is something She loves. If you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

141
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:10,669
if you are a realized soul, She’s always
with you.

142
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,836
But She says, “What are you doing with
your compassion?

143
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:18,359
How many people you are giving Realization?

144
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,695
How many people you are curing, how many
people you are helping?”

145
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:28,288
She is quite aware of whatever you are
doing.

146
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:33,003
I should say it’s such a tremendous power
of Mahakali

147
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:36,867
that She knows everything about you -
everything.

148
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:40,891
She knows your mind, She knows your heart,

149
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:44,531
She knows about your health, everything
She knows;

150
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:49,100
actually She is the Mother in every way

151
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:54,265
who cares for the little child. In that way
She knows

152
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:57,709
that this child doesn’t do anything,
he’s very innocent.

153
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,384
So like when you are very small your mother
looks after you,

154
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:06,146
in the same way this Mahakali looks after
you.

155
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:10,541
(…) Everywhere in your life She is there.

156
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:15,242
Specially with Sahaja Yogis, She follows
them up and down,

157
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,639
everywhere, whatever you are doing.

158
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,586
You are in an accident - She is there
to save you.

159
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:25,679
She is like an angel behind you, and
nothing can happen to you

160
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,510
if you really worship Her from your full
heart:

161
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:34,478
not for any gain, not for any achievement,

162
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,392
but for Her blessings. Her blessings are
very great

163
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:47,360
and they really have enriched human beings.
They have enriched this earth.

164
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:53,896
They have enriched everything because
of the blessings of Mahakali.

165
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:57,593
(…) It will be the best way is to meditate.

166
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:01,492
Not to be aggressive in any way, but just
to meditate

167
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:06,011
and ask Mahakali, “Destroy, destroy him,

168
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,260
for he’s destroying the world. You please
destroy.”

169
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,672
That’s Her job and She would love to do,

170
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:14,712
but somebody has to tell Her, and ask Her.

171
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:18,086
It’s very good, because there are so many

172
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:21,430
that unless and until you point it out,
She may not be able

173
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:24,028
to put Her attention to them, possibly.

174
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:28,765
So it’s best is always ask Her to help you,

175
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:32,554
on individual basis, on a national basis,

176
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:37,503
maybe in a collective basis or maybe
in a global basis.

177
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:42,803
That’s what She exists everywhere,
She is globally available.

178
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:47,242
Anywhere you may be having any color,
any race,

179
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:53,837
any nation, anything; but She exists within
you all the time,

180
00:14:54,045 --> 00:15:01,561
and to worship Her and to awaken Her
is only your due that you have to do.

181
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:07,957
(…) You have to do it in a way that is
a innocent act,

182
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,617
that you are worshipping your Mother
like a little child

183
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:15,795
worships and loves its mother. It’s a very
simple relationship

184
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:19,719
which all of us have felt it, how we should
love our mother

185
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,336
and how we should be under her guidance
and under her protection.

186
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:30,207
That is something very simple you have
known in your childhood,

187
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:36,416
and that childhood has to come back in you,
if you really worship the Mother.

188
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:39,990
May God bless you.
