WEBVTT

00:22.427 --> 00:27.519
You are all ready to get married

00:27.720 --> 00:33.314
and I bless you from My heart.

00:34.960 --> 00:40.416
Now, the duty of a wife I need not tell
you, you know it very well.

00:40.617 --> 00:49.022
I've told many a times that she is
responsible to build the society of Sahaj.

00:49.618 --> 00:54.119
And as a result, she has [a] very great
responsibility.

00:54.320 --> 01:01.653
She has to look after the whole family,
the relations of [the] husband,

01:01.854 --> 01:13.851
and should go up to the great expectations
of the family members also.

01:14.052 --> 01:17.833
This can be done if you have really love
for people.

01:18.034 --> 01:22.304
If you have love, you wlll have tolerance
and you’ll be able

01:22.505 --> 01:27.960
to bring more people in Sahaja Yoga who
are related to you and to your husband

01:28.161 --> 01:35.892
by showing a very good household that
you have created.

01:40.487 --> 01:45.625
Towards the husband you have to be
very dedicated

01:45.826 --> 01:52.705
and don’t tell him about your past.
Past is finished and start afresh.

01:52.906 --> 01:58.042
It’s a very dangerous thing to say anything
about your past to your husband.

01:58.243 --> 02:07.939
So, you have your expectations, so he too
has his own expectations about you.

02:08.140 --> 02:12.389
Expectations should not be there
in Sahaja Yoga.

02:12.590 --> 02:19.194
But gradually, if you understand the value
of your marriage and you respect it,

02:19.395 --> 02:23.496
then you will not go after superficial
things.

02:23.697 --> 02:33.359
You’ll not ask him to buy this, buy that
for you on a material level.

02:33.629 --> 02:40.271
But also on the mental level you should
not try to judge him,

02:40.480 --> 02:44.085
but as you are spiritual, he is also
spiritual.

02:44.286 --> 02:47.451
So, you should see his vibrations.

02:47.652 --> 02:54.323
Don’t tell him but try to correct it slowly
and steadily.

02:54.524 --> 03:02.371
It’s easy to complain about married life,
very easy, and it’s [a] very common thing.

03:02.572 --> 03:06.959
If there are two ladies who are
dissatisfied with their married life,

03:07.160 --> 03:15.909
can create a big number of people who
will be complaining about marriages.

03:16.110 --> 03:23.060
So, one has to be very watchful and
careful not to indulge into gossips

03:23.261 --> 03:29.717
and talking about some things which has
no meaning in Sahaja Yoga.

03:29.918 --> 03:34.869
Going to the higher life, we have to see
that, as we are spiritual people

03:35.070 --> 03:38.843
we have to keep our spirituality growing
and growing

03:39.044 --> 03:42.838
so that great souls who want to be born
on this earth

03:43.039 --> 03:46.043
will take birth in your families.

03:46.244 --> 03:49.543
But that doesn’t mean, if you just get
attached to your own child,

03:49.744 --> 03:53.815
then others' children are not to be loved.

03:54.016 --> 03:59.447
Love doesn’t limit you, so you have to love
others' children also.

03:59.648 --> 04:02.800
The guests who come in your house,
you must look after.

04:03.001 --> 04:05.701
It is your duty to look after the guests.

04:05.902 --> 04:12.610
They are Sahaja Yogis, you have no business
to insult them or to trouble them.

04:12.811 --> 04:19.270
Your successful married life is going
to help so many people in this world.

04:19.471 --> 04:24.608
We have to show that Sahaja Yoga marriages
are extremely successful,

04:24.809 --> 04:28.827
peaceful and full of joy.

04:29.028 --> 04:33.317
If you want to find faults, you see,
there [is] no end to it.

04:33.518 --> 04:38.619
But it’s better to see your own faults
and correct yourself.

04:38.820 --> 04:47.729
Of course, if there is any problem which is
not soluble, which is absolutely difficult,

04:47.930 --> 04:53.279
then you can let Me know and I’ll try
to solve it if possible.

04:53.480 --> 04:59.219
Otherwise, you can depart. But it’s a very
last, extreme case.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.826
It’s the wife who makes the family,
she makes the marriage very good.

05:04.027 --> 05:08.593
So, it is for you to decide. Now, even now,
there is time,

05:08.794 --> 05:11.886
if you don’t want to marry, you don’t like
your husbands

05:12.087 --> 05:16.164
or in any way you think he is not
all right, you can decide now.

05:16.365 --> 05:20.303
There is time still for you to decide.

05:20.504 --> 05:24.753
We have to prove that our marriages,
Indian marriages,

05:24.954 --> 05:30.242
are not Indian: they are universal
marriages,

05:30.443 --> 05:37.599
and they are to be treated with that great
sense of responsibility.

05:38.823 --> 05:45.067
Once you understand your responsibility,
I’m sure you will know what is to be done.

05:45.268 --> 05:51.550
Firstly, you should never argue with your
husband, as far as possible.

05:51.751 --> 05:59.463
You should not shout at him; you should
not be disrespectful for him before others.

05:59.664 --> 06:03.969
And relationship between you and your
husband is a secret;

06:04.170 --> 06:10.114
it should not be discussed
on the cross-roads, you see.

06:10.315 --> 06:14.985
Let people see for themselves how happy
you are.

06:15.186 --> 06:17.730
But there is no need to be artificially
happy.

06:17.931 --> 06:20.402
There is no need to be artificially
suffering.

06:20.650 --> 06:23.679
There is no suffering that is allowed
in Sahaja Yoga,

06:23.880 --> 06:26.639
so if you think something is wrong...
[cut in the video].

06:26.840 --> 06:30.080
… is done, it is sinful. One should never
do like that;

06:30.280 --> 06:35.124
you are married in Sahaja Yoga not
to separate your husband from collectivity.

06:35.325 --> 06:42.353
There’s more enjoyment, more sharing
and no pressure

06:42.554 --> 06:45.707
if you all enjoy the collectivity.

06:45.908 --> 06:52.642
I know you are all very wise and good girls
and you will look after your family life

06:52.843 --> 06:57.981
and your social life and also look after
your husband.

06:58.182 --> 07:05.614
But you should also look after other people
and try to understand your problems:

07:05.815 --> 07:10.302
what problems you have, you had. And then
try to solve them

07:10.503 --> 07:15.079
so that those who come to your house
or those who are in contact with you

07:15.280 --> 07:20.320
will be specially blessed by your Gruha
Lakshmi quality.

07:20.521 --> 07:24.669
In a collective way you must meditate.
You must meditate at home

07:24.870 --> 07:31.665
and you must go to every meditation centre
whenever it is necessary.

07:31.866 --> 07:35.660
I’ve seen the women in Sahaja Yoga are
rather poor for spirituality,

07:35.860 --> 07:40.637
it’s very surprising. I am Myself a woman
and I can’t understand

07:40.838 --> 07:45.744
that they are so busy, you see, doing
all other things but not meditation.

07:45.945 --> 07:50.400
So, you have to become gems in Sahaja Yoga.
In spirituality you have to rise.

07:50.601 --> 07:52.911
For that you must meditate at home

07:53.112 --> 08:00.018
and also go to all the collective
programmes you have.

08:00.219 --> 08:03.877
This will help you a lot, help you,
your children;

08:04.078 --> 08:06.027
they will become very good children,

08:06.228 --> 08:13.979
and their whole standard of life will be
very much higher and spiritual.

08:14.180 --> 08:18.851
We have to create these great families.
That’s why I was insisting

08:19.052 --> 08:22.683
that we should have marriages here.
But by this, if we have

08:22.884 --> 08:27.391
all the other kind of useless marriages,
it’s better not to have.

08:27.592 --> 08:31.388
So, I request you to take up
the responsibility of a wife

08:31.589 --> 08:37.346
and look after the whole family, look after
the whole family of Sahaja Yogis.

08:37.547 --> 08:43.130
And apart from that, you have to think
what you can contribute to Sahaja Yoga.

08:43.331 --> 08:46.797
We have some very great women who have
done a lot,

08:46.998 --> 08:49.660
who are married women, done a lot
for Sahaja Yoga.

08:49.860 --> 08:56.628
In the same way, you should take up upon
yourself to do Sahaja Yoga work

08:56.829 --> 09:00.267
and Sahaja Yoga expansion.

09:00.468 --> 09:05.701
I hope you understand how important
you are in Sahaja Yoga.

09:05.902 --> 09:12.049
After all, this husband is more busy
outside

09:12.250 --> 09:17.506
and maybe he might little bit neglect you.
But that doesn’t mean that he neglects;

09:17.707 --> 09:21.384
you must understand that he has to work
hard and this and that.

09:21.585 --> 09:25.460
Also, there's the demand on his time,
demand on his money

09:25.660 --> 09:29.345
should be minimum, minimum that is
possible.

09:29.546 --> 09:34.088
But if [the] husband is absolutely careless
about you, and doesn’t bother about you

09:34.289 --> 09:36.992
or he dominates you or troubles you,
tortures you;

09:37.193 --> 09:42.263
in any way if you are unhappy, you are
open, absolutely open to write to Me

09:42.464 --> 09:44.185
about all that is happening,

09:44.386 --> 09:50.520
because I’ll try to correct him and I’ll
try to see what is the problem inside.

09:51.395 --> 09:56.024
The last thing one has to know [is] that
a woman has to be extremely moral.

09:56.233 --> 10:00.663
She has to be extremely moral. If she
becomes immoral,

10:00.864 --> 10:04.358
the husband will become immoral,
the children will become immoral.

10:04.559 --> 10:09.304
So, you have to stick onto your morality,
be proud of it and you can do it

10:09.505 --> 10:12.968
because God has given you a special
quality.

10:13.169 --> 10:17.801
So, it is your duty to keep great morality
in the family

10:18.002 --> 10:28.987
and to live like good citizens of your
country, citizens of Sahaja Yoga family.

10:29.188 --> 10:35.145
I bless you all with My heart again
and please accept what I’ve said.

10:35.346 --> 10:40.403
If you don’t want, even now, not to marry,
you can decide that;

10:40.604 --> 10:45.289
if possible, I will try to remove this out.

10:45.490 --> 10:48.023
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
