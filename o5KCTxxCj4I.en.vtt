WEBVTT

00:02.897 --> 00:13.282
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

00:14.872 --> 00:23.531
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

00:23.732 --> 00:32.813
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

00:33.014 --> 00:39.548
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

00:40.169 --> 00:46.509
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

00:49.245 --> 00:56.296
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

00:56.497 --> 00:59.927
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

01:00.128 --> 01:09.515
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

01:10.495 --> 01:14.835
And for that I have a plan.

01:15.036 --> 01:21.838
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

01:22.039 --> 01:27.988
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

01:28.189 --> 01:34.995
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

01:35.196 --> 01:39.952
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

01:40.153 --> 01:43.952
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

01:44.175 --> 01:52.341
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

01:52.628 --> 02:00.438
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

02:01.080 --> 02:09.977
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

02:10.178 --> 02:15.569
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

02:15.770 --> 02:19.713
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

02:19.914 --> 02:27.868
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

02:28.069 --> 02:31.683
But not only in England, same in Paris:

02:31.884 --> 02:36.895
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

02:37.096 --> 02:41.472
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

02:42.155 --> 02:46.301
This madness is on and on and on.

02:46.502 --> 02:52.982
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

02:53.183 --> 02:57.838
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

02:58.701 --> 03:03.376
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

03:03.577 --> 03:11.399
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.972
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

03:18.173 --> 03:20.673
of these useless things?

03:20.849 --> 03:24.275
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

03:24.476 --> 03:31.540
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

03:31.741 --> 03:35.950
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

03:36.150 --> 03:41.091
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

03:41.292 --> 03:48.759
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.568
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

03:51.769 --> 03:55.485
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

03:55.686 --> 04:03.659
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

04:03.860 --> 04:10.247
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

04:10.448 --> 04:16.660
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

04:18.735 --> 04:27.226
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

04:27.405 --> 04:35.368
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

04:35.569 --> 04:38.809
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

04:39.010 --> 04:43.130
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

04:43.331 --> 04:48.644
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

04:48.845 --> 04:51.581
So, it is against you.

04:51.782 --> 05:00.956
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

05:01.157 --> 05:06.750
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

05:06.951 --> 05:10.611
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

05:10.812 --> 05:21.348
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

05:21.865 --> 05:25.643
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

05:25.844 --> 05:30.584
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

05:30.785 --> 05:34.935
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

05:35.136 --> 05:42.988
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

05:44.182 --> 05:49.819
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

05:50.020 --> 05:54.730
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

05:55.008 --> 06:04.476
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

06:04.677 --> 06:08.148
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

06:08.349 --> 06:13.511
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

06:13.690 --> 06:19.514
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

06:19.714 --> 06:25.310
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

06:25.511 --> 06:30.643
Because wisdom itself shows

06:30.844 --> 06:36.908
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

06:37.473 --> 06:42.442
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

06:42.643 --> 06:46.619
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

06:46.820 --> 06:52.733
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

06:52.934 --> 07:01.967
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

07:02.168 --> 07:06.018
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

07:06.219 --> 07:10.783
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

07:10.984 --> 07:14.924
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

07:15.125 --> 07:20.713
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

07:20.914 --> 07:24.937
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

07:25.138 --> 07:30.888
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

07:31.089 --> 07:34.718
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

07:34.919 --> 07:40.306
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

07:40.507 --> 07:45.204
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

07:45.405 --> 07:51.505
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

07:51.706 --> 07:57.793
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

07:57.994 --> 08:03.530
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

08:03.731 --> 08:09.489
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

08:09.653 --> 08:17.234
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

08:17.435 --> 08:22.668
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

08:22.869 --> 08:25.454
Evening time the car used to come,

08:25.655 --> 08:32.039
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

08:32.240 --> 08:38.097
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

08:38.298 --> 08:45.390
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

08:45.591 --> 08:49.621
At the most you can see some lamppost.

08:49.822 --> 08:55.603
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

08:55.803 --> 09:02.667
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

09:03.682 --> 09:10.487
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

09:10.670 --> 09:15.749
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

09:15.950 --> 09:20.019
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

09:20.220 --> 09:26.532
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

09:27.426 --> 09:33.070
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

09:33.271 --> 09:37.737
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

09:37.938 --> 09:42.739
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

09:43.584 --> 09:48.217
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

09:48.418 --> 09:54.864
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

09:55.605 --> 10:04.165
Now see what has happened in, say,

10:04.366 --> 10:10.662
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

10:10.872 --> 10:15.654
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

10:15.855 --> 10:18.908
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

10:19.109 --> 10:23.966
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

10:24.688 --> 10:29.449
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

10:29.650 --> 10:37.924
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

10:38.125 --> 10:43.929
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

10:44.130 --> 10:48.335
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

10:48.536 --> 10:54.206
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

10:56.003 --> 10:59.975
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

11:00.152 --> 11:02.887
And it’s all working out everywhere.

11:03.088 --> 11:08.396
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

11:08.597 --> 11:15.664
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

11:17.097 --> 11:20.406
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

11:20.607 --> 11:26.295
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

11:26.456 --> 11:29.047
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

11:29.224 --> 11:33.002
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

11:33.203 --> 11:37.729
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

11:37.930 --> 11:42.630
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

11:45.978 --> 11:50.843
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

11:51.044 --> 11:53.894
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

11:54.095 --> 11:59.909
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

12:00.110 --> 12:06.518
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

12:06.719 --> 12:11.238
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

12:11.439 --> 12:18.298
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

12:18.499 --> 12:28.621
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

12:28.822 --> 12:34.333
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

12:34.534 --> 12:36.880
So many have lost their money there,

12:37.057 --> 12:39.612
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

12:39.813 --> 12:44.033
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

12:44.234 --> 12:53.078
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

12:53.975 --> 13:04.987
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

13:06.747 --> 13:12.415
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

13:12.756 --> 13:18.038
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

13:18.239 --> 13:25.301
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

13:25.507 --> 13:31.521
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

13:31.722 --> 13:36.807
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

13:37.008 --> 13:46.393
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

13:46.594 --> 13:49.544
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

13:49.745 --> 13:54.138
because I spent money on My family things
also.

13:54.339 --> 14:01.350
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

14:01.533 --> 14:05.435
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

14:05.636 --> 14:12.269
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

14:12.470 --> 14:19.588
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

14:19.789 --> 14:23.416
Joy is much more in giving to others.

14:23.617 --> 14:31.905
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

14:32.106 --> 14:37.821
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

14:38.022 --> 14:45.789
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

14:45.990 --> 14:58.437
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

14:58.638 --> 15:03.460
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

15:03.661 --> 15:07.869
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

15:08.070 --> 15:12.653
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

15:12.854 --> 15:16.759
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

15:16.960 --> 15:22.315
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

15:22.516 --> 15:24.916
At least, there should be some embroidery,

15:25.117 --> 15:29.521
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

15:29.727 --> 15:34.119
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

15:34.320 --> 15:37.080
they are injurious to our health.

15:37.281 --> 15:42.420
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

15:42.621 --> 15:47.428
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

15:47.629 --> 15:53.174
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

15:53.375 --> 15:56.558
how many of you know?

16:01.146 --> 16:09.461
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

16:09.662 --> 16:13.751
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

16:13.952 --> 16:20.831
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

16:21.032 --> 16:24.115
From where does this sari comes?

16:24.316 --> 16:30.097
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

16:30.298 --> 16:34.364
But even western men also have the same
problem.

16:34.565 --> 16:38.623
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

16:38.819 --> 16:43.100
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

16:43.301 --> 16:46.547
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

16:46.748 --> 16:50.922
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

16:51.123 --> 16:57.318
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

16:58.982 --> 17:05.067
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

17:06.960 --> 17:14.254
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

17:14.455 --> 17:20.377
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

17:20.578 --> 17:24.303
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

17:24.504 --> 17:28.234
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

17:28.435 --> 17:33.690
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

17:33.891 --> 17:41.158
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

17:41.359 --> 17:48.069
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

17:48.270 --> 17:55.137
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

17:55.338 --> 17:58.409
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

17:58.570 --> 18:02.421
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

18:02.622 --> 18:09.139
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

18:09.340 --> 18:14.367
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

18:14.568 --> 18:19.711
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

18:19.912 --> 18:26.745
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

18:26.946 --> 18:33.227
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

18:33.428 --> 18:38.735
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

18:38.936 --> 18:41.614
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

18:41.815 --> 18:45.877
this is red but it has green to match it.

18:46.078 --> 18:49.576
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

18:49.777 --> 18:54.807
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

18:55.008 --> 18:59.395
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

18:59.596 --> 19:03.382
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

19:04.826 --> 19:07.093
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

19:07.294 --> 19:10.307
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

19:10.508 --> 19:14.426
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

19:14.627 --> 19:18.737
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

19:18.938 --> 19:24.098
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

19:24.299 --> 19:27.917
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

19:28.118 --> 19:31.394
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

19:31.608 --> 19:36.958
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

19:37.159 --> 19:43.821
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

19:44.022 --> 19:50.955
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

19:51.156 --> 19:54.559
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

19:54.760 --> 19:58.176
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

19:58.377 --> 20:02.445
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

20:02.646 --> 20:06.827
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

20:07.028 --> 20:12.146
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

20:12.347 --> 20:17.570
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

20:17.771 --> 20:21.816
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

20:22.017 --> 20:25.775
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

20:25.976 --> 20:29.789
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

20:29.990 --> 20:32.768
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

20:32.969 --> 20:35.844
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

20:36.045 --> 20:42.189
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

20:42.390 --> 20:46.870
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

20:47.071 --> 20:52.988
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

20:53.189 --> 20:56.006
I sold one of My ornaments

20:56.207 --> 21:00.902
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

21:01.102 --> 21:05.411
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

21:05.612 --> 21:16.356
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

21:16.983 --> 21:22.466
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

21:22.680 --> 21:28.122
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

21:29.410 --> 21:37.545
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

21:39.852 --> 21:43.066
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
but I am missing him

21:43.267 --> 21:48.571
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

21:48.772 --> 21:51.251
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

21:51.452 --> 21:57.075
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

21:57.276 --> 22:03.253
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

22:03.454 --> 22:07.965
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

22:08.166 --> 22:14.417
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

22:16.818 --> 22:20.490
These small, small things can give you
great joy

22:20.691 --> 22:26.571
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

22:26.772 --> 22:31.354
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

22:31.555 --> 22:33.836
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

22:34.037 --> 22:38.154
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

22:38.355 --> 22:42.497
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

22:42.698 --> 22:45.972
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

22:46.173 --> 22:53.356
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

22:53.557 --> 22:57.286
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

22:57.487 --> 23:00.190
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

23:00.391 --> 23:05.062
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

23:05.263 --> 23:09.992
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

23:10.193 --> 23:15.545
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

23:15.746 --> 23:19.907
I don’t even have time to see them.

23:20.814 --> 23:27.463
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

23:27.685 --> 23:31.390
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

23:31.591 --> 23:35.572
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

23:35.781 --> 23:40.158
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

23:40.359 --> 23:46.460
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

23:46.661 --> 23:51.334
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

23:51.535 --> 23:58.733
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

23:59.624 --> 24:03.381
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

24:03.582 --> 24:11.525
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

24:11.915 --> 24:17.428
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

24:17.629 --> 24:25.293
being absolutely beyond any problem.

24:25.596 --> 24:31.179
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

24:31.380 --> 24:37.186
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

24:37.387 --> 24:41.094
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

24:41.295 --> 24:46.016
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

24:46.217 --> 24:52.472
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

24:53.590 --> 24:58.417
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

24:58.618 --> 25:02.820
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

25:03.021 --> 25:06.159
Only the designers they make the money.

25:06.359 --> 25:11.223
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

25:12.774 --> 25:20.646
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

25:21.894 --> 25:24.500
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

25:24.701 --> 25:29.794
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

25:29.995 --> 25:35.225
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

25:36.305 --> 25:43.321
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

25:44.768 --> 25:48.779
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

25:48.980 --> 25:52.971
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

25:53.172 --> 25:58.162
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

25:58.370 --> 26:02.132
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

26:02.333 --> 26:08.557
So, I went to one shop in America

26:08.758 --> 26:11.742
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

26:11.943 --> 26:16.520
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

26:16.721 --> 26:23.257
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

26:23.458 --> 26:27.971
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

26:30.133 --> 26:38.128
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

26:38.329 --> 26:46.837
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

26:47.038 --> 26:51.695
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

26:51.896 --> 26:56.525
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

26:57.160 --> 27:01.580
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

27:02.166 --> 27:05.312
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

27:05.513 --> 27:09.278
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

27:09.564 --> 27:13.559
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.705
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

27:18.372 --> 27:22.534
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

27:22.735 --> 27:26.255
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

27:26.456 --> 27:30.821
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

27:31.022 --> 27:37.185
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

27:37.386 --> 27:42.056
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

27:42.257 --> 27:47.329
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

27:47.530 --> 27:52.017
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

27:52.218 --> 27:54.938
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

27:55.147 --> 28:03.801
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

28:06.234 --> 28:12.032
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

28:12.256 --> 28:15.490
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

28:15.691 --> 28:19.636
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

28:19.837 --> 28:24.250
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

28:24.451 --> 28:31.289
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

28:31.490 --> 28:37.719
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

28:38.485 --> 28:43.890
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

28:44.091 --> 28:53.645
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

28:53.846 --> 28:58.411
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

28:58.612 --> 29:03.325
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

29:03.526 --> 29:07.497
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

29:07.711 --> 29:10.454
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

29:10.622 --> 29:13.743
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

29:13.944 --> 29:17.724
if they can get the same dinner set.

29:17.925 --> 29:22.347
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

29:22.548 --> 29:32.109
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

29:32.310 --> 29:36.161
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

29:36.362 --> 29:40.397
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

29:40.598 --> 29:44.383
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

29:44.584 --> 29:51.979
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

29:52.267 --> 29:54.968
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

29:55.198 --> 29:58.001
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

29:58.202 --> 30:05.165
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

30:05.366 --> 30:11.287
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

30:12.009 --> 30:17.555
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

30:18.172 --> 30:24.276
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

30:26.603 --> 30:29.964
Just there you get it.

30:30.918 --> 30:36.398
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

30:36.608 --> 30:41.080
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

30:41.281 --> 30:44.797
if you don’t have greed about it.

30:45.004 --> 30:50.786
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

30:50.987 --> 30:57.492
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

30:57.693 --> 31:03.650
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

31:03.851 --> 31:09.944
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

31:10.603 --> 31:17.858
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

31:18.230 --> 31:21.699
And then the thing also gets lost.

31:21.900 --> 31:29.147
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

31:29.485 --> 31:34.510
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

31:35.763 --> 31:39.474
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

31:39.675 --> 31:45.647
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

31:45.848 --> 31:51.447
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

31:51.648 --> 31:56.747
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

31:59.228 --> 32:08.594
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

32:14.656 --> 32:20.319
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

32:21.784 --> 32:27.636
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

32:27.837 --> 32:32.457
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

32:32.658 --> 32:39.460
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

32:41.102 --> 32:46.427
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

32:47.311 --> 32:49.900
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

32:50.101 --> 32:53.999
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

32:57.305 --> 33:01.800
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

33:07.980 --> 33:11.326
They are mostly from Russia.

33:13.038 --> 33:21.779
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

33:21.980 --> 33:27.024
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

33:27.225 --> 33:32.648
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

33:32.849 --> 33:36.732
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

33:36.933 --> 33:42.081
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

33:42.659 --> 33:46.787
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

33:46.988 --> 33:52.303
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

33:52.504 --> 33:56.438
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

33:56.639 --> 34:00.876
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

34:01.084 --> 34:06.319
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

34:07.495 --> 34:13.647
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

34:13.848 --> 34:18.881
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

34:19.082 --> 34:21.978
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

34:22.179 --> 34:25.828
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

34:26.029 --> 34:31.338
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

34:31.539 --> 34:37.149
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

34:37.350 --> 34:44.155
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

34:44.356 --> 34:50.360
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

34:51.154 --> 34:55.747
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

34:55.948 --> 35:01.761
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

35:02.653 --> 35:07.013
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

35:07.214 --> 35:11.184
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

35:11.385 --> 35:17.038
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

35:18.775 --> 35:28.614
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

35:28.815 --> 35:33.700
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

35:33.901 --> 35:40.999
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

35:42.330 --> 35:47.657
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

35:47.858 --> 35:53.888
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

35:54.530 --> 35:59.580
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

35:59.781 --> 36:05.786
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

36:05.987 --> 36:11.123
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

36:11.324 --> 36:16.012
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

36:16.213 --> 36:20.650
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

36:20.851 --> 36:26.631
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

36:26.832 --> 36:32.245
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

36:32.446 --> 36:39.483
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

36:40.273 --> 36:47.974
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

36:52.792 --> 37:00.347
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

37:00.548 --> 37:04.882
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

37:05.827 --> 37:10.966
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

37:11.167 --> 37:14.415
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

37:14.616 --> 37:17.795
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

37:17.996 --> 37:24.100
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

37:24.301 --> 37:27.421
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

37:27.622 --> 37:31.254
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

37:31.455 --> 37:35.201
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

37:35.402 --> 37:43.450
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

37:43.651 --> 37:48.058
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

37:48.259 --> 37:55.720
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

37:55.921 --> 38:00.877
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

38:01.078 --> 38:03.764
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

38:03.978 --> 38:07.910
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

38:08.111 --> 38:11.918
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

38:12.119 --> 38:14.584
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

38:14.785 --> 38:21.269
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

38:21.470 --> 38:28.603
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

38:28.804 --> 38:35.806
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

38:36.007 --> 38:39.432
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

38:39.633 --> 38:44.423
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

38:44.585 --> 38:48.673
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

38:48.874 --> 38:54.702
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

38:54.903 --> 39:00.358
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

39:00.583 --> 39:04.287
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

39:04.488 --> 39:10.622
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

39:10.823 --> 39:15.878
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

39:16.079 --> 39:20.368
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

39:20.569 --> 39:24.813
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

39:25.014 --> 39:32.472
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

39:32.673 --> 39:36.443
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

39:36.644 --> 39:41.357
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

39:41.558 --> 39:44.301
that we have got the Spirit within us.

39:44.502 --> 39:50.032
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

39:50.233 --> 39:53.723
You are people who are all realized souls.

39:53.924 --> 39:58.793
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

39:58.994 --> 40:03.365
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

40:03.566 --> 40:11.182
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

40:11.383 --> 40:15.289
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

40:15.489 --> 40:22.480
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

40:22.681 --> 40:27.344
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

40:27.545 --> 40:32.628
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

40:32.829 --> 40:36.033
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

40:36.234 --> 40:43.271
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

40:44.277 --> 40:47.882
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

40:48.083 --> 40:50.123
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

40:50.324 --> 40:54.814
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

40:55.015 --> 41:01.162
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

41:01.363 --> 41:08.372
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

41:08.705 --> 41:14.884
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

41:15.085 --> 41:20.080
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

41:20.281 --> 41:26.413
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

41:26.614 --> 41:31.043
it is absolutely a hell for man.

41:32.369 --> 41:38.290
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

41:38.491 --> 41:44.480
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

41:44.681 --> 41:49.552
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

41:49.697 --> 41:53.038
What pleases the husband?

41:54.550 --> 41:57.937
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

41:58.138 --> 42:03.832
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

42:04.033 --> 42:08.896
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

42:09.097 --> 42:12.757
First of all find out what he likes.

42:14.485 --> 42:17.452
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

42:17.653 --> 42:20.518
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

42:20.719 --> 42:25.261
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

42:25.462 --> 42:30.957
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

42:31.158 --> 42:36.829
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

42:37.030 --> 42:40.385
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

42:40.586 --> 42:44.014
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

42:44.215 --> 42:51.097
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

42:51.298 --> 42:54.787
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

42:54.964 --> 42:59.075
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

42:59.276 --> 43:03.850
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

43:04.051 --> 43:07.483
because women are responsible
for the society.

43:07.684 --> 43:13.962
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

43:14.163 --> 43:18.778
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

43:18.979 --> 43:24.454
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

43:24.655 --> 43:29.074
But your job is to make the society.

43:29.275 --> 43:33.834
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

43:34.035 --> 43:38.418
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

43:38.619 --> 43:44.051
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

43:44.252 --> 43:46.855
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

43:47.056 --> 43:55.915
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

43:56.772 --> 44:02.468
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

44:04.178 --> 44:10.577
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

44:10.778 --> 44:16.365
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

44:16.566 --> 44:19.541
But there was one gentleman, good one,

44:19.742 --> 44:23.712
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

44:23.913 --> 44:27.763
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

44:27.964 --> 44:34.859
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

44:35.633 --> 44:38.596
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

44:38.797 --> 44:41.621
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

44:41.822 --> 44:48.649
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

44:48.850 --> 44:53.047
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

44:53.248 --> 44:58.621
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

44:58.822 --> 45:03.328
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

45:03.529 --> 45:08.127
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

45:08.328 --> 45:13.081
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

45:13.282 --> 45:17.207
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

45:17.408 --> 45:21.273
Immediately this competition.

45:26.708 --> 45:29.809
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

45:30.010 --> 45:32.975
even in London he was helping him a lot.

45:33.176 --> 45:39.127
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

45:39.328 --> 45:43.829
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

45:45.636 --> 45:49.532
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

45:49.733 --> 45:53.213
Otherwise for small, small things,

45:53.414 --> 45:57.997
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

45:58.198 --> 46:04.630
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

46:06.075 --> 46:10.852
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

46:11.053 --> 46:15.794
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

46:15.995 --> 46:21.535
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

46:21.736 --> 46:27.371
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

46:27.572 --> 46:29.943
[Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

46:30.144 --> 46:34.719
she was married to somebody in USA.

46:34.920 --> 46:42.274
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

46:42.475 --> 46:45.952
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

46:46.153 --> 46:53.218
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

46:53.419 --> 46:59.750
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

46:59.951 --> 47:05.390
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

47:05.591 --> 47:10.976
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

47:11.177 --> 47:14.888
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

47:15.089 --> 47:20.163
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

47:20.364 --> 47:23.930
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

47:24.114 --> 47:30.648
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

47:30.849 --> 47:34.788
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

47:35.721 --> 47:45.354
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

47:45.555 --> 47:48.483
Why has he married?

47:48.684 --> 47:55.669
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

47:59.268 --> 48:01.660
It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

48:01.861 --> 48:06.829
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

48:07.030 --> 48:10.280
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

48:10.481 --> 48:15.392
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

48:15.593 --> 48:19.884
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

48:20.366 --> 48:25.910
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

48:26.077 --> 48:31.148
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

48:31.349 --> 48:34.493
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

48:34.694 --> 48:38.627
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

48:38.828 --> 48:45.214
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

48:45.415 --> 48:50.838
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

48:51.039 --> 48:55.334
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

48:56.495 --> 49:01.843
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

49:02.020 --> 49:06.003
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

49:06.204 --> 49:13.537
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

49:15.676 --> 49:19.666
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

49:19.867 --> 49:22.539
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

49:22.740 --> 49:25.557
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

49:25.758 --> 49:31.094
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

49:33.273 --> 49:39.262
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

49:39.463 --> 49:44.323
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

49:48.534 --> 49:51.672
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

49:51.873 --> 49:55.620
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

49:55.821 --> 50:00.117
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

50:00.318 --> 50:05.551
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

50:07.189 --> 50:10.582
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

50:10.783 --> 50:14.264
try to understand why she does it.

50:14.465 --> 50:19.269
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

50:19.470 --> 50:25.057
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

50:25.258 --> 50:30.170
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

50:30.371 --> 50:35.851
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

50:36.052 --> 50:42.031
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

50:42.232 --> 50:46.484
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

50:46.685 --> 50:50.643
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

50:50.844 --> 50:55.298
and he is not there and this and that.”

50:55.614 --> 50:58.955
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

50:59.156 --> 51:04.561
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

51:04.762 --> 51:08.790
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

51:08.991 --> 51:11.781
I can’t understand the logic.

51:11.982 --> 51:16.479
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

51:16.680 --> 51:22.191
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

51:22.857 --> 51:31.461
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

51:31.662 --> 51:37.811
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

51:39.418 --> 51:42.004
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

51:42.205 --> 51:47.020
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

51:47.221 --> 51:52.569
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

51:52.770 --> 51:57.314
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

51:57.515 --> 52:02.779
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

52:02.980 --> 52:07.143
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

52:07.344 --> 52:10.599
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

52:11.250 --> 52:17.253
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

52:17.454 --> 52:21.084
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

52:21.285 --> 52:26.354
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

52:26.539 --> 52:30.323
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

52:30.524 --> 52:33.131
So, with such an ignorance of things,

52:33.332 --> 52:38.247
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

52:39.767 --> 52:47.104
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

52:47.305 --> 52:51.885
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

52:52.093 --> 53:00.321
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

53:00.584 --> 53:03.433
He buys always very expensive things.

53:03.634 --> 53:07.869
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

53:08.070 --> 53:13.121
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

53:13.322 --> 53:18.704
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

53:18.905 --> 53:23.847
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

53:24.048 --> 53:29.152
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

53:29.353 --> 53:35.116
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

53:35.317 --> 53:39.467
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

53:39.644 --> 53:43.286
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

53:43.487 --> 53:47.209
but he likes to give that only – all right.

53:47.410 --> 53:52.065
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

53:52.266 --> 53:56.219
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

53:56.420 --> 54:02.040
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

54:02.241 --> 54:07.073
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

54:07.274 --> 54:13.941
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

54:14.142 --> 54:20.679
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

54:20.880 --> 54:23.813
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

54:24.014 --> 54:28.683
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

54:28.884 --> 54:32.458
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

54:32.659 --> 54:36.568
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

54:36.769 --> 54:39.820
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

54:40.021 --> 54:43.392
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

54:43.593 --> 54:49.374
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

54:49.575 --> 54:54.746
[Hindi aside]

54:54.956 --> 54:58.186
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

54:58.400 --> 55:02.322
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

55:02.523 --> 55:06.414
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

55:06.615 --> 55:10.936
I was walking like a giant, you know.

55:17.165 --> 55:21.488
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

55:21.689 --> 55:25.724
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

55:25.925 --> 55:29.001
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

55:29.202 --> 55:33.433
I sat in one place glued down into that.

55:33.634 --> 55:38.893
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

55:39.094 --> 55:44.605
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

55:44.806 --> 55:48.193
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

55:48.394 --> 55:52.327
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

55:52.528 --> 55:58.423
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

55:59.177 --> 56:01.701
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

56:01.866 --> 56:06.747
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

56:06.948 --> 56:09.631
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

56:09.832 --> 56:16.160
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

56:16.384 --> 56:22.913
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

56:23.114 --> 56:27.987
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

56:28.188 --> 56:31.427
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

56:31.628 --> 56:34.725
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

56:34.925 --> 56:40.417
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

56:40.618 --> 56:43.563
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

56:43.764 --> 56:47.251
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

56:47.452 --> 56:52.408
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

56:55.404 --> 56:57.596
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

56:57.797 --> 57:00.541
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

57:00.742 --> 57:05.857
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

57:06.058 --> 57:08.757
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

57:08.958 --> 57:14.909
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

57:15.110 --> 57:19.795
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

57:19.996 --> 57:25.633
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

57:25.819 --> 57:27.431
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

57:27.632 --> 57:30.721
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

57:30.922 --> 57:34.692
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

57:34.893 --> 57:39.099
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

57:39.300 --> 57:43.877
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

57:44.078 --> 57:49.008
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

57:51.162 --> 57:55.437
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

57:55.622 --> 58:01.570
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

58:01.771 --> 58:05.706
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

58:05.907 --> 58:11.894
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

58:12.095 --> 58:14.480
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

58:14.681 --> 58:19.361
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

58:19.536 --> 58:23.726
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

58:23.926 --> 58:26.831
You are not going to beat (them).

58:27.909 --> 58:33.148
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

58:33.349 --> 58:36.276
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

58:36.477 --> 58:40.250
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

58:40.451 --> 58:44.260
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

58:44.461 --> 58:48.119
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

58:48.320 --> 58:53.043
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

58:53.244 --> 59:00.261
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

59:00.462 --> 59:04.936
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

59:05.144 --> 59:13.386
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

59:13.587 --> 59:18.967
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

59:19.168 --> 59:25.590
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

59:25.797 --> 59:29.280
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

59:29.481 --> 59:32.047
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

59:32.248 --> 59:37.321
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

59:37.522 --> 59:40.065
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

59:40.266 --> 59:45.470
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

59:45.671 --> 59:52.281
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

59:52.482 --> 59:55.303
In India no woman will do that.

59:55.504 --> 59:59.863
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

01:00:05.513 --> 01:00:11.491
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:14.924
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:19.314
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:22.413
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

01:00:22.614 --> 01:00:28.899
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.491
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

01:00:32.692 --> 01:00:35.512
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:39.573
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

01:00:39.774 --> 01:00:43.584
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

01:00:43.785 --> 01:00:50.930
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

01:00:51.131 --> 01:00:55.184
But this Western women never understand.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:01:01.399
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

01:01:01.599 --> 01:01:07.050
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:10.762
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

01:01:10.963 --> 01:01:15.074
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

01:01:15.275 --> 01:01:19.929
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:25.330
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

01:01:25.531 --> 01:01:33.911
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

01:01:34.112 --> 01:01:41.545
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

01:01:41.746 --> 01:01:44.959
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.967
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

01:01:51.168 --> 01:01:53.821
This is very Western, I must say.

01:01:54.022 --> 01:02:00.861
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

01:02:01.139 --> 01:02:06.758
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

01:02:06.959 --> 01:02:10.730
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

01:02:10.931 --> 01:02:15.010
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:18.743
This is not the way a woman should look.

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:23.654
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

01:02:23.855 --> 01:02:30.081
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

01:02:30.282 --> 01:02:37.795
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

01:02:37.996 --> 01:02:42.625
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:46.946
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

01:02:47.147 --> 01:02:50.191
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

01:02:50.392 --> 01:03:00.595
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

01:03:00.796 --> 01:03:08.401
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

01:03:12.804 --> 01:03:18.007
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

01:03:18.192 --> 01:03:20.619
Who are you to like or not like?

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:25.757
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

01:03:25.958 --> 01:03:32.148
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

01:03:32.357 --> 01:03:40.152
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

01:03:40.353 --> 01:03:44.938
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

01:03:45.139 --> 01:03:49.648
and should have very, very large hearts.

01:03:53.248 --> 01:04:01.859
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.264
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

01:04:05.465 --> 01:04:11.279
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

01:04:13.796 --> 01:04:18.977
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

01:04:19.178 --> 01:04:26.191
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

01:04:26.392 --> 01:04:31.248
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

01:04:31.449 --> 01:04:34.555
very, very good reports about them.

01:04:34.756 --> 01:04:39.659
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.019
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:49.191
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

01:04:49.392 --> 01:04:56.990
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

01:04:57.191 --> 01:05:00.042
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

01:05:00.243 --> 01:05:03.808
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

01:05:04.376 --> 01:05:07.091
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

01:05:07.292 --> 01:05:10.978
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

01:05:11.179 --> 01:05:15.970
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

01:05:16.171 --> 01:05:19.918
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

01:05:20.119 --> 01:05:24.388
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:27.819
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:32.420
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

01:05:32.652 --> 01:05:38.933
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:42.247
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

01:05:42.448 --> 01:05:47.953
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

01:05:48.154 --> 01:05:50.674
thanks to Swiss influence.

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:55.849
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

01:05:56.056 --> 01:06:01.533
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

01:06:01.734 --> 01:06:06.316
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

01:06:11.554 --> 01:06:15.569
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:21.095
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

01:06:21.296 --> 01:06:28.197
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

01:06:29.513 --> 01:06:32.675
This is the book. You all should buy it.

01:06:32.876 --> 01:06:36.290
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

01:06:36.491 --> 01:06:39.809
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

01:07:02.229 --> 01:07:05.495
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

01:07:05.696 --> 01:07:09.276
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

01:07:09.477 --> 01:07:14.326
So, you will understand about Indian music.

01:07:14.527 --> 01:07:20.725
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

01:07:21.159 --> 01:07:28.040
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:34.492
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

01:07:34.693 --> 01:07:39.429
who were singing western song, was alright.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:44.764
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

01:07:44.965 --> 01:07:48.207
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

01:07:48.408 --> 01:07:52.005
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

01:07:52.206 --> 01:07:56.274
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

01:07:56.475 --> 01:07:59.922
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

01:08:00.123 --> 01:08:04.363
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

01:08:04.564 --> 01:08:08.673
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:14.371
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

01:08:14.572 --> 01:08:22.434
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

01:08:22.635 --> 01:08:26.271
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

01:08:26.472 --> 01:08:32.871
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

01:08:33.072 --> 01:08:37.241
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

01:08:37.442 --> 01:08:40.000
They are having all this horrible music
there.

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:45.621
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:50.007
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

01:08:50.188 --> 01:08:57.330
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

01:08:57.498 --> 01:09:01.837
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

01:09:02.038 --> 01:09:05.937
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:08.768
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:13.926
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

01:09:14.126 --> 01:09:18.907
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

01:09:19.132 --> 01:09:22.567
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

01:09:22.768 --> 01:09:27.262
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:37.139
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:43.784
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

01:09:43.985 --> 01:09:54.813
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

01:09:55.014 --> 01:09:59.560
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

01:09:59.761 --> 01:10:05.747
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

01:10:05.947 --> 01:10:07.888
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

01:10:08.089 --> 01:10:11.998
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

01:10:12.199 --> 01:10:16.372
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

01:10:16.573 --> 01:10:20.017
you will see how different it will be.

01:10:22.154 --> 01:10:25.738
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

01:10:25.939 --> 01:10:28.583
which you should have, and which you should
understand

01:10:28.784 --> 01:10:38.019
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:44.517
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

01:10:44.718 --> 01:10:49.955
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

01:10:50.116 --> 01:10:56.159
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

01:10:57.608 --> 01:11:01.237
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

01:11:01.438 --> 01:11:05.420
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

01:11:05.621 --> 01:11:11.015
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

01:11:11.216 --> 01:11:13.964
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

01:11:14.165 --> 01:11:17.857
Then you can expand it as you like.

01:11:18.058 --> 01:11:24.182
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

01:11:24.383 --> 01:11:28.647
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

01:11:28.848 --> 01:11:35.126
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

01:11:35.414 --> 01:11:41.978
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.849
Accha.

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:49.817
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

01:11:50.018 --> 01:11:56.391
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

01:11:56.592 --> 01:12:06.313
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:14.876
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

01:12:18.914 --> 01:12:23.817
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

01:12:24.018 --> 01:12:31.107
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

01:12:31.308 --> 01:12:39.557
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

01:12:39.758 --> 01:12:46.494
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:55.015
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

01:12:55.216 --> 01:13:03.282
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

01:13:03.483 --> 01:13:08.390
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

01:13:08.565 --> 01:13:12.681
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

01:13:12.882 --> 01:13:19.506
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

01:13:19.707 --> 01:13:25.063
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

01:13:25.436 --> 01:13:32.235
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

01:13:32.436 --> 01:13:40.012
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

01:13:40.213 --> 01:13:46.718
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

01:13:46.919 --> 01:13:52.708
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

01:13:52.909 --> 01:13:56.215
Because when you try to do something wrong

01:13:56.416 --> 01:14:00.512
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

01:14:03.194 --> 01:14:07.481
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

01:14:07.682 --> 01:14:13.566
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

01:14:13.767 --> 01:14:19.631
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

01:14:19.832 --> 01:14:23.488
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:28.550
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:32.935
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:38.074
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

01:14:38.275 --> 01:14:41.715
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

01:14:41.916 --> 01:14:45.403
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

01:14:45.604 --> 01:14:51.169
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

01:14:52.943 --> 01:14:59.017
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:03.562
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

01:15:03.762 --> 01:15:07.469
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:12.753
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

01:15:12.954 --> 01:15:17.537
than father, mother, even Mataji.

01:15:18.838 --> 01:15:23.767
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

01:15:24.707 --> 01:15:26.980
So, thank you very much.
