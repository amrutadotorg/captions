01:25:32.158 --> 01:25:38.219
I bow to all those who have found the truth

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:44.425
and those who are still trying to find.

01:25:47.282 --> 01:25:51.895
The greatest problem of human beings is,

01:25:52.324 --> 01:25:56.545
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

01:25:57.049 --> 01:25:59.973
They don’t know what powers they have.

01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:03.659
They don’t know what properties they have.

01:26:03.833 --> 01:26:07.085
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

01:26:07.759 --> 01:26:13.057
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

01:26:13.748 --> 01:26:17.828
If you could just peep in your heart

01:26:17.979 --> 01:26:22.994
and start thinking about the spiritual life

01:26:23.148 --> 01:26:28.952
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

01:26:29.159 --> 01:26:33.865
treasure of powers of love,

01:26:34.115 --> 01:26:40.015
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

01:26:40.563 --> 01:26:47.493
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

01:26:48.478 --> 01:26:52.054
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

01:26:52.205 --> 01:26:56.082
that they do not realize what powers they have,

01:26:56.201 --> 01:27:01.190
and sometimes I find they are little shy
to talk about Sahaja Yoga

01:27:01.423 --> 01:27:07.741
or to tell about others because they think
it might be their ego that is bigger.

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:15.191
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:20.540
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

01:27:21.612 --> 01:27:23.866
Unless and until you face others

01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:27.702
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

01:27:27.972 --> 01:27:35.442
The ego is there because when you think
that others are better than you,

01:27:36.157 --> 01:27:41.575
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

01:27:42.241 --> 01:27:48.806
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

01:27:49.429 --> 01:27:55.566
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

01:27:55.726 --> 01:27:58.411
you are cleansing yourself.

01:27:58.953 --> 01:28:06.364
You have a power within yourself
which will show its results.

01:28:06.498 --> 01:28:12.935
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:21.107
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

01:28:22.138 --> 01:28:25.509
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

01:28:25.732 --> 01:28:31.587
that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:35.403
they all drop out.

01:28:35.856 --> 01:28:38.723
But we must face ourselves.

01:28:39.546 --> 01:28:42.417
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:46.708
that we can become a very great people

01:28:46.757 --> 01:28:50.473
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

01:28:50.703 --> 01:28:53.757
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

01:28:54.066 --> 01:28:56.651
It’s not the outside ambition,

01:28:56.802 --> 01:29:02.309
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

01:29:03.052 --> 01:29:07.075
All of you are quite intelligent

01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:11.067
and are experts, I should say,

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:14.795
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

01:29:15.024 --> 01:29:18.474
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:21.612
Do you know about yourself

01:29:21.945 --> 01:29:25.620
what you can do, what you are capable of?

01:29:25.882 --> 01:29:28.955
That’s the point where we are missing.

01:29:29.042 --> 01:29:31.924
All right, it is the urge within

01:29:32.044 --> 01:29:35.250
because you have got your self-realization.

01:29:35.668 --> 01:29:42.643
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

01:29:42.929 --> 01:29:45.490
that you know the truth.

01:29:46.245 --> 01:29:51.472
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

01:29:51.598 --> 01:29:55.356
is to spread the truth to make

01:29:55.388 --> 01:30:01.439
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

01:30:01.638 --> 01:30:05.246
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

01:30:05.436 --> 01:30:10.574
they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

01:30:10.574 --> 01:30:13.156
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

01:30:13.907 --> 01:30:19.484
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

01:30:19.619 --> 01:30:24.280
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:27.962
by giving realizations to others,

01:30:28.121 --> 01:30:31.875
by making them understand what are

01:30:32.053 --> 01:30:36.312
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

01:30:36.844 --> 01:30:38.517
What they can achieve.

01:30:38.727 --> 01:30:43.752
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

01:30:44.389 --> 01:30:48.514
But this fear that we may develop ego,

01:30:48.665 --> 01:30:52.314
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

01:30:52.593 --> 01:30:54.691
You cannot.

01:30:54.915 --> 01:30:59.572
Because the more you will meditate,
the more you will face yourself,

01:30:59.783 --> 01:31:05.716
you will know that you have so many great things within you

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:11.826
just like a storehouse of jewels.

01:31:12.662 --> 01:31:15.582
You must respect yourself

01:31:15.868 --> 01:31:20.035
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

01:31:20.147 --> 01:31:23.072
Not what you want to achieve outside.

01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:27.918
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

01:31:28.051 --> 01:31:32.731
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:38.487
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

01:31:38.845 --> 01:31:42.019
of great value system within you

01:31:42.193 --> 01:31:45.402
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

01:31:45.532 --> 01:31:49.918
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

01:31:50.084 --> 01:31:54.848
without troubling anybody,
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:59.576
But as it is I find,

01:31:59.926 --> 01:32:03.022
the people are either money oriented

01:32:03.157 --> 01:32:07.085
or power oriented outside.

01:32:08.012 --> 01:32:09.121
Not inside.

01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:13.747
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:18.200
inside everything that you can think of.

01:32:18.594 --> 01:32:23.515
There are people I know who never used to
come on the stage to speak even.

01:32:24.301 --> 01:32:27.171
Now, they have become great speakers.

01:32:27.377 --> 01:32:31.827
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

01:32:32.028 --> 01:32:37.716
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

01:32:37.835 --> 01:32:41.481
and that with that knowledge you change others.

01:32:41.662 --> 01:32:45.063
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

01:32:45.211 --> 01:32:47.890
You have to spread out.

01:32:48.009 --> 01:32:50.603
This power has been given to you

01:32:50.784 --> 01:32:54.452
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

01:32:54.747 --> 01:32:57.205
and to be kind and gentle

01:32:57.412 --> 01:33:00.723
and talk to people in that way that they know

01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:04.056
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:11.727
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

01:33:11.838 --> 01:33:14.703
but to know yourself fully,

01:33:14.805 --> 01:33:20.051
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:24.889
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
millions and millions.

01:33:25.126 --> 01:33:28.077
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:31.165
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

01:33:31.456 --> 01:33:35.665
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

01:33:35.808 --> 01:33:38.673
that “there must be something in me

01:33:38.924 --> 01:33:41.703
that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:44.378
and to understand the subtle system."

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:46.375
It’s a very subtle system

01:33:46.568 --> 01:33:50.169
and it can be known only to very subtle people

01:33:50.272 --> 01:33:52.540
and not to gross people.

01:33:52.829 --> 01:33:58.467
But if you yourself discover yourself

01:33:58.697 --> 01:34:02.911
and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

01:34:03.082 --> 01:34:04.965
because you are not ego.

01:34:05.503 --> 01:34:08.057
Those who have ego, as I told you,

01:34:08.194 --> 01:34:11.710
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:17.882
to organize things something to promote them.

01:34:18.263 --> 01:34:20.776
They are on a very different level.

01:34:20.991 --> 01:34:25.921
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

01:34:26.024 --> 01:34:29.704
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

01:34:30.497 --> 01:34:31.911
What am I?

01:34:32.184 --> 01:34:34.416
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

01:34:34.567 --> 01:34:37.165
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

01:34:37.274 --> 01:34:40.574
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:43.635
That means you are something great.

01:34:43.738 --> 01:34:48.979
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

01:34:49.164 --> 01:34:52.857
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

01:34:52.984 --> 01:34:56.906
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

01:34:56.985 --> 01:34:59.632
But you will be an ocean of love.

01:35:00.474 --> 01:35:02.216
That’s what it has to be.

01:35:02.311 --> 01:35:04.242
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

01:35:04.335 --> 01:35:07.657
I understand that these are the worst days,

01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:11.058
it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

01:35:11.233 --> 01:35:15.380
But why are you here during this time?

01:35:15.863 --> 01:35:18.279
To enlighten people.

01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:21.046
To give them the right ideas.

01:35:21.193 --> 01:35:25.096
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

01:35:25.231 --> 01:35:28.451
that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

01:35:28.677 --> 01:35:34.257
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

01:35:35.058 --> 01:35:41.027
He realized in very young age that he has to

01:35:41.726 --> 01:35:45.665
assert on others his own value system

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.620
by showing his own example.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:54.424
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

01:35:54.617 --> 01:35:58.935
still he has shown such results.

01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:02.051
I have read many lives of this kind.

01:36:02.328 --> 01:36:05.037
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

01:36:05.162 --> 01:36:07.542
We had everywhere one person like that.

01:36:07.756 --> 01:36:10.671
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

01:36:10.815 --> 01:36:15.198
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

01:36:15.333 --> 01:36:17.564
who used to respect Me so much.

01:36:17.677 --> 01:36:20.349
People would wonder why should he respect Me

01:36:20.484 --> 01:36:23.198
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:26.247
because he realized what I was.

01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:29.810
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

01:36:29.969 --> 01:36:31.867
Now, you people have a chance.

01:36:32.052 --> 01:36:35.012
All right, I am quite old now.

01:36:35.193 --> 01:36:38.605
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

01:36:38.922 --> 01:36:42.096
Till I live I’ll work very hard

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:45.826
to convince you about your own,

01:36:46.659 --> 01:36:51.364
your own personality, your own self.

01:36:51.515 --> 01:36:54.095
That’s what I am living for.

01:36:54.265 --> 01:36:57.163
Till you are completely convinced.

01:36:57.294 --> 01:37:00.898
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

01:37:00.978 --> 01:37:04.805
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

01:37:05.135 --> 01:37:07.340
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

01:37:07.443 --> 01:37:10.908
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

01:37:11.281 --> 01:37:16.720
unless and until you find out what is your personality

01:37:16.974 --> 01:37:19.252
in the real sense of the word,

01:37:19.602 --> 01:37:26.364
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

01:37:26.832 --> 01:37:28.934
Sahaja means spontaneous.

01:37:29.016 --> 01:37:31.582
It comes spontaneously to you.

01:37:31.883 --> 01:37:36.159
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

01:37:36.286 --> 01:37:40.309
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

01:37:40.579 --> 01:37:44.919
But that torsion area is there behind you,

01:37:44.998 --> 01:37:48.483
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

01:37:48.593 --> 01:37:51.897
All of you have got this, but despite that

01:37:52.024 --> 01:37:56.350
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

01:37:56.532 --> 01:37:59.528
You have that power within you.

01:37:59.816 --> 01:38:03.197
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

01:38:03.439 --> 01:38:07.188
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:09.515
I should we have lost him.

01:38:10.111 --> 01:38:15.118
So, one day he was going to another island

01:38:15.547 --> 01:38:19.824
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

01:38:20.376 --> 01:38:27.151
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

01:38:27.955 --> 01:38:30.595
So he came out and he threatened them,

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:34.240
“I am going for my Mother’s work.

01:38:34.474 --> 01:38:38.180
How dare you bring the rain?

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:42.487
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

01:38:42.861 --> 01:38:44.710
And, it was surprising.

01:38:44.847 --> 01:38:49.905
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
came back after five hours.

01:38:50.056 --> 01:38:53.386
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

01:38:53.696 --> 01:38:59.411
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.167
It helps us.

01:39:01.347 --> 01:39:05.647
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

01:39:05.829 --> 01:39:09.930
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

01:39:10.263 --> 01:39:14.498
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

01:39:14.622 --> 01:39:21.614
but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

01:39:21.857 --> 01:39:24.664
And that I am to be supported.

01:39:24.973 --> 01:39:29.680
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

01:39:29.878 --> 01:39:34.304
that you are the people who are here to

01:39:34.534 --> 01:39:38.935
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

01:39:38.962 --> 01:39:43.208
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

01:39:43.311 --> 01:39:44.595
But, how can I do it?

01:39:44.595 --> 01:39:47.194
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

01:39:47.289 --> 01:39:48.821
I have to have channels.

01:39:48.924 --> 01:39:52.064
And, these channels who know their job,

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:57.134
they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

01:39:57.848 --> 01:39:59.929
You are special people no doubt.

01:40:00.001 --> 01:40:02.261
Otherwise why are you here?

01:40:02.324 --> 01:40:11.806
But that specialty is this
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

01:40:11.996 --> 01:40:14.165
You are a wonderful conductor.

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.961
You are an expert on that.

01:40:16.025 --> 01:40:17.804
It just works.

01:40:18.011 --> 01:40:24.905
It works automatically
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:28.928
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:33.764
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

01:40:33.979 --> 01:40:38.604
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

01:40:38.739 --> 01:40:41.797
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

01:40:42.008 --> 01:40:44.544
I am just an ordinary housewife.

01:40:45.544 --> 01:40:48.304
What? It’s just My love.

01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:52.644
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:57.674
that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

01:40:57.897 --> 01:41:01.826
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:05.241
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

01:41:05.408 --> 01:41:09.065
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

01:41:09.162 --> 01:41:12.926
The point is, I knew what I was.

01:41:13.079 --> 01:41:17.618
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

01:41:17.864 --> 01:41:20.153
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

01:41:20.366 --> 01:41:26.986
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself,
you can be dynamic.

01:41:27.121 --> 01:41:31.636
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

01:41:31.763 --> 01:41:36.521
you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

01:41:36.696 --> 01:41:39.312
All these drop out like that.

01:41:39.651 --> 01:41:44.531
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

01:41:44.796 --> 01:41:51.552
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

01:41:52.586 --> 01:41:55.766
And we should get concerned about that.

01:41:55.934 --> 01:41:59.364
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

01:41:59.397 --> 01:42:01.693
I went to jail, everything I did.

01:42:01.801 --> 01:42:07.730
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

01:42:07.952 --> 01:42:09.288
That was different.

01:42:09.466 --> 01:42:12.634
But after that independence what should have happened

01:42:12.713 --> 01:42:17.192
is to make people realize what they are.

01:42:17.969 --> 01:42:21.961
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

01:42:22.032 --> 01:42:24.985
what is the need of that country.

01:42:25.167 --> 01:42:33.518
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

01:42:33.858 --> 01:42:38.674
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

01:42:38.738 --> 01:42:42.664
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

01:42:42.799 --> 01:42:48.685
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

01:42:49.186 --> 01:42:51.217
You are so empowered.

01:42:51.503 --> 01:42:56.495
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

01:42:56.568 --> 01:43:00.794
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

01:43:00.974 --> 01:43:04.328
But still all of you have to do it.

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:09.478
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

01:43:09.566 --> 01:43:13.911
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:17.489
I have not changed much because within Myself

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:22.806
I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

01:43:23.235 --> 01:43:26.281
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

01:43:26.448 --> 01:43:32.346
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

01:43:32.656 --> 01:43:39.572
that nothing is important than to know what you are.

01:43:39.771 --> 01:43:42.743
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

01:43:43.074 --> 01:43:44.577
Nothing matters.

01:43:44.714 --> 01:43:47.624
What is important is to know yourself.

01:43:47.855 --> 01:43:51.770
I’m surprised very little has been written

01:43:51.906 --> 01:43:55.270
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

01:43:55.476 --> 01:43:58.007
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

01:43:58.238 --> 01:44:03.053
about Tao and meaning that what you are.

01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:06.780
Tao means what you are, and he describes

01:44:06.971 --> 01:44:12.431
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

01:44:12.637 --> 01:44:16.034
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

01:44:16.138 --> 01:44:19.830
how to reach that state was not given. He only described

01:44:19.894 --> 01:44:24.281
people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

01:44:24.384 --> 01:44:27.447
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

01:44:27.535 --> 01:44:31.217
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

01:44:31.447 --> 01:44:34.060
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

01:44:34.176 --> 01:44:38.445
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

01:44:38.685 --> 01:44:43.250
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

01:44:43.878 --> 01:44:46.834
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

01:44:46.897 --> 01:44:49.054
he described so beautifully.

01:44:49.553 --> 01:44:53.922
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

01:44:54.144 --> 01:44:56.665
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

01:44:57.614 --> 01:45:01.765
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

01:45:01.836 --> 01:45:05.285
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

01:45:05.475 --> 01:45:09.915
it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

01:45:10.026 --> 01:45:13.553
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

01:45:13.757 --> 01:45:17.702
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

01:45:17.722 --> 01:45:20.718
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

01:45:21.103 --> 01:45:23.365
that you should be in your balance.

01:45:23.518 --> 01:45:26.910
Now many people say who have given up smoking

01:45:27.053 --> 01:45:31.961
have again started smoking,
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

01:45:32.072 --> 01:45:34.622
That means you have lost your maryadas.

01:45:34.772 --> 01:45:39.012
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

01:45:39.155 --> 01:45:42.361
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

01:45:42.786 --> 01:45:44.647
You must watch yourself.

01:45:44.765 --> 01:45:46.595
You call him, “Hello Mister.

01:45:46.595 --> 01:45:48.535
So now, what are you up to?”

01:45:48.644 --> 01:45:51.830
Then you will see how your mind is working.

01:45:52.302 --> 01:45:55.878
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

01:45:56.093 --> 01:46:00.674
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

01:46:01.849 --> 01:46:04.316
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

01:46:04.515 --> 01:46:07.713
that ocean is the lowest thing.

01:46:08.069 --> 01:46:12.101
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

01:46:12.267 --> 01:46:15.674
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

01:46:16.056 --> 01:46:18.845
So, it keeps at the lowest.

01:46:19.085 --> 01:46:23.151
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:27.768
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

01:46:28.125 --> 01:46:32.747
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

01:46:33.327 --> 01:46:36.481
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

01:46:36.703 --> 01:46:42.714
And, the whole circle is created that
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

01:46:42.981 --> 01:46:46.652
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:50.655
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

01:46:50.925 --> 01:46:55.915
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.649
At the lowest point.

01:46:58.848 --> 01:47:02.749
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

01:47:02.837 --> 01:47:05.777
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

01:47:05.841 --> 01:47:08.391
But see that you are the lowest.

01:47:08.478 --> 01:47:13.626
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

01:47:13.761 --> 01:47:16.762
that everything will come to you.

01:47:17.601 --> 01:47:21.141
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:26.012
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

01:47:26.123 --> 01:47:29.198
that you know that you are the highest.

01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:36.636
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

01:47:36.911 --> 01:47:40.339
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

01:47:40.492 --> 01:47:42.902
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

01:47:43.371 --> 01:47:45.941
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

01:47:46.105 --> 01:47:48.912
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

01:47:49.138 --> 01:47:50.765
What is the problem there?

01:47:51.051 --> 01:47:54.826
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

01:47:54.874 --> 01:48:03.401
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

01:48:05.664 --> 01:48:10.073
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

01:48:10.557 --> 01:48:16.530
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

01:48:17.132 --> 01:48:22.612
Same in our country, same in your country and everybody’s country.

01:48:22.834 --> 01:48:27.662
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

01:48:27.789 --> 01:48:32.149
and we must have Sahaja Yogis who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

01:48:33.062 --> 01:48:39.485
To be very much confident of the fact that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.001
And why not?

01:48:41.126 --> 01:48:44.107
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

01:48:44.484 --> 01:48:46.976
You are My children. You can do it.

01:48:47.125 --> 01:48:51.005
But the confidence should be there that as

01:48:51.228 --> 01:48:56.684
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

01:48:56.827 --> 01:49:00.523
because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

01:49:00.738 --> 01:49:04.417
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

01:49:04.544 --> 01:49:07.330
which stands at the lowest point.

01:49:08.052 --> 01:49:10.032
In the same way, it works out.

01:49:10.223 --> 01:49:12.829
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

01:49:12.957 --> 01:49:18.111
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

01:49:18.436 --> 01:49:21.475
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

01:49:21.602 --> 01:49:26.374
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

01:49:26.558 --> 01:49:31.181
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

01:49:31.427 --> 01:49:34.279
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

01:49:34.445 --> 01:49:39.260
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

01:49:39.393 --> 01:49:42.973
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

01:49:43.256 --> 01:49:46.509
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

01:49:46.684 --> 01:49:51.646
which you should discover.
You have got also peace giving qualities.

01:49:51.863 --> 01:49:55.826
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:59.474
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

01:49:59.562 --> 01:50:02.331
in case your peace is established.

01:50:03.222 --> 01:50:09.236
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

01:50:09.978 --> 01:50:15.813
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

01:50:15.957 --> 01:50:20.047
and findout what is lacking.

01:50:20.443 --> 01:50:26.522
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

01:50:28.591 --> 01:50:32.746
They can explode all the myths of the world.

01:50:32.891 --> 01:50:34.357
I know that.

01:50:34.726 --> 01:50:39.928
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

01:50:40.134 --> 01:50:43.528
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:48.182
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

01:50:48.372 --> 01:50:52.988
then give Me this, that you show your confidence

01:50:53.163 --> 01:50:55.597
and you work it out wherever you are.

01:50:55.785 --> 01:50:57.526
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

01:50:57.644 --> 01:50:59.247
You don’t have to change anything.

01:50:59.391 --> 01:51:03.707
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

01:51:03.787 --> 01:51:09.687
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:14.906
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

01:51:15.076 --> 01:51:20.176
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

01:51:20.319 --> 01:51:24.665
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

01:51:24.776 --> 01:51:29.511
subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

01:51:29.778 --> 01:51:31.498
May God Bless you.
