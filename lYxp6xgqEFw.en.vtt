00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:14.741
I am happy to know so many of you have come
here and I feel this is a very important puja,

00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:20.620
not only for Australia but for the whole world,
because it has the greatest message which

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.631
we have actualized now in Sahaja yoga.

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:30.371
We have to understand the message of Christ.

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:35.691
There are many people in this world who try
to show off that they are very great rationalists

00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:43.291
and that they have a right to pass any remark
they like about Christ.

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:47.091
I was reading the newspapers today.

00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:57.751
I was surprised where they are all saying
one by one that, "I reject this part of Christ

00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:00.391
that He was born with Immaculate Conception.

00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.031
I reject that He was resurrected.

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:05.900
I reject this and I reject that."

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.580
Who are you?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:18.441
Because you can write, because you have a
flair, how can you say such things?

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:20.311
Just without finding out.

00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:25.571
You are a scholar, maybe you are very well
read, maybe that you think you are capable

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:34.501
of saying whatever you like about any subject,
but subject of spirituality cannot be dealt

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:39.401
by people who are not even self-realized.

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:45.921
Because it's a very divine life, it's a very
different life.

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:52.660
It's a area where your mind cannot enter.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.841
It is beyond the mind.

00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:06.481
And so the poets or artists, all of them who
have worked on Christ's life and have tried

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:13.921
to say things about Him, mostly were realized
souls and if they were not, they could not

00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:16.881
do any justice to His life.

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:25.350
It's very surprising that I should be celebrating
this resurrection in Australia.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:38.951
You know this is the country of mooladhara,
and mooladhara itself then expresses itself

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:43.411
or manifests in the agnya.

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:58.831
So, such a great connection you have that
first of all is the country where mooladhara

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:05.731
is established, was established I should say,
and later on that it was manifested in the

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:11.261
life of Christ on the agnya center.

00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:21.411
I must say that you have really created some
very great people signifying this beautiful

00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:30.740
manifestation because, as you have Dr. Bogdan
who is an Australian, in the sense that he

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:40.381
lived here and then he went back to Russia
which is the right agnya, where he worked.

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:49.291
In the same way, as Sahaja yoga has prospered
here to begin with, among all the European

00:03:49.291 --> 00:04:08.031
countries, or we can say, among all the countries
which were not Indian, maximum growth took

00:04:08.031 --> 00:04:17.621
place in Australia and the maximum growth
now first took place in the Eastern Bloc,

00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:18.621
in Russia.

00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:25.681
Now the other part of the agnya is China.

00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:35.151
And it is you people only... out of you only
some people have to look after that.

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:46.350
And as it is you're all looking after Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Thailand.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:54.640
All these are Chinese races.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.760
Apart from that, they worship Buddha.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.640
It's very interesting.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:09.510
Buddha, as you know, is on the left side of
your medha, as they call it, this is the medha

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.271
plate, is the lower plate of the brain.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:21.480
So the Christ is in the center and we've got
Buddha on the left side.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.010
Or, you also are looking after the countries
which are influenced by Buddha.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.950
It's all working out like a plan.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:43.991
Perhaps you're not aware of it, that we are
all people belonging to one Virata and that

00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:54.060
our needs or our work, all of them have great
significance and connection.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:08.271
About Australia, there's a myth in India that
there was a big saint and he was very good,

00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:15.151
but somehow he made some mistakes... or maybe
lots of mistakes.

00:06:15.151 --> 00:06:19.620
So God cursed him and said you better go away
from India.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.000
It was connecting India and Africa.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.961
So the land was brought down to this point.

00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:34.241
He gave him the land - God - and He said,
"Now you resurrect this land and make something

00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:36.901
out of it."

00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:43.521
And this star is called as this Trishanku
[MEANS As per Indian Mythology, a saint king

00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:45.611
who wished to go to heaven alive, but was
stopped &amp; kept hanging in between by Gods,

00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:47.831
as he was being sent by Sage Vishwamitra,
and then became a star], which is your Southern

00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:48.831
Cross.

00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.000
This Southern Cross is called as Trishanku,
as in... mentioned in our Puranas [MEANS One

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.720
type of Indian scriptures] as this saint who
became like that and God made him into a star

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720
which is hanging.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:15.831
Trishanku is hanging on top of this land and
is working out the building up of this country.

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:23.161
He was told that you go there and make a heaven
for the human beings.

00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:35.090
This has so many mythological and historical
backgrounds.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.140
And there are some very good points also I
have seen about Australia, which are very

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.850
surprising because they believe in the multi-racial
society and they preserve it.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:56.861
They try to help the people through justice
if some people are troubled and tortured.

00:07:56.861 --> 00:08:04.560
It's a very bold attitude towards progress
that we should have multicultural society

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:15.170
and this comes, again I would say, after resurrection
of political thought.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:28.321
America is multicultural society, full of
it, and as a result of that, as a result of

00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:33.781
that they have progressed very much financially.

00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:42.820
But they didn't learn anything from the multicultural
society.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.261
For example, Spanish went there.

00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:48.991
Spanish, as you know, are bullfighters.

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:58.091
They went and destroyed all the cultures of
the ancient times and the new people who have

00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:01.421
gone, they don't have any rapport with them.

00:09:01.421 --> 00:09:09.141
Like Indians have a separate identity, then
we have other cultures like Islamic and all

00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:13.121
that, so they don't keep any connection with
them.

00:09:13.121 --> 00:09:21.221
The original aboriginals are also kept out
as something very low-level.

00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:29.830
But here I find people have a curiosity and
also knowledge about the other cultures which

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.001
are around them.

00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:44.371
That shows the sense of collectivity is within
your genes, we can say, that it is working

00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:54.020
out in such a way that this country believes
still in the multicultural society.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.411
All these are manifestation of Shri Ganesha's
quality.

00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:10.190
See if you have, say, a group of even ten
people with husband and wife and they don't

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:20.150
have the purity of Shri Ganesha, they cannot
exist because there will be always a very

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.381
great conflict between husband and wife.

00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:31.820
Also, not only the conflict part, but people
will become extremely superficial.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:42.320
Like, in America a woman would marry a man
because he wears such and such dress; or a

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.681
woman is appreciated because she has a particular
type of hairstyle.

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:52.501
If the hairstyle changes, the man can ask
for a divorce.

00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:55.650
So superficial they are.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.601
The fight is with the husband that you didn't
buy a particular coat which I liked, so there's

00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:02.121
a divorce.

00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:04.411
It's so superficial.

00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:12.871
So the relationship between husband and wife
is established by Shri Ganesh and He gives

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:19.741
you the pure idea about how to enjoy your
married life.

00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:24.771
Why people like Freud become so important?

00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:35.541
They start replacing Christ and people become
enamored by that.

00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:44.681
Because human beings, if they know that in
potential state they are all divine, they

00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:53.260
all have to become divine and not to go down
to the level of animals, even worse than that.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:12:02.491
If they realize it that their main object
of life is resurrection, that they have to

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:10.471
rise above all these so-called temptations
of life.

00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:27.630
If they know this potential, then they have
to believe in it also, so that they do not

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:34.101
have these absurd ideas about life.

00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:37.821
As a human being, Christ came.

00:12:37.821 --> 00:12:41.751
He came as a human being, but He was not a
human being.

00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:42.931
He was divine.

00:12:42.931 --> 00:12:45.590
Absolutely He was nothing but Aumkara.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:50.111
That's why He could walk on the water.

00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:54.971
There was nothing materialistic in Him, you
can say, no matter in Him.

00:12:54.971 --> 00:13:01.840
If there was any matter, He could not have
walked on the water.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:08.871
But if people start discarding all these facts,
about His birth, about His walking on the

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:17.710
water and all that, then what is left of Christ,
I can't understand.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:23.951
Now this message of His resurrection is very
important, but what you find that, as you

00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:27.421
get three days holidays, people are just doing
what one should not do.

00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:36.311
They have gone to some places, maybe with
their wives, may not be with their wives,

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:45.690
with anybody, into some sort of a rubbish
and they enjoy things which cannot be enjoyed

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.000
by anybody who is a realized soul.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.161
So we have to know ourself that now we have
got our realization.

00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:55.190
We got it.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:00.340
Not that it is in a potential state, but it
is in a kinetic state.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:08.931
So, for us Christ should be a model, what
kind of life we should lead.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:16.280
In those days of Christ, there were no aeroplanes,
there were no cars, nothing, but He went from

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.280
places to places and talked to them about
spiritual life.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.630
The people were not yet evolved.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:29.260
They were not matured enough.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:37.141
So He could not give them realization, but
He talked about dharmic life.

00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:51.431
He went to the extreme of the ten commandments
that He said not only that you should not

00:14:51.431 --> 00:14:55.890
do adultery, but you should not even have
adulterous eyes.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.101
Pure eyes.

00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:02.131
Now how is it possible?

00:15:02.131 --> 00:15:10.010
When you see Christians and Christian nations,
they suffer from this disease of not having

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.320
at all clean eyes.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:21.121
There's a kind of a lust and greed in the
eye and they're not ashamed of it.

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:30.070
Thank God, Sahaja Yogis all over the world
have changed so much, transformed so much.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.060
They've become so beautiful that this problem
we don't have.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:40.991
And if somebody has it, we want that person
to get out of Sahaja yoga till they cure themselves

00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:45.020
and come to normal.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:52.400
The main problem of the Christian nation is
that they have become too much mental.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.601
Even sex they do mentally, in the sense [that]
they flirt.

00:15:58.601 --> 00:16:07.570
The eyes are so much all the time looking
at something and reacting to it.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.921
They cannot witness anything.

00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:19.150
Anything they'll see they start thinking about
it, react to it.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:29.390
Then the reaction, because they are not evolved,
can take them to any level of bestiality - Worse

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.071
than beasts.

00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:43.881
For example, an innocent person sees something,
he goes into thoughtless awareness and he

00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:51.051
just enjoys the beauty of that; but a person
who is full of lust and greed can never enjoy

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:52.051
anything.

00:16:52.051 --> 00:17:01.871
On the contrary, he would like to possess
that thing or would go beyond limits of his

00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:08.681
authority and enjoy somebody else's wife,
somebody else's husband.

00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:16.041
It's a very subtle thing, which we should
understand when we make friendship with others.

00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:19.741
What do we enjoy in the friendship?

00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:23.821
What do we see in that friendship?

00:17:23.821 --> 00:17:28.160
As realized soul, how your friendship should
be?

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.651
The friendship should be pure - nirvajya.

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:42.891
That is, you're friendly with somebody because
just you enjoy the pure friendship, where

00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:54.971
there's no sense of possession or also the
sense of destruction.

00:17:54.971 --> 00:18:03.050
Such a friendship is a Sahaj friendship.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:10.271
I have seen people all over the world, when
they come to Ganapatipule, the way they laugh,

00:18:10.271 --> 00:18:20.221
the way they enjoy and I feel so happy there's
this new world of such innocent people has

00:18:20.221 --> 00:18:23.371
been created on this Earth in My lifetime.

00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:32.721
You should also realize that you belong now
to a very higher type of people, very higher

00:18:32.721 --> 00:18:33.721
type.

00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:45.741
There's no justification for any Sahaja Yogi
to indulge into such dirty stuff, because

00:18:45.741 --> 00:18:47.011
he is beyond it.

00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:54.160
He has developed a new sense of beauty and
cleanliness.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:04.221
He cannot bear anything, which makes him look
like a person who goes towards all kinds of

00:19:04.221 --> 00:19:05.400
filthy things.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:13.391
This is a specialty, which you have got it,
which was potentially within you and despite

00:19:13.391 --> 00:19:19.411
the atmosphere in which you lived and you
saw, you just got out of it and became like

00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:24.481
beautiful lotuses in the pond of filth.

00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:34.930
And these lotuses themselves can give such
beautiful fragrance to others that they can

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.241
make the whole pond fragrant and beautiful.

00:19:38.241 --> 00:19:46.781
So the responsibility on you is much more
than, I would say, on Christ because Christ

00:19:46.781 --> 00:19:47.911
was divine.

00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:52.211
I was asking them to get Devi Mahatmyam, if
possible.

00:19:52.211 --> 00:20:02.321
In that He's described as the son of Lord
Krishna and Radhaji and that He has been given

00:20:02.321 --> 00:20:08.770
a special power and is called as a Support
of the Universe.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.491
Just imagine.

00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:11.491
Mooladhar.

00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:14.060
He is the Support of the Universe.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:27.421
And the birth is described in a beautiful
way that first He was created like an egg.

00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:30.821
This purity, this auspiciousness was made
into an egg.

00:20:30.821 --> 00:20:35.951
That's why during Easter you people give eggs
to friends.

00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:48.180
Now this egg was nicely also kept for ages
and then it was broken into two.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:57.400
The first one became Shri Ganesha and the
second one, which evolved fully... like an

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:06.701
egg when it is evolved and is fully mature,
the second one was Christ.

00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:14.531
You may say that, "How is it one egg has two
forms?"

00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:18.321
I must say these are divine happenings.

00:21:18.321 --> 00:21:24.921
They have very different from what we see
in the mundane world.

00:21:24.921 --> 00:21:33.581
Now, this egg, the second part of it, became
a child and He was crying for His Father.

00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:42.611
All His life, Christ talked for His Father
and when He knew He] will be crucified, He

00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:54.491
prayed to His Father saying that "Oh Father,
save Me from this cup of crucifixion," He

00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:55.491
prayed.

00:21:55.491 --> 00:22:03.331
And if you see His two fingers, these two
fingers are always out - expression of His

00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:04.331
blessing.

00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:10.290
This is the one, which stands, as you know
very well, for Shri Krishna, and this one

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.310
for Vishnu.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.371
So always He showed these two fingers.

00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:25.670
There are so many things by which we can,
as Sahaja Yogis, find out how Christ has been

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.991
ruling throughout.

00:22:26.991 --> 00:22:30.751
He is not dead.

00:22:30.751 --> 00:22:43.270
His body might have been perished in Kashmir,
as they say, but He was the spirit and the

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:57.821
spirit that was in Him was a living, eternally
living, great personality.

00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:09.270
We may say that He might have had little bit
of, we can say, the human aspect to camouflage

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:18.430
Himself, after all spirit just cannot come
in, and that might have been dead, that part,

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.831
that camouflage that He was using.

00:23:21.831 --> 00:23:40.211
In divinity, as Ganesha is pure, He is absolutely
beyond any kind of contamination.

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:45.780
Other incarnations who came on this Earth,
they had to do many things.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:53.331
Like Shri Krishna had to go in the war of
Mahabharata.

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:58.391
Rama had to go in the jungle to deal with
people.

00:23:58.391 --> 00:24:08.741
Same with Christ, we can say, that He did
go to all these places, but He never behaved

00:24:08.741 --> 00:24:09.741
like a human being.

00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:10.741
Others did.

00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:17.961
Shri Rama cried a lot, wept a lot for His
wife.

00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:29.361
Then Shri Krishna married so many times - because
they were His powers so He married them.

00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:34.381
So, though they were incarnations, they had
to very much do the things which human beings

00:24:34.381 --> 00:24:35.381
do.

00:24:35.381 --> 00:24:36.831
Christ was never married.

00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:44.290
He never wept, as far as we know, except when
He was praying to His Father.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:53.831
He just asked that "If You could remove this
cup from My mouth I'll be very happy."

00:24:53.831 --> 00:24:58.851
So it's shown in His character that He came
on this Earth as a divine personality, lived

00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:05.410
as a divine personality and died as a divine
personality.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:14.841
I think that way it is much easier to be because
you are a divine person, you come, give some

00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:18.711
sermons, lectures, this, that and just go
away.

00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:24.711
He didn't take the responsibility of giving
realization to people, which is the greatest

00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:27.920
headache, I think, to give realizations to
people.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:36.081
Because, if you give them the resurrection,
if they get their realization...

00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:41.501
Christ accepted His resurrection as a natural
thing because He knew all about it, and that

00:25:41.501 --> 00:25:42.731
He didn't have to change.

00:25:42.731 --> 00:25:44.001
He didn't have to transform Himself.

00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:50.351
He was the same as He was because He did not
need any resurrection.

00:25:50.351 --> 00:25:57.831
He just tried to show in His life that we
human beings can have our realization and

00:25:57.831 --> 00:25:58.861
we can be resurrected.

00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:07.721
His message is not the cross but the resurrection
and this resurrection if you understand, then

00:26:07.721 --> 00:26:16.461
one can understand also one more thing - that
we are now resurrected from ordinary human

00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:19.420
beings to the divine level.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:27.400
It was easier for Christ because He didn't
have to face any problems, while you are coming

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:35.071
out of that human life to a such a higher
life.

00:26:35.071 --> 00:26:37.751
Suddenly, it is too much.

00:26:37.751 --> 00:26:38.941
I agree.

00:26:38.941 --> 00:26:43.251
It is too much to accept.

00:26:43.251 --> 00:26:56.371
But because you go beyond your mind, it's
not difficult - because your mind stops thinking.

00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:02.761
Otherwise, normally people would have been
thinking, "Now, I am resurrected.

00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:03.761
All right.

00:27:03.761 --> 00:27:06.050
So what should I do?

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.400
What should I drop out?

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.191
What things should go away?

00:27:10.191 --> 00:27:12.901
What is the goal?"

00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:17.211
All these ideas of human beings would have
followed you slowly.

00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:22.790
But no, you just felt, "We are there.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.831
Now what to do?

00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:28.111
We are there."

00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:35.611
You became conscious of your qualities, of
your virtues, of your greatness and those

00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:43.741
who were conscious became very confident that
we have these values already existing within

00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:52.451
us; we have these powers, which are manifesting
and these powers are flowing through us.

00:27:52.451 --> 00:27:53.790
Nobody doubted it.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.160
Some did, but very few.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:02.400
As you grew up, immediately you knew that
the Divine is acting through you.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.001
Is there.

00:28:04.001 --> 00:28:05.001
Everything is tangible.

00:28:05.001 --> 00:28:07.901
You know everything about your inner being.

00:28:07.901 --> 00:28:16.201
Gradually, you start spreading out your self,
spreading out your personality.

00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:21.281
And then you don't have the weaknesses as
human beings have.

00:28:21.281 --> 00:28:23.800
We had some funny people, no doubt.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.310
I know that people start thinking about how
to make money out of Sahaja Yoga, - and that's

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:36.881
still a human nonsense going on - or how to
show your powers, how to show how your powers

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:48.091
can assert, how to sort of use your ego to
put down people.

00:28:48.091 --> 00:29:00.731
All these are human style of lives and it
existed for some time, but now I find you

00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:06.550
all are washed as if through this kundalini
has just washed you completely.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.882
You all have become very beautiful people,
extremely beautiful, and even people... they

00:29:07.882 --> 00:29:13.701
see you at the airport and they think that
these are some unique people.

00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:20.301
Even in this area when we came, they were
telling Me that... the gentleman who is the

00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:29.091
caretaker was saying that he has never seen
such a group - "They don't fight; they don't

00:29:29.091 --> 00:29:34.020
argue; they don't make money; the children
are so sweet.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:43.170
It's remarkable, such a society in these modern
times never existed anywhere and how is it,

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.461
it is existing here?"

00:29:44.461 --> 00:29:51.091
They were quite surprised as, also you should
be, that you have achieved this without any

00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:57.351
much effort or any penance or going to Himalayas.

00:29:57.351 --> 00:30:01.131
You got it because it was all there.

00:30:01.131 --> 00:30:03.810
It was all there and you found it.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.821
Our marriages are, ninety percent are successful.

00:30:05.821 --> 00:30:14.261
We have problems from the parents sometimes,
from the society, but it's too little to be

00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:25.680
mentioned and it makes one sense to Me - that
we can really change this world.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.451
No doubt about it.

00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:35.101
If you remember that the message of Christ
is resurrection, that has already happened.

00:30:35.101 --> 00:30:38.621
Now, after resurrection what?

00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:41.550
Your attention should be there.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:46.160
If it is still on your job, on your money,
on your car, your house, this, that, then

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.511
you are still a human being.

00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:54.261
You have not yet lost that attachment.

00:30:54.261 --> 00:30:59.060
Or on your children and your spouses and all.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:03.721
That is all being still absolutely human.

00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:10.221
But a person who is divine has all the relations
but doesn't get attached and involved into.

00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:16.430
I've given many a time a very good] example
of the trees.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:24.290
See in the tree the sap rises, goes to various
parts of the tree, either it is evaporated

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.390
or it goes back to Mother Earth.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.280
It never gets attached to anything.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:35.491
As long you are attached to your children,
attached to this, attached to that, then try

00:31:35.491 --> 00:31:39.510
to understand that divinity has not fully
manifested.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:45.380
That detachment is not neglect, never.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:59.890
On the contrary, it is the most pure detachment,
which really nourishes every area of your

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.890
life.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.571
Wherever you go, it nourishes.

00:32:03.571 --> 00:32:06.920
So you have to test yourself.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.760
Nobody else has to do it.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.050
"How far I have been kind to others?

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.670
How far I have been helpful to others?

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.971
How far I have been collective?"

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:25.060
I have seen glimpses of this many a times
and it has given Me great joy.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:34.001
Like, once we had a program of Sahaja yogis
and the gentleman had invited Me alone for

00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:35.001
dinner.

00:32:35.001 --> 00:32:42.441
So the program was there and I just thought
that how can all these people eat in his house,

00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:43.731
you see?

00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:49.920
So I waited till they disappeared, all the
Sahaja Yogis disappeared.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.961
This gentleman came to say, "Mother why did
you ask them to go?

00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:53.800
I had cooked for all of them."

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.541
See this made Me so happy.

00:32:55.541 --> 00:32:57.041
He had a small house.

00:32:57.041 --> 00:33:01.101
I don't know how he cooked for all of them.

00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:05.721
And so much food he had cooked already and
he was waiting - all of them to have some

00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:11.921
food, and I just thought that it is too much
for him to feed so many people.

00:33:11.921 --> 00:33:20.921
In the same way, we have to have this feeling
that we are all collective and we have to

00:33:20.921 --> 00:33:21.921
help each other.

00:33:21.921 --> 00:33:26.800
It is, say in the body, if I have any problem
in any finger, any hand, anywhere, the whole

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:36.201
body runs for it, the whole body suffers for
it, whole body knows about it.

00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:43.381
In the same way, in Sahaja Yoga there should
be a common feeling all over the world.

00:33:43.381 --> 00:33:52.010
If something happens here, one person is affected,
the whole world should know.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:55.650
Not only that know, but they should make efforts.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:01.781
If one person is suffering, the whole world
will suffer for that and this is what is the

00:34:01.781 --> 00:34:03.271
culmination of our collectivity.

00:34:03.271 --> 00:34:11.291
Those who try to keep out of it, you see,
in the collectivity, cannot grow also.

00:34:11.291 --> 00:34:19.451
About many things I have to say, but specially
I would say that when we see somebody in difficulties,

00:34:19.451 --> 00:34:25.571
say financial difficulty, at that time we
should try to suggest or try to help that

00:34:25.571 --> 00:34:29.971
person as just a part and parcel of the whole.

00:34:29.971 --> 00:34:34.761
Then that person will realize that I have
so many people here.

00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:36.301
I am not alone.

00:34:36.301 --> 00:34:42.121
Somebody might get more, somebody might get
less, makes no difference.

00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:49.531
But the activity of the collective should
be such that you should feel that oneness,

00:34:49.531 --> 00:34:56.211
that innate feeling for another person, innate.

00:34:56.211 --> 00:35:04.511
You not have to think about it, but is innately
you should feel attached to that person and

00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:07.971
you should feel that you have to do something
about it.

00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:14.391
"After all, why should he not have the same
joy as I have?"

00:35:14.391 --> 00:35:20.571
So the first thing that you will do, of such
people, is normally... is to help him in his

00:35:20.571 --> 00:35:22.721
chakras, help him in his endeavors.

00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:29.011
It is very easy now to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:29.011 --> 00:35:34.001
In the olden times, it was very difficult.

00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:37.701
If you had tried Sahaja Yoga say, in the early
time of Christ, you all might have been crucified.

00:35:37.701 --> 00:35:38.911
Could be.

00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:40.711
What did Christ do after all?

00:35:40.711 --> 00:35:41.711
Why was He crucified?

00:35:41.711 --> 00:35:43.671
But nowadays that's not so.

00:35:43.671 --> 00:35:46.211
Then you...

00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:54.341
like other saints, any people in India, "Thousands
of years," they said, "we have been meditating.

00:35:54.341 --> 00:36:04.911
We started our meditation when we were nothing
and now years after years, our different births

00:36:04.911 --> 00:36:11.931
after births, we have worked hard to get to
this situation, that now we have got realization."

00:36:11.931 --> 00:36:13.811
You don't have that problem.

00:36:13.811 --> 00:36:17.361
There's no problem at all.

00:36:17.361 --> 00:36:26.391
Except for one, that you have to have full
assessment of yourself, that you are the pure

00:36:26.391 --> 00:36:30.571
Spirit and that you are in the kingdom of
God.

00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:34.281
Just like Christ - it did not matter to Him.

00:36:34.281 --> 00:36:37.901
He had to oppose something that was wrong,
He did it.

00:36:37.901 --> 00:36:42.451
When He had to support something was destroyed
and saved, He did it.

00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:49.001
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalene,
but when people started stoning her, He went

00:36:49.001 --> 00:36:55.861
and stood before her and He said, "Those who
have not committed any sin, can throw stone

00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:56.861
at her."

00:36:56.861 --> 00:37:03.232
See this courage, this confidence was in Him
because He was a divine personality, because

00:37:03.232 --> 00:37:04.261
of divinity.

00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:06.171
But you have become divine.

00:37:06.171 --> 00:37:13.511
In a way, you know better about life than
He knew because He never touched all these

00:37:13.511 --> 00:37:17.571
points that you have touched from what problems
you have come out.

00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:22.961
So, you should have much more understanding
for people who are not in Sahaja Yoga or who

00:37:22.961 --> 00:37:23.961
want to come to Sahaj Yoga.

00:37:23.961 --> 00:37:28.911
Like, as soon as they come to any program,
you should not start saying, "You are a bhoot,

00:37:28.911 --> 00:37:30.471
you are that."

00:37:30.471 --> 00:37:34.121
You were a bhoot before you came here.

00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:40.631
Quite a big bhoot, if you ask Me, I can tell
you.

00:37:40.631 --> 00:37:51.871
But when you realize what is your importance
- now you have become qualified.

00:37:51.871 --> 00:37:54.941
You know everything about it.

00:37:54.941 --> 00:38:02.621
When you know that this has happened, then
try just to follow few rules about Sahaja

00:38:02.621 --> 00:38:03.621
Yoga.

00:38:03.621 --> 00:38:07.871
It's very easy for you to follow because you
are divine.

00:38:07.871 --> 00:38:08.871
No problem.

00:38:08.871 --> 00:38:09.871
No problem.

00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:16.421
You can follow it very well, but don't yield
to human pressures that still linger in you

00:38:16.421 --> 00:38:18.691
or may be in the society.

00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:25.781
You keep to your own style, to your own behavior
and you'll be amazed that the rest of the

00:38:25.781 --> 00:38:29.781
world will worship you - not hang you, but
worship you.

00:38:29.781 --> 00:38:32.141
In your lifetime, it's going to happen.

00:38:32.141 --> 00:38:40.961
But try to understand that you are being resurrected
for a purpose, and that purpose is to transform

00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:46.121
this world into a beautiful place for which
all of you should, with full attention, with

00:38:46.121 --> 00:38:50.841
full understanding about yourself, about your
responsibilities, should jump into it.

00:38:50.841 --> 00:38:54.641
Australia has a special responsibility.

00:38:54.641 --> 00:39:04.181
As I told you, some are so over-responsible
and some are not at all.

00:39:04.181 --> 00:39:12.461
I can't understand why it is so, why it (is)
happening like that.

00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:19.711
I see people who are so attentive and some
whose attention is still not all right - moving

00:39:19.711 --> 00:39:22.571
like this, moving like that.

00:39:22.571 --> 00:39:27.581
So, you should try to follow people who have
reached a certain height.

00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:33.581
Try to follow their life, their lifestyle
and then you will be amazed that you can do

00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:35.251
it very easily because you are mature.

00:39:35.251 --> 00:39:41.601
It's like, I have said that we are like an
egg and it has to be hatched once you are

00:39:41.601 --> 00:39:43.271
mature, but some chicks come out and just
start walking nicely, with little, little

00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:48.831
legs you see them very nicely walking towards
the mother.

00:39:48.831 --> 00:39:59.381
And the others are still there covered with
all kinds of filth on them and not able to

00:39:59.381 --> 00:40:06.161
walk and then these ones who can walk just
bring them, you see, they poke them with their

00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:11.121
beaks and say, "Come along, come along, come
along" and they bring it to the mother.

00:40:11.121 --> 00:40:12.121
It's very interesting.

00:40:12.121 --> 00:40:13.121
You must watch them.

00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:21.601
This Easter has a great meaning that we are
now newly born chicks and we have to now follow

00:40:21.601 --> 00:40:23.531
a new path.

00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:28.221
It's a very simple path, but still we are
conditioned so we are afraid, maybe, or we

00:40:28.221 --> 00:40:30.071
have an ego, whatever it is.

00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:31.911
So drop out all these things.

00:40:31.911 --> 00:40:38.781
Just humble down and just start walking on
this path of Sahaj and one day Australia should

00:40:38.781 --> 00:40:41.201
be able to cover the whole world.

00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:43.351
I can't see why not?

00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:54.401
After all you are the mooladhara and the mooladhara
must play its own role as the wisest people.

00:40:54.401 --> 00:41:00.771
Wisdom is the power that you get from Shri
Ganesh.

00:41:00.771 --> 00:41:09.351
So you have to be wise, absolutely wise and
know that you have been seekers.

00:41:09.351 --> 00:41:12.231
You didn't get it because I asked you or we
paid you or anything, but you were seekers

00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:20.211
struggling to know the truth and that's how
you got it and once you have got it, you should

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:25.116
establish it fully in your life and also in
the lives of others.

00:41:25.141 --> 00:41:29.758
Let others also feel this gentleman is very
unique or this lady is very unique.

00:41:29.899 --> 00:41:36.467
She's very different, she's not selfish, she's
not cunning, she doesn't manipulate, but somehow

00:41:36.492 --> 00:41:45.343
by her character, by her nature she is trying
to create light for us and enlighten our path,

00:41:45.368 --> 00:41:47.739
enlighten the path of others.

00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:49.993
May God bless you all.
