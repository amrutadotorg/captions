00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.060
I am told that some of you have come

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.340
for the first time, for the program here

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.640
now, for the people who have come for the first time

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.070
they have to first get their realization

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.740
that is very important.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.380
Now, today I am feeling the atmosphere

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.640
today I think some of you have come from places

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.620
who have been to the people

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.300
who are doing black magic maybe

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.330
or some sort of a thing like that

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.980
or TSP or psychology, or to some false gurus. Some of you.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.970
And also that there are people who are feeling guilty

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.080
if you are feeling guilty, there is a catch on this finger

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.780
but if you are caching from people

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.150
who have been in black magic and fake gurus and all that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.570
then you catch on this finger and this thumb

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.940
also, I  think there are people who already feeling the vibrations

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.400
so we have people of all types

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.950
I am happy you have brought your children

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.370
because I am very happy with children

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.600
there are many children born, who are realised souls

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.500
And they don't understand human beings

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.900
who do not have that level

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.490
And that is a big problem

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.770
Moreover when these children grow up more

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.320
they take to new seeking

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.400
in which they fall a trap to drugs or false gurus

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.080
or some sort of a wrong thing

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.540
If the children are not given the training or understanding of the all vibrations

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.490
even if they are realised souls

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.710
they can go astray

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.230
in this modern time we cannot stop our children to go to wrong things

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.970
it's impossible, because life is such

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.230
to make them understand their value

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.480
and understand why they are on this earth

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.730
best is to give them Realisation if they are not realised at least

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.770
because they grow up, they get complicated, disappointed, frustrated

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.460
and they commit suicide also

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.950
so the interest of these children   which is progeny of our country

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.420
we have to give them Realisation

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.900
we are actually neglecting our children these days

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.580
because we are very busy

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.310
and children have so much time in hand

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.800
that they don't know what to do with themselves

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.830
once they get Realisation, they get very busy

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.660
my granddaughter, who was hardly of four, five years of age

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.410
when we went to the airport one day

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.750
she was just going like this all the time

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.150
because she is a born realised

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.920
the mother asked her "what are you doing all the time like this?"

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.630
She said: "I am trying to bind(?) all these people in the airport"

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.560
they are very very loose and running amok and they are very speedy.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.420
like this, they go mad only.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.680
They behave like their grandmothers I can tell you!

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.200
they understand sahaja yoga very well.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.640
The children who are born realised, takes no time to explain to them things.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.630
They understand it, relate to it

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.130
and they understand me very well.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.000
Because I speak the same language as they do.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.100
I am sure in this great country also

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:23.740
there must be many children many children who are born realised

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:36.250
if the parents and the teachers and professors get Realisation,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:42.340
they will understand these great souls that are born on this Earth.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.190
They will understand their children

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:03.400
and a beautiful rapport and relationship can be felt

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.260
I have seen when children see my photograph

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:26.350
they tell their parent: "You have to meet this Lady."

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:43.690
Because they understand that there is something common between Her and us

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.850
they are source of innocence for us and for the whole world.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.130
Innocence is holiness and auspiciousness.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:24.130
When we get our Realisation, our lost innocence is reestablished.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:40.750
We start enjoying world like a child enjoys it. It is fun.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.280
That is what Christ has said :

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.350
"you have to be like children to enter into the kingdom of God"

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:25.770
but today I find in the western countries especially children are attacked

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.370
their innocence is attacked

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.210
sometimes I feel that the countries where there is love for children

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.970
children take their birth more

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:53.870
that's why the birth rate is more in countries like India

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:26.870
after Realisation you like to spend your time with children and enjoy their company

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:32.890
because you enjoy their innocence as your innocence has been awakened

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:55.270
I am very happy that today you have brought your children with you, thank you for that

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.410
come along! come along!

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:14.290
alright, so for today, those who have not got their Realisation

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.500
we should see that they get their Realisation first

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.970
then I would like to work individually on all of you

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.880
to see that I establish the Realisation.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.770
Now, those who haven't got Realisation

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:03.310
the sahaja yogis who are here will pay special attention.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.330
Now, those who have not had cool breeze in their hand, yesterday

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:26.100
and today who have come for the first time, please raise your hands

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.050
but you are feeling cool breeze alright, aren't you?

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.890
she is born realised

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.910
what about you people?

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.020
are you feeling cool breeze in the hands?

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.200
what about you?

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.680
all born realised, they are all born realised

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.740
see they have got it

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.470
these children? are you feeling cool breeze in your hands?

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.370
my children, yes, great !

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.820
see, I told you, they don't need anything

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.110
they are already feeling it, I knew, I could see

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.570
and the little one there, are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.200
they are going to have[unclear]

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.320
what about little thing there?

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.340
are you feeling cool breeze?

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.120
yes, the next little one

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.960
alright, he is feeling

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.270
I told you, you have got more realised children

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.080
alright, so now. yes?

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:59.950
sahaja yogi: when I see you my heart it's much better

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.890
Shri Mataji: put your right hand on your heart, right hand

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.820
and then chanting has to be done

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.240
that: "Mother I am the Spirit !" inside

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.540
then the heart will be always be alright

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:18.650
because in the heart resides the Spirit

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.960
Shri Mataji: you too have a problem?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:52.530
Sahaji: he is saying that the spiritual heart is on the right

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.600
Shri Mataji: no, on the left. Spiritual heart on the left

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.470
on the right there is also, we believe in that also

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.270
on the right, there is another centre

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.540
which is the father's centre

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.930
it is another aspect of God

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:23.860
which is a Father, who is the Father, who becomes the king

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:42.070
so, it is benevolent King, is the Father

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.470
and that is what is on the right-hand side

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.580
left hand is the Spirit

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.510
spirit is the reflection of the God

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:04.320
aspect of God, which is the witness

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:18.480
which is the end of our existence  because it is existence

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.320
once the heart stops, we have no existence

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:37.480
so, it is also the destroyer, because when it stops, you are destroyed

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.410
when you will read Sahara Yoga, gradually you will know

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.120
different centres and different places

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:53.390
and what is the relationship of Spirit with God, with other things

00:18:53.450 --> 00:19:01.090
you will know, you can read it and verify it in yourself

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:22.760
this is when you enter into the new dimension of your awareness

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.990
where you feel the all-pervading power,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.160
then you can understand, because with that power

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.720
you know whether that, which centre is which

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.250
any conception that we accept

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.500
without knowing personally about it, is a conception

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.990
or hypothesis

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.650
whatever I am saying is a hypothesis to you!

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.970
but when you verify it, then it's a law

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.210
it's a divine law

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.510
so keep yourself open for that

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.950
because whatever is here, may not be truth!

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.410
how to believe it?

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.160
today people have reach that stage that they definitely say:

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.100
"why do you believe this, why?

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.020
why do you believe that Christ was crucified?

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.930
why do you believe the Immaculate Conception?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.540
why do you believe there is God?"

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.840
Now, you cannot show them Quran or Bible or Geeta

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.850
they will say: "why do you believe them also?"

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.080
because they are not connected with god

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.520
once the connection is established

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.100
you get all answers on your hands,  you can feel it

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:13.420
if you ask God: "is there God?"

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.720
the question, you start getting cool breeze in your hands

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.060
ask about false man: "is he true?"

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.680
you might even get burning

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:50.650
some are such horrid devils on this earth, that you can get blisters

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:12.440
now if supposing, in Germany, when Hitler came

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.990
people were realised, they would have known

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.860
that he is devil

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.450
they would not have followed him

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.320
and, if, say, at the time of Christ

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.130
if at the time of Christ

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.590
people were realised, they would not have crucified him

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:45.110
imagine they followed Hitler and crucified Christ

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:50.290
can you imagine, what happens to the brains of human beings?

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.540
so, one must have their absolute

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.610
so they can just [ UNCLEAR be] absolute

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.040
unless and until you have absolute, you can not change

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.210
that is reason, why they make such mistakes

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.610
see, that they followed Hitler and killed Christ

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.550
their interpretations: according to them was right

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.650
fine! they didn't know where they went.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.000
Unless and until you find your absolute

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.580
how will you judge anything on absolute value?

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.020
then you will have to go on compromising all the time

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:23.090
your principles and everything because you don't know what is right, what is wrong

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.720
modern time are really days of confusion

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:42.490
a real confusion, everybody is confused

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.770
only those who are realised people get over the confusion

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.540
what all I have to tell you, that you must be born.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:08.650
Again to have a value, it’s an actualisation, what is wrong is this?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.560
Christ only said these things, isn't it?

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:25.960
because he didn't find people who were realised souls, he was crucified

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.050
and even when he comes people will not recognise him

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.490
if they are not realised souls.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.280
Now, here are some children who are realised souls

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.870
immediately I knew they are realised souls

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.840
and the children also said: they are realised souls

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.350
because they are feeling cool breeze all the time.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:10.050
But how will you make it out unless you know it’s a realised soul or not? 

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.290
we have to open our eyes, isn't it?

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.290
whats wrong in that, I just don't understand?

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.740
it is the completion of what Christ has said

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.630
that you are to be born again

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.910
now, we have to prove that existence of Christ

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.090
and the existence of Mohammed, exictance of all these people

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:52.950
on some definite scientific awareness basis

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.480
on the central nervous system

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.740
the criticised will be always there, they have been always there

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.930
they criticised Christ, they criticised all great people

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.170
even Rousseau was criticised and tortured

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.960
they are always there

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.570
they are the nasty people

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.530
they always will be nasty people

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:53.100
they will never be able to see the right thing

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.280
and they do not also want to see that

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.850
others are also honest, who are getting Realisation

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.470
but because I am nasty fellow, I didn't get Realisation.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:14.010
So, why should we criticise?

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.560
or mabye, there mabye someone who is sick

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.300
who has got problems, who is complicated

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.280
doesn't matter to me

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.210
it is the work of living God

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.150
the living work of living God, not of their tics (?)

00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:00.710
and it should not shocked people who have been living with dead work

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:06.040
satisfied with dead work

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:14.590
I am not paid for it, I don't take any money

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.320
not that I don't need it

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.230
but Christ never took any money

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:24.960
did you ever hear that Christ took any money for his sermons?

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.770
He was poor carpenter.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.170
A son, a carpenter's son

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.110
and he lived like a poor carpenter

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.930
he didn't want to have big house

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:50.550
he had only two robes to cover

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.970
He was king because he did not need anything

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:13.340
now supposing he was born as king, what I would have lived like a king

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.650
with full detachment

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:29.060
what  I don't understand, those who do not want Realisation

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.170
should not become like dogs in the manger

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:37.790
and spoil the chances of others getting Realisation.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.990
the one who doesn't eat the grass

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:04.520
and all the time barks and doesn't allow the cows to eat the grass.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.150
He can't eat the grass, also

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.150
is very childish, the thing

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:20.520
and stupid to brand somebody as something.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.610
It is very good to say, you are Victorian, you are this, that

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.010
this is not the way you are going to solve the problem

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.700
That’s the way we took Christ, exactly.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.860
you see, you don't have to judge me

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.090
you better judge yourself

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.100
the time has come for that.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.610
alright, now we should try and get our Realisation

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.730
and then we should try and see why we don't get

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.980
and we should try to fix up with people who got it

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.690
now those who have got Realisation.
