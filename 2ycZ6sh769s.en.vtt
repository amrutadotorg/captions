WEBVTT

00:15.580 --> 00:18.060
I am told that some of you have come

00:18.110 --> 00:23.340
for the first time, for the program here

00:27.820 --> 00:32.640
now, for the people who have come for the first time

00:33.420 --> 00:36.070
they have to first get their realization

00:36.130 --> 00:39.740
that is very important.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.380
Now, today I am feeling the atmosphere

00:50.700 --> 00:55.640
today I think some of you have come from places

00:56.010 --> 00:59.620
who have been to the people

00:59.950 --> 01:02.300
who are doing black magic maybe

01:02.330 --> 01:04.330
or some sort of a thing like that

01:04.420 --> 01:09.980
or TSP or psychology, or to some false gurus. Some of you.

01:11.930 --> 01:13.310


01:32.060 --> 01:38.970
And also that there are people who are feeling guilty

01:39.890 --> 01:47.080
if you are feeling guilty, there is a catch on this finger

01:51.130 --> 01:57.780
but if you are caching from people

01:57.850 --> 02:01.150
who have been in black magic and fake gurus and all that

02:01.170 --> 02:07.570
then you catch on this finger and this thumb

02:17.990 --> 02:24.940
also, I  think there are people who already feeling the vibrations

02:29.790 --> 02:34.400
so we have people of all types

02:38.680 --> 02:42.950
I am happy you have brought your children

02:45.010 --> 02:49.370
because I am very happy with children

02:52.830 --> 02:57.600
there are many children born, who are realised souls

03:02.960 --> 03:06.500
And they don't understand human beings

03:06.520 --> 03:10.900
who do not have that level

03:14.310 --> 03:17.490
And that is a big problem

03:17.990 --> 03:21.770
Moreover when these children grow up more

03:22.010 --> 03:24.320
they take to new seeking

03:24.550 --> 03:28.400
in which they fall a trap to drugs or false gurus

03:28.420 --> 03:32.080
or some sort of a wrong thing

03:47.810 --> 03:55.540
If the children are not given the training or understanding of the all vibrations

03:55.610 --> 03:58.490
even if they are realised souls

03:58.590 --> 04:02.710
they can go astray

04:18.870 --> 04:24.230
in this modern time we cannot stop our children to go to wrong things

04:24.260 --> 04:27.970
it's impossible, because life is such

04:35.990 --> 04:38.230
to make them understand their value

04:38.220 --> 04:44.480
and understand why they are on this earth

04:44.570 --> 04:49.730
best is to give them Realisation if they are not realised at least

05:05.140 --> 05:05.810


05:05.820 --> 05:10.770
because they grow up, they get complicated, disappointed, frustrated

05:10.990 --> 05:14.460
and they commit suicide also

05:24.270 --> 05:30.950
so the interest of these children   which is progeny of our country

05:31.200 --> 05:35.420
we have to give them Realisation

05:45.990 --> 05:48.900
we are actually neglecting our children these days

05:48.920 --> 05:52.580
because we are very busy

05:56.560 --> 05:59.310
and children have so much time in hand

05:59.410 --> 06:03.800
that they don't know what to do with themselves

06:08.700 --> 06:13.830
once they get Realisation, they get very busy

06:21.950 --> 06:27.660
my granddaughter, who was hardly of four, five years of age

06:27.980 --> 06:30.410
when we went to the airport one day

06:30.430 --> 06:34.750
she was just going like this all the time

06:46.840 --> 06:49.150
because she is a born realised

06:49.150 --> 06:53.920
the mother asked her "what are you doing all the time like this?"

06:58.490 --> 07:03.630
She said: "I am trying to bind(?) all these people in the airport"

07:03.780 --> 07:10.560
they are very very loose and running amok and they are very speedy.

07:21.990 --> 07:25.420
like this, they go mad only.

07:29.010 --> 07:34.680
They behave like their grandmothers I can tell you!

07:40.540 --> 07:43.200
they understand sahaja yoga very well.

07:43.210 --> 07:47.640
The children who are born realised, takes no time to explain to them things.

07:47.640 --> 07:51.630
They understand it, relate to it

08:04.090 --> 08:06.130
and they understand me very well.

08:06.160 --> 08:11.000
Because I speak the same language as they do.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.100
I am sure in this great country also

08:18.150 --> 08:23.740
there must be many children many children who are born realised

08:30.230 --> 08:36.250
if the parents and the teachers and professors get Realisation,

08:36.440 --> 08:42.340
they will understand these great souls that are born on this Earth.

08:55.090 --> 08:57.190
They will understand their children

08:57.230 --> 09:03.400
and a beautiful rapport and relationship can be felt

09:17.560 --> 09:20.260
I have seen when children see my photograph

09:20.270 --> 09:26.350
they tell their parent: "You have to meet this Lady."

09:37.820 --> 09:43.690
Because they understand that there is something common between Her and us

09:50.940 --> 09:57.850
they are source of innocence for us and for the whole world.

10:03.810 --> 10:08.130
Innocence is holiness and auspiciousness.

10:16.230 --> 10:24.130
When we get our Realisation, our lost innocence is reestablished.

10:33.620 --> 10:40.750
We start enjoying world like a child enjoys it. It is fun.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.280
That is what Christ has said :

11:05.400 --> 11:12.350
"you have to be like children to enter into the kingdom of God"

11:18.840 --> 11:25.770
but today I find in the western countries especially children are attacked

11:26.150 --> 11:29.370
their innocence is attacked

11:40.480 --> 11:45.210
sometimes I feel that the countries where there is love for children

11:46.010 --> 11:47.970
children take their birth more

11:47.970 --> 11:53.870
that's why the birth rate is more in countries like India

12:20.970 --> 12:26.870
after Realisation you like to spend your time with children and enjoy their company

12:26.890 --> 12:32.890
because you enjoy their innocence as your innocence has been awakened

12:47.170 --> 12:55.270
I am very happy that today you have brought your children with you, thank you for that

13:02.860 --> 13:05.410
come along! come along!

13:07.390 --> 13:14.290
alright, so for today, those who have not got their Realisation

13:14.790 --> 13:19.500
we should see that they get their Realisation first

13:20.510 --> 13:24.970
then I would like to work individually on all of you

13:25.100 --> 13:30.880
to see that I establish the Realisation.

13:50.680 --> 13:54.770
Now, those who haven't got Realisation

13:55.810 --> 14:03.310
the sahaja yogis who are here will pay special attention.

14:14.280 --> 14:19.330
Now, those who have not had cool breeze in their hand, yesterday

14:19.910 --> 14:26.100
and today who have come for the first time, please raise your hands

14:38.920 --> 14:43.050
but you are feeling cool breeze alright, aren't you?

14:45.640 --> 14:46.890
she is born realised

14:46.920 --> 14:47.910
what about you people?

14:47.950 --> 14:51.020
are you feeling cool breeze in the hands?

14:52.360 --> 14:55.200
what about you?

14:57.250 --> 14:59.680
all born realised, they are all born realised

14:59.750 --> 15:01.740
see they have got it

15:01.820 --> 15:03.470
these children? are you feeling cool breeze in your hands?

15:03.490 --> 15:06.370
my children, yes, great !

15:07.810 --> 15:09.820
see, I told you, they don't need anything

15:10.060 --> 15:12.110
they are already feeling it, I knew, I could see

15:12.160 --> 15:16.570
and the little one there, are you feeling the cool breeze?

15:24.740 --> 15:27.200
they are going to have[unclear]

15:27.980 --> 15:29.320
what about little thing there?

15:29.340 --> 15:32.340
are you feeling cool breeze?

15:32.350 --> 15:35.120
yes, the next little one

15:35.120 --> 15:35.960
alright, he is feeling

15:35.980 --> 15:40.270
I told you, you have got more realised children

15:47.760 --> 15:51.080
alright, so now. yes?

15:51.570 --> 15:59.950
sahaja yogi: when I see you my heart it's much better

16:01.380 --> 16:05.890
Shri Mataji: put your right hand on your heart, right hand

16:06.660 --> 16:08.820
and then chanting has to be done

16:08.960 --> 16:11.240
that: "Mother I am the Spirit !" inside

16:11.800 --> 16:13.540
then the heart will be always be alright

16:13.570 --> 16:18.650
because in the heart resides the Spirit

16:37.850 --> 16:40.960
Shri Mataji: you too have a problem?

16:45.380 --> 16:52.530
Sahaji: he is saying that the spiritual heart is on the right

16:55.910 --> 16:59.600
Shri Mataji: no, on the left. Spiritual heart on the left

16:59.600 --> 17:04.470
on the right there is also, we believe in that also

17:04.480 --> 17:08.270
on the right, there is another centre

17:08.370 --> 17:10.540
which is the father's centre

17:10.560 --> 17:13.930
it is another aspect of God

17:14.030 --> 17:23.860
which is a Father, who is the Father, who becomes the king

17:35.530 --> 17:42.070
so, it is benevolent King, is the Father

17:44.790 --> 17:48.470
and that is what is on the right-hand side

17:50.790 --> 17:54.580
left hand is the Spirit

17:55.180 --> 17:59.510
spirit is the reflection of the God

17:59.530 --> 18:04.320
aspect of God, which is the witness

18:07.080 --> 18:18.480
which is the end of our existence  because it is existence

18:21.660 --> 18:27.320
once the heart stops, we have no existence

18:30.660 --> 18:37.480
so, it is also the destroyer, because when it stops, you are destroyed

18:41.270 --> 18:44.410
when you will read Sahara Yoga, gradually you will know

18:44.440 --> 18:48.120
different centres and different places

18:48.170 --> 18:53.390
and what is the relationship of Spirit with God, with other things

18:53.450 --> 19:01.090
you will know, you can read it and verify it in yourself

19:17.710 --> 19:22.760
this is when you enter into the new dimension of your awareness

19:22.750 --> 19:27.990
where you feel the all-pervading power,

19:28.020 --> 19:31.160
then you can understand, because with that power

19:31.300 --> 19:35.720
you know whether that, which centre is which

19:52.720 --> 19:57.250
any conception that we accept

19:59.000 --> 20:06.500
without knowing personally about it, is a conception

20:19.250 --> 20:21.990
or hypothesis

20:22.050 --> 20:26.650
whatever I am saying is a hypothesis to you!

20:29.570 --> 20:32.970
but when you verify it, then it's a law

20:33.090 --> 20:36.210
it's a divine law

20:42.760 --> 20:46.510
so keep yourself open for that

20:49.190 --> 20:52.950
because whatever is here, may not be truth!

20:53.570 --> 20:56.410
how to believe it?

21:01.430 --> 21:05.160
today people have reach that stage that they definitely say:

21:05.320 --> 21:09.100
"why do you believe this, why?

21:13.390 --> 21:16.020
why do you believe that Christ was crucified?

21:16.120 --> 21:18.930
why do you believe the Immaculate Conception?

21:19.000 --> 21:22.540
why do you believe there is God?"

21:29.000 --> 21:32.840
Now, you cannot show them Quran or Bible or Geeta

21:32.870 --> 21:36.850
they will say: "why do you believe them also?"

21:41.050 --> 21:44.080
because they are not connected with god

21:46.800 --> 21:49.520
once the connection is established

21:49.550 --> 21:53.100
you get all answers on your hands,  you can feel it

22:05.820 --> 22:13.420
if you ask God: "is there God?"

22:13.800 --> 22:19.720
the question, you start getting cool breeze in your hands

22:27.770 --> 22:31.060
ask about false man: "is he true?"

22:31.180 --> 22:34.680
you might even get burning

22:45.180 --> 22:50.650
some are such horrid devils on this earth, that you can get blisters

23:07.090 --> 23:12.440
now if supposing, in Germany, when Hitler came

23:12.460 --> 23:14.990
people were realised, they would have known

23:15.000 --> 23:17.860
that he is devil

23:28.230 --> 23:31.450
they would not have followed him

23:31.960 --> 23:36.320
and, if, say, at the time of Christ

23:37.240 --> 23:39.130
if at the time of Christ

23:39.130 --> 23:41.590
people were realised, they would not have crucified him

23:41.670 --> 23:45.110
imagine they followed Hitler and crucified Christ

23:45.160 --> 23:50.290
can you imagine, what happens to the brains of human beings?

24:10.340 --> 24:12.540
so, one must have their absolute

24:12.570 --> 24:16.610
so they can just [ UNCLEAR be] absolute

24:20.040 --> 24:24.040
unless and until you have absolute, you can not change

24:28.290 --> 24:31.210
that is reason, why they make such mistakes

24:31.210 --> 24:35.610
see, that they followed Hitler and killed Christ

24:45.040 --> 24:47.550
their interpretations: according to them was right

24:47.720 --> 24:50.650
fine! they didn't know where they went.

24:59.410 --> 25:02.000
Unless and until you find your absolute

25:02.360 --> 25:06.580
how will you judge anything on absolute value?

25:14.380 --> 25:17.020
then you will have to go on compromising all the time

25:17.050 --> 25:23.090
your principles and everything because you don't know what is right, what is wrong

25:33.840 --> 25:37.720
modern time are really days of confusion

25:38.250 --> 25:42.490
a real confusion, everybody is confused

25:47.840 --> 25:54.770
only those who are realised people get over the confusion

25:58.200 --> 26:01.540
what all I have to tell you, that you must be born.

26:02.150 --> 26:08.650
Again to have a value, it’s an actualisation, what is wrong is this?

26:13.900 --> 26:18.560
Christ only said these things, isn't it?

26:20.250 --> 26:25.960
because he didn't find people who were realised souls, he was crucified

26:29.080 --> 26:32.050
and even when he comes people will not recognise him

26:32.100 --> 26:35.490
if they are not realised souls.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.280
Now, here are some children who are realised souls

26:43.440 --> 26:46.870
immediately I knew they are realised souls

26:53.930 --> 26:57.840
and the children also said: they are realised souls

26:59.660 --> 27:03.350
because they are feeling cool breeze all the time.

27:04.270 --> 27:10.050
But how will you make it out unless you know it’s a realised soul or not? 

27:15.680 --> 27:19.290
we have to open our eyes, isn't it?

27:20.120 --> 27:23.290
whats wrong in that, I just don't understand?

27:24.020 --> 27:27.740
it is the completion of what Christ has said

27:27.760 --> 27:31.630
that you are to be born again

27:41.100 --> 27:43.910
now, we have to prove that existence of Christ

27:44.120 --> 27:47.090
and the existence of Mohammed, exictance of all these people

27:47.180 --> 27:52.950
on some definite scientific awareness basis

27:53.060 --> 27:57.480
on the central nervous system

28:13.740 --> 28:17.740
the criticised will be always there, they have been always there

28:17.910 --> 28:21.930
they criticised Christ, they criticised all great people

28:21.960 --> 28:24.170
even Rousseau was criticised and tortured

28:24.230 --> 28:25.960
they are always there

28:25.990 --> 28:27.570
they are the nasty people

28:27.630 --> 28:32.530
they always will be nasty people

28:46.510 --> 28:53.100
they will never be able to see the right thing

28:59.380 --> 29:01.280
and they do not also want to see that

29:01.300 --> 29:04.850
others are also honest, who are getting Realisation

29:05.150 --> 29:08.470
but because I am nasty fellow, I didn't get Realisation.

29:08.630 --> 29:14.010
So, why should we criticise?

29:23.600 --> 29:28.560
or mabye, there mabye someone who is sick

29:28.860 --> 29:31.300
who has got problems, who is complicated

29:31.540 --> 29:35.280
doesn't matter to me

29:44.630 --> 29:47.210
it is the work of living God

29:47.880 --> 29:52.150
the living work of living God, not of their tics (?)

29:56.310 --> 30:00.710
and it should not shocked people who have been living with dead work

30:01.170 --> 30:06.040
satisfied with dead work

30:10.190 --> 30:14.590
I am not paid for it, I don't take any money

30:14.730 --> 30:16.320
not that I don't need it

30:16.420 --> 30:18.230
but Christ never took any money

30:18.320 --> 30:24.960
did you ever hear that Christ took any money for his sermons?

30:35.880 --> 30:37.770
He was poor carpenter.

30:37.860 --> 30:40.170
A son, a carpenter's son

30:40.190 --> 30:43.110
and he lived like a poor carpenter

30:43.140 --> 30:44.930
he didn't want to have big house

30:45.760 --> 30:50.550
he had only two robes to cover

31:01.820 --> 31:06.970
He was king because he did not need anything

31:09.370 --> 31:13.340
now supposing he was born as king, what I would have lived like a king

31:13.370 --> 31:16.650
with full detachment

31:24.150 --> 31:29.060
what  I don't understand, those who do not want Realisation

31:29.090 --> 31:32.170
should not become like dogs in the manger

31:32.170 --> 31:37.790
and spoil the chances of others getting Realisation.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.990
the one who doesn't eat the grass

31:58.090 --> 32:04.520
and all the time barks and doesn't allow the cows to eat the grass.

32:05.100 --> 32:09.150
He can't eat the grass, also

32:13.360 --> 32:16.150
is very childish, the thing

32:16.710 --> 32:20.520
and stupid to brand somebody as something.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.610
It is very good to say, you are Victorian, you are this, that

32:24.710 --> 32:27.010
this is not the way you are going to solve the problem

32:27.140 --> 32:30.700
That’s the way we took Christ, exactly.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.860
you see, you don't have to judge me

32:42.960 --> 32:44.090
you better judge yourself

32:44.150 --> 32:48.100
the time has come for that.

33:00.850 --> 33:04.610
alright, now we should try and get our Realisation

33:04.820 --> 33:08.730
and then we should try and see why we don't get

33:08.860 --> 33:11.980
and we should try to fix up with people who got it

33:12.100 --> 33:16.690
now those who have got Realisation.
