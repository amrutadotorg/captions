00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.190
Guru Puja, July 12th, 1998

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:18.090
Today, we have assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.190
The word "guru" comes from

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.290
"the one which is magnetic,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.990
the person who is magnetic";

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:45.450
the one which attracts the attention of the seekers

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.940
is the guru. Also it means

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.290
the heaviness, or you can say,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.680
a person who is very steady,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:11.120
who is very deep, who has the knowledge,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.270
and who can act like the Mother Earth.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.140
For the power of magnetism in the Mother Earth

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.820
also is called as magnetic,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.260
but in Sanskrit is "Gurutwa karshan,"

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.580
means "the attraction

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.800
of the heaviness of the Mother Earth."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.290
But actually it is

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.010
a power of the Mother Earth that makes us stand

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.620
properly on our legs when it is rotating

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.140
with such a tremendous speed,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.570
otherwise we would be all thrown away.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.010
With that velocity that She is moving,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:26.270
we are still attached or we are one in our balance,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.940
is only because She has gravity.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.800
This gravity has to be in a guru.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.020
Gravity means

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.860
a kind of a serious understanding of oneself

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.530
and one's own responsibilities.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.810
So a guru has to be very steady.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.830
In these modern times, people are very mobile,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.440
all the time agitated,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.250
all the time getting disturbed.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.830
With small things happening here and there, they get disturbed.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.280
They meet people who are not of any quality,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.910
then they get disturbed.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.960
These disturbing qualities

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.440
come from our deficiency in our gravity.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.930
A person who has gravity doesn't get depressed,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.070
neither get excited,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.570
nor get overly enthusiastic,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.500
nor is he very sad or unhappy.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820
So he's in the center,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.190
he's in the center of his being.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.950
But how do we become the guru?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.430
That is very important for Sahaja Yogis to understand.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.730
Many have felt that they are gurus,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.550
they have tried to behave in a funny manner,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.720
and have lost their guru position.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.430
First and foremost thing for Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.230
it is important that they must have introspection,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.490
they must watch themselves.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.000
If a person runs about

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.940
changing because a fashion has come,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.080
because people have suppressed them, or have asked them;

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.440
just to please people of cheap values,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.210
if a person changes, then he cannot be a guru.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.330
He has to station himself

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.870
properly on the values of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.080
Without introspection you will not know,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.450
you will never remember what you have done wrong,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.000
nor will you think of what you have to do right.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.860
But that is only possible if you go on improving yourself.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.660
First and foremost thing is,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.120
all the great saints have praised their guru.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.850
For example, we have a very great saint,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.100
Gyaneshwara, in India.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.840
He's written a complete chapter about the guru.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.910
In English they have translated it as "preceptor" -

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.500
guru is the preceptor -

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.160
and what he has done is a great thing.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.230
He says you are not to challenge the guru,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.700
otherwise you can never become a guru;

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.330
for name's sake you might be, but you are not.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.480
Secondly, you can never misbehave.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.300
You can never be rude, arrogant,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.190
and you cannot show your temper to a guru.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.040
If that is so, that means you are not a guru,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:51.580
you are still on a very low level personality.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.560
It is very clearly said

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.400
that if you try to say against other gurus

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.540
who are real gurus, who are very high caliber,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.230
that also, then you are not a guru.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.530
But I would say that you all have got now vibrations,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.340
you all have got vibratory awareness.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.140
When you have vibratory awareness,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.040
you are capable of finding out about everyone.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.670
Now you need not talk about

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.470
your own understanding of a person,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.520
but try to face that person directly,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.980
and tell that person, "This is the problem,"

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.870
and ask him to change.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.890
But in Sahaja Yoga we have something more than other gurus had.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.950
Other gurus were very, very strict.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.060
They used to carry a stick in their hand, a big stick

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.950
which they would use for walking or for hitting their disciples.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.750
They used to hit their disciples in such a bad manner

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:18.050
that the disciple was literally frightened of the guru.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:24.300
I'll give you an example of a guru I came across.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.340
One fellow was there in India

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:36.080
who came to one of the ladies who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.180
and he said that "My guru has sent me word

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.830
that Adi Shakti's going to come and stay with you. Is it true?"

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.550
She said, "Yes, She's going to stay with me. So what?"

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.240
He said, "My guru has told me

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.190
that 'You go and request Her,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.160
and if She could come to our ashram.'"

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.430
She said, "I'll ask Mataji, I don't know."

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:16.820
This fellow came to a program and he saw Me, a housewife.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.260
He said, "This cannot be that Guru."

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:27.070
But when I came in, he saw, and when I did Self Realization,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.110
that everybody's Kundalini was awakened, he was so surprised

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.010
and he prostrated himself before Me.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.350
Now, his guru was living in Amarnath,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:49.690
is a very famous religious place in the Himalayas.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.240
And this fellow lived in a place called Ambarnath.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:00.970
So he asked Me, "Mother, will You come to my ashram?"

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.730
I said, "Why not?" Because these gurus in the ancient time

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.420
never used to leave their seat, they call takia -

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.960
means "the pillow" - they never left their takia.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.480
I said, "All right, I don't mind. I'll come to you,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.650
to your ashram."

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.870
So he's just keeping quiet all the while.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.940
So I went there, this guru fell at My Feet,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.400
and he was very, very respectful;

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.930
and then we came back home.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.360
So this fellow started telling Me, "If You don't tell my guru,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.550
I would like to tell You that I have got a very bad Agnya.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.010
Can You cure, Mother?" I said, "Why not? I will."

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.130
So I went back to this guru again, and I said,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.880
"Why didn't you cure his Agnya?"

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.770
He said, "Why? Why should I cure? Who cured my Agnya?

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.360
I worked out myself. I had to introspect, find out,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.450
and I cured my own Agnya, and why should I cure his Agnya?

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:13.170
Let him plod, let him work, let him get to this.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:19.760
Otherwise he will be a spoilt man."

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.200
I was quite surprised. And he said,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.550
"You do it because You are a Mother. You are nothing but love,

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.570
and that's why You are doing it, all this, for others.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:40.930
But not me! No guru will open the Agnya of his disciples."

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.360
I said, "Then why are you a guru?"

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:49.140
He said, "Because we have to guide them.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:11.160
And if they have their Agnya badly cut out,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.450
if their attention is not all right, I'm not bothered about it.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.530
It is their duty to introspect and find,

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.930
and climb the ladder which I've put before them.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.760
So I'm a guru, I can only give them the ladder to climb up.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.730
It is they who should work very hard,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.640
it is they who should introspect,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.430
it is they who should correct themselves.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.310
Why should I help them to such an extent

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.640
that you open their Agnya?"

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.440
I said, "All right, you allow Me to open his Agnya,

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.640
if you don't mind."

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.970
He said, "You are a Mother, do what You like;

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.710
I have nothing to say. If You want to do that,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.000
You'll spoil him, You'll spoil him.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.630
Let him do it on his own,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.390
otherwise You'll be spoiling him."

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.540
I said, "As you are also spoiling,

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.860
that you don't open anybody's Agnyas, yes?"

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.110
"But whatever position I've achieved is a permanent one."

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.290
So I opened his Agnya.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.030
Then this fellow, on his way he told Me that

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:29.500
his guru came back "and he put me hanging on a well.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.540
And he used to every time lower the rope

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:38.290
so I would go into the water. Ten times he did it."

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.360
But I said, "Why did he do such a cruel thing?"

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.470
He said, "Because he found me smoking a cigarette."

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.290
My goodness!

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.080
So I asked his guru, I said,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.600
"Why do you do such horrible things to your disciples?"

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.630
He said, "Otherwise, if you don't do like that

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.960
they will never rise, they'll never come up.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.350
You go on forgiving them and the more you forgive,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.890
the worse they become, and they will show no ascent at all.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.660
So you have to be very strict with them.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.680
Please don't spoil them all the time."

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.120
I was really surprised. How could he say so?

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.520
"You see," he said, "Mother, if you give everything free,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.570
you give them everything so easily,

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.790
they will never value their self-respect,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.650
they will never value their Self Realization."

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.040
I said, "It's not so. You have to give them a chance.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.910
You have to allow them to rise,

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:47.270
and to allow them to become something.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.630
Like Mother Earth, what She does,

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:55.620
She sprouts the seeds, then the trees come up.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.180
Then after that She gives them the fruits,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.290
and She sees that the fruits are ripened; all does She do."

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:11.320
But he said, "But they are not trees, You see, they're human beings,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.920
and they have freedom to become devils also."

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.240
I said, "All right, if there are devils, I can manage them.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.040
You just see how I can manage them. And if they are devils

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.190
they will remain devils, you cannot change them."

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.580
So he argued with Me,

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.050
and when he met Sahaja Yogis he asked them,

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.590
"How many of you are willing to give life for Shri Mataji?

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.530
Do you know what She has given you?" They said, "Yes, we do."

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.560
So they came to Me and told, "Mother,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.470
he wanted us to give life for You." I said,

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.560
"There's no necessity, it's not necessary;

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.190
because he used to ask his disciples, perhaps."

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:02.840
And then I met many like him who were very strict gurus,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.880
complete obedience was needed; complete humility,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.000
complete surrender was needed.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.980
A word against the guru was not tolerated,

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.350
but even you could not answer,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.850
you could not show any temper to a guru.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.950
Now I have met people who are like that sometimes,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.260
then I stopped talking to them, that's it.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.030
If they want to improve, they can improve;

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.100
they don't want to improve, you cannot force them to improve.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.540
But according to these gurus,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.740
there should be a great fear in their mind,

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.230
that they should be so frightened

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.730
that they should behave themselves.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.780
Now we expect so much from the guru,

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.120
that he's your father, mother,

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.180
he's a friend, everything to you.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.570
He is a pure person who just wants your ascent.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.080
He wants to look after you,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.680
he wants to guide you, wants to protect you,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.560
and takes you to the life of spirituality;

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.430
and this is the way a guru has to work out.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.830
But what is expected of the disciples is even much worse.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:33.690
The disciple has to be absolutely a pure person,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:40.780
he should have a pure desire to become a spiritual person.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.550
If he doesn't have this pure desire,

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.890
he has some other desires, then absolutely useless.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.380
Like some people come to Sahaja Yoga, I've seen it,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.260
they want to make a name out of themselves,

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.540
they become great masters of everything,

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.100
they want to dominate everything.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.720
That is not, that is not important.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.780
There are some people who try to make money in Sahaja Yoga:

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.560
a way of making money.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.990
That also absolutely wrong; and not only that,

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.100
but it's very low level,

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.580
that you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.870
Then there are people who just come here for some politics.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.510
They go on saying things here and saying things there.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:33.520
All these things are not going to give you any ascent whatsoever.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.780
You have come here only to achieve a

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:44.620
great life of spirituality, of becoming a guru.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.060
Now also this politics business is quite a lot,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:54.330
people try to enjoy the position of a leader,

00:18:54.530 --> 00:19:00.250
so they try to keep that position in a very special way.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.970
There's no need.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:08.370
If you are a leader because you are a great master,

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.920
you will remain. Nobody can challenge you,

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.420
nobody can dethrone you, and one should not get disturbed

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.870
with any such fear.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:24.150
Sahaja Yoga is a yoga in which fear doesn't play any part;

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.370
there's no fear, for you.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:32.290
Only thing for your ascent, it is necessary that you introspect.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.990
Try to find out, what have you been doing?

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:42.590
Are you an, absolutely a humble person?

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.200
Do you do whatever is told to you?

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:54.720
Supposing I tell somebody just go to, say, some place,

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.220
he may not go. He'll come and tell Me,

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.350
"Mother, You know, this happened, that happened" -

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.810
some excuse, he may not go.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.520
But that's not being good.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.020
If you have been told to go to that place,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.600
there must be some meaning and you have to go.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.940
You have to obey. If you are not obedient

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:20.360
then you cannot become a guru, because if you cannot obey,

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.830
how can others obey you?

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.460
This obedience is not for any personal gain of the guru,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.350
not at all, but for your gain only,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.090
for your education, for your ascent.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:39.220
So if such a view is taken then what happens,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:45.390
that you start getting all the qualities of a guru.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.870
Firstly, a guru cannot be fussy man,

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.510
first and foremost thing.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.290
"I want this house, I want that thing;

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.500
I can't like this, I can't like that."

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.150
If a person who does not know

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.860
how to get detached from all these habits,

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.830
he cannot be a guru. How can he ascend?

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.070
Of course, I mean, you have to try

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.720
that you get rid of all these habits.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.400
They are funny habits which make you miserable;

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.830
doesn't make miserable others, as it makes you miserable.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:28.620
No habit should cling to a guru.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:35.790
First and foremost is that he has to be beyond time.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.280
He should not worry about time.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.130
Many-a-times I have seen people,

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.600
if they have to go to a airport, for example,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.460
something enters into their body,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.250
they become speedy suddenly, everybody.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.150
Even if I have to go, I'm going,

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.680
then all of them will become speedy,

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.770
everybody starts running helter-skelter. Why?

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.850
I am going, you are not going; but it happens.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.500
Like that, if you tell somebody you have to go to a function

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.250
or for some felicitation, people start jumping about,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.600
and that's a very modern disease, it was not before.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.670
So they start seeing that we are getting late, getting upset.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.460
But if you go on worrying like that, you don't go beyond time.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.570
And when you go beyond time, you control time,

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:40.080
time is with you all the time. Whenever you go, it happens.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.750
I'll give an example of that.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.630
We had a little girl in Cabella who fell down

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.630
and she broke her hand, very badly.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.270
I was about to leave for America, I was,

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.740
actually I'd come out of My room.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.500
When I saw the child I said,

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.570
"All right, doesn't matter. I'll cure this child first."

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.450
They said, "No, Mother, but Your plane!"

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.380
I said, "It's all right, forget it."

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:14.430
So I got the child, treated the child, and she was all right.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:21.760
And after, I think, half-an-hour, I left, I left for the airport.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.340
And you'll be amazed to hear

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.720
that that aeroplane was out of order,

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.530
which was going to New York.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.310
So there's this plane is out of order. Then they said,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.540
"All right, You can go by another plane which goes to Washington,

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.580
with the same ticket." I said, "Very good idea, give Me that,"

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.510
and I went by that. So that I reached Washington,

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.990
which is a very, very nice airport to arrive,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.220
because there's no problem of customs,

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.490
there's no crowd, nothing.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.570
All people go to New York, I don't know why.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.090
They should all go to Washington, it's very surprising.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:08.270
I discovered for Myself, that I wished I had not gone

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.930
by that horrible plane to go to New York.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.250
Like that everything works out.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:22.140
And the time comes what is good for you.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.830
It is such a lot of experience of Mine which I can tell you,

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.920
that to worry about time itself is a headache.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.000
If you leave it to this divine power and believe in it,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.000
then everything works out for your good.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:49.900
And if it does not, you must know that it is your destiny,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.150
you must accept, you must learn to accept.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.600
Because whatever you have fixed up yourself

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.720
as something very great, is not.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:04.210
So what is the greatest thing you have to achieve? -

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.610
your detachment.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.280
Then you become gunateet:

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.430
means, as you know, we have three gunas within us.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:21.120
One is, they call is as sattwa guna, is the best.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:25.530
But there are two other gunas which are, as you know,

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.780
the left side and right side.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.290
Either you are a right-sided person or a left-sided person.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:40.590
These two gunas within us are of no importance.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.570
Supposing you are a right-sided person,

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.960
then what happens to you? You become over-active.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.670
Over- activity gives you fatigue,

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.180
gives you all kinds of diseases which you have seen,

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.740
and you have to cure right side.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.540
Such a person is extremely speedy,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.430
he cannot sit in one place for two minutes,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.070
all the time jumping,

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:10.730
and he creates problems for himself and his family.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.720
Then the left-sided person,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.400
which we call as the tamo guna -

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.010
the right-sided is rajo guna, and the left-sided

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:27.900
is the one which is tamo guna -

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:33.650
"tamo" means darkness, such a man is afraid of darkness,

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.020
darkness, everything he is afraid of.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:45.170
But he becomes a very intriguingly, very crooked person.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:50.220
He always tries to trouble people in a very crooked manner,

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.230
not openly, while the right-sided man is openly a Hitler.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.100
But this one, the second one, the one who is called as tamo guni,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.990
is the one tries to trouble others very much.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:10.250
Rajo guni has a opinion of his own about everything.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.760
When he is so much having his own opinion,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.470
he goes on forcing it on to other persons.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.970
But if you see his own life, he is in complete misery.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.330
He cannot carry on with people, he cannot talk to people,

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.950
and there's a very big gap between himself,

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.330
his Spirit and his being.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.510
The second type, the tamo gunis, are the ones

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.860
who end up with all kinds of diseases.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.600
Even the right-sided people get lots of diseases.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.440
But the left ones get it psychosomatic.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.830
Psychosomatic diseases are very dangerous

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.480
and not curable by human doctors.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.730
So you have to take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.380
But again you go to the right or to the left,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:06.400
again right, to the left. This is not a very good attitude,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.070
I think, towards life that you get bound by one of these gunas,

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.210
or you are all the time like a pendulum

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.210
moving from left to right, right to left.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.130
So you have to be a steady person.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.080
For that, you all have to meditate.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.640
I know immediately a person who meditates,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.930
and I know who does not meditate.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.130
You will yourself know a person who meditates.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.270
It's a question of ten, fifteen minutes,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.580
but that you must do every night and morning,

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.940
about five minutes' meditation; then you develop your balance,

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:52.280
you develop your tenacity, you develop your own body

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.490
in such a manner that it can stand lots of nonsense,

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:01.750
it can bear lots of things. You don't have then desires left -

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.060
what food you should eat, when you should eat,

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.010
whom you should please - nothing of the kind.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.160
You yourself become such a sweet person

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.520
that everybody is pleased, and understand that

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:23.340
one has to be like you.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.830
The people see you and you become like a model.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.400
People start following you, that means you become a guru.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.870
In this way you get rid of these two habits that you have,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.890
of left and right side. Now sattwa gunis are the people

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:45.730
who believe in the righteousness, but when they are righteous,

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.960
they have contempt for others who are not righteous.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.690
They go on saying things to such people,

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.020
so they can develop a kind of a temperament

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.100
so they become aloof. They can go to Himalayas,

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.630
sit there and not to meet anybody; get out of the society,

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.300
get out of all your relations, everyone,

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:14.090
and just establish yourself as a big guru somewhere.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.480
This kind of also another generation is there,

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:23.540
which is of no use. I met some of them when I was in Hardwar.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.810
And I told them, "What are you doing here in the Himalayas?"

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.130
They said, "We don't want to face human beings.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.110
They're useless people, they're good for nothing.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.370
You do anything for them, they go on troubling you.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.020
We don't want to be there." So I said, "Why have you become guru?

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.920
If you cannot manage them, if you cannot

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.660
get out of the troubles they are giving you

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.750
and out of all those things, and remain in your peace,

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.160
then what's the use of becoming this?"

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.220
He said, "We have had enough of it."

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.970
Some of them were over hundred years of age and all that,

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.160
but I said, "What's the use? Your life is of no use,

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.510
you are staying here alone somewhere in the jungles."

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.030
He said, "The tigers, the snakes, all of them know us,

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.900
that we are great; they don't trouble us.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.320
But these human beings are troubling.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.370
If we go down, they'll trouble us and torture us.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.980
We don't want to go there because they're very ambitious,

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.500
or they are very negative.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.810
Something is wrong with the human beings,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.460
none of them have reached a perfect state."

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.810
So that all that, I was surprised

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:39.730
how they are not at all willing to come down and be with us,

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.140
and be a part and parcel of us.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.880
So they said, "All right, Mother, You have come. You are a Mother,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.970
You can tolerate all this and You can work it out, but not me.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.820
We are out of it, we don't want to go back."

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.460
They have lots of powers. They can control the nature,

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.750
they can do so many things. But they said,

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:04.960
"Easy to control even a snake than to control a human being.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.780
Today they might behave in a particular manner,

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.750
suddenly they will become horrible.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.970
You don't know these human beings how uncertain they are,

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.320
what uncertain quantity they are."

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.530
I said, "There is a way of putting them right.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.850
You first give them Realization. In the light of their Spirit

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.330
they can see how they are doing wrong things.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:32.130
Ninety-nine percent people will know what's going wrong with them,

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.140
where are they missing the point.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.780
They will start seeing themselves.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.970
Spirit is like a mirror where you see yourself clearly,

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.200
and you start changing yourself.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.710
There's no introspection actually needed then,

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:52.190
when you have your Spirit awakened. You can watch yourself,

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.560
you can see for yourself clearly,

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.600
as soon as

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:05.910
you become a developed or evolved Sahaja Yogi."

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.800
And that is one point one should see,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.780
if it has happened to you.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.430
If you can see something wrong with you,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:24.950
if you can find out what sort of defects you have,

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:30.180
if you can detach yourself from those defects,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.150
and if you can understand

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.040
that all these attachments and defects and habits

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.640
are pulling you down, then only you can leave them.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.150
But that only happens when you have

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:49.700
this mirror of your Self shining through.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:53.670
When this light comes to you, you see for yourself

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.360
what is wrong with you,

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.910
what is the wrong path you are taking.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:04.410
Overnight you have seen people have given up so many things.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.620
Many gross things they give up, but still there are many,

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.510
I should say, subtle things, which stick on to them.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.900
First thing that happens to you is that you start finding

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:24.890
what's wrong with your own people of your own nation.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.940
I'm amazed, you see, when the English got Realization,

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.440
they started telling Me about the English.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.790
When Italians got Realization,

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.260
they started telling Me about the Italians.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.540
If you tell the Italians that "You see, this Italian fellow did this like that,"

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.570
he said, "Italians after all, Mother, what will they do?

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.020
They're just like this, You know." He himself is an Italian,

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.530
but immediately he'll say. Same with the Russians, I have seen,

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:55.610
it's very surprising that they start telling you

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.540
about what's wrong with the Russians or with the Ukrainians,

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:03.170
all of them are quite alike. Even Indians, they'll say,

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.820
"After all this is Indian. You know Indian people how they are,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.960
Mother; they are doing like this." I was surprised that

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.420
they themselves being Indians,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.260
how are they immediately telling Me about the Indians?

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:20.030
And many things I have come to know about these countries

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.460
through the, actually through the Sahaja Yogis only.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.710
When the Sahaja Yogis tell Me, I'm amazed

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.510
that they are not identified with their country,

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.790
they are not identified with anyone,

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.630
even their own family they are not identified with.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.100
If they find something wrong, they'll tell Me,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.300
"Mother, my father is like that, my mother is like that."

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.590
That is how you get detached,

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.590
when you start seeing and not identified.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:50.510
If you are not identified with all these things,

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:55.470
then you become a free person, you have the freedom.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.510
You become a person who is not attached to anyone

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.050
because he's your father or she's your mother,

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.450
or a sister or anyone.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:11.080
This attachment is a very dangerous one also.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.810
With the family attachment, we have lost many Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.990
Because their family was funny, they got lost;

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.940
they couldn't get out of it.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.500
We don't say that you detach yourself from family or get out of it,

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.330
but in a subtle way you should understand what are they up to,

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.820
and what they are doing. All these subtle understanding

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:39.250
about everyone doesn't give you any right also to criticize them.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.070
You should see for yourself what's wrong with you.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.590
You know all these subtleties you criticize,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.410
that such a person is such, such a person is such,

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.610
but you also have the same problems with you.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:57.530
That's why you get detachment only possibly,

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:02.600
through this introspection through the mirror of your Spirit.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.670
So the spiritual life is very important to a person

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.180
than anything else on this earth,

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.070
because such a person has been seeking,

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.290
he has been seeking the truth, he has been seeking the reality.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:22.210
And once you know the reality, you don't want to cling onto

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.500
something which is not reality.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:30.250
You want to be a person who is above all these things,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.230
that you can see all these things.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.510
And that is how you can save others

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:41.580
who are getting drowned into the ocean of darkness,

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.890
into the ocean of misidentification,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.820
only when you are above these things.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:54.010
But mostly what happens is this, that you are identified,

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:58.390
you are identified, "How can I do it? How can I say?"

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.700
The countries where Sahaja Yoga has spread,

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:06.050
where there have been people who are not identified with those countries,

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.870
and think that they have to help

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:13.540
all these countrymen to come up, to join them.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:18.890
For that, tremendous patience and love is necessary.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.680
As you know this cosmic power, as they call it,

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.560
which they say I'm the source: actually, it is the power of love,

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.240
of divine love, of pure love.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.990
And such a love doesn't demand anything, doesn't want anything,

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.710
but it acts, it works.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:42.050
For example, if you love somebody, you would not like to do

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.980
something to displease that person.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.170
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:52.180
who do things which I really don't like,

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.310
but I never show, I just keep quiet.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:00.210
But normally if a person has love for someone,

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.780
he wouldn't do anything to displease

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:08.400
or to trouble that person, or in any way hurt.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.250
Without that development within you,

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.770
you cannot become collective.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:20.180
In collectivity what happens that you feel for others,

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.240
you understand others. You may not show off,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.090
but you do, inside yourself you know.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.380
Supposing somebody has done lots of funny things with you,

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:34.430
doesn't matter. But gradually you will see he will change,

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.950
gradually he will become better, because he'll realize that

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.910
whatever he has been doing has not been a correct thing to do.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.920
He will not only feel guilty, that's not the way, but he will say,

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.170
"I should correct. Why did I do like this? I should not have done."

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.010
Gradually he will improve, but for that you should have

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.620
a great sense of forgiveness,

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.470
great sense of understanding.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.980
Under circumstances, people also misbehave.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.960
Because they've had no training how to be all right,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.600
how to be humble, they misbehave.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.490
Because in their culture perhaps, there is nothing but just anger,

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.170
and arrogance is regarded as something great,

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.100
also they misbehave. Sometimes they come from such families

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.640
where only arrogance is taught, so you can't help it.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.860
Such people are to be forgiven again and again,

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.030
and see that they change.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:40.180
Because I have a faith that all human beings

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.390
can be made into beautiful flowers of fragrance -

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:49.890
all the human beings. But I know there are some difficult ones.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.610
Why? Because they don't want. If they don't want,

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.400
if they don't have the pure desire, you cannot force it on them.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.090
So forget it, they are difficult people, forget about them.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:09.460
But those who want, those who have a great desire

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.590
which is absolutely pure desire -

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:17.580
not for money, not for position, not for anything else,

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:23.870
but for achieving a great state of spirituality -

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.670
such people are to be helped at any cost.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:32.020
I know some of them have gone to very wrong gurus and they have suffered;

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.340
they have a bad Agnya, they have all kinds of things.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.450
Doesn't matter, you should try to help them.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.120
If they can listen to you, if they can understand

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.710
what you are telling them, I'm sure it will work out.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.930
It is worked out so much, as you can see now

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.660
that in the foreign countries where I was just an Indian,

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.000
how people have taken to it; how they have understood Me,

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.890
and how they have become Sahaja Yogis

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.620
of such a great value and level.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.940
We never had so many saints in the olden days, never.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.770
Only one saint would be born and he would be tortured.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.370
There were not so many to help each other

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.630
and to protect each other.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.630
So collectivity is to be learned very well:

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.890
how to be collective, how to be nice to each other;

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:28.050
because later on when you become the guru,

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:32.590
when you have to guide the people,

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.960
you will know what are the problems of the collectivity are.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:40.510
Also you will know how to overcome that,

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.980
how to make collectivity perfect.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.960
And once you learn that thing, you'll be amazed

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:53.710
that you have mastered the art of being a guru.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:59.000
I would like to see so many of you becoming a real guru,

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.500
real masters; not only in your jobs, in your talents,

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:09.040
but in your own life.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.670
People should say that such and such person is a real guru.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:17.920
For that, as I said, you must learn obedience,

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.550
complete obedience. You should not question the guru.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.320
Whatever is told to you, you must do;

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.700
though in Sahaja Yoga I do not say that.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.950
Today is the first time I am saying it,

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.150
because I find so many of you

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:35.720
fall a little short of becoming perfect.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.760
You don't have to sacrifice anything, I have told you,

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.250
you don't have to give up anything.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.930
You don't have to give up your families or anything,

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:49.030
and do odd things just to show that you are perfect.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.440
But it's something, a state within yourself

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.640
which you have to establish, where you become extremely humble,

00:43:55.850 --> 00:44:00.390
obedient, and you'll be glowing with this light, I am sure.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.430
Once you understand the importance, then

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.940
you will dedicate yourself to become

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.750
a personality of a real quality.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.580
It's very difficult, as people something say,

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.950
but I think the easiest thing to be,

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:23.020
because that's the most comfortable way of living in life -

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:27.420
no use fighting, no use quarreling, nobody trying to show off,

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.310
and all that. The care of everyone,

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.060
the suggestion of care,

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:40.200
is very much satisfying for others.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.400
A little care here and there, people like it.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.890
And that only comes from a very noble soul

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.770
who bothers about small, small things,

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.520
about whatever others need. It's not for your own advancement,

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.570
it's not for your own sort of leadership, whatever you may call,

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:04.940
or for your own positions - then you are falling short -

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:08.200
but it's for your own ascent,

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:14.880
for your higher life that you give up

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:20.630
all these ideas of leadership and this and that.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:26.740
Is absurd the way sometimes I find some Sahaja Yogis

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:34.980
are so anxious to assert themselves as leaders; it's not correct.

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:38.390
So many times I have explained to you

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:43.230
that your own development, your own correction,

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:50.570
your own position in Sahaja Yoga will say what you are.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.740
Whatever others may say doesn't matter.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.950
What you say about yourself truly, truthfully, is the reality,

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.600
and you must face yourself all the time.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.950
I would say, specially for the ladies,

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:08.780
that I'm a woman and I have worked very hard all these years,

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:15.970
and as a woman I must tell you that all the ladies should try;

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.810
because they always say "We are shaktis,"

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.770
but in their life I don't see there's any work done as shaktis,

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:28.370
only their sort of dependence all the time on Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.620
They have to stand up in their own freedom,

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.270
they have to be independent,

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:37.900
and they should have right ideas about everything.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.200
I'm sure if the ladies come up that way,

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.430
Sahaja Yoga will spread very much.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.270
Men are working much more for Sahaja Yoga than women are.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.580
I can understand because they have families,

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.890
they have children, this thing.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.050
But the most important thing is that

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.450
once you take to active Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.730
then your children also come up well,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.880
the family is also looked after.

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:08.810
After all, there is this divine power which looks after all of you.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:13.300
You must believe that this pure divine power thinks,

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:19.530
understands, it organizes; above all, it loves you.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:23.690
This divine power has to be understood that

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.710
it is now your own

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:31.030
and that you are in the realm of this divine power,

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.350
where you won't have any problems whatsoever.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:39.560
If you leave things to the divine power, it will all work out.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.310
As you know about this scientist who found out about Me.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:48.060
I have to just say that he asked Me that

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.950
"How is it this so many hearts are made here?"

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:55.890
I said, "It's people who are singing the song,

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.280
'Sitting in the Heart of the Universe.'

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.060
So this many hearts have come up."

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:05.290
But he said, "Still, does this power hear?"

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:10.160
I said, "No, it's Me only, I can hear.

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:16.550
I was hearing the song, and then the power organizes everything."

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.160
It's something to be understood very well

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:25.290
that the power within you, what you have, understands,

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:28.450
and understand you also.

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:33.920
It is a way of power which is your own power,

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.010
but you cannot control it.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.900
It knows about you. Whenever you are falling,

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.210
when you are doing wrong, the same power which protects you

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:47.350
and loves you like a mother,

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:51.830
will correct you and bring you to the right path.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.790
I think now a new century is starting

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:58.050
and so many things have to happen,

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:02.660
and all of you must decide that you'll do this or that.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:08.880
Whatever is your understanding is about spreading Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.960
you should try to; all of you should put your mind to it.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.050
If women can't go out they can write down something,

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:21.220
they can write about their spiritual ascent

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:26.240
or about whatever their experiences are.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.330
So in any case all those who have got also

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.410
very miraculous photographs, they should send it over here.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:37.330
Very important is, because this gentleman is coming here in September,

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.820
and he's going to analyze all of them.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.610
So it would be very nice of you if you can send it.

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:48.580
Also you write down about your different experiences

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.350
you have had in Sahaja Yoga: that would be also a good idea.

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:56.180
He told Me that he would like to publish a book like that;

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.620
and now the time has come for us to publish

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.900
our miracles that have taken place.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.060
All of you have had some experience of the miracle.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:10.000
So I have to request you to send you, as soon as possible,

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:15.040
written well in English language or in Hindi language or Marathi,

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.820
because I don't understand other languages.

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.000
And please don't send Me in other languages,

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:23.650
we'll have to appoint somebody to translate them in fourteen languages,

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:28.220
it's a difficult thing. So I would request you to send that.

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.710
I am sure today's lecture, you will again go through it

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:34.690
and understand it, and work it out.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:39.600
May God bless you.
