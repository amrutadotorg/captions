WEBVTT

00:03.375 --> 00:07.289
Today we are here to worship

00:10.236 --> 00:13.416
the resurrection of Christ.

00:17.283 --> 00:22.384
And also to thank Him

00:23.548 --> 00:27.383
for giving us

00:31.906 --> 00:36.883
an ideal life of a saint

00:38.695 --> 00:42.398
who has to work

00:42.882 --> 00:46.218
for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:51.454 --> 00:54.701
We talk of Christ,

00:55.592 --> 00:58.623
we sing of Shri Ganesha,

01:03.283 --> 01:06.366
we say we believe in Him,

01:07.142 --> 01:13.107
specially Sahaj Yogis feel He is the eldest brother that they have,

01:17.682 --> 01:21.425
and a tremendous

01:28.903 --> 01:34.293
surrender I find, among Western Sahaj Yogis specially, for Christ.

01:36.434 --> 01:39.250
Because they were born in Christian religion perhaps, maybe,

01:39.451 --> 01:44.493
or maybe that they found Christ’s life

01:45.383 --> 01:48.399
a very special one.

01:50.171 --> 01:55.537
But to Sahaj Yoga He has to be much more than that,

01:56.990 --> 02:00.177
and to you Sahaj Yogis.

02:00.662 --> 02:05.216
Many people believe in many deities.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.204
Like some believe in Shri Krishna, some in Shri Rama,

02:09.405 --> 02:14.240
some in Buddha, some in Mahavira and some in Christ.

02:14.655 --> 02:18.475
All over the world they do believe

02:18.803 --> 02:23.092
in some higher being.

02:25.012 --> 02:30.770
But this belief is without the connection, to begin with,

02:33.644 --> 02:39.167
and becomes a kind of a

02:39.440 --> 02:45.400
falsehood that they think that

02:46.119 --> 02:48.658
Christ belongs to them, Rama belongs to them

02:48.869 --> 02:51.816
or Shri Krishna belongs to them.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.977
That they are the possessors of all these deities

02:56.178 --> 03:01.251
because they have obliged of believing into it.

03:05.270 --> 03:09.121
And that is how most of the faiths have come.

03:09.379 --> 03:12.611
And though they ardently believe in Christ,

03:12.996 --> 03:17.142
all these faiths have failed.

03:17.934 --> 03:20.850
Because when they believed in Christ, they believed that

03:21.051 --> 03:26.786
through Christ they can get their cheques cashed.

03:27.552 --> 03:29.927
It was like a bank.

03:30.192 --> 03:32.743
You pray to God: "You get me all right."  All right.

03:32.943 --> 03:34.809
Then: "Get my mother all right,

03:35.010 --> 03:37.495
my father all right, my sister all right."

03:37.695 --> 03:42.335
"Get me so much money! Get me so much wealth!",

03:42.589 --> 03:45.850
or health or anything.

03:47.116 --> 03:51.999
Thinking that because we believe in Christ He’s so obliged

03:52.405 --> 03:57.498
that He has to pay for it and He has to look after us

03:58.792 --> 04:03.034
and that we are

04:03.323 --> 04:09.156
rightful possessors of His blessings.

04:09.730 --> 04:14.729
Then they form churches, temples, mosques, clubs,

04:15.082 --> 04:19.305
believing that, “Now we belong to Christ!

04:19.609 --> 04:22.987
All this group is a very special chosen one!”,

04:23.242 --> 04:27.789
or, “We belong to Rama,”

04:28.023 --> 04:32.121
or to Krishna or to someone like that.

04:32.879 --> 04:35.728
And to whomsoever they may ‘belong,’

04:35.996 --> 04:41.058
the one to whom they belong, does not know anything about them!

04:41.823 --> 04:44.044
Christ has said, “You’ll be calling me, 'Christ, Christ,’

04:44.245 --> 04:46.285
I won’t recognise you!”

04:46.510 --> 04:52.101
It’s a big warning to people who say, “We believe in Christ.”

04:55.109 --> 04:59.156
So, without the connection, if you believe in someone,

05:00.789 --> 05:02.785
it has no meaning.

05:03.390 --> 05:09.098
It’s just like some sort of a mythical, romantic idea

05:09.395 --> 05:13.038
that the other person whom you believe in

05:13.320 --> 05:18.078
has a special relationship with you.

05:22.046 --> 05:25.212
So this assurance that, “I believe into something,”

05:25.412 --> 05:28.953
or this assumption that, “I believe into something,

05:29.227 --> 05:32.842
and because I believe into something, I have every right

05:33.042 --> 05:36.173
to get all the blessings that I ask for,”

05:36.415 --> 05:40.634
is a myth, as you must have realised after Sahaj Yoga.

05:41.696 --> 05:44.480
But when you become a Sahaj Yogi,

05:44.909 --> 05:48.930
then you have got your connection with all of them

05:49.130 --> 05:51.587
and with Christ.

05:54.979 --> 05:59.354
But this connection again, in a subtle way, is the same style.

05:59.877 --> 06:04.342
For example, what we try to do is to ask again

06:04.542 --> 06:08.291
that this should be done, that should be done.

06:11.353 --> 06:15.759
“My Agnya is caught up. Mother, please clear it out!”,

06:16.541 --> 06:18.868
or

06:19.768 --> 06:24.300
“I’ve got headache so please put it right!”

06:25.405 --> 06:28.250
Because you believe in Sahaj Yoga, you expect Sahaj Yoga

06:28.451 --> 06:30.928
to feel obliged that, “See now, they believe in me,

06:31.170 --> 06:34.475
it’s such a great obligation!”

06:34.686 --> 06:37.331
“So Sahaj Yoga must do something for me!”

06:37.604 --> 06:41.651
Whether you do anything for Sahaj Yoga is not important.

06:42.323 --> 06:45.073
Only because you believe in Sahaj Yoga,

06:45.458 --> 06:47.887
because Sahaj Yoga has given you Realisation,

06:48.087 --> 06:51.467
so Sahaj Yoga has every obligation

06:51.667 --> 06:54.208
that it should look after you.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.716
“I am in Sahaj Yoga still, why should I suffer?

06:57.916 --> 07:01.835
I am in Sahaj Yoga, why should my mother not be all right?”

07:02.150 --> 07:04.103
“I am in Sahaj Yoga…”

07:04.755 --> 07:07.333
As if sort of an

07:08.661 --> 07:11.335
organisation where you have paid money or something

07:11.536 --> 07:15.192
and you are supposed to get all the rewards.

07:29.711 --> 07:31.656
But now, let us see,

07:32.007 --> 07:37.187
after Sahaj Yoga, what should be our attitude which is sane?

07:39.070 --> 07:44.718
The first is that, “Now I’m a Sahaj Yogi

07:45.724 --> 07:50.120
and now I’m connected to Christ.

07:52.659 --> 07:57.753
So what is my responsibility?”

08:01.350 --> 08:05.979
Christ felt responsible for the whole world!

08:06.611 --> 08:08.736
He’s described in the Devi Purana

08:08.947 --> 08:12.571
as the support of the whole universe.

08:14.392 --> 08:17.772
As soon as you are connected with Christ,

08:18.084 --> 08:21.701
the whole attitude has to change.

08:24.498 --> 08:28.425
So to be connected with Christ means,

08:28.654 --> 08:34.544
what are the qualities of Christ you have imbibed within yourself?

08:34.872 --> 08:38.278
That’s the minimum of minimum.

08:39.408 --> 08:43.792
What did you get out of His life?

08:47.579 --> 08:53.540
Is it that He has cured people, all right, so you should get cured?

08:55.005 --> 08:59.795
He gave eyes to people, so you must get your eyes back?

09:00.967 --> 09:04.006
Shri Mataji: Do you mind removing this for me?

09:09.093 --> 09:14.026
Or is it that His life,

09:14.796 --> 09:18.132
which you have enshrined,

09:18.524 --> 09:21.892
should also make you something

09:22.110 --> 09:25.438
that could be enshrined,

09:26.032 --> 09:29.056
that could be respected,

09:30.036 --> 09:36.011
that could be called as a reflection of Christ’s life?

09:38.222 --> 09:42.349
Now let us see His life, what kind of a life He led.

09:43.536 --> 09:47.882
We read Bible, I mean we carry Bible everywhere

09:48.143 --> 09:52.860
and even I saw the Bible in the hotel as if

09:53.183 --> 09:57.800
it’s a part of the thing, like a soap is kept and Bible is!

10:01.662 --> 10:05.583
Of course, I read it, I don’t know how many read it.

10:07.794 --> 10:11.716
But then it doesn’t become

10:14.715 --> 10:17.949
to say you are a Sahaj Yogi,

10:18.220 --> 10:20.944
if through His connection

10:21.144 --> 10:24.162
you have not received any one of His qualities.

10:24.362 --> 10:27.056
For example, this is now connected to the mains,

10:27.256 --> 10:29.495
so you are getting electricity through it.

10:29.695 --> 10:35.041
This doesn’t give electricity to the mains, but it receives.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.996
So you have to receive something from Him

10:41.584 --> 10:43.855
and what you have to receive

10:44.067 --> 10:48.722
is the qualities that He had.

10:53.204 --> 10:57.298
You might say, "Because, Mother, He was Divine,

10:59.989 --> 11:03.130
He was the son of God.”

11:05.645 --> 11:08.403
But He was also a son of His Mother

11:08.677 --> 11:12.641
and you are also son of your Mother.

11:15.398 --> 11:19.258
So mediocrity in our character

11:21.168 --> 11:23.004
cannot say that we are connected with Christ

11:23.205 --> 11:26.541
because there’s no energy of Christ flowing in you.

11:26.769 --> 11:31.752
When energy of Christ flows through you, you express it.

11:32.057 --> 11:34.377
Like yesterday the gentleman was playing

11:34.577 --> 11:39.191
and I think the power of Saraswati started flowing in him

11:39.440 --> 11:41.000
and how beautiful he played!

11:41.221 --> 11:43.025
He couldn’t control his fingers.

11:43.225 --> 11:47.314
He said, “It’s all happening here: I don’t know how!”

11:51.710 --> 11:55.233
So throughout, if you see His life,

11:57.374 --> 12:01.592
He was a person

12:03.070 --> 12:08.707
who was all the time bothered about the benevolence of the world.

12:11.242 --> 12:16.984
How clearly He went and talked to the priests

12:18.046 --> 12:20.881
and told them

12:21.213 --> 12:25.869
that, “You don’t understand me because you are blind.”

12:27.633 --> 12:32.201
He told them that He knows His Father

12:32.401 --> 12:34.440
and His Father knows Him,

12:34.792 --> 12:39.722
“But you do not know me, nor you know your Father.”

12:40.902 --> 12:46.071
So openly, blatantly, He was talking.

12:48.871 --> 12:54.806
He was not afraid that He will go to jail.

12:56.324 --> 12:59.548
He was not afraid that, by saying such a thing,

12:59.757 --> 13:02.241
the ego of others will be challenged;

13:02.482 --> 13:07.452
because He was not pretentious.

13:07.804 --> 13:10.664
He was not doing something that was not truthful.

13:11.523 --> 13:16.249
He was telling the truth and truth has that capacity

13:16.812 --> 13:20.149
to express itself through your personality.

13:22.336 --> 13:26.128
But do we really believe in ourselves?

13:28.410 --> 13:31.738
Do we really believe that we are Sahaj Yogis,

13:34.377 --> 13:39.511
that we can talk to people as Christ could talk to them?

13:41.111 --> 13:43.150
At a very young age of twelve years,

13:43.350 --> 13:46.485
He could go and talk to the priests.

13:46.721 --> 13:49.412
What courage!

13:49.639 --> 13:52.646
There was no need for Him.

13:52.983 --> 13:57.764
He should have really got married like Sahaj Yogis do

13:57.975 --> 14:02.397
and settled down with His wife and children nicely.

14:03.294 --> 14:08.527
Because the main headache for Sahaj Yogis seems to be the marriage

14:08.916 --> 14:12.765
and their children! He never married.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.407
He was so precious

14:18.673 --> 14:21.618
that He didn’t want to waste His time with these things.

14:21.939 --> 14:26.237
And He died so young, He knew that He had to die.

14:29.064 --> 14:33.678
So in His life, you see He was not a mundane type of a personality,

14:33.878 --> 14:37.732
not mundane, not ordinary.

14:41.970 --> 14:45.720
And when He spoke with such confidence, with such

14:46.087 --> 14:50.503
knowledge of truth that people did believe Him, had to believe.

14:50.704 --> 14:52.978
They couldn’t help it.

14:53.272 --> 14:57.955
This power you too have, and you can do the same.

14:58.916 --> 15:02.333
But the way He used His power,

15:04.439 --> 15:05.706
why can’t we use?

15:05.906 --> 15:09.084
Because we are not intense about it.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.950
Our attention is on something else,

15:15.338 --> 15:18.900
which is quite frivolous, which is useless.

15:19.224 --> 15:22.317
All right, we are Sahaj Yogis,

15:23.086 --> 15:26.052
so what do we think about?

15:26.578 --> 15:31.247
First thing we’ll think, “Now, today’s a puja, what should I wear?”

15:33.508 --> 15:35.992
Then, "I haven’t yet pressed my clothes," or

15:36.195 --> 15:41.003
"My sari’s not all right. I have to match it, and how to dress up."

15:41.617 --> 15:47.468
All these frivolous things first come to our brain.

15:47.671 --> 15:51.530
Or in the morning, when you get up in your ashrams or anywhere,

15:53.506 --> 15:56.613
what do you think?

15:58.454 --> 16:01.469
If it was Christ,

16:02.242 --> 16:06.403
He would say, “I am sleeping still?

16:07.137 --> 16:10.047
I have to meditate!

16:10.281 --> 16:15.684
I have to be one with the Divine!”

16:16.254 --> 16:19.462
He would not say, “No, no, the Divine will look after, it’s all right.

16:19.662 --> 16:22.917
The Divine will meditate for me!”

16:24.456 --> 16:27.017
“After all, Paramchaitanya, it has to meditate.

16:27.217 --> 16:31.319
Why should we meditate? We are all Sahaj Yogis.”

16:32.624 --> 16:36.087
“Everything is sahaj, so let the Divine meditate for us!”

16:36.288 --> 16:40.147
“We can’t get up in the morning. It’s difficult.

16:40.378 --> 16:44.189
We can’t, you see, just can’t.”

16:46.314 --> 16:48.970
But then you can’t be a Sahaj Yogi!

16:49.278 --> 16:51.868
You are supposed to be connected with all the deities,

16:52.069 --> 16:54.811
not only Christ.

16:55.163 --> 17:01.086
And here you can’t even get out of your bed - to meditate.

17:03.966 --> 17:06.108
While all the deities are already up there,

17:06.309 --> 17:10.005
waiting for you to get up, that’s all.

17:12.478 --> 17:17.898
And they can’t understand what’s happening to these Sahaj Yogis.

17:19.095 --> 17:21.790
“How can they be so low?

17:22.135 --> 17:24.293
After all, Mother must have given them Realisation

17:24.494 --> 17:26.587
thinking them to be something great.

17:26.806 --> 17:30.038
How did they get Realisation?

17:30.582 --> 17:34.550
They’re so ordinary, so mundane, so useless!”

17:35.410 --> 17:38.222
The deities start wondering,

17:38.422 --> 17:41.882
“Why Mother gave them Realisation?”

17:43.187 --> 17:47.007
Because a person, who cannot enjoy his meditation,

17:47.218 --> 17:50.397
cannot be a Sahaj Yogi.

17:53.429 --> 17:56.971
That’s the first sign of a Sahaj Yogi,

17:57.190 --> 18:02.651
that he looks forward to that time when he can meditate.

18:10.854 --> 18:15.081
That is the time you are really in connection with the Divine

18:15.282 --> 18:16.717
and you enjoy the most.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.280
Whenever I get a chance, I go into it.

18:19.481 --> 18:21.954
I find it so difficult to come out of it!

18:22.180 --> 18:24.674
I mean, for today it happened to me,

18:24.875 --> 18:30.445
I was first thinking that I will have to struggle out for this puja.

18:33.604 --> 18:35.674
I’ll have to work it out.

18:38.269 --> 18:42.300
I don’t know how I will get out of this meditative mood.

18:45.321 --> 18:48.671
But it surprises so many people,

18:58.666 --> 19:03.930
how people are meditating.

19:06.469 --> 19:08.377
Especially so many Indians told me this thing.

19:08.578 --> 19:11.492
It’s something very surprising,

19:11.976 --> 19:15.090
that they are supposed to be meditating and immediately they get up,

19:15.290 --> 19:19.016
“What cakes? What things? What have you cooked?” this, that.

19:19.297 --> 19:24.343
There’s no slumber of

19:24.719 --> 19:30.628
meditation in them and, just, they just start thinking about food.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.464
How can that be?

19:36.026 --> 19:39.416
It’s the way you cannot get out of your sleep,

19:39.617 --> 19:43.959
in the same way a Sahaj Yogi cannot get out of his meditative mood.

19:44.182 --> 19:47.437
It’s so enjoyable.

19:47.698 --> 19:50.866
You want to be there.

19:51.073 --> 19:54.825
So one of the signs that you are not yet anywhere near Sahaj Yoga

19:55.026 --> 20:00.129
is that if you cannot enjoy your meditation.

20:05.482 --> 20:08.201
I mean, imagine

20:08.584 --> 20:11.585
if you enjoy a television show or anything,

20:11.832 --> 20:15.129
you have to see it, isn’t it?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.982
You cannot just say, “All right, I’m sleeping now

20:20.182 --> 20:23.518
and I am enjoying the television.”

20:24.083 --> 20:29.216
So you have to be awakened to it but that awakening is within,

20:29.444 --> 20:35.186
and there you see your own connection.

20:36.224 --> 20:39.308
It’s a joy that I cannot describe really.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.624
There’s only one word for that, is nirananda,

20:41.825 --> 20:46.226
means it’s just, 'Nira' means ‘only the joy, absolute joy’.

20:46.427 --> 20:49.517
And who would like to give up the joy for what?

20:50.248 --> 20:53.260
For a cake or for a tea or this thing?

20:53.460 --> 20:56.631
I mean, just think of it!

20:59.162 --> 21:04.948
The joy is so deep, so intense, so beautiful.

21:06.127 --> 21:09.307
I don’t know what else to say.

21:11.956 --> 21:13.737
You have not tasted the ambrosia,

21:13.937 --> 21:15.744
otherwise you would have said, as if the

21:15.944 --> 21:19.909
ambrosia is trickling down on your tongue.

21:20.147 --> 21:23.192
It’s like that, the taste of it.

21:26.676 --> 21:31.898
But what I find that the depth we have not touched.

21:32.113 --> 21:34.382
Which is within us. All of you have that depth.

21:34.582 --> 21:38.269
That not that you don’t have. I have not given you Realisation

21:38.495 --> 21:43.063
because you are just there, here

21:43.282 --> 21:46.071
because you have that depth within you.

21:46.297 --> 21:48.672
You are special people with that depth.

21:48.891 --> 21:53.522
But you haven’t touched it. It shows you haven’t touched it.

21:54.656 --> 21:57.948
Supposing it’s like a well full of water,

21:58.148 --> 22:00.921
but you are still dangling somewhere in the middle,

22:01.122 --> 22:02.677
you haven’t yet touched that depth.

22:02.878 --> 22:07.443
Because once you get into that, you get completely drenched

22:07.723 --> 22:09.554
and lost.

22:09.755 --> 22:11.745
But if that is not the situation,

22:11.945 --> 22:15.636
that shows that you are still somewhere dangling in between

22:15.836 --> 22:19.572
and any time you can come high and dry.

22:21.229 --> 22:24.353
So you have to judge yourself.

22:25.529 --> 22:29.663
This is the time for you to judge you are in connection with Christ.

22:29.969 --> 22:31.795
He achieved His resurrection,

22:31.996 --> 22:35.081
by which we have to achieve our resurrection.

22:35.285 --> 22:37.587
But what have we done

22:37.795 --> 22:41.849
to achieve that resurrection which He has achieved?

22:42.258 --> 22:45.789
He intensely

22:46.039 --> 22:50.038
lived a life of complete sacrifice

22:51.437 --> 22:55.069
and complete concentration

22:56.866 --> 22:58.751
towards one goal:

22:58.951 --> 23:02.793
that He has to achieve the resurrection.

23:06.074 --> 23:09.754
Nothing else was important to Him.

23:12.546 --> 23:16.273
All that attention was on one thing

23:18.878 --> 23:23.387
that, “I have to achieve this resurrection.

23:23.588 --> 23:28.176
I have to get crucified and I have to be resurrected,

23:28.376 --> 23:32.743
because the whole world has to be resurrected.”

23:36.208 --> 23:39.004
But Sahaj Yogis,

23:39.489 --> 23:42.997
I don’t know how many think that way,

23:43.387 --> 23:47.479
how many think that dedication is needed.

23:48.604 --> 23:52.112
And the best part of it

23:52.479 --> 23:55.533
that it’s so joy-giving.

23:55.745 --> 23:59.183
Every step you move forward,

23:59.472 --> 24:02.253
it’s so joy-giving.

24:02.597 --> 24:06.925
This sinking in that well

24:07.280 --> 24:09.594
is so very joy-giving.

24:09.794 --> 24:13.461
It’s not painful, you don’t have to crucify yourself,

24:13.671 --> 24:18.195
you don’t have to carry the cross. He’s done it for you.

24:20.279 --> 24:22.555
So what do you sacrifice?

24:22.824 --> 24:26.277
Is your laziness!

24:29.539 --> 24:32.672
When it comes to the satisfaction of ego,

24:32.872 --> 24:35.906
people are overactive.

24:36.993 --> 24:39.270
They are like bullets then.

24:39.537 --> 24:43.498
And when it is the satisfaction of their physical comfort,

24:43.754 --> 24:46.675
they become – I don’t know.

24:47.756 --> 24:50.350
We had one rakshasa called Kumbhakarna,

24:50.550 --> 24:53.760
who used to sleep for six months

24:53.960 --> 24:58.967
and used to be awake six months.

24:59.167 --> 25:03.122
But here I see people sleep for twelve months,

25:03.323 --> 25:06.329
so what do you call them?

25:10.427 --> 25:14.140
Then they say, “Mother, we can’t keep awake!” Why?

25:14.403 --> 25:18.411
Because you are not meditating,

25:18.866 --> 25:21.861
you are not one with Christ.

25:23.044 --> 25:26.381
Then His agnya, He controls.

25:27.578 --> 25:30.632
With that Agnya, you cannot sleep.

25:31.498 --> 25:36.232
If His blessings are there on the Agnya, you cannot sleep.

25:36.505 --> 25:39.359
You won’t believe with the slightest light,

25:39.591 --> 25:42.376
artificial light specially, I can’t sleep;

25:42.626 --> 25:45.516
because still Christ is awake

25:45.907 --> 25:48.916
and I have to be awake.

25:52.155 --> 25:56.646
So you have to be awakened to this fact that we are Sahaj Yogis.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.091
We have a special responsibility

25:59.291 --> 26:01.942
as our connection with Christ is.

26:02.175 --> 26:07.610
Our main responsibility is, all the time, intensely, to think,

26:07.810 --> 26:12.259
“What we can do for the betterment of human beings?

26:14.994 --> 26:18.087
And what are we doing about it?”

26:20.571 --> 26:23.508
First I used to say, “Count your blessings,”

26:23.724 --> 26:27.135
because that was the best way to make people understand

26:27.335 --> 26:31.235
that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga.

26:35.156 --> 26:37.603
Now I would say, “Count your deeds.”

26:37.859 --> 26:41.070
What have you done for Sahaj Yoga?

26:41.351 --> 26:43.802
Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.

26:44.460 --> 26:46.814
To say that Paramchaitanya will look after you

26:47.039 --> 26:50.086
is absolutely absurd!

26:53.679 --> 26:56.166
If Paramchaitanya could do everything

26:56.400 --> 26:59.569
why should it create human beings?

27:02.456 --> 27:05.496
One Adam and Eve were sufficient.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.502
You have to do it.

27:10.743 --> 27:15.422
Unless and until you become deep,

27:15.623 --> 27:19.688
it cannot trigger, it is helpless.

27:20.362 --> 27:24.510
It’s only through you it is going to work out.

27:29.634 --> 27:34.221
Now if there is no instrument, electricity cannot work, can it?

27:34.822 --> 27:38.137
Now you should say, “The electricity itself must come before me

27:38.338 --> 27:41.876
and must do everything!”

27:44.457 --> 27:49.512
You have to have the instrument and you are the instrument

27:49.739 --> 27:55.852
and if you do not want to do it, how can Paramchaitanya do it?

27:56.432 --> 27:58.515
It will be something like saying, as I told you,

27:58.715 --> 28:03.393
that, “Let electricity do the job, we’ll not have any instrument.”

28:04.919 --> 28:07.583
Can I work it out?

28:08.132 --> 28:11.083
Can you work it out?

28:16.185 --> 28:21.294
So Paramchaitanya has its own style.

28:22.282 --> 28:26.173
It can only work if you people want to work it out.

28:26.485 --> 28:31.126
It’s an energy and you are the instrument.

28:33.507 --> 28:38.264
But the instrument is more busy with the job,

28:38.954 --> 28:41.329
with the family, I don't know,

28:42.365 --> 28:45.896
all kinds of nonsensical things.

28:46.560 --> 28:52.545
Now supposing this instrument, which is meant for my lecture,

28:54.763 --> 28:57.856
forgets what it is

28:58.532 --> 29:01.818
and acts like a ladle in the kitchen

29:02.410 --> 29:06.437
because it’s fond of food, say, for example:

29:08.453 --> 29:12.602
then what’s the use of making this useless instrument?

29:12.836 --> 29:15.937
It doesn’t do what it has to do.

29:17.242 --> 29:22.015
It doesn’t know what it has been made for.

29:25.148 --> 29:30.983
It has no purpose at all. It’s such a useless stuff.

29:36.383 --> 29:40.995
So I feel there’s a kind of a lethargy,

29:41.196 --> 29:45.340
a kind of a very subtle lethargy working out,

29:48.934 --> 29:50.528
like this that,

29:50.728 --> 29:55.394
“We’ve done our job. Let the young people do it now!”

29:58.986 --> 30:01.502
You are matured,

30:01.776 --> 30:04.880
and the matured have to do the job.

30:10.041 --> 30:14.338
“We have done our level best!”.  What have you done so far?

30:24.148 --> 30:27.234
So much to be done still.

30:27.976 --> 30:30.905
And somehow or other

30:32.421 --> 30:33.844
we have to touch

30:34.099 --> 30:38.634
that area where such people remain like the yesterday’s player.

30:38.912 --> 30:42.216
He is not doing God’s work.

30:44.638 --> 30:47.562
He’s an artist

30:49.380 --> 30:54.239
and he’s working so hard to achieve perfection.

30:58.451 --> 31:02.342
He will get the same amount whether he’s perfect or not,

31:07.423 --> 31:09.484
but he’s practising at home,

31:09.727 --> 31:13.586
he’s listening to it, he’s trying to develop it.

31:14.711 --> 31:17.264
All the time working it out so that

31:17.557 --> 31:21.346
his performance should be excellent.

31:22.164 --> 31:24.639
So he’s seeking an excellence.

31:24.881 --> 31:28.936
Mediocrity has no place in Sahaj Yoga.

31:34.728 --> 31:37.361
Only through excellence you’ll enjoy.

31:37.564 --> 31:43.545
Only through excellence you will really become Sahaj Yogis.

31:45.365 --> 31:50.568
Otherwise, you could be a headache

31:51.263 --> 31:54.412
to me and to yourself.

31:57.762 --> 32:01.715
You would be a headache to Sahaj Yogis.

32:02.643 --> 32:05.870
A most non-progressive, destructive element

32:06.070 --> 32:11.331
I would say a person is who is not alert.

32:12.070 --> 32:15.086
You have to be aware,

32:15.790 --> 32:19.110
aware of your responsibilities.

32:19.407 --> 32:21.516
So far

32:22.106 --> 32:26.713
I have been saying that still the preparation is on,

32:26.928 --> 32:30.592
they have to correct themselves,

32:31.100 --> 32:34.107
they have to clear out themselves,

32:37.459 --> 32:43.435
they have to work it out, still their conditionings, this ego.

32:44.330 --> 32:49.135
But now, twenty years have passed

32:50.364 --> 32:53.099
and beware!

32:53.636 --> 32:57.925
Be aware that twenty-first year

32:58.246 --> 33:02.113
is going to be a very big jump.

33:02.574 --> 33:06.349
I’m warning you again and again and again and again.

33:07.037 --> 33:13.037
And you have to work very hard to develop yourself vertically

33:14.322 --> 33:18.825
in balance with your horizontal growth.

33:19.517 --> 33:22.896
It’s not my lecture for entertainment or anything,

33:23.130 --> 33:28.387
but should go to your heart, to your brain, to your being,

33:28.712 --> 33:32.114
as this is very important.

33:33.459 --> 33:37.027
And you are not going to waste it.

33:37.350 --> 33:40.863
All the time you have to think that you are a Sahaj Yogi

33:41.175 --> 33:45.965
and you have to know what you have to do in Sahaj Yoga

33:47.519 --> 33:50.394
and how to achieve it.

33:50.707 --> 33:52.726
You should not be satisfied

33:52.926 --> 33:56.598
unless and until you have achieved that excellence.

33:58.899 --> 34:02.049
That’s the very important, crucial point today

34:02.249 --> 34:05.915
I wanted to tell you because today is

34:06.321 --> 34:09.825
Easter Day which was a very crucial point

34:10.060 --> 34:14.188
for the development or the growth of the Spirit,

34:14.509 --> 34:17.571
because Sahasrara we could never have achieved

34:17.772 --> 34:20.837
if Agnya was blocked.

34:24.525 --> 34:25.967
Christ could have said,

34:26.167 --> 34:28.670
“All right, let Paramchaitanya do it!

34:28.870 --> 34:32.776
Let Paramchaitanya get itself hanged.

34:33.633 --> 34:36.508
Why should I do it?”

34:39.391 --> 34:44.843
He had to do it and He was the instrument and He’s done it.

34:46.944 --> 34:52.257
So Sahaj Yoga is not only for exploiters.

34:53.288 --> 34:59.075
If you try just to exploit Sahaj Yoga, you’ll be exploited too.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.602
But is for the exploitation of joy.

35:03.903 --> 35:08.434
But that’s only possible if you grow, you touch your depth.

35:08.686 --> 35:13.319
If you are not deep enough, you’ll hang in the air, as I said.

35:13.733 --> 35:17.832
And that has to be worked out, that has to be found out:

35:20.046 --> 35:24.056
how best you can do it, how much you can reach people,

35:24.257 --> 35:26.059
how many people you have given Realisation,

35:26.283 --> 35:30.047
how many people you’re going to help improve their health,

35:30.288 --> 35:33.947
their mental conditions and then

35:34.148 --> 35:38.041
how much you are going to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

35:41.502 --> 35:47.254
So that is going to work out what I call

35:47.738 --> 35:53.082
the collective ascent

35:56.004 --> 35:58.585
of human beings.

35:59.350 --> 36:02.483
May God bless you!

36:17.357 --> 36:21.911
To be in connection with Christ is to be

36:22.161 --> 36:26.130
enjoying your meditation.

36:35.017 --> 36:37.071
All right.

36:37.313 --> 36:43.071
So, puja is another thing which, I know it, helps you a lot.

36:44.532 --> 36:48.375
It gives you a definite push, I should say,

36:48.625 --> 36:51.468
but you don’t retain it.

36:53.828 --> 36:57.898
You don’t retain it. Then what’s the use?

36:59.128 --> 37:02.656
So also you have to retain,

37:06.747 --> 37:10.112
should have power to retain.

37:10.737 --> 37:13.891
That’s only possible if you have

37:15.018 --> 37:19.172
touched your depths, which you have.

37:21.953 --> 37:26.976
I am so happy to come back to you all.

37:27.796 --> 37:30.570
I missed you all very much.

37:30.890 --> 37:36.521
I’m travelling and working very hard.

37:39.021 --> 37:44.215
I don’t know if I work hard. I don’t think about it, never.

37:46.551 --> 37:51.199
So once you know that this is what you have to be,

37:51.449 --> 37:54.953
then you don’t work, it just works.

37:57.427 --> 38:02.617
Then you don’t think you are working.

38:04.001 --> 38:07.900
This is a subtle point you have to understand:

38:08.993 --> 38:12.602
that everything works out

38:14.811 --> 38:17.985
and you work in a way

38:20.916 --> 38:24.920
and it works out, but you don’t work.

38:27.315 --> 38:30.400
Like the Sun shines:

38:30.822 --> 38:34.212
if you ask the Sun, “Poor Sun, you have to work so hard!”

38:34.463 --> 38:39.085
He said, “When? When was that?”

38:40.085 --> 38:42.937
So you say, “You have to rise in the morning, then you have to…”.

38:43.179 --> 38:48.653
“No, no, no, no, no! I was just with myself, nothing else.

38:48.864 --> 38:53.825
I was with myself, I was enjoying myself. When did I work?”

38:56.577 --> 38:59.773
As long as you are with yourself

38:59.974 --> 39:02.454
there is no question of you getting bored

39:02.655 --> 39:05.698
or no question of you getting tired, nothing.

39:05.898 --> 39:09.040
You are with yourself, finished!

39:10.512 --> 39:14.376
But unless and until that happens within you

39:14.641 --> 39:16.268
then these problems do come up,

39:16.469 --> 39:20.870
and so please, please again I would say,

39:21.303 --> 39:24.318
value your Self-realisation,

39:25.225 --> 39:29.701
value your Realisation, value your life.

39:29.959 --> 39:32.475
You all are very precious people

39:32.676 --> 39:36.301
and you are the ones who are chosen.

39:39.855 --> 39:43.303
I hope all of you come to Sahasrara day

39:43.504 --> 39:49.404
after a very intensive meditative time.

39:53.319 --> 39:59.288
Otherwise suddenly I’ll find people who are doing Sahasrara puja

39:59.694 --> 40:02.928
with their all Sahasraras caught up.

40:06.353 --> 40:09.361
May God bless you!

40:51.989 --> 40:54.200
May God bless you.
