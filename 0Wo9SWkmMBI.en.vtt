WEBVTT

14:04.080 --> 14:14.292
Every year we have birthdays of various
people,

14:14.493 --> 14:19.444
and every year we make a vow that,

14:19.660 --> 14:26.012
“This year I will not do this or
I will not do that.”

14:30.777 --> 14:41.244
This is a very good way of seeing how far
we have come in life.

14:44.969 --> 14:53.251
Many people who really have achieved

14:53.941 --> 14:58.970
a very great height in their spiritual life

15:00.677 --> 15:03.759
did not need a birthday,

15:03.960 --> 15:13.064
but every day they felt it’s a birthday
to start,

15:17.020 --> 15:24.217
to go ahead, to understand, to learn.

15:24.418 --> 15:29.106
Every day is a new year for them.

15:30.973 --> 15:46.846
In our own life we see that our
surroundings change very slowly.

15:47.260 --> 15:53.050
Sometimes it is shocking; sometimes you
are surprised

15:53.258 --> 15:58.068
how the surroundings are not changing.

15:58.293 --> 16:08.697
But, in a subtle way, there is a tremendous
change

16:08.898 --> 16:15.708
that is happening within us and without.

16:16.417 --> 16:24.177
The whole atmosphere today is governed
by human beings.

16:25.432 --> 16:33.522
I don’t know how far Paramchaitanya
works it out,

16:33.732 --> 16:45.609
but it is for us to open ourselves to new
dimensions in our lives.

16:46.049 --> 16:50.979
For example, if we find we still have…

16:51.196 --> 16:55.745
through our introspection we locate

16:55.946 --> 17:03.898
that we have these old, subtle, nonsensical
things still hanging around us,

17:04.147 --> 17:10.611
we don’t have to vow for it. You have
to just witness it,

17:10.812 --> 17:18.374
and the destructive path it is taking
you to.

17:18.575 --> 17:22.349
Immediately you will give up.

17:22.550 --> 17:28.596
You don’t have to worry as to put a vow
upon yourself,

17:28.797 --> 17:32.696
because now you are “samarth”,

17:32.897 --> 17:45.482
meaning now you are absolutely empowered.

17:45.936 --> 17:52.236
Whatever you think is wrong, your
attention itself on it

17:52.437 --> 18:00.704
will slowly, gradually remove the doubts

18:03.678 --> 18:14.596
about having those problems, those
connections,

18:14.797 --> 18:23.036
conditions and ego that are lingering
still.

18:23.236 --> 18:28.579
Definitely you will drop them.

18:28.779 --> 18:35.208
With your attention it will run away.

18:37.610 --> 18:45.155
Then you will realise that every day your
attention is getting purified,

18:45.356 --> 18:52.869
getting powerful, getting compassionate.

18:53.080 --> 19:03.825
Normally, whatever reaction you have
in your attention just disappears,

19:04.026 --> 19:08.648
and you start witnessing the whole thing,

19:08.849 --> 19:14.003
and your power of attention,

19:14.204 --> 19:22.855
through that witnessing force, acts and it
works.

19:23.056 --> 19:33.365
It works not only on you, but on everything
that surrounds you.

19:34.177 --> 19:41.624
Firstly, through your meditation, in that
state of meditation,

19:41.825 --> 19:51.098
you expand within yourself. You stay
in the present.

19:51.601 --> 19:56.166
The other day, somebody asked me,
“Where was Your last birthday?”

19:56.367 --> 20:01.354
I just forgot where it was.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.410
Otherwise my memory is very good, like
an elephant.

20:08.610 --> 20:11.625
But this I forgot.

20:11.826 --> 20:26.506
Perhaps, every time, every day, you live
in the present and you grow,

20:26.707 --> 20:34.151
so you forget when and where this growth
has taken place.

20:36.199 --> 20:42.320
My own growth has been like this

20:43.523 --> 20:52.704
that every time I go to a place,

20:55.062 --> 21:02.843
I find very nice new people coming in

21:03.044 --> 21:11.542
and some of the horrible ones from the old
lot disappearing.

21:11.743 --> 21:18.278
It’s something like, when the tree grows,

21:18.551 --> 21:26.182
the leaves go on falling and new leaves
start coming.

21:27.345 --> 21:32.417
But in Sahaja Yoga, it’s something
different I find,

21:32.618 --> 21:47.006
that on the tree of Sahaj Yog very few,
very very few leaves fall off,

21:47.207 --> 21:55.493
and you sometimes face a lush garden
of beautiful people.

21:57.897 --> 22:08.272
To me, it’s like a miraculous fireworks.

22:08.473 --> 22:20.001
It starts like a small line and then opens
up into several beautiful patterns.

22:20.979 --> 22:26.716
It is impossible to envisage
or to visualise

22:26.916 --> 22:39.189
what will happen to us, to Sahaj Yog
and to all of you.

22:41.819 --> 22:48.135
I have never learned to imagine things,

22:48.700 --> 22:58.870
but the vision that you see is really
remarkable, it’s very remarkable,

22:59.071 --> 23:09.338
that I see all Sahaja Yogis drenched
in Divine Love

23:09.902 --> 23:30.186
and expressing themselves in a very
beautiful and very deep manner.

23:30.439 --> 23:41.713
This, when comes in, that really makes your
attention absolutely enwrapped

23:41.914 --> 23:49.451
in such Divine Bliss that you forget that
moment.

23:49.652 --> 23:55.870
One of those moments are when you celebrate
my birthday.

23:56.071 --> 24:02.202
I even forget how many years I have lived
on this Earth.

24:02.839 --> 24:08.001
Sometimes I say I am seventy-three,
sometimes I say I am seventy -

24:08.202 --> 24:14.807
I just don’t know. Because, as I told you,

24:15.132 --> 24:28.078
it does not leave any mark of time,
of date, of years, in that blissful state.

24:28.279 --> 24:35.068
As if sometimes you can think that you went
to see something very beautiful,

24:35.269 --> 24:39.407
like Taj Mahal, without knowing what it is,

24:39.608 --> 24:48.365
and suddenly you find such a beautiful
building unexpectedly.

24:48.566 --> 24:55.630
You just get blindfolded, as they say.
In Hindi say “avak”.

24:55.831 --> 25:02.287
You don’t know how to express, you become
speechless.

25:02.744 --> 25:09.403
And invariably you’ll find, that time
you’ll forget the time.

25:09.604 --> 25:13.941
You will forget how you came there.

25:14.142 --> 25:17.601
All the story behind all that finishes off

25:17.802 --> 25:23.073
as soon as you see the reality of
the vision.

25:23.365 --> 25:37.683
This reality of the vision is something
beyond even my thinking and imagination.

25:39.412 --> 25:50.014
I cannot, even now sometimes, believe that
there are so many Sahaja Yogis

25:50.215 --> 25:54.387
who have got this subtle knowledge.

25:57.677 --> 26:03.513
I never knew that there are so many
seekers, to begin with.

26:04.532 --> 26:10.001
I never knew that there are such subtle
people on this Earth.

26:10.202 --> 26:23.008
All over the world, wherever I went,
whether I went to Nepal or to Brazil,

26:23.378 --> 26:33.435
suddenly I find facing so many beautiful
seekers.

26:34.182 --> 26:37.149
If you ask me, “When did You go
to Brazil?”,

26:37.350 --> 26:41.046
I won’t be able to tell you the dates.

26:41.247 --> 26:45.699
I have very bad memory for dates for
the same reason, I think,

26:45.900 --> 26:49.174
because every time I see a vision.

26:49.375 --> 26:57.171
And the time also just stops for that
moment.

26:57.372 --> 27:01.621
It doesn’t express itself,

27:01.822 --> 27:07.708
nothing is recorded, except for
the experience.

27:07.932 --> 27:17.828
And this experience is in an abstract form.
You cannot describe it.

27:18.317 --> 27:29.532
It is beyond words and beyond any
description.

27:29.990 --> 27:37.174
At that time you really become thoughtless,

27:37.965 --> 27:45.247
and that is the time we have to really
enjoy.

27:45.448 --> 27:53.780
The greatest curse of modern times is
the watch, all the time that we keep.

27:54.964 --> 28:06.707
And all the time we are just seeing
the time, what time it is now,

28:06.923 --> 28:12.386
and after two seconds again also you want
to see what is the time.

28:14.560 --> 28:19.168
We have crossed the limits of time -
kalatit.

28:19.369 --> 28:27.745
Try to understand why we have crossed,
because time moves according to us.

28:28.114 --> 28:31.288
You can experience it.

28:31.537 --> 28:35.210
The other day I was coming from Delhi,

28:35.411 --> 28:42.539
and in my household everybody seems to be
very particular about time.

28:42.740 --> 28:46.147
So they were after my life, “Come along,
come along. Getting late, getting late.

28:46.363 --> 28:52.927
Now, you just can’t get into the plane,”
this, that. All right.

28:53.252 --> 28:57.252
And when I reached there, they said that,
“The plane is still waiting.

28:57.470 --> 29:01.250
It’s not…  it’s not necessary for you
to hurry up.

29:01.451 --> 29:06.495
It will take at least fifteen, twenty
minutes for you to go.”

29:06.696 --> 29:13.289
So, also this name of ‘airport’ makes
people really jumpy, I should say.

29:13.514 --> 29:17.989
They have to go to the aeroplane means
as if some war is there

29:18.190 --> 29:21.549
or I don’t know what it is.

29:22.609 --> 29:29.846
So far, luckily, I have never missed a
plane, never missed a train in my lifetime.

29:30.047 --> 29:37.158
Though I travel, I think, quite a lot.
I have every time found, invariably,

29:37.359 --> 29:46.307
that the plane itself is waiting for me,
it won’t leave.

29:46.508 --> 29:53.122
Like, I’ll give you a very interesting
example today, if you are relaxed.

29:53.658 --> 30:11.677
We were in Prague, and we were supposed
to go to Poland via…

30:11.878 --> 30:18.049
again same thing happens to me with
experience I had... via Vienna.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.597
And we had a very great Sahaja Yogi with us

30:21.798 --> 30:26.185
who told me that the plane will be leaving
at eleven o’clock.

30:26.402 --> 30:32.184
And from the airport he rings me up,
“No, the plane is leaving at 9:30.”

30:32.385 --> 30:37.538
If I want, I can be ready in five minutes
or I can take two hours, depends on.

30:37.739 --> 30:39.828
So I was ready, I just jumped into the car.

30:40.028 --> 30:43.674
We reached the airport, but we were
late by fifteen minutes,

30:43.875 --> 30:49.815
and the ground lady started shouting at me
at the top of her voice,

30:50.016 --> 30:53.483
“You people, you are VIPs, you are this,
you are that.”

30:53.684 --> 30:56.940
All kinds of things she said to me.

30:57.140 --> 31:00.561
And this Sahaja Yogi could not bear it,

31:00.769 --> 31:05.269
and he felt that it was his mistake (that)
he told me a wrong time,

31:05.486 --> 31:09.677
“That’s why this lady is shouting at
my Mother.”

31:09.878 --> 31:14.104
He couldn’t bear it. He was very unhappy.

31:18.130 --> 31:22.244
[Aside to somebody: “You can turn it round.
Turn it.”]

31:22.498 --> 31:34.568
So, we went into the aeroplane with this
lady shouting behind,

31:35.194 --> 31:39.578
and we saw that the pilot and engineers,
they were busy

31:39.779 --> 31:43.098
with some correction of the machinery.

31:43.299 --> 31:47.937
They said, “It is little bit out of order,
it will be ready.” So we sat down.

31:48.138 --> 31:56.116
Now this Sahaja Yogi could not bear it, and
his tears started rolling down his eyes.

31:56.317 --> 32:00.998
Then another Sahaja Yogini, she said,
“Brother, it’s all right. Don’t cry.”

32:01.199 --> 32:04.428
They were sitting behind me, I just turned
round.

32:04.629 --> 32:07.724
I said, “It’s all right. Don’t worry.”

32:07.925 --> 32:11.245
He said, “No Mother, because of me she
could say all these things,

32:11.446 --> 32:16.534
you know, I can’t bear it.” And he couldn’t
stop crying.

32:16.735 --> 32:24.810
Within one minute, the sky, which was
absolutely open,

32:25.011 --> 32:30.548
was covered with big clouds like huge,
big elephants

32:30.749 --> 32:36.191
walking into the whole area - very big.

32:36.392 --> 32:40.365
All the Sahaja Yogis who were standing
also on the other side,

32:40.566 --> 32:45.790
on top of the airport, saw it happening.

32:45.991 --> 32:49.985
The whole thing became absolutely
jet-black.

32:50.186 --> 32:56.201
“Oh, my God,” I said, “see, the tears
of this gentleman has such powers.”

32:56.402 --> 33:00.477
And then the airport people told us that
this plane is out of order,

33:00.678 --> 33:08.071
so we have to get down. So we got down,
we came back.

33:08.272 --> 33:12.826
Then he went to this ground hostess
and told her,

33:13.026 --> 33:19.428
“Now, whom should we shout at? Now the
plane is not going, should we shout at you?

33:19.637 --> 33:23.426
How dare you shout at my Mother and
all those things?”

33:23.627 --> 33:30.985
But all the people there at the airport,

33:31.186 --> 33:37.580
who were still in… under the same regime
style, got such a fright.

33:37.781 --> 33:40.658
The manager himself walked to me. He said,

33:40.859 --> 33:44.674
“For your plane there’s still five hours
and if you want out

33:44.875 --> 33:47.547
we can give you permission, all of you
can go out.”

33:47.748 --> 33:53.533
And he took me by a special way. I couldn’t
understand this reaction though.

33:53.741 --> 33:57.107
So I went out and we did some shopping
or something,

33:57.308 --> 34:00.691
and when we came back we were surprised.

34:00.892 --> 34:04.792
All the airport was rather stunned by us.

34:04.993 --> 34:08.646
And when I walked, that was the only plane
that was leaving.

34:08.847 --> 34:13.119
All the traffic had stopped except
for this plane.

34:13.320 --> 34:19.880
And when we walked down to board the plane,

34:20.096 --> 34:25.804
the gentleman who was there said, “Mother,
can you help me?” I said, “How?”

34:26.005 --> 34:30.622
“I have got a terrible back pain.” I said,
“How can I do it?”

34:30.823 --> 34:34.186
Then one lady walked in to say, “Mother,
please,

34:34.387 --> 34:38.936
I have pain in my shoulder. Can you put
Your hand on that?”

34:39.137 --> 34:41.667
I just put my hand on her shoulder

34:41.868 --> 34:45.548
and she said, “I am feeling all right.”
She started lifting her arm.

34:45.749 --> 34:52.910
Then I went. I thought I’d better now
take to the aeroplane.

34:53.111 --> 34:55.898
When I was walking, the same gentleman
came to me,

34:56.099 --> 34:59.189
he said, “Why not put hand on my back?”

34:59.389 --> 35:02.526
I said, “I have to board the plane.”
He said, “I’ll walk with You.

35:02.727 --> 35:06.265
You just put Your hand on my back.
I’m sure I’ll be all right.”

35:06.465 --> 35:12.125
And we walked together about two minutes
or so, he said, “I’m all right.”

35:12.326 --> 35:16.115
The whole atmosphere changed.

35:16.316 --> 35:21.843
It was such a tremendous effect on these
people who have been under a regime

35:22.044 --> 35:27.071
and have been really military-like, and
the whole treatment was so funny.

35:27.272 --> 35:33.952
The whole thing changed in such a short
time,

35:34.153 --> 35:42.351
and I was amazed how the tears of this
Sahaja Yogi has worked this wonder.

35:42.552 --> 35:48.586
Now, imagine a moment when tears started
rolling his eyes,

35:48.787 --> 35:53.454
that moment just manifested a big drama.

35:53.655 --> 35:58.120
And, ultimately, what you find is

35:58.320 --> 36:08.914
that the people at the airport became
extremely humble and respectful.

36:10.757 --> 36:19.588
So when we start thinking of time and time
and time,

36:20.637 --> 36:27.774
we have to understand that time is our
slave; we are not slaves of the time.

36:27.975 --> 36:30.963
There are thousand and one stories I can
tell you

36:31.164 --> 36:38.241
how, by delaying in a place, by getting
late in a place,

36:38.442 --> 36:45.116
by not caring for the time, I have seen
such beautiful manifestations,

36:45.316 --> 36:53.270
such beautiful dramas - the art
of the Divine Power -

36:53.471 --> 37:00.804
that I was amazed how people worry so much
about the time.

37:01.553 --> 37:10.448
If time is really necessary, if we are all
watching our time

37:10.904 --> 37:14.697
every year, as our birthday,

37:14.898 --> 37:21.173
and if you think that time is very
important, it is in a way.

37:21.374 --> 37:28.258
In these modern times, we really need
the time for meditation,

37:28.459 --> 37:34.062
for collective meetings and for Sahaja
Yoga.

37:35.105 --> 37:40.096
I know when there was the war
of independence

37:40.297 --> 37:44.525
in this country, where my parents fought

37:44.726 --> 37:49.759
with all their ‘tana’ [body], ‘mana’
[mind], ‘dhana’ [wealth].

37:49.960 --> 37:56.156
That time I remember how they never
cared for anything.

37:56.357 --> 38:01.829
They went all out, because it was very
important

38:02.030 --> 38:10.599
to get this country freed from the clutches
of the Empire.

38:11.367 --> 38:16.396
And this was so important.

38:16.597 --> 38:19.125
They had to meet somebody at such a point.

38:19.326 --> 38:25.688
That man, supposing, is escaping from the
jail, or there’s some sort of a thing on,

38:25.889 --> 38:29.126
they could not afford to miss the time.

38:29.327 --> 38:36.645
They could not afford to just neglect that
important time, important meeting,

38:36.846 --> 38:42.612
important discussion, because everything
had become an emergency.

38:42.813 --> 38:46.392
For them, nobody told them, nobody gave
them lectures,

38:46.593 --> 38:51.165
but for them, from inside. They were
all legendary people, I should say,

38:51.366 --> 38:56.132
the way they fought for their freedom.

38:56.817 --> 39:00.558
This is, today, the same situation.

39:00.759 --> 39:05.587
It is an emergency, a very subtle
emergency

39:05.787 --> 39:13.102
that nothing is more important than
spreading Sahaja Yoga.

39:13.788 --> 39:19.185
If some people will miss it, will not know
about it,

39:19.386 --> 39:22.674
we will be responsible for that.

39:22.874 --> 39:27.550
At the time of Christ, Buddha, Mahavira
or anyone of them,

39:27.758 --> 39:31.371
there were no aeroplanes to travel.

39:31.572 --> 39:35.005
There were not these loudspeakers,

39:35.206 --> 39:40.889
also other communications and televisions
and all those things.

39:41.090 --> 39:45.367
All these things have come now.

39:46.014 --> 39:48.835
That has been manifested now.

39:49.035 --> 39:58.018
It is the work of Paramachaitanya.

39:58.219 --> 40:03.082
Through scientists, through other
knowledge,

40:03.283 --> 40:08.015
all this manifestation has taken place.

40:08.215 --> 40:12.353
Also, these people didn't have to face
people, so many,

40:12.554 --> 40:18.855
nor did they… were supposed to give
realisation to people in such a big number.

40:19.055 --> 40:24.583
So all these inventions,

40:25.005 --> 40:34.356
all that you see today as modern ventures
which we have got,

40:34.565 --> 40:38.828
they are all for Sahaja Yoga.

40:39.029 --> 40:47.819
Without Sahaj Yog, you cannot imagine
what would happen to this world.

40:48.020 --> 40:54.178
The first and foremost thing is we have
no peace within our hearts.

40:54.379 --> 40:58.717
We talk of peace. I know of people who
have got awards in peace,

40:58.917 --> 41:03.029
have no peace within their heart, no peace
at all.

41:03.229 --> 41:07.852
Unless and until we human beings have
peace,

41:08.053 --> 41:11.554
there cannot be peace in the whole world.

41:11.754 --> 41:17.670
It is we who create wars. It is we who
do all kinds of violence.

41:17.871 --> 41:27.435
It is we, we ruin the possibility of people
getting into the Kingdom of God.

41:27.635 --> 41:32.463
So, peace can be only achieved

41:33.213 --> 41:39.482
by establishing peace in the hearts
of the people.

41:39.683 --> 41:48.514
And that is only possible, that you achieve
the state of thoughtless awareness.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.525
You remain in the present.

41:51.733 --> 41:57.729
And there, where you’ll be amazed, you
will be standing like a rock,

41:57.930 --> 42:02.972
because you will have reality in your hand.

42:03.172 --> 42:05.441
You can work out the way you like.

42:05.642 --> 42:09.358
Actually, I don’t work out anything
whatsoever, really.

42:09.559 --> 42:13.307
You may say, “You do this and You
do that,” I don’t.

42:13.507 --> 42:20.361
It’s the Paramachaitanya, which works it.
In the same way, it will work for you also.

42:20.562 --> 42:29.037
But you must have faith in yourself and
absolute faith in Sahaja Yoga. Absolute.

42:29.237 --> 42:34.939
That’s the only way we can achieve this,

42:35.140 --> 42:42.399
that many, many, many people, most
of the people of the world -

42:42.600 --> 42:47.777
I wouldn’t say all of them, rather
difficult to say that but may be possible -

42:47.977 --> 42:51.193
should enter into the Kingdom of God
with us.

42:51.394 --> 42:55.567
That’s the most important thing, more than
all these worldly things,

42:55.768 --> 43:00.327
and more than all these nonsensical things.

43:01.109 --> 43:09.680
So the attention should be how many
people we are going to bring to Sahaj Yoga,

43:09.880 --> 43:19.171
how many we are going to save, what
are we going to do about it.

43:19.372 --> 43:22.433
When you have to think about it every
morning,

43:22.634 --> 43:26.586
how can you remember the time and date?

43:26.787 --> 43:33.058
When you are in emergency now, and you know
that this emergency has to be fulfilled,

43:33.258 --> 43:43.494
then how can you just pay attention to all
worldly things, all worldly achievements?

43:43.695 --> 43:47.941
That will take its own course. You don’t
have to worry.

43:48.141 --> 43:51.699
That works out automatically.

43:51.899 --> 43:56.878
Only thing where you really need your
own diversion,

43:57.079 --> 44:02.645
or your own focusing, is Sahaja Yoga,
in and out.

44:02.846 --> 44:08.305
If we really want peace on this Earth, if
we want really progress for ourselves,

44:08.505 --> 44:13.043
if we want all kinds of physical, mental
and emotional problems being solved,

44:13.244 --> 44:16.548
all for our good, why not we come
to Sahaj Yoga,

44:16.748 --> 44:25.133
where we don’t have to do anything except
for raising our Kundalini,

44:25.334 --> 44:31.173
except for meditating for it for very
little time

44:31.373 --> 44:36.461
and to achieve that state of joy?

44:36.972 --> 44:44.987
Today my feelings are really full of joy,
full of joy,

44:45.188 --> 44:50.317
because now I can see how things are
happening,

44:50.518 --> 44:57.676
how one person can produce thousands
and thousands of Sahaja Yogis.

44:57.877 --> 45:01.151
I saw one miracle, I told once

45:01.351 --> 45:07.155
that one seed has all the thousand trees
it is going to produce

45:07.355 --> 45:12.701
and when I saw a new technique of tissue
culture,

45:12.902 --> 45:16.145
I was amazed that on one little seed

45:16.346 --> 45:23.836
there were so many little, little primules
who had come out.

45:24.037 --> 45:29.411
In the same way, you are all capable, and
you all can do it,

45:29.611 --> 45:32.601
but what is needed is faith in yourself

45:32.801 --> 45:37.867
and also complete sincerity about Sahaja
Yoga.

45:38.068 --> 45:43.938
If that happens today, you have really
celebrated my birthday.

45:44.145 --> 45:48.897
If you think that my birthday is important,

45:49.097 --> 45:56.455
that for me very important is that
everybody gets their spiritual birthday.

45:56.656 --> 45:59.626
May God bless you.
