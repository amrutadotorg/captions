WEBVTT

02:51.510 --> 03:00.470
Now My stay in England is completing its 12th
year and that is the reason I wanted to talk

03:00.470 --> 03:05.900
to you people about Sahaja Yoga.

03:05.900 --> 03:15.370
How far it has gone and where are we lacking.

03:15.370 --> 03:26.470
The greatest thing that has happened is that
we have established our religion: Nirmala

03:26.470 --> 03:46.220
Dharma as we call it, the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

03:46.220 --> 03:52.390
And you know the meanings of the words, vishwa
means universal, nirmala means pure and dharma

03:52.390 --> 03:57.569
means religion.

03:57.569 --> 04:01.440
This has been established in America.

04:01.440 --> 04:07.970
And we have to register it here in England.

04:07.970 --> 04:19.260
Now it is very important that, when we belong
to a religion, we have to know what are the

04:19.260 --> 04:27.979
commandments of that religion is.

04:27.979 --> 04:31.550
And so far we have not drafted anything.

04:31.550 --> 04:39.479
It cannot be a thing made suitable to people
or suitable to human beings.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.280
It cannot be.

04:41.280 --> 04:48.650
And it cannot compromise with your suitability.

04:48.650 --> 04:53.180
Like in Russia, as I told you the story, I
went there and I said, “I would like to

04:53.180 --> 04:55.000
see a church."

04:55.000 --> 05:07.229
So they took me down
to a church, which was the Orthodox Greek

05:07.229 --> 05:17.970
Church, and My husband was also there where
we were VIPs, so the head of the church came

05:17.970 --> 05:26.719
down and took us to lunch; and he said that
today, these days, they are fasting so he

05:26.719 --> 05:35.380
cannot take any meat.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.219
We said, “Alright."

05:37.219 --> 05:43.990
We all sat down, but he went on drinking,
drinking, drinking.

05:43.990 --> 05:47.669
So much so, that he forgot that he had guests
or anything!

05:47.669 --> 05:51.320
He never even came to see us off!

05:51.320 --> 05:55.630
So the officers who were with us started all
laughing when we came out.

05:55.630 --> 05:59.340
And he didn’t know where he was!

05:59.340 --> 06:02.520
Because he was fasting you know!

06:02.520 --> 06:13.000
So when we came out these officers said that,
“See, this is religion."

06:13.000 --> 06:19.300
Then they told me the story that Tsar had
an idea that everybody has got a religion,

06:19.300 --> 06:23.120
why not Russia also should have some religion.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.650
So they sent for the Catholic people to come
down and tell them about Catholicism.

06:28.650 --> 06:33.330
So the Catholics came, that time there was
only Catholicism, so they came and they said,

06:33.330 --> 06:43.900
“Alright, Catholicism is very simple that
you can drink, do what you like, only thing,

06:43.900 --> 06:47.590
you cannot marry again."

06:47.590 --> 06:59.569
Tsar said, “This won’t work out in Russia,
is difficult, not for us."

06:59.569 --> 07:05.100
So he said, “Alright, now let’s have another
one."

07:05.100 --> 07:10.310
So they sent for the muslims, Islam.

07:10.310 --> 07:26.680
So the Muslims came in and they said that,
“You can marry any number of wives, doesn’t

07:26.680 --> 07:31.620
matter, but you can’t drink."

07:31.620 --> 07:40.320
They said, “This won’t suit us!”

07:40.320 --> 07:46.710
So they had another third religion that was
this [that was] supposed to be orthodox.

07:46.710 --> 07:48.900
Orthodox religion, the most liberal one!

07:48.900 --> 07:54.860
Was this orthodox, Greek religion and they
said, “Oh, you can drink and you can have

07:54.860 --> 07:56.849
as many wives as you like as long as you give
us sufficient money."

07:56.849 --> 08:03.099
Only their interest was money.

08:03.099 --> 08:04.099
They said, “This is alright, very good religion!

08:04.099 --> 08:10.970
We have to give them money and only thing
they have to do is to call us religious so

08:10.970 --> 08:15.279
that we are religious people; nobody should
say that they have no religion!”

08:15.279 --> 08:17.272
That’s how the religion came into this country,
Russia.

08:17.272 --> 08:23.479
And with this kind of a religion, who is going
to believe in it?

08:23.479 --> 08:24.880
It’s correct!

08:24.880 --> 08:32.390
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you can see that
all these so-called religious bodies have

08:32.390 --> 08:36.690
ruined the name of religion completely.

08:36.690 --> 08:43.300
All those people, who talked of religion this,
that, and one theory to another theory, one

08:43.300 --> 08:49.930
incarnation to another incarnation they used,
have ended up into a nonsensical stuff.

08:49.930 --> 08:58.360
And everybody is seeing so clearly now that
it does not give you any, any idea whatsoever

08:58.360 --> 09:06.120
as to what is God, as to the experience of
God.

09:06.120 --> 09:12.350
So this religion that was established, was
to give balance to people, has made them very

09:12.350 --> 09:13.350
imbalanced.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.589
They are fanatics, every one!

09:14.589 --> 09:20.370
Protestants, as I told you, are the greatest
fanatics because they are very subtle and

09:20.370 --> 09:27.630
they are very sophisticated, so nobody can’t
find out their fanatic ideas.

09:27.630 --> 09:38.550
With this, now we have Sahaja Yoga, and Sahaja
Yoga has given you Realisation, the real experience

09:38.550 --> 09:40.640
of the Divine.

09:40.640 --> 09:48.150
For the first time now you can feel that you
are the Spirit, you can feel the powers of

09:48.150 --> 09:49.150
Spirit.

09:49.150 --> 09:56.120
There are so many ways, in these 12 years
you must have seen, that you should be convinced

09:56.120 --> 10:03.670
that there is an All-pervading Power, which
is active, which is helping you, through which

10:03.670 --> 10:09.720
you have come up to this stage and that It
has empowered you to do miraculous things.

10:09.720 --> 10:17.490
We have got My photographs to give you a proof.

10:17.490 --> 10:22.680
The other day someone took a photograph in
Jordan at the time of Sahastrar puja thinking

10:22.680 --> 10:25.279
that, “Mother give a bandhan to Jordan."

10:25.279 --> 10:30.990
And the photograph has got the light, the
bandhan light in it!

10:30.990 --> 10:39.019
So the Unconscious is working, very strongly,
and It is trying to help people to understand

10:39.019 --> 10:45.630
God’s ways, so we cannot change His ways,
His styles, His rituals, His methods.

10:45.630 --> 10:51.230
That’s why I’m here to tell you, I am
like the mouthpiece of the Unconscious to

10:51.230 --> 10:57.399
tell you what is to be done, what is right,
what is wrong, what is not to be done.

10:57.399 --> 11:07.130
Now, in this religion, you yourself are awakened
into religion yourself!

11:07.130 --> 11:10.350
You become sensitive to religion yourself!

11:10.350 --> 11:14.500
The coding and everything is within yourself.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.880
You have to yourself feel it: How you feel
vibrations?

11:17.880 --> 11:19.529
When you feel vibrations?

11:19.529 --> 11:21.269
How do you lose vibrations?

11:21.269 --> 11:22.630
What happens?

11:22.630 --> 11:25.540
All those things are just within yourself.

11:25.540 --> 11:31.500
Of course, after some time, we might be able
to say what behavioural changes one should

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
take.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.430
But you can find out yourself, if you want
to find out – what is right and what is

11:36.430 --> 11:41.090
wrong and what is to be done to keep up the
vibrations.

11:41.090 --> 11:48.060
But vibrations are, [in] one way, extremely
charitable, very charitable things.

11:48.060 --> 11:53.200
Even if you do little wrong they may not disappear
that moment, but you’ll get a feeling within

11:53.200 --> 11:54.200
yourself that this wrong.

11:54.200 --> 12:00.750
After some time you’ll find, it will show,
that you have no vibrations and you wouldn’t

12:00.750 --> 12:03.450
know that you have no vibrations!

12:03.450 --> 12:11.870
So the first principle of sahaj dharma is,
or what you call Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, is

12:11.870 --> 12:21.930
that you should be able to keep up your vibrations
going as they are, or increase them or improve

12:21.930 --> 12:23.900
on their sensitivity.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.650
The more sensitive you are the better you
are.

12:27.650 --> 12:35.830
If the sensitivity is lacking then one must
say that Sahaja Yoga has failed in you, so

12:35.830 --> 12:40.870
far, and you have to work it out.

12:40.870 --> 12:55.130
But the problem of human being is very different,
that is that, when they’re ascending, when

12:55.130 --> 13:06.470
they are trying to get out of the bhavasagara,
there are so many human things which are with

13:06.470 --> 13:16.589
them, and those things try to bring them down
again, back to the place from where they started.

13:16.589 --> 13:24.720
For example, say, you are a person, who has
had no power at all in life and also you are

13:24.720 --> 13:30.650
a person, who has enjoyed some powers – both
are just the same; both are power drunk or

13:30.650 --> 13:32.310
power hungry or whatever you may call them.

13:32.310 --> 13:40.010
A starving is a same as a man who aspires
for food all the time – both are starving.

13:40.010 --> 13:46.470
In the same way, the one, who aspires for
power in both ways is the same [type of] person.

13:46.470 --> 13:53.240
When he comes to Sahaja Yoga, instead of becoming
humble and understanding that there’s something

13:53.240 --> 13:58.960
lacking in me, myself, he starts forming groups.

13:58.960 --> 14:06.180
He starts saying, “Alright, this is not
good, this fellow is not good, you better

14:06.180 --> 14:13.350
correct yourself, you do that, you do this,”
in others .

14:13.350 --> 14:23.760
He does not want to become a perfect person
himself.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.779
The one, who has attention towards anything
like that or falls into any group whatsoever,

14:28.779 --> 14:34.120
goes into trouble and I immediately know,
from his face, there’s something wrong with

14:34.120 --> 14:36.680
this person.

14:36.680 --> 14:42.149
So to form into groups itself is a sign of
our deterioration.

14:42.149 --> 14:52.930
Like in our cells in the body now, say, for
example, there are blood cells which are flowing:

14:52.930 --> 14:58.750
suddenly, when they are harmed or sick or
anything, they coagulate together and it forms

14:58.750 --> 15:02.440
a lumpish thing in it.

15:02.440 --> 15:08.790
So when you are moving you are free; then
one must understand that you are healthy.

15:08.790 --> 15:15.310
But as soon as there’s a barrier made that,
“This man is bad, this woman is bad,”

15:15.310 --> 15:17.940
so, now a barrier exists.

15:17.940 --> 15:19.570
The whole group forms.

15:19.570 --> 15:25.339
One group here and one group there and one
group there.

15:25.339 --> 15:31.339
But as Sahaj Yoga is complete discretion,
which is to be developed by the people who

15:31.339 --> 15:38.500
practice it – discretion – they have to
also know that there are some people who are

15:38.500 --> 15:44.550
not to be dealt with, to be discarded – individually.

15:44.550 --> 15:53.720
Like there’s somebody, one person, ‘X’
person is there, who is caught up very much

15:53.720 --> 15:57.360
and he’s got lots of badhas, this, that.

15:57.360 --> 16:02.380
Now if he’s badhic or anything, everybody
must individually drop him.

16:02.380 --> 16:08.960
Not to discuss him or talk about him collectively
but just drop him – if they were sensitive.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.770
If you are sensitive, immediately you know
this person has a badha.

16:13.770 --> 16:14.770
Nobody will go close to him.

16:14.770 --> 16:17.560
But invariably I’ve seen in groups, when
we meet, always five bhoots, if there are,

16:17.560 --> 16:19.430
they will all sit together.

16:19.430 --> 16:23.520
Immediately you know the bhoot is there – localised.

16:23.520 --> 16:28.880
And the five good people will never sit together.

16:28.880 --> 16:33.700
That means we are not yet developed ourselves,
individually, within ourselves.

16:33.700 --> 16:39.930
So, the first attitude to develop this dharma
within us…the dharma here means the one

16:39.930 --> 16:43.510
that is going to develop in our central nervous
system.

16:43.510 --> 16:47.050
Our own new dimension we have to develop within
ourselves.

16:47.050 --> 16:53.930
In a deeper way it is what we call the subtler
being that is within us.

16:53.930 --> 17:04.150
Is to be awakened [so] that it lies in the
nerves we can say, itself, in the central

17:04.150 --> 17:06.360
nervous system.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.890
To develop that we have not worked out, why?

17:08.890 --> 17:09.890
Because our attention is still outside.

17:09.890 --> 17:17.819
We are worried about another person, we are
worried about third person, we are worried

17:17.819 --> 17:20.360
about this, “He shouldn’t say this”,
“he shouldn’t do."

17:20.360 --> 17:29.240
But the person who is really trying to improve
himself will always go inward.

17:29.240 --> 17:34.490
Now supposing this is a person, who has a
badha, he’ll just shun that person, will

17:34.490 --> 17:39.440
be away from that person, will not say anything
collectively, will not discuss it, will not

17:39.440 --> 17:41.000
talk about it, just finish it.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.790
“[He’s] not alright."

17:42.790 --> 17:51.039
But then you may say, “Mother, then at least
50% Sahaja yogis would be like that."

17:51.039 --> 17:52.919
I don’t think so.

17:52.919 --> 17:58.289
If you can scan it out yourself, you’ll
find there are about 4 or 5 like that who

17:58.289 --> 18:03.059
are badhics – which I know – the rest
of you are alright.

18:03.059 --> 18:08.179
But when you come in contact with them, then
you get it because you have not developed

18:08.179 --> 18:11.779
that powerful personality within you.

18:11.779 --> 18:18.630
And that’s how I get sick myself, because
you are within myself.

18:18.630 --> 18:23.510
So all of you must individually look after
yourself, so collectively, that’s me, I

18:23.510 --> 18:24.510
am looked after.

18:24.510 --> 18:36.260
But we do not look after ourselves that’s
the main point is.

18:36.260 --> 18:42.420
There are so many methods by which we can
just become perfect.

18:42.420 --> 18:46.450
How much time do we spend in that?

18:46.450 --> 18:52.799
Now, in the ashrams whatever I have heard
about England: that it’s the greatest place

18:52.799 --> 19:00.380
where one can become absolutely lost!

19:00.380 --> 19:05.890
If you want to lose your vibration, go to
an English ashram!

19:05.890 --> 19:09.780
Especially in London.

19:09.780 --> 19:13.990
The vibrations in the ashram are the worst
of all.

19:13.990 --> 19:14.990
Can you imagine such a thing?

19:14.990 --> 19:19.750
I mean.

19:19.750 --> 19:23.750
Why it happens?

19:23.750 --> 19:26.429
One lazybones comes in the ashram.

19:26.429 --> 19:29.470
He’s got a bhoot in him.

19:29.470 --> 19:31.500
He’s a lazy person.

19:31.500 --> 19:35.120
Normally a person should be active!

19:35.120 --> 19:36.841
So what he does?

19:36.841 --> 19:38.570
He does not want to get up in the morning.

19:38.570 --> 19:42.580
Another one tries to follow him.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.990
How are you going to ascend?

19:44.990 --> 19:47.640
Let us think about this.

19:47.640 --> 19:53.870
This lecture should not be just listened to,
is to be practiced, is to be understood, you

19:53.870 --> 19:57.280
have to be serious about it.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.430
How are we going to ascend?

19:58.430 --> 20:05.570
Are we going to ascend by reading the book
‘Ascent’ or by listening to Mother’s

20:05.570 --> 20:08.730
tapes, which is very interesting?

20:08.730 --> 20:12.290
How are we going to improve?

20:12.290 --> 20:14.970
By taking the medicine.

20:14.970 --> 20:15.970
What is the medicine?

20:15.970 --> 20:21.240
Is nothing but meditation itself is the medicine.

20:21.240 --> 20:27.300
Now when do you do meditation?

20:27.300 --> 20:31.760
You have to do meditation in the morning time;
that’s the best time, because you are not

20:31.760 --> 20:32.760
yet busy.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.130
Early in the morning you get up and do it.

20:35.130 --> 20:37.500
But you just can’t get up!

20:37.500 --> 20:39.080
“I can’t get up."

20:39.080 --> 20:40.080
Why not?

20:40.080 --> 20:46.080
That day you just don’t eat your food the
whole day.

20:46.080 --> 20:50.920
Next day you’ll get up!

20:50.920 --> 20:54.710
You have to treat your body in such a way
that it becomes your slave.

20:54.710 --> 21:03.450
You have to use this body for enslavement,
and not this body for your enslavement, your

21:03.450 --> 21:05.730
Spirit’s enslavement.

21:05.730 --> 21:12.360
So if you could just understand that the only
way to ascend is through meditation and not

21:12.360 --> 21:22.950
through all kinds of politics talking, jabbering,
mental feats – nothing of the kind!

21:22.950 --> 21:35.140
But I have seen people, they cannot steadily
do it, what we call ‘satatya’ (सातत्य

21:35.140 --> 21:36.320
– constancy) means ‘consistently’.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.690
They will do it today and do it tomorrow.

21:38.690 --> 21:51.590
But in the ashram it should be a rule!

21:51.590 --> 21:54.610
Every morning there should be some nice music
to be played.

21:54.610 --> 21:59.470
In India the radio starts at about 6 o’clock,
in Bombay.

21:59.470 --> 22:03.650
I don’t know if you have seen to that?

22:03.650 --> 22:10.400
And six o’clock the first thing is the one,
what we call the awakening of the gods, Bhupali

22:10.400 --> 22:14.160
(raga) they start it.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.630
They start singing that.

22:15.630 --> 22:24.100
From 6 to 8 nothing but bhajans and God’s
songs are there, nothing else.

22:24.100 --> 22:31.010
The whole of Bombay has to listen to that,
there’s nothing else, no news.

22:31.010 --> 22:40.270
So, early in the morning when you get up,
you can start with some sort of a conch or

22:40.270 --> 22:44.880
anything that you want to, or with the bells
or maybe what we call the ghanta that thing

22:44.880 --> 22:45.950
we have like that.

22:45.950 --> 22:51.730
Or you can start with a bhajan so that everybody
gets up.

22:51.730 --> 22:56.280
Go and have your baths.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.920
Keep the room hot.

22:59.920 --> 23:07.780
Come and sit down for your meditation.

23:07.780 --> 23:13.700
Now those, who are householders, could be
even worse than this because that’s also

23:13.700 --> 23:20.700
another, “my house, my child, my family."

23:20.700 --> 23:22.400
This ‘my’ business.

23:22.400 --> 23:27.160
I have to struggle through all this, because
everybody [says] “I am marrying this person,”

23:27.160 --> 23:30.950
“Now that person is running away, so I have
to marry another person."

23:30.950 --> 23:34.250
“That is about to run, then I have to get
the third!”

23:34.250 --> 23:35.730
Problem of the children.

23:35.730 --> 23:37.809
Then, “how to get the children?”

23:37.809 --> 23:40.240
All the time this problem is there.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.120
Everybody is bothering me with this problem:
“What to do with the wife?

23:43.120 --> 23:44.179
Where to keep her?

23:44.179 --> 23:45.570
She’s so horrid!”

23:45.570 --> 23:47.419
This, that and everything!

23:47.419 --> 23:54.140
Now all these problems can be solved on one
point, if you are a strong person, you can

23:54.140 --> 23:57.040
solve the problem like that.

23:57.040 --> 24:04.510
So, instead of wasting your energy in solving
these side matters why not you become something

24:04.510 --> 24:11.590
great yourself and get the problem solved
by itself?

24:11.590 --> 24:14.520
It’s logical.

24:14.520 --> 24:22.160
But what I have seen about people is this,
that they do not understand their own value

24:22.160 --> 24:23.920
and worth.

24:23.920 --> 24:31.780
Now as I have said, this is Shiva’s country,
Sadashiva’s country, is the Kailasha itself.

24:31.780 --> 24:43.250
And where you are born, where you are Sahaja
yogis – what is your position here?

24:43.250 --> 24:49.200
Into what position have you come?

24:49.200 --> 24:51.350
Where are you?

24:51.350 --> 24:56.929
Think of your position in the land of Sadashiva.

24:56.929 --> 25:05.559
The other day only I told them that in the
land of Sadashiva, ganas are there.

25:05.559 --> 25:09.300
And as the Americans got the idea of The Smurfs,
they are the ganas.

25:09.300 --> 25:14.080
You won’t find any Smurf sitting down, he
is so active.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.080
Not one Smurf you’ll find who is sitting
down.

25:15.080 --> 25:21.560
Either he’ll be a barber or he’ll be a
washerman or he’ll be a beginner, or he’ll

25:21.560 --> 25:30.730
be a fiddler or he’ll be some thing doing!

25:30.730 --> 25:35.700
So to become that you have to be active in
your body.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.040
The activity in the body has to come.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.640
But from where to get the energy for the activity?

25:41.640 --> 25:42.640
From the Spirit.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.670
And if you do not meditate how will you get
to that?

25:45.670 --> 25:51.170
You just tell me – is there any way out?

25:51.170 --> 25:58.950
This is the basic problem that people do not
have regular habits.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.510
They do not.

26:00.510 --> 26:04.770
They are very hectic people, extremely hectic.

26:04.770 --> 26:07.250
In the West people are extremely hectic.

26:07.250 --> 26:11.520
Indians are that way quite regularised because
of a very strong parenthood.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.530
Parents themselves are sensible and regular.

26:14.530 --> 26:18.179
We have to be regular too.

26:18.179 --> 26:22.360
There are no regular habits: somebody will
get up at 6 o’clock, somebody will get up

26:22.360 --> 26:25.080
at 9 o’clock, somebody will get up at 10
o’clock.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.410
And if you are to wake up an Englishman, they
say, “Use a bargepole!”

26:28.410 --> 26:31.480
Of course, that’s the greatest sin!

26:31.480 --> 26:33.530
That’s the greatest sin!

26:33.530 --> 26:36.450
But even if you have to commit the sin – use
a bargepole!

26:36.450 --> 26:46.400
So, sleep is such an important thing for them
and they are always tired.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.280
Now why this tiredness comes in, we must understand,
is due to heart.

26:50.280 --> 26:55.120
Because the heart is weak that’s why you
become tired.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.179
If you raise the heart you’ll be alright.

26:58.179 --> 27:01.330
So, one by one we see why.

27:01.330 --> 27:04.570
Why is it, heart weak?

27:04.570 --> 27:09.440
Because we have done anti-God things.

27:09.440 --> 27:14.830
We have done things which we should not have
done, so our heart is weak.

27:14.830 --> 27:23.429
They are always tired and they are not ashamed
of saying, “I am tired!”

27:23.429 --> 27:33.450
Anybody who listens to the television will
be surprised, they’ll have, “Huuuhhh!”

27:33.450 --> 27:38.107
Within five minutes at least you must hear
6, 7 times “Huuuhhh!” coming out.

27:38.107 --> 27:39.107
Young people!

27:39.107 --> 27:40.107
They’ll come and sit on the chair “Huuuhhh!”.

27:40.107 --> 27:41.500
First I used to think it is a fashion, that
you must do like this, otherwise you are not

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
impressive.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.730
Because, you know, the fashions here to impress
people are so funny!

27:45.730 --> 27:55.270
I don’t understand, I thought it was a fashion.

27:55.270 --> 27:56.450
But why you are tired?

27:56.450 --> 27:57.450
Let’s see why are you tired?

27:57.450 --> 27:58.450
Your heart, heart is catching.

27:58.450 --> 27:59.450
Why is heart catching?

27:59.450 --> 28:02.800
In the very subtlest of subtlest, is that
you have done anti-God things.

28:02.800 --> 28:08.760
Now how do you cure that?

28:08.760 --> 28:11.299
Now let Me have answers.

28:11.299 --> 28:17.470
Vicki Halperin: We will put You, Mother, in
our heart.

28:17.470 --> 28:19.950
Shri Mataji: Good idea.

28:19.950 --> 28:22.570
You have to put Me in your heart.

28:22.570 --> 28:30.550
Now see how the cosmos of the whole Sahaja
Yoga system since long has been built in,

28:30.550 --> 28:32.610
in you.

28:32.610 --> 28:40.200
Heart is the most important part, from [which]
everything circulates.

28:40.200 --> 28:49.700
This heart is the one, when it fails, you
are dead, no more there.

28:49.700 --> 28:55.380
The Spirit resides in the heart, alright.

28:55.380 --> 29:02.270
Now you are made like this even in your head
that the heart centre comes up exactly on

29:02.270 --> 29:12.300
the brahmarandhra, where it has to break.

29:12.300 --> 29:15.610
So, if your heart is weak, you cannot pierce
through.

29:15.610 --> 29:25.919
So, putting Me in your heart and raising Me
to your Sahastrara, that’s the best way

29:25.919 --> 29:26.970
you can cure your heart.

29:26.970 --> 29:27.970
But that’s not so!

29:27.970 --> 29:31.870
You also put some theological concepts on
that.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.160
I’ve seen people do.

29:34.160 --> 29:42.940
So, “Mother, I put You in my heart, I love
You very much,” this, that, everything.

29:42.940 --> 29:48.330
But I see there’s not Mother there at all!

29:48.330 --> 29:50.070
Just lip service!

29:50.070 --> 29:57.620
“I’m putting You in my heart, of course
you are there!”

29:57.620 --> 30:00.360
But where am I?

30:00.360 --> 30:01.600
I try to find.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.000
I can’t see Myself there.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.140
No, I am not there.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.140
So from where do I see you?

30:10.140 --> 30:11.140
Through your eyes.

30:11.140 --> 30:16.710
If I am there I can see through your eyes,
I can penetrate up to that.

30:16.710 --> 30:20.309
Such eyes are very different.

30:20.309 --> 30:27.500
Your eyes have to change through your heart.

30:27.500 --> 30:32.520
There’s no deception in between.

30:32.520 --> 30:37.280
If your heart changes your eyes will change.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.360
You don’t have to tell Me.

30:39.360 --> 30:44.410
I know that.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.420
So this, “I love You,” Why?

30:46.420 --> 30:54.309
“Because I wanted to have a job,” finished!

30:54.309 --> 31:00.090
“I love You Mother, because I thought my
marriage problem will be solved."

31:00.090 --> 31:04.540
“I give You this, because I’ll get money!”

31:04.540 --> 31:10.920
“I pray for you, because I must have a child,”
or something like that.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.630
It’s so much below.

31:12.630 --> 31:29.843
But the state [you] must reach, where “I
just love You for nothing at all.

31:29.843 --> 31:30.843
Just love You because I enjoy it.

31:30.843 --> 31:31.843
I enjoy that love for my own enjoyment.

31:31.843 --> 31:33.830
Just for my own enjoyment I love You.

31:33.830 --> 31:46.510
Not even for the ascent or anything but I
just enjoy that love within myself.

31:46.510 --> 32:03.370
For nothing at all, just for myself I love
You."

32:03.370 --> 32:10.000
As long as you live on relative terminology
you cannot work it out.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.970
Now, “Why do I live in the ashram?

32:15.970 --> 32:20.799
It’s cheap to live there, it’s easy, children
are looked after you know, quite nice, you

32:20.799 --> 32:22.020
are safe.

32:22.020 --> 32:23.020
Mother also comes sometimes.

32:23.020 --> 32:26.789
If you are sick She’ll look after us, so
She treats us.

32:26.789 --> 32:31.120
Otherwise, I leave it to Mother to do everything."

32:31.120 --> 32:39.770
Still you are in duality.

32:39.770 --> 32:43.980
You have to just love Me because you enjoy
it.

32:43.980 --> 32:45.894
Otherwise, I’m not asking you to love Me
am I?

32:45.894 --> 32:46.894
How can you ask anyone, “You, love me!

32:46.894 --> 32:47.894
Come along!”

32:47.894 --> 32:48.894
And you put a pistol, “Come along, love
me!”

32:48.894 --> 32:49.894
Can you do it?

32:49.894 --> 32:50.894
You can’t.

32:50.894 --> 32:59.559
You can demand money, you can demand anything,
but can you say, “Alright, now hands up,

32:59.559 --> 33:03.360
give me your love!”?

33:03.360 --> 33:08.110
So it cannot be forced.

33:08.110 --> 33:16.980
So the depth of the heart must be brought
in.

33:16.980 --> 33:21.960
Now heart is covered with funny ideas.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.370
The thought, which is in the mind, as we say.

33:25.370 --> 33:31.659
Actually the thoughts are covering the brain
and those thoughts ultimately cover the heart.

33:31.659 --> 33:36.840
I have told you what is the connection between
heart and the brain is.

33:36.840 --> 33:44.300
Now, so if these thoughts are covering our
heart, how can we open out?

33:44.300 --> 33:52.610
For example, a thought is there that, “I
love Mother, because She has to sell my house."

33:52.610 --> 33:58.370
Alright, now the house doesn’t sell.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.730
“How is it?

33:59.730 --> 34:05.640
Mother I said it will be sold, then why is
it not sold?”

34:05.640 --> 34:08.899
This is not the level of Divine Love.

34:08.899 --> 34:11.059
You are going to love the Divine.

34:11.059 --> 34:13.399
It has to be pure love of simple purity.

34:13.399 --> 34:19.790
And that depth you all have, that’s the
special thing you have.

34:19.790 --> 34:29.839
All of you have that within you, that heart
within you.

34:29.839 --> 34:46.649
If you understand this very small thing is
actually the seed of all the mantras.

34:46.649 --> 34:55.980
Now when you say that you love Me very much,
I do not think you do love.

34:55.980 --> 35:06.609
But you ask yourselves, “Do I really love
Mother?”

35:06.609 --> 35:07.900
Now face [it].

35:07.900 --> 35:10.230
“No, I do not."

35:10.230 --> 35:14.520
“Still there are so many other foolish ideas
into my head.

35:14.520 --> 35:24.789
Still I am an intellectual, still I’m seeing
Mother from an intellectual point of view

35:24.789 --> 35:27.110
or from an emotional side."

35:27.110 --> 35:42.810
It’s a state, it’s a state of nirananda,
is a state.

35:42.810 --> 35:50.890
And such a person is never challenged and,
even if he is challenged, is never affected.

35:50.890 --> 35:57.510
Such a person suddenly stands out and you
see a lotus before your eyes.

35:57.510 --> 36:07.450
Now you are sitting in the city which is governed
by Sadashiva.

36:07.450 --> 36:12.980
Here you are born.

36:12.980 --> 36:22.530
You are all the great Spirits who are born
[here].

36:22.530 --> 36:29.799
Now you are the ones who have to give fragrance
to the whole world.

36:29.799 --> 36:41.720
It has nothing to do with any other thing
like status, money, position, nothing.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.900
What was the status of Christ?

36:43.900 --> 36:45.809
He was a carpenter’s son.

36:45.809 --> 36:47.730
How much did he earn?

36:47.730 --> 36:48.730
Nothing.

36:48.730 --> 36:50.410
Did He go to any university?

36:50.410 --> 36:51.410
Never.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.920
Did He study any Greek mythology or something
like that?

36:54.920 --> 36:55.970
Never.

36:55.970 --> 37:03.310
Did He bother His head about libraries?

37:03.310 --> 37:04.360
Never.

37:04.360 --> 37:08.560
But, He was Christ.

37:08.560 --> 37:16.870
In the same way, it does not matter to what
level you go, to what extent you go in your

37:16.870 --> 37:22.730
material side, it is your spiritual side which
is important.

37:22.730 --> 37:25.800
And for that it is important you must face
it.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.980
That’s only possible in meditation.

37:28.980 --> 37:33.160
Honestly to face it!

37:33.160 --> 37:47.800
But the trouble is as soon as Mother gives
the lecture, it’s finished there.

37:47.800 --> 37:56.160
Nobody thinks….(a baby is crying) what has
happened?

37:56.160 --> 38:00.349
Why are you crying?

38:00.349 --> 38:01.859
You want to go to mummy?

38:01.859 --> 38:02.859
Don’t cry, don’t cry!

38:02.859 --> 38:03.859
Mummy is there.

38:03.859 --> 38:04.859
Don’t cry, don’t cry, it’s alright.

38:04.859 --> 38:08.240
Now, as I said, 12 years of My tapasya is
over.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.270
I have really worked very hard, I must say.

38:10.270 --> 38:15.000
England is not easy, and London is even worse.

38:15.000 --> 38:23.690
And you get terrible pain from your liver
it starts moving towards your heart, just

38:23.690 --> 38:28.240
like a dagger, in this country.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.369
The liver is bad, the heart is dark.

38:31.369 --> 38:34.700
It’s not easy to live here.

38:34.700 --> 38:49.310
Moreover I have put all you in My heart and
you are circulating in My body [so] you have

38:49.310 --> 38:51.849
to be kind to Me.

38:51.849 --> 38:56.280
The level has to be much better.

38:56.280 --> 39:02.869
But as soon as somebody achieves some level,
people start criticising him, saying things

39:02.869 --> 39:11.960
against that person, forming groups, forming
things.

39:11.960 --> 39:21.610
As I told you before, you are also very fortunate
that I am here in England.

39:21.610 --> 39:25.430
I have spent much more time than I have spent
anywhere else.

39:25.430 --> 39:34.109
And still I cannot say definitely about anyone
of you, I mean of course some of them are

39:34.109 --> 39:38.010
perfect, but otherwise, that any day you’ll
become [like] John Gilpin (riding the horse

39:38.010 --> 39:39.010
of ego).

39:39.010 --> 39:40.210
You can’t say.

39:40.210 --> 39:46.100
Suddenly I find somebody is just suddenly
jumping on a horse.

39:46.100 --> 39:56.220
So this character that we have within us,
of becoming John Gilpin must be watched.

39:56.220 --> 40:00.500
Humility is needed.

40:00.500 --> 40:07.720
We have to be humble and see within ourselves:
“Why do we become John Gilpins suddenly?

40:07.720 --> 40:09.860
What happens to us?”

40:09.860 --> 40:17.040
This is a very, very common character.

40:17.040 --> 40:25.760
The example I’ll give [you]: I went to a
hotel with my husband, stayed overnight.

40:25.760 --> 40:37.950
It was in England and next morning, I think
there was a wedding or something or whatever

40:37.950 --> 40:40.150
it was.

40:40.150 --> 40:48.640
And two ladies, young girls, I would say about
25 years of age, wearing a nice dress and

40:48.640 --> 40:55.230
a hat and all that, talking to their boyfriends,
who were also very dandily dressed, talking

40:55.230 --> 41:03.589
as if they were some sort of dukes or duchesses
or something like that talking so big with

41:03.589 --> 41:06.510
their hats and this and that.

41:06.510 --> 41:12.461
My husband looked at Me, “By the way don’t
use spectacle, these are the girls, who come

41:12.461 --> 41:15.000
to clean in our office."

41:15.000 --> 41:16.930
I said, “Really?

41:16.930 --> 41:18.859
Look at them!

41:18.859 --> 41:24.180
Just putting the hat, they feel they have
become duchess or what?”

41:24.180 --> 41:31.839
And as soon as they saw him, they became very
peevish.

41:31.839 --> 41:35.830
(laughter) But I was very amazed that how
could they suddenly take up a role of a some

41:35.830 --> 41:41.930
sort of royal family stuff, you know, the
way they were walking! (laughter) And we couldn’t

41:41.930 --> 41:48.210
help laughing both of us, but, I mean, he
laughed much more because he said, “I can’t

41:48.210 --> 41:52.359
believe it they are…” and he could not
believe it for a while, but when they became

41:52.359 --> 42:03.950
peevish, the reaction, their reaction really
proved that they have just become a duchess.

42:03.950 --> 42:06.990
They had some hats on.

42:06.990 --> 42:12.060
If they wear a hat and talk big – finished
– now they are big.

42:12.060 --> 42:21.980
In the same [way] in spirituality: just because
you have been to Sahaja Yoga – finished

42:21.980 --> 42:28.950
– then now you are a yogi of Yogeshwara,
more than Shri Krishna, yourself.

42:28.950 --> 42:39.420
So one thing is this John Gilpin business,
which is stupid, which makes a mockery out

42:39.420 --> 42:40.420
of ourselves.

42:40.420 --> 42:49.790
There are stories and stories I can tell you
of this mockery: how ego makes you a stupid

42:49.790 --> 42:52.260
fool.

42:52.260 --> 42:57.210
So this is biggest hurdle I think we have,
here, is the ego.

42:57.210 --> 43:00.900
But then you tell somebody they’ll say,
“It was my ego.

43:00.900 --> 43:06.180
It did it!” as if the ego hangs somewhere
like a monkey, and the monkey came and did

43:06.180 --> 43:15.570
the job and again went back on its hanging
mood! (laughter) Otherwise, “It’s my bhoot

43:15.570 --> 43:17.720
which did it!”

43:17.720 --> 43:22.750
(laughter) But when do you do something?

43:22.750 --> 43:24.170
Why should we deceive ourselves?

43:24.170 --> 43:27.440
This is a very serious type of deception of
ourselves.

43:27.440 --> 43:28.440
Why?

43:28.440 --> 43:34.829
We are sahaja yogis, we are born in the Sadashiva’s
land; why not we be that beautiful being which

43:34.829 --> 43:39.720
is truthful, which is real, which is within
us, which is the Spirit?

43:39.720 --> 43:44.040
So the greatest hurdle is of our ego.

43:44.040 --> 43:54.510
Which can be shown in many ways.

43:54.510 --> 44:04.200
Because you see your reflection there.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.660
The first is, as I told you, wearing a hat:
means then the upper-lip goes up suddenly

44:07.660 --> 44:10.760
(a reference to ‘stiff upper lip’ of British).

44:10.760 --> 44:20.670
I think the hat sucks [it] in I think! (laughter)
Then they start saying sentences which are

44:20.670 --> 44:21.670
funny!

44:21.670 --> 44:31.329
I told you about, we had in our family a person,
who had epilepsy, and he was a mentally-off

44:31.329 --> 44:32.329
fellow!

44:32.329 --> 44:37.380
And sometimes he used to get into ego-trip.

44:37.380 --> 44:43.730
Then he would wear very good socks and he
would polish his shoes nicely, shine them,

44:43.730 --> 44:50.260
wear a nice shoes, wear a good suit, maybe
three-piece or something, and sit down on

44:50.260 --> 44:59.120
the bridge of our house where we had a, sort
of, an entrance to the gate and would sit

44:59.120 --> 45:00.120
there.

45:00.120 --> 45:03.130
And he would call someone, “I say big Bott,”
“I say, big Bott,” “I say, big Bott”

45:03.130 --> 45:06.839
I mean in English he knew only, “big Bott”.

45:06.839 --> 45:09.270
So he thought he was, he’s, an Englishman
now!

45:09.270 --> 45:11.980
He used to call everyone like this.

45:11.980 --> 45:15.950
And we would wonder why does he do like that?

45:15.950 --> 45:18.790
What is the thing that makes him say these
words like, “I say, big Bott”?

45:18.790 --> 45:30.710
He had seen some English people talking like
that.

45:30.710 --> 45:33.910
So he used to call all the people going on
the road like this, “I say big Bott,”

45:33.910 --> 45:34.910
“I say, big Bott”.

45:34.910 --> 45:40.349
So then in our family, if somebody becomes
John Gilpin, we say he’s become big Bott.

45:40.349 --> 45:44.770
So this, ‘big Bott’ business is horrid.

45:44.770 --> 45:45.770
Should be avoided completely.

45:45.770 --> 45:53.930
But the second thing that happens to us is
very good, is when we do not, I mean if you

45:53.930 --> 45:58.570
are sophisticated, well-educated, then it
is not “big Bott”, it is “bot bit”.

45:58.570 --> 46:02.290
Then we say sarcastic things!

46:02.290 --> 46:10.720
Say something in a sarcastic way, never in
a direct way.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.020
In a sarcastic way we enjoy.

46:13.020 --> 46:20.620
I mean, you see on the television you get
really surprised how people talk to each other

46:20.620 --> 46:21.620
sarcastically.

46:21.620 --> 46:26.030
“So what, Hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh!” goes on.

46:26.030 --> 46:27.510
And such sarcasm.

46:27.510 --> 46:33.869
And according to them sarcasm perhaps is the
intense intelligence or something like that.

46:33.869 --> 46:37.440
I don’t know, whatever it is certified,
as what.

46:37.440 --> 46:49.000
But whatever may be the certificate for it,
it’s the most gruesome act.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.220
These days we do not kill people, do we?

46:52.220 --> 46:54.800
If we kill, we’ll be handcuffed.

46:54.800 --> 47:00.450
We do not beat children, we do not beat anyone,
because we’ll be handcuffed.

47:00.450 --> 47:08.570
But to say a sarcastic thing is in modern
times the most gruesome act which is not punishable

47:08.570 --> 47:09.680
under law.

47:09.680 --> 47:16.720
But not under the law of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

47:16.720 --> 47:24.250
This sarcasm is the essence of English character.

47:24.250 --> 47:27.280
Take it from Me.

47:27.280 --> 47:31.060
Never say the things straightforward.

47:31.060 --> 47:38.850
And that’s the sign of intelligence and
been to a big training of it.

47:38.850 --> 47:51.280
First of all they’ll not say anything they
will sulk, keep quiet.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.390
Not to say anything.

47:54.390 --> 47:56.609
But if they say, they must say like this.

47:56.609 --> 48:01.079
Something that is sort of a stagnated, dirty,
filthy water that smells.

48:01.079 --> 48:06.470
They’ll not open their mouth, but once they
open their mouth, God save you!

48:06.470 --> 48:10.620
God knows what will come out of that mouth,
maybe some snakes, maybe some scorpions.

48:10.620 --> 48:11.620
And nobody feels hurt about it!

48:11.620 --> 48:20.240
That’s the best part of it.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.730
So this is one thing one has to guard against
– our Vishuddhi – not to use sarcasm.

48:23.730 --> 48:26.349
Comes from left Vishuddhi very much.

48:26.349 --> 48:27.670
[Not] at all!

48:27.670 --> 48:29.420
Because that’s against Me.

48:29.420 --> 48:32.490
I’m never sarcastic with you, am I?

48:32.490 --> 48:40.109
I tell you straightforward on your face, “You
have a bhoot on your head that’s all."

48:40.109 --> 48:44.230
Or if you have ego I said, “It’s ego."

48:44.230 --> 48:46.630
Why be sarcastic?

48:46.630 --> 48:54.510
So we have to learn how to be straightforward
and sweet.

48:54.510 --> 49:01.520
Let’s first decide today we are going to
say nice things to others.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.770
But no!

49:02.770 --> 49:06.530
Nice things will be like this.

49:06.530 --> 49:14.020
If somebody supposing is a person, who, say,
is a dwarf.

49:14.020 --> 49:17.400
So to say nice things, they will say, “Oh
what a tall man is coming!”

49:17.400 --> 49:31.630
Or is there’s a blind man coming, they will
say something, “Oh what eyes, beautiful!”

49:31.630 --> 49:41.250
So they start from physical to mental level
to anything.

49:41.250 --> 49:43.890
They go on describing a person.

49:43.890 --> 49:45.930
Why do you describe others?

49:45.930 --> 49:47.980
Why don’t you describe yourself?

49:47.980 --> 49:51.690
The whole energy’s spent in describing others.

49:51.690 --> 49:54.589
What about yourself?

49:54.589 --> 50:01.150
So this is another character that we have;
we hurt others through our tongues.

50:01.150 --> 50:08.099
This tongue is meant for giving the taste
of Divine to others.

50:08.099 --> 50:13.380
To say things that will make people feel comforted.

50:13.380 --> 50:15.800
For saying mantras.

50:15.800 --> 50:31.270
See, if you go on telling lies, your mantras
will never be fruitful, never activate.

50:31.270 --> 50:34.569
But if you are sarcastic, they will never
act.

50:34.569 --> 50:40.880
Say it thousand times, say it two thousand
times, say it million times.

50:40.880 --> 50:47.490
To make your mantras effective you should
stop talking in that manner.

50:47.490 --> 50:54.609
If you have to talk, talk something that will
be pleasing to another person.

50:54.609 --> 50:59.130
Now somebody might say, “Then if you say
pleasing, it may not be the truth”, alright,

50:59.130 --> 51:02.280
then don’t say it – not necessary to say.

51:02.280 --> 51:05.750
Just keep quiet.

51:05.750 --> 51:13.089
But you decide now to turn your head upside
down, which is all the time upside down already,

51:13.089 --> 51:20.370
so you put it right, now, and say that, within
yourself that, “Now no more of harshness

51:20.370 --> 51:31.760
from my tongue will flow,” because it will
never give you the power of mantras.

51:31.760 --> 51:36.040
Mantra powers are lost.

51:36.040 --> 51:43.940
If you have to say something, say it pleasingly.

51:43.940 --> 51:45.420
Always.

51:45.420 --> 51:49.700
Moreover if you have to correct someone, if
you are in a position, if you are the leader,

51:49.700 --> 51:50.700
if you have to say.

51:50.700 --> 51:57.100
Also say it in such a way that you neutralise
it.

51:57.100 --> 52:03.800
But no sarcasm at all!

52:03.800 --> 52:09.240
This is one of the very big snags we have
on our Vishuddhi.

52:09.240 --> 52:13.010
Now what is the other snag we have, let us
see.

52:13.010 --> 52:18.650
I’m talking to you, because just now I’m
a Britisher Myself.

52:18.650 --> 52:26.290
The another snag I find is saving pounds,
saving labour, saving everything else but

52:26.290 --> 52:27.290
your Spirit.

52:27.290 --> 52:32.520
Like I’ll tell you, if you want to find
an Englishman, that’s what Indian Sahaja

52:32.520 --> 52:36.220
yogis tell Me, very easy to find out an Englishman.

52:36.220 --> 52:42.920
You ask somebody to close the window; everybody
will try to do it except for the Englishman,

52:42.920 --> 52:47.900
who’ll be sitting down, he’ll never get
up; saving labour.

52:47.900 --> 52:53.849
And if you tell any work to an Englishman,
then he’ll stare at you like this; like

52:53.849 --> 53:03.349
this, “How dare you tell me [to] work?”

53:03.349 --> 53:12.650
As it is, I must tell you about Australians:
I used to think they are very healthy people.

53:12.650 --> 53:15.430
They are hardworking, no doubt, they are very
hardworking they come forward.

53:15.430 --> 53:22.050
But I went there and we had decided to cook
food for them in two centres for about, once

53:22.050 --> 53:25.730
for about 250 and again about 500 people.

53:25.730 --> 53:27.390
I mean, I go in to such ideas!

53:27.390 --> 53:34.630
So, in the first place, all the boys, who
came to help me, were all Indians.

53:34.630 --> 53:38.770
They were the ones, Who were lifting the thing
and all that.

53:38.770 --> 53:42.420
I said, “Tell these boys also, they are
Australians, after all they have eaten so

53:42.420 --> 53:46.349
much a meat, they must be having good muscles,
why are you doing it?”

53:46.349 --> 53:47.890
They said, “No, they are delicate people
Mother, don’t tell them."

53:47.890 --> 53:48.980
I said “delicate?

53:48.980 --> 53:49.980
How?”

53:49.980 --> 53:58.240
“They are very delicate, though they eat
meat they are very delicate, we know how to

53:58.240 --> 54:00.970
do, let us do it."

54:00.970 --> 54:07.720
And both the places the same people acted!

54:07.720 --> 54:08.720
You were there?

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
Last time?

54:09.720 --> 54:10.720
Yogi: No Mother, no.

54:10.720 --> 54:11.720
Shri Mataji: Who was there in Australia?

54:11.720 --> 54:12.720
Anybody?

54:12.720 --> 54:13.720
Yogini: I was there Mother.

54:13.720 --> 54:14.720
Shri Mataji: You were there?

54:14.720 --> 54:15.720
Isn’t it?

54:15.720 --> 54:16.720
Yogini: Yes Mother.

54:16.720 --> 54:17.720
Isn’t it?

54:17.720 --> 54:18.720
They were all Indians, who were working there,
mainly.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.720
Isn’t it true?

54:19.720 --> 54:20.720
Yogi: Yes true.

54:20.720 --> 54:21.720
Shri Mataji: Because they said that, “They
are delicate.

54:21.720 --> 54:23.220
At the slightest thing their waist line will
go out."

54:23.220 --> 54:25.360
(laughter) “They can’t lift these big
things.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.360
They just can’t!”

54:26.360 --> 54:29.220
And they would not allow, they said, “No,
no let us do it.

54:29.220 --> 54:32.950
We know they are delicate people."

54:32.950 --> 54:39.900
I was really surprised that for Australians
there were thinking like that.

54:39.900 --> 54:42.579
Then what about English?

54:42.579 --> 54:48.339
Because of avoiding labour, saving yourself
from labour, you have become weak people.

54:48.339 --> 54:55.230
If you don’t use one finger, you don’t
work, that will become a weak finger, always.

54:55.230 --> 55:01.500
Say, if your hand is in plaster for say, say
about a week or two weeks – you take out

55:01.500 --> 55:04.120
the hand out of the plaster, the hand cannot
hold itself.

55:04.120 --> 55:05.180
It becomes weak.

55:05.180 --> 55:06.240
Isn’t it doctor?

55:06.240 --> 55:11.010
It becomes weak, if you don’t use your hand,
it becomes weak.

55:11.010 --> 55:15.040
If you don’t use your body, your body becomes
weak.

55:15.040 --> 55:19.730
If you laze out, if you become lazy, you cannot
do any work, you don’t want to do any work,

55:19.730 --> 55:22.880
all your muscles will become useless.

55:22.880 --> 55:31.740
Till the age of at least sixty years you have
to use your body very much more than what

55:31.740 --> 55:33.040
you are using.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.660
So now they will do jogging.

55:35.660 --> 55:37.859
They’ll do jogging.

55:37.859 --> 55:45.430
After jogging it’s an out of proportion
thing that they do.

55:45.430 --> 55:47.560
They are so exhausted.

55:47.560 --> 55:50.130
But do your exercises, or whatever it is,
in normal way.

55:50.130 --> 55:52.109
But, actually, do your work!

55:52.109 --> 55:54.430
But they cannot.

55:54.430 --> 56:02.930
They cannot get up fast, they (Americans)
can, “I’ll get it."

56:02.930 --> 56:08.230
Americans, that way Americans, if you tell
them, they’ll say “I’ll get it."

56:08.230 --> 56:11.390
Telephone comes, “I’ll get it,” ten
persons will run and you’ll know they are

56:11.390 --> 56:12.390
all Americans!

56:12.390 --> 56:13.650
That’s why they have improved.

56:13.650 --> 56:15.050
They are so industrious.

56:15.050 --> 56:16.110
Very industrious people.

56:16.110 --> 56:17.520
Japanese are extremely industrious.

56:17.520 --> 56:29.660
They had the problem, because the cars could
not move out in the streets, were all full

56:29.660 --> 56:31.730
with the cars.

56:31.730 --> 56:37.730
So they wanted to build these flyovers and
within one year, within one year, within,

56:37.730 --> 56:44.330
they built the flyovers all over Tokyo, all
over Tokyo, which is a very large city.

56:44.330 --> 56:48.510
These small, little things, you know, they
walk like this.

56:48.510 --> 56:54.160
Little, little things with little, little
legs.

56:54.160 --> 57:02.830
(laughter) Hiroshima, which was bombed, if
you go and see that place, you won’t believe

57:02.830 --> 57:03.830
it was bombed!

57:03.830 --> 57:04.830
Except for the museum.

57:04.830 --> 57:09.650
And they have kept one building to show that
this is the place that was bombed.

57:09.650 --> 57:13.530
Otherwise you won’t believe that, that was
Hiroshima!

57:13.530 --> 57:16.720
Same with Nagasaki, I have seen it Myself
with both.

57:16.720 --> 57:23.420
I mean I can’t imagine how these people
have worked it out!

57:23.420 --> 57:25.619
So industrious!

57:25.619 --> 57:26.619
So industrious!

57:26.619 --> 57:28.550
So one is lethargy.

57:28.550 --> 57:35.630
Krishna has said…the first thing he’s
put it, the worst of all is lethargy.

57:35.630 --> 57:41.319
To Him the worst thing that can happen to
human being is lethargy.

57:41.319 --> 57:42.569
That is, “Alasyo bijayate”.

57:42.569 --> 57:44.950
everything comes out of alasya – laziness.

57:44.950 --> 57:45.950
Keep active!

57:45.950 --> 57:46.950
Do some work!

57:46.950 --> 57:58.400
But in Indian life, I tell you, even My mother
was like that, at anyone, if you are standing,

57:58.400 --> 58:03.880
“Why are you standing?”, if you are sitting,
“Why are you sitting?”, if you are walking,

58:03.880 --> 58:06.090
“Where are you walking?”

58:06.090 --> 58:12.440
You should be doing something all the time.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.540
You haven’t seen anyone in India.

58:14.540 --> 58:20.960
You have seen villages – even small children
are doing something.

58:20.960 --> 58:22.930
Such a hot country.

58:22.930 --> 58:24.980
In the day they might have a little siesta.

58:24.980 --> 58:25.980
It’s a very, very hot country.

58:25.980 --> 58:28.220
But all otherwise, they are working.

58:28.220 --> 58:36.050
That’s what, only the industriousness will
help you and will keep your mind out of mischief.

58:36.050 --> 58:43.040
Everything comes after you have decided not
to be lethargic.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.820
Tell your mind not to be lethargic.

58:45.820 --> 58:49.290
Lethargic minds brings you all these nonsensical
ideas.

58:49.290 --> 58:53.970
For that you must have regular habits, which
you do not have.

58:53.970 --> 59:00.920
I’m told that those who have been to colleges
and universities have been through some regular

59:00.920 --> 59:03.430
this thing or to some good schools.

59:03.430 --> 59:11.390
But once they went to drugs everything is
washed off.

59:11.390 --> 59:19.070
So drugs is one thing that kills all your
discipline, your proper training of satatya,

59:19.070 --> 59:20.320
of consistency.

59:20.320 --> 59:31.730
So to overcome that, you must make it a routineous
(sic) thing, certain thing.

59:31.730 --> 59:33.170
Absolutely routineous.

59:33.170 --> 59:36.780
[Then] you’ll get over it.

59:36.780 --> 59:43.190
I mean, it should be; because routine also
helps you in one way that you do not waste

59:43.190 --> 59:48.730
much energy about, say for example, I know
I have to give five strokes to My hair just

59:48.730 --> 59:51.700
to make it alright, so I give five strokes,
finished.

59:51.700 --> 59:55.400
One, two, three, four, five, done.

59:55.400 --> 01:00:01.710
But supposing I say, “No, sometimes five,
sometimes eight, sometimes seven,” then

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:05.369
I waste My time in brushing my hair.

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:08.460
So five strokes for the hair is alright.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:13.960
One wash, for one wash, three times just to
wash it off.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:21.220
If you can fix up things like that, you’ll
be surprised you’ll be saving lot of time.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:27.610
So this is another thing we do not have is
a definite number of things we have to do.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:31.260
I’ll tell you the story of Gandhiji, which
you will be surprised.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.450
Such a great man like him.

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:38.490
To go to his bathroom, so-called hut of his
bathroom was there.

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:42.260
In between his hut and that hut, was, there
were, he had put, seven stones.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.579
I don’t why he had put them seven.

01:00:45.579 --> 01:00:46.910
Seven stones one after another.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:52.650
While going there he used to count them, seven,
coming back he used to count them, seven.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:53.650
Alright.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:57.349
And somebody once put one more there.

01:00:57.349 --> 01:01:01.540
Because thinking they are too far away from
each other, whatever it is.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.080
Immediately he said “Why the eighth one?

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.080
Remove it!”

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.270
Again he put seven!

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:09.980
I mean, you would say such a great man to
waste energy on counting these stones.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:17.760
Was that he was saving his time: “one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, I’m there.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.960
Then I do next thing then."

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.359
So as far as this material world is concerned,
you have to be like a machine.

01:01:24.359 --> 01:01:33.510
As far as the spiritual life is concerned,
you have to be like an ocean.

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:37.109
Or like the energy.

01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:46.300
The machine has to be fixed and the energy
then flows better.

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.590
Do you see the two things?

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:58.859
The ocean of energy is at work and the machine
is perfect because it has consistent things.

01:01:58.859 --> 01:02:05.349
Supposing now the machine is made of two wires
here: supposing you suddenly take out one,

01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:06.619
it won’t work!

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:11.650
All these are fixed things as you understand
machines very well.

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:15.990
And all these fixed things can give you a
lot of saving of time.

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:18.540
While we try to save time, “I have no time."

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.540
Why?

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.550
“Because I was standing before the mirror
for about one hour."

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.550
Meditation we have no time.

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:23.980
Standing before a mirror for one hour!

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.170
“What were you doing before the mirror?”

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:37.609
“Trying to comb my hair,” For one hour!

01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:45.369
So where you spend so much time [it] could
be saved, so save time.

01:02:45.369 --> 01:02:49.300
For that you must know your priorities and
you must know your importance, that saving

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:53.859
time means saving time for our ascent.

01:02:53.859 --> 01:03:00.691
But in our daily life we do that, supposing
there’s, say, there’s a man, who has to

01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:05.450
manage some aeroplanes, what does he do?

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:10.510
He takes up his time in dressing up, sometimes
if he’s late, he just gets up, hurries up,

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:16.460
somehow or other gets into his cab or car
whatever it is, takes the fastest run and

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:22.460
jumps to the aeroplane, because he has to
carry the aeroplane, that’s his job.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:27.119
So his priority is not how many times he stands
before the mirror, combs his hair, but the

01:03:27.119 --> 01:03:29.500
priority is he must get to the aeroplane.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:38.060
That’s what should be with us also that:
how much time do we take to do all these nonsensical

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.060
things?

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:47.349
And how much time for the right things?

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:53.780
So priorities have to change and then you
will be surprised, you will have lots of time

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.680
to do many things.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.829
What is your priority?

01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:58.170
That is to be decided.

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:03.340
And in your wisdom you must know your priority
is your ascent because this chance you are

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.340
never going to get [again].

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:09.569
This a special chance, specially for you,
specially you are going to get it, and you

01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:14.420
have every possibility of going very high
in case you put your priorities right.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.890
So what is your priority?

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:20.760
Firstly.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.360
Saving time, now saving money.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.069
I have seen people, I shouldn’t say, but
having horrible experiences I’ve had about

01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:30.880
people how they waste their money.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:38.770
We have been going to India many a times,
and every time people come, they come just

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:39.920
like traders.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:46.460
And once it happened like this, to this extent
it went, that in Delhi I had reserved lot

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.110
of area for my chandeliers to come with the
Air India.

01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:54.200
I had paid for it, and I told them that let
them come with the Sahaja yogis.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:05:00.690
Because they can carry in the hand, I don’t
want it to be thrown away by your people if

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:01.690
I send it.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.319
They said, “Alright we’ll put them with
the Sahaja yogis."

01:05:03.319 --> 01:05:05.440
But I didn’t tell them chandeliers or anything,
but my things.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:10.319
The Sahaja yogis had so much of weight that
they covered all my area, everything, and

01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:13.799
still there was overweight, which was excused
by Air India.

01:05:13.799 --> 01:05:22.299
And all My chandeliers were left there high
and dry on the airport, nobody to even to

01:05:22.299 --> 01:05:24.490
pick them up.

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:28.940
And they came here with all these loaded things;
I don’t know where it has disappeared all

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:29.940
the things that they brought from there.

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.940
This is one of the things.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:36.750
But this, many a times has happened, things
like that.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:45.200
So where do you save your money?

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.440
Why can’t you save your money?

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:52.130
I have seen two persons like that, I’ll
say, one person who lived in my house.

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:55.230
He had food, he had shelter, he had everything
with him.

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:56.950
He didn’t have to spend anything.

01:05:56.950 --> 01:06:00.319
I was also paying him some money.

01:06:00.319 --> 01:06:03.690
He’s never had money all his life.

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:06.520
There’s another one who came and stayed,
who was same way.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.299
I never paid a money to him, he always had
money with him.

01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:12.299
He saved.

01:06:12.299 --> 01:06:13.349
I said, “How do you save?”

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:15.079
He said, “Mother, where do I spend?

01:06:15.079 --> 01:06:20.710
You spend for me, I eat my food here, I have
everything, I don’t have to pay rent, nothing,

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.230
I’m very nicely placed here.

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:29.460
Where do I spend all the money that comes
to me as a dole becomes a sort of a saving

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.520
for me?”

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:36.150
One person never had money and another person
saved lot of money.

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:38.089
What is the reason for that?

01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:41.930
Again the priorities.

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:48.500
So these bad habits that you have had before
for which you are spending money and all that,

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.500
must be saved.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.950
Now, alright, when we travel of course we
must pay for your travelling and staying and

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:55.099
food and all that, that’s a different point.

01:06:55.099 --> 01:07:04.470
But you must know we are going to have very
big problems of our own projects we are going

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:05.740
to have.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.160
I mean, we will need money for that.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.030
I’m not going to ask you people, but I know
money will come to Me.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:19.520
But first of all you don’t even have money
at all, because there’s no accounting, there’s

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.330
no proper understanding as to how much you
have, how much to spend, where to spend, what

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:23.330
to do.

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:34.780
And the money is just spent away like that.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:39.430
You must make a compartment of that money
also, because as a Mother I must tell you

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.150
everything.

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:45.500
See now, you give Me money supposing for something,
I make a compartment.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.470
You gave Me money in puja, I made a compartment,
this is puja money.

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:54.900
Alright, now this I have decided on My own,
I need not do, but I’ve decided that I’ll

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.140
buy silver out of it for you people because
silver is there and all this silver that I

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:00.210
gave you and also more I have to give you,
because you can’t have puja with a plastic,

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:01.839
alright, I have to give that silver.

01:08:01.839 --> 01:08:03.460
So that puja money can be used.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.040
So I have a compartment, I’ve written it
down.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.910
Each and every pai (paisa) I have written
it down.

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.859
I have made a compartment, this one for this
one for this one for this one.

01:08:12.859 --> 01:08:16.839
But you are so haphazard!

01:08:16.839 --> 01:08:28.299
You will never have money, because God knows
where you spend your money!

01:08:28.299 --> 01:08:33.243
So to understand that you must have proper
priorities, you have to do away with things,

01:08:33.243 --> 01:08:34.243
which are not needed.

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:41.819
Like I know of one Sahaja yogi, who used to
spend lot of money, and I said, “Where do

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:43.650
you spend your money?”

01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:48.870
He was very fond of Indian food, he used to
go to Indian restaurant every day.

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:50.029
Can you imagine?

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:55.130
One day it happened that we went to that Indian
restaurant, and the fellow recognised that

01:08:55.130 --> 01:09:00.420
fellow, because he was driving us and, “Oh,
how are you here today?” he said, “Why,

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.299
you didn’t come for the last five days?”

01:09:02.299 --> 01:09:06.020
I said, “Do you mean he comes here every
day?”

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.509
He said, “Yes, practically."

01:09:07.509 --> 01:09:10.489
We can’t afford to go to Indian restaurant.

01:09:10.489 --> 01:09:14.259
Every month maybe once in a while we have
to take some guests and all that and CP gets

01:09:14.259 --> 01:09:15.259
money for that.

01:09:15.259 --> 01:09:22.219
I don’t know how you can go to an Indian
restaurant, eat food in the restaurant.

01:09:22.219 --> 01:09:28.699
So, priorities are such that we waste our
money here, there, so we have no money.

01:09:28.699 --> 01:09:35.040
Then we try save money: we become ridiculous
sometimes about certain things, which are

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.259
something I can’t believe that Sahaja yogis
could be like that.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:43.020
So how can, they all are like beggars.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:47.949
Then how can beggars be generous, can they
be generous?

01:09:47.949 --> 01:09:48.949
They cannot.

01:09:48.949 --> 01:09:52.370
When you go to India, how Indians look after
you.

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.850
You have seen that.

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.330
They work so hard.

01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:57.190
You go to somebody’s house.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:10:01.010
They’ll give there best that they have in
the house to eat.

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:14.530
Last time, when it was the wedding thing – Warren
is another great, what should I say, a kingly

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:18.960
person; he wanted to give very expensive presents
to the people, who got married.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.960
Very expensive.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.889
Amounting to about 2000 rupees each, about.

01:10:23.889 --> 01:10:28.100
So, and also the hand things and all that
would have been about 25,000.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.369
I mean 2,500.

01:10:29.369 --> 01:10:35.730
So I told Warren, I said, “Warren, it’s
going to be too much,” alright, so I took

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:37.579
away 600 part out of it.

01:10:37.579 --> 01:10:38.690
600 I paid each.

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:44.690
Each person who got married I’ve paid 600
for each of them.

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:52.270
He asked all the Sahaja yogis, who were there
to pay 108 rupees, means £8.

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:54.949
For 54 marriages one rupee each.

01:10:54.949 --> 01:11:01.000
On that also I had complaints when I came
to London!

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:10.469
And Indian Sahaja yogis on their own collected
and gave 10,000 rupees to cover up the expenses.

01:11:10.469 --> 01:11:13.130
What is 108?

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:16.670
And then they grudged!

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:21.980
That’s the worst part of it!

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:23.989
When I came back, they grudged about it.

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:33.610
I just…you see, from sublime to ridiculous
I just felt – what am I to say?

01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:36.880
They sent a big delegation!

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.699
“Oh, that we were lynched!” and this and
that.

01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:42.351
So what, are you going to give 1p (£0.01)
to them or what?

01:11:42.351 --> 01:11:50.369
And if you are going for a wedding, won’t
you give some present to them?

01:11:50.369 --> 01:11:52.789
Why?

01:11:52.789 --> 01:12:00.120
Because you have to buy things for somebody
who is a relations of relations of relations

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.920
of relations.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.050
What is the need to oblige such a distant
personality?

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:08.620
What is your relationship?

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.130
Your relationship is with Sahaja yogis.

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:13.079
They are your brothers and sisters.

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:18.280
Really they are your own, whom you should
give presents at least on their wedding day,

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.749
if not otherwise.

01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:26.320
I don’t know otherwise if Sahaja yogis give
to anyone.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:32.030
But “My uncle’s mother’s brother’s
somebody’s somebody’s somebody, he has

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:38.880
asked me to buy this for him.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.110
So I’m taking."

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.289
So again the priorities are to be changed.

01:12:47.289 --> 01:12:50.939
Who are your brothers and who are your sisters?

01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:56.809
Who is your family, who is your Mother?

01:12:56.809 --> 01:13:01.449
It’s a matriarchal society.

01:13:01.449 --> 01:13:07.030
We have a Mother and we have Her children
and we are all related to each other.

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:10.099
Others are all others; we are one.

01:13:10.099 --> 01:13:18.810
But I have seen, even in discussions, people
have told Me, that Sahaja yogis will take

01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:26.219
the side of the new Sahaja yogis and fight.

01:13:26.219 --> 01:13:31.080
You all should support each other instead
of your taking the side of somebody third

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.080
person coming in.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:39.849
Suddenly you get attached to that person,
why?

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:46.650
So this is one of the special characteristics,
if we have got, we should try to understand.

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:51.139
If you cannot go, don’t go.

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:57.929
But if you go then you have to behave yourself.

01:13:57.929 --> 01:14:02.880
If you cannot afford, you should not do it.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.300
But if you can afford it, and if you have
to go there, then go, but don’t behave like

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:12.469
beggars that when we come back here, what
shocked Me that for these hundred and eight

01:14:12.469 --> 01:14:16.690
rupees I had to talk to people, I mean really
it shocked Me completely!

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:20.809
And I could pay that back, hundred and eight
is not much, to all of you.

01:14:20.809 --> 01:14:29.280
But it was so and the discussion was about
this.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.300
Alright, so one should not discuss this.

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:39.510
For your information, you know your Mother
has spent lot of money but I’ve never said

01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:41.369
that and no one knows how much I have spent.

01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:43.309
Even if you ask Gavin, he won’t be able
to say.

01:14:43.309 --> 01:14:44.309
Nobody.

01:14:44.309 --> 01:14:48.579
They know little bit here and little bit there
and Warren knows little bit there and somebody

01:14:48.579 --> 01:14:49.579
knows here.

01:14:49.579 --> 01:14:51.809
But not to be said.

01:14:51.809 --> 01:14:55.909
When you spend something you are not to tell.

01:14:55.909 --> 01:15:00.130
Just to be done quietly, sweetly, beautifully.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:04.159
But here it is – little thing like that
and to talk like that.

01:15:04.159 --> 01:15:09.449
I mean, I was really…you are saints, you
know you are saints, you are great people,

01:15:09.449 --> 01:15:15.699
you are evolved people, you are religious
leaders of tomorrow.

01:15:15.699 --> 01:15:19.519
What are you saying?

01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:22.860
What are you talking?

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:29.679
Just think of that: what is your position
in life?

01:15:29.679 --> 01:15:41.920
So saving labour, saving money and last of
all that we try to save everything for ourselves

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.769
– selfishness.

01:15:47.769 --> 01:15:52.139
Tremendous selfishness and we don’t see
it sometimes.

01:15:52.139 --> 01:15:58.139
So please try to understand that all this
material selfishness must end up into spiritual

01:15:58.139 --> 01:15:59.139
selfishness.

01:15:59.139 --> 01:16:06.139
If you are really selfish, then know the Self,
which is the source of everything, if you

01:16:06.139 --> 01:16:07.789
are really sensibly selfish.

01:16:07.789 --> 01:16:08.789
Are you?

01:16:08.789 --> 01:16:10.110
Then know that Self.

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:11.349
It gives you everything.

01:16:11.349 --> 01:16:16.169
And now you have opened the way, you have
come inside, now you are there, you are sitting

01:16:16.169 --> 01:16:17.169
here.

01:16:17.169 --> 01:16:18.169
What more do you want?

01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:19.169
I don’t understand.

01:16:19.169 --> 01:16:24.280
So, there are some good people, I’m not
saying there are not, there are many good

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.489
people, but those who are not, bring forth
all these things and they create, generate

01:16:29.489 --> 01:16:30.489
a situation.

01:16:30.489 --> 01:16:34.789
In such a thing, supposing in a discussion,
somebody starts, you should just say, “Shut

01:16:34.789 --> 01:16:35.789
up!

01:16:35.789 --> 01:16:36.789
We are saints.

01:16:36.789 --> 01:16:38.469
We are not to talk these things."

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:42.929
Say, if you meet some saints together, they
are sitting down.

01:16:42.929 --> 01:16:47.619
Will they discuss these things?

01:16:47.619 --> 01:16:50.289
Will they discuss these things?

01:16:50.289 --> 01:16:52.360
Will they talk about these things?

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.389
Think of it.

01:16:53.389 --> 01:16:54.429
You are saints.

01:16:54.429 --> 01:16:55.949
First of all know that you are all saints.

01:16:55.949 --> 01:16:58.079
Now, you are all saints now.

01:16:58.079 --> 01:17:00.369
What should you discuss?

01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:07.219
How we’ll spread Sahaja Yoga, how to talk
about God, how to work it out, how to release

01:17:07.219 --> 01:17:10.130
our energies for God’s work.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:14.619
This should be our main concern, isn’t it?

01:17:14.619 --> 01:17:17.900
I went to see Gagangan Maharaj.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:24.090
First of all, so he said, “I want to talk
to You only."

01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:25.541
He didn’t want to talk to Sahaja yogis.

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:35.719
So he asked Me, “So You came on the earth,
alright, but do You find us alright, are we

01:17:35.719 --> 01:17:38.520
capable enough to receive You?”

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:42.760
I mean, see the questions he asked Me.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:50.190
And then he says that, “What should we do
on this earth to make You comfortable?

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:59.219
What is needed to be done, because all the
way You have taken your incarnation here?”

01:17:59.219 --> 01:18:03.599
He talked to Me like this!

01:18:03.599 --> 01:18:04.599
I was amazed.

01:18:04.599 --> 01:18:06.489
Then he told his disciples, “Now this is
the Goddess sitting before you.

01:18:06.489 --> 01:18:07.489
What are you doing?

01:18:07.489 --> 01:18:08.489
Do Her puja.

01:18:08.489 --> 01:18:09.489
You do my puja.

01:18:09.489 --> 01:18:10.489
What’s the use of doing my puja?

01:18:10.489 --> 01:18:11.489
Do Her puja.

01:18:11.489 --> 01:18:12.489
Every bit of it."

01:18:12.489 --> 01:18:13.489
I was amazed at his reaction.

01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:14.489
That’s what we have to understand that we
are today…what’s it?

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:15.489
Yogi: No, I didn’t want the lamp to pass
smoke if the oil burned out.

01:18:15.489 --> 01:18:18.330
Shri Mataji: They are all burning alright?

01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:23.489
Yogi: Can someone pass me some oil?

01:18:23.489 --> 01:18:28.640
Shri Mataji: No, no, it’s burning alright.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.320
It will go on burning.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.739
Yogi: it’s going to burn out.

01:18:36.739 --> 01:18:39.679
Shri Mataji: Burn out?

01:18:39.679 --> 01:18:43.370
But still they are burning.

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:50.510
Do you know how long it has been burning without
oil?

01:18:50.510 --> 01:19:02.360
(laughter) I have seen it long time back!
(laughing)

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.900
So!

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:09.860
Now we come to a point, where we understand
ourselves from the ridiculous to the sublime

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.920
point.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.479
That we should not oscillate anymore.

01:19:13.479 --> 01:19:20.769
Let us fix our sublime thoughts one after
another.

01:19:20.769 --> 01:19:27.320
How we climb a mountain, fix one, then another
sublime thought.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.939
Let some sublime thought come into your mind,
“Oh that’s such a beautiful thought, alright,

01:19:31.939 --> 01:19:32.939
fix that up."

01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:33.939
Like that.

01:19:33.939 --> 01:19:37.139
Then another sublime thought – you are a
source of that!

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:41.340
Now another sublime thought, “Aaahhh that’s
great!

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:44.380
Hold on to that."

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:48.179
Like that you climb up.

01:19:48.179 --> 01:19:50.459
Through sublimity, sublime.

01:19:50.459 --> 01:19:51.459
Not degrading thoughts.

01:19:51.459 --> 01:19:56.960
But immediately if there is some degrading
argument or suggestion or some sort of…and

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.699
a big argument will start [with] everybody
sitting there.

01:20:00.699 --> 01:20:09.030
It’s even worse than what I find about these
BBC people now discussing on the table.

01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:12.249
Sometimes, can be very bad.

01:20:12.249 --> 01:20:18.440
So one has to understand that our priorities
are going to be very different from all others.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:27.329
For them ridiculous is important, for us sublime
is important.

01:20:27.329 --> 01:20:32.810
If anybody suggests anything like that, you
should say, “No that’s not sublime.

01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:35.239
No we can’t have it.

01:20:35.239 --> 01:20:37.190
Can’t talk with it.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:38.650
Just stop it!”

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:48.820
Let us see ourselves fully competing in achieving
sublime within us.

01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:53.409
You have assets, as I told you, that you are
born in this country of Sadashiva.

01:20:53.409 --> 01:20:57.230
You are the heart of the Universe.

01:20:57.230 --> 01:21:00.409
That you are special people to be born here.

01:21:00.409 --> 01:21:04.900
You had people like William Blake before you.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.760
See the vibrations!

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.669
Did he talk of anything ridiculous?

01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:16.079
Did he talk of anything nonsensical?

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:18.929
Did he grudge about money?

01:21:18.929 --> 01:21:22.349
Did he say anything about it?

01:21:22.349 --> 01:21:26.499
How he stood up and how he said and what he
propounded.

01:21:26.499 --> 01:21:29.050
He wants to create Jerusalem.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.610
Do we think like that?

01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:33.439
We have to create Jerusalem?

01:21:33.439 --> 01:21:37.989
Then how do we think all these ridiculous
things: talking, gossiping and saying things

01:21:37.989 --> 01:21:41.630
and not working out through meditation our
ascent.

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:48.329
I do not know how many more Sahaja yogis we
are going to get.

01:21:48.329 --> 01:21:52.939
Because maybe that after this might get only
donkeys, maybe I can’t say.

01:21:52.939 --> 01:21:58.019
Let us hope we get better people, let us hope.

01:21:58.019 --> 01:22:04.959
But whatever you are, you are going to determine
the image of the people who are going to come.

01:22:04.959 --> 01:22:14.820
That’s why I wanted to talk to you, today
specially, for this purpose that, we have

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:22.849
to learn that so much is still to be done
and Mother is going away now.

01:22:22.849 --> 01:22:32.519
If I go now, I’ll come back of course for
a short time but at the most two years more

01:22:32.519 --> 01:22:40.280
and then what?

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.769
We have to work hard to come up.

01:22:41.769 --> 01:22:45.489
These two years we have to all work very hard.

01:22:45.489 --> 01:22:47.969
Specially in the ashrams.

01:22:47.969 --> 01:22:55.050
I’ve told you about chastity – that’s
the first part of it.

01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:59.849
And there should be absolutely brothers and
sisters relationships among yourselves.

01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:03.639
Like a brother and sister never go and try
to please each other, do they?

01:23:03.639 --> 01:23:04.639
I mean this thing called flirt, what you call
flirting.

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:05.639
That, do they do?

01:23:05.639 --> 01:23:14.689
And that should go on in the ashrams and things.

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:20.330
It’s very wrong, I think it is very, very
wrong to do that way.

01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:33.309
This is an ashram of sages, sages, who have
taken their birth after ages.

01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:38.800
So sages must we worshipped like sages.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:44.650
You cannot dress up like a punk and become
a sage.

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:47.269
You cannot be like other people.

01:23:47.269 --> 01:23:58.139
A sage has a face, has an expression, has
eyes, his whole gait is different from others.

01:23:58.139 --> 01:24:03.409
He has confidence, as well as compassion.

01:24:03.409 --> 01:24:07.130
We have to see those images in you.

01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:10.780
Now so far is alright that we came to Sahaja
Yoga for our gain.

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.349
We are here now for the gain of others.

01:24:13.349 --> 01:24:17.519
We have gained whatever is possible, we don’t
want to gain any more.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.480
Now let us give this to others.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:24.329
For that we have to have an image, we have
to dress up in that way.

01:24:24.329 --> 01:24:29.840
For example I was the other day telling the…I
don’t think it maybe too much for you people

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:37.679
to believe that, but it’s a fact that it’s
the brain that is upset here.

01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:42.329
Heart is of course is frozen, but brain is
responsible.

01:24:42.329 --> 01:24:49.070
And I told them that every Saturday you must
rub your head with so much of oil, nicely.

01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:52.889
Every Saturday, Sunday you wash it off.

01:24:52.889 --> 01:24:59.929
But on the whole, the system that existed
before this, about twenty years back: all

01:24:59.929 --> 01:25:07.149
the English men used to have very nice combed
hair, I mean, they never had fluffy hair or

01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:08.149
anything.

01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:14.780
But I think since this hairdressing started,
people took to this kind of a thing, and it’s

01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.969
very dishevelled and funny.

01:25:15.969 --> 01:25:20.919
For a saint it should be properly dressed.

01:25:20.919 --> 01:25:25.499
There should be neatness about him.

01:25:25.499 --> 01:25:29.429
Untidiness is not a sign of a saint.

01:25:29.429 --> 01:25:34.719
You come and see My house, it’s very big,
I can not live with untidiness.

01:25:34.719 --> 01:25:38.909
If it’s temporarily, you are somewhere is
alright, but if you have to live somewhere

01:25:38.909 --> 01:25:40.469
you should be neat and tidy.

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:44.099
But it is not so.

01:25:44.099 --> 01:25:49.909
I have seen people grudging; supposing you
have gone to Brighton, Brighton people say

01:25:49.909 --> 01:25:54.630
they came here and went away even without
even putting the beds right.

01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:59.469
When they come, the same Brighton people,
when they come here to London, the London

01:25:59.469 --> 01:26:04.909
people tell Me that they came here, spoiled
everything, did not put anything right and

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:05.909
went away.

01:26:05.909 --> 01:26:12.289
So the attitude of spoiling others’ things
and not your own is wrong.

01:26:12.289 --> 01:26:15.050
You have to change that.

01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:25.599
On the whole one has to understand the appearance,
the living system is to be systematised, is

01:26:25.599 --> 01:26:32.090
to be systematised: so that you do not waste
your energy in establishing that system – which

01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:34.719
is not so important.

01:26:34.719 --> 01:26:44.219
And the unsystematic, which is the energy,
then works out better if you are systematised.

01:26:44.219 --> 01:26:54.229
So a kind of neatness, a kind of a system
in your life you should be there.

01:26:54.229 --> 01:27:02.179
I mean, I know of Gandhiji, he used to go
out for a walk and people could put their

01:27:02.179 --> 01:27:06.690
watches right by the time he used to walk,
the way he used to come and go and I…of

01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:09.959
course, you don’t need to be slave of the
watches, of course, that’s not the point

01:27:09.959 --> 01:27:19.409
I’m saying, again I have to say the other
thing, because you can go to

01:27:19.409 --> 01:27:20.429
the other extreme.

01:27:20.429 --> 01:27:21.429
Is that.

01:27:21.429 --> 01:27:29.349
As in the whole the western mind is very self-opinionated,
very self-opinionated, they don’t want to

01:27:29.349 --> 01:27:33.090
learn anything from anyone, they think they
are the best.

01:27:33.090 --> 01:27:38.729
Like they will go to somebody’s house, “I
don’t like it”, is not good.

01:27:38.729 --> 01:27:43.960
Or even an artist, say, say a person, who
is well-educated in art, they have not seen

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.809
the other world.

01:27:45.809 --> 01:27:53.519
So for them anything is a bit, sort of a funny
thing.

01:27:53.519 --> 01:28:00.479
As I told you the other day, when I went to
Brighton these people I talked to Brighton

01:28:00.479 --> 01:28:06.939
that in Brighton you have got such a beautiful
piece of art where Rajput art and Mughal art

01:28:06.939 --> 01:28:09.729
is combined together in that royal pavilion
outside, inside, they say, I have not seen

01:28:09.729 --> 01:28:10.729
the inside.

01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:19.829
But the description of that when I saw in
the tourist book was that, “It is bizarre,

01:28:19.829 --> 01:28:21.010
it’s absurd."

01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:31.499
[If] any one of them can make even one arch
like that, then I can understand.

01:28:31.499 --> 01:28:33.090
But to criticise, why?

01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:39.699
Because you can’t do it yourself.

01:28:39.699 --> 01:28:46.980
Because you can’t do it, then it is ‘bizarre’,
then it is bad.

01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.719
And this is much more in an English character
than anywhere else.

01:28:50.719 --> 01:28:55.059
They make everybody look very low compared
to them, always.

01:28:55.059 --> 01:29:02.340
Like some sahaja yoginis from abroad, I wanted
them to come to England, to be married, they

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.571
said, “Not in England Mother, we can’t
live there,” because they all look down

01:29:05.571 --> 01:29:06.571
upon them.

01:29:06.571 --> 01:29:11.189
Italians are frightened of you people, if
you ask Argentineans, they are frightened

01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:14.840
of you, Spanish are frightened of you.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:21.590
French, they say, “We are just the same
as they are – can’t go."

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:27.659
Austrians don’t want to come.

01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:33.909
Though you may not have vibrations, though
you may not be very good at realisation, you

01:29:33.909 --> 01:29:39.989
may not be anything, but you just put on a
hat and you become “say Big Bot”.

01:29:39.989 --> 01:29:43.059
You look down upon everyone, showing them
down.

01:29:43.059 --> 01:29:50.969
The best way to exist in this world, have
nothing, just try to show down a person, “You

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.090
are no good."

01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:57.729
It’s very surprising in Sahaja Yoga people
say that about English people that they don’t

01:29:57.729 --> 01:30:00.300
want to come to England, because everyone
looks down upon you.

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:05.760
You have developed a method of looking down
upon others, but what do you do, what do you

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.199
have.

01:30:07.199 --> 01:30:10.090
Let’s [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:12.439
Come to the brass tacks as they say in America.

01:30:12.439 --> 01:30:13.679
Let’s see.

01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:27.340
Can you sing as good as that [INAUDIBLE] that
fellow played the other day, can you do it?

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.939
Anyone of you in your generations?

01:30:31.939 --> 01:30:39.669
Can you build Taj Mahal, leave alone Ajanta?

01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:49.499
Can you make these rugs which Persians can
make?

01:30:49.499 --> 01:30:59.580
What have you shown of your merit that you
are boasting of?

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:05.219
You cannot make the embroidery, the women
here cannot.

01:31:05.219 --> 01:31:09.889
You cannot cook like us, can you?

01:31:09.889 --> 01:31:14.659
You cannot even make embroidery like the Spanish.

01:31:14.659 --> 01:31:17.050
You cannot make the furniture like the Italians,
can you?

01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:23.729
What can you do?

01:31:23.729 --> 01:31:27.369
What is the art you have produced?

01:31:27.369 --> 01:31:29.429
Constable?

01:31:29.429 --> 01:31:31.489
Turner?

01:31:31.489 --> 01:31:39.550
Alright, I respect them as artists, but are
they the topmost?

01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:43.429
Are they?

01:31:43.429 --> 01:31:46.439
Derek, you tell Me.

01:31:46.439 --> 01:31:47.439
You don’t think so.

01:31:47.439 --> 01:31:48.439
Alright.

01:31:48.439 --> 01:31:49.439
So now, what have we achieved so much that
we think no end of ourselves?

01:31:49.439 --> 01:31:54.199
Put the question to yourselves first of all.

01:31:54.199 --> 01:32:01.119
That we look down upon everyone like that
and think everybody is a stupid fool and you

01:32:01.119 --> 01:32:10.099
are the only cleverest person and even in
Sahaja Yoga you do the same thing.

01:32:10.099 --> 01:32:17.780
It’s not only ego, it’s the stupidity,
which tries to show off.

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:24.639
So this is the worst thing that has happened
to us, to our character, I tell you.

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:27.139
We have no humility of any kind.

01:32:27.139 --> 01:32:34.030
Anybody, who does not know the job, will always
behave like that.

01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:39.559
We don’t know Sahaja Yoga, we don’t know
how to give Realisation, we cannot understand

01:32:39.559 --> 01:32:44.170
anything what’s happening to another person,
but we are great Sahaja yogis playing around:

01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:47.010
“I say Big Bot,” again.

01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:50.989
That’s the way, is a serious matter.

01:32:50.989 --> 01:32:54.073
We have no business to look down upon anybody
else, but ourselves.

01:32:54.073 --> 01:32:55.073
What have we achieved?

01:32:55.073 --> 01:33:06.789
In Sahaja Yoga I must admit, with all due
respect to all of you: of all the people,

01:33:06.789 --> 01:33:12.320
of all the people, Australians are the best,
I must say.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:16.340
I’m sorry to say, but it is so.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:21.679
Practically every Australian is much more
sensitive, you can say.

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:28.920
They were the criminals, sent as criminals,
they are the children of criminals or whatever

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:32.400
you may call them.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:37.939
Then the second are Austrians.

01:33:37.939 --> 01:33:43.579
French are the last, I agree.

01:33:43.579 --> 01:33:49.719
But there is competition between English and
French, who is the last.

01:33:49.719 --> 01:33:56.659
They also look down upon everyone, the French.

01:33:56.659 --> 01:34:06.329
So now for you, I know we are very fond of
horse racing, so I’m putting you onto a

01:34:06.329 --> 01:34:07.329
race.

01:34:07.329 --> 01:34:08.329
You have to come up all of you.

01:34:08.329 --> 01:34:16.610
You can, because you have the greatest asset,
which no one has: that you are born in England,

01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:23.110
where people like William Blake was born.

01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:30.130
It was Bhairava himself who took birth.

01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:41.159
He could not take birth anywhere else, but
here He took birth – who described this

01:34:41.159 --> 01:34:46.679
house, who described My house, who has said
everything about Sahaja Yoga.

01:34:46.679 --> 01:34:50.030
And He said that, “Men of God will become
prophets and they will have powers to make

01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:51.030
others prophets."

01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:54.909
Have you become prophets now?

01:34:54.909 --> 01:34:56.649
The powers are not there.

01:34:56.649 --> 01:35:03.349
You can prophesise, [but] powers are not there
because you are lost in all these frivolous,

01:35:03.349 --> 01:35:04.979
stupid, nonsensical things.

01:35:04.979 --> 01:35:09.110
Mantras are not working, your prophetic powers
are not there.

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:11.439
Your Kundalini powers are not there.

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:13.340
Powers are not working.

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.270
Weak, weak instrument.

01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:17.209
Make it alright!

01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:18.499
Systematise it.

01:35:18.499 --> 01:35:25.340
You have the greatest advantage, I tell you,
you have the greatest advantage and that’s

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.860
why I called this meeting now.

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:35.010
I’ve been to this ashram so many times,
I have never been to any such ashram, I’ve

01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:36.580
lived here the most of My time.

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:39.959
Nowhere, nowhere in the world I’ve lived
like this.

01:35:39.959 --> 01:35:44.389
Australia, I’ve been there only thrice,
I think.

01:35:44.389 --> 01:35:47.679
And now things should not be taken for granted.

01:35:47.679 --> 01:35:52.760
Of course, spreading of Sahaja Yoga is important
but ascent is also very important.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:36:03.329
Let us now take a tapasya, a vow of tapasya,
let us do it as a tapasya, as a penance, all

01:36:03.329 --> 01:36:04.329
of you.

01:36:04.329 --> 01:36:09.709
Whether you are in the ashram or in the house.

01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:13.030
Those, who are in the house are also lost.

01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:14.030
They don’t drink, but they sleep.

01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:15.030
So what’s the use?

01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:16.949
So now let us all take it up as a tapasya.

01:36:16.949 --> 01:36:19.889
And don’t indulge into internal, nonsensical
politics.

01:36:19.889 --> 01:36:28.849
There are others, who are doing it for you,
don’t you worry!

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:29.849
Just develop your Self-awareness.

01:36:29.849 --> 01:36:32.519
And when I’m out in India, dedicate yourself.

01:36:32.519 --> 01:36:39.420
When I’m away from you – so-called ‘away’
– dedicate yourself to spread Sahaja Yoga

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.639
and to ascend.

01:36:41.639 --> 01:36:53.979
Ascend in a way that constructs the whole
Universe – construction.

01:36:53.979 --> 01:36:54.979
Construction power has to start from you.

01:36:54.979 --> 01:37:05.510
It’s a chakra of construction, which has
to work out through you.

01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:14.190
Anything that I have said should be taken
just as an advice to you for your betterment.

01:37:14.190 --> 01:37:15.380
Work it out!

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:17.820
Just listen to it and forget it.

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:18.860
It’s a medicine.

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.630
So please listen to it again and again.

01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:25.650
Try to follow it in your own life, in your
own life, not in others’!

01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:26.650
Mostly others think, “Oh She’s talking
of somebody else!”

01:37:26.650 --> 01:37:29.630
There’s a little hint, which Gavin wanted
Me to tell that you should not play about,

01:37:29.630 --> 01:37:45.459
and they don’t do normally, but still he
wanted Me to tell you that the money part

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:57.269
of it – you shouldn’t try to cheat Me,
in any way because we have seen some bad results

01:37:57.269 --> 01:37:58.269
very recently.

01:37:58.269 --> 01:37:59.269
So be careful on that.

01:37:59.269 --> 01:38:07.369
He wanted Me to tell you that one has to be
careful not to cheat Me.

01:38:07.369 --> 01:38:12.090
So may God bless you all.

01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:17.889
Shri Mataji: So what’s the problem of Cambridge?

01:38:17.889 --> 01:38:22.389
Where is Jim?

01:38:22.389 --> 01:38:25.329
What’s the problem?

01:38:25.329 --> 01:38:28.010
Yogi: Collectivity.

01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:35.710
Shri Mataji: Now, you are the collective or
your wife?

01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:50.219
Tell Me, who is the collective?

01:38:50.219 --> 01:39:02.809
Yogi: All the people in Cambridge, Mother.

01:39:02.809 --> 01:39:15.269
Shri Mataji: Derek (Lee), what do you have
to say?

01:39:15.269 --> 01:39:17.269
Shri Mataji: But why?

01:39:17.269 --> 01:39:18.269
What happened?

01:39:18.269 --> 01:39:20.269
It plays both ways.

01:39:20.269 --> 01:39:23.769
Alright, I say it plays both ways.

01:39:23.769 --> 01:39:26.719
Because you are the leader and they are there.

01:39:26.719 --> 01:39:33.149
It is your responsibility to see that you
do not try to correct them all the time!

01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:34.149
Alright?

01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:39.409
Now it is your responsibility to see that
you get yourselves corrected and see for yourselves

01:39:39.409 --> 01:39:40.409
that you are collective.

01:39:40.409 --> 01:39:41.499
It’s the way you handle.

01:39:41.499 --> 01:39:44.389
The art of a leader is the way he handles
situations.

01:39:44.389 --> 01:39:47.729
You being an American (Jim) should know better
how to handle.

01:39:47.729 --> 01:39:48.729
What’s the problem?

01:39:48.729 --> 01:39:52.110
And I tell you, your wife, she still catches
on ?.

01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:54.159
Do you meditate every day?

01:39:54.159 --> 01:39:55.209
Hilary: yes

01:39:55.209 --> 01:39:57.320
Shri Mataji: Do you?

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:58.320
Sure?

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.530
It is there, still catching, I can feel it.

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:16.300
Let us shift her from there, from Cambridge,
to some other place, to get herself corrected.

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:20.579
Isn’t she catching very badly?

01:40:20.579 --> 01:40:27.699
You have a problem that you feel that you
must take charge.

01:40:27.699 --> 01:40:36.639
All the wives of the leaders are not like
that, but some of them are like that.

01:40:36.639 --> 01:40:38.480
Like madam Cahndbai?

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.130
you can say, or Mrs.

01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:42.130
Mannar?

01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:43.130
or Mrs.

01:40:43.130 --> 01:40:50.929
Kennedy or we had another one, what’s her
name, this Indonesian one, horrible!

01:40:50.929 --> 01:41:04.139
They want to assert themselves as people,
who should control.

01:41:04.139 --> 01:41:10.000
Is it true Derek?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Not direct, indirect.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
You should try to correct her first.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.519
Because maybe it is having an effect on you
Jim, possibly.

01:41:14.519 --> 01:41:16.679
Do you understand My point?

01:41:16.679 --> 01:41:18.309
She is catching.

01:41:18.309 --> 01:41:20.479
I can tell you.

01:41:20.479 --> 01:41:22.719
She is catching, ask anyone.

01:41:22.719 --> 01:41:25.979
Right heart she has, left heart.

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:29.780
Anybody, who is sensitive, will say that.

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:33.520
Now best thing is, you must see her vibrations
first.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.142
You correct your wives, you correct your husbands
in a way to see the vibrations.

01:41:35.142 --> 01:41:40.449
Otherwise, unless and until you go all out
about it, you cannot work it out.

01:41:40.449 --> 01:41:45.280
They have a wife, they have a husband, all
this nonsense is there.

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.300
Just see to it that you clear it out completely.

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:53.320
I think she should shift to some other ashram
that would be better, and keep quiet.

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.999
You are not in charge, he’s in charge.

01:41:55.999 --> 01:42:00.599
It’s a very common thing they are having
this kind thing: the wife controlling.

01:42:00.599 --> 01:42:06.760
You know it happened in Australia, and we
had to send the wife away to Stratford, where

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.820
she changed.

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:12.040
Should we send her to Stratford.

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.880
You know how to cook or not as an American?

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.290
Well it’s alright.

01:42:19.290 --> 01:42:20.710
Send her somewhere.

01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:26.229
You must get alright because you influence
him and the whole thing goes out.

01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:27.760
Now Dennis, what’s your problem?

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.050
You try to find faults with him, do you?

01:42:31.050 --> 01:42:35.219
He tries to find faults with him.

01:42:35.219 --> 01:42:38.959
What’s the problem?

01:42:38.959 --> 01:42:43.239
What is the problem, you have to tell Me.

01:42:43.239 --> 01:42:45.199
Sahaja yogi: [inaudible].

01:42:45.199 --> 01:42:49.119
Shri Mataji: Alright, what is it?

01:42:49.119 --> 01:42:53.679
I mean, I say such a straightforward thing
I’m not such an intelligent woman, to say

01:42:53.679 --> 01:42:54.679
double-edged things.

01:42:54.679 --> 01:42:56.129
Now what is it, in what point?

01:42:56.129 --> 01:42:57.129
Let Me see.

01:42:57.129 --> 01:43:07.780
Sahaja yogi: Some of us, I understand Mother
that you say that we should win people through

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:12.269
love and tolerance.

01:43:12.269 --> 01:43:16.750
Shri Mataji: Alright.

01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:19.860
Sahaja yogi: And others understand that we
should make people see that there are certain

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.860
standards that they have to live up to, and
most people seem incompatible to us.

01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:21.860
Shri Mataji: It can be understood very well.

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:27.399
See, first supposing I give you a car and
you say, “Mother, you have said I have to

01:43:27.399 --> 01:43:28.780
drive, so I start driving."

01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:31.570
I don’t know how to drive, what’s the
use.

01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:33.489
See, people come to you in stages.

01:43:33.489 --> 01:43:35.530
Both the things are correct.

01:43:35.530 --> 01:43:39.079
First: “come on, come on, come on!”

01:43:39.079 --> 01:43:45.099
Give them food, give them this, that, “come
on, come on, come on."

01:43:45.099 --> 01:43:46.489
Be very nice.

01:43:46.489 --> 01:43:51.610
So-called protocol is to be done to them because
they are newcomers.

01:43:51.610 --> 01:43:52.610
Alright?

01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:57.919
Need not immediately tell them the whole thing!

01:43:57.919 --> 01:43:58.919
Alright?

01:43:58.919 --> 01:43:59.919
Let them come.

01:43:59.919 --> 01:44:05.690
When they are nicely settled down then you
let them experience the joy, so they hanker

01:44:05.690 --> 01:44:06.690
after you.

01:44:06.690 --> 01:44:10.999
Now I have said so many things today to you,
which I didn’t say before twelve years back.

01:44:10.999 --> 01:44:16.550
Say, if I had said twelve years back, do you
think Gavin would have stuck onto Me?

01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:26.590
Ask Gavin, how they troubled Me, seven of
them; all troubled Me such a lot.

01:44:26.590 --> 01:44:31.469
I was very patient and kind and affectionate
and nice.

01:44:31.469 --> 01:44:36.119
And then, when they became Sahaja yogis, now
I said, “Come along now."

01:44:36.119 --> 01:44:40.721
Then they started asking, “What should we
do to improve ourselves Mother, how should

01:44:40.721 --> 01:44:41.721
we clarify?”

01:44:41.721 --> 01:44:42.721
So now, which side are you, on the love side
or on the correction side?

01:44:42.721 --> 01:44:43.721
How do you interpret it?

01:44:43.721 --> 01:44:46.159
How do you interpret Me?

01:44:46.159 --> 01:44:49.099
What do you think?

01:44:49.099 --> 01:44:51.800
What did I say?

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.889
Derek?

01:44:52.889 --> 01:44:59.440
Derek: We have to be both.

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.709
Shri Mataji: No!

01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:04.899
Not simultaneously!

01:45:04.899 --> 01:45:09.439
Imagine you call somebody for food and hit
at the same time!

01:45:09.439 --> 01:45:16.239
First with love.

01:45:16.239 --> 01:45:26.300
Let them come in and then.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:37.300
It took Me four years to make these seven
great English Sahaja yogis to settle down.

01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:40.189
There’s one sitting there, ask him.

01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:47.679
They used to come into my house, I would cook
for them, I would do this and I started an

01:45:47.679 --> 01:45:53.260
ashram and did that and gave them everything.

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:56.750
Matt, what do you say?

01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:06.479
So, in the beginning you have to do that.

01:46:06.479 --> 01:46:11.519
I told Gregoire very recently: with Germans
he went and he just told them off!

01:46:11.519 --> 01:46:12.519
And ?

01:46:12.519 --> 01:46:17.769
was upset that, because Gregoire said something,
they all ran away!

01:46:17.769 --> 01:46:24.149
So of course I took the side of Gregoire,
because I didn’t want to let him down, but

01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:27.739
I said that, alright, such runaways are there,
what can you do?

01:46:27.739 --> 01:46:33.130
But with Germans I don’t have much hopes,
I have great hopes from English.

01:46:33.130 --> 01:46:41.030
Actually that’s why, to My program I have
not seen there was any problem, if it is Mataji’s

01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:51.510
program, the whole hall will be filled and
then next day all the birds run away.

01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:52.829
What’s the matter?

01:46:52.829 --> 01:46:58.130
So we have to use, first of all, very gentle
methods, very, very gentle.

01:46:58.130 --> 01:47:01.789
That’s the style your Mother has.

01:47:01.789 --> 01:47:04.070
When you came first to Me, how did I talk
to you?

01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:06.729
Did I say all these things to you?

01:47:06.729 --> 01:47:10.460
If I had said that, “An Englishman, you
could be sarcastic,” you would have gone

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:11.460
away the next day!

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:16.059
Today I can say, because you know that, because
no more Englishman exists there, it is finished

01:47:16.059 --> 01:47:19.249
now, you are a Sahaja yogi.

01:47:19.249 --> 01:47:24.329
And you would like to improve yourselves,
so If I say anything you wouldn’t mind,

01:47:24.329 --> 01:47:25.329
isn’t it?

01:47:25.329 --> 01:47:26.329
That’s what it is.

01:47:26.329 --> 01:47:27.329
So one should not do both the things.

01:47:27.329 --> 01:47:29.840
First, just love: affection, give them food
to eat, vibrated food, vibrated salt, this,

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:30.840
that, try to look after them even physical
side.

01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:31.840
Then, then gradually you have to tell them,
“Yes I don’t feel vibrations.

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:32.840
You feel left Mooladhara, what does that mean
– how to tell.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:33.840
Very difficult, you know, it’s a funny thing.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.840
But you better grow a little bit then we tell
you."

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.520
Keep the curiosity on.

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:47.969
Left Mooladhara is a dangerous thing, it’s
a very bad thing to happen to anyone, left

01:47:47.969 --> 01:47:55.780
Mooladhara, and on top of that now you are
catching on left Swadhishthana!

01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:57.909
So what is that?

01:47:57.909 --> 01:48:01.090
It’s another one, it’s very difficult.

01:48:01.090 --> 01:48:08.329
Now, among yourselves you should say, “What
to do with his left Mooladhara?

01:48:08.329 --> 01:48:19.230
Alright let us see, let us see the mantra,
ourselves."

01:48:19.230 --> 01:48:23.860
You form a group yourselves and show complete
attention to him that you are concerned, “Now

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:26.989
where is it, oh it’s on the way."

01:48:26.989 --> 01:48:30.539
Talk in the third person.

01:48:30.539 --> 01:48:32.559
“Where is the Kundalini now?

01:48:32.559 --> 01:48:33.559
On the left Nabhi."

01:48:33.559 --> 01:48:36.449
Now immediately you’ll go and ask, “Are
you alright with your wife?”

01:48:36.449 --> 01:48:37.449
finished!

01:48:37.449 --> 01:48:38.449
Why should you ask?

01:48:38.449 --> 01:48:39.869
I say because it’s a common thing.

01:48:39.869 --> 01:48:43.920
Like one fellow came and asked Me, “Mother,
what’s wrong with these people, they are

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.860
all saying, ‘What’s wrong with your father?”

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:46.860
I said, “Really?

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:47.860
Nothing wrong with your father?”

01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:48.860
“No Mother.

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:51.329
There is problem between me and him, but I
would not like to discuss it openly."

01:48:51.329 --> 01:48:53.149
I said, “Correct.

01:48:53.149 --> 01:49:02.249
Alright, but they should not say, see they
know everything that’s what I tell you,

01:49:02.249 --> 01:49:05.169
but you better know also about it."

01:49:05.169 --> 01:49:07.939
Like that I talked to him.

01:49:07.939 --> 01:49:09.979
But you need not say, “What about your father?”

01:49:09.979 --> 01:49:12.979
I’ve seen people, when they gave Realisation,
suddenly they’ll ask a question like this.

01:49:12.979 --> 01:49:13.979
No!

01:49:13.979 --> 01:49:21.630
You should just talk on Kundalini, “It’s
not here, It has to move, It has to go, It

01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:22.630
has to do."

01:49:22.630 --> 01:49:26.659
Then you come down, gradually, alright.

01:49:26.659 --> 01:49:31.699
We have to be tricky people, Shri Krishna.

01:49:31.699 --> 01:49:39.460
Otherwise, how are you going to tame these
great Englishmen into your fold?

01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:43.400
They are not fishermen which Christ caught.

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:51.949
They are Englishmen, you must know, this also
shakes with that name.

01:49:51.949 --> 01:49:55.539
So be careful when you handle them.

01:49:55.539 --> 01:49:58.379
I said the art lies in that, alright James?

01:49:58.379 --> 01:50:04.409
So now I tell also as a leader that you should
see that you combine them beforehand, you

01:50:04.409 --> 01:50:09.499
must have a meeting before they come in, “How
we are going to handle them, how we are going

01:50:09.499 --> 01:50:12.080
to make them come inside.

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:16.980
Let us have a proper net spread, so you say
something and I say something.

01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:22.789
Let them feel that we are understanding it.

01:50:22.789 --> 01:50:30.320
That somebody can say like this, “Oh,”
and then another one should say, “Left Vishuddhi."

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.570
No, no, no.

01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:38.719
You don’t ask a person, “You feel guilty?”
you should say, “One should not feel guilty

01:50:38.719 --> 01:50:42.119
much in this,” in a third person talking.

01:50:42.119 --> 01:50:44.939
Then the person might say, “Yea, I feel
very guilty,” you say, “What is there

01:50:44.939 --> 01:50:46.989
to feel guilty?”

01:50:46.989 --> 01:50:48.059
Then it’s alright.

01:50:48.059 --> 01:50:55.239
But if you just say, “You feel guilty?”,
they say, “Yes, I feel guilty."

01:50:55.239 --> 01:50:59.139
People are very funny, I must say.

01:50:59.139 --> 01:51:02.010
Like in San Francisco they said that, “We
want to destroy ourselves, why do you want

01:51:02.010 --> 01:51:03.480
to save us?”

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.760
Now what do you say after that?

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.809
I say, “Alright, I’m sorry."

01:51:08.809 --> 01:51:13.320
People are very queer all over, they have
become strange people.

01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:15.780
All possessed, all up side down.

01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:20.969
See, like I feel two belts are moving, one
is moving upward, one is moving downward with

01:51:20.969 --> 01:51:22.629
a great, tremendous people.

01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:24.949
We are on this one, which is going upward.

01:51:24.949 --> 01:51:27.039
We have to pull out people from the other
belt.

01:51:27.039 --> 01:51:30.099
You see, they are moving together, trying
to pull them.

01:51:30.099 --> 01:51:31.329
But what is happening?

01:51:31.329 --> 01:51:33.749
They are moving downward, we are moving upward.

01:51:33.749 --> 01:51:38.179
So what we have to do, is to somehow or the
other to station ourselves in such a way that

01:51:38.179 --> 01:51:40.309
they feel we are stationary and we pull them.

01:51:40.309 --> 01:51:47.159
Otherwise, if you think that this is [inaudible],
then they think that, “Oh, these think no

01:51:47.159 --> 01:51:49.960
end of themselves, they are pressurising."

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:55.930
Here they have mentally found out many things,
like – nobody should pressurise you, nobody

01:51:55.930 --> 01:52:03.030
should condition you, nobody should give you
ideas.

01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:09.380
So just talk on Kundalini – in a third person
– then you will get them.

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:10.380
Always I had a big group coming to see Me.

01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:12.659
But the second one will be less and second
will be less, because as soon as they see

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:17.859
the Sahaja yogis, half of them drop out.

01:52:17.859 --> 01:52:23.109
Not that they are very good people, they drop
out, because they have to be dropped out,

01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:26.169
doesn’t matter, but we should try.

01:52:26.169 --> 01:52:30.260
They cannot not be of your quality, naturally.

01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:36.389
Alright, so let us develop a very logical,
sensible discretion about it.

01:52:36.389 --> 01:52:46.359
Sahaja yogi: Things will get better in Cambridge,
Mother.

01:52:46.359 --> 01:52:52.129
Shri Mataji: Of course.

01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:55.939
You have to be good salesmen.

01:52:55.939 --> 01:53:03.300
There are few words like this, you must say”
thank you, sir, of course”.

01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:08.739
“Of course”, we’ll say, “Is it so”,
“Of course”, or something.

01:53:08.739 --> 01:53:13.139
“Of course” in a good way.

01:53:13.139 --> 01:53:18.179
If they say, “Can we get cured?”, “Of
course, why not”.

01:53:18.179 --> 01:53:19.179
Like that.

01:53:19.179 --> 01:53:25.320
Anything like that if you say, positiveness
of yours, they will be happy.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:41.800
Alright, so now what is another problem; now
you, please, see that you go somewhere and

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:43.579
work it out.

01:53:43.579 --> 01:53:48.940
Cambridge must grow, Cambridge must grow,
it’s very important.

01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:55.229
This is no discussion needed, nothing, to
understand Me is the easiest thing.

01:53:55.229 --> 01:54:05.469
You don’t sit down and take out every hair
of Mine and split it.

01:54:05.469 --> 01:54:08.630
Develop your own discretion.

01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:15.139
I’m a Mahamaya, you know, if you go into
that kind of a trip, you’ll never end it.

01:54:15.139 --> 01:54:18.939
Don’t analyse Me at all, be gross about
it.

01:54:18.939 --> 01:54:23.159
Whatever you hear, “Alright, this is, Mother
has said it.

01:54:23.159 --> 01:54:24.159
Alright."

01:54:24.159 --> 01:54:25.159
Do it!

01:54:25.159 --> 01:54:26.159
Finished!

01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:27.159
Don’t analyse.

01:54:27.159 --> 01:54:28.159
If you go to analysis, you lose the synthesis
that has been created.

01:54:28.159 --> 01:54:29.919
You should not analyse anything.

01:54:29.919 --> 01:54:33.789
Whatever I say, “Alright, this is what Mother
has said.

01:54:33.789 --> 01:54:34.789
Alright."

01:54:34.789 --> 01:54:39.359
I’m not contradictory.

01:54:39.359 --> 01:54:43.530
I don’t contradict myself, do I?

01:54:43.530 --> 01:54:46.030
Then it’s alright.

01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:50.949
But listen to my lecture; every word and word
if you try to split it, you will get nowhere.

01:54:50.949 --> 01:54:51.949
They are mantras.

01:54:51.949 --> 01:54:57.150
Every word is a mantra, whatever I say is
a mantra.

01:54:57.150 --> 01:54:58.150
In fact.

01:54:58.150 --> 01:55:04.980
I won’t use a particular word at a particular
time, if it doesn’t fit into the mantra.

01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:08.639
Even My movements; you know, the whole Universe
moves with this, you know that very well.

01:55:08.639 --> 01:55:10.199
So, everything has a great meaning.

01:55:10.199 --> 01:55:19.119
So you just don’t go and try to split Me
and to understand Me intelligently.

01:55:19.119 --> 01:55:20.900
You cannot!

01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:23.570
Nobody can understand.

01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:32.570
I have no intelligence, to such an extent
that I am beyond your intelligence.

01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:34.879
I am beyond.

01:55:34.879 --> 01:55:37.780
You don’t try to split Me into words, into
thing.

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:39.989
That’s not…you can’t do it.

01:55:39.989 --> 01:55:44.229
Whatever I’ve said it, you take it, put
it down.

01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:45.229
Alright.

01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:46.229
Now, any other problem, any other thing you
have, you tell Me.

01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:47.229
Yes, doctor?

01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:48.229
Sahaja yogi: [INAUDIBLE] without the outcome
coming arrogant, as You have described the

01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:55.670
English as being.

01:55:55.670 --> 01:56:10.629
Could You explain what the sense of real word
involves?

01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:14.869
Shri Mataji: Now let’s see from where the
word comes.

01:56:14.869 --> 01:56:19.959
First of all let’s see the origin of the
word.

01:56:19.959 --> 01:56:30.309
Origin of the word is paravani, that’s called
as paravani, is beyond the sound, beyond the

01:56:30.309 --> 01:56:31.309
sound, paravani, the energy.

01:56:31.309 --> 01:56:37.239
Energy of sound is called as paravani, alright?

01:56:37.239 --> 01:56:39.219
This paravani is represented within us in
our stomach, is there.

01:56:39.219 --> 01:56:48.530
It is in the stomach first of all.

01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:51.769
And then it ascends gradually from stomach.

01:56:51.769 --> 01:57:04.929
It is the part where it starts throbbing,
supposing somebody has a cancer for the stomach,

01:57:04.929 --> 01:57:10.340
then you can feel the throbbing in that area.

01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:14.429
You want to find out if somebody has a cancer
in the stomach, you put your finger in this

01:57:14.429 --> 01:57:17.739
and you find a throbbing coming away.

01:57:17.739 --> 01:57:21.849
Of course it is not vice versa also that if
there is throbbing there is cancer!

01:57:21.849 --> 01:57:26.829
But if there is cancer invariably there has
to be throbbing.

01:57:26.829 --> 01:57:30.520
There has to be no throbbing in the stomach.

01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:36.859
If there is throbbing then that means: there
is something wrong with us.

01:57:36.859 --> 01:57:44.479
So first the obstruction takes place through
that paravani in the stomach and that is how

01:57:44.479 --> 01:57:51.139
this obstruction there makes the sound, “lap,
dap lap, dap, lap, dap."

01:57:51.139 --> 01:57:52.139
Alright.

01:57:52.139 --> 01:57:56.289
Then it rises higher into the heart.

01:57:56.289 --> 01:58:04.099
Into the heart the same sound becomes audible.

01:58:04.099 --> 01:58:07.269
When it becomes audible, when you start hearing
it.

01:58:07.269 --> 01:58:21.149
That happens because that energy makes the
heart pump, and that pumping makes the sound.

01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:27.030
But is anahat, is the one, which is without
the percussion.

01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:29.289
Then the same sound, energy, goes in the Vishuddhi
Chakra.

01:58:29.289 --> 01:58:37.610
When it goes to the Vishuddhi Chakra, then
it is pashyanti, it is the one that sees,

01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:40.329
[INAUDIBLE] here [INAUDIBLE] here it is [INAUDIBLE].

01:58:40.329 --> 01:58:42.649
Pashyanti means “it sees”.

01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:45.309
It sees that sound.

01:58:45.309 --> 01:58:46.969
Just sees.

01:58:46.969 --> 01:58:54.409
Means: if there is any sound anywhere, it
sees that, it knows, it sees.

01:58:54.409 --> 01:58:58.769
It’s the witness state of the sound here.

01:58:58.769 --> 01:59:06.359
And on this sound only you have seen how animals,
everybody lives with that sound, act with

01:59:06.359 --> 01:59:07.550
that sound.

01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:14.729
Say, an animal, supposing there’s one type
of a sound, is going on, “tap, tap, tap,”

01:59:14.729 --> 01:59:17.889
continuously – it knows everything is fine.

01:59:17.889 --> 01:59:23.169
But if there’s any change, it knows there’s
a change.

01:59:23.169 --> 01:59:28.389
So the sound at Vishuddhi, it becomes a pashyanti,
means the one that sees.

01:59:28.389 --> 01:59:41.309
Any sound comes, we immediately start seeing.

01:59:41.309 --> 01:59:44.320
It acts [inaudible].

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:54.199
Any sound, so it is in the pashyanti state.

01:59:54.199 --> 01:59:58.169
But then it becomes vaikhari, in the sound
box.

01:59:58.169 --> 01:59:59.530
Vaikhari means it speaks.

01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:04.260
So now, it comes from paravani, madhyama,
here, then it becomes pashyanti and then it

02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:05.260
becomes vaikhari, which speaks.

02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:06.260
Alright.

02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:10.689
So when it speaks, then it is modulated by
many things that is, it is all connected with

02:00:10.689 --> 02:00:11.689
brains.

02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:13.449
We are connected to the brain.

02:00:13.449 --> 02:00:22.479
The brain has two sides: one is the conditioning
and other is the ego.

02:00:22.479 --> 02:00:28.610
And these two sides act on the Vishuddhi as
you know that here first crossing takes place

02:00:28.610 --> 02:00:30.329
at this [inaudible].

02:00:30.329 --> 02:00:36.880
So at Vishuddhi, if you have a right side
Vishuddhi, you are arrogant, you are blunt,

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:41.169
you say things just like that without feeling
what another person is going to feel about

02:00:41.169 --> 02:00:43.239
it, how he is going to react or anything.

02:00:43.239 --> 02:00:44.239
Why?

02:00:44.239 --> 02:00:46.250
I ask the question.

02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:56.469
In the centre resides Shri Krishna, and Shri
Krishna is madhurya, is sweetness.

02:00:56.469 --> 02:01:03.889
Because you have diverted yourself from there,
you become harsh.

02:01:03.889 --> 02:01:08.019
On the left hand side is the Vishnumaya, is
the power.

02:01:08.019 --> 02:01:13.699
Right side is Vitthala, “tha, tha”, like
they say in [INAUDIBLE] speech, what we use

02:01:13.699 --> 02:01:21.859
in the most of Sanskrit language they’ll
say that when you have to describe the [INAUDIBLE]

02:01:21.859 --> 02:01:27.329
of war, if you have to describe the war, you
have to use “tha, tha, tha”.

02:01:27.329 --> 02:01:29.599
These are the things, “tha, tha”.

02:01:29.599 --> 02:01:34.760
The Vitthala, Vitthala, Vitthala as you say
here.

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:42.190
This “tha,” is the sign that [inaudible]
also Indian language or even Sanskrit language

02:01:42.190 --> 02:01:49.439
is like we say, have to [INAUDIBLE] hit somebody,
“thakkar” all these words we use.

02:01:49.439 --> 02:01:55.309
So the language is phonetic as well as expressive.

02:01:55.309 --> 02:02:01.289
So what happens that on the right side you
become “tha, tha, dha, na”, speak like

02:02:01.289 --> 02:02:02.289
that.

02:02:02.289 --> 02:02:04.349
Left side is Vishnumaya.

02:02:04.349 --> 02:02:11.690
Vishnumaya is the one is the accumulation
of the clouds and when they rock, you get

02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:14.949
the Vishnumaya, is the electricity.

02:02:14.949 --> 02:02:22.820
So it comes like a electrical thing, so [inaudible]
what you call the sarcasm.

02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:28.239
It is accumulation of all these conditionings
within us that will suddenly come up.

02:02:28.239 --> 02:02:38.999
So
these two reactions take place of this energy,

02:02:38.999 --> 02:02:45.129
which is here as “dha”, “dha”.

02:02:45.129 --> 02:02:50.570
Can you say it?

02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:56.019
Is a mild “tha”.

02:02:56.019 --> 02:03:15.280
So this “dha” that is within us is to
be used as an indication of our sweetness,

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.630
gentleness.

02:03:16.630 --> 02:03:22.179
But some people who are gentle by force, they
are forced to be gentle, then suddenly they

02:03:22.179 --> 02:03:24.859
come up as with Vishnumaya.

02:03:24.859 --> 02:03:29.019
You see, they have be normally gentle, alright,
and very kind, very nice this and that.

02:03:29.019 --> 02:03:31.079
Then you crack at a point.

02:03:31.079 --> 02:03:37.170
When you crack, then you say something sarcastic
or you may use right side also, but mostly

02:03:37.170 --> 02:03:41.349
it’s sarcastic, because that’s how you
give an outlet to your conditionings.

02:03:41.349 --> 02:03:47.899
So that’s how these two things happen, alright.

02:03:47.899 --> 02:04:01.469
But in the centre is [inaudible], think of
Shri Krishna, of His childhood, what pranks

02:04:01.469 --> 02:04:02.639
He used to play.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:04.400
How sweet He was, how He used to play with
the mother, how He stole the butter.

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:10.000
And that’s why He said butter is the solution,
ghee is the solution for making your sound

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.960
sweet, your talking sweet you have to be like
butter.

02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:21.000
There’s a Sanskrit couplet, beautiful, not
really Sanskrit, but it translates like this,

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:33.200
“Some people say that a saint’s heart
is like butter, but butter melts when it is

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:39.580
heated, but a saint’s heart melts when others
are heated."

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.800
So you are saints.

02:04:55.100 --> 02:05:01.780
So to be in the centre here that’s the best
way.

02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:08.200
And I must say Vishuddhi is a big, big, big
problem in England.

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.940
Especially left Vishuddhi is so much.

02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:15.000
You know I get such terrible pains all over
with left Vishuddhi.

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:22.840
So one should talk very sweetly.

02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:25.000
Now, who promises Me that?

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.860
Let Me see the hands.

02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:30.020
You are promising Me, alright?

02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:30.940
You are promising Adi Shakti!

02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:31.840
Remember that.

02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:32.340
Be careful!

02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:37.500
Right hand, better put up right hand.

02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:44.240
Thank you.

02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:46.140
May God bless you.
