00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:09.918
You are singing so beautifully.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.918
It seems your heart has opened after this Puja very much

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:31.292
and you’re singing like small children now.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.584
So sort of, all the conditionings we have had, all the ego also there,

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:52.667
it seems now you have become very pure all these problems have gone away

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:05.292
and you are enjoying yourselves.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.792
This is the best way, when we love ourselves,

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:17.000
we know ourselves we become love.

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:35.459
Because of so many pressures on us and so many norms we’ve got,

00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:45.918
which are artificial,

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:53.709
and we think only if outside we are alright, it’s alright;

00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:07.792
but truth flowing from within is so joyous.

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.125
You feel your capacity to love itself is so joyous,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:30.584
and capacity to give is also so joyous.

00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:44.459
So the Shiva Puja meant that you become love and feel the joy of love.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.375
You see when you love someone, if you love your child,

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.792
you’re not bothered as to how it looks or how it appears,

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:09.500
you just love.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:26.042
And if you try to be attentive to somebody because his appearance is good

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:29.918
or he’s superficially good, or his manners are good,

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.918
after some time you’ll be deceiving yourself.

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:51.626
But if your inner being is beautiful

00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:57.876
then you will be happy with yourself first of all;

00:04:06.334 --> 00:04:10.083
because the source of joy is from within yourself.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.375
You do not get it from others.

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:28.209
So to cleanse yourself and to be open is the best way to enjoy life.

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:42.834
Some people may laugh at you, some may make fun of you,

00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:44.999
some may try to trouble you;

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.083
but most of them will love you, because you are so pure,

00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:05.000
and you will be yourself at peace with yourself.

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:16.334
So the best thing is to have introspection to see yourself,

00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:18.584
whether you are love or not.

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:32.959
Like some people are conditioned

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.500
and they want that this should be like this that should be like this,

00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:40.626
it should have been there, we should do this we should do that,

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:54.459
we should organise like this, we should cook like this;

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:59.667
I mean conditionings are there that according to them that’s something good.

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:11.876
And if that doesn’t happen then they are unhappy.

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:25.999
And some are right sided egoistical, they want to dominate others,

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:29.792
if they cannot dominate then they are unhappy, they are angry.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.375
So they are miserable,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.459
so they make others miserable also.

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:57.125
So the first type which is left sided makes himself miserable,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.626
while the second type makes others miserable.

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:13.626
But both are wrong.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.375
You have no business to make yourself miserable,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
because God has created you to be joyous and happy.

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:42.292
So one should only know that you have to be the Spirit.

00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:52.834
So all these conditionings will drop out, ego will drop out.

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:04.792
But when we talk of Spirit we always think of something very dry.

00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:20.709
No it’s not at all, it is absolutely Love, Spirit is Love.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.209
You can say the light of Spirit is Love.

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:38.918
So it is important to understand that it’s the love only

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.792
that is emitting from your heart that will give joy to you.

00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:58.834
Look at other people as you have to give them love.

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:14.083
You’ll feel very powerful and the ‘bhoots’ and all the ‘badhas’ will run away.

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:26.125
Once you decide that I have to just love others,

00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:35.542
all the conditioning will drop out.
