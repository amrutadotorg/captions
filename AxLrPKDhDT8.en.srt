1
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,729
Today we are going to worship the Hamsa Chakra.

2
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:23,970
So far we have been always worshipping a Deity
and this is the second time you are worshipping

3
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,399
this centre of Hamsa.

4
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:43,310
Now this chakra is, it is, you know, placed
between the two eyebrows and two eyes represent

5
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:50,299
the left and the right side.

6
00:01:50,299 --> 00:02:08,950
So this centre is very much guided by our
eyes, by our ears, by our nose, tongue, teeth,

7
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,220
throat.

8
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:20,780
Is a very important centre because the Vishuddhi,
which has to look after sixteen petals, which,

9
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:29,700
sixteen petals, which look after all these
ear, nose, throat, different, different organs

10
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:38,090
within us, also it has to communicate with
the Viraat.

11
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:46,660
So it has to pass through this centre of Hamsa
Chakra.

12
00:02:46,660 --> 00:03:08,680
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal centre, which
expresses auspiciousness in our awareness.

13
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:17,959
That means, if this centre is alert and awakened,
then we immediately know what is auspicious

14
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:25,190
and what is not auspicious, or we can call
it, we get the Divine Discretion.

15
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:45,920
I think it is a part of the genetics that
people have discretion between good and bad,

16
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,700
destructive and constructive.

17
00:03:50,700 --> 00:04:06,950
It is basically, has to be there, but we can
easily spoil it by all these organs which

18
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:14,380
are collecting the conditionings and the ego
from outside.

19
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,239
That’s why this centre is very vulnerable.

20
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:28,030
Other centres are not so much connected outside
as this centre is connected, and receives

21
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,229
all the information from, all these organs.

22
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,260
For example, the eyes, now, we have.

23
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:45,669
Eyes are very important because, they say
it, this is the window of the Spirit.

24
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:53,000
And you have seen that when Kundalini rises,
and Spirit starts shining, there is a dilatation

25
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,020
of the pupils and you look like an innocent
child and there’s a twinkle in your eyes.

26
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:09,340
But the way that we play with our eyes all
the time, the way we use it indiscreetly with

27
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:17,919
our lust and greed we can spoil this centre
very badly.

28
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:33,930
Once we start taking to destructive things
in our life, we immediately become akin, or

29
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:42,400
we start accepting, whatever is wrong, whatever
is destructive, very easily.

30
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,620
I feel this is some sort of a genetic defect
because, in certain people, they will not

31
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,939
accept anything that is stupid, idiotic or
destructive.

32
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:06,250
But in certain people they’re very prone
and very easily can be taken to things which

33
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:14,210
are absurd, which are stupid and which are
definitely destructive.

34
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:26,800
This can become a very collective acceptance
also and once it becomes a collective acceptance,

35
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,319
it starts penetrating throughout.

36
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,759
It does not only have the effect of absorption,
but also it has an effect of affecting other

37
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,560
things.

38
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:48,490
Say a person whose eyes are what we call flirtish
or roving eyes, such a person, if he goes

39
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,289
to one group of people who do not know what
flirting is, do not know what roving eyes

40
00:06:54,289 --> 00:07:04,849
is, with very steady eyes, he can influence
those people and can make some of them of

41
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,800
the same kind.

42
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:19,169
So what happens, really, is this, that, this
is a very good door for all kinds of bhoots

43
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:29,879
to enter, entities to enter, and when you
start projecting it back, the same bhoots

44
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:41,599
can pass into another person and can create
the same kind of vacuum or same kind of vulnerability

45
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:50,809
in the Hamsa Chakra of other people.

46
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:58,819
So that’s why eyes have to be very, very
clean, innocent.

47
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:07,370
Another, you can see, is what you hear.

48
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,879
Some people, if they hear something nonsensical,
they’ll just put their hands to their ears.

49
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,729
They don’t want to hear anything.

50
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:25,259
But there are some people who like it and
go on enjoying it.

51
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:33,000
Ultimately, they become servile or, we can
say, conditioned, that they like all these

52
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,289
horrible things that normally a human being
won’t like.

53
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:50,470
Now, also you must have seen that people who,
like French people, I think they have no discretion

54
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,470
of smell.

55
00:08:51,470 --> 00:09:02,420
They smell so awful, but they eat all rotten
food, rotten cheese, rotten, absolutely rotten

56
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,600
wines, but they never smell it.

57
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,170
Anybody in their company can smell it.

58
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,620
Even their hands smell of their rotten cheese,
you can’t just [bare to] smell it.

59
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,230
But they have lost the power.

60
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:21,740
In the same way, in our country we have a
caste called sweepers who do all the cleaning

61
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,400
of dirty things with their hands.

62
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,690
They have no sense of smell.

63
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,800
They have lost the sense of smell.

64
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
The nose has lost that smell sense.

65
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,140
They cannot smell anything dirty.

66
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,709
That’s how they can do their work.

67
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:47,680
So if you start also not being alert to fragrance
– I’ve seen also there are certain things

68
00:09:47,680 --> 00:10:00,620
people use made of tobacco, they are supposed
to be very good, very famous brands of perfumes

69
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,009
like ‘Tabac’ and all that.

70
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:11,630
So once they start liking that kind of a thing,
then they have other things like ‘Poison‘

71
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,680
and other horrible things, which, it’s horrible
smell in it.

72
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,699
Apart from that, first [thing] you smell is
alcohol, is a spirit!

73
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:34,270
But they don’t mind because they see in
that a very congenial type of a pleasure.

74
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:40,120
But these pleasures, ultimately, can kill
all the cells of the nose and afterwards one

75
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,750
may even lose the sense of smell.

76
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,830
One of the joy-giving organ is the sense of
smell.

77
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:54,370
When the Kundalini rises in many people they
get a fragrance of many things.

78
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:01,850
Some people get of guggul or sometimes they
get a fragrance of sandalwood or something,

79
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:09,759
which is a very natural essence of flowers
or maybe of some woods.

80
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:23,060
But these unnaturally made things which are
actually destructive to your cells of smelling,

81
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:29,120
that is what they start using, and once you
start using these kind of things then what

82
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,199
happens is that you don’t feel any bad smell
anywhere, like animals.

83
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,940
But so many animals can smell, if not they
don’t call it bad or good, but they can

84
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,960
smell.

85
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,350
Even that sensitivity of good and bad smell
which we human beings have got is lost.

86
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:56,149
So whatever is our ascent, as human beings,
at what a level we have gone, start completely

87
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,960
disappearing, gradually, one by one.

88
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,810
Then same with the throat.

89
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:23,509
If the throat is using bad languages and is
being used for abusing people, showing temper

90
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:36,250
on people or anything of aggression or sometimes
people take things which can also spoil the

91
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:49,339
throat by their destructive qualities, like
alcohol; specially the smoking.

92
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:56,389
If you smoke then the throat gets vulnerable
and the sweetness of your voice is lost.

93
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:00,600
Then they speak with a hoarse voice.

94
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,279
But this is all external.

95
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
It starts becoming external.

96
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:17,860
Mouth smells with that and also the teeth
react to all such things, which we take without

97
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,861
discretion about it, because that’s the
fashion, because it is marketing well, because

98
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:26,190
it is advertised!

99
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:32,480
That means we have not got our own wisdom,
our own personality.

100
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:40,389
But when this centre is awakened, then what
you develop is a discretion.

101
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:50,630
As I was telling them yesterday how the word
Hamsa has come for this centre.

102
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:58,630
Because there’s a Sanskrit, very beautiful,
couplet, which says that a swan is white and

103
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,800
a crane is a white bird.

104
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,760
What is the difference between the swan and
a crane?

105
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:16,560
The answer is that when you mix milk with
water, the swan will just suck in the milk

106
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:26,480
while the crane has no discretion, no vivek.

107
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:37,420
This discretionary power, once we start losing,
we start becoming just like robots, I would

108
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,029
say, because we have no personality.

109
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:48,209
Anybody can brainwash us and the more they
tell us about our discretion we listen to

110
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,209
them.

111
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:55,360
That explains why people, so many thousands
of people, go to all these false gurus.

112
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,430
Thousands of people, why did they take to
homosexuality and got into AIDS?

113
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:10,510
Why thousands of people have taken to drugs?

114
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,129
It is unbelievable!

115
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,370
Incredible!

116
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,980
Why people have taken to all these things
[and] are destroying their life.

117
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,649
They see a man going into the pub, coming
out and falling down on the ground with all

118
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,170
his purse being emptied.

119
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,939
But they go with the purse, see that they
have sufficient money to go inside the pub,

120
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:36,060
again come out to fall down on the street.

121
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:46,550
Whatever idiotic or nonsensical [things] other
people are doing, when you see they’re idiotic,

122
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,670
you pay money to become idiotic.

123
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:57,860
One pays money to destroy oneself, go out
of the way.

124
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,620
It is so unnatural for anyone.

125
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,630
I mean even a dog or a cat, or any animal,
knows where is the danger is.

126
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:14,569
They can smell the danger and they run away
because they have to preserve their lives.

127
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:21,389
They think their lives are precious and they
must live and live well.

128
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:29,460
But this ordinary, common sense starts missing
and they will say, “What’s wrong?

129
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,550
What’s wrong in this?

130
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,170
What’s wrong in that?”

131
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,730
That means the genetics of the Hamsa are missing.

132
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:51,680
Now you should see there is no Deity on the
Hamsa Chakra, but it is the formless energy

133
00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:12,290
of so many organs which are looked after by
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ, Shri Krishna – four

134
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,060
of them, managed by Shri Ganesha.

135
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:24,930
So these genetics are put by Shri Ganesha
because He is the source of the Wisdom.

136
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:35,760
So first, once they spoil their Mooladhara,
the wisdom is finished: [the] basis, the fundamentals,

137
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,240
are finished.

138
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:50,740
That’s why immoral life is very detrimental
to our life because we lose our discretion,

139
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,610
the discretion is lost.

140
00:17:53,610 --> 00:18:08,140
Then if you can awaken Shri Ganesha in the
Hamsa Chakra, then suddenly you belong to

141
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,850
the higher race of Sahaja Yogis.

142
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,880
It’s surprising.

143
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:21,590
I’ve seen people overnight give up their
drugs, very immoral people become extremely

144
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:31,909
moral because of this chakra being suddenly
awakened and the light of the Spirit is best

145
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:44,520
expressed through this chakra in everyday
life, in the collective life also.

146
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,190
One starts then seeing the point, as we say.

147
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,070
Like now, in Sahaja Yogas, we have different
problems, also.

148
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:03,409
Say, when people first come to Sahaja Yoga,
they start watching other people and starting

149
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,710
finding their faults, what’s wrong with
them.

150
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,799
They never see what they are here for.

151
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,230
They are not here to find out faults with
others, but to correct your own defects.

152
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,049
So they say, “Oh, this man is no good.

153
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:20,100
That man is no good.

154
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,190
This is wrong.”

155
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,400
They start creating problems, you see.

156
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,039
They’ll talk to each other, saying, “Oh
this man is not good.

157
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,940
That man is not good,” try create groups
and things.

158
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,700
They’re here to offer what?

159
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:44,330
Or create a politics or for your ascent?

160
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,600
Some of them, if they do not do all this,
then they think we should start to make some

161
00:19:49,600 --> 00:20:03,950
money out of it or some sort of a thing, or
some start criticising others about something,

162
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:10,409
which is not their concern.

163
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:15,240
So they forget because they are just now coming
to Sahaja Yoga and their genetics are not

164
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,679
established of their wisdom.

165
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:26,640
They start worrying about things, which are
not their worry, which they should not bother

166
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,950
about.

167
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,330
Then some of them start thinking, “Oh, I
am the leader!”

168
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,370
or “Why am I not the leader?”

169
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,600
So they start finding fault with the leadership.

170
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,040
Sometimes leader also can feel, “Oh, I am
the leader.

171
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:54,470
I can be very stern, very disciplinary and
I can control people.

172
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,450
I can do this.”

173
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:09,159
They have come here to learn how to love,
to be compassionate, to be tolerant.

174
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:24,760
The sense of leadership and also of obedience
– both are discretionary.

175
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:33,450
If somebody says something to you and if you
obey that person for your benevolence, you

176
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:40,289
will subtly understand that it is for your
good.

177
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:46,440
If some leader says that “This is wrong
with you,” try to see if it is wrong, instead

178
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,620
of feeling hurt about it.

179
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,320
“Yes, it is wrong with me.

180
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,390
So what should I do?

181
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,600
How can I improve myself?”

182
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,510
Ask the leader or you can write to Me or do
anything.

183
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,510
But no!

184
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,510
They will not do it.

185
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,149
Immediately they will write a letter to Me
saying, “This leader is such-and-such, bad

186
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:03,149
fellow.

187
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:04,149
He’s so this thing.

188
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:05,169
He ate that money.

189
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:06,250
He ate that thing!”

190
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,350
and all kinds of things.

191
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,450
Or else they may tell people, “Oh, Mother
listens to this fellow.

192
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,450
He’s no good.

193
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,580
He’s just telling Mother stories and Mother
listens!”

194
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,970
Mother is not such a fool.

195
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,450
She knows about everything.

196
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:33,440
So all these things that we have gathered
from our previous life, even after our second

197
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,049
birth we carry little bit.

198
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:42,559
Like an egg becomes a bird but still lots
of things of the egg are hanging on to his

199
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,500
body, so you have to cleanse it.

200
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,080
So, at this point, when you have got your
realisation, the first discretion should be,

201
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,700
“How am I going to achieve that state of
Spirit?”

202
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,279
The Pure Spirit!

203
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:05,860
Instead of that, also, people get lost because
they have no discretion.

204
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:15,820
With this enlightenment, first thing that
happens, I’ve seen with people: Their eyes

205
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,910
are fixed.

206
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,090
They don’t rove their eyes much now.

207
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:26,789
They have very innocent eyes.

208
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:33,960
Otherwise they are really mad, those people
who go on looking at everything like this.

209
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,460
There’s no difference between madman and
him.

210
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:42,360
You put one madman, he does the same and a
person who is like that does the same.

211
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:51,860
And it’s such a crazy thing to do, but immediately…I
mean, it is such a spontaneous thing.

212
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,980
It’s like the light coming in the room.

213
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,919
It is so spontaneous that you start seeing
things clearly – “No, no.

214
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,500
This is not good!”

215
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Before in the garden, you would go and collect
all the thorns and put them in your body.

216
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,840
That was the situation.

217
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,440
Never looked at the flowers.

218
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,870
And suddenly, after realisation, you will
be amazed, you just see flowers and don’t

219
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:30,890
bother about thorns, or if you find you take
them out.

220
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:41,230
There is joy even before realisation and after
realisation, but there is no capacity to enjoy.

221
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:50,799
That capacity comes to you after realisation
and the main thing that happens to you is

222
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,580
the discretion.

223
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,710
Then, like the swan, you just take the milk
of everything.

224
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:10,220
At everything your attitude becomes very different,
you start seeing things in a different angle.

225
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:19,030
Like once we had to go to one very ancient
temple to see some art.

226
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:26,370
Me, my son-in-law and my daughter, we were
walking up up, we had to walk for miles, up

227
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:32,159
the hill and they were very tired so we went
into one temple and just laid down ourselves.

228
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,519
They were so tired.

229
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:40,180
At that time I said, “See these elephants,
see how beautiful they are, every one has

230
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:52,159
a different type of a tail and a different
type of a trunk, the poses are different.

231
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,260
So many of them are like that.”

232
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,620
My son-in-law said, “Babaa!

233
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,110
We are so tired.

234
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,919
How are you looking at these things?”

235
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:07,240
Because attention didn’t go to my tiredness
but to those beautiful things.

236
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,360
Same thing, you start sucking in the milk.

237
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:20,190
There is joy but you cannot feel the joy because
the power, that subtle power of Divine Discretion

238
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,530
is not there.

239
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,140
Once that comes in, you start enjoying everything.

240
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:36,200
It’s just the same, [your] life is just
the same, nothing has changed: same house,

241
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,460
same family, same city, same environment.

242
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:52,960
But you start enjoying because the sensitivity
of your Hamsa Chakra is now only for Divine

243
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:01,440
Discretion and you immediately know and then
you don’t want to do anything with the thorns,

244
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,340
only want to gather flowers and you know how
to gather flowers and you are in joy.

245
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:19,590
So the light of the Spirit, which shines through
your Hamsa Chakra, gives you wisdom.

246
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:25,250
Wisdom doesn’t mean that you know how to
argue things or you fight with people.

247
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,930
No, it doesn’t mean that!

248
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:40,910
Wisdom means how you take to the good side
of everything, to enjoy it, this is Wisdom.

249
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:48,820
And that you avoid all destructive things
and take to something constructive.

250
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:56,660
Now you are going, say, on a road and is written
there – there’s danger.

251
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,840
Before realisation they will say, “All right.

252
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,920
Let’s see what is danger.”

253
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,730
They’ll jump into it and say that, “We
have got nirvana” by killing themselves.

254
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,730
Such explanations!

255
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,220
But a sensible man will say, “All right,
danger?

256
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Go back.

257
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,230
What’s the harm, after all?”

258
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,520
He preserves himself.

259
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:27,590
He respects his life because he knows now
[that] he has become the instrument of God.

260
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:35,610
So Wisdom comes to you automatically, but
through experience.

261
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,730
Then you know this is the right path.

262
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,480
Through experience you start understanding.

263
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,669
Nowadays I am telling all these things to
you.

264
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:50,290
Say, if, twenty years back, I never talked
of these things to them, [it was] because

265
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,059
I knew if I start talking, they’ll say,
“Oh, She’s talking something out of the

266
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,059
blue.

267
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,240
God knows if it is true or not.”

268
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:07,010
But once the wisdom becomes transparent and
you start seeing through it, everything, very

269
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:15,600
clearly, makes your mind absolutely clear
then, anybody who then tells things of wisdom,

270
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,850
you never feel bad about it, on the contrary,
you thank that “I’m so lucky that I can

271
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,289
hear about these things, such a nice things!”

272
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:29,769
And also those sayings start giving you joy.

273
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:35,450
So, with the ear you hear so many things.

274
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,960
Used to hear the same things, might [be] hearing
so much music, everything – before also

275
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,140
– but never gave you joy.

276
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:51,730
Now, because of this transformation, the same
music, which you heard before, now makes you

277
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,899
feel as if you are in the seventh heaven.

278
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:57,940
It gives you ecstasy.

279
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:04,880
The poetry, which was quite mundane, ordinary,
people told Me, “Mother, it was such a headache

280
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,179
to read William Blake in those days.

281
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:08,620
But now we love it.

282
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,389
We read it like Bible!”

283
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:17,950
Because now you have developed new sight,
new hearing power.

284
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:24,539
All these are called in Sanskrit ‘atindrya’,
means ‘the organs which are subtle organs

285
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,570
within us’.

286
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:36,909
So eyes have a subtle organ, ears have a subtle
organ and these subtle organs then start emitting

287
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:46,500
such responses to all the surroundings that
you just gather whatever is beautiful.

288
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,970
Say it is very dark.

289
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,470
Normally, you’ll be frightened.

290
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:01,010
But if it is very dark, you say, “Oh, it’s
very good.

291
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,520
How we are enjoying here na?

292
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,340
It’s such venturesome thing!”

293
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,789
You’ll go slowly, slowly holding each other’s
hands.

294
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:14,730
Supposing it is very hot: Then maybe somebody
would say, people may start, I don’t know

295
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,289
what they would do!

296
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:21,721
Another would just say, “It’s quite nice
day, you see, it’s nice sometimes to also

297
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:22,721
have hot.

298
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:23,721
It’s also very good!”

299
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:24,721
– like that.

300
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:25,769
If it is cold, the other way round.

301
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:32,330
So, thus you start enjoying every aspect which
is supposed to be very, very bad for others,

302
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:38,679
[but] to you, you know the aspect of that,
what is to be enjoyed, that part which is

303
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:48,090
to be enjoyed, and once you know how to do
it, then you say, “We are swimming in the

304
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,870
Ocean of Joy.”

305
00:31:49,870 --> 00:32:02,710
The Ocean is the same, but now you just achieve
those beautiful drops of ambrosia which are

306
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:10,080
in that Ocean and the rest are worried of
getting drowned.

307
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,549
Same Ocean!

308
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:12,549
Same world!

309
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:16,399
That’s why they say it’s a maya.

310
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:23,759
But after this discretion is shining there’s
no maya – you start enjoying.

311
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:31,909
It’s like this, supposing you drop somebody
in the ocean, he’ll be so frightened and

312
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,210
he’ll die before even he’s sunk really!

313
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:41,289
But supposing a person there is, with all
his things to watch and he is the one who

314
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:47,029
is going to see all the beauty of the underworld.

315
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,799
He’s very nicely secured.

316
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:55,490
He’s got big, beautiful glasses and all
that and he’s wearing nice paddles.

317
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,179
He doesn’t have to bother.

318
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,480
He just goes there, nicely enjoys everything,
takes photographs.

319
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,720
The ocean is the same for him or for the one
who is dropped in the ocean.

320
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,750
But the one who is secured, the one who has
all the equipments, the one who knows what

321
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,759
is to be seen is enjoying it.

322
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:29,480
In the same way, you are equipped with wisdom,
with security and you know what you are doing,

323
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,450
and the same thing starts becoming so very
beautiful and enjoyable.

324
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:39,080
I have seen how Sahaja Yogis enjoy everything.

325
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:47,519
Even if somebody is shouting or saying something
in a hall, I’ve seen all the Sahaja Yogis

326
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,830
start laughing, laughing, laughing, you know.

327
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:55,659
He’s, poor man, trying his level best to
condemn everything, and here all the Sahaja

328
00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:00,220
Yogis – just laughing at him, doing nothing,
and that fellow runs away.

329
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:07,299
It is something so…I mean they’re enjoying
his stupidity.

330
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:17,120
So the whole attitude of life is so changed
because of this Hamsa Chakra and you are not

331
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,570
even aware that you have developed that Wisdom…automatically!

332
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:33,110
Then you start also consolidating it and making
it your own enlightened faith because every

333
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:42,550
time you see [that] whatever you believe in
just works out.

334
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:55,501
You see, suddenly you find that things are
brought to you without your knowledge, without

335
00:34:55,501 --> 00:35:00,860
any effort, which you have been trying to
get.

336
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,960
People suddenly meet you and you are helped.

337
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,810
So many things happen.

338
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:13,230
Recently, somebody came from India and he
had said that, “I would like to meet somebody

339
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,960
at Milan station“.

340
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,790
So we sent somebody, but he was wearing a
very small, little badge so this gentleman

341
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:29,369
couldn’t see, and he was watching for somebody
there.

342
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:38,060
Suddenly, he saw one gentleman standing, like
a Sahaja Yogi, very relaxed, watching everybody,

343
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,870
not running, not upset.

344
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,109
He went and asked him, “Did you come for
me?”

345
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,510
“Yes, yes, yes.

346
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,510
I was wondering.

347
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,410
I thought it is you only who has come.”

348
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:55,920
So, you make them out because their styles
are different, their standing methods are

349
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,180
different, their talking is different, the
way they behave.

350
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:10,350
It’s all, you see, is a miracle the way
the whole life and personality is changed.

351
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:20,490
Once my husband had taken a Sahaja Yogi to
a library, a British library and people are

352
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,660
very rude there.

353
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,960
So they were late by about one or two minutes
and it was closing time.

354
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,530
The fellow just started shouting at him.

355
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,020
So the Sahaja Yogi said, “Yes, I agree.

356
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,670
You see, we are late, but these traffics don’t
understand any laws that this library closes

357
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,430
at this time, you know.

358
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,480
They don’t understand – the traffic, you
see.

359
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,869
They wouldn’t listen to us.

360
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:47,000
We told them the library’s closing, you
see,” Fellow started looking at them!

361
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,641
“But they wouldn’t understand it.

362
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:49,641
So important.

363
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:56,440
You know, the traffic was stopping us and
we are sorry we are here so late, but next

364
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,730
time we’ll not do like that.”

365
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:06,070
The fellow got absolutely so flabbergasted
and the whole thing melted away.

366
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,700
He said, “All right, come along.”

367
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,940
He opened the library for one hour after that.

368
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:24,240
So the wisdom of handling people, wisdom of
talking to them, wisdom of handling your jobs,

369
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,900
everything starts working out.

370
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,440
And if it doesn’t work, you don’t feel
bad.

371
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
You think, “What to do?

372
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,740
The other fellow is not a Sahaja Yogi”.

373
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,420
You tried it’s…what can be done?

374
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:47,770
Like this time, when we were coming, there
was a nice gentleman who is something like

375
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,220
a manager in the KLM and all that.

376
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,109
So he came and told Me, “There’s a little
difficulty that there’s no seat for others.

377
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,730
Only three persons first class can go.

378
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,150
It’s impossible.

379
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,750
He’s a friend of mine.

380
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,620
He just can’t help you.”

381
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,120
I said, “All right.”

382
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,910
I went and sat on the chair.

383
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,770
I did like this (bandhan) only I think, three
times must have.

384
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,089
“Oh, there are six seats already there!

385
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:18,880
From where did they come up?”

386
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,440
So then you start seeing one point very clearly
ki (that) there is this All-Pervading Power

387
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,550
which is very active, which is watching us.

388
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:33,589
All the great saints are managing things.

389
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:41,450
Or sometimes you feel as if the angels are
with you, how they’re guiding things, how

390
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,930
they’re helping us, how they’re there,
how it is working out.

391
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:52,270
Then you start seeing all that, then you start
knowing it and believing in it, then this

392
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,720
discretion settles down.

393
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,430
Till that state it is settled down, it’s
quite possible that Sahaja Yogis might slip

394
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,420
out of Sahaja Yoga.

395
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,829
I have known many that, they come to Sahaja
Yoga and just slip out on small, small points

396
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:11,780
like that.

397
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:17,839
Some other Sahaja Yogi, of their style only,
can say something harsh to them and they slip

398
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,839
out.

399
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:23,990
Because on the periphery we have all kinds
of people and on the periphery if you stop

400
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:29,359
and somebody says something to you, then they
drop out because they have not reached that

401
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:35,599
state of discretion that, “This is the right
place I’m in.

402
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,850
If another is wrong, he’ll get out.

403
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,870
Why should I get out?”

404
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:49,470
The growth is only possible when your Hamsa
is put right.

405
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:55,840
Without that till you are completely there,
it’s very difficult.

406
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:06,510
But once the Hamsa is established, I have
seen people become really very dedicated.

407
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,980
As you know, it is very big organisation we
have, all over the world.

408
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:16,870
I have no secretary, I have no organisation,
I have nothing like an office also.

409
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:23,710
But everything, everybody’s my secretary,
everybody’s working it out on their own.

410
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,680
They’re identified with it.

411
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,210
They are responsible for it.

412
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,619
I don’t have…I’m like a plug, they put
Me here, alright, there, there.

413
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,330
It’s all right wherever they put!

414
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:40,079
Only this much of discretion, that they’re
my children, they’ll not do anything to

415
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,110
harm Me, they’ll look after Me.

416
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:52,250
Sometimes, of course, it could be quite hectic,
could be very fast movement, whatever it is,

417
00:40:52,250 --> 00:41:00,290
but I don’t mind because they are doing
so much for Sahaja Yoga and they want to do

418
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:06,400
it more and more and they are so responsible.

419
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,839
So I respect it.

420
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:14,349
Sometimes people say, “Mother, what a horrible
schedule You have.

421
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,930
We can’t bear to see it, you see, it is
too much.

422
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,930
How will You do this?”

423
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,430
I can do it!!

424
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:28,869
Because I have absolute faith in their identification
with Sahaja Yoga.

425
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:30,290
They are not cheats.

426
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,520
They are not hypocrites.

427
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,100
They’re not doing for their own being, own
self, but they’re doing it to help Sahaja

428
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:44,340
Yoga, to help others.

429
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:50,660
So the identification that you develop with
other wrong things just drops out, then you

430
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,940
start identifying yourself with beautiful
things because you start getting the fragrance

431
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,750
of the beauty.

432
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:05,780
Then you start enjoying that beauty and your
heart starts opening out.

433
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:17,430
All this joy and all these things are not
possible if your Hamsa is still infected with

434
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,030
ego or with conditionings.

435
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:26,510
We have so many conditionings like Hindus,
like Christians, like this, like that.

436
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,900
These conditionings are so much.

437
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:37,300
Such false things we are following.

438
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:45,210
But once we give up all these conditionings
in the faith that we are doing it for our

439
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:51,460
benevolence, this Agnya, this chakra opens
out very well.

440
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,920
Without this, Agnya cannot open.

441
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:02,740
I mean, you see, it’s an entry to Agnya,
it’s the entry to Vishuddhi, it’s the

442
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:08,230
entry to all the chakras of your head, the
peethas that are there.

443
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:15,630
So it’s so important to keep your Hamsa
Chakra clean!

444
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:23,900
I’ve also told lots of things that can keep
the Hamsa Chakra clean, which you all should

445
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,260
use, I mean on the physical level.

446
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,720
Also on the mental level I’ve told you what
you have to do: is to steady your mind, see

447
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:44,849
the beauty of anything and not the vulgarity
of it, not the utility of it, but the beauty.

448
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:57,359
Slowly, slowly you’ll find your eyes will
become cleaner and cleaner.

449
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:07,190
People are now so much in Sahaja Yoga because
of their depth maybe, because of their seeking

450
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:15,500
maybe, because of their janmas (births) maybe
or whatever it is.

451
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:24,170
But this Hamsa Chakra does the greatest thing
about which, I do not know if you are aware

452
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:30,829
or not, that, whatever are your karma phalas
(fruits of your actions) are finished.

453
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:37,920
You are not responsible for your forefathers
karma phalas, your country’s karma phalas

454
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,490
your own personal karma phalas.

455
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:53,619
Whatever wrong you have done is finished,
as if you are cut off from your past completely.

456
00:44:53,619 --> 00:45:06,280
Once this is established, then all mistakes,
all wrong-doings, not only of you, of your

457
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:12,980
relations, of your forefathers, of your family,
of your country, of this world, anything,

458
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,980
doesn’t touch you.

459
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,790
You are aloof from it.

460
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:30,099
And in this Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya
is 

461
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:39,930
trying to expose and to punish people for
their past karmas – collectively also, country-wise

462
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:52,059
also – will not be able to even touch you
because the light of this centre is extremely

463
00:45:52,059 --> 00:46:02,880
powerful and you will be redeemed of all the
fears of whatever you have done before.

464
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:13,589
You’ll just be beautiful like lotuses, which
are come out of the mire, and you’ll emit

465
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:16,250
beautiful fragrance all around the world.

466
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,829
May God bless you all.
