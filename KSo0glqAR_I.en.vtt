00:00:01.347 --> 00:00:08.275
Those issues which are not at all there
in animals are there in human beings.

00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:11.052
For an animal there
is no question of any issue,

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:13.376
He just exists.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.300
the power which is behind his existence

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:21.824
He has no issue with that.

00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:25.848
that, ‘which is the power behind
my existence’, he is not even concerned

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:29.847
The reason for that is

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:32.772
This Chaitanya Shakti.

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:37.796
Because this
creates the whole universe and sustains it,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.620
And organizes it.

00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:46.444
It flows through living
creatures and passes through them.

00:00:47.468 --> 00:00:54.868
Because
of a particular reason in a human being

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:04.692
and because
concerning of his particular way of life,

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:14.316
Some such creations are resulted, that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.140
Human gets disconnected with that power.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:22.864
If  we understand this

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:26.056
In simple words it can be said that

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:28.680
the ego which human beings have,

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:31.680
That’s not there in animals.

00:01:32.904 --> 00:01:38.904
his is mental defeat of human being

00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:41.428
That’s a lot different.

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:44.252
His brain is of triangular shape.

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:46.276
And in this Triangle

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.000
When this power

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:55.924
At the time a foetus is of 3
months in his mother’s womb

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:59.748
this power enters through inside and then

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:04.972
A refraction, as is
called in English ‘merger’

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:06.896
Called decentralization.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
it is divided into three parts.

00:02:10.644 --> 00:02:15.444
One part goes down directly through
the middle of back side of forehead.

00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:24.668
and remaining two
parts go down through the two angles

00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:26.892
Passing through bottom

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:30.016
And takes turn to go to back side.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.840
It is because
of these three type of powers only a man

00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:40.764
Looks elevated compared to an animal.

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:46.888
This power which
passes in the brain through triangle

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:49.512
and it passes through
one angle of triangle,

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.712
then it also develops another angle.

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:53.336
And because of that particular angle

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.460
its powers changes in two forms.

00:02:55.684 --> 00:02:59.084
If you people
are from physics then you will understand

00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:01.308
that power always
passes in a straight line.

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:04.932
But when it comes to this side passing
through like this then it seems like that,

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:07.356
it is changing form

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.180
divides it in two
powers which are called as components.

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:13.304
One goes outside like this and other goes
down like that.

00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:17.828
It is only because of
the force that goes outside; man gets

00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:20.352
a feeling of looking outside.

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:22.776
there is an animal,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.800
if he comes and sits on a stool

00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:27.924
then he will think of sitting on a stool.

00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:29.848
But if a man sits on a stool

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:32.072
then he will think how
I would own this stool,

00:03:32.396 --> 00:03:35.896
where did it come from, who made this?

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.220
Who has made it?

00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:42.744
Whatever he sees, he gets involved into it.

00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:47.168
If he sees any
human being then he gets involved in him.

00:03:47.592 --> 00:03:50.292
This is not a case in
an animal. He just lives.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:53.016
If his master comes then he becomes happy.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.140
If any stranger comes
then he starts barking.

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:57.464
If any thief
comes then he starts barking at him.

00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:01.488
He does not think of having it

00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:03.412
this mike I should take.

00:04:03.636 --> 00:04:05.136
I would get this table.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.060
It is called possession.

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:09.584
He does not get that thought.

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:11.608
He does not even
have appreciation of beauty.

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:16.432
He does not
think if something is beautiful or ugly.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.256
Its color is good or bad.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.980
He is just not bothered.

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:21.504
But man

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:25.828
gets involved in any particular thing.

00:04:26.352 --> 00:04:28.052
He goes further

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:30.776
and starts thinking

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.300
that “I am something,

00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:34.724
I have my identity

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:36.248
I have my power;

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:38.672
and I am something special”.

00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:41.296
Like, as we are born, we start thinking

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.420
that, I am Nirmala;

00:04:42.444 --> 00:04:43.844
I am Hindustani

00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:48.668
We are Hindu, Muslim, Christian.

00:04:50.192 --> 00:04:53.792
That is how we get entangled with whatever
type of outside identification we have.

00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:58.016
This type of tendency of going outside

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.040
Attributed to Man’s triangular Brain.

00:05:01.164 --> 00:05:03.664
It’s the result of this shape of brain.

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:07.888
If man does not go outside
then, there would be no further problem.

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:11.812
Like, cats and dogs have no such question.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.924
The entire
consciousness passes through them and

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:15.936
goes downwards. There is no question
before them.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.660
There is no reaction in their souls.

00:05:19.684 --> 00:05:20.884
But we do have.

00:05:21.108 --> 00:05:24.708
Whenever we look
at anything we have our reaction to it.

00:05:26.132 --> 00:05:27.432
Therefore within us

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:32.256
One power, originating from front
and the other coming from back

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.480
With in

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:38.004
Ego and super ego are just its reaction.

00:05:38.128 --> 00:05:42.928
ego and super ego
are formed and gathered here.

00:05:44.152 --> 00:05:46.052
Due to assembling of these,

00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:49.876
we are separated from
everywhere/ completely.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.648
On all around our sides

00:05:53.972 --> 00:05:55.472
The Power that resides,

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:57.396
We are bound with that power.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.920
We got separated. You got separated
You got separated, you got separated.

00:06:45.346 --> 00:06:48.388
you can see many things,

00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:54.097
If you dont get microscope,

00:07:16.555 --> 00:07:19.264
and if anybody bows down before me then,

00:07:24.513 --> 00:07:28.139
but you can see her
getting up and down here

00:07:36.306 --> 00:07:38.722
You can see throbbing for a long time.

00:08:00.097 --> 00:08:03.181
What problems he has in his body,

00:08:28.388 --> 00:08:34.056
The rising path of Kundalini is fixed,

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.972
There is a big space in between;

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:46.638
There is nothing between Vagus nerve

00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:13.930
When this Kundalini shakti rises,

00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:21.306
And again it goes up through this path

00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:34.764
First, it was filled within us

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.097
Now to fill new petrol again,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.555
From above, the Shakti (power) flows

00:10:04.388 --> 00:10:07.680
the gross
power and Chaitanya (vibratory) power

00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:16.638
there is a
light that is why it is being nourished.

00:10:17.056 --> 00:10:21.306
You are watching only the growth of tree

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:25.555
It is the Chaitanya
shakti (vibratory power) which

00:10:34.346 --> 00:10:39.097
when flow is opened
from above and it start coming from inside.

00:10:43.097 --> 00:10:49.097
But you, yourself reach that state

00:11:05.056 --> 00:11:09.513
And has come today
may be to get Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:18.472
Those persons who are Realized

00:11:18.472 --> 00:11:21.555
because they know

00:11:30.388 --> 00:11:33.181
but there was nobody to tell

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:36.472
Very few people have written

00:11:36.513 --> 00:11:41.472
And the biggest wonder is that

00:11:41.513 --> 00:11:45.139
But those who claim themselves to be

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:49.597
Adi Shankaracharya has talked

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:59.764
God is not
achieved either by sankhya or yoga,

00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:09.430
He had said that there were

00:12:15.097 --> 00:12:17.347
Those who have not yet developed

00:12:17.388 --> 00:12:21.139
For example, this mike is not yet

00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:25.472
there is no need to connect it to the mains

00:12:25.722 --> 00:12:29.680
Such types of people remain submerged

00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.056
Second type of people are those

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.889
they are stuck, by reason of which

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:48.805
These types
of people should get into yoga so that

00:12:59.014 --> 00:13:03.139
Now the only
difference between him and me is that

00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.139
and I say,  thousands in millions.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.014
May be possible that there used

00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:16.472
I see there are thousands of them

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:22.264
You must have read a lot about

00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:25.346
If you have read those books

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:29.056
Because there are such things said

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:37.056
 Some people say that person

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.722
But actually these people what

00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:48.181
This is not awakening of Kundalini,

00:13:48.472 --> 00:13:52.222
Since Kundalini is only awakened

00:14:01.306 --> 00:14:05.972
who, totally
in the form of vibrations of the God,

00:14:06.014 --> 00:14:09.472
Only that person can only fill the space,

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:19.555
Only those people can be called Realized,

00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:23.472
When these people give Realisation to you

00:14:24.638 --> 00:14:28.513
Then you will never see

00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:37.139
Now thousands of people have got

00:14:40.014 --> 00:14:43.347
and three to four thousand

00:14:45.388 --> 00:14:48.889
But we have never seen any man

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:53.430
Yes, of course, somewhat resistance,

00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:57.555
because as from here we are loving you,

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:02.930
may give you some trouble

00:15:03.078 --> 00:15:05.103
but that also get destroyed soon

00:15:05.227 --> 00:15:06.927
and that too runs away.

00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:10.264
Because when it sees that

00:15:11.555 --> 00:15:14.847
the darkness run away
after seeing the light.

00:15:15.805 --> 00:15:19.472
But so far now we have not seen

00:15:19.472 --> 00:15:22.306
Or got pimples, or having gone mad

00:15:22.597 --> 00:15:25.889
Just a few
days back we went somewhere. There

00:15:25.972 --> 00:15:29.014
He was asked not to sit like this.

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:34.972
Then I asked, Why? He said my Guru

00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:41.805
Then we told him that
you are not yet awakened.

00:15:55.306 --> 00:15:59.388
Because of exhaustion of these nadis

00:15:59.847 --> 00:16:03.597
And whatever work you do

00:16:07.264 --> 00:16:11.680
if you put on a heater

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.972
See what will be the conditiond.

00:16:13.196 --> 00:16:16.796
First let that be filled
with water of love.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.658
Unless and until there is

00:16:18.682 --> 00:16:20.620
addition
Of water of love in it.

00:16:20.644 --> 00:16:25.144
Until then that work won’t be done.

00:16:29.014 --> 00:16:33.805
That very
moment our this system, this sympathetic

00:16:37.638 --> 00:16:40.930
With the increase of your acting power,

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.513
And if your Pingala nadi runs excessively

00:16:52.555 --> 00:16:55.264
All the things will enter in to you,

00:17:05.097 --> 00:17:08.430
that then you just do not act. As if now

00:17:08.638 --> 00:17:11.680
except for it is enabling my voice

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.513
In the same way you become a hollow thing.

00:17:20.347 --> 00:17:23.513
gets established by

00:17:27.555 --> 00:17:31.930
Mother is already sitting in you.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.597
Many people say that

00:17:45.306 --> 00:17:48.346
and those people who have

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.638
in these people Kundalini do not rise

00:18:00.638 --> 00:18:04.014
and this excessive heat

00:18:12.056 --> 00:18:15.347
Now there are many

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:21.597
You cannot do anything

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.306
cannot do any living work.

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:33.930
Cats and dogs do
not think t h a t w a y .

00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:36.854
We can only do what is a dead work.

00:18:36.978 --> 00:18:41.478
For example, when a tree falls,
you make pillar out of it and erect it.

00:18:41.502 --> 00:18:42.502
All are dead things.

00:18:42.526 --> 00:18:43.726
not a single thing is living.

00:18:43.746 --> 00:18:46.913
And electricity and light that you have,

00:18:46.913 --> 00:18:50.289
Or light and all these electricity etc.,

00:18:56.306 --> 00:18:59.472
means that you cannot make

00:19:07.306 --> 00:19:10.264
Compared to that what your power

00:19:13.014 --> 00:19:17.346
Very powerful and in front of that

00:19:17.346 --> 00:19:19.805
What can you do to pull

00:19:19.805 --> 00:19:23.346
except that to exhaust the magnetic

00:19:27.181 --> 00:19:30.722
and he does not. It is an illusion,

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:36.056
Both get created and

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.306
In reality, God has

00:19:51.764 --> 00:19:56.139
These are always seen to us

00:20:06.097 --> 00:20:09.097
He knows minute to minute thing,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.972
When you come to Kundalini

00:20:33.722 --> 00:20:36.264
How great thing he has said

00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:42.014
This you can see in your Kundalini

00:20:42.238 --> 00:20:44.638
that your Kundalini itself

00:20:44.662 --> 00:20:46.962
God knows, in how many issues you are lost.

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:50.786
You might
be in your previous life be a Muslim,

00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:54.797
at least it should be acceptable Hindus

00:20:55.638 --> 00:20:59.346
The thing that you might be hating

00:20:59.638 --> 00:21:02.638
Because that time you used to hate

00:21:02.764 --> 00:21:06.680
so may be that you have now got

00:21:06.847 --> 00:21:09.764
What you call hatred, think

00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:13.638
If in previous life

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:23.805
Then in this life, its not necessary

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:38.222
If this finger believes or not,

00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:48.264
the power that is running through it,

00:21:48.346 --> 00:21:51.805
Whatever it is telling, whatever it is

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:04.346
Once, Shri Radha got jealous

00:22:05.764 --> 00:22:10.222
asked Shri Krishna what is so special
about this flute

00:22:12.306 --> 00:22:16.930
She went to flute and asked, what is your

00:22:18.513 --> 00:22:23.930
the flute replied,
Oh, mad, you do not even know that

00:22:23.972 --> 00:22:27.346
I have become totally hollow.

00:22:34.764 --> 00:22:39.139
Then, Its said
that Shri Radha asked Shri Krishna

00:22:44.264 --> 00:22:46.264
But becoming hollow does not mean

00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:49.088
that you would
get rid of doing your job. Many people

00:22:51.513 --> 00:22:55.472
But people say that
this is our responsibility.

00:23:01.805 --> 00:23:04.889
But if any senseless person is there,

00:23:08.056 --> 00:23:10.513
that there are pillars to support the roof.

00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:17.222
till there is ignorance man

00:23:20.346 --> 00:23:24.388
And if I get into this trouble then

00:23:26.181 --> 00:23:29.347
In reality, you can do work with perfection

00:23:29.722 --> 00:23:34.264
Because your inner power is so

00:23:37.014 --> 00:23:41.346
That no sooner it starts
flowing through you,

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.056
People will be amazed to see

00:23:49.388 --> 00:23:52.430
Now here is Miss. Maniklal.

00:23:57.014 --> 00:23:59.889
that she herself says that I think,

00:23:59.889 --> 00:24:02.722
Those people who
could not even write a simple poem,

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.014
Absolutely simple, such that

00:24:12.056 --> 00:24:15.638
After that when she became realized,

00:24:20.388 --> 00:24:24.555
the moment when he become a witness,

00:24:30.972 --> 00:24:34.139
his thousand hands are there around you,

00:24:35.388 --> 00:24:38.930
You do not understand how the things are

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.181
Such wonderful things start happening

00:24:48.805 --> 00:24:51.597
that how this thing has worked out,

00:24:52.597 --> 00:24:55.346
But the vision of man must not be on that,

00:24:58.346 --> 00:25:00.680
kindly awaken our Kundalini

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:05.972
In reality you become completely powerless,

00:25:06.097 --> 00:25:08.972
The power of God gets flowed

00:25:09.097 --> 00:25:12.597
are surrendered to him

00:25:13.264 --> 00:25:19.430
The essence of whatever has been described

00:25:24.346 --> 00:25:28.056
which may be called as spontaneous growth

00:25:30.972 --> 00:25:34.346
He was wandering thousands of places here

00:25:34.388 --> 00:25:40.139
getting tired laying down his

00:25:40.181 --> 00:25:45.014
somehow instantly at that very moment,

00:25:45.264 --> 00:25:49.930
and from below the
Kundalini strike down his Sahasrara

00:25:50.014 --> 00:25:53.430
Nobody has ever got Realisation

00:25:59.805 --> 00:26:04.097
then we left that place in Delhi.

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:06.972
to shift to Delhi.Then after

00:26:06.972 --> 00:26:10.264
That we went here to there, then from there

00:26:10.264 --> 00:26:13.346
People said Sahib this is here itself

00:26:16.889 --> 00:26:20.264
That they first went there, then from there

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:28.347
The mess, that resulted in that travelling

00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:32.306
But the one who has got it

00:26:33.139 --> 00:26:35.972
The best example of this is

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.472
when his
Kundalini was awakened. While writing

00:26:40.472 --> 00:26:43.430
and when he was realized by that time his

00:26:43.513 --> 00:26:47.346
That time he took to Samadhi. Because

00:26:47.346 --> 00:26:51.472
Attained this. Now
that so much is written down,

00:26:56.722 --> 00:27:00.638
The entire quest might be lost;

00:27:07.472 --> 00:27:10.805
Kundilini is always with you

00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:23.680
Then his Kundalini says, ok

00:27:26.056 --> 00:27:28.222
Seeks solace in one power;

00:27:28.264 --> 00:27:31.222
Then he seeks power, then

00:27:33.097 --> 00:27:36.222
dharma is also outside us. Our

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:41.306
The entire thing is that of inside.

00:27:41.638 --> 00:27:43.597
That is why he seeks outside,

00:27:50.346 --> 00:27:53.722
But the essence of all

00:27:53.764 --> 00:27:57.430
Those who are realized, all such

00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:06.597
He says, why to go to forest

00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:10.805
Like fragrance in a flower

00:28:16.805 --> 00:28:20.222
It is just like if a doctor has

00:28:20.222 --> 00:28:23.972
for your headache and you are cramming,

00:28:30.097 --> 00:28:34.097
By seeking within means

00:28:41.889 --> 00:28:44.972
All those of who are sitting here you

00:28:45.097 --> 00:28:47.889
it is the seeking of thousands of years

00:28:48.097 --> 00:28:51.972
Because of that you get your own right.

00:28:52.014 --> 00:28:56.181
Like you go to a bank and you get

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.930
If we do not give you your Self-realisation

00:29:04.056 --> 00:29:06.306
Whatever you are getting,

00:29:22.097 --> 00:29:23.722
Your Kundalini knows you.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.056
that when in your freedom

00:29:32.097 --> 00:29:35.347
we want absolute that very day

00:29:57.805 --> 00:30:01.264
If you have any question
about your Kundalini,

00:30:14.847 --> 00:30:18.680
Once you are realized

00:30:35.056 --> 00:30:39.472
But just by their one
glance their Kundalini

00:31:01.472 --> 00:31:05.472
Their own attachment to God,

00:31:19.056 --> 00:31:21.847
he never sees that in his ego.

00:31:22.346 --> 00:31:25.139
because whenever he gives he says

00:31:29.889 --> 00:31:33.555
Even if it is your son, you cannot say

00:31:33.597 --> 00:31:36.346
When he gets it, then it is known

00:31:36.347 --> 00:31:39.972
Such vibrations start coming from inside.

00:31:45.306 --> 00:31:48.306
No politics can be considered,
no pressure can be considered.

00:31:48.346 --> 00:31:50.847
no relation can work,

00:31:52.472 --> 00:31:55.972
which can be called as myth

00:32:06.847 --> 00:32:10.388
But still you should keep

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.264
That in Human being ego is

00:32:14.306 --> 00:32:16.472
That the moment I say this

00:32:17.638 --> 00:32:20.555
If I say that stand upside down,

00:32:23.388 --> 00:32:26.056
But the thing, which is free to get

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.880
and which is achieved without any effort,

00:32:30.097 --> 00:32:32.346
Because he has a

00:32:32.388 --> 00:32:34.388
and he does not know

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.597
that if he moves his finger

00:32:37.638 --> 00:32:38.764
and if he wants

00:32:38.788 --> 00:32:44.488
that he can lit the lamp in
the small-small particles of this creation.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.346
unless and until there is experience

00:33:01.805 --> 00:33:03.222
Are you coming!
