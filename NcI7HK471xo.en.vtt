00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Evening program, Avignon, France, 07-07-1990

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:09.205
Give her a chair

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.400
Give her a chair

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.020
otherwise she won't be able to play harmonium.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.640
Ah,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.380
[Hindi]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.920
[Hindi]

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.520
Can you keep it up there? Ah. On that.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.560
[Hindi]

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.140
[Hindi]

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.480
[Hindi]

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.060
[Hindi]

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.580
You can move that.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.780
Come on. Have a sit there.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.560
We would like to present you a "Bharood" [Marathi religious song]

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.860
by Sant Eknath

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.060
It's a song that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.880
in a style that

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.680
is designed

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.680
to teach people

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.800
what will happen to them if they don't behave in a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.700
in the correct way

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.220
In this particular song

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580
Sant Eknath is talking about

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.340
what happens to people if they're not, if they trick people

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.220
badly

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:21.955
if they are rude to them, if they cheat them.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:26.515
Sant Eknath gives example in particular

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.540
of Duryodhana

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.965
who took Draupadi and humiliated her in his court.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.480
and it was eventually

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.765
his brother, the brother of Duryodhana

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:42.075
drag Draupadi into the court to be humiliated.

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:45.415
And was eventually punished by Bhishma

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:51.045
punished by Bhishma in a dual.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.380
In the same way, Ravana who kidnapped Shri Sita

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.780
was duly punished by Shri Rama.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900
And so on in many cases.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.700
In reality, there are only four

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.800
people, that Sant Eknath mentions

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.340
who are free from any kind of

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.060
problem in his regard.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.980
For example, Bhishma

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.380
and

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:24.285
Hanumana, those two are examples.

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:28.835
Sant Eknath concludes the song

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.585
inviting us to be

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:35.880
sweet with each other and not to abuse each other.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.760
Otherwise - cause if we do,

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:39.275
then our fate

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:42.285
is a very ugly one.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.600
Give me a microphone for tablas.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.720
When standing, they will wait.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.360
Yes.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.760
So, all of you can sit there like this only.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160
Patrick!

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.800
Yes.

00:13:23.515 --> 00:13:24.805
We have another

00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:27.525
song for you. This time it's a

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:29.455
village's song, a folk's song

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.200
from Uttar Pradesh.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.155
The context of the song is

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.080
a group of villagers on a way to a festival at Prayag

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.020
in the month of Magha which is January or February.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:51.060
And Prayag is a place where the two holy rivers of India, Ganga and Yamuna, meet.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.340
So, in the first verse, the villagers are singing the praises of Prayag

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.740
where the rivers meet,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.820
and for this reason, it's a holy place,

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.440
a place of pilgrimage.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.600
In the second verse, they explain how Ganga comes from Haridwar

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.060
which is also a place of pilgrimage because Ganga has come down from the heaven in that place.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.160
So it has come from Haridwar,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.460
which is a popular place of pilgrimage,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.520
to Prayag which is also a place of pilgrimage.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.880
Come here, on the same line. You go a little bit that side.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.780
Ok, very good.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.420
Ah! This reminded me of my own marriage when I went to my

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.840
husband's house.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.620
They all used to sing like this only there.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.300
So, it's wonderful, the way they have sung it, absolutely with  complete pronunciation,

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.720
everything, it's wonderful.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.460
I was just enjoying it. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have enjoyed too.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.560
The group of students who are sitting in front of you, on the stage,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.500
have been learning classical music

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.160
at Garlate house near Milano, I hope you - all of you know

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.220
Garlate house.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.100
And they covered about seven ragas.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.180
Among these ragas, they learnt Marva rag

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.000
which is the favorite raga of Shri Mataji.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:13.880
And they will sing what we call the chutta khayal [composition] in ektaal [12 beats].

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.920
First, they will sing the aroha [ascending scale]

00:23:18.265 --> 00:23:20.445
and pakad [melodic theme] of raga Marva

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.200
and then sargam [singing notes].

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.780
Aroha is ascend

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.200
Aroha is, are the ascending notes of the raga

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.920
And Avaroha are the descending notes of the raga.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.760
And pakad are the group of notes typical of that raga,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.660
so that the raga can be recognized when those notes are sung.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.440
And they are singing the chutta khayal in ektaal.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.720
And before singing the chutta khayal,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.720
they will sing sargam.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.340
Sargam, they will sing also in double rhythm.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.620
And chutta khayal, they will sing with alap and taans [first and second part of the raga].

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.700
I hope all of you will like it and Shri Mataji will also like what they sing in the present.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.240
Is a prayer composed by Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.220
in raga Bhairavi.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.240
"Antara Mama Bikoshito Karo, antara tara hey"

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:27.860
The devotee is praying to the God that: "Let my inner being be enlightened."

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.920
"Nirmala karo, ujjwala karo, sundara karo hey."

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.000
Nirmala, you know: Shri Mataji's name is Nirmala, pure.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.380
Absolutely pure.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.760
And "Mangalo karo" "make it holy and make it beautiful".

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.240
So, this prayer is being sung

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.545
by the students who were studying semi-classical

00:35:54.545 --> 00:35:57.635
in raga Bhairavi and this will be the last song.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.460
In a bus and

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.440
we had a lot of discomfort

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.420
in the sense that we were not feeling free.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.920
But when we came into this wonderful land of Italy,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:45.020
we were feeling very, very free and we were also feeling very hungry.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.100
Maybe, it has to do something with the Nabhi, I'm sure.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.020
But then, in order to keep my "Sangeet Sarita" members happy,

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.400
I was trying to sing a raga which is known as Chandrakauns.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.160
It's a very, very dynamic raga.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.600
And close to that raga is another raga known as Malkauns.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.800
And there is a difference of only one note in these two ragas.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:21.440
And, as I was singing I was talking to Guruji and I was saying

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.900
that if we add this note of one raga into another,

00:43:25.905 --> 00:43:28.675
I think we will create a beautiful raga.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:33.200
And he immediately got up and he started singing

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.360
with that additional note and a new raga was born.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.420
Just, just in the bus, a new raga was born.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.560
And then,

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:50.880
we had to give a name and Guruji gave a very, very dynamic very sahaj name:

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.480
he called it "Chaitanya Ranjani" [vibrations; to be rejoiced]

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.940
which will entertain your Chaitanya.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.240
This is a raga which is going to be played for the first time.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:08.160
Even in India, my sister will bear me out that this has not been played before, anywhere.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.940
So, you can imagine what's a headache is done to this poor Babamama

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.960
who knew very little about music.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.900
He's gone so dynamic that he is creating ragas!

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:33.060
This will be played to you by one and only Guruji on the violin

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.340
and our young artist Nasir khan.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.240
Guido, could you please take down completely ...

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.580
as it is obstructing the view.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.220
It has to be removed completely.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.340
I was discussing this raga with my

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.380
other sister; where is she? I can't see.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.660
She must be sitting on side.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.580
So, she was saying as to: "How could you create this raga?"

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:59.040
And she herself replied: "It is because of your concentration in music."

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.020
"That,

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:07.140
that is because you put your heart and soul in something and you will achieve."

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.900
So, when you have to have creativity,

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.200
your attention is the most important equipment.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.140
So, you put your attention on something and you are bound to create

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.140
if your attention is fully on that subject.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.280
Out of the twelve brothers and sisters that we are,

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.360
my dear sister is a subtle artist and was blessed with this voice and the gift of music

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.700
and we used to have music every day in the house.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.040
I was a very playful boy, but in between, I used to go and listen to this music.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.360
And that has been registered with me and it is coming so helpful now

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.200
so that we can transfer this culture of India through this music

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.355
to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.080
It's a tremendous feeling.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.780
Now, I will first tell you as to what the two ragas are

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.800
and then I will tell you how they have been blended.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.740
So you will be able to appreciate the difference.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:58.560
First, a very brief introduction of the members of the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita who are on the stage:

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.300
Sandesh Popatkar on the tabla.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.220
Then,

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.280
Then our Guruji mister Prabhakarji [Dhakde] on the violin.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:38.000
And, two years ago this young artist Nasir Khan was here, he was then the baby

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.600
of the team.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.080
He has lost that status of being a baby because he's become,

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.700
he is going to become a father very shortly.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.980
And- but his sitar has improved immensely

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.480
over the two years.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:10.220
And now I will ask Prabhakarji to first play the ragas as they are.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.060
The two ragas.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.980
Now, first, he will play the Chandrakauns.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.600
One minute, the tuning.

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.580
Now, this is Chandrakauns he is playing.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.800
Now, this is the original raga, Chandrakauns.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.200
Pakad notation [unsure]

00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.200
Acha [Hindi]. Now, I'll ask Nasir to play Malkauns.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.040
See the notation.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.420
The only difference of one note.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:27.160
Now, the new raga. Only the notations.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:05.300
OK. Now, the "Chaitanya Ranjani" for your Chaitanya. Thank you.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.860
Antonio, people here can come here in the front.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:03.460
Shri Mataji has suggested

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.360
a new name for this raga.

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:10.320
Since this is a gift from the disciple to the guru,

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:15.800
and guru is synonymous of Purnima that is the full Moon,

01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:19.960
Shri Mataji says that this raga should be called

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.820
"Chaitanya Purnima", that means-

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.280
I think this is the biggest award

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.035
a disciple can expect from a guru

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.940
that She has blessed this raga with a very wonderful name.

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.480
Jai Shri Mataji.

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.780
You are lucky because Shri Mataji is speaking about you.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.180
All of you.

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:00.200
Chers amis, [Dear friends,]

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.180
bonsoir. [good night.]

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.560
Thank you.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.560
[No sound.]

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.840
Because I wanted to drive in Rome, I wanted to drive, so I said:

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.860
"We will take the car."

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.860
So we took the car

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:34.640
and as you know that it's very difficult to find parking in Rome,

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.180
like in Paris, yes.

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.260
More difficult.

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:45.980
So, for about twenty minutes,

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.200
we went around, around and around

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.940
looking for a parking place.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.120
Twenty minutes later, I suddenly noticed

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.480
a small gap in front of the restaurant.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.380
I took my car and I went into this gap.

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.520
And in front,

01:41:15.595 --> 01:41:19.055
there was a poster of Shri Mataji smiling.

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:44.840
The smile on that poster was very knowing.

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:51.480
I'm very-

01:41:53.455 --> 01:41:56.915
I'm very touched and very moved

01:41:57.195 --> 01:41:58.875
that

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.560
we have been chosen as one of the musicians

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.660
to play in this

01:42:09.235 --> 01:42:11.215
elated evening.

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.500
Indian classical music is based on ragas,

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.180
melodies which we call ragas,

01:42:27.185 --> 01:42:30.025
and ragas are emotions,

01:42:30.485 --> 01:42:33.945
ragas are mood, it's an emotion.

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:38.600
And different ragas have different emotions.

01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.720
And this evening, I chose to play a raga

01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:48.840
called Puriya, raga Puriya.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.840
[No sound.]

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.360
Tomorrow is, as you know, we are going to celebrate the Guru Purnima.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.100
And all these artists, whom you see here,

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:36.840
have become such great artists

01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:41.240
because of their dedication - of course through the art- but through their gurus.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.860
Complete dedication.

01:43:43.255 --> 01:43:46.695
And this is the key of their success:

01:43:47.145 --> 01:43:50.465
complete dedication to the guru.

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.140
And to master any art,

01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:59.220
you have to have dedication and surrendering.

01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:05.280
And that's how these people have achieved such heights of perfection.

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.940
That they have followed their gurus

01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.480
out and out absolutely, completely surrendering.

01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:17.380
And that is why today I'm happy that we have so many artists here, especially

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.840
such a great artist

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.220
of such fame before you.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.540
But if you ask him, he 'll tell you that

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.900
he had to go through penance

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.560
to master this art.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:34.100
And his own father is his guru.

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:38.380
So what a difficult situation must be for the father or for the son.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.495
But as far as the art is concerned,

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.240
there is no compromise.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.760
In the same way, as fas as spirituality is concerned,

01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:49.080
there is no compromise.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.980
Maybe, your guru is your Mother, but still,

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.360
no compromise.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.300
So, may God bless you.

03:33:25.440 --> 03:33:28.780
Thank you very much for appreciating him so much.

03:33:28.780 --> 03:33:30.875
Actually,

03:33:32.980 --> 03:33:36.200
it is a tremendous speed, you see

03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:38.715
the speed with which and the balance.

03:33:38.715 --> 03:33:41.435
Balance and the speed.

03:33:41.440 --> 03:33:45.400
We are living in an age of, we are living in an age of a jet, you see,

03:33:45.500 --> 03:33:47.960
we're living in an age of speed

03:33:48.040 --> 03:33:52.300
and in that speed, we have to keep the balance and the rhythm.

03:33:52.780 --> 03:33:55.215
That's what you have to learn

03:33:55.220 --> 03:33:59.640
is to keep the balance and the rhythm and then you have to come to the first beat,

03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:01.800
that is the Spirit.

03:34:02.220 --> 03:34:07.040
So, how you are bound, may go anywhere with any speed,

03:34:07.820 --> 03:34:10.120
keep the speed, keep the balance

03:34:10.240 --> 03:34:13.020
and come back to the same

03:34:13.340 --> 03:34:17.800
first beat which is the Spirit,

03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:20.000
is the- that's how it works out.

03:34:22.180 --> 03:34:25.660
And the speed with which he is playing, I tell you, this is a

03:34:27.540 --> 03:34:30.660
very great, modern also, a kind of a blessing

03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:33.280
that there is a speed in the atmosphere.

03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:36.115
And everywhere there's speed and -

03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:39.520
but in that speed to have the balance is only possible

03:34:40.140 --> 03:34:40.960
when

03:34:41.445 --> 03:34:44.055
you practice what you call "riyaz"

03:34:44.055 --> 03:34:47.185
is quite deep and you do it with your

03:34:47.315 --> 03:34:49.815
whole attention and whole heart.

03:34:49.820 --> 03:34:50.840
Then only,

03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:54.120
otherwise it's not possible such a speed that he has.

03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:57.695
What a tremendous speed! [Hindi]

03:35:00.820 --> 03:35:05.380
Speed [inaudible] - you see,  have you noticed the speed with which he was playing?

03:35:05.380 --> 03:35:07.380
And have you noticed the balance that he had?

03:35:07.385 --> 03:35:09.280
And how he was rhythmic?

03:35:09.395 --> 03:35:12.135
Rhythm, he never missed, you see, he's very  good

03:35:12.220 --> 03:35:15.340
as we call it the [inaudible]

03:35:15.640 --> 03:35:18.100
like.

03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:22.400
So he is, tablavala is another -

03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:23.340
Tablavala is very sahaj Mother.

03:35:23.340 --> 03:35:24.120
Sahaj!

03:35:24.120 --> 03:35:25.800
And he is absolutely relaxed

03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:27.860
and he is playing so well. He's beautiful.

03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:33.100
And that is what kind of a tablavala you need for a music like this

03:35:33.100 --> 03:35:33.620
where

03:35:33.780 --> 03:35:37.100
he has to be most unassuming and he is supporting

03:35:37.100 --> 03:35:39.920
all the time the artist, should be the point.

03:35:40.615 --> 03:35:43.945
I'm very happy you all are enjoying it so much

03:35:43.985 --> 03:35:47.105
and that you are appreciative of it

03:35:47.185 --> 03:35:49.145
cause, after all, it's a -

03:35:49.145 --> 03:35:52.365
we have been brought up in this kind of [inaudible] style.

03:35:52.365 --> 03:35:56.560
In my family, from my childhood, I have been earing nothing but classical music

03:35:56.560 --> 03:35:59.120
and all my life.

03:35:59.120 --> 03:36:01.500
I've never known even one minute in my house

03:36:01.500 --> 03:36:03.380
then where the music is not there:

03:36:03.380 --> 03:36:06.140
somebody singing in this room or somebody singing in that room,

03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:08.940
whatever may be the situation, there is music on.

03:36:09.100 --> 03:36:13.740
So, for my ear it is tremendous but to my heart also.

03:36:13.740 --> 03:36:17.500
And the way he has played, I must thank him very much on your behalf.

03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:20.860
From his heart, he has played, from his heart.

03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:24.820
It's only to her presence that this can happen.

03:36:25.100 --> 03:36:26.820
You all know this also.

03:39:21.660 --> 03:39:26.900
"Avion" [plane] means "air" isn't it? "Wind" in French.

03:39:28.200 --> 03:39:30.060
"Avion" is wind.

03:39:30.060 --> 03:39:32.920
He says it is "guide" "avion" is "guide"

03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:34.920
No, "avion", "avion".

03:39:35.060 --> 03:39:35.840
"Avion"?

03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:36.940
Is what?

03:39:36.940 --> 03:39:38.060
"Avion" is airplane.

03:39:38.060 --> 03:39:42.180
Airplane. There's a lot of "avion" in the Avignon.

03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:31.680
If you see, the sitar he has got

03:40:31.680 --> 03:40:33.660
a rakhi to it, you see?

03:40:33.815 --> 03:40:36.235
You all know what is rakhi is.

03:40:36.235 --> 03:40:38.985
So the sitar is his sister.

03:40:39.240 --> 03:40:43.440
And the sisterly love is the purity of love,

03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:45.320
absolute, pure love, you see.

03:40:45.320 --> 03:40:47.820
And the sister is the protector of the brother.

03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:51.880
So, this is how they tie rakhi to a sister, you see?

03:40:52.500 --> 03:40:54.540
I hope you have noticed it.

03:40:54.540 --> 03:40:56.540
[Hindi]

03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:35.720
There is a circus on

03:42:35.900 --> 03:42:39.760
and it's a nice contrast to see the difference between the two.

03:43:21.880 --> 03:43:24.575
This is the raga which is called as Durga

03:43:24.575 --> 03:43:26.955
as you must have heard it before also

03:43:27.020 --> 03:43:29.140
and it's quite a difficult raga and

03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:34.120
also it is only with the five notes it is played

03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:36.280
and there are very few ragas like that.

03:43:36.875 --> 03:43:40.335
And one of them is Gunakali raga.

03:43:40.615 --> 03:43:43.315
which is also played with the same style.

03:43:43.415 --> 03:43:45.465
And I was surprised that

03:43:45.465 --> 03:43:47.915
in certain countries,

03:43:47.920 --> 03:43:50.980
they only know one raga.

03:43:50.980 --> 03:43:55.600
Like Bhairava, it's a - it's the only raga they know in Iran.

03:43:55.700 --> 03:43:58.375
Whether it is morning, evening, afternoon,

03:43:58.375 --> 03:44:01.575
they sing just that one raga is Bhairava.

03:44:01.580 --> 03:44:04.780
And I was surprised, I heard Gunakali in Japan.

03:44:04.820 --> 03:44:05.380
Ah, ah.

03:44:05.380 --> 03:44:09.100
Japanse have only idea of Gunakali, I don't know how they got it.

03:44:09.440 --> 03:44:11.640
But only Gunakali nothing else.

03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:12.360
Absolutely.

03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:15.600
Absolutely. That's all. One raga they are masters.

03:44:15.760 --> 03:44:16.560
They are mastering that raga.

03:44:16.680 --> 03:44:19.320
One, but morning, evening, [Hindi]

03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:24.740
And in a way, these ragas are morning ragas.  [Hindi]

03:44:25.700 --> 03:44:28.940
Bhairava especially is a raga

03:44:29.100 --> 03:44:32.600
all the time they sing without any discrimination.

03:44:34.860 --> 03:44:37.520
But this is the time for Durga really.

03:44:38.885 --> 03:44:40.535
Just before awakening,

03:44:41.160 --> 03:44:45.960
the mother is calling that: "Get up now and meditate."

03:44:50.580 --> 03:44:51.700
Ah!

03:44:52.180 --> 03:44:54.800
How beautiful it is, just see.

04:25:43.500 --> 04:25:47.920
Now, their last raga is Bhairavi.

04:25:47.920 --> 04:25:49.920
It has to be played in the old

04:25:49.920 --> 04:25:51.920
traditional ways and

04:25:51.920 --> 04:25:56.760
it's a raga that is in praise of the power of,

04:25:59.260 --> 04:26:01.080
we can say,

04:26:01.480 --> 04:26:02.920
of the Spirit.

04:26:02.920 --> 04:26:08.960
Because it is a- it has such beautiful notes and

04:26:08.960 --> 04:26:10.960
[Hindi].

04:26:12.580 --> 04:26:17.100
Notes which are - it's a complete "sampurna"

04:26:17.100 --> 04:26:19.100
it's a complete "aga" it's a "Purnima". Hey?

04:26:19.100 --> 04:26:20.260
[Babamama in Hindi]

04:26:20.260 --> 04:26:23.700
All the twelves notes are in it. So, you see,

04:26:23.700 --> 04:26:29.120
it's such a complete raga and it has to be played in all due respect to it.

04:26:29.120 --> 04:26:31.120
And it is a ragani Shri Mataji.

04:26:31.120 --> 04:26:33.480
It's a ragani regarded as you see, because

04:26:35.620 --> 04:26:40.040
Now, as you know that the heart chakra has got -

04:26:40.040 --> 04:26:43.300
heart chakra has got twelve petals.

04:26:44.440 --> 04:26:46.440
And the Durga resides on the heart chakra.

04:26:47.960 --> 04:26:53.420
Now, the Durga's qualities are that she is protective of her children.

04:26:54.300 --> 04:26:57.420
She's very gentle, very soft with her children.

04:26:57.980 --> 04:27:05.660
And she is extremely horrifying to the crooks, to the satanic people, to the negative people.

04:27:05.660 --> 04:27:09.180
So, in this raga, I think because the-

04:27:09.460 --> 04:27:11.360
there are - it's spaced out,

04:27:11.660 --> 04:27:15.360
the notes are spaced out.

04:27:15.360 --> 04:27:18.580
So, either you could play it slow or you could play it fast.

04:27:18.580 --> 04:27:19.900
Nothing in between.

04:27:20.100 --> 04:27:22.640
That's why it is on a Durga style, you see.

04:27:22.640 --> 04:27:25.300
Either she's extremely gentle

04:27:25.300 --> 04:27:27.600
or she is extremely horrifying.

04:27:28.320 --> 04:27:32.440
So, because she has a double function, is one is to look after her children

04:27:32.440 --> 04:27:37.640
and another is: protect her children from the devils.

04:27:37.640 --> 04:27:40.240
So she has to be very quick about it

04:27:40.240 --> 04:27:45.220
to fight them and to, in every way, to frighten them

04:27:45.540 --> 04:27:47.600
and to be alert about them.

04:27:48.180 --> 04:27:51.060
So, in the second part, you all became very alert I saw it.

04:27:51.140 --> 04:27:53.320
The first part, you were having a lullaby

04:27:53.460 --> 04:27:57.040
because it was the mother's love that was playing.

04:27:57.300 --> 04:27:58.920
But the second part, you became alert

04:27:58.920 --> 04:28:00.920
because she has to fight.

04:28:01.380 --> 04:28:06.260
Now, this is such a nice raga

04:28:06.260 --> 04:28:10.920
because it gives you a better sense of security

04:28:10.920 --> 04:28:12.180
within yourselves.

04:28:12.520 --> 04:28:14.920
Will give you a sense of security.

04:28:14.920 --> 04:28:19.240
And also as you know, medically that it's important to build up this chakra

04:28:19.720 --> 04:28:22.960
because that gives you antibodies created more

04:28:23.240 --> 04:28:26.400
so to fight all the diseases, to fight all the foreign things

04:28:26.400 --> 04:28:28.400
which try to attack us.

04:28:28.400 --> 04:28:31.420
So, this raga is so apt, absolutely apt

04:28:31.420 --> 04:28:37.420
for today's atmosphere and for today's need,

04:28:37.420 --> 04:28:41.680
that we have to have the security of the Mother and the protection of the Mother.

04:28:42.220 --> 04:28:45.400
And that all the evil forces must be finished from this world.

04:28:45.400 --> 04:28:48.720
And that's how this raga has a very great significance

04:28:48.800 --> 04:28:52.480
and I thank you very much for feeling this raga,

04:28:52.480 --> 04:28:53.340
see.

04:29:02.200 --> 04:29:05.860
This is the now last five minutes he would like to play,

04:29:05.860 --> 04:29:07.860
he asked the Bhairavi

04:29:09.520 --> 04:29:13.360
which is a complete raga as you can call, is the complete Purnima.

04:29:13.660 --> 04:29:17.420
All the - all the notes are there.

04:29:18.000 --> 04:29:23.480
And it is played in various ways, is in various styles and

04:29:24.060 --> 04:29:28.860
is used for so many expressions of

04:29:29.240 --> 04:29:31.660
your feelings and things.

04:29:32.300 --> 04:29:36.940
But in this also, there's a beautiful one of a song as you know

04:29:37.420 --> 04:29:39.420
Dayani Bhavani is the one

04:29:40.160 --> 04:29:43.520
which is a song about the Mother Goddess.

04:29:44.300 --> 04:29:48.860
And in this [inaudible] there's a little mixture in the-

04:29:49.140 --> 04:29:50.300
I don't know if it is an

04:29:50.300 --> 04:29:51.800
absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

04:29:53.900 --> 04:29:55.840
[Hindi]

04:29:55.840 --> 04:29:58.880
It is to be played absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi.

04:29:58.880 --> 04:30:00.880
[Hindi]

04:30:10.880 --> 04:30:13.960
It should be played in absolute Shuddha Bhairavi.

04:30:13.960 --> 04:30:15.960
[Hindi]

04:30:28.300 --> 04:30:30.300
It is to be played absolutely in pure Bhairavi.

04:30:30.300 --> 04:30:31.740
This is the best way

04:30:31.840 --> 04:30:34.300
because Bhairavi is the name of the Goddess.

04:30:34.700 --> 04:30:35.980
So, that will be the-

04:30:37.940 --> 04:30:40.300
[Hindi]

04:30:40.700 --> 04:30:45.080
So, this is the purity of it, purity of it creates that

04:30:45.880 --> 04:30:48.100
feeling and that-

04:30:49.380 --> 04:30:54.400
I mean it awakens that Deity so that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

04:31:15.260 --> 04:31:21.720
Ah! She, my sister is accepting that they may make some mistakes in the Shuddhata [unsure].

04:31:32.520 --> 04:31:36.400
Which I detected, you see, I'm not such a musician as you are,

04:31:36.400 --> 04:31:40.300
but I did detect that there's a little bit [inaudible]

04:32:02.140 --> 04:32:06.400
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, I mean, such a lot of freedom.

04:32:06.660 --> 04:32:08.920
Ah! You can do what you like with it but

04:32:08.920 --> 04:32:12.100
only thing that you have to keep to the ragas

04:32:12.200 --> 04:32:16.780
and you have to keep to the "swaras" [notes] and everything and

04:32:17.420 --> 04:32:21.660
it cannot just go crazy from one to another like that.

04:32:22.040 --> 04:32:25.080
So, it is like a big aeroplane which is going in the air

04:32:25.080 --> 04:32:29.400
with everything completely fixed properly, you see, so it can go anywhere.

04:32:29.940 --> 04:32:33.400
Unless and until you it's fixed by its own maryadas, it cannot go.

04:32:33.980 --> 04:32:37.120
So, that has to be there. So first, the ragas are built.

04:32:37.180 --> 04:32:40.000
And built in such a way that they are absolutely perfect.

04:32:40.040 --> 04:32:42.920
And then you can go wherever you feel like, nothing will happen.

04:32:44.020 --> 04:32:45.600
[Hindi]

04:33:39.420 --> 04:33:41.480
Then it will become jazz Shri Mataji.

04:33:41.480 --> 04:33:43.480
Jazz. Or even worse than that, could be.

04:33:56.680 --> 04:33:58.680
Ah, ah.

04:33:59.760 --> 04:34:03.500
First, he will play all the twelves notes which are moved in Bhairavi.

04:34:03.500 --> 04:34:06.620
And then you see how he keeps to them.

04:34:06.620 --> 04:34:10.060
He keeps to that mood that way.

04:34:14.060 --> 04:34:16.060
Woah, wah.

04:34:18.780 --> 04:34:22.460
It's the heart chakra. it's the heart chakra of Shiva.

04:36:34.500 --> 04:36:36.500
Surrendering.

04:36:41.560 --> 04:36:44.880
The surrendering, you see, as Islam means "surrender".

04:36:45.020 --> 04:36:48.400
Islam is the "surrender".

04:42:26.460 --> 04:42:29.320
He's been calling [inaudible].

04:42:53.500 --> 04:42:55.840
Now, this is the call  [inaudible].

05:20:27.660 --> 05:20:30.060
What an enjoyment! What an enjoyment!

05:20:30.740 --> 05:20:32.740
Tremendous!

05:21:23.320 --> 05:21:25.540
Please, be seated.

05:21:29.140 --> 05:21:32.400
I have to especially thank him for one thing

05:21:32.980 --> 05:21:36.640
that he has now prepared really for you,

05:21:36.940 --> 05:21:38.940
the Guru Purnima for you.

05:21:39.360 --> 05:21:41.460
He's worked it out really very well.

05:21:41.460 --> 05:21:44.140
I can see that, I can feel it.

05:21:44.800 --> 05:21:50.160
It has worked within ourselves that depth and that beauty.

05:21:50.700 --> 05:21:56.780
And now with music, you see, it's this excavation within ourselves, you see.

05:21:57.420 --> 05:21:59.800
Facing it within yourself.

05:21:59.840 --> 05:22:04.040
All these things with music become

05:22:04.040 --> 05:22:07.380
not only harmless but also so gentle,

05:22:07.380 --> 05:22:09.380
that you don't feel that it is happening.

05:22:09.380 --> 05:22:11.140
It just works.

05:22:11.320 --> 05:22:16.380
You see, the- like very gentle waves you see, it works within you and

05:22:16.800 --> 05:22:20.700
you start developing that personality which is very important

05:22:20.700 --> 05:22:22.700
for a function like Guru Purnima.

05:22:22.700 --> 05:22:29.160
And the beauty and the joy

05:22:29.160 --> 05:22:33.360
they all work it out so beautifully that you don't feel that it is all working,

05:22:33.360 --> 05:22:35.080
but I know it's really.

05:22:35.080 --> 05:22:41.240
But, supposing, if I say something as a Guru, maybe I may hurt you.

05:22:41.240 --> 05:22:47.820
You may feel upset and you also may feel facing yourself

05:22:47.940 --> 05:22:51.220
a little bit, sometimes reluctant maybe diffident.

05:22:51.840 --> 05:22:56.100
You might feel little sort of dejected or depressed.

05:22:56.620 --> 05:23:00.660
Or you may feel sometimes also if elevate you

05:23:00.720 --> 05:23:03.160
you might feel egoistical, you see.

05:23:03.160 --> 05:23:10.540
So the words could be, could not render service as properly as the notes can

05:23:10.540 --> 05:23:14.140
because the notes just penetrate within you

05:23:14.160 --> 05:23:19.380
and work it out so smoothly  that you don't feel it's working there.

05:23:19.380 --> 05:23:21.340
It's working no doubt.

05:23:21.340 --> 05:23:24.040
It's like mantras it works, like mantras only.

05:23:24.780 --> 05:23:30.220
And when it's enlightened notes, it has great effect.

05:23:30.960 --> 05:23:33.140
I haven't brought you photographs

05:23:33.140 --> 05:23:35.140
where, when you are playing before Me,

05:23:35.140 --> 05:23:37.140
you go into complete lights.

05:23:38.480 --> 05:23:40.480
I have got those photographs with Me.

05:23:40.480 --> 05:23:43.300
Of course, also we have got  the [inaudible]

05:23:43.640 --> 05:23:47.340
And we have got photographs, now, tomorrow we will be able to show you,

05:23:47.340 --> 05:23:50.580
where the lights change their forms,

05:23:50.580 --> 05:23:53.880
how through vibrations, how they change their forms, you see.

05:23:54.520 --> 05:23:57.680
And how the vibrations work it out, you see?

05:23:58.400 --> 05:24:03.240
But the, even the notes are used by vibrations as "vahanas" [vessel]

05:24:04.020 --> 05:24:06.360
The notes are used and the notes

05:24:06.360 --> 05:24:11.140
take the "vahanas" position

05:24:11.140 --> 05:24:12.820
and they penetrate.

05:24:12.820 --> 05:24:17.000
When there is somebody: you are singing before a Realized soul

05:24:17.000 --> 05:24:20.020
or an evolved personality,

05:24:20.020 --> 05:24:25.400
then the Chaitanya flows within you.

05:24:25.400 --> 05:24:29.200
But notes are very helpful, I've seen, the beautiful notes,

05:24:29.200 --> 05:24:30.720
and in harmony, you see.

05:24:30.860 --> 05:24:32.820
It's so much in harmony with you,

05:24:32.820 --> 05:24:34.820
that you don't feel the penetration.

05:24:35.540 --> 05:24:42.180
You don't feel the injection, you don't feel the going within you.

05:24:42.180 --> 05:24:44.320
Just it works and it just moves and

05:24:44.620 --> 05:24:47.360
I was seeing your brain also opening out quite a lot

05:24:47.620 --> 05:24:50.420
because the heart is so much connected with your brain now,

05:24:50.500 --> 05:24:52.020
you are integrated.

05:24:52.020 --> 05:24:55.040
So it's wonderful and you are all becoming thoughtless

05:24:55.040 --> 05:24:56.600
and beautiful.

05:24:56.700 --> 05:25:00.820
I think you all have enjoyed his things and we have to thank him very much

05:25:01.180 --> 05:25:04.540
because our Guru Purnima day that he agreed to come

05:25:05.060 --> 05:25:08.540
and has done the job halfway for Me.

05:25:08.540 --> 05:25:14.680
I'm thankful to him that now, even if I say something, you won't feel hurt.

05:25:31.020 --> 05:25:33.880
It is nice to be a Mother.

05:25:33.880 --> 05:25:38.020
Mother is a very easy thing, it's to just to express your love and

05:25:38.180 --> 05:25:39.840
the children are nice.

05:25:39.920 --> 05:25:43.340
But for a Mother to be a Guru is the most difficult task.

05:25:43.340 --> 05:25:47.640
And that, if I have to do, a Mother to be a Guru,

05:25:47.640 --> 05:25:50.960
then I think this preparation is a very good idea because

05:25:50.960 --> 05:25:53.540
first of all, now, you are smoothed out

05:25:53.540 --> 05:25:55.900
and you are much better

05:25:56.000 --> 05:25:58.940
so it's all right, as a Guru I can tell you some things.

05:25:59.080 --> 05:26:03.600
Otherwise, for a Mother to be Guru is the worst thing that she can do

05:26:03.680 --> 05:26:08.540
and to act as a Guru but sometimes, you have to be corrected.

05:26:09.880 --> 05:26:15.080
But I think this one has created a beautiful atmosphere and I am very thankful to him

05:26:15.080 --> 05:26:17.080
for this preparation

05:26:17.080 --> 05:26:19.760
of your minds and your brains.

05:26:19.760 --> 05:26:25.200
We are very honoured and, as I said in the beginning, I'm extremely honoured.

05:26:25.940 --> 05:26:30.480
And, of course, it's very difficult to use words

05:26:30.480 --> 05:26:34.100
on how I feel at this moment.

05:26:34.100 --> 05:26:38.520
Because to be invited to play for Guru Purnima

05:26:38.520 --> 05:26:41.220
is a great blessing for us.

05:26:41.220 --> 05:26:45.540
And it's your blessing and it's a great honour and

05:26:45.540 --> 05:26:50.100
we would have been very disappointed if you had not invited us to play today.

05:26:50.340 --> 05:26:53.420
I was anxious that you should be invited actually.

05:26:53.420 --> 05:26:53.920
Thank you.

05:26:53.920 --> 05:26:56.460
That you should be here and you should do this

05:26:56.460 --> 05:27:00.360
because you see, if you have seen the mid-career that you do

05:27:00.460 --> 05:27:04.800
with that you were pulling the strings of their hearts, I could see it clearly

05:27:04.920 --> 05:27:05.880
the importance, you see.

05:27:06.900 --> 05:27:11.600
Some or other, I thought I can work through you better

05:27:11.600 --> 05:27:14.560
than through my own words directly.

05:27:15.520 --> 05:27:18.900
It's an indirect way of working out things like this

05:27:18.900 --> 05:27:21.400
and you have been very, very helpful,  cooperative.

05:27:21.900 --> 05:27:24.300
I'm thankful to you for this wisdom.

05:27:24.300 --> 05:27:27.120
So, I don't know how to also

05:27:27.120 --> 05:27:29.320
say something about

05:27:29.320 --> 05:27:31.320
Indian music.

05:27:31.320 --> 05:27:33.340
But I can definitely say

05:27:33.340 --> 05:27:36.800
that the way you are appreciating Indian music

05:27:36.900 --> 05:27:38.900
is really very creditable.

05:27:38.900 --> 05:27:44.500
I just can't understand really how you people are so much appreciative of this music.

05:27:44.500 --> 05:27:46.500
I'm just- it's the Spirit

05:27:46.500 --> 05:27:48.500
or whatever you may say

05:27:48.500 --> 05:27:53.160
it's something remarkable and even the artists are so enamoured by that.

05:27:53.240 --> 05:27:54.240
To see such a -

05:27:54.240 --> 05:27:54.740
Absolutely.

05:27:54.860 --> 05:27:56.820
Absolutely. They're having rapport and all that.

05:27:56.820 --> 05:27:58.340
They are very much enamoured by you.

05:27:58.480 --> 05:27:59.080
Wonderful.

05:27:59.080 --> 05:28:05.260
And they are very thankful to you the way you are just following every note and every movement

05:28:06.140 --> 05:28:10.060
with such intense concentration.

05:28:12.060 --> 05:28:16.300
But it's your blessings Mataji, it's your blessing that this whole atmosphere

05:28:16.380 --> 05:28:16.920
Yes.

05:28:16.920 --> 05:28:18.700
worked out like this.  Otherwise...

05:28:18.700 --> 05:28:22.420
Really more for - I don't know whom to thank. You or their aim.

05:28:22.420 --> 05:28:26.200
But I think it is mutual thanking is needed

05:28:26.200 --> 05:28:28.500
because you were enjoying him and he was enjoying you.

05:28:28.500 --> 05:28:30.780
Otherwise, it would not have been possible.

05:28:30.780 --> 05:28:35.640
Without a proper audience, artist also doesn't get the encouragement to play so well.

05:28:35.640 --> 05:28:37.360
[Hindi]

05:28:37.360 --> 05:28:40.080
Audience has to have a rapport otherwise

05:28:40.220 --> 05:28:43.400
[Hindi]

05:28:52.940 --> 05:28:55.560
You have not put anything for the Russians so far here?

05:28:55.560 --> 05:28:57.560
There are too many there, it seems.

05:29:00.300 --> 05:29:03.040
Just simple thing like that.

05:29:03.040 --> 05:29:05.040
Moscow and then Kyiv.

05:29:05.040 --> 05:29:07.040
Moscow, Leningrad.

05:29:07.040 --> 05:29:09.040
Kyiv also.

05:29:12.140 --> 05:29:16.660
[Hindi]

05:29:21.700 --> 05:29:24.140
A little gift for him from you all.

05:29:26.660 --> 05:29:30.900
Only what I can tell him is to keep the music on.

05:29:32.160 --> 05:29:34.160
[Hindi]

05:30:10.000 --> 05:30:13.680
So, now for- what should I say?

05:30:13.680 --> 05:30:15.660
"Good morning" to you?

05:30:16.820 --> 05:30:19.660
I think still that will be about -

05:30:19.660 --> 05:30:21.660
till twelve o'clock you can have rest.

05:30:21.660 --> 05:30:23.380
Then we'll see you. All right?

05:30:23.380 --> 05:30:25.160
May God bless you. Thank you

05:30:25.660 --> 05:30:27.660
