WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:12.722
Today we all Sahaja Yogis are standing
on the brink of the ocean,

00:13.952 --> 00:18.284
ocean of humanity,

00:20.281 --> 00:28.763
where we have to face the problems
of human beings.

00:28.964 --> 00:35.103
Otherwise, in the nature there are no
problems, they are all already solved.

00:37.694 --> 00:40.858
So one has to understand that

00:41.059 --> 00:51.776
it’s not just a movement of few people,
chosen people,

00:51.977 --> 00:57.329
just to achieve Self-realisation,

00:57.529 --> 01:02.899
but it’s a big revolution

01:04.464 --> 01:10.388
which has to bring forth the beauties
of human beings,

01:10.568 --> 01:19.580
the glories of human beings, the proof
of divinity,

01:19.780 --> 01:26.137
of divine power and of God Almighty.

01:26.991 --> 01:31.722
We have to now face that multitude
of people

01:31.923 --> 01:36.108
who are absolutely ignorant compared
to you,

01:36.309 --> 01:39.976
who have not known the knowledge of God,

01:40.177 --> 01:49.728
who are either lost into the darkness
of ignorance

01:49.929 --> 01:56.745
or are burning in the fire of ego.

02:00.508 --> 02:05.506
We have to transform this world into
a new world,

02:05.707 --> 02:13.681
a beautiful world which you all are
enjoying,

02:13.893 --> 02:21.657
to establish it, to be established on this
earth,

02:21.858 --> 02:25.792
for which we have to prepare ourselves.

02:25.993 --> 02:29.617
So far Sahaj Yoga means blessings;

02:29.818 --> 02:35.113
if somebody is less blessed they ask Me
questions, “How is it, Mother,

02:35.314 --> 02:38.461
we haven’t got this when we are praying
to You?

02:38.662 --> 02:40.842
Why did it not work out?

02:41.043 --> 02:44.768
It should have happened, after all we
are worshipping You,

02:44.969 --> 02:50.970
so how is it that my son did not get
the job?”

02:53.206 --> 02:57.405
So, I mean, as if it’s sort of a, some
debts have to be paid

02:57.606 --> 03:01.180
to all the Sahaja Yogis by Sahaj Yoga.

03:01.381 --> 03:08.125
That sort of an attitude has been, so far,
towards Sahaj Yog.

03:08.737 --> 03:13.512
Of, not all of you, I must say,

03:14.150 --> 03:22.067
but in the minds there’s lurking always,
a desire to know

03:22.268 --> 03:28.054
why, when we are Sahaj Yogis, why should
it happen to us.

03:28.255 --> 03:32.227
You’ve seen that God has blessed you.

03:32.415 --> 03:38.414
Some people had very miserable married
life,

03:38.580 --> 03:43.765
they couldn’t understand why they had
to have a miserable married life.

03:43.965 --> 03:48.650
Some had some misfortunes

03:48.851 --> 03:55.416
and some had some diseases also after
coming to Sahaj Yoga.

03:55.573 --> 04:00.821
So there has to be understanding that
Sahaj Yoga is

04:01.022 --> 04:08.376
for correcting your life, for putting you
on solid basis,

04:08.553 --> 04:13.961
on proper foundations to make you
great people.

04:14.162 --> 04:19.153
As if it gets you immuned to all these
mishappenings,

04:19.346 --> 04:24.626
with blessings of course, so you don’t feel
the effects

04:24.850 --> 04:30.556
of those misfortunes so much as you would
normally feel.

04:30.757 --> 04:36.820
This creates beautiful human beings out
of you.

04:37.021 --> 04:40.944
Some people have hankering after money;

04:41.145 --> 04:45.108
some people think they can make money
by coming to Sahaj Yoga;

04:45.309 --> 04:51.135
some people think they will become leaders
or some think they will have fame,

04:51.336 --> 04:58.658
some think that they will achieve a kind
of a very dominant position;

04:58.858 --> 05:03.364
and some think that they can befool Me
also.

05:07.036 --> 05:11.957
It’s high time we realise that Sahaj Yoga
is not for this.

05:12.158 --> 05:15.940
Sahaj Yoga is for making you the wisest
person,

05:16.141 --> 05:23.437
the sanest person, the most generous and
the most confident person in the world,

05:23.637 --> 05:26.448
because you have to fight,

05:26.649 --> 05:30.966
you have to fight the dark ignorance
of Kali Yuga,

05:31.151 --> 05:38.600
of ages which is precipitated and today
we see all the bad effects of it.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.919
Whatever you may call it, you may call it
the fanaticism,

05:43.129 --> 05:48.537
you may call it the atheism, any isms
of any kinds,

05:48.738 --> 05:56.296
and all these human projections which
have created

05:56.497 --> 06:00.535
all those artificial webs have to be
broken.

06:00.770 --> 06:09.091
But human beings, on the whole, believe
that these artificial webs are real.

06:09.394 --> 06:11.921
So to break that,

06:12.122 --> 06:16.976
you have to be also be careful that you
don’t break the human beings.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.338
While you are breaking their false faiths,

06:20.521 --> 06:26.456
you have to remember that those people
who are carrying those false faiths

06:26.657 --> 06:32.115
are the ones who have to achieve
Self-realisation.

06:32.316 --> 06:38.334
It’s a very delicate work, it’s a very hard
work, it’s a very harsh work

06:38.535 --> 06:42.820
but it is the most detached work.

06:43.021 --> 06:47.269
And when we realise that we are
so important,

06:47.470 --> 06:52.792
that God has blessed us with this peace,

06:52.993 --> 06:57.745
with this understanding, with these
powers -

06:57.945 --> 07:01.905
it’s not only for our own gain,

07:02.105 --> 07:08.695
because God is not only for you, He is
for the whole world.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.077
So we have to utilise them, we have
to spread them,

07:12.278 --> 07:17.577
work it out at every level; we have
to become dynamic about it.

07:17.778 --> 07:20.130
But the most important thing is
the responsibility

07:20.331 --> 07:24.212
of Sahaj Yoga we have to take.

07:24.680 --> 07:30.089
We are Sahaj Yogis and we are responsible
for Sahaj Yoga.

07:30.290 --> 07:33.158
What have we done for Sahaj Yoga?

07:33.358 --> 07:36.461
We looked after our family, our children,
our jobs,

07:36.662 --> 07:43.549
our this, our that, motorcars, our horses,
our dogs, our cats.

07:44.340 --> 07:48.658
But who is responsible for Sahaj Yoga?

07:50.495 --> 07:53.647
When it comes to that point, we are
responsible

07:53.848 --> 07:58.949
of Sahaj Yoga, then it works out.

07:59.172 --> 08:06.670
But there is a deliberate action also
of the negative forces.

08:06.871 --> 08:12.413
And this negativity is acting through
ignorant people who believe,

08:12.613 --> 08:15.190
who believe that they are right.

08:15.390 --> 08:19.644
They don’t know what is waiting for their
destruction there.

08:19.844 --> 08:26.311
Specially among our young people
you’ll find

08:26.511 --> 08:32.861
they just join any party, join any club,

08:33.062 --> 08:37.079
join any methods, any trend, anything,

08:37.280 --> 08:47.060
just because they have no understanding
as to what they have to be.

08:48.153 --> 08:51.764
They have to be the Spirit.

08:51.964 --> 08:56.872
I asked the other day a president of
a young organisation,

08:57.072 --> 09:01.013
“What is your policy?” He said,
“We have no policy.”

09:01.214 --> 09:04.690
They started looking here and there, [and]
said, “We have no policy.”

09:04.891 --> 09:09.407
I was amazed that they have no policy.

09:09.607 --> 09:13.875
“No, whatever our leaders say, we do it.”

09:14.075 --> 09:18.824
So to get people out of this kind
of slavery

09:19.025 --> 09:24.227
that they have no brains of their own,
they can’t use their own understanding,

09:24.427 --> 09:28.566
they have to become the Spirit.

09:28.905 --> 09:34.555
Shivaji who was a great Atma Sakshatkari,
a realised soul,

09:34.756 --> 09:37.173
for the future he has given the message.

09:37.347 --> 09:46.653
He said, “Svadharma jagwawa,” means
enlighten your dharma of Spirit.

09:46.854 --> 09:53.758
“Svadharma,” the Spirit has to be
enlightened.

09:54.790 --> 09:58.685
Everybody has said that. I’m specially
quoting him

09:58.885 --> 10:04.538
because he comes from Maharashtra; apart
from that he was a political head.

10:04.739 --> 10:09.223
Though he was a political head but because
he was a realised soul,

10:09.423 --> 10:14.423
he said that your Spirit should be
awakened.

10:14.623 --> 10:18.489
He didn’t talk of all other nonsensical
things.

10:18.690 --> 10:22.604
And he knew that unless and until
the Spirit is awakened,

10:22.805 --> 10:27.609
people will be doing all kinds of wrong
things.

10:27.810 --> 10:31.084
And that is why today we find all over
the world

10:31.284 --> 10:33.922
the mess in which all political parties,

10:34.122 --> 10:40.944
all economic endeavours, all military
endeavours have fallen into.

10:41.523 --> 10:50.131
So, it is for us to take over and to show
them what is an integrated life,

10:50.337 --> 10:57.372
and what is the strength of a human being.

10:57.573 --> 11:01.297
Because this Shakti is within everyone.

11:01.497 --> 11:06.131
Just praying to Shakti, just talking about
Shakti, it doesn’t act.

11:06.332 --> 11:15.409
But this divine Shakti has to act, and
act through you people.

11:16.282 --> 11:19.026
Just try to realise

11:19.227 --> 11:26.342
that within these few years how much
knowledge you have got,

11:28.035 --> 11:32.736
how much you know, how deeply you know.

11:32.937 --> 11:35.765
You are not just passing slogans
or talking, you know -

11:35.966 --> 11:40.480
but you know it, you know
what it is.

11:40.645 --> 11:44.168
I don’t think I have attended to each
one of you individually,

11:44.369 --> 11:47.323
but through your Spirit only you have
come to know

11:47.524 --> 11:51.048
all the knowledge about yourself and
knowledge about others.

11:51.249 --> 11:56.275
You didn’t have to go to any library, you
didn’t have to go to any university.

11:56.476 --> 11:58.560
All the saints never went,

11:58.761 --> 12:02.783
none of the saints went to any university
or read any books,

12:02.984 --> 12:07.364
but how knowledgeable they were, because
they were the Spirit.

12:07.565 --> 12:11.716
So the first and foremost responsibility
of a Sahaj Yogi

12:11.917 --> 12:17.165
on this day is to be the Spirit, on the day
when we are celebrating

12:17.366 --> 12:22.473
the birthday of Christ, who was the Spirit.

12:23.935 --> 12:27.635
So, this is our greatest responsibility
first to see that,

12:27.836 --> 12:35.517
“Are we the Spirit, or we are this body,
this mind, this ego? What are we?”

12:36.198 --> 12:40.927
If you have achieved that state,

12:41.689 --> 12:45.795
if you have achieved that state,

12:45.996 --> 12:49.511
then you are, as they call in Marathi,
samarthya,

12:49.712 --> 12:59.757
means, you are equal to your name;
that you are the Spirit.

13:00.831 --> 13:04.138
If you cannot achieve that,

13:04.339 --> 13:08.045
then you are a half-baked Sahaj Yogi,
not yet done.

13:08.252 --> 13:13.111
As you know, we have no organisations,
no memberships, nothing.

13:13.312 --> 13:21.917
But we have one thing, that we know
we are realised souls,

13:22.409 --> 13:29.540
that we know more than all others know,
and that we are not proud of it.

13:29.741 --> 13:33.273
We are very humble people.

13:33.438 --> 13:40.309
But this humility should not become
a stagnation or a lethargy within us that,

13:40.510 --> 13:47.943
“Now we are realised souls, let us sit
on a tree and have our blessings.”

13:49.862 --> 13:53.656
You have to get to the roots

13:53.857 --> 13:57.802
and you all have to work it out
on your level.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.507
But first get rid of your own personal
problems,

14:01.708 --> 14:05.763
all petty things that you have.

14:06.945 --> 14:09.713
When we talk of sacrifice, as you know,

14:09.914 --> 14:15.552
in Sahaj Yoga I have not known what
sacrifice people have done.

14:15.753 --> 14:19.947
You have to sacrifice your ego,

14:20.148 --> 14:24.582
which is a headache to you and to Me.

14:24.782 --> 14:27.289
And you have to sacrifice your
conditioning,

14:27.490 --> 14:32.546
only two things, left and right.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.478
And that can be achieved and many
have achieved [it],

14:37.679 --> 14:44.954
but now put that detached personality
to a test.

14:45.155 --> 14:50.645
And then, once you are sure that you
are detached,

14:50.910 --> 14:55.773
then employ your energy in doing

14:55.974 --> 15:05.837
constructive improvement of this whole
world.

15:06.186 --> 15:11.293
It will work out for poverty, it will
work out for politics,

15:11.494 --> 15:20.461
it will work out for economics, it will
work out for every field of life.

15:21.312 --> 15:27.268
Sahaj Yoga is the only solution because
in this human beings are transformed.

15:27.469 --> 15:34.638
It’s not like this, that one person changes
the address

15:34.860 --> 15:40.865
or the badge that he is wearing, and he
becomes something else.

15:41.066 --> 15:46.560
Or from church to temple and temple
to church.

15:46.790 --> 15:52.631
It’s something within that transforms you,
makes you knowledgeable.

15:52.846 --> 15:58.636
So you are already Sat Chit Ananda; because
you know the truth,

15:58.837 --> 16:06.837
you are in joy and your attention
is enlightened.

16:08.188 --> 16:15.456
With all this that you have, what are we
to do now?

16:17.356 --> 16:21.398
If you enlighten the light, it
automatically knows

16:21.599 --> 16:25.669
that it has to give the light.

16:27.861 --> 16:33.159
In the same way, all the Sahaj Yogis
have to take the responsibility

16:33.360 --> 16:38.784
for this great war we have started.

16:38.985 --> 16:50.041
It’s not the war with swords or with
atomic energies,

16:50.366 --> 16:54.701
because they are all destructive.

16:54.858 --> 16:59.510
This is the war against all the destructive
powers

16:59.711 --> 17:03.792
through the power of love which is
constructive,

17:03.993 --> 17:08.343
which constructs human beings, which
constructs societies,

17:08.544 --> 17:14.723
which constructs countries and the whole
world.

17:18.191 --> 17:22.907
That is your own

17:24.486 --> 17:29.643
and also this decision has to be your own.

17:29.844 --> 17:34.086
Even if I give big lectures and say things,

17:34.287 --> 17:38.394
it may not have any effect whatsoever
on you.

17:38.595 --> 17:41.228
It might be just wasted,

17:41.429 --> 17:47.951
if you haven’t got the capacity to imbibe
what I am saying,

17:48.152 --> 17:55.470
so important, so imminent.

17:55.685 --> 17:58.016
Now give up all the worries you have about

17:58.217 --> 18:01.365
your small, small, little, little things
of your family,

18:01.566 --> 18:04.739
of your work, your factories,

18:04.940 --> 18:11.141
of your business, of your official
positions

18:11.342 --> 18:18.755
and just know that everything has to go
through Sahaj Yoga.

18:19.971 --> 18:26.673
Even the cooking I do, I do it through
Sahaj.

18:26.874 --> 18:32.146
If the fire is not working, just put your
hands to the fire, it becomes all right.

18:32.347 --> 18:38.255
If the rice is not cooking, put your hands
to the rice, it cooks.

18:38.456 --> 18:43.110
Anything going wrong anywhere, you can
use your vibrations.

18:43.311 --> 18:51.050
But I don’t know what to use to make you
feel responsible for Sahaj Yoga,

18:51.251 --> 18:55.338
that now we’ve got such a great thing
with us

18:55.539 --> 18:59.414
and what are we going to do about it.

18:59.628 --> 19:03.164
[Shri Mataji continues talk in Marathi
for eleven minutes.]

19:03.365 --> 19:05.409
I’m getting vibrations from you,

19:05.610 --> 19:08.267
that means you all have agreed to what
I’m saying.

19:08.468 --> 19:10.371
May God bless you all.
