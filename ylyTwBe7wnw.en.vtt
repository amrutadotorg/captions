00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:12.722
Today we all Sahaja Yogis are standing
on the brink of the ocean,

00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:18.284
ocean of humanity,

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:28.763
where we have to face the problems
of human beings.

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:35.103
Otherwise, in the nature there are no
problems, they are all already solved.

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:40.858
So one has to understand that

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:51.776
it’s not just a movement of few people,
chosen people,

00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:57.329
just to achieve Self-realisation,

00:00:57.529 --> 00:01:02.899
but it’s a big revolution

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:10.388
which has to bring forth the beauties
of human beings,

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:19.580
the glories of human beings, the proof
of divinity,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.137
of divine power and of God Almighty.

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:31.722
We have to now face that multitude
of people

00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:36.108
who are absolutely ignorant compared
to you,

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:39.976
who have not known the knowledge of God,

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:49.728
who are either lost into the darkness
of ignorance

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.745
or are burning in the fire of ego.

00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:05.506
We have to transform this world into
a new world,

00:02:05.707 --> 00:02:13.681
a beautiful world which you all are
enjoying,

00:02:13.893 --> 00:02:21.657
to establish it, to be established on this
earth,

00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:25.792
for which we have to prepare ourselves.

00:02:25.993 --> 00:02:29.617
So far Sahaj Yoga means blessings;

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:35.113
if somebody is less blessed they ask Me
questions, “How is it, Mother,

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:38.461
we haven’t got this when we are praying
to You?

00:02:38.662 --> 00:02:40.842
Why did it not work out?

00:02:41.043 --> 00:02:44.768
It should have happened, after all we
are worshipping You,

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:50.970
so how is it that my son did not get
the job?”

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:57.405
So, I mean, as if it’s sort of a, some
debts have to be paid

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:01.180
to all the Sahaja Yogis by Sahaj Yoga.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:08.125
That sort of an attitude has been, so far,
towards Sahaj Yog.

00:03:08.737 --> 00:03:13.512
Of, not all of you, I must say,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.067
but in the minds there’s lurking always,
a desire to know

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:28.054
why, when we are Sahaj Yogis, why should
it happen to us.

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:32.227
You’ve seen that God has blessed you.

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:38.414
Some people had very miserable married
life,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.765
they couldn’t understand why they had
to have a miserable married life.

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:48.650
Some had some misfortunes

00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:55.416
and some had some diseases also after
coming to Sahaj Yoga.

00:03:55.573 --> 00:04:00.821
So there has to be understanding that
Sahaj Yoga is

00:04:01.022 --> 00:04:08.376
for correcting your life, for putting you
on solid basis,

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:13.961
on proper foundations to make you
great people.

00:04:14.162 --> 00:04:19.153
As if it gets you immuned to all these
mishappenings,

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:24.626
with blessings of course, so you don’t feel
the effects

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.556
of those misfortunes so much as you would
normally feel.

00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:36.820
This creates beautiful human beings out
of you.

00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:40.944
Some people have hankering after money;

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:45.108
some people think they can make money
by coming to Sahaj Yoga;

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:51.135
some people think they will become leaders
or some think they will have fame,

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:58.658
some think that they will achieve a kind
of a very dominant position;

00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:03.364
and some think that they can befool Me
also.

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:11.957
It’s high time we realise that Sahaj Yoga
is not for this.

00:05:12.158 --> 00:05:15.940
Sahaj Yoga is for making you the wisest
person,

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:23.437
the sanest person, the most generous and
the most confident person in the world,

00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:26.448
because you have to fight,

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:30.966
you have to fight the dark ignorance
of Kali Yuga,

00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:38.600
of ages which is precipitated and today
we see all the bad effects of it.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.919
Whatever you may call it, you may call it
the fanaticism,

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.537
you may call it the atheism, any isms
of any kinds,

00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:56.296
and all these human projections which
have created

00:05:56.497 --> 00:06:00.535
all those artificial webs have to be
broken.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:09.091
But human beings, on the whole, believe
that these artificial webs are real.

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.921
So to break that,

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:16.976
you have to be also be careful that you
don’t break the human beings.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:20.338
While you are breaking their false faiths,

00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:26.456
you have to remember that those people
who are carrying those false faiths

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:32.115
are the ones who have to achieve
Self-realisation.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:38.334
It’s a very delicate work, it’s a very hard
work, it’s a very harsh work

00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:42.820
but it is the most detached work.

00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:47.269
And when we realise that we are
so important,

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.792
that God has blessed us with this peace,

00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:57.745
with this understanding, with these
powers -

00:06:57.945 --> 00:07:01.905
it’s not only for our own gain,

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:08.695
because God is not only for you, He is
for the whole world.

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:12.077
So we have to utilise them, we have
to spread them,

00:07:12.278 --> 00:07:17.577
work it out at every level; we have
to become dynamic about it.

00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:20.130
But the most important thing is
the responsibility

00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:24.212
of Sahaj Yoga we have to take.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.089
We are Sahaj Yogis and we are responsible
for Sahaj Yoga.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.158
What have we done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:07:33.358 --> 00:07:36.461
We looked after our family, our children,
our jobs,

00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:43.549
our this, our that, motorcars, our horses,
our dogs, our cats.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.658
But who is responsible for Sahaj Yoga?

00:07:50.495 --> 00:07:53.647
When it comes to that point, we are
responsible

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:58.949
of Sahaj Yoga, then it works out.

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:06.670
But there is a deliberate action also
of the negative forces.

00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:12.413
And this negativity is acting through
ignorant people who believe,

00:08:12.613 --> 00:08:15.190
who believe that they are right.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.644
They don’t know what is waiting for their
destruction there.

00:08:19.844 --> 00:08:26.311
Specially among our young people
you’ll find

00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:32.861
they just join any party, join any club,

00:08:33.062 --> 00:08:37.079
join any methods, any trend, anything,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:47.060
just because they have no understanding
as to what they have to be.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:51.764
They have to be the Spirit.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:56.872
I asked the other day a president of
a young organisation,

00:08:57.072 --> 00:09:01.013
“What is your policy?” He said,
“We have no policy.”

00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:04.690
They started looking here and there, [and]
said, “We have no policy.”

00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:09.407
I was amazed that they have no policy.

00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:13.875
“No, whatever our leaders say, we do it.”

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:18.824
So to get people out of this kind
of slavery

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:24.227
that they have no brains of their own,
they can’t use their own understanding,

00:09:24.427 --> 00:09:28.566
they have to become the Spirit.

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:34.555
Shivaji who was a great Atma Sakshatkari,
a realised soul,

00:09:34.756 --> 00:09:37.173
for the future he has given the message.

00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:46.653
He said, “Svadharma jagwawa,” means
enlighten your dharma of Spirit.

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:53.758
“Svadharma,” the Spirit has to be
enlightened.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.685
Everybody has said that. I’m specially
quoting him

00:09:58.885 --> 00:10:04.538
because he comes from Maharashtra; apart
from that he was a political head.

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:09.223
Though he was a political head but because
he was a realised soul,

00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:14.423
he said that your Spirit should be
awakened.

00:10:14.623 --> 00:10:18.489
He didn’t talk of all other nonsensical
things.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.604
And he knew that unless and until
the Spirit is awakened,

00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:27.609
people will be doing all kinds of wrong
things.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.084
And that is why today we find all over
the world

00:10:31.284 --> 00:10:33.922
the mess in which all political parties,

00:10:34.122 --> 00:10:40.944
all economic endeavours, all military
endeavours have fallen into.

00:10:41.523 --> 00:10:50.131
So, it is for us to take over and to show
them what is an integrated life,

00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:57.372
and what is the strength of a human being.

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:01.297
Because this Shakti is within everyone.

00:11:01.497 --> 00:11:06.131
Just praying to Shakti, just talking about
Shakti, it doesn’t act.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:15.409
But this divine Shakti has to act, and
act through you people.

00:11:16.282 --> 00:11:19.026
Just try to realise

00:11:19.227 --> 00:11:26.342
that within these few years how much
knowledge you have got,

00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:32.736
how much you know, how deeply you know.

00:11:32.937 --> 00:11:35.765
You are not just passing slogans
or talking, you know -

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:40.480
but you know it, you know
what it is.

00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:44.168
I don’t think I have attended to each
one of you individually,

00:11:44.369 --> 00:11:47.323
but through your Spirit only you have
come to know

00:11:47.524 --> 00:11:51.048
all the knowledge about yourself and
knowledge about others.

00:11:51.249 --> 00:11:56.275
You didn’t have to go to any library, you
didn’t have to go to any university.

00:11:56.476 --> 00:11:58.560
All the saints never went,

00:11:58.761 --> 00:12:02.783
none of the saints went to any university
or read any books,

00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:07.364
but how knowledgeable they were, because
they were the Spirit.

00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:11.716
So the first and foremost responsibility
of a Sahaj Yogi

00:12:11.917 --> 00:12:17.165
on this day is to be the Spirit, on the day
when we are celebrating

00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:22.473
the birthday of Christ, who was the Spirit.

00:12:23.935 --> 00:12:27.635
So, this is our greatest responsibility
first to see that,

00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:35.517
“Are we the Spirit, or we are this body,
this mind, this ego? What are we?”

00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:40.927
If you have achieved that state,

00:12:41.689 --> 00:12:45.795
if you have achieved that state,

00:12:45.996 --> 00:12:49.511
then you are, as they call in Marathi,
samarthya,

00:12:49.712 --> 00:12:59.757
means, you are equal to your name;
that you are the Spirit.

00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:04.138
If you cannot achieve that,

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:08.045
then you are a half-baked Sahaj Yogi,
not yet done.

00:13:08.252 --> 00:13:13.111
As you know, we have no organisations,
no memberships, nothing.

00:13:13.312 --> 00:13:21.917
But we have one thing, that we know
we are realised souls,

00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:29.540
that we know more than all others know,
and that we are not proud of it.

00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:33.273
We are very humble people.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:40.309
But this humility should not become
a stagnation or a lethargy within us that,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:47.943
“Now we are realised souls, let us sit
on a tree and have our blessings.”

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:53.656
You have to get to the roots

00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:57.802
and you all have to work it out
on your level.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:01.507
But first get rid of your own personal
problems,

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:05.763
all petty things that you have.

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:09.713
When we talk of sacrifice, as you know,

00:14:09.914 --> 00:14:15.552
in Sahaj Yoga I have not known what
sacrifice people have done.

00:14:15.753 --> 00:14:19.947
You have to sacrifice your ego,

00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:24.582
which is a headache to you and to Me.

00:14:24.782 --> 00:14:27.289
And you have to sacrifice your
conditioning,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.546
only two things, left and right.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.478
And that can be achieved and many
have achieved [it],

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:44.954
but now put that detached personality
to a test.

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:50.645
And then, once you are sure that you
are detached,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.773
then employ your energy in doing

00:14:55.974 --> 00:15:05.837
constructive improvement of this whole
world.

00:15:06.186 --> 00:15:11.293
It will work out for poverty, it will
work out for politics,

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:20.461
it will work out for economics, it will
work out for every field of life.

00:15:21.312 --> 00:15:27.268
Sahaj Yoga is the only solution because
in this human beings are transformed.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:34.638
It’s not like this, that one person changes
the address

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:40.865
or the badge that he is wearing, and he
becomes something else.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:46.560
Or from church to temple and temple
to church.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:52.631
It’s something within that transforms you,
makes you knowledgeable.

00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:58.636
So you are already Sat Chit Ananda; because
you know the truth,

00:15:58.837 --> 00:16:06.837
you are in joy and your attention
is enlightened.

00:16:08.188 --> 00:16:15.456
With all this that you have, what are we
to do now?

00:16:17.356 --> 00:16:21.398
If you enlighten the light, it
automatically knows

00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:25.669
that it has to give the light.

00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:33.159
In the same way, all the Sahaj Yogis
have to take the responsibility

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.784
for this great war we have started.

00:16:38.985 --> 00:16:50.041
It’s not the war with swords or with
atomic energies,

00:16:50.366 --> 00:16:54.701
because they are all destructive.

00:16:54.858 --> 00:16:59.510
This is the war against all the destructive
powers

00:16:59.711 --> 00:17:03.792
through the power of love which is
constructive,

00:17:03.993 --> 00:17:08.343
which constructs human beings, which
constructs societies,

00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:14.723
which constructs countries and the whole
world.

00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:22.907
That is your own

00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:29.643
and also this decision has to be your own.

00:17:29.844 --> 00:17:34.086
Even if I give big lectures and say things,

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:38.394
it may not have any effect whatsoever
on you.

00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:41.228
It might be just wasted,

00:17:41.429 --> 00:17:47.951
if you haven’t got the capacity to imbibe
what I am saying,

00:17:48.152 --> 00:17:55.470
so important, so imminent.

00:17:55.685 --> 00:17:58.016
Now give up all the worries you have about

00:17:58.217 --> 00:18:01.365
your small, small, little, little things
of your family,

00:18:01.566 --> 00:18:04.739
of your work, your factories,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:11.141
of your business, of your official
positions

00:18:11.342 --> 00:18:18.755
and just know that everything has to go
through Sahaj Yoga.

00:18:19.971 --> 00:18:26.673
Even the cooking I do, I do it through
Sahaj.

00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:32.146
If the fire is not working, just put your
hands to the fire, it becomes all right.

00:18:32.347 --> 00:18:38.255
If the rice is not cooking, put your hands
to the rice, it cooks.

00:18:38.456 --> 00:18:43.110
Anything going wrong anywhere, you can
use your vibrations.

00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:51.050
But I don’t know what to use to make you
feel responsible for Sahaj Yoga,

00:18:51.251 --> 00:18:55.338
that now we’ve got such a great thing
with us

00:18:55.539 --> 00:18:59.414
and what are we going to do about it.

00:18:59.628 --> 00:19:03.164
[Shri Mataji continues talk in Marathi
for eleven minutes.]

00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:05.409
I’m getting vibrations from you,

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.267
that means you all have agreed to what
I’m saying.

00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:10.371
May God bless you all.
