AI GENERATED. on our level so it would be very easy for Greg.

1
00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:09.989
And

2
00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:12.479
nobody put a question.

3
00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:13.659
It means that they were so,

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.720
and I really forget it.

5
00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:13.979
That's because finally tell me

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.180
because what was going on outside the territory.

7
00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:25.069
It's a little work.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.649
That

9
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.530
Yeah she did.

10
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:46.020
With reddish hair,

11
00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.090
she went out and came back.

12
00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.150
I saw her coming back.

13
00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:46.349
She must be annoyed because I think she must have blasted.

14
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.529
She was annoyed when she got out she was very annoyed.

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.610
She was a.

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.750
And during your whole speech vibrations were so fresh,

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.770
so fresh,

18
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.009
all the.

19
00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.919
Yeah,

20
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.299
really.

21
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.400
But just for now.

22
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.720
That's very good.

23
00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:23.879
They come back and they're really tiny.

24
00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.160
3

25
00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.489
Istra also.

26
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.169
Is a lot.

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.410
Uh,

28
00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:33.589
but we did it.

29
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.500
Mother,

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.279
they all,

31
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.650
I,

32
00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:44.800
because I was

33
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.489
on the,

34
00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:46.180
on the stage,

35
00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:47.809
I could see the faces

36
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.680
and they were what amazed me mother that

37
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.010
I said.

38
00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:53.849
could see

39
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.120
In such a crowd.

40
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.510
The amount of people who were so respectful and and eager to receive something.

41
00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.150
I was just amazed.

42
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.900
Is this lap for your lectures.

43
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.970
I did not clap.

44
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.940
I as I talk to the people in the car,

45
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.630
I was really touched because I mean my

46
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.839
my German is not.

47
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.580
For the young man to speak that like

48
00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:29.070
because it was the video,

49
00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.419
the introduction.

50
00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.539
I didn't,

51
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.639
I didn't have any room.

52
00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.039
No one never clapped you in many things when they were into that.

53
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.839
This is the first time I was very happy,

54
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.110
so I also clapped,

55
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.720
so I.

56
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.440
now one thing I want to tell you

57
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.080
that when haemoglobin react or do anything wrong,

58
00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.949
it really bodily harm was,

59
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.960
I believe.

60
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.330
It still touch my,

61
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.009
but if anybody else does anything that can help.

62
00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:15.309
But you be sure because you're part and parcel of everything you do anything

63
00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:16.740
that helps.

64
00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:17.550
You know,

65
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.639
so now remember for all of you that don't try to put any negative things

66
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.179
before me.

67
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.100
If you have,

68
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.910
you go plan for yourself,

69
00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.399
come back,

70
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.649
but don't send me any negative thought anymore,

71
00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:31.559
all right?

72
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:32.960
If you have a problem,

73
00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:35.440
you try to raise your hand,

74
00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.699
all right,

75
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.960
never.

76
00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.279
Negative thing with you talk too much.

77
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.720
And nothing negative.

78
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:48.660
I felt it.

79
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.729
I do it all right,

80
00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:50.250
but.

81
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.929
It doubles.

82
00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.690
Mhm

83
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.500
Because you are fighting fast,

84
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.830
if my eyes start spinning,

85
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.470
will that be?

86
00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.929
You are my eyes.

87
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.410
You are my heart,

88
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.169
you are my.

89
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.130
What about that.

90
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.839
Yeah.

91
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
Yeah

92
00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:24.640
I can.

93
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.269
I just

94
00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:33.140
The further is not for me but I was placed in my body

95
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.309
in my.

96
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.130
Wow.

97
00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:43.690
Like this movement is makes against the rhythm of my body.

98
00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.859
It

99
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.179
You should know.

100
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.230
You think a lot of.

101
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.279
Let's take a while,

102
00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.440
I don't think that.

103
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.269
To decide to do it yesterday.

104
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.540
That there is no action of ours.

105
00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:13.619
Mhm.

106
00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:16.119
Not

107
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.739
some

108
00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.149
some for that.

109
00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:28.269
for others who will not be communication.

110
00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:31.559
Oh.

111
00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.250
273.

112
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.519
Oh

113
00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.100
really.

114
00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.540
Uh,

115
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.049
Yeah.

116
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.470
No this is the one so let's have some sample right.

117
00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:37.549
To the heavens of the

118
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.450
We and our people

119
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.160
and with the help of us.

120
00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:44.339
Well,

121
00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:44.779
yeah.

122
00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.600
Yeah.

123
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.649
Yeah

124
00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:52.109
Do

125
00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:54.690
Look.

126
00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.850
What's

127
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.630
But the flower water.

128
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.519
There was no water in the flower.

129
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.589
This is a real stuff

130
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:10.820
that is so much.

131
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.910
And that was from

132
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.869
the popular.

133
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.470
I'm just like.

134
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.850
I think really that far as all

135
00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:28.920
the way this.

136
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.730
programme in general took place has proven

137
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:35.929
that

138
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.429
you have now

139
00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:40.040
started surgery around another dimension

140
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.850
that we just move a little finger and everything moves up.

141
00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:44.559
But you want basically.

142
00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:49.049
And I'm going,

143
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.540
you also go with me.

144
00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:55.470
I'm writing.

145
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.989
I'm not saying all that.

146
00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:58.429
So,

147
00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.549
don't talk of small things,

148
00:07:58.579 --> 00:07:58.890
top of this.

149
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.420
Just don't talk.

150
00:07:59.429 --> 00:07:59.679
Don't think of something.

151
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:06.500
First

152
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.149
Yeah.

153
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.350
What a dilation.

154
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:25.750
In one shot so many for the first time they came and they got the.

155
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.549
It is just hard yellow,

156
00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:29.450
it was fantastic.

157
00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:34.950
But I didn't agree,

158
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.479
but the way it has happened here not happened.

159
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.729
That that generally also.

160
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:44.359
I

161
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:46.010
They were,

162
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.690
they said,

163
00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:48.080
I feel it's all over

164
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.210
to journalists.

165
00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:51.460
Who was here today.

166
00:08:51.789 --> 00:08:52.270
She was.

167
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.299
She was here this evening.

168
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:54.909
She said,

169
00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:55.190
I said,

170
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.789
did you feel?

171
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.390
She said,

172
00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:56.849
Oh yes,

173
00:08:56.909 --> 00:08:57.580
all over.

174
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.510
The photographer didn't think about that.

175
00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:00.820
Yes,

176
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.390
she did.

177
00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:01.630
She,

178
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:02.469
she did.

179
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.630
She did.

180
00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:04.539
She didn't.

181
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.760
Very much.

182
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.619
I asked the the journalists.

183
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.210
And journalist said that she has,

184
00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:16.669
but the photographer didn't because she,

185
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:30.349
she was,

186
00:09:30.359 --> 00:09:30.369
uh,

187
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:30.530
she had her attention and this is what she told me she got it here,

188
00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:30.580
but not the problem.

189
00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:30.650
This is what she said.

190
00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:30.739
I'm I asked both of them,

191
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.799
both of them told me.

192
00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:34.200
So she.

193
00:09:51.539 --> 00:09:53.859
It was the way I spoke to at the class also.

194
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.659

Um,

it's a red.

204
00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:27.059
I know

205
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.580
I know I saw that.

206
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.510
Um

207
00:10:35.849 --> 00:10:35.859
This.

208
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.710
Yes.

209
00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:54.419
No.

210
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:55.979
Uh

211
00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:01.270
I

On people.

213
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:09.460
OK.

214
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:17.200
All the men who have

215
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.619
this is the one you know where you know the

216
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.929
the first we had been breed in this castle.

217
00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:36.580
You remember

218
00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:40.960
For these times so far,

219
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:41.630
yes.

220
00:11:46.419 --> 00:11:46.770
Let me see.

221
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.219
I mean the same problem.

222
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:53.080
You

223
00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.489
Don't you for that.

224
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.349
I said you see that one.

225
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.250
Then I was.

226
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:10.460
Going down the.

227
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.299
Mark

228
00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:14.799
In which that I remember.

229
00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:22.440
When we went to that big house.

230
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.130
For the first seminar we

231
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.109
we had the.

232
00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:36.130
Well they

233
00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:38.000
they was that is why this boy

234
00:12:40.669 --> 00:12:40.700
you still like.

235
00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:45.049
David.

236
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.260
Oh yeah.

237
00:12:52.349 --> 00:12:52.380
The

238
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.919
1978.

239
00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:03.369
I know of a guy.

240
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.229
and uh

241
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.400
Somebody should not stop explaining something.

242
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.609
I know.

243
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.750
One eye wouldn't shadowed,

244
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.219
but.

245
00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:36.489
The

246
00:13:37.229 --> 00:13:38.619
the loops and the

247
00:13:40.909 --> 00:13:40.940
situation of the.

248
00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:46.989
Just.

249
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.210
No.

250
00:13:57.919 --> 00:13:58.159
You are.

251
00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:00.450
Yes.

252
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.159
Mhm

253
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.260
The background just.

254
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:22.429
I've seen it just got out whether it's a thing or not,

255
00:14:47.659 --> 00:14:47.729
I've seen one where we,

256
00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:47.869
I think in your house you've never had a coloured

257
00:14:47.869 --> 00:14:47.989
thing but one of your photographers got the colour.

258
00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:52.130
So I want to ask question,

259
00:14:52.669 --> 00:14:53.460
do you have any anything behind?

260
00:14:53.469 --> 00:14:56.299
It's white.

261
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.369
Oh,

262
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.799
my favourite is right that I was writing my myself.

263
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:10.390
How this background.

264
00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:13.500
It's so good.

265
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:13.890
I mean,

266
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.650
the solicity of it right now is so great,

267
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.010
isn't it?

268
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.429
And you can't get how you look this colour.

269
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.140
I don't think the ball had any such colour like that.

270
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:30.780
So

271
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.090
Well in fact I did well was yellowish.

272
00:15:37.219 --> 00:15:38.700
the photographs and yellowish.

273
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.280
That's why.

274
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.869
So all that is and just check this colour.

275
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.580
So I called before.

276
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.289
The extraordinary thing is that there's dark and

277
00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:50.429
lightning in such a way it emphasises the

278
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.489
because you get life from both sides,

279
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:13.520
you see,

280
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:13.659
and that has come out from the point of view of an art.

281
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.429
All things

282
00:16:17.479 --> 00:16:17.500
So

283
00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:24.049
So just when I looking less straight.

284
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.400
That is the corner of this side,

285
00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.419
all of my people.

286
00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:32.539
In the corner of my eye.

287
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.200
On your respective posts on that.

288
00:16:42.729 --> 00:16:43.219
No

289
00:16:44.859 --> 00:16:45.750
Let's see the part.

290
00:16:46.489 --> 00:16:47.250
That's right.

291
00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:49.429
The bluish blue white blue.

292
00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:54.760
First.

293
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.020
You

294
00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:00.799
Mo

295
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.359
It's for children,

296
00:17:03.619 --> 00:17:03.960
it's,

297
00:17:04.098 --> 00:17:04.969
it's for good.

298
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.949
Yeah,

299
00:17:12.108 --> 00:17:13.160
you learn the 5.

300
00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:28.358
You know.

301
00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:38.859
to the people.

302
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.540
I thought these people to come at 10 o'clock.

303
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:45.839
So the car

304
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.630
Wow

305
00:17:49.489 --> 00:17:49.949
Yeah

306
00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:54.319
the button.

307
00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:00.489
I don't I.

308
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:02.670
Uh,

309
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.719

310
00:18:04.729 --> 00:18:05.390
the,

311
00:18:05.989 --> 00:18:08.239
the metal luggage I have?

312
00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:14.109
Yes,

313
00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:14.160
you would like to.

314
00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:25.979
but you couldn't find too much?

315
00:18:27.479 --> 00:18:28.810
And the way you get a feel.

316
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:32.500
We

317
00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:34.719
I you.

318
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.920
I like to,

319
00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:42.510
I love it because you see it's so problem.

320
00:18:45.729 --> 00:18:46.270
Uh,

321
00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:48.640
you are the things that you are in the correct.

322
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.760
The the.

323
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.310
Yeah

324
00:18:57.949 --> 00:18:57.979
How do we?

325
00:18:57.989 --> 00:18:58.089
We don't have to we are crossing,

326
00:18:58.099 --> 00:18:58.209
but we are going through tunnels.

327
00:18:58.219 --> 00:18:58.310
We go through tunnels

328
00:19:17.729 --> 00:19:17.859
through tunnels tunnels,

329
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.699
but we will not see anything because we are

330
00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:21.819
taking the train at 9 o'clock in the evening,

331
00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:23.339
so we will be looking it over.

332
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.670
Maybe tomorrow morning we will see some,

333
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.020
but not very uh in Zurich and then after tomorrow morning

334
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.180
in Zurich and then by noon on Saturday in Geneva.

335
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.920
Oh,

336
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.520
that,

337
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:42.859
that's very good.

338
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.760
That's excellent.

339
00:19:46.329 --> 00:19:46.630
That they.

340
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.310
That sounds really

341
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.150
that

342
00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:58.339
we have and uh.

343
00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:59.369
Uh-huh,

344
00:19:59.439 --> 00:20:00.589
that's sound good.

345
00:20:01.689 --> 00:20:01.699
That

346
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.170
it's not.

347
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:13.280
You should you should see the you can't.

348
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:13.900
Right.

349
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:19.050
No,

350
00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:21.089
57 or something like that.

351
00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:26.689
The training of

352
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.989
Yeah just the you know on which IV.

353
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.479
Uh,

354
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.959
for putting them in the for transplant.

355
00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:35.849
This

356
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:37.920
goes to that.

357
00:20:42.979 --> 00:20:43.930
we ask you for.

358
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.560
I

359
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:47.900
So

360
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.880
Ezor is going to come

361
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.109
to Geneva,

362
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:51.150
Anzor,

363
00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:53.829
and then.

364
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:54.880
Uh,

365
00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:57.089
Guido is going to come to Geneva.

366
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.530
They would like to get a job there for at least 1 month or 6 weeks.

367
00:21:03.619 --> 00:21:06.989
When we ask people for that because it's very difficult to get a job.

368
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:11.949
Oh

369
00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:15.520
So that.

370
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.050
When you learn to

371
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.140
So many problems just.

372
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:31.869
I

373
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.569
see the way English people also use people just to get my dad

374
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:39.989
I don't see the girl.

375
00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:42.859
You

376
00:21:44.719 --> 00:21:45.579
Besides I have not.

377
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:48.510
So

378
00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:53.489
the literal rather than telling you that you have people.

379
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:54.660
So

380
00:21:55.859 --> 00:21:56.589
What did you feel?

381
00:21:57.939 --> 00:21:59.099
I also said to them,

382
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.310
talking to them that they don't trust now.

383
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.030
And the only people who have jobs now,

384
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.140
higher salaries.

385
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.959
So your bones dropped so much.

386
00:22:12.699 --> 00:22:12.949
That's

387
00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:17.760
Mother will be.

388
00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:20.540
So would you like me to go take the picture?

389
00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:22.540
to

390
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.859
Yes,

391
00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:25.900
a new one.

392
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:36.180
Mhm.

393
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.130
Hello

394
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.310
May I ask you,

395
00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:51.670
Pedro is of Cuban nationality,

396
00:22:52.239 --> 00:22:55.550
and every time he wants to go out of Italy,

397
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.979
which we saw that happens quite often.

398
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:03.780
I just started to.

399
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:14.229
is Cuban and every time he wants to go out of Italy

400
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:17.900
for now,

401
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.020
they don't want

402
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:23.010
to give him the visa to go back to Italy

403
00:23:23.349 --> 00:23:30.819
though he's there for 8 years and he would like to apply for Italian nationality,

404
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.069
but the Cuban government would not give him.

405
00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:36.650
Papers necessary

406
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.329
because he's a kind of refugee so maybe if you

407
00:23:41.369 --> 00:23:41.880
give a ban.

408
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.310
It could have nationalistic.

409
00:23:46.089 --> 00:23:47.819
But the TVs always have a,

410
00:23:47.829 --> 00:23:50.489
a bra like all these people are thinking,

411
00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.140
you know,

412
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.449
what we have this from TV.

413
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.949
But he's not a real refugee in the sense that he still has the Cuban passport.

414
00:24:00.849 --> 00:24:00.859
Yeah.

415
00:24:07.229 --> 00:24:07.250
Did you?

416
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.189
And ask of you.

417
00:24:17.439 --> 00:24:17.479
political and they do.

418
00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:26.699
No,

419
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.349
he would not receive it because he stayed too long in Italy.

420
00:24:32.439 --> 00:24:32.589
Well,

421
00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:33.050
you,

422
00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:34.469
you can't say that.

423
00:24:34.719 --> 00:24:36.189
I don't want to want to see what.

424
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.069
What is it?

425
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:04.829
It's the one,

426
00:25:05.849 --> 00:25:06.079
this is not that big and it is this is dangerous it is dangerous one.

427
00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:06.630
What is it called that

428
00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:15.900
is the same.

429
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:16.569
Uh.

430
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.300
It's dangerous I know.

431
00:25:23.369 --> 00:25:25.079
The dangerous animal

432
00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:31.650
is still there.

433
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:31.680
How do?

434
00:25:31.689 --> 00:25:33.410
Are you sure this is how she looks?

435
00:25:36.589 --> 00:25:37.439
Are you sure.

436
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:41.949
It is a wasp.

437
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.689
It's bigger,

438
00:25:45.219 --> 00:25:45.540
bigger.

439
00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:46.939
It was big like that.

440
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.040
So what do you do?

441
00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:59.400
So is the family.

442
00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:01.219
Yeah

443
00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:09.430
Mhm

444
00:26:11.329 --> 00:26:11.630
How,

445
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.920
what are you doing there,

446
00:26:12.989 --> 00:26:13.000
um.

447
00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:15.869
I see that

448
00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:21.189
that thing goes out there behind that.

449
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:21.979
keep the door opens up there

450
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.930
and take that one.

451
00:26:37.369 --> 00:26:37.489
I can see from this side if you open the door,

452
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:37.540
open the door.

453
00:27:04.729 --> 00:27:05.729
I can see no door can be open here.

454
00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:06.359
The door can't be opened up.

455
00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:11.810
It doesn't matter,

456
00:27:11.819 --> 00:27:11.859
the doors

457
00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:26.260
just hit it from outside,

458
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:26.719
but you have to listen to me.

459
00:27:26.729 --> 00:27:28.969
You have to hit just the outside of the face.

460
00:27:37.199 --> 00:27:38.119
I open the window.

461
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:40.530
OK.

462
00:27:46.589 --> 00:27:47.469
Be careful.

463
00:27:58.890 --> 00:27:58.900
No,

464
00:27:58.910 --> 00:27:59.349
no I can

465
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:00.949
I can see there it is there.

466
00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:01.040
I can see it's still there.

467
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.020
So the second school.

468
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.359
All right,

469
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.849
if it is not a thing leave it go.

470
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:08.189
You better kill it.

471
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:15.859
I see I see I see now

472
00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:23.270
it between the two,

473
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:23.290
yes.

474
00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:24.369
That

475
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.030
Just feel

476
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.810
fast,

477
00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:29.089
take it hard,

478
00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:30.150
uh,

479
00:28:30.219 --> 00:28:30.640
that's all.

480
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.469
Yeah.

481
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.750
Careful,

482
00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:37.839
but he's dead,

483
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.400
he's dead,

484
00:28:38.689 --> 00:28:40.229
he's dead.

485
00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:45.880
No.

486
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.050
will be remembered in posterity for being the man who

487
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.599
killed the hornet with the one that can be deadly.

488
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:25.449
3 or 4 the figure could be the but it's the

489
00:29:25.449 --> 00:29:25.650
same thing the same thing you know this is different.

490
00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:30.579
explain.

491
00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:33.890
You have all these things.

492
00:29:37.469 --> 00:29:37.880
You know,

493
00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:42.329
I have already seen sitting in on the balcony.

494
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.349
A few

495
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:48.489
Now,

496
00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:50.530
why don't you do something about.

497
00:29:52.369 --> 00:29:52.420
OK

498
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:53.530
I

499
00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:54.199
don't think

500
00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:59.140
they are in the trees in the trees.

501
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.270
I think

502
00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.109
because they are not there must be some sort of a

503
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:07.300
you must inform.

504
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:09.319
that

505
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:12.530
We do the

506
00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:13.890
the that.

507
00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:22.349
Must you of it.

508
00:30:23.709 --> 00:30:24.650
It's no.

509
00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:31.849
I

510
00:30:35.739 --> 00:30:35.890
And

511
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.650
when you had the next that the.

512
00:30:39.579 --> 00:30:39.660
We have the firemen

513
00:30:44.099 --> 00:30:45.569
to get to come and to kill them.

514
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:47.520
No,

515
00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:49.989
we have to ask the firemen.

516
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.510
Have you already seen this big thing,

517
00:30:53.199 --> 00:30:59.640
not in the house the windows and do you have a problem like that,

518
00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:01.439
but not this house.

519
00:31:01.959 --> 00:31:04.020
We closed the whole house properly,

520
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:04.670
all right,

521
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.430
and we get out from the house.

522
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:08.680
At that time,

523
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.640
the family will come out later.

524
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.729
And we are free when they say it's all right.

525
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.800
Because the flights go out for me.

526
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:21.770
That that

527
00:31:27.869 --> 00:31:27.880
Mhm.

528
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:31.189
Bean.

529
00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:35.329
Oh

530
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.239
And I see such things now.

531
00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:44.459
I mean,

532
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.670
the first time I see it,

533
00:31:46.709 --> 00:31:47.150
I mean.

534
00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.989
How is in this time?

535
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.199
You only laughs,

536
00:31:57.229 --> 00:31:58.069
but not that.

537
00:31:59.579 --> 00:31:59.900
Well,

538
00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.729
we had a lot a lot to see.

539
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.390
Terrible.

540
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.949
We could not stay on the balcony.

541
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.170
There was a there was an SS on the other side of the house.

542
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:20.439
is also

543
00:32:22.719 --> 00:32:23.000
This place.

544
00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:29.089
Your sense of please and stuff.

545
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.199
You actually you should have restche in the places where

546
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.339
there's less sun.

547
00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:40.160
Who is this?

548
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.260
It's a painting which has been done in Munich.

549
00:32:49.489 --> 00:32:50.560
It's not family.

550
00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:51.219
It's,

551
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.260
it's just a,

552
00:32:52.369 --> 00:32:54.589
a study of a character.

553
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.109
And it is called,

554
00:32:57.439 --> 00:32:58.550
it's a warrior.

555
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.030
It is called before the enemy.

556
00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:05.119
He sees the enemy which is attacking and he takes out his word.

557
00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:19.229
Well

558
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:20.670
Uh,

559
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.040
uh,

560
00:33:21.239 --> 00:33:21.890
Mr.

561
00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:22.479
Mr.

562
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.630
Wolf was the

563
00:33:25.469 --> 00:33:30.880
was in the Pinakotte of Min and I think he was the rector of the

564
00:33:31.339 --> 00:33:33.369
main art gallery in Munich.

565
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:35.420
That's not.

566
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.109
This

567
00:33:38.689 --> 00:33:40.260
Beginning of the century.

568
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:43.560
So

569
00:33:47.479 --> 00:33:50.339
Expression is showing me is thinking about.

570
00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:54.890
Or defending himself.

571
00:33:55.989 --> 00:33:59.260
And the beauty of the whole thing is is very few colours.

572
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.349
When you have a few colours,

573
00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.020
you see,

574
00:34:02.449 --> 00:34:03.390
it's so confusing,

575
00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.469
no complications,

576
00:34:04.719 --> 00:34:08.649
but balancing and all that it's just very few colours you offer.

577
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.050
Sheets of brown and white.

578
00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:17.969
Mhm

579
00:34:18.648 --> 00:34:18.658

the tears for his wife.

628
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:29.070
I started having this because I talked to him at the beginning of the programme,

629
00:40:29.149 --> 00:40:30.500
so something came on to me.

630
00:40:31.489 --> 00:40:31.580

00:40:42.989 --> 00:40:43.419
then.

640
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:48.659
She was directed everybody is in English with

641
00:40:48.969 --> 00:40:49.840
all those who are the same.

642
00:40:51.739 --> 00:40:52.350
So can also understand.

643
00:40:55.929 --> 00:40:59.040
But he said if you stop counting your blessing,

644
00:40:59.290 --> 00:40:59.600
then,

645
00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:00.199
uh,

646
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.810
and if you worry about trouble then you invite trouble and you will have trouble.

647
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.719
And then she said,

648
00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:07.149

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.330

651
00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:09.879
uh,

652
00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:11.719
wives are giving birth to their children.

653
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.169
What is so great about it?

654
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:13.929
If you can,

655
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:16.919
she can even have birth here and showing the,

656
00:41:16.969 --> 00:41:17.520
the street,

657
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:17.850
and I said,

658
00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:18.350
Oh mother,

659
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.860
please.

660
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:19.479
I mean,

661
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:19.729
you know,

662
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.399
it was really kind of,

663
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:22.560
she was very

664
00:41:22.729 --> 00:41:24.159
unpleased by by

665
00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.270
by this reaction.

666
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.250
I said something I should not have said.

667
00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:29.520
It's a teaching for all of us.

668
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:30.540
What happened?

669
00:41:31.649 --> 00:41:35.689
What happened is I told you that I had no fear that.

670
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.919
Vienna,

671
00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:37.570
right,

672
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.239
so I had no problem.

673
00:41:39.459 --> 00:41:42.510
Why did I tell her in the car this thing that

674
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.689
the only weak spot was this that which was rubbish,

675
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.270
you see.

676
00:41:46.739 --> 00:41:49.489
Now this is just to bring attention something,

677
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:49.629
you know,

678
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.969
it's just bringing something negative to her.

679
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:55.169
That's why she said all what she said here.

680
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.979
Can you say what said here that we had to promise.

681
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:02.639
She says that.

682
00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:04.189
you could be

683
00:42:07.129 --> 00:42:07.409
