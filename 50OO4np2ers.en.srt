1
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:59,694
It is such a great pleasure to see you all
assembled here,

2
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:10,762
and which is such a far-fetched place, away
from the madding crowd.

3
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:19,404
It's such a beautiful place, and which has
vibrations.

4
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:25,281
They can't hear you.

5
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:32,422
Now can you hear Me? All right.

6
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:37,874
It's all right now.

7
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:44,621
I selected this place suddenly

8
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:51,469
from a very thick newspaper, American
newspaper.

9
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,571
The vibrations were just shooting out

10
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:59,299
and I said, "What is this, coming from
where?"

11
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,737
And there was a little advertisement,

12
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:08,289
and I said, "This is the place where we
have to go."

13
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:16,038
This place has so many vibrations, even
in the advertisement."

14
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:22,834
So you can imagine how the guidance comes.

15
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:30,682
It comes from vibrations, and that's how
I was here

16
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:38,428
and this place was selected by the divine
Force,

17
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:42,555
and it happened only in one day.

18
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:47,441
Such a miraculous thing to happen in one
day!

19
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:54,707
It was taking so much time for them even
to get this,

20
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:59,861
and suddenly I told them, "Better get it."

21
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:10,327
It all worked out, and we are now here
in the most beautiful atmosphere.

22
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:20,400
Of course, you know that Red Indians were
driven out

23
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:29,189
and they came here to hide themselves. They
were hiding themselves in this place

24
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:38,802
so that they should not be crushed and
destroyed forever.

25
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:46,634
That era is over now, that era
of domination,

26
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:52,917
of entering into somebody else's land and
occupying it,

27
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:57,272
and considering it to be a great revelry,

28
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:04,017
all that is over now, the human
understanding has gone much beyond;

29
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:11,078
and they understand that this is sinful,
this is wrong,

30
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:14,643
whatever we have done was wrong.

31
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:18,003
But those people are no more.

32
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:23,689
And the children and the grandchildren
of those children

33
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:29,037
of these people who were the children
of God, they used to think,

34
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:32,686
do not like all that;

35
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:39,795
because you have no right

36
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:47,981
to take somebody's land like that and
occupy it as your own.

37
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:52,255
Of course, the land doesn't belong
to anyone,

38
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:58,903
but still wherever you are born, that's
your land,

39
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:08,052
and that land has to be kept with those
who are born here, who own it.

40
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:14,852
But this kind of aggression has been going
on for ages now.

41
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:19,633
Now the time has come to finish this,

42
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,783
once for all give up this kind
of adventure,

43
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:33,306
is to enter into somebody's land or
somebody's house and occupy it.

44
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:37,077
But there's another kind of aggression
I see now,

45
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:42,627
is that they enter into the minds
of the people now

46
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:52,333
through their talk, through their all kinds
of aggressive attitude,

47
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:57,704
and the mind, mind itself becomes a slave.

48
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:06,166
The present times are like that, I think,
where people have no freedom

49
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:14,083
to think what is right, what is wrong, and
also to take to right things.

50
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:20,555
They have to accept whatever is happening
around,

51
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:27,701
whatever is immoral, whatever is
destructive.

52
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:34,421
One has to accept because still, I think,

53
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:38,622
we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja
yogis

54
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:48,558
who can oppose all these adventures
of modern times.

55
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:52,722
We have another kind where we find

56
00:08:52,922 --> 00:09:01,124
these false gurus who aggress - specially
America.

57
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:08,310
America is really cursed that way because
it had money,

58
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,689
so all the crooks of the world came here -
just imagine.

59
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,347
To have money itself is not a blessing.

60
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:23,167
They all came here and looted rich people

61
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:27,939
and have made so much money for themself.

62
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:34,317
This kind of exploitation

63
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:40,274
is very much dangerous, much more,

64
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:46,016
because the mind gets ruined. I have seen
many people were ruined,

65
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:52,166
specially many seekers were ruined
completely.

66
00:09:53,862 --> 00:10:00,203
I hope they are born again and get their
Self-realization.

67
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:03,458
The seeking is there, no doubt,

68
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:10,148
but all kinds of obstacles have come,
all kinds of temptations are there.

69
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:20,729
And so, despite all that seeking, earnest
seeking, honest seeking,

70
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:27,169
they have fallen into traps, which I cannot
explain

71
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:33,218
why should it have happened, but it has
happened - one has to see.

72
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:40,303
It's a - makes you very miserable, unhappy.

73
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:47,074
But still so many are there, you are there,
saved now.

74
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:54,186
And in this Last Judgment you have risen
from that level

75
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:58,580
to this new level, where I am sure

76
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,342
you will be able to salvage many more.

77
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:11,040
Each person can salvage at least thousand
people, and so many of you,

78
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:17,982
if you try that, it would be of a very,
very great,

79
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:27,028
very great emancipation for this world
which we are all to save.

80
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:36,777
So one must know the first, first duty
of every Sahaja yogi now

81
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:42,874
is to save others, to talk about Sahaja
Yoga,

82
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:51,092
to work out Sahaja Yoga in different
places.

83
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:55,669
For example now, I was surprised that they
are working out

84
00:11:55,869 --> 00:12:03,746
on children who are abused. They are also
in India, we are working out

85
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:09,601
on various places like prisons, armies.

86
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:14,456
So you can enter into all kinds
of activities,

87
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:26,107
you can enter into all kinds of aggressed
places and save people.

88
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:32,615
But worst of all, I think, is the innocence
is under attack

89
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:36,244
in these Western countries, specially
in America.

90
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:44,219
The innocence is under attack and this is
something is very dangerous,

91
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:54,158
because the children get this mutation
at a very young age,

92
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:57,601
and what will happen to them?

93
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:04,447
So we have to think of all those innocent
children,

94
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:10,710
what we can do for them, how we can save
them,

95
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,823
how we can work it out.

96
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:19,491
The concern has to now go from yourself
to others.

97
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:24,825
You got your realization alright; you
corrected yourself,

98
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:32,096
you are absolutely perfecting yourself;
all this is there,

99
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:37,036
but now what is to be done?

100
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:44,583
For what is this light enlightened here?
It is for others.

101
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:51,242
So now Sahaja yogis have to live for others,
and not for themselves.

102
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:55,278
They'll have all the energy, they'll have
all the support

103
00:13:55,455 --> 00:14:00,453
and they'll have all the blessings. So we
have to live for others.

104
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:05,444
And how do we live for others - is very
simple,

105
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:10,842
is to have concern, concern about
everything.

106
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:17,259
You have concern about the Mother
Earth, concern about your neighbors,

107
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:24,688
concern about the people who's suffering
all over the world.

108
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:30,751
If you read the newspaper you will be
amazed how

109
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:36,513
things are happening, how people are
suffering.

110
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:39,675
We have to understand fundamentally

111
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,984
that unless and until transformation takes
place,

112
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:49,708
we cannot change this world. And you all
can transform others,

113
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:55,496
so it's your duty, it's your job
to transform other people

114
00:14:55,697 --> 00:15:01,243
and tell them what is divine love.

115
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:05,764
Love is the only way now we can work out.

116
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:14,588
It is something like a big, big hole which
should go into this darkness of aggression,

117
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:22,527
and which will clarify many places, many
hearts, many people.

118
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:33,626
It is a ocean, we should say, ocean
of greatness.

119
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:39,610
This divine love is so great

120
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:48,001
and so powerful, at the same time so very
gentle

121
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:53,704
that you can see the nature, how, how
the trees grow:

122
00:15:53,904 --> 00:16:03,142
every leaf gets the sunshine, every tree
has its own position.

123
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:06,564
We have to learn so much from the nature,

124
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:12,653
because nature is bound with that love.

125
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:18,505
Nature has no aggressiveness.

126
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:26,057
It is just under the complete control
of the divine love.

127
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:31,861
With this understanding you should also
know

128
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:38,132
that when you are getting to Sahaja yogis

129
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:43,996
what should be your attitude: how you
should move,

130
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:49,610
how you should talk to them, how you should
understand them,

131
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,190
how you should express your love.

132
00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:01,167
This is quite possible now, it's not
difficult.

133
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:06,155
You should not be afraid, not feel shy.

134
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:15,046
But in a sweet manner you can talk to them,

135
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:21,182
you can communicate with them, you can
tell them;

136
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:30,043
because this was the time, this was
to happen,

137
00:17:30,244 --> 00:17:33,921
that's the reason Adi Shakti had to come.

138
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:38,247
Without Her, it would not have been
possible.

139
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:42,914
All other incarnations were there,

140
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:47,553
but firstly, they were only on one chakras,

141
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:51,497
and another one was they had to establish
themselves

142
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:56,095
with other people, with the people around.

143
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:59,464
They did try and they worked it out,

144
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:05,618
but it didn't really work in the real sense
of the word.

145
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:13,404
So Adi Shakti had to come, who has all
of them with Her.

146
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:20,480
They're all with us, all the time wanting
to help you

147
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:29,500
to do everything that you want to achieve.
It is there with -

148
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:38,713
these holy vibrations are with you

149
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:43,557
for every kind of good work you want to do,

150
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:47,764
any kind of Sahaj work you want to do,

151
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:53,926
these vibrations will definitely be there
to guide you,

152
00:18:54,127 --> 00:19:02,139
 to help you, to support you and to love
you. You will be amazed how

153
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,737
people, once they start working for Sahaja
Yoga,

154
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:11,804
how they are blessed from every angle.

155
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:20,719
So, one has to decide in their own minds

156
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:28,623
that all your dreams have to come true.

157
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:35,431
So only thing what you have to do is
to know only that

158
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:43,933
your purpose of life is to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

159
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,256
Even now many Sahaja yogis write to Me,

160
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:50,904
"Mother, this is happening to me, that is
happening,

161
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:57,681
my father like that, mother like that" -
but very few.

162
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:01,898
Practically this is over now.

163
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:09,288
They used to write, I should say, all such
letters,

164
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:14,987
but now I think they are all been perfected,
I don't know what has happened.

165
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:24,792
It's a very unique time where there's light
everywhere,

166
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:36,042
the nature is absolutely with you. You can
see how nature acts,

167
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:40,338
how it is trying to help you and support
you,

168
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,759
and how it wants to work out everything
for you.

169
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:52,174
It is to be just understood and felt

170
00:20:52,770 --> 00:21:02,239
that you are something very special, and
that you have all the help,

171
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:09,859
everyone of you. It's not one person,
two persons,

172
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:17,382
it's not ten persons who - it's the whole
lot, as if the whole ocean

173
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:27,079
is there to help you, help you to swim over
to save so many.

174
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:35,895
You haven't seen such an ocean where there
is so much depth,

175
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:41,438
and all the waves try to save you,

176
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:51,148
to make you float in the realm of joy.

177
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:59,328
All this has happened to you because there
is a purpose.

178
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,441
It's not just because you have done poorva
punyas and all that.

179
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:10,973
Many people say, "Because of previous life
we have got it".

180
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:16,731
That is true. The cause may be that,

181
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:24,181
but the result is that now you are capable
of giving realization to people,

182
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:26,987
and this is what you have to do.

183
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:33,316
All the way you have come here in this
wilderness.

184
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:40,349
From this wilderness only, you will rise

185
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,987
and you will bless all the people
of the world.

186
00:22:45,187 --> 00:22:49,345
Specially America should be blessed again
and again,

187
00:22:49,545 --> 00:23:01,890
because it's the Virat, it is Shri
Krishna's land,

188
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:10,357
because people will always try to follow,
to copy you.

189
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:16,152
Things will improve

190
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:25,823
if you get the, we can say the blessings

191
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:31,481
of the various lotuses you have within
yourself, no doubt.

192
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:37,478
But what about you doing something,

193
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:46,339
what about you doing something about it?
And this is what is very important.

194
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,958
Now only thing what you have to do about
yourself

195
00:23:52,337 --> 00:24:02,356
is to find out about your own activities,

196
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:06,458
what activities you have been doing.

197
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:13,985
You have to find out what have you done,
and what you can do.

198
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:22,149
When you meditate you think about yourself,
how much you have grown,

199
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:28,191
what have you done, what have you given
to others.

200
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:33,516
Whatever you've got, unless and until you
distribute it, it won't increase.

201
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:39,032
That is the fundamental law, and that
works. I've seen people

202
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:45,335
who are realized souls, who are very good,

203
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:48,623
who know everything about Sahaja Yog

204
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:58,316
but are not yet that much confident,
I should say, or that much deep.

205
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:05,885
All this is only possible if you yourself

206
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:14,133
get into creating new Sahaja yogis,

207
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:20,089
and more Sahaja yogis - not for popularity,

208
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:26,591
but for their good and for the good
of the whole.

209
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:33,007
I was asked that I should come and stay
in America

210
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:38,968
so America will improve very much. So now
here I am.

211
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:42,340
I came here, I stayed here,

212
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:50,039
and I am definitely putting all My
attention,

213
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:57,736
because it's a very important, very, very
important chakra

214
00:25:57,937 --> 00:26:04,976
which is this, which is America.

215
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:18,835
And this very important country is doing
sometimes very stupid things.

216
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,939
I would not say that you enter into
politics - no.

217
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,757
I would not say you get into any opposition
and form a group - no.

218
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:32,891
But you also know that you have powers.

219
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:38,817
Even your thought, your desire has powers.

220
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:45,254
Try to experiment with it. Once you
experiment, you will find out

221
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:51,607
that only the attention that you put
to these things, it will work out,

222
00:26:51,892 --> 00:26:55,642
I am sure it will work out.

223
00:26:57,162 --> 00:27:04,623
It is a country which can definitely help

224
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:10,396
for the emancipation of the whole human
beings.

225
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:16,427
But on the contrary, it is going
on the other way round.

226
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,349
I mean, American culture, I don't
understand at all

227
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:28,740
what is American culture is. Is something -

228
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:33,840
they say something, do something else.

229
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:43,834
They've no proper value system which is
accepted by everyone,

230
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:49,038
which is built traditionally from days
together.

231
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:56,675
The value system is so convoluted,
so twisted

232
00:27:56,876 --> 00:28:03,087
that it's only a Sahaja yogi by his
nobility, by his greatness

233
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:07,503
can disentangle these people.

234
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:15,232
They have funny ideas, and those funny
ideas should not

235
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:21,726
deter you, should not stop you; for you
know that they are stupid,

236
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:31,217
they are destructive and they will destroy
all the, all the good qualities.

237
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:37,818
You should know that the responsibility
of Americans

238
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:44,401
is much greater than the responsibility
of any other Sahaja yogis,

239
00:28:44,602 --> 00:28:51,871
because they are accepted and regarded

240
00:28:53,253 --> 00:29:09,542
as the most competent people, as the most
effective people by the divine Power.

241
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:16,973
Divine Power thinks that now you can go
all ahead,

242
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:21,504
you can do so much, and let us see.

243
00:29:21,704 --> 00:29:26,614
Like we have the power and the machinery,

244
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:34,432
but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's
the use of the power? It is useless.

245
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:41,931
So the machinery has to work, and it is
working, it is spreading,

246
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:45,877
but we have to double our efforts.

247
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:50,989
I was thinking of doing some sort
of a social work here

248
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:57,367
so that it will go, it will be caught
in the eyes of many people.

249
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,433
On a subtler level we have worked,

250
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:32,878
but now we have to work it on the surface.

251
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:42,244
Subtler level we are there, we have
achieved and we can achieve much more.

252
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:50,177
But we should come out of it and think
what can we do on the surface,

253
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:58,540
so that people see what is Sahaja Yoga is,
and what it can do to people.

254
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:09,041
It's your personal behavior, your collective
behavior, your national behavior,

255
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:17,790
all are going to change the atmosphere
which is supposed to be superficial,

256
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,204
so that that also becomes subtler.

257
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:28,915
I've been saying this in many places, but
at this puja I think it is important to say

258
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:32,778
that if you are really facing the Adi
Shakti,

259
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:38,468
then you must know your powers are
boundless.

260
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:45,604
You have to just assert those powers.

261
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:51,800
It is not a stationary power. It’s, there's
a movement in it,

262
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,434
and there's a right type of a movement.

263
00:31:55,634 --> 00:32:00,221
It knows where to enter, how to work it
out. Now look at this place.

264
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:05,955
Can you imagine Me thinking about a place
like this?

265
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:09,893
But I was just had in mind of course,
I must say,

266
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:13,809
that we should have some place here,
because

267
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:20,713
the American Sahaja yogis didn't have any
place to meet - that's all.

268
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:23,882
And see how I got it!

269
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:29,836
But the desire to do all this

270
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:36,463
should be there within your subtler level,
and then it works.

271
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:40,244
It works, it's like a magic, I tell you.

272
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:46,440
Now you have faith in yourself and decide
about it.

273
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:54,510
I am so very happy that it has been
achieved

274
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:01,022
with such ease - unbelievable, with such
ease.

275
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:07,259
Absolutely, nothing great was done.

276
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:12,492
The way we got this was so simple,

277
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:18,200
that just like another Sahaja yogi
the person was to sell us

278
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:25,737
came down so excited, and he just sold it
to us, finished.

279
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:31,829
We didn't have to do anything to convince
him

280
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:39,293
or to talk to him or reduce the price -
nothing. And he sold it out to us.

281
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:45,079
In the same way whatever on a subtler level
you desire,

282
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:51,547
it becomes a terrific force which moves
by itself,

283
00:33:51,747 --> 00:34:02,848
which knows where to go, how to enter, into
which area, and it gets the thing done.

284
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:12,138
It's something we all should experience,
and work it out with full confidence.

285
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:17,993
It is the love that we have, the concern
we have.

286
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:24,768
This is the power that has given us
Self-realization, and this is the power

287
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:30,746
that has given us this enrichment
of achievements.

288
00:34:30,947 --> 00:34:35,972
I am sure all of you who are here will
realize

289
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:41,235
how it was done - I mean, so quickly.
This is one of the things

290
00:34:41,435 --> 00:34:49,954
that should just tell you what we are
capable of doing,

291
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:54,281
what we are capable of achieving.

292
00:34:54,482 --> 00:35:03,634
And when you think of so many people who
are lost in the mire of ignorance,

293
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:08,633
we should really feel from inside that
concern

294
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:19,034
and that hankering, "How can I help these
people?"

295
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,600
And you'll be amazed, once you think like
that,

296
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:28,093
how this divine Power, this Force, will
come in.

297
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:36,939
Forget about petty things and petty
problems, they're nothing.

298
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:41,434
You have such a powerful thing behind you.

299
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:47,306
It's true that all this universe was
created, everything was created

300
00:35:47,506 --> 00:35:50,599
and then you were created, and all that
is done.

301
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:55,145
But the greatest thing this Power has done
is to create

302
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:59,457
Sahaja yogis. This is the greatest thing.

303
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:07,784
Those who have knowledge, those who have
the pure knowledge

304
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:15,571
and those who have the divine love in their
heart,

305
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:21,139
what a tremendous personality it is. Just
think of that,

306
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:29,792
and you will get all the opportunities
to express that love.

307
00:36:29,992 --> 00:36:33,350
So may God bless you.
