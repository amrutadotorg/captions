00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:03.083
Bath Public Program, August 7th,1984, England

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.750
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:18.709
It is such a pleasure to come to this old city of Bath.

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:25.000
The Romans who lived here are so much changed today

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:29.500
that it is impossible to locate the Romans who lived here.

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:33.750
Life has changed in these modern times to a very,

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:38.917
very great extent and the ideas about life

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.458
is also very much changed.

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:45.667
As the society has evolved, we reach a point

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:49.125
where we start thinking “What next?”

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:53.834
As if what Romans wanted, the power -

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:55.834
we have enjoyed it now;

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:58.917
then they wanted to have money,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.291
possessions – we have enjoyed all that,

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.125
and seen the nonsense of it;

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:08.709
and now beyond that we are seeking

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:14.417
something more, something that is not known as yet.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:20.834
But there's a feeling that we have to search something

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:27.041
greater, higher, something that is absolute.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:35.583
This special category exists today in thousands,

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:41.291
in millions I should say, all over the world.

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.083
And this I call as the blossom time,

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:47.542
when thousands have to become the fruits.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.917
Is a special time, very, very special time mentioned

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.291
in all the scriptures as the resurrection time,

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:59.041
or the time of judgment,

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:04.083
or Krita Yuga in the Indian scriptures.

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.083
It’s very clearly written about Krita Yuga

00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:08.959
in the Indian scriptures,

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:13.750
that at this time people will have connection

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.166
with the Divine – sakshat.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.041
They will get their realization,

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.709
that they call as “atma sakshatkar”

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.959
and everything will be done,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.041
finished and completed.

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:35.166
This is how they have explained these modern times.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:37.333
But on the other hand,

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:41.583
modern time is a time of complete confusion,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.959
of complete relativity, where people really don't know

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.959
what to do with themselves.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.208
The value system that was very primitive in the beginning

00:02:52.834 --> 00:03:00.125
became somewhat rigid, because of too many boundaries

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.667
to the movement of life, movement of mind.

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:09.875
And then they started breaking the boundaries so much

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:14.750
that they have lost all the shape and forms.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:18.709
There's so much of intermingling into those colors that

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:24.750
we had, that it's hard to recognize what was human being,

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:28.750
what is he and what is he going to be.

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:33.917
The question today faces us is this:

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:38.333
are we born on this earth to live,

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:45.166
have our food, some insurances, and have

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.792
some children, grandchildren and then to die?

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:52.125
It's something like animal’s life, isn't it?

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.041
What's so great of becoming a human being?

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:57.999
So we understand one thing,

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.417
that human beings have a capacity to do something,

00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:04.875
something great for the collective,

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:08.125
for the people who are surrounding them,

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:11.041
for the society in which they live.

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:17.875
And this itself has given rise within us to this awakening,

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:21.166
that we have to find out a way and method

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:25.000
by which we do things for the collective,

00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:26.999
for the rest of the world.

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:30.041
It's very, very evident,

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:33.291
this awareness that we cannot live alone,

00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:36.667
there has to be some sort of a connection with the whole,

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:39.333
and that we should find out that connection

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:43.917
by which we can really spread the goodness,

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.083
the virtuousness, the bliss of peace.

00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:52.291
Now the main thing is that

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.959
when we start doing any such work,

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:56.583
or any such social work

00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:03.250
or any such helpful work for the collective,

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:08.500
we develop some sort of an ego within ourselves.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.041
Is a very common thing.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:15.625
Like I was a president of one of the organization in India,

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:18.083
called President of the Blinds.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:23.500
And when they wanted to invite the governor – see,

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:30.041
very prominent ladies, of very high-ranking families –

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:32.792
they had a big quarrel among themselves:

00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:34.917
who is going to sit next to the governor?

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:36.959
I was quite amazed at them, you see.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.125
I said, “Because you'll be facing the blind,

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:43.458
and blind can't see a governor from another person.

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:45.999
And what is there to fight about this,

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.542
that who is going to sit next to the governor?”

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.250
And it was so surprising that the fight became so severe

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.166
that one could not find out any solutions;

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.250
so I used some humor to say,

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:03.375
“All right, what we will do, we'll put a big plank

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:06.834
on top of the head of the governor,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.125
and some can sit like sparrows on one side

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.208
and some can on other side!"

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:14.125
And only with that kind of a humor I could neutralize

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:15.667
their ideas;

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:19.625
because even when they are so educated,

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.667
they are well-placed in life,

00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:23.500
they are very well-off people

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:26.417
and they want to help others because they think that

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:32.250
we must help the poor, the people who need our money

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.709
or maybe our guidance, and they come out,

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:36.709
give their time, money and all that,

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:41.125
and they end up so stupidly about that social work.

00:06:42.417 --> 00:06:46.333
So it amounts to this, that when we try to help anyone,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.500
actually what do we do is to help ourselves.

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:55.500
Because we can't bear it within ourselves,

00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:57.959
that's why we are trying to help another person.

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:02.208
But the trouble is, the awareness of this is not there,

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:08.041
and that's why people suffer from either the ego

00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:09.458
or some sort of a conditioning

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.999
when they come closer to another society.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.999
Like any society, take it now.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:19.792
For example, I'm now in British society we can say,

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:21.417
or English society.

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:24.959
When I come here, immediately you have to adjust

00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.917
yourself to that society.

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.834
For example, I wear this red mark.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.417
So everybody will laugh at you, make fun of you.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.500
Then you'll start wondering, what is this?

00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:36.333
And you'll just rub it off, you see, because you'll think that

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:37.959
something funny is happening.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.041
Like in India if you go and if you put on lipstick

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:41.458
in the villages, people will say

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:43.959
what's wrong with this lady, why is she putting on lipstick,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.959
you see – it's not supposed to put there.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.917
So then everybody will laugh and see that this is

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.125
something funny she's doing, and she will try then

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.542
to adjust herself to their requirements;

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.959
and that's how we get into our conditionings.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:03.375
So either, when you are dealing with the society you

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:07.333
either develop your ego, or you develop your superego

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:08.959
or your conditioning.

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:12.333
So what is the problem, why do we develop these things?

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:13.583
We should not.

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:17.208
We should stand on our right, we should stand as we are,

00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:20.000
and we should see the whole world as a witness.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.667
So the problem is this, that when you deal with the society

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:26.291
you must know

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.083
that you are the part and parcel of the whole;

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:33.375
that everyone you see, whether he is English, Indian

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:37.959
or Arabic are all part and parcel of one great being

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:40.999
called God Almighty.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.667
And when these parts are not awakened,

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.417
then they think they are separate

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:48.709
and they fight among themselves,

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.041
or they condition each other or they challenge the ego,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.417
and like that it goes on.

00:08:54.834 --> 00:09:00.834
But once they’re aware about this collectivity,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.500
that they are part and parcel of the whole,

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:08.333
they become one, they start moving in unison.

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:12.083
Like in helium gas experiment they have found out that

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.834
when you start reducing the temperature of helium gas,

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:19.250
all the molecules which were fighting with the heat

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:22.750
just cool down, and they become so collective

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.125
that their movement and everything

00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:27.917
goes in the same direction, like the birds,

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.166
they move according to the leader –

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:32.875
in the same way the movement starts.

00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:36.041
This happening has to take place within us

00:09:36.458 --> 00:09:38.875
when we talk that we have to have

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.375
peace in this world,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.041
we have to have all the best things,

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:47.500
and that people should live peacefully and happily.

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:49.667
This is what we have to know, that

00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:53.834
human beings as they are require a transformation.

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:56.125
Unless and until they transform to this new

00:09:56.583 --> 00:09:58.250
awareness of collectivity,

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:02.166
they cannot adjust themselves to society, to another person.

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:04.667
Also, you will see that you meet a friend,

00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:07.375
you say “he's my friend” or you say “he's my brother”

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.625
or “she's my sister” – this “my” business starts coming,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.542
and you feel it's something very close relationship.

00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:17.291
But suddenly you discover that “No, he's my enemy.”

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.125
And then you can become such enemies

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:25.834
that you would not believe that you were ever friends,

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:29.417
and that you will also expose the another person

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:32.709
to such an extent that you are amazed at yourself.

00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:36.750
This happens to us because we do not know

00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:40.208
about the person with whom we are friendly

00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:43.458
that he's also part and parcel of the whole;

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:47.583
and that we have to awaken that in him,

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:49.917
that awareness, so that he realizes

00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:52.750
that we are all part and parcel of the whole.

00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:59.000
Now, within us lies the power

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.667
to make us collectively conscious.

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:04.999
And this power is lying in the triangular bone

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.208
called the sacrum, which we know as Kundalini,

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:13.250
but in the Bible it is described as the Holy Ghost.

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:18.083
Now this Holy Ghost that we know about in the Bible

00:11:18.458 --> 00:11:20.583
is very ambiguous for many people,

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:24.208
because it is not clearly described what this Holy Ghost is.

00:11:24.709 --> 00:11:26.250
And I asked a priest, I said,

00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:27.999
“What do you mean by Holy Ghost?”

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.333
So he said, “I'm agnostic."

00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:32.458
So I asked him, “Then what are you doing there

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.333
If you are a gnostic, if you don’t believe in it

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:36.250
then what are you doing there?”

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:38.250
He says, “I'm doing my job.”

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:41.750
So the whole thing boils down to a job for them,

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:43.458
when they cannot explain it.

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:45.625
But it can be very clearly explained

00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:49.999
that this is the power of the Primordial Mother.

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:52.917
We have the Father and we have the Son,

00:11:53.417 --> 00:11:56.417
but what about the Mother?

00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:59.250
Have you heard of a father and a son without the mother?

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:04.458
So this is the Primordial Mother who is the Holy Ghost,

00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:08.250
and She is the one reflected within us as the Kundalini

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:10.291
in the triangular bone.

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:15.834
Now, this triangular bone is very important because it was

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:19.083
called by Greeks as “sacrum”, meaning “sacred”.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.291
So they knew about it, that there's something sacred lying

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:28.583
in this place which is a power, or maybe they knew it was

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.291
the Holy Ghost.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.959
Whatever it was, they knew, because they called it

00:12:33.291 --> 00:12:34.458
the sacrum bone.

00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:38.125
Now within us there are seven centers,

00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:42.041
as I explained to you yesterday in Bristol,

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.750
that we have seven centers within us

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:46.333
which are subtle centers.

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:50.542
Now these centers exist within us.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.667
But you can ask Me, “Mother, why should we believe?"

00:12:53.667 --> 00:12:55.875
Ah, you should not, you should not believe Me,

00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:58.959
but take it scientifically as a hypothesis.

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.709
And if I prove it to you, then you will know

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:04.792
that what I'm saying is true.

00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:07.333
So these centers reside within us,

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:14.417
and these centers on the outside express themselves,

00:13:14.792 --> 00:13:18.083
manifest themselves in gross ways in different plexuses,

00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:20.083
which doctors know about.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.166
Now these centers are there, and a very subtler point –

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:26.875
like the first center, as I told you,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.500
is the center of innocence.

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:33.917
The second one is the center of our creativity.

00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:41.291
The third one is the center of our seeking.

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:47.709
We seek food, then we seek shelter,

00:13:48.208 --> 00:13:53.000
then we seek money, possessions, power, love:

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.000
all this comes through this center, which manifests

00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.500
outside as the solar plexus.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.500
Above that is the center of –

00:14:04.083 --> 00:14:05.625
we call it the center of the Mother,

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:09.625
because this center is the one that gives you protection.

00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:11.750
This center has a speciality,

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.208
that underneath lies the sternum bone.

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:16.792
And in the sternum bone,

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:18.917
till you are about twelve years of age,

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.041
the antibodies are created.

00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:24.208
They are like the soldiers of the Mother

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:27.834
and these soldiers are available in the sternum bone,

00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:33.375
and the sternum bone is in charge of these soldiers all around.

00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:36.583
Now when there is an attack or

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:40.959
when there is something that frightens you,

00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:45.000
suddenly the sternum bone starts pulsating.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.959
When it starts pulsating or moving then as a result

00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:54.625
of that happening, the antibodies get information –

00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:58.333
like you get information through the ether;

00:14:58.709 --> 00:15:00.542
you don't see the ether, but you can get information –

00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:02.999
in the same way, they are like radios

00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:05.208
and they receive the information,

00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:09.000
and they start attacking, attacking anything

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.375
that is trying to disturb the personality.

00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:16.999
Then above that is the center, what we call here is

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.709
the Vishuddhi Chakra, is the center where human beings

00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:22.667
raised their head up.

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:25.625
This is the center that has made us a human being,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.999
and from this center only rises the ego and superego,

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:33.208
because this is the center of collectivity.

00:15:33.709 --> 00:15:36.291
Because we speak through this center, we talk through

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:39.250
this, we have rapport with other people through this, and

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.166
as a reaction to that, ego and superego is built within us.

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:48.083
When that is built within us, we become a personality –

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.875
I am some, he is some, you are some – at that point we

00:15:53.417 --> 00:16:02.750
become a person who has the consciousness of  I-ness.

00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:07.792
Like then I’ll say “I like this, I want this.”

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:10.250
Say, I will say “I am an Indian,” you’ll say

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:11.709
“I am an Englishman.”

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:15.166
All these misidentifications start because you become an

00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:19.750
individual who tries to identify with many things.

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:24.625
That's how we become separated from that power.

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:29.709
This is the freedom we get, where we have to ourself

00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:32.458
learn from our errors and trial

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:35.000
what is right and what is wrong.

00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:39.542
Then above that lies the center here – is of Christ.

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:41.500
This is the window of Christ, I should say.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.417
But this center is very important, because this center

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.583
controls these two institutions of ego and superego.

00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:54.959
That's why it is said that Christ died for our sins.

00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:59.750
When you awaken Christ in that center, then He sucks in

00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:05.500
these two institutions or these two balloon-like structures.

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:10.166
He sucks in, so that our karmas – which are talked of,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.417
that we have done bad karmas and we have done this

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.250
and that – all that goes into it, and our sins and

00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:18.417
our conditioning all are sucked in.

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:24.291
And we enter into the kingdom of God,

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:27.291
which is the limbic area in the medical terminology.

00:17:27.291 --> 00:17:30.250
But from here you have to pierce through;

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:33.375
and this piercing through is the destination,

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:35.959
is the destination through which you have to come out,

00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:39.417
and is placed at the fontanel bone area

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:41.250
where you get your baptism.

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:43.333
But baptism, as I told you yesterday,

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.959
is just an artificial exercise.

00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:50.083
Actual baptism is when this Holy Ghost rises and you

00:17:50.417 --> 00:17:54.999
start really feeling the cool breeze on top of your head.

00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:58.083
This is a miracle. It is!

00:17:58.583 --> 00:18:01.667
Not to believe in miracle is not correct.

00:18:01.959 --> 00:18:04.041
You should keep yourself open.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:05.834
Even you may be an intellectual,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.667
you must be honest about it

00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:10.041
that if you have not known a miracle

00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:12.333
that doesn’t mean there are no miracles and

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.667
that miracles do not happen.

00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:20.291
But keep the point of view of a scientist who sees,

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.792
wants to see for himself if it is so.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:27.542
Now this miracle happens when the Kundalini rises,

00:18:27.917 --> 00:18:30.208
pierces through all these centers and pierces through here.

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:37.583
Now, how these centers are constructed,

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:39.500
we should see that also very clearly.

00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:42.792
We have in our body an autonomous nervous system.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.709
“Auto” is a word means “myself.”

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.959
But who is this self? Who is this auto?

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.500
Doctors don't know about it,

00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:52.333
they have just given a name, “autonomous.”

00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:55.291
Now this autonomous has two systems: one is

00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:57.792
the sympathetic, another is the parasympathetic.

00:18:58.125 --> 00:18:59.917
Now, the sympathetic system we use

00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:01.375
when we are in emergency,

00:19:01.834 --> 00:19:03.291
because supposing we are running very fast,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.834
then the sympathetic goes into action

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.583
and you get a very strong heartbeat.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.375
Also the beat is much faster than normal.

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:17.542
This is done by the sympathetic activity.

00:19:17.917 --> 00:19:20.458
You can raise the – raise the, always,

00:19:20.875 --> 00:19:23.166
the rate of your heartbeat,

00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:25.917
but it reduces automatically.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.959
How? It is done by the parasympathetic,

00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.667
which is in the center.

00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:34.000
Now these three channels, as you see,

00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:36.458
are the channels – one on the left-hand side

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:39.999
is the left sympathetic channel,

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:42.291
but it’s the subtle channel which expresses outside

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:44.959
as the left sympathetic.

00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:47.291
Then right side is the right sympathetic,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.625
and in the center is the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:56.208
which is also responsible for our evolutionary process.

00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:59.917
So now we have evolved up to the human stage.

00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:03.750
This is not the end, because if it was the end

00:20:04.083 --> 00:20:05.542
we would have known everything.

00:20:05.959 --> 00:20:07.166
But we do not know everything.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.834
We have to jump into another awareness,

00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:11.125
which Christ has described –

00:20:11.458 --> 00:20:14.500
the second birth; but not of flesh, or not of changing

00:20:14.917 --> 00:20:16.750
clothes or doing something outward thing, but it's a

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:19.875
happening within you that makes you something.

00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:22.999
You become something. It’s a question of becoming.

00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:27.875
It is not that you become just a member of some group

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.458
or you say, “All right, I belong to this group” or

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:32.917
“I wear this kind of a dress. I do this kind of a thing.”

00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:34.166
That's not the way.

00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:37.667
It's actual happening that takes place within you,

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:40.208
and that makes you a realized soul.

00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:43.625
If you have to become something,

00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:46.250
if it has to happen within you,

00:20:46.709 --> 00:20:50.583
then that is the one we should call as the real truth.

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.875
It has to be felt on the central nervous system,

00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:56.083
like you have become a human being.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.375
You can feel the dirt and filth, you can see the colors,

00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:03.333
you can see the beautiful patterns, everything,

00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:06.999
because you are a human being.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:10.208
But for a dog it doesn't matter whether it's dirty, filthy –

00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:12.208
it doesn't smell that.

00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:13.750
So in the same way,

00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:16.959
when you have to become something higher,

00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:21.709
then is to be felt on your central nervous system.

00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:24.458
It's not just a mental projection to say,

00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:27.291
“Oh, I believe in this, I believe in that.

00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:28.709
I don't believe in that.”

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:30.208
It's not that way at all.

00:21:30.542 --> 00:21:34.583
It is to be felt on your central nervous system;

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:38.041
on your fingertips you have to feel it.

00:21:38.417 --> 00:21:41.834
And how do you feel it is very spontaneous,

00:21:42.208 --> 00:21:43.792
because it is a living process.

00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:50.166
It's not at all difficult; it's not at all any way challenging.

00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:52.166
It is all built in within you;

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.083
it is extremely simple.

00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:58.500
Like a seed you are, and once you are planted

00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:02.542
onto the Mother Earth, spontaneously you sprout.

00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:04.750
It’s such a spontaneous happening

00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.166
that it is difficult for human beings to believe

00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.291
that you can do it without any effort,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.583
or that you cannot pay for it.

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:15.000
This is something, for human beings,

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:16.625
an impossible situation:

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.834
now how can you get something without paying?

00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:21.542
But we get so many things without paying,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
and if this is the epitome of your evolution,

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:28.959
you have not paid for your evolution so far,

00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:30.750
so why should you pay for it?

00:22:31.291 --> 00:22:33.375
And there has not to be any effort.

00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:39.667
So “Sahaja Yoga” means spontaneous union with the Divine.

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:44.041
“Saha” is with,  “ja” is born,  that is spontaneous,

00:22:44.542 --> 00:22:45.583
born with you:

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:48.417
everybody has a right to get this union with the Divine.

00:22:48.917 --> 00:22:52.291
The another meaning of the word “Divine” is that

00:22:54.625 --> 00:23:00.125
the power of God that is all-pervading,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.542
which does all the living work –

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:07.750
like transformation of flower into fruit, different seasons –

00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:11.041
all that is living is done by this power.

00:23:11.709 --> 00:23:14.625
And this Divine, you have to become one.

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:18.000
You have to feel it on your fingertips.

00:23:18.417 --> 00:23:22.458
This yoga also means the deftness, means also

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:28.083
the complete knowledge about this divine power,

00:23:28.542 --> 00:23:32.834
how to handle it, how to work it out and how to use it.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.458
By awakening of this Kundalini,

00:23:35.792 --> 00:23:38.417
as a by-product you get your physical health.

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:41.333
I've said many a times that cancer cannot be cured by

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.542
anything else but by the Kundalini awakening.

00:23:44.917 --> 00:23:47.583
Yesterday I explained to you how cancer is caused,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.333
and how Kundalini clears it out.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.875
Most of your diseases come because

00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:54.875
the centers are out of gear,

00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:57.417
they have broken their relationship with the whole,

00:23:57.875 --> 00:24:01.834
or maybe that there’s something lacking in the centers.

00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:05.999
When the Kundalini rises she only nourishes them so well

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:09.166
that with that nourishment all these center, your mental,

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.542
physical, emotional centers get completely satisfied

00:24:14.959 --> 00:24:19.583
and fulfilled, and they become healthy.

00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:24.875
With that you get good health, good mind

00:24:25.291 --> 00:24:27.542
and good balanced emotional life.

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:33.458
But last of all, when she crosses this limit, this is the,

00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:37.750
this is the place where resides the God Almighty.

00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:40.083
Now, I'm saying again that you are not to believe Me,

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:42.542
because people don’t believe in God also these days.

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:46.792
So I say that this is the place of God Almighty

00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:47.959
on top of your head,

00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:50.500
but He is reflected in your heart as spirit;

00:24:50.917 --> 00:24:53.667
and as soon as the Kundalini touches that seat,

00:24:57.041 --> 00:25:01.917
the hands start flowing with cool breeze in the hand.

00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:05.208
First you feel the cool breeze of your own Kundalini

00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:08.834
coming up and then the grace starts flowing through you,

00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:13.125
and you feel the grace in your hand as cool breeze flowing.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.792
So it happens.

00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:17.917
Once it happens you have to establish yourself a little bit,

00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:19.875
you have to understand it, what it is and

00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:24.208
It takes at the most for some people only one day

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.083
but some people a month or so,

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.709
and then you become the master.

00:25:28.709 --> 00:25:31.667
You become a different personality, you become

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.166
so powerful and so compassionate;

00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:37.834
very compassionate and very powerful like Christ, you see.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.750
When people were trying to throw stones

00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:43.792
at Mary Magdalene – she was a prostitute,

00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:45.041
and He stood against it.

00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:47.875
He had nothing to do with prostitutes as such,

00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:51.542
but He stood against all the people and He said,

00:25:51.834 --> 00:25:54.959
“Now those who have not committed any sin

00:25:55.291 --> 00:25:56.375
can throw the stones at Me.”

00:25:56.959 --> 00:25:59.667
And nobody would do it, because He’s such a powerful,

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:01.875
compassionate person.

00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:02.917
And that's what it is,

00:26:03.417 --> 00:26:06.083
you become a person identified with truth.

00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:07.792
You are not afraid of anyone,

00:26:08.208 --> 00:26:11.917
you always tell the truth and will tell with great power.

00:26:11.917 --> 00:26:14.792
Like you had a great poet like William Blake,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.375
who has said about these modern times

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.166
that at this time the men of God –

00:26:20.542 --> 00:26:22.458
means the people who are seeking God or

00:26:22.834 --> 00:26:27.208
who are believing in God – will become prophets

00:26:27.792 --> 00:26:30.542
and they'll have power to make others prophet.

00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:33.959
This is exactly what Sahaja Yoga does, that you get your

00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:37.375
realization and you start giving realization to another.

00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:40.750
Like an enlightened light can enlighten another light

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.083
which is not enlightened,

00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:43.834
and then that enlightened light

00:26:44.291 --> 00:26:45.625
enlighten many other lights.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Is simple as that.

00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:49.500
There’s nothing to take or give, it's just a catalyst,

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:53.458
that you enlighten another light and that person

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.000
enlightens another light.

00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:58.000
So there is no obligation, there’s nothing give and take,

00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:02.333
but it’s just a simple happening that you can understand.

00:27:02.667 --> 00:27:05.417
This Dr. Warren himself has given realization

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.667
to thousands of people.

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.166
Even in Madras I could not go, I sent him and he gave

00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:11.250
realization to three hundred people.

00:27:11.709 --> 00:27:13.375
Like in India we have somebody who has given

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.083
realization to ten thousand people. It's a fact.

00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:17.834
And you can verify it.

00:27:18.208 --> 00:27:20.500
When you yourself get your realization you'll be surprised

00:27:20.917 --> 00:27:22.709
that you can give realization to people

00:27:23.125 --> 00:27:24.250
and you can cure them.

00:27:24.625 --> 00:27:26.750
You can give them peace and bliss of God.

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:30.834
Then at that time you become collectively conscious;

00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:33.375
you become part and parcel of the whole.

00:27:33.834 --> 00:27:35.834
Like many people had the catch yesterday

00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.583
on the Vishuddhi Chakra – because of certain reasons,

00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:40.875
some troubles, some had spondylitis,

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.583
some had something – and they couldn't cross this thing.

00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:45.458
Only they had to say three times,

00:27:45.959 --> 00:27:48.375
“Mother, I am the part and parcel of the whole,”

00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:50.500
and they started feeling the cool breeze.

00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:52.041
It's so simple as that.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.999
And they started feeling the cool breeze,

00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:55.542
because they were obstructed here.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.875
So it's very simple methods which even a child can do,

00:27:59.291 --> 00:28:02.208
which you can do is there, and I hope today

00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:05.667
in this place which is so beautiful, Bath,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.709
we will all receive this realization.

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:12.458
May God bless you all.

00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:16.500
If you have any questions, you should ask Me.

00:28:17.375 --> 00:28:19.834
But yesterday two persons asked so many questions.

00:28:20.208 --> 00:28:23.041
I wasted lot of time with them and then they walked out.

00:28:23.999 --> 00:28:26.291
They were just people sent by some guru or someone

00:28:26.583 --> 00:28:29.417
who was just trying to ask questions,

00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.000
identified with some wrong gurus.

00:28:31.417 --> 00:28:33.083
And here are so many people sitting at your back

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.250
who have been to all kinds of wrong gurus,

00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:37.250
and we had to treat them and get them better.

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:40.000
Some were suffering from epilepsy, some from cancer,

00:28:40.375 --> 00:28:43.542
some from this and some from that, and they paid for it,

00:28:43.959 --> 00:28:45.417
getting all these diseases and troubles.

00:28:45.792 --> 00:28:47.792
Some have ended up in the lunatic asylums.

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:50.959
So I would request you, don't be identified with these gurus.

00:28:51.291 --> 00:28:53.041
Even if you have paid – forget it.

00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:55.500
Doesn't matter. Don't be identified with them.

00:28:55.875 --> 00:28:57.291
Be identified with your Self.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.125
And this is your property, it's your own,

00:29:00.458 --> 00:29:01.959
you should know it.

00:29:02.291 --> 00:29:04.959
That's what is My humble request to all of you.

00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:08.375
May God bless you. Thank you very much.

00:29:13.917 --> 00:29:15.458
Yogi: Any questions?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I've found some benefit in a Tibetan humming meditation

00:29:36.291 --> 00:29:39.959
Nada Brahma. Is this meditation compatible with Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:40.417 --> 00:29:43.500
Not at all. Not at all.

00:29:43.917 --> 00:29:46.458
You see, this Nada Brahma is, what is the benefit one

00:29:46.834 --> 00:29:51.792
gets is that you go on humming and humming like that,

00:29:52.208 --> 00:29:53.333
and a day will come

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:55.458
when your head will be humming all the time.

00:29:56.417 --> 00:29:58.375
Now I'll tell you the reason for that, it's like this.

00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:04.250
Supposing we say anything, like we start saying “Aum” or

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.375
“Hum” or anything, we do not become.

00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:11.999
Supposing I say “I am the governor of this place” –

00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:16.375
do I become? If I say I am “Aum” – do I become?

00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:19.792
By saying thing, can we become something?

00:30:20.083 --> 00:30:22.291
If we profess something, do we become?

00:30:22.667 --> 00:30:25.458
Something has to happen within.

00:30:25.834 --> 00:30:29.000
Unless and until that happens, it has no meaning, it's all

00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:30.542
outside.

00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:31.959
You can say anything.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.250
Somebody can say I have some benefits because I have

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.417
been saying prayers.

00:30:36.792 --> 00:30:37.792
That's not the thing.

00:30:38.208 --> 00:30:40.417
It’s a complete transformation that you must have.

00:30:40.792 --> 00:30:42.917
And these are very dangerous things, very, very

00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:46.125
dangerous; because in the Tibet now, for example,

00:30:46.458 --> 00:30:50.709
Lama himself is a mess, I tell you, he's a big mess.

00:30:50.999 --> 00:30:55.250
I went to China with My husband and I was really amazed

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.375
– you might call it a propaganda, whatever it is –

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.999
to see in Lhasa this gentleman accumulated such wealth

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.458
that it could be compared with the wealth of Pope.

00:31:06.792 --> 00:31:12.166
He used to take his wine in a full gold goblet which was all

00:31:12.417 --> 00:31:15.625
carved, and he had number of them.

00:31:15.625 --> 00:31:17.291
His plate was made of gold,

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.583
his everything was made of real gold.

00:31:19.917 --> 00:31:21.917
And from where did he get this money? Imagine -

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:25.000
from these Tibetans who were poor people.

00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:26.000
They are so poor:

00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:28.542
they have no clothes, nothing to cover themselves.

00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:30.667
I don't say Communism is a very good thing,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.625
but what I say, that these people really exploited them.

00:31:34.917 --> 00:31:38.750
The whole of that Lhasa exhibition was such an eye-opener.

00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:44.667
Oh God! These people have looted these poor peopple,

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:47.291
and how much they have suffered.

00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:49.999
If you go and see now Tibet, you’ll be amazed.

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.542
The people don't know, they are so confused.

00:31:52.542 --> 00:31:55.291
They don't understand. They have given everything

00:31:55.709 --> 00:31:57.917
that they had to this Mr. Lama.

00:31:58.458 --> 00:32:02.291
He's touring now everywhere; no one knows what is he up to.

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:04.792
What benefit can they give?

00:32:05.375 --> 00:32:06.583
It's a myth.

00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:08.875
The best benefit is that you become a master.

00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.125
You know each and everything.

00:32:10.542 --> 00:32:12.291
You know what is Kundalini, you know how to give

00:32:12.583 --> 00:32:15.333
realization other, and everything you must do.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.750
That’s the main thing.

00:32:16.999 --> 00:32:19.125
In the beginning, you do feel nice with anything,

00:32:19.417 --> 00:32:21.500
even with a drink.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.083
For the time being, in the same way,

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.667
if you are humming somebody's name you might get

00:32:25.917 --> 00:32:27.917
possessed for a while and you may feel all right.

00:32:28.208 --> 00:32:29.959
Like T.M. has the same problem.

00:32:30.291 --> 00:32:32.834
T.M. people do some mantras: for the time being they feel

00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:35.458
relaxed because somebody else comes into your mind,

00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:38.709
he takes over and he starts managing your show.

00:32:38.999 --> 00:32:40.375
And when he starts managing your show, you feel

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:41.542
relaxed.

00:32:41.834 --> 00:32:43.417
But relaxation is not the thing.

00:32:43.709 --> 00:32:45.667
You do not become a master.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.667
That's the point is: when you become one with the whole,

00:32:49.959 --> 00:32:52.458
then you are relaxed because nothing is exhausted.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.041
All the time you are relaxed.

00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:57.000
But see these lamas how they look, all wrinkled, you

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.375
know, you can count their wrinkles one by one.

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:00.709
Horrible people.

00:33:00.709 --> 00:33:03.875
You cannot say that they have anything great about them.

00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:05.458
And what good have they done?

00:33:05.458 --> 00:33:07.959
I haven't seen any lama doing any good to anyone.

00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:11.792
I had a chance of sitting next to this Dalai Lama once in a

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:15.542
dinner party when My husband was with the Prime Minister

00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:19.291
and he was called, and because the Prime MInister

00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:22.625
and because the Prime Minister’s wife would not sit,

00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:25.333
so I was sitting next to him, and I felt so hot.

00:33:25.709 --> 00:33:27.333
And the Prime Minister was Lal Bahadur Shastri and

00:33:27.792 --> 00:33:31.333
he just could – he knew all about it, about Me and he said,

00:33:31.583 --> 00:33:32.792
"Are You feeling very hot with him?"

00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:34.291
because he was a realized soul himself.

00:33:34.709 --> 00:33:36.208
I said, “Yes, terrible.”  he said, “All right,

00:33:36.458 --> 00:33:39.083
then put the another foreign minister in between."

00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:40.500
He made Me sit on the other side

00:33:40.792 --> 00:33:42.125
and the foreign minister sat there.

00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:44.000
Till you are realized you will not know.

00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:46.375
And also I must tell you, when you go to these people

00:33:46.709 --> 00:33:49.667
it's difficult for you to get realization – that also is there;

00:33:49.999 --> 00:33:51.959
because they create a problem within you.

00:33:52.166 --> 00:33:55.500
With any effort you go onto sympathetic nervous system.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.291
Any effort, as I told you, you go to sympathetic nervous

00:33:58.542 --> 00:34:00.583
system, so your sympathetic gets activated.

00:34:00.583 --> 00:34:02.166
When your sympathetic gets activated,

00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:04.583
you either move to the left or to the right.

00:34:04.875 --> 00:34:05.834
When you move to the left,

00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:07.583
you go to the collective subconscious.

00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:10.041
That is the place which is all dead within us

00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:11.583
since our creation.

00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:14.458
And cancer, as I told you yesterday, is caused by the

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.500
entities from that area.

00:34:16.917 --> 00:34:19.500
And if you go to the right side – most of these lamas put

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.542
you on the right.

00:34:21.041 --> 00:34:23.750
Do you know, Hitler was guided by Lama?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.917
Dalai Lama was his guru.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.041
He taught him how to capture the minds of people and put

00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:32.041
them onto this kind of a thing.

00:34:32.458 --> 00:34:35.208
It's a well-known fact. It was Dalai Lama was his guru.

00:34:35.458 --> 00:34:36.999
All these lamas are like that.

00:34:37.291 --> 00:34:38.417
But when you are realized,

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:40.208
then only you will know what they are.

00:34:40.583 --> 00:34:43.999
Like My grand-daughter is, was about five years –

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.917
she's a realized soul; while My daughter and son-in-law

00:34:46.917 --> 00:34:48.291
were not realized souls.

00:34:48.709 --> 00:34:51.333
And once they went to Ladakh and the lama was sitting,

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:53.333
you see, on a mount.

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:55.041
And everybody was going and bowing to him,

00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:56.333
but she didn't like it.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.458
And when the parents went and bowed to him

00:34:59.458 --> 00:35:01.667
she got very angry – she was only five years.

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:04.083
She just put back her hands like this, stood before him.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.125
She said, “By wearing this maxi,

00:35:06.417 --> 00:35:08.125
do you think you have become a realized soul?

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.333
You are not. You have no business to ask people to bow

00:35:11.834 --> 00:35:13.709
to ask people to bow before you. What business have you got?"

00:35:13.999 --> 00:35:15.125
And they were so shocked and embarrassed,

00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:16.208
they said, “Don’t say like … ”

00:35:16.458 --> 00:35:19.667
“No, why did you bow to him? He's not to be bowed.”

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Just imagine!

00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:22.917
But unless and until you are realized …

00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:25.625
Also it's very difficult, because they have a very nice

00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:31.583
business propositions, they have very nice advertising

00:35:31.834 --> 00:35:33.375
agencies.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.667
Like the other day I went to Spain, I was shocked.

00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:38.375
There's another thing these lamas have started, that we

00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:42.083
have to go to Gobi Desert, Gobi Desert. Now imagine!

00:35:42.417 --> 00:35:44.875
That Gobi Desert is a place where you go for even one

00:35:45.083 --> 00:35:46.333
mile, you'll be finished.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.709
For nirvana you go to Gobi Desert.

00:35:49.041 --> 00:35:50.959
So take all the money from the people now, they prepare

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.417
nicely and take crowds of people to Gobi Desert.

00:35:54.667 --> 00:35:57.000
Poor things are walking towards their death –

00:35:57.333 --> 00:35:59.125
and they call “it’s a nirvana.” They never return.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.999
So they have gone to their nirvana, they are not returned.

00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:04.083
This is how they are working it out.

00:36:04.417 --> 00:36:06.083
I've had people in England –

00:36:06.333 --> 00:36:07.542
there was one fellow called Omkar.

00:36:07.917 --> 00:36:09.458
His name was given as Omkar by some –

00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:11.959
I don't know what lama gave him that name,

00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:14.625
because normally they don't have Omkar name.

00:36:14.917 --> 00:36:16.375
So I said, “Who gave you this name?”

00:36:16.667 --> 00:36:20.083
He said, “I went to a monastery.” And what happened?

00:36:20.375 --> 00:36:22.208
All his bones were broken.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.834
He said, “They beat me on my back.” Just imagine.

00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:28.166
How can that be?

00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:29.750
All his bones were broken.

00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:32.417
And it was impossible to give him realization, because

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.417
physically it was impossible.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.625
But slowly and steadily he is now recovering.

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:39.750
He's like a madman.

00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:43.333
How can you be cruel?

00:36:45.917 --> 00:36:48.999
So Tibetans, are they very realized souls, you think?

00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:52.583
What is there to learn from Tibetans?

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.834
Anybody who is foreign need not be a learned

00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:02.500
personality.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.250
Whatever is written in the book need not be a scripture.

00:37:08.709 --> 00:37:12.458
You should understand that all these things have come up

00:37:12.959 --> 00:37:16.250
just after Buddha's death.

00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:19.291
It has happened with every religion, with every great

00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:22.667
personality came on this earth, it has happened.

00:37:22.999 --> 00:37:29.792
But it is in the old caves the saints who lived after Buddha

00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:32.583
have written that it is a spontaneous happening.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.542
But Buddha did not talk of God because He thought,

00:37:35.834 --> 00:37:37.375
“First talk of the Self.

00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:39.625
Because if you talk of God, people immediately start

00:37:39.917 --> 00:37:41.375
thinking they have become God.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.999
So better talk of Self; let them get their Self-realization.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.041
Unless and until they get Self-realization,

00:37:47.375 --> 00:37:49.000
how will they understand God?”

00:37:49.375 --> 00:37:51.500
So they are called, He is called as Anishwar, means

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.458
He doesn't believe in God, an atheist: it's not so.

00:37:54.709 --> 00:37:56.792
He just deliberately did it because He thought,

00:37:57.083 --> 00:38:01.375
if you talk of something far-fetched then people live

00:38:01.709 --> 00:38:03.250
in an imaginary world.

00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:06.583
So what He wanted practically to have Self-realization

00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:09.999
first, and then the knowledge about God.

00:38:09.999 --> 00:38:13.041
Because for a blind person, no use telling him about

00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:15.834
the whole thing, before first tell him that

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.458
“you must have your vision.”

00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:28.125
The other day we had one lady from Buddhist meditation,

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.500
she couldn't get her realization, I'm sorry to say, though

00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:34.166
we can work it out gradually; but she couldn't get it.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.625
Because you see, Buddha resides within us, on this side

00:38:38.959 --> 00:38:40.250
here.

00:38:40.583 --> 00:38:43.208
And this is the portion gets very much swollen up when

00:38:43.542 --> 00:38:47.125
you do Buddhist meditation and we have to reduce it with

00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:52.291
certain mantras, otherwise you cannot reduce it.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.750
One has to work hard for such people – doesn't matter.

00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:58.959
Because you are all seekers it's your right to have it,

00:38:59.417 --> 00:39:02.333
and I am here to work for you.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.166
Any other question, please?

00:39:08.458 --> 00:39:10.458
Lady in audience comments on how people

00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:12.542
don’t want to know about the spirit.

00:39:12.792 --> 00:39:15.417
Yes, that's the problem in England.

00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:25.875
I know, I know. I know that's the problem today is that

00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:28.333
they don't want to know and they are very skeptical.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.333
But things are working out nicely now.

00:39:30.667 --> 00:39:34.208
You see, what it is after all, God is also anxious that

00:39:34.542 --> 00:39:35.625
people should get it.

00:39:36.083 --> 00:39:37.542
Now I'll tell you how it’s working out.

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:42.250
Like the other day, I was not there but My husband saw

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:47.125
a program about a comedian who said that he gets a cool

00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:49.917
breeze – you see, he was talking about his revelation.

00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.417
He said, “Suddenly I started getting cool breeze in my

00:39:52.834 --> 00:39:56.500
back and I don't know what it is,

00:39:56.875 --> 00:40:00.875
but I felt very relaxed and so many people feel relaxed

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.917
when they sit together with me.”

00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:07.041
Now, he doesn't know anything, he's very vague about

00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:09.250
the cool breeze, but he, he felt it.

00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:11.125
That's a revelation he gives.

00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:13.959
Now just before that, a day, two days before, we were

00:40:14.417 --> 00:40:17.166
discussing amongst themselves and they said, “Mother,

00:40:17.417 --> 00:40:19.959
how many people you need to have that syndrome?”

00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:21.500
What is it called as?

00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:24.917
Hundred monkey syndrome. I hope you have heard about it,

00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:27.542
that when the hundred monkey learnt a trick,

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:30.166
every monkey everywhere started doing that trick,

00:40:30.458 --> 00:40:31.417
sort of a thing.

00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:33.709
I said, “It will be very soon."

00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:35.999
And just imagine, this fellow started feeling this

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.917
cool breeze on his back.

00:40:37.917 --> 00:40:40.458
Now he came on the television, and the television were

00:40:40.917 --> 00:40:43.250
very, very skeptical as you say – very, very.

00:40:43.667 --> 00:40:46.500
And I didn't bother much about it. I said,

00:40:46.834 --> 00:40:51.458
“The time will come by itself” – because we don’t take

00:40:51.834 --> 00:40:55.417
any money, and we cannot pay any money for any such things.

00:40:55.875 --> 00:40:59.500
Now when somebody met them and told them that this

00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:01.834
program has taken place, there's somebody who knows

00:41:02.166 --> 00:41:04.417
all about this thing, immediately they came to Me.

00:41:04.792 --> 00:41:06.166
And now they want Me to have a program.

00:41:06.583 --> 00:41:09.166
And once it starts like that, people will come round.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.792
The trouble is, you see, human beings have so much of a

00:41:12.166 --> 00:41:14.083
barrier of their ego also.

00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:16.166
They are very insensitive people.

00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:19.750
Moreover, say, a traditional country like say, Rome,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.500
Egypt, I find they are much more sensitive to divinity than

00:41:23.834 --> 00:41:25.166
to absurd things.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.750
You'll be surprised, in Rome now – we are sitting down

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.291
here, so I can tell you – in Rome no guru has been

00:41:30.625 --> 00:41:32.500
successful. No guru has been successful.

00:41:32.792 --> 00:41:35.291
But when I went there, just seeing My photograph, just

00:41:35.542 --> 00:41:38.291
seeing My photograph the mayor was so amazed.

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:40.750
He said “It's divinity” – just seeing My photograph.

00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:44.333
And he took it over, he gave us a hall free, he published it

00:41:44.667 --> 00:41:47.750
and he made so many posters, he put it all over.

00:41:48.125 --> 00:41:50.625
And it's working very well in Rome.

00:41:50.999 --> 00:41:52.500
But not in England. I have been here for ten years

00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:57.417
working hard, but English are rather hard people.

00:41:57.792 --> 00:41:59.250
Doesn't matter, it will work out.

00:41:59.709 --> 00:42:03.041
And then also in Egypt. Egypt is another place which are

00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:04.709
very traditional people.

00:42:05.083 --> 00:42:06.750
Another I have found is Greece.

00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:08.875
They are very traditional, and they – in tradition what

00:42:09.166 --> 00:42:12.166
happens, you start learning by making mistakes, you see.

00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:14.625
You believe in Rasputin, you believe in this and believe in

00:42:14.917 --> 00:42:18.500
that; and then you start understanding what is reality,

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:19.709
how we’ll get it.

00:42:19.709 --> 00:42:20.834
And that’s how they come to it.

00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:23.208
But here just people read, read, read and they reach

00:42:23.625 --> 00:42:25.250
nowhere, they are so confused.

00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:27.041
I don't blame them for all this.

00:42:27.041 --> 00:42:30.250
But I must say that they must come to terms with reality

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:33.834
and try to understand that you cannot purchase it,

00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:39.333
first of all, and you cannot work for it

00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:44.208
It is a spontaneous, living process of the living God.

00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:46.250
This is what we have to understand.

00:42:46.625 --> 00:42:49.291
And once we understand that it will work out, I'm sure.

00:42:49.625 --> 00:42:51.917
I understand that people are like that.

00:42:52.375 --> 00:42:55.041
And you'll be surprised, I've been working ten years in

00:42:55.375 --> 00:42:59.750
England and we don't have so many Sahaja yogis

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.750
as we have in other, other countries.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.959
Even France is better, surprisingly.

00:43:04.291 --> 00:43:07.542
Much better off, France, and Switzerland is much better.

00:43:07.542 --> 00:43:10.375
But England is the one that is lacking very much, and I’m

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.083
and I’m working very hard here.

00:43:12.542 --> 00:43:14.625
India of course, is thousand times more.

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.500
So it's all right, it will come.

00:43:16.792 --> 00:43:18.917
English are that way very balanced – sometimes over-

00:43:19.208 --> 00:43:21.417
balanced, you see!

00:43:23.792 --> 00:43:25.000
One thing good about them, they know

00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:26.999
how to laugh at themselves.

00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:29.125
So it may work out.

00:43:32.834 --> 00:43:36.542
[Audience question repeated by a yogi:

00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:48.250
She says that You said that the gurus often do more harm

00:43:48.834 --> 00:43:52.291
than good. How do we know that You may not be doing

00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:53.625
more harm than good?]

00:43:53.999 --> 00:43:56.000
Yes, of course, may be, I may be doing, no doubt; you

00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:57.542
must keep that open.

00:43:57.917 --> 00:43:59.959
But you can talk to people who are …

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.500
Always, when you go to a guru – actually I've seen when

00:44:02.917 --> 00:44:04.750
you come to Me, you ask Me questions,

00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:07.375
but when you go to these people you go headlong,

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.959
absolutely headlong.

00:44:09.417 --> 00:44:11.500
I've known people who paid six thousand pounds to go to

00:44:11.792 --> 00:44:16.542
Switzerland and eat only potato, water of the potato that

00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:17.709
is boiled.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.583
And they lived there without asking a question.

00:44:20.917 --> 00:44:22.999
That is one of the signs that you are free.

00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:27.625
Secondly, you must know that what others have been,

00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:32.333
others have been to Me, what has happened to them.

00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:35.375
Thirdly, you should know, why should I harm you?

00:44:35.709 --> 00:44:37.041
What is My advantage?

00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:39.041
Because I don't take any money from you,

00:44:39.375 --> 00:44:40.208
nothing of the kind.

00:44:40.583 --> 00:44:42.417
By God's grace, I'm living very well in My life.

00:44:42.709 --> 00:44:45.333
Perhaps I'm very well-off in life, I don't need anything

00:44:45.667 --> 00:44:48.041
from anyone, so why should I do it?

00:44:48.458 --> 00:44:52.208
On another life where I am, I'm at a very high level,

00:44:52.583 --> 00:44:54.417
so, why should I come to you?

00:44:54.709 --> 00:44:59.166
For what? What am I going to gain out of you?

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.291
So credibility must be established through the disciples.

00:45:02.625 --> 00:45:03.875
You never see the disciples.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.333
You just go headlong because you are mesmerized.

00:45:06.333 --> 00:45:07.792
You don't even think about it.

00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:09.792
You don't even ask questions. I asked them,

00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:10.917
“Why didn't you ask questions,

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.917
why are you taking six thousand pounds?”

00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:16.083
“Oh,” they said, “Mother, we were walking under the blanket.”

00:45:16.458 --> 00:45:19.375
And the person who was the head of that organization in

00:45:19.792 --> 00:45:22.834
Scotland became epileptic, his daughter became

00:45:23.083 --> 00:45:25.999
epileptic, his wife became epileptic, and he was – he

00:45:26.291 --> 00:45:28.667
then, then he came to Me.

00:45:28.999 --> 00:45:31.667
Then he came to Me in that state and I took him,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.709
them in My house to cure them.

00:45:36.709 --> 00:45:38.875
So those people who have been to Me,

00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:41.917
like Dr. Warren has been: now he was a patient of high

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.291
blood pressure, all kinds of things, he got cured – not

00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:45.917
only, he's cured many people.

00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:48.500
And there are so many here who have been helped.

00:45:48.875 --> 00:45:51.500
People who used to, were alcoholics, drug addicts, this,

00:45:51.834 --> 00:45:53.291
all of them have become all right.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.709
So you must see them and see how they are, and you

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.959
can see how they talk, how they know.

00:45:59.333 --> 00:46:03.041
But in any other guru's place, they – it’s such a hierarchy

00:46:03.417 --> 00:46:05.125
you cannot even reach them.

00:46:05.542 --> 00:46:07.208
And somebody who talks is, remembers everything by

00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:10.417
heart and says something, there's nothing spontaneous,

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.667
nothing; they don't know anything about it.

00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:15.959
So credibility must be established first of all.

00:46:16.333 --> 00:46:18.834
But that you don't do with anybody else, only with Me.

00:46:19.041 --> 00:46:24.583
That's a good sign for Me, that I give you freedom.

00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:40.166
She says that surely all paths lead to Rome.

00:46:40.709 --> 00:46:44.250
You were speaking about the Dalai Lama, and so what's wrong?

00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:48.291
No, but some lead to hell also. We must know.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.834
Every doesn't go to Rome, but can go to hell also.

00:46:52.166 --> 00:46:56.375
Of course, all paths lead to Rome if the person who takes

00:46:56.709 --> 00:47:00.834
you there is a right guide, is the right guide.

00:47:01.208 --> 00:47:04.999
You cannot go to hell and then, say, come back to Rome.

00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:07.041
You cannot.

00:47:07.375 --> 00:47:09.959
But the people who are right guides can do it.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.500
They don't take any money, they don't do.

00:47:12.875 --> 00:47:14.166
They give you realization.

00:47:14.542 --> 00:47:15.875
They make you something different.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.542
They make you righteous, virtuous and great people.

00:47:19.959 --> 00:47:23.291
It's a very different thing: are not those who just profess

00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:25.500
something, or say something.

00:47:25.875 --> 00:47:27.625
They do not accumulate wealth.

00:47:27.625 --> 00:47:28.875
You see, they are self-respecting people,

00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:30.125
they are not parasites.

00:47:30.458 --> 00:47:33.166
They don't live on your living.

00:47:34.375 --> 00:47:36.041
How much did Christ earn?

00:47:36.417 --> 00:47:38.542
You have such a great example of Christ.

00:47:38.917 --> 00:47:40.792
Why do you go to anybody else?

00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:43.041
Did He take any money?

00:47:43.417 --> 00:47:46.208
He was sold for thirty rupees.

00:47:49.125 --> 00:47:51.999
What Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:54.709
I would like to know what Christians are there, which

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.208
Christians have those eyes which are not adulterous.

00:47:59.542 --> 00:48:01.458
Have you got innocent eyes?

00:48:01.917 --> 00:48:03.667
There’s no lust and greed in your eyes?

00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:05.500
Face yourself.

00:48:06.166 --> 00:48:09.166
Those who talk of these things have all those, much

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.166
greater sins than what you have.

00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:14.417
How can they improve you?

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:16.917
They are the ones who are living on others' property,

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:18.250
others' money.

00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:21.125
Will you live on somebody else's property and earnings?

00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:23.625
They are making the children to get out of their houses,

00:48:23.917 --> 00:48:25.375
sell their houses, go on the streets.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.125
Will you do that? For anyone?

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.333
Taking money from the poor, will you do that?

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:34.250
You are so good! Must understand.

00:48:34.583 --> 00:48:37.625
Use your brains.

00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:42.208
But when you get realization,

00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:44.458
you develop those innocent eyes.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.999
The eyes are so powerful.

00:48:45.999 --> 00:48:47.834
Even looking at somebody with those eyes,

00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:51.125
you can give realization.

00:48:51.583 --> 00:48:52.667
You can cure them.

00:48:53.083 --> 00:48:56.542
Like the other day we had one – what was his name,

00:48:57.417 --> 00:48:59.166
the one who came to …?

00:48:59.667 --> 00:49:02.500
One journalist, you see, who came and who said that

00:49:02.959 --> 00:49:04.834
“It is said that You can cure people.”

00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:06.000
I said, “All right.”

00:49:06.375 --> 00:49:08.166
So he said, “There's one lady who's suffering from the

00:49:08.458 --> 00:49:12.375
disease of agoraphobia, and she doesn't want to come

00:49:12.667 --> 00:49:14.959
out of her house, so how will You cure her?”

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.917
I said, “All right, if she cannot come, get Me her

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:18.999
photograph; I can't go to her house” – sort of challenging

00:49:19.333 --> 00:49:22.959
Me. I said, “All right, bring her photograph to Me.”

00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:24.417
He brought a photograph to Me.

00:49:24.417 --> 00:49:25.999
I just looked at the photograph.

00:49:26.375 --> 00:49:28.458
“She's like this for ten years,” he said; and he said,

00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:30.625
“You must cure her.” I said, “All right, I'll try.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.041
It's very easy to cure this disease at least.”

00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:37.500
And I said, “You just leave her alone for eight days.”

00:49:37.834 --> 00:49:42.083
But he couldn't, you see, resist, so he went like a C.I.D.

00:49:42.458 --> 00:49:44.625
there to find out what was going on.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And when he went to her house she was not there.

00:49:47.458 --> 00:49:49.375
She was out on the move with her husband,

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:50.500
having a nice stroll.

00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:55.417
And he's now going to publish a very good article about it.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.959
Question: Do You see Yourself as a spiritual healer?

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.917
No, not at all. Not a healer.

00:50:08.208 --> 00:50:09.166
I'm not a healer at all.

00:50:09.625 --> 00:50:12.333
I am a person who wants to give you Self-realization.

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:14.041
It's not question of spiritual healing.

00:50:14.458 --> 00:50:16.500
Spiritual healing are also two types:

00:50:16.875 --> 00:50:20.000
one of them is of course the people who are realized souls.

00:50:20.375 --> 00:50:22.542
Like the other day we went – of course, we met somebody.

00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:28.000
(Where was that, a taxi fellow who came with us?)

00:50:28.375 --> 00:50:29.375
[Yogi: In Nottingham.]

00:50:29.875 --> 00:50:32.834
Aah. The taxi gentleman who came in the car thing,

00:50:33.125 --> 00:50:35.041
I knew he was a realized soul.

00:50:35.417 --> 00:50:36.500
So he just started talking to Me.

00:50:36.917 --> 00:50:38.417
He also felt that nearness.

00:50:38.792 --> 00:50:40.667
And I said, “Do your fingers tingle sometimes?"

00:50:40.959 --> 00:50:42.625
He said, “Yes, very much."

00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:44.041
I said, “Are you a healer?"

00:50:44.417 --> 00:50:45.542
“Yes,” he said, “I'm a healer.”

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:46.834
He said, “How do you know all about it?"

00:50:47.208 --> 00:50:49.875
I said, “Do you feel very guilty?" “Yes.”

00:50:50.208 --> 00:50:51.250
“Oh,” I said, “I know that."

00:50:51.583 --> 00:50:52.291
He said, “How do you know?"

00:50:52.667 --> 00:50:53.999
I said, “I know somehow.

00:50:54.208 --> 00:50:55.458
But you want to know about it.”

00:50:55.834 --> 00:50:57.291
Because he was a realized soul.

00:50:57.542 --> 00:50:58.333
He was a realized soul.

00:50:58.709 --> 00:51:00.583
But there are healers who are not realized souls.

00:51:00.875 --> 00:51:02.583
They are the people who use spirits.

00:51:02.875 --> 00:51:04.208
They shake before you and shout and –

00:51:04.458 --> 00:51:08.166
that's very dangerous.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:10.375
A realized soul doesn't have to do anything.

00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:12.792
Only touches you, you’ll be all right.

00:51:13.083 --> 00:51:16.709
He doesn't have to shake and do all these tantrums.

00:51:17.333 --> 00:51:19.583
Because you are so naive, I must say,

00:51:19.959 --> 00:51:22.917
that's why there is such a problem. Very naive.

00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:25.542
In the West we have developed our tree very well,

00:51:25.959 --> 00:51:26.500
but not the roots.

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.166
We don't know anything about the roots.

00:51:28.667 --> 00:51:32.709
I was amazed Myself, because there's no idea at all.

00:51:33.125 --> 00:51:35.917
Not in India – India people know this.

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:37.041
They know this.

00:51:37.458 --> 00:51:39.333
Like we put dead in the church.

00:51:39.625 --> 00:51:41.208
In India nobody would put dead in the church –

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.834
it's a, is a holy place, how do you put the dead there?

00:51:45.125 --> 00:51:46.208
But this is what it is.

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:49.166
You are naive, I know, and despite that, that naivety,

00:51:49.542 --> 00:51:51.041
you are also very adamant.

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.208
Though what to do now:

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.375
it's a difficult question sometimes for Me.

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:58.041
Doesn't matter. It works out. Yes?

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:03.834
[Inaudible question.] What say?

00:52:07.583 --> 00:52:09.291
[Yogi repeats: Could You explain what You mean by this

00:52:09.709 --> 00:52:11.709
energy rising through the spine?

00:52:12.208 --> 00:52:14.667
And isn't it just really the same thing as a tingling up the

00:52:14.959 --> 00:52:17.375
spine, perhaps…(addressed to questioner:

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.917
Do you mean of a more physical kind?)]

00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:24.041
[Questioner: A feeling of awe.]

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.458
Yes. Feeling of …. Awe?

00:52:26.834 --> 00:52:29.291
[Yogi: Yes, he's relating the feeling that you might have

00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:32.375
up your spine to a feeling of awe, and perhaps saying it’s

00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:35.417
There is not, no – I have not known such a thing as that.  I

00:52:35.917 --> 00:52:36.834
don't know.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:38.667
That’s a – it doesn't happen like that.

00:52:39.083 --> 00:52:41.250
You see, when the Kundalini rises you don't feel anything,

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:42.750
nothing of the kind.

00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:46.083
Only thing you feel at top of your head a cool breeze.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.250
All right? And in the hands you feel a kind of a cool

00:52:49.542 --> 00:52:50.709
breeze coming out.

00:52:51.125 --> 00:52:52.999
But in the beginning you might feel little heat,

00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:54.999
because if you have too much heat in the body,

00:52:55.375 --> 00:52:57.291
then you might feel a little heat coming out.

00:52:57.709 --> 00:53:00.750
Sometimes people who are very nervous type shake a

00:53:00.999 --> 00:53:02.166
little, that's all.

00:53:02.458 --> 00:53:04.417
But this thing I have never known, is some sort of a funny

00:53:04.709 --> 00:53:07.709
thing maybe coming from somewhere – I don't know.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.667
All kinds of  permutations and combinations I’ve seen

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
happening to people.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.667
Like one gentleman, he sat on the ground with the feet

00:53:15.041 --> 00:53:16.750
with the feet towards Me – in India is not done.

00:53:17.041 --> 00:53:18.500
So people said that “How can you put your feet

00:53:18.875 --> 00:53:20.166
towards Mother? It is not done.”

00:53:20.625 --> 00:53:21.959
So he said, “No, my Kundalini's awakened

00:53:22.375 --> 00:53:24.458
and I'll jump like a frog.”

00:53:24.834 --> 00:53:25.583
I said, “Who told you?"

00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:28.000
He showed Me a book of his guru, written down that you

00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:29.834
jump like a frog. Can you imagine?

00:53:30.208 --> 00:53:34.000
I asked him, “Will you, are you going to become a frog now?"

00:53:34.333 --> 00:53:36.041
All kinds of permutations and combinations:

00:53:36.417 --> 00:53:39.583
you don't know how many things are there published

00:53:39.875 --> 00:53:41.625
all over the world.

00:53:44.875 --> 00:53:47.041
[Yogi: Right, he wants to know how is this awakening

00:53:47.375 --> 00:53:50.375
initiated – the awakening of the Kundalini.]

00:53:50.709 --> 00:53:53.333
It’s very simple as I told you, just like sprouting of the

00:53:53.667 --> 00:53:55.125
seed. That's My job.

00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:58.917
But then once I have done it, you have to do it also.

00:53:59.208 --> 00:54:01.583
All right? On that promise.

00:54:03.667 --> 00:54:05.750
[Question: You say that false gurus and teachers can lead

00:54:06.125 --> 00:54:09.375
maybe to hell. Can You define hell?]

00:54:09.792 --> 00:54:13.375
Now, at this good time, why do you want to know hell?

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.999
You see, it is described very well if you read any one of

00:54:17.375 --> 00:54:18.583
these great poets.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.792
Specially I would say, read William Blake. All right?

00:54:23.125 --> 00:54:25.291
It's already described so much, why do you want?

00:54:25.792 --> 00:54:28.208
I want, I want you to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:54:28.625 --> 00:54:32.166
Hell is, when I'm saying “to hell”: you might get epilepsy.

00:54:32.875 --> 00:54:36.125
Now I've seen people getting epilepsy, people getting

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.208
lunatic, leaving their homes, running away, hitting

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:44.250
everyone, killing each other, killing themselves, killing

00:54:44.583 --> 00:54:50.417
their parents, violent, they take to drugs, take to all kinds

00:54:50.709 --> 00:54:52.834
of things which are self-destructive.

00:54:53.125 --> 00:54:57.500
What I mean is “self-destructive”, in one word. All right?

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:04.792
[Question: What about people who suffer from these

00:55:05.125 --> 00:55:06.125
things from birth?]

00:55:06.917 --> 00:55:10.041
Yes. All right. If they suffer from this, there is something

00:55:10.417 --> 00:55:11.709
else is responsible.

00:55:12.083 --> 00:55:13.208
But they do suffer, isn't it?

00:55:13.542 --> 00:55:16.041
But those who have not suffered and are normal and go

00:55:16.417 --> 00:55:18.625
to these gurus, pay money and get it, then at least you

00:55:18.917 --> 00:55:23.709
will hold these great gurus responsible, or not?

00:55:29.583 --> 00:55:31.583
What is it?

00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:34.959
[Question: Do you feel there are not any other gurus who

00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:37.208
Oh, many! There are many. But they are not in the

00:55:37.583 --> 00:55:40.375
market. There are many, many more.

00:55:40.792 --> 00:55:43.834
Many there ... beg pardon?

00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:46.375
[Yogi: Are there any who can be beneficial to you?]

00:55:46.709 --> 00:55:50.917
Beneficial to you? To anyone? Yes, they are.

00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:54.125
But just see now, in this crowd I'm talking to you, you're

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:55.667
asking ten questions.

00:55:56.083 --> 00:55:57.625
They have no patience.

00:55:58.083 --> 00:55:59.750
They have no patience at all. I tell you, they are so

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:04.375
impatient, all these gurus, that you have no idea.

00:56:04.792 --> 00:56:08.625
They just can't bear it. I asked one gentleman to go to

00:56:08.917 --> 00:56:11.750
America, with great coaxing and everything, because

00:56:12.125 --> 00:56:13.625
I had no time to go there.

00:56:13.959 --> 00:56:15.500
Within three days he ran away from there.

00:56:15.917 --> 00:56:18.417
He said, “I have no time for these stupid people."

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.291
Just he cancelled it, you see.

00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:23.417
Because I'm a Mother, I have patience for you.

00:56:23.917 --> 00:56:26.000
They have no patience for you. What am I to do?

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.208
They are telling Me, “After twelve years we'll come and

00:56:28.542 --> 00:56:30.667
help you, Mother.” They know Me very well.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.208
They are so many, so many.

00:56:32.625 --> 00:56:34.875
They have met some, but they don't want to talk to people

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:37.999
who are – they think they are stupid.

00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:38.999
What to do, now?

00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:41.333
They think all seekers are stupid people.

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:44.041
What am I to do? They have no patience.

00:56:44.375 --> 00:56:48.000
You have to have a Mother to have patience, isn't it?

00:56:52.333 --> 00:56:54.583
Now. There's no end to it, my child.

00:56:54.959 --> 00:56:56.750
These questions have no meaning.

00:56:57.083 --> 00:56:59.542
By asking questions you are not going to get realization,

00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:01.125
I must tell you.

00:57:01.625 --> 00:57:03.875
I cannot guarantee it. I cannot guarantee it.

00:57:04.375 --> 00:57:06.667
If you get it, it's your luck.

00:57:06.999 --> 00:57:09.917
If you don't get it, it's your luck. So be careful.

00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:13.333
There's no need to discuss, argue; by argument you are

00:57:13.667 --> 00:57:16.041
not going to get it. Listen to Me.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.125
What am I going to gain out of you?

00:57:18.542 --> 00:57:20.792
This is the first place where we have so many questions.

00:57:21.208 --> 00:57:24.375
Must be some Romans are around here, I think, reborn.

00:57:24.709 --> 00:57:27.291
Otherwise I can't explain. I mean, nobody asked so many

00:57:27.625 --> 00:57:29.834
questions as you have asked Me which has no meaning.

00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:32.792
And supporting the, these fake gurus who have taken

00:57:33.125 --> 00:57:35.999
money from you, have disturbed so many people;

00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:39.125
supporting satanic forces.

00:57:39.542 --> 00:57:41.917
Something surprising, isn't it?

00:57:42.208 --> 00:57:43.542
All right, doesn't matter.

00:57:43.917 --> 00:57:47.250
Now, I have already told that I'm – now, that's all.

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:48.792
If you want Me to come back to Bath,

00:57:49.083 --> 00:57:51.250
please, no more questions now.

00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:53.417
But we'll see how many get realization here.

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:55.667
That's the main point.

00:57:56.917 --> 00:57:58.250
Main point is not …

00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:02.709
You are going to be judged by your Kundalini – let's see.

00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:05.917
Before you judge Me, she's going to judge you.

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.041
So let's see how many of you get realization.

00:58:08.375 --> 00:58:09.625
I cannot promise you.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.709
That's the main thing, I must tell you.

00:58:13.542 --> 00:58:15.959
All right. Let's see how it works out.

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:18.542
Now whatever I have said, forget it.

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:22.458
Let's have a pleasant relationship.

00:58:22.834 --> 00:58:25.583
That is, you are not to feel any guilty about anything,

00:58:25.875 --> 00:58:26.709
whatever I have said.

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:28.583
You might have been to guru, you might have done

00:58:28.959 --> 00:58:31.250
anything that’s supposed to be wrong – all right.

00:58:31.625 --> 00:58:35.208
Just forget it. Just now you sit in the present.

00:58:35.583 --> 00:58:39.583
You have to be in the present to get your realization –

00:58:39.999 --> 00:58:41.250
that's the most important thing.

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.500
You are born on this earth to be that,

00:58:43.917 --> 00:58:45.792
you are a human being to be that.

00:58:46.208 --> 00:58:48.250
You are not here just to waste your life.

00:58:48.667 --> 00:58:50.291
And that's what I have to tell you as a Mother,

00:58:50.792 --> 00:58:54.083
that you have to be humble about it.

00:58:54.458 --> 00:58:58.166
It's a very different realm you are in.

00:58:58.792 --> 00:59:01.667
It is nothing is selling here, it's not a shop.

00:59:02.083 --> 00:59:03.709
And here, it's a temple.

00:59:04.166 --> 00:59:06.917
And in a temple you have to be humble, and you have to

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:10.166
get your realization: that should be your determination.

00:59:10.583 --> 00:59:13.041
But how many will get, that I cannot say.

00:59:13.709 --> 00:59:17.291
I'm sorry, but it's not a thing that I can promise all of you.

00:59:17.667 --> 00:59:20.625
But if it works out on some, I’ll be very satisfied.

00:59:20.999 --> 00:59:22.458
That's My job is.

00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:25.458
Now let's have very simple things, without asking any

00:59:25.792 --> 00:59:27.000
more questions.

00:59:27.458 --> 00:59:30.333
Now there's no need to be disturbed about it.

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:32.667
If you have not asked one question, nothing goes wrong

00:59:33.041 --> 00:59:35.000
with you or with audience.

00:59:35.375 --> 00:59:37.375
I tell you, even if you ask hundred questions it's not going

00:59:37.709 --> 00:59:39.375
to make any difference.

00:59:39.792 --> 00:59:42.375
I must say, so far nobody has asked anything

00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:45.959
that is intelligent, and I think you'd better now give up

00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:47.542
asking questions.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.166
I’m bit too intelligent for that.

00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:54.417
Now, let's have it the way it has to work out.

00:59:54.834 --> 00:59:56.999
Let's have it the way it has to work out.

00:59:57.375 --> 01:00:01.542
If you are seekers and if you are in the present,

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.333
I'm sure you will get it.

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:05.999
Now forget the past. Forget the past.

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:09.000
One more thing I have to request, as I requested

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:12.959
yesterday, that you are not to feel guilty about anything,

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.999
because guilt comes from the past.

01:00:14.999 --> 01:00:17.999
So forget the past and you have to assert

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.291
that you are not guilty.

01:00:19.875 --> 01:00:21.834
There are many people who are good, and they'll get it.

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:26.000
So you have to assert that “I'm not guilty."

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:29.166
Now, you have to call Me as Shri Mataji when you

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:30.875
address, which is difficult.

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:33.417
You can call Me Mother, to make it simpler – whichever

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:34.834
way you like.

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:37.834
So you have to say “Mother, I'm not guilty,” just before

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.166
starting this process.

01:00:40.667 --> 01:00:42.959
Now, we have to humble down in our hearts, because we

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:45.667
want to enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:49.750
But the one who is trying to do it, if you are all the time

01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:52.583
attacking that person, how will you go?

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:53.875
How will you enter in?

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.959
Just look at that. What is our attitude?

01:00:56.458 --> 01:01:00.500
Is it proper? It's not being fair, not just.

01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:06.583
All right. So we take out our shoes just to take help

01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:07.792
from the Mother Earth.

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:10.709
One of the very important elements is the Mother Earth.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:13.959
And this Kundalini is based in the sacrum bone, and the

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:17.291
lower chakras are made from the element of Mother Earth.

01:01:17.792 --> 01:01:20.542
So just take out your shoes, very easily, to touch the

01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:22.500
Mother Earth with your feet.

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:25.291
This Mother Earth is very important.

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:29.625
[Yogi: Anyone who doesn't want the experience, please,

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:31.959
you should leave now, anyone who doesn’t want …]

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.291
Leave. Don't disturb others. You be kind.

01:01:34.709 --> 01:01:36.999
You have to be civil. You have to be civil people.

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:38.875
Don't disturb others.

01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:40.709
If you don't want to have, well and good.

01:01:41.166 --> 01:01:43.792
It's all right; you can go.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.750
Those who were yesterday in Bristol know

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:58.417
how much I have worked hard on so many people

01:01:58.959 --> 01:02:01.250
for hours together to give them realization.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:04.583
And it's a thankless job. I tell you, it's a thankless job;

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:06.875
because unless and until you establish yourself, it's such

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:10.291
a waste, I feel, it’s a tremendous waste.

01:02:10.834 --> 01:02:13.542
Is just good for nothing, because you give them

01:02:13.875 --> 01:02:15.667
realization, they do not establish themselves

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:18.959
and it's just such a waste.

01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:22.917
Now, age does not matter, race does not matter,

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.750
community does not matter.

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:29.333
As long as you are a human being, it works out –

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:31.375
is as simple as that.

01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:35.125
So now you just have to put your hands straight on your

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:39.999
lap, without feeling any discomfort while you are sitting.

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:43.000
That's important, because I do not want that your,

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.375
you should feel uncomfortable, and by that you start

01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:48.959
moving about.

01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:51.125
Now, you have to take out your shoes, please, because

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.333
as it is Tibetan problems are there.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.542
If you want to have realization, take out your shoes,

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:59.417
all right? Yes, just take them out. It's better.

01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:02.542
Socks, yes. Will be better because I want to work on you,

01:03:02.834 --> 01:03:04.458
definitely you are a seeker, all right?

01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:08.250
Put your hands like this. Yes.

01:03:09.834 --> 01:03:10.750
Hmm. Starting. Now.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.417
Despite everything, it's good. It's not so bad.

01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:24.000
Now, this left hand, as I told you, represents the left side,

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:27.750
the emotional side; and the right side is the hand that

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:30.000
represents the action.

01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:33.917
Now this is the desire that we have, the desire.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:37.834
So to put the desire hand on the left-hand side like this,

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:42.999
straight all the time, when we have this process of giving

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:45.583
relaxation to your chakras.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.417
Because some of the chakras are in augmented state and

01:03:49.834 --> 01:03:50.917
they are to be relaxed.

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:53.917
You can do it yourself, and how you will do it I'll just tell you.

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:56.208
There are, on the left-hand side

01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:58.041
we'll be touching those centers.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.583
Now one is in the heart where resides the spirit.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.917
Then one is in the upper part of the abdomen.

01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:08.875
And then another one in the lower part of the abdomen –

01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:11.375
all of them are on the left-hand side.

01:04:11.875 --> 01:04:14.041
Now, then one is here.

01:04:14.709 --> 01:04:17.208
This is the one you catch when you feel guilty.

01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:22.208
Like this, here, on the left-hand side of your neck.

01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:26.083
And then another one is here, and maybe here we may

01:04:26.417 --> 01:04:27.458
have to ask.

01:04:27.999 --> 01:04:30.750
And then you come up here on the fontanel bone area,

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:34.291
where I'll ask you to put the palm on top of your fontanel

01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:35.917
bone area.

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:38.208
Just now it's hot, but it will be all right. Let's do it.

01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:40.083
Now, it's very simple.

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:42.667
You have to keep your eyes shut throughout, because

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.625
there's no mesmerism, nothing like that.

01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:46.458
It has to happen within yourself.

01:04:46.834 --> 01:04:48.709
The attention is sucked in, and it's better to keep your

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.333
eyes shut, because if your eyes are open the Kundalini

01:04:51.667 --> 01:04:52.875
may not rise.

01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:55.625
And it doesn't trouble you, it doesn't give you any problem

01:04:56.083 --> 01:04:59.375
– nothing of the kind; and you feel extremely relaxed,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.750
and you feel fine.

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:05.041
All right. So now we close our eyes.

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:10.667
First of all, please do not feel guilty for anything, even for

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.041
asking questions or anything, don't feel guilty.

01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:17.250
Whatever I have said, just forget it.

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:19.000
Be kind to yourself.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:22.208
Be very kind to yourself.

01:05:22.583 --> 01:05:24.917
And you have to respect yourself.

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:32.250
Now, at this stage put your right hand on your heart,

01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:34.000
on the left-hand side.

01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:35.959
Left-hand side is the heart,

01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:39.291
so put your right hand on the heart.

01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:45.125
Now keep your eyes shut, and try to look within your

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.709
heart, in the sense, put your attention to your heart and

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:53.208
say – you have to ask now, Me, a real question which is

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.125
the intelligent question.

01:05:55.542 --> 01:06:00.333
Ask a question, “Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:06.583
Ask this question three times, “Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:06:06.959 --> 01:06:11.917
Ask this question three times, “Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:06:19.834 --> 01:06:23.458
(Left is too much, it’s left … Hm.)

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:36.250
Now, raise this hand – I mean, lower this hand on the

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:41.500
abdomen, on the upper part on the left-hand side.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.792
Lower this hand on the left-hand side, on the upper part of

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.500
your stomach.

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:54.041
Here is another center, the center of the Primordial Master.

01:06:55.041 --> 01:06:58.792
As you become, you become the spirit, you become the

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:01.333
master, you become the guru.

01:07:01.999 --> 01:07:05.208
So now logically you have to ask another question,

01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:07.917
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:11.709
Ask a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.999
Ask the question three times.

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:16.625
That's a sensible question.

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:19.625
You are your own master, you don’t need any master

01:07:19.999 --> 01:07:20.959
whatsoever.

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:25.834
I'm not your master, I'm just your Mother, that's all.

01:07:40.417 --> 01:07:43.542
Now. After asking this question you lower your hand

01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:46.834
again, on the lower part of your abdomen.

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:49.125
And this is a very important center which is called as

01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:53.500
Swadisthan, which looks after the aortic plexus in our being.

01:07:54.999 --> 01:08:03.041
Now, press the fingers in and say at this point – because

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:09.083
at this point, I must confess, I cannot cross your freedom.

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:14.000
You are free to choose. If you want to have the true

01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:18.750
knowledge, you have to ask for it, I cannot force on you.

01:08:19.208 --> 01:08:21.500
So you have to say, “Mother, please give me true

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:25.000
knowledge, give me pure knowledge. I want pure

01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:29.834
knowledge, the technique of pure knowledge” which is the

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:35.999
another meaning of the word “yoga.”

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:40.500
You have to say this six times because there are six

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:43.250
petals to this center.

01:08:43.792 --> 01:08:48.333
There are six also plexuses, sub-plexuses to the aortic plexus.

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:58.333
(Terrible! Left Swadisthan.)

01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:05.208
Hm – now.

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:26.417
Again you are feeling guilty.

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:28.000
Please don't feel guilty.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.875
Please don't feel guilty.

01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:31.500
Don't feel guilty for anything.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:35.917
You have done nothing wrong. (Ah, now better.)

01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:41.917
Now raise this hand again to the upper part of your

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:48.000
stomach, where the center of the Primordial Master is.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:54.417
As you have asked for the technique, I will tell you, you

01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:58.208
have to at this center assert, to say,

01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:04.917
“I am my own master.” Just say that.

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:09.500
You have to say ten times with full confidence,

01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:13.083
say, “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.709
Because there are ten sub-plexuses, like ten valencies,

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:19.041
we have these ten plexuses.

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:31.917
Aah! Forget your masters.

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:35.333
And forget all the slavery.

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:45.583
Hah! All right. (All right. Good.) Ten times.

01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:51.792
All right. Good. Ten times.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:09.583
Now, raise this right hand to your heart, again to your

01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:14.166
heart. Here resides your spirit.

01:11:14.667 --> 01:11:17.542
Again in the technique, you assert –

01:11:17.959 --> 01:11:21.166
this is the mantra you have to say at this point,

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:25.999
“Mother, I am the spirit."

01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:32.709
In all humility, in all your glory you accept, assume.

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:37.291
“Mother, I am the spirit."

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.792
(It’s good, very good.)

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:04.792
You have to say this twelve times.

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:06.999
But don't feel guilty.

01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:13.291
Now I have to tell you that God is the ocean of love.

01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:17.333
He's the ocean of compassion.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:22.709
But best of all, He is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:12:23.166 --> 01:12:26.375
So please don't feel guilty, because what sin can you

01:12:26.792 --> 01:12:30.834
commit that He cannot forgive?

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:33.917
We are challenging His power of forgiveness

01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:35.250
when we feel guilty.

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:38.375
Please don't feel guilty.

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:45.458
Without feeling guilty, say “Mother, I am the spirit.”

01:12:46.375 --> 01:12:51.250
(Come down. All right. Ah, it’s better.)

01:12:58.125 --> 01:13:03.999
Twelve times, because there are twelve petals.

01:13:05.667 --> 01:13:09.041
(Left Nabhi. It’s more on the left, it’s all right.

01:13:09.458 --> 01:13:16.667
There’s nothing on the right. Ah!

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:31.792
Better. But left Nabhi is too much.

01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:35.542
It moves from here.)

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:51.375
Now, move this hand upward and put it, the right hand –

01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.000
you have to move the right hand, left hand towards Me –

01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:58.000
put it on the left-hand side of your neck.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:01.667
At the base, touching almost the left side of your spinal

01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:05.917
cord and pressing it a little with it.

01:14:06.417 --> 01:14:09.875
At this point, from the front – you have to do it, take the

01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:13.583
hand from the front, not from the back but from the front

01:14:13.959 --> 01:14:18.333
side – hold it tight.

01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:24.041
Here now you have to say, with full confidence, with all

01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:31.041
love and understanding about yourself,

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.375
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:37.208
Please say that, sixteen times.

01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:40.458
And if you are too much of it, you'd better say it hundred-

01:14:40.917 --> 01:14:44.959
and-eight times to punish yourself,

01:14:44.959 --> 01:14:49.917
if you are too indulgent in that kind of a thing!

01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:09.291
(It’s good. It’s rising up to the Agnya. Ah!)

01:15:31.333 --> 01:15:36.166
Now raise this hand on top, on top of your forehead

01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:38.000
across.

01:15:38.583 --> 01:15:40.875
And hold it, your forehead.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:44.166
At this point  – you know, as I told you, is the center of

01:15:44.542 --> 01:15:49.834
Christ – you have to forgive everyone.

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.250
Some people might say, “It's very difficult, Mother, how

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:53.709
can we forgive?”

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.333
But it's a myth that you do not forgive anyone or you

01:15:57.667 --> 01:16:01.792
forgive anyone, because when you do not forgive,

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:04.375
you suffer, not the other.

01:16:04.834 --> 01:16:08.792
So please say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:13.709
You'll be surprised, when you say that from your heart,

01:16:14.417 --> 01:16:17.208
this center will open out.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:36.500
Better.

01:16:39.834 --> 01:16:43.667
Now, if you are still feeling guilty, it's better that you put

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.959
your hand at the back of your head.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.959
Hold it tight – all of you should do it – and once for all say,

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:54.000
“Oh Lord, forgive me if I have done any mistakes.”

01:16:54.417 --> 01:16:58.125
Just once for all; but don't feel guilty after saying that,

01:16:58.542 --> 01:17:00.083
or not before also.

01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:04.208
Just say that “Oh Lord, forgive me if I have said anything

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:10.709
wrong or if I have done anything wrong against You.”

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:13.834
Hold your back, back of your head.

01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:21.500
Back of your head – as they call it, the optic lobe.

01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:26.000
Three times.

01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:29.083
But don't feel guilty. Please don't feel guilty.

01:17:30.834 --> 01:17:33.542
That's very important.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:40.667
(Go to the guilt again. All better. Hm – rising.)

01:17:43.834 --> 01:17:47.959
Say from your heart that “if I have done anything wrong” –

01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:50.959
now don't count that, just say it in general.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.166
Don't count what you have done wrong,

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:55.458
whatever you have done wrong. Please don't count.

01:17:55.959 --> 01:17:59.083
Just say, “If I have done anything wrong, please forgive me.

01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:01.417
That's all.

01:18:06.083 --> 01:18:08.542
Because you are the spirit; and if you are the spirit, what

01:18:08.959 --> 01:18:09.875
wrong can you do?

01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:11.709
You have to just become the spirit, that's all.

01:18:12.166 --> 01:18:17.917
You come out of the mud like a lotus.

01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:20.500
(Hah!)

01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:32.166
Now, put this hand on top of your head on the fontanel

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.583
bone area which was soft in the childhood,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.542
which is called as taloo.

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:41.875
Now press it with your palm and move your scalp.

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:47.917
At this point again – the another part of yoga – I cannot

01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:53.208
cross your freedom, because you have to ascend

01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:55.583
in your own freedom and glory.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:59.750
So you have to say that you want your realization,

01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:04.291
and that I should give you that realization.

01:19:04.917 --> 01:19:07.500
So you have say, “Mother, I want my realization.

01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:09.125
Please give me realization.”

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:11.999
And that you have to say seven times because there are

01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:17.125
seven centers, the seat of seven centers, in the brain.

01:19:18.041 --> 01:19:21.917
Now. And push it hard and move it clockwise.

01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:27.417
Push that part hard and – with your palm.

01:19:43.792 --> 01:19:48.375
Now put down your hand, please, down below.

01:19:50.667 --> 01:19:52.333
And lift your left hand, and see

01:19:52.792 --> 01:19:55.750
if there's a cool breeze coming out.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.750
Move it up and down.

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:04.250
Pay attention there.

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:08.792
About four inches or five inches there

01:20:09.166 --> 01:20:11.542
– just move it up and down.

01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.709
Now put the another hand.

01:20:19.166 --> 01:20:21.917
Now see with that hand.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.166
On top of your head.

01:20:32.125 --> 01:20:35.291
(It’s all … Because so many Sahaja yogis are sitting

01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:40.250
there; but I don’t know these people if they are feeling it.)

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:43.333
Now put another hand like that.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:50.000
[Blowing into microphone.]

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.917
(It’s like a mountain.)

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:20.125
Change your hands please, again.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:27.709
[Blowing into microphone.]

01:21:51.542 --> 01:21:54.875
Do you feel the cool breeze?

01:21:57.875 --> 01:22:00.500
Now, for your information, we have many people who are

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:03.250
realized souls who have come to Bath.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.959
And they will have a look at you.

01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:07.709
You can put your hands like this.

01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:10.375
Those who are not feeling the cool breeze, raise your

01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:13.041
hands first of all.

01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:15.792
Raise them high.

01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:16.500
All right. Come along now.

01:22:17.083 --> 01:22:19.250
Sahaja yogis should come and see them.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.875
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:28.750
In the head? In the head.

01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:32.041
Are you feeling relaxed?

01:22:32.625 --> 01:22:34.166
Good, good.

01:22:34.875 --> 01:22:38.000
What about you, from the Tibetan thing? Caleb – he’s

01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:40.834
good, good, good, he's done well!

01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:44.166
Caleb, see this one from the Tibetan one.

01:22:44.583 --> 01:22:47.041
He's a seeker, out and out. He's got it?

01:22:47.583 --> 01:22:54.417
No? He's been to some guru, I … Just see their chakras,

01:22:54.834 --> 01:22:55.875
is what are catching is.

01:22:56.417 --> 01:22:59.917
Just work on the chakras.

01:23:07.667 --> 01:23:09.792
Ah, better. It's better now.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.999
But in the hands you have to feel.

01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:15.417
Now keep your hands like this.

01:23:15.875 --> 01:23:18.583
Hands you must feel it. Beg pardon? …

01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:20.583
It becomes cooler.

01:23:20.999 --> 01:23:22.375
First it is hot.

01:23:22.625 --> 01:23:24.333
Hands are hot now?

01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:28.667
All right. Now this is a miracle, isn't it?

01:23:28.999 --> 01:23:31.417
Now, you put your left hand on your stomach, here.

01:23:31.834 --> 01:23:32.875
No, this side.

01:23:33.291 --> 01:23:36.208
Right hand towards Me, yeah. Now, it's good.

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:54.083
She's feeling the hot, that's all.

01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:58.583
But she'll get it. Just she will be ... no, put her on the liver

01:23:58.917 --> 01:24:01.291
– left hand on the liver, yes.

01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:04.500
He is himself a doctor, you see.

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:13.333
Did she get, this lady who was asking questions?

01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:15.959
What do you say? No?

01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:24.000
Warm? What’s, where is she catching?

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:35.500
He’s feeling it?

01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:37.999
Good, good. That's nice.

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:40.041
A Vishuddhi he has.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:41.999
He has a Vishuddhi.

01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:46.875
Let him ask if he – “I am the part and parcel of the whole”

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:50.250
will work out with him, because the Vishuddhi is catching.

01:25:11.166 --> 01:25:18.917
Is she? God, thank God, now! All right.

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:22.208
Yes, what is it?

01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:26.375
So much of left, I tell you, really.

01:25:35.417 --> 01:25:37.959
Hmm. What about you, why didn't you work?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.375
What do you say? Caleb?

01:25:48.083 --> 01:25:51.041
Anybody who has not felt it, please raise your hands.

01:25:51.458 --> 01:25:53.208
They have come all the way to help you, some of them

01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:56.583
have come from north country.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.041
Yes, sir. Someone  there.

01:26:00.166 --> 01:26:01.750
Can you see there?

01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:22.041
You all just watch Me without thinking.

01:26:22.458 --> 01:26:25.291
Just watch Me without thinking.
