The Ten Primordial Masters
by Rafael Sol

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.703
Dedicated to Her Holiness Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:13.852
Read by Tim Bruce

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.188
Shri Adi Guru Dattatreya has come
to this world many times.

00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:24.853
Ten times, in different reincarnations,
he came to change the course of humanity

00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:30.992
and to give it back the path of balance,
towards righteousness and spirituality.

00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:34.641
Again and again, he established
the values of dharma,

00:00:34.842 --> 00:00:39.656
that is, the way to follow for the spiritual
ascent of human beings.

00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:42.313
We must cross the first stage
of the journey,

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:47.016
through the ocean of illusions,
by meditation and detachment.

00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:51.929
Then we become our own teacher
and our own student.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.023
When we respect dharma, the norms
of a divine conduct,

00:00:56.224 --> 00:01:02.484
we integrate the principles of citizenship,
respect, morals and ethics.

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:09.967
This is what makes us a good friend,
a good child and a good parent.

00:01:11.214 --> 00:01:13.607
Raja Janaka

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:21.216
King Janaka lived around 5000 years BC,
as King in Mithila (now Janakpur).

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:25.295
He was a great scientist and an enlightened
being.

00:01:25.496 --> 00:01:29.842
He was the father of Shri Sita, the wife
of Shri Rama.

00:01:30.043 --> 00:01:34.581
One day, King Raja Janaka sent a message
to his people:

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:40.479
"If there is a great sage, whether rich
or poor, very educated or not,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.384
if he can teach me the knowledge
of the Self, of my Spirit,

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:50.282
let him become my teacher. Otherwise,
I don't want to see him."

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:53.834
All the scholars of the time were
frightened by these words,

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:59.201
except for a young man called Ashtavakra,
who went directly to the king.

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:05.556
Ashtavakra said to the king, "First, let's
go to the forest, to a pure place.

00:02:05.757 --> 00:02:11.149
Second, listen only to me, without even
thinking about it."

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.720
So, they went alone to the forest and
there, King Janaka sat down near his horse

00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:20.471
and remained silent, his eyes closed,
without moving.

00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:24.784
He did not move even when his officers
and ministers came to call him.

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:28.885
It was only when Ashtavakra called him
that he moved.

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:33.384
Ashtavakra said to him, "Many people
have come.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:35.874
Why didn't you answer their calls?"

00:02:36.075 --> 00:02:41.249
The king said, "Thoughts, words and deeds
are in my head,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.655
and I promised not to think.

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:47.484
So, before I can use my head, I await
your permission.

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:51.952
What authority do I have to use my head
without your permission?"

00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:56.484
Ashtavakra then said, "You have
understood the Spirit.

00:02:56.685 --> 00:02:59.249
It is not the thoughts in your head.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.374
It is always there in you, even if you
do not think."

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:09.070
Another day, a young sage named Narada
asked King Janaka,

00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:12.976
"Sire, how is it possible that you are
detached from material goods

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:16.978
when you live in luxury?" King Janaka said,

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.351
"It's very simple. I'll tell you this
evening.

00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:24.640
Before that, you should follow me
everywhere, holding this bowl of milk.

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.906
Be careful not to spill a single drop!"

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:33.046
Narada did as he had been told, and
followed the king everywhere.

00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:36.570
By the end of the day, he was really
exhausted. "

00:03:36.771 --> 00:03:40.359
"Please, O great King Janaka, answer
my question now.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.581
I can't follow you everywhere and watch
this bowl of milk at the same time."

00:03:45.782 --> 00:03:51.195
King Janaka then asked, “What did you
see while following me?”

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:54.398
"Nothing but the bowl," replied Narada,

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.171
"I watched it all the time so as not
to spill the milk."

00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:03.332
The king exclaimed, "You did not see
the ceremony given in my honor?

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:09.254
Then the dance performance? Is it
possible that you did not see anything?"

00:04:09.455 --> 00:04:12.426
Narada said, "No, my Lord.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:16.902
I saw nothing at all. I was looking
at the milk."

00:04:17.103 --> 00:04:22.020
Then King Janaka replied, "I never see
anything either.

00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:27.507
I put my attention on my Spirit so as not
to forget my true nature,

00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:31.968
just like you with your milk."

00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:35.171
Abraham

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.757
Abraham lived between 1800 and 1600 BC,

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.699
and grew up in Ur in Mesopotamia.

00:04:43.907 --> 00:04:49.345
We know about his life through the stories
told in the Bible and in the Koran.

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:52.735
At that time, people believed in idols,

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:56.993
offered them sacrifices and performed
various primitive rites.

00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:00.552
Despite these beliefs, solid faith
in a single God

00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:03.990
had grown in Abraham since childhood.

00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:08.443
When he was very young, while seeking
to know the origin of creation,

00:05:08.644 --> 00:05:11.326
he sought advice from his father.

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:16.701
The latter, who worked in a store where
idols were sold, replied immediately,

00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:22.732
"It is this idol who created the world."
Abraham didnʼt believe it.

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:25.224
He went to ask his uncle who said to him,

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:29.404
"It is the Moon and the stars which created
the world."

00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:33.217
Abraham was still not convinced, because
he felt

00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:39.279
that an all-powerful Being in heaven could
have created the world: Yahweh.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.646
And one day, finally, God spoke to him.

00:05:42.854 --> 00:05:46.490
"Leave your country, your people and
your father's house

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:49.420
and go to the country that I will show you.

00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.763
I will make you a great nation and I will
bless you.

00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:58.285
I will make your name big, and you will
be a blessing.

00:05:58.486 --> 00:06:04.137
I will bless those who bless you.
I will curse those who curse you.

00:06:04.338 --> 00:06:08.262
And all the peoples of the earth will be
blessed in you."

00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:14.370
So, Abraham went with his wife and nephew
Lot to the promised land of Canaan

00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:17.417
(located in present-day Israel).

00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:22.140
When a period of famine was declared,
he and his wife went to Egypt,

00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:26.765
where they lived for a few years before
returning to the land of Canaan.

00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:32.288
Time was passing, but Abraham and Sarah
still had no children.

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:36.936
They were old now. So, they decided
to have one servant,

00:06:37.137 --> 00:06:41.216
Hagar, who gave Abraham a son called
Ishmael

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:45.675
(recognised as one of the patriarchs
of the Islamic religion).

00:06:45.883 --> 00:06:50.089
However, even though Sarah was more
than 80 years old,

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.613
God had promised them a child, and
the child finally arrived.

00:06:55.814 --> 00:07:00.769
He was called Isaac. But God tested
Abraham's faith.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.066
He asked him to sacrifice his beloved
son Isaac

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:10.011
by killing him to prove his love.
The faithful Abraham accepted.

00:07:10.212 --> 00:07:16.558
He was about to kill his son, when an Angel
of God stopped his arm just in time.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:23.281
Abraham died at the age of 175 years.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.921
Moses

00:07:26.122 --> 00:07:31.889
The life of Moses, born in 1300 BC,
is found in the Bible.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.668
At that time, the reigning Egyptian Pharaoh

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:39.733
had ordered all boys under the age of two
to drown in the Nile River,

00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:44.048
as it had been predicted that one of them
would defeat him.

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:50.128
To save Moses, his mother left him
in a small basket drifting on the Nile.

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:53.361
He was taken in secret by the daughter
of the Pharaoh

00:07:53.562 --> 00:07:56.649
and grew up in the court of Egypt.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:02.118
One day, Moses learned that he was not
an Egyptian but a Hebrew.

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.806
The Hebrews were now slaves.

00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:08.806
He killed an Egyptian guard while trying
to save a Hebrew slave.

00:08:09.007 --> 00:08:11.978
So, he fled from Egypt and went to Midian,

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:15.947
where he found refuge in the tribe
of the priest, Jethro.

00:08:16.148 --> 00:08:19.111
He married his daughter, Sephora.

00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:23.040
Many years later, God came to speak to him
to tell him

00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:28.962
that he would be his messenger to save
the Hebrew people from slavery in Egypt.

00:08:29.163 --> 00:08:32.554
Moses now had the power to work miracles.

00:08:32.755 --> 00:08:37.347
He went to the Pharaoh and asked him
to let the Hebrew people go.

00:08:37.548 --> 00:08:40.668
Of course, the Pharaoh refused.

00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:44.972
Moses, to convince the Pharaoh of
the existence of God and His Power,

00:08:45.173 --> 00:08:49.758
cursed the land of Egypt and launched
the ten plagues.

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:53.198
But the Pharaoh, who believed himself
to be a living god,

00:08:53.406 --> 00:08:55.899
did not want to know anything.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.946
Finally, at the tenth plague, he allowed
the Hebrews to leave.

00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:03.407
As the people reached the Red Sea,

00:09:03.615 --> 00:09:08.340
Pharaoh made one last attempt to attack
Moses and the Hebrews.

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:13.404
They were tracked down by the Egyptian
army and blocked by the sea.

00:09:13.605 --> 00:09:16.240
So God then manifested His omnipotence

00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:20.619
and allowed Moses to separate the waters
by creating a passage

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.440
so that they could cross the sea on dry
land.

00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:26.776
After escaping from Egypt,

00:09:26.977 --> 00:09:30.197
the Hebrews set out in search of
the Promised Land,

00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:36.234
during a long time of wandering that is
said to have lasted about 40 years.

00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:38.900
Moses gave his people a long list of laws

00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:42.892
to help them lead healthy and moral
social lives.

00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:46.979
Among these instructions he received
from God on Mount Sinai

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.627
are the Ten Commandments.

00:09:49.828 --> 00:09:57.517
Moses died, before reaching the Promised
Land, at the age of 120.

00:09:57.963 --> 00:10:01.516
Zarathoustra or Zoroaster

00:10:01.717 --> 00:10:07.277
Zoroaster was born in Persia (Iran)
in 630 BC.

00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:11.300
He was an energetic and very intelligent
young boy.

00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:15.359
At the age of 30, he went to fetch water
from the river.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.349
As he entered the water, Vohu Mana,

00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:21.531
the angel of the Good Spirit, appeared
to him

00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:27.257
and allowed him to see the divine Light
of God, Ahura Mazda.

00:10:27.458 --> 00:10:31.131
Dazzled, Zoroaster began to preach
in the capital of his country

00:10:31.332 --> 00:10:34.045
a few years after his vision.

00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:39.154
There is only one omnipresent and eternal
God, Ahura Mazda,

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:42.631
who is good and who is Light.

00:10:42.832 --> 00:10:45.115
But the people did not listen to him,

00:10:45.316 --> 00:10:49.115
and the priests violently rejected
his message.

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:52.521
Finally, he decided to go to other
countries,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.318
accompanied by only 23 companions.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:59.512
One day, at the age of 42,

00:10:59.713 --> 00:11:04.293
Zoroaster and his companions heard
of the king of a nearby country,

00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:09.441
King Vishtaspa, who was said to be wise
and just.

00:11:09.642 --> 00:11:12.293
When they arrived at King Vishtaspaʼs
court,

00:11:12.494 --> 00:11:16.526
the king granted Zoroaster an audience
and tested him

00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:20.620
to see if Zoroaster was really a sage.

00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:24.448
"Why do you want to acquire Knowledge?"
the king asked.

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:29.624
Zoroaster said to him, "To acquire the
knowledge of paying homage to God,

00:11:29.825 --> 00:11:34.338
I will meditate, as much as I can, to seek
righteousness."

00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:39.199
"And how are you going to fight the bad
people?" asked the king.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.465
Zoroaster said, "There is only one way
to overcome evil;

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:46.973
that is to increase Good.

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:50.481
There is only one way to eliminate
darkness;

00:11:50.682 --> 00:11:53.559
that is to spread the Light."

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.769
King Vishtaspa wanted to know more.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:02.160
He asked, "And how is the one God going
to help you?"

00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:07.699
Zoroaster was very happy to explain how
to pray to the Creator Lord: "

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.035
"Wise Lord, fulfil the desire of those
who are just

00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:16.988
and sincerely respect the principles
of righteousness and good spirit.

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:23.543
For I know that you always respond to
the songs of love seeking a reward."

00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:29.488
The king was convinced and adopted this
new religion of a single and good God.

00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:33.746
From that day on, Zoroaster was free
to propagate his teachings

00:12:33.947 --> 00:12:36.753
in this country and in neighbouring
countries.

00:12:36.954 --> 00:12:39.627
The teachings of Zoroaster have come
down to us

00:12:39.828 --> 00:12:44.136
through songs called "gathas".

00:12:44.601 --> 00:12:46.984
Confucius

00:12:47.169 --> 00:12:52.249
Confucius was born in Lu state in China
in 551 BC,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.871
into an aristocratic but poor family.

00:12:56.072 --> 00:12:58.692
At the age of three, his father died

00:12:58.893 --> 00:13:03.746
and his mother raised him and encouraged
him to study at the age of 15.

00:13:03.947 --> 00:13:06.512
But his mother died when he was 23,

00:13:06.713 --> 00:13:09.957
which forced him to give up working
at the court of his state,

00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:15.481
because he had to follow the traditional
mourning which lasted for three years.

00:13:15.682 --> 00:13:20.379
He therefore returned to the study
of ancient rites and texts.

00:13:20.588 --> 00:13:24.863
At that time, corruption and war reigned
in China.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.090
To change society, he decided to teach
traditional values

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:33.426
because he believed that education could
transform people.

00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:36.457
Students began to gather around him.

00:13:36.658 --> 00:13:42.363
Then Lu's sovereign went into exile,
and Confucius also fled the country.

00:13:42.564 --> 00:13:47.027
It was only at the age of 50 that he was
able to return.

00:13:47.228 --> 00:13:52.317
He then became the Minister of Justice
and advisor to the Prince of Lu.

00:13:52.518 --> 00:13:56.452
However, this success provoked jealousy
and hostility

00:13:56.653 --> 00:13:59.382
from the other people in the King's Court.

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:04.781
At 56 years old, Confucius was once again
forced to flee.

00:14:04.982 --> 00:14:08.515
But from place to place, from princes
to princes,

00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:12.132
nobody wanted to hear about education.

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:16.163
So, he left, accompanied by his students.

00:14:16.364 --> 00:14:19.468
Day by day, he improved his teachings.

00:14:19.669 --> 00:14:22.929
He created the example of the honest man.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.218
"The honest man,” he said, “is not a saint.

00:14:26.426 --> 00:14:29.421
The saints are born and remain saints,

00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:34.710
while the honest man becomes a saint
by study and self-discipline.

00:14:34.911 --> 00:14:41.373
A man of quality improves his education
by observing traditional rites."

00:14:41.574 --> 00:14:45.003
He also wanted to convey the idea
of balance,

00:14:45.188 --> 00:14:48.511
of the middle ground to achieve happiness.

00:14:48.712 --> 00:14:53.316
"The Middle is what does not lean towards
any extreme;

00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:58.911
to recognise what is extreme is to know
the Middle as a point of balance."

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:01.221
"Balance is the law of Heaven.

00:15:01.398 --> 00:15:05.463
Achieving it is the rule of life for
the honest man ...

00:15:05.664 --> 00:15:12.119
Some reach equilibrium in a single stroke
and others in 100 strokes.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.796
Some reach equilibrium in 10 strokes
and others in 1000 strokes.

00:15:18.957 --> 00:15:22.960
This is a rule of life that is certainly
accessible to men.

00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:29.155
The ignorant can therefore become
intelligent and the weak strong."

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:33.749
"To respect the principles of one's nature
is to approach harmony.

00:15:33.957 --> 00:15:37.944
And for that, you have to act towards
others

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:42.462
as you would like others to act towards
you."

00:15:42.663 --> 00:15:46.830
Seven days before dying, in 479 BC,

00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:50.088
he had a premonitory dream of his death.

00:15:50.289 --> 00:15:54.838
His only concern was that he had not
convinced the princes.

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:58.877
However, later, his teachings deeply
influenced

00:15:59.078 --> 00:16:06.804
culture and civilisation in China, Korea,
Japan and Vietnam.

00:16:07.543 --> 00:16:10.590
Lao Zi or Lao Tzu

00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:15.988
Lao Tzu was born around 500 or 600 BC
in China.

00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:19.508
Who was he really? We do not know,

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:24.422
but his name is an honorary title which
means Venerable Master.

00:16:24.623 --> 00:16:26.754
At the age of 160,

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:31.152
tired of seeing the townsmen live without
respect and without morals,

00:16:31.353 --> 00:16:35.057
he left for a spiritual retreat in the west
of China.

00:16:35.258 --> 00:16:38.307
When he arrived at the west gate of a small
town

00:16:38.508 --> 00:16:43.776
he was recognised by a guard who
immediately asked him to instruct him.

00:16:43.977 --> 00:16:48.362
"O noble master, give me a testimony
of your wisdom."

00:16:48.563 --> 00:16:53.935
Lao Tzu said, "He who knows does
not preach;

00:16:54.136 --> 00:16:57.958
he who preaches does not know."

00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:02.318
The guard then replied, "But how am I
going to learn?"

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:08.341
Lao Tzu said, "I will tell you about
the Way and the Virtue,

00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:11.630
which are the true masters of the noble
man.

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:13.974
I call it Tao.

00:17:14.175 --> 00:17:19.302
But the Tao that we can talk about is not
the eternal Tao."

00:17:19.503 --> 00:17:25.164
"So show me, O master, how to find wisdom,"
begged the guard, kneeling.

00:17:25.365 --> 00:17:30.396
"Stop thinking, and it will be the end
of your worries.

00:17:30.597 --> 00:17:34.411
What difference is there between yes
or no?

00:17:34.612 --> 00:17:39.021
What difference is there between success
and failure?

00:17:39.222 --> 00:17:41.810
Should we estimate what others think

00:17:42.011 --> 00:17:46.130
and avoid what others avoid?" replied
the master.

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:50.841
"It's a bit difficult to understand.
Who should I follow?"

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.739
Then Lao Tzu explained, "Nature has
no desire;

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:01.801
without desire, the heart calms down;
in this way everyone is calm...

00:18:02.002 --> 00:18:06.849
A strong wind never lasts long; nor does
heavy rain.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:13.163
If the ills of nature do not last, why 
should the ills of man last?"

00:18:13.364 --> 00:18:17.975
"So, you must not love in order not
to suffer," replied the guard.

00:18:18.176 --> 00:18:21.011
"No," said Lao Tzu,

00:18:21.212 --> 00:18:25.333
"compassion is the best weapon and
the best defence.

00:18:25.534 --> 00:18:27.635
If you want to establish harmony,

00:18:27.812 --> 00:18:30.830
compassion must surround you
like a fortress.

00:18:31.031 --> 00:18:34.838
Give love for hate."

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:38.632
Here is the legendary origin of Tao
Te Ching,

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:41.788
the great book of the Way and Virtue.

00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:46.460
It is a collection of poems written
in classical Chinese language,

00:18:46.661 --> 00:18:50.077
with rhymes and short verses for rhythm.

00:18:50.278 --> 00:18:54.436
The Tao is the Absolute, the union
of opposites,

00:18:54.637 --> 00:19:00.975
the union of being and non-being,
of masculine and feminine principles,

00:19:01.176 --> 00:19:06.358
of light and shadow, of strength
and weakness.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:10.835
These oppositions are represented
by Yin and Yang:

00:19:11.036 --> 00:19:15.092
Yin is the feminine, the intuitive,
sensitive side,

00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:20.217
while Yang is the masculine, the rational
side.

00:19:20.418 --> 00:19:25.139
The Tao is the harmonious union
of the two parts.

00:19:25.348 --> 00:19:29.163
If Confucius wanted to change society
through education,

00:19:29.364 --> 00:19:33.483
Lao Tzu wanted people to change
in themselves.

00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:39.421
These are the two internal and external
aspects that humanity must develop,

00:19:39.622 --> 00:19:42.136
and to change, one must become aware

00:19:42.337 --> 00:19:49.839
of this universal feminine energy that
created the world, the Tao.

00:19:50.603 --> 00:19:52.496
Socrates

00:19:52.704 --> 00:19:59.705
Socrates was born around 470 BC, probably
in May near Athens in Greece.

00:19:59.906 --> 00:20:04.828
He came from a wealthy family, and this
enabled him to study philosophy.

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:08.938
He served in the army of Athens and
fought in two battles.

00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:12.828
Socrates was very strong and very
courageous,

00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:17.088
and that is why he was part of the elite
of soldiers.

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:24.969
At the age of 35, he began to teach, in
the street, in gymnasiums, stadiums, shops,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:31.453
to all those who wanted to talk with him.
Philosophy for him was a way of life.

00:20:31.654 --> 00:20:34.367
He walked the streets of Athens, dressed
simply,

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:38.282
without shoes, and spoke with everyone.

00:20:38.483 --> 00:20:42.518
"I come among you, young and old,
to try to convince you

00:20:42.719 --> 00:20:46.524
that you should not care about wealth,
or anything else,

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:52.707
but only about your soul, so that
it becomes as good as possible.

00:20:52.908 --> 00:20:58.042
Virtue does not come from wealth, but
from virtue itself comes wealth

00:20:58.243 --> 00:21:04.925
and all the benefits for the people, both
in private and in public life."

00:21:05.126 --> 00:21:10.151
Sometimes he could remain standing and
motionless for several hours.

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:15.979
This was his way of practicing meditation,
called "dialogue with oneself",

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.382
a method of the philosophers of Antiquity.

00:21:19.583 --> 00:21:25.919
Later, he married Xanthippe at the age 
of 50 and they had three sons.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.614
As he was still not attracted to wealth,
luxury and comfort,

00:21:30.815 --> 00:21:33.223
he continued to give his lessons for free,

00:21:33.424 --> 00:21:36.988
even if his students were often
very wealthy.

00:21:37.189 --> 00:21:43.772
"The desire for possessions is the cause
of all wars, discords, battles.

00:21:43.973 --> 00:21:48.247
It is the body which gives birth to them
because of its passions.

00:21:48.448 --> 00:21:55.653
And if we are occupied in seizing riches,
it is the body whose slave we are."

00:21:55.854 --> 00:21:58.125
His success attracted the jealousies
of those

00:21:58.326 --> 00:22:02.911
who sold their educated skills for
a very high price.

00:22:03.112 --> 00:22:07.739
When he was 70 years old, three people
tried him and accused him

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.396
of "not recognising the same gods
as the state,

00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:16.381
of introducing new deities and
of corrupting the youth."

00:22:16.582 --> 00:22:21.335
However, their real motives were
political in nature.

00:22:21.536 --> 00:22:25.530
He was sentenced to death by drinking
a poison called hemlock.

00:22:25.731 --> 00:22:30.400
He refused the help of his friends
who wanted him to escape.

00:22:30.601 --> 00:22:33.963
Why did Socrates accept his judgment?

00:22:34.164 --> 00:22:40.355
Socrates was not afraid of death because
he knew that the soul is immortal.

00:22:40.556 --> 00:22:45.058
"The soul of anyone who feels intense
pain or pleasure believes

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:50.909
that what caused this intense emotion
is the only reality, real and obvious,

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.121
when this is not at all the case."

00:22:54.322 --> 00:22:59.288
He had lived in righteousness and wanted
to die in righteousness.

00:22:59.489 --> 00:23:05.678
He believed that philosophy is a spiritual
way of living in harmony with virtue.

00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:11.302
A few days after his death, the Athenians
repented and mourned,

00:23:11.503 --> 00:23:18.320
closed schools and theatres and condemned
his accusers.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.416
Prophet Muhammad

00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:26.900
Muhammad was probably born in 570
in the Arab city of Mecca.

00:23:27.101 --> 00:23:31.528
He belonged to one of the great noble
families, the Hashim Banu,

00:23:31.729 --> 00:23:34.466
but was not very wealthy himself.

00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:39.716
Muhammad lost his mother at the age of 8
and was raised by his uncle.

00:23:39.917 --> 00:23:46.169
He became a caravan driver. Then at the age
of 25, he married Khadĳa,

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.764
a wealthy and older woman who had been
divorced and was then a widow.

00:23:50.965 --> 00:23:54.522
They were happy for 25 years and had
6 children,

00:23:54.723 --> 00:24:01.046
but only four daughters survived. Among 
them was the young Fatima Zahra.

00:24:01.247 --> 00:24:05.632
One day, in 610, when Muhammad was
40 years old,

00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:10.475
he received a first Revelation from
the Archangel Gabriel called Jibril,

00:24:10.676 --> 00:24:13.960
in the cave of Hira where he was going
to meditate.

00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:21.163
God, or Allah, thus dictated to him
the verses of the Koran for 25 years.

00:24:21.364 --> 00:24:25.671
At first, people had to hide to practice
his teachings.

00:24:25.872 --> 00:24:29.269
Khadĳa was the first person to accept
Islam,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:34.183
and for the first three years, only
his relatives knew about it.

00:24:34.384 --> 00:24:37.706
Muhammad spoke of a religion dedicated
to the exclusive worship

00:24:37.907 --> 00:24:42.764
of the one, indivisible God of the Bible
revealed by Abraham.

00:24:42.965 --> 00:24:48.603
Indeed, the Koran praises the merits
of Abraham, Moses and Jesus.

00:24:48.804 --> 00:24:55.653
Mary, or Maryam, is called "Our Lady”
or "Sayyidunâ” by Muslims.

00:24:55.854 --> 00:25:00.380
"Allah chooses Maryam from among
all the women of creation.

00:25:00.598 --> 00:25:04.067
(Remember) when the Angels said: ʻO Mary,

00:25:04.268 --> 00:25:08.044
surely Allah has put you above
all the women of the worldsʼ

00:25:08.245 --> 00:25:11.871
(Koran Surah 3-42).

00:25:12.072 --> 00:25:16.175
She even has a whole surah, Surah 19.

00:25:16.376 --> 00:25:19.642
However, the government in power did
not like the idea

00:25:19.843 --> 00:25:24.694
of a single compassionate God because
they traded with idols.

00:25:24.895 --> 00:25:29.757
Then in 619, with the death of his uncle
and his wife Khadĳa,

00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:33.637
Muhammad lost his two precious supports
 in the city of Mecca

00:25:33.838 --> 00:25:38.122
and was forced to flee the first time
so as not to be killed.

00:25:38.323 --> 00:25:44.924
He later returned to Mecca, but in 622,
the Muslims had to emigrate to Medina.

00:25:45.125 --> 00:25:50.655
This flight, called the Hegira, marked
the year 0 of the Muslim calendar.

00:25:50.856 --> 00:25:54.194
It was the start of a period of wars.

00:25:54.395 --> 00:25:58.017
In January 630, the Prophet Muhammad
conquered Mecca

00:25:58.218 --> 00:26:03.738
with an army of ten thousand faithful
without opposition from its inhabitants.

00:26:03.939 --> 00:26:07.665
Two years later, he died in Medina.

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:11.283
Muhammad, having been poor although
of noble lineage,

00:26:11.484 --> 00:26:15.939
could neither read nor write. It was
40 years after his death

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.424
that the Koran was edited by the same
man who had killed Hazrat Ali,

00:26:20.632 --> 00:26:22.986
the son-in-law and cousin of the Prophet,

00:26:23.187 --> 00:26:26.400
and the husband of his daughter,
Fatima Zahra.

00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:31.471
Then he had their two sons, Hassan
and Hussein, murdered.

00:26:31.672 --> 00:26:35.942
The "sacred haddith" are the words
of the Prophet or Suna.

00:26:36.143 --> 00:26:40.466
They were compiled more than 150 years
after his death.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:45.708
These are advices on how to live according
to the moral principles of Allah:

00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:49.758
"God is merciful to those who are merciful
to others."

00:26:49.959 --> 00:26:53.094
(Haddith of the Prophet)

00:26:54.006 --> 00:26:55.664
Guru Nanak

00:26:55.865 --> 00:27:03.125
Guru Nanak was born in 1469 in present-day
Punjab in Pakistan, near Lahore.

00:27:03.326 --> 00:27:09.227
Very early on, Nanak received a literate
education, learning Sanskrit and Persian.

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:12.478
A precocious child, he was a natural
dreamer,

00:27:12.679 --> 00:27:15.492
much to the despair of his father.

00:27:15.693 --> 00:27:18.040
Several stories show that his father
was trying

00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:21.971
to turn his son's attention to worldly
affairs.

00:27:22.172 --> 00:27:26.099
Once, his father, Kalou, asked him to work
on their land,

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.223
but instead, Nanak meditated in the fields.

00:27:30.424 --> 00:27:36.528
"You are lazy, Nanak," said his father.
Guru Nanak replied, "I am not idle.

00:27:36.729 --> 00:27:43.771
I am busy looking after my own fields."
"Where are your fields then?" asked Kalou.

00:27:43.972 --> 00:27:50.171
Guru Nanak replied, "My body is a field.
My mind is the plowman.

00:27:50.398 --> 00:27:55.466
Virtue is culture. Modesty is water
for irrigation.

00:27:55.667 --> 00:27:59.536
I have sown the earth with the seed
of the Lord's sacred name.

00:27:59.737 --> 00:28:05.903
Satisfaction is the harrow of my field.
Humility is the hedge.

00:28:06.104 --> 00:28:10.364
The seeds will germinate in a good harvest
with love and devotion.

00:28:10.573 --> 00:28:15.794
Happy is the house which profits from
such a harvest!"

00:28:15.995 --> 00:28:20.942
Guru Nanak married Mata Sulakhni,
and they had two sons.

00:28:21.143 --> 00:28:24.005
He devoted himself to his family for
a few years,

00:28:24.206 --> 00:28:28.426
and then people began to recognise
his divine qualities.

00:28:28.627 --> 00:28:33.489
He was encouraged to travel and was given
material support to do so.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.722
At about 30 years old, he left for long
trips to India

00:28:37.923 --> 00:28:41.566
and beyond, to Medina, Turkey and Arabia.

00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:46.152
He spoke with all people, without
distinction of rank or caste,

00:28:46.353 --> 00:28:49.207
to give a message of love from God.

00:28:49.408 --> 00:28:53.566
He understood that there were neither
Hindus nor Muslims,

00:28:53.767 --> 00:29:00.238
just men loved by God. It was then
the birth of the Sikh religion.

00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:03.386
One day a disciple asked him,

00:29:03.587 --> 00:29:07.829
"But what must we really ask of God
to draw near to Him?"

00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:14.138
Guru Nanak replied: "Love God as the lotus
loves water,

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:20.344
as the bird Chatak loves the rain,
as the woman loves her husband.

00:29:20.545 --> 00:29:25.703
Make divine love the feather and make
your heart the writer.

00:29:25.904 --> 00:29:33.853
If you repeat the name of God, you live.
If you forget it, you die.

00:29:34.054 --> 00:29:37.329
Open your heart to Him."

00:29:37.828 --> 00:29:40.182
After years of traveling and preaching,

00:29:40.383 --> 00:29:44.142
Guru Nanak settled with his family
in Kartarpur.

00:29:44.343 --> 00:29:50.618
He died on September 22, 1539 at the age
of 69.

00:29:50.819 --> 00:29:53.640
His teachings are gathered in the Adi
Granth,

00:29:53.841 --> 00:29:57.497
the sacred book of the Sikhs.

00:29:58.212 --> 00:30:00.505
Saïnath

00:30:00.706 --> 00:30:06.339
Saïnathʼs birth is a mystery. No one knows
when or where he was born,

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.816
or even if Saïnath is his real name.

00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:13.527
He is believed to have been found
at the age of 4 or 5

00:30:13.728 --> 00:30:19.871
in the village of Selu in Maharastra,
India, in 1859.

00:30:20.072 --> 00:30:26.325
A stranger arrived in the village of Shirdi
around 1870, aged about 16,

00:30:26.526 --> 00:30:31.706
dressed in traditional fakir attire and
practicing yoga exercises.

00:30:31.907 --> 00:30:37.496
Imagine the astonishment of the villagers!
At first, they took him for a nice fool,

00:30:37.697 --> 00:30:40.933
because he lived alone and slept
on the floor.

00:30:41.134 --> 00:30:44.652
Then Saïnath settled in an abandoned
mosque,

00:30:44.853 --> 00:30:49.183
where he kept a fire and an oil lamp
permanently lit.

00:30:49.384 --> 00:30:53.550
He lived on gifts which he gave back
to the poorest of the people.

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:56.792
One day, lacking oil for his lamp,

00:30:56.993 --> 00:31:00.394
he asked a group of young people to give
him some.

00:31:00.595 --> 00:31:03.597
"Ah, but here it is," said one of them.

00:31:03.798 --> 00:31:08.371
But he laughed at Saïnath and only
gave him water.

00:31:08.572 --> 00:31:14.502
Very calmly he went home. The young
stupid men followed him to spy on him.

00:31:14.703 --> 00:31:19.480
They saw him put a little water in his
lamps and they lit up!

00:31:19.681 --> 00:31:23.425
Then, filled with shame, they understood

00:31:23.626 --> 00:31:28.253
that they were before a saint and asked
him to forgive them.

00:31:28.454 --> 00:31:33.199
Saïnath was cheerful, as forgiving was
easy for him.

00:31:33.407 --> 00:31:37.729
Soon, many devotees came to see him
from all over the country,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:43.175
attracted by his miracles. They began
to call him Shirdi Sai Baba

00:31:43.376 --> 00:31:49.143
because "Sai" means "Muslim saint",
and "Baba" means "father" in Hindi.

00:31:49.344 --> 00:31:52.339
Shirdi was his place of residence.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.690
Even though he had never studied,
he was very familiar

00:31:55.891 --> 00:32:00.535
with Islam and Hinduism and their
sacred texts.

00:32:00.736 --> 00:32:03.183
He was a vegetarian, like the Brahmins,

00:32:03.384 --> 00:32:07.785
but also wore simple clothes according
to Muslim custom.

00:32:07.986 --> 00:32:11.871
He declared himself to be both a Fakir
and a Brahmin,

00:32:12.072 --> 00:32:15.354
and believed in the unity of religions.

00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:20.653
He used to give people what they asked for,
even if they never came back to see him.

00:32:20.854 --> 00:32:24.957
He said, "I give my people what they want,

00:32:25.158 --> 00:32:30.496
so that they start to want what I really
want to give them."

00:32:30.697 --> 00:32:35.628
He was never strict or severe but he was
extremely patient.

00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:39.996
"If you stretch out the palms of your hands
towards me in devotion,

00:32:40.197 --> 00:32:44.831
I will be immediately with you, day
and night.

00:32:45.032 --> 00:32:47.457
Even if I am not physically with you,

00:32:47.658 --> 00:32:51.050
I know what you are doing beyond
the seven seas.

00:32:51.251 --> 00:32:56.566
Go where you want, in the wide world;
I am with you."

00:32:56.767 --> 00:33:01.425
He left this world on October 15, 1918,

00:33:01.626 --> 00:33:07.276
while sitting among his disciples in deep
meditation.
