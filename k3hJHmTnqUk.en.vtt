The Ten Primordial Masters
by Rafael Sol

00:05.625 --> 00:09.703
Dedicated to Her Holiness Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi

00:09.904 --> 00:13.852
Read by Tim Bruce

00:14.320 --> 00:19.188
Shri Adi Guru Dattatreya has come
to this world many times.

00:19.411 --> 00:24.853
Ten times, in different reincarnations,
he came to change the course of humanity

00:25.054 --> 00:30.992
and to give it back the path of balance,
towards righteousness and spirituality.

00:31.193 --> 00:34.641
Again and again, he established
the values of dharma,

00:34.842 --> 00:39.656
that is, the way to follow for the spiritual
ascent of human beings.

00:39.857 --> 00:42.313
We must cross the first stage
of the journey,

00:42.514 --> 00:47.016
through the ocean of illusions,
by meditation and detachment.

00:47.217 --> 00:51.929
Then we become our own teacher
and our own student.

00:52.130 --> 00:56.023
When we respect dharma, the norms
of a divine conduct,

00:56.224 --> 01:02.484
we integrate the principles of citizenship,
respect, morals and ethics.

01:02.685 --> 01:09.967
This is what makes us a good friend,
a good child and a good parent.

01:11.214 --> 01:13.607
Raja Janaka

01:13.808 --> 01:21.216
King Janaka lived around 5000 years BC,
as King in Mithila (now Janakpur).

01:21.417 --> 01:25.295
He was a great scientist and an enlightened
being.

01:25.496 --> 01:29.842
He was the father of Shri Sita, the wife
of Shri Rama.

01:30.043 --> 01:34.581
One day, King Raja Janaka sent a message
to his people:

01:34.782 --> 01:40.479
"If there is a great sage, whether rich
or poor, very educated or not,

01:40.680 --> 01:44.384
if he can teach me the knowledge
of the Self, of my Spirit,

01:44.585 --> 01:50.282
let him become my teacher. Otherwise,
I don't want to see him."

01:50.483 --> 01:53.834
All the scholars of the time were
frightened by these words,

01:54.035 --> 01:59.201
except for a young man called Ashtavakra,
who went directly to the king.

01:59.402 --> 02:05.556
Ashtavakra said to the king, "First, let's
go to the forest, to a pure place.

02:05.757 --> 02:11.149
Second, listen only to me, without even
thinking about it."

02:11.350 --> 02:15.720
So, they went alone to the forest and
there, King Janaka sat down near his horse

02:15.921 --> 02:20.471
and remained silent, his eyes closed,
without moving.

02:20.672 --> 02:24.784
He did not move even when his officers
and ministers came to call him.

02:24.985 --> 02:28.885
It was only when Ashtavakra called him
that he moved.

02:29.086 --> 02:33.384
Ashtavakra said to him, "Many people
have come.

02:33.585 --> 02:35.874
Why didn't you answer their calls?"

02:36.075 --> 02:41.249
The king said, "Thoughts, words and deeds
are in my head,

02:41.450 --> 02:43.655
and I promised not to think.

02:43.856 --> 02:47.484
So, before I can use my head, I await
your permission.

02:47.685 --> 02:51.952
What authority do I have to use my head
without your permission?"

02:52.161 --> 02:56.484
Ashtavakra then said, "You have
understood the Spirit.

02:56.685 --> 02:59.249
It is not the thoughts in your head.

02:59.450 --> 03:04.374
It is always there in you, even if you
do not think."

03:04.575 --> 03:09.070
Another day, a young sage named Narada
asked King Janaka,

03:09.271 --> 03:12.976
"Sire, how is it possible that you are
detached from material goods

03:13.177 --> 03:16.978
when you live in luxury?" King Janaka said,

03:17.179 --> 03:20.351
"It's very simple. I'll tell you this
evening.

03:20.552 --> 03:24.640
Before that, you should follow me
everywhere, holding this bowl of milk.

03:24.841 --> 03:27.906
Be careful not to spill a single drop!"

03:28.107 --> 03:33.046
Narada did as he had been told, and
followed the king everywhere.

03:33.247 --> 03:36.570
By the end of the day, he was really
exhausted. "

03:36.771 --> 03:40.359
"Please, O great King Janaka, answer
my question now.

03:40.560 --> 03:45.581
I can't follow you everywhere and watch
this bowl of milk at the same time."

03:45.782 --> 03:51.195
King Janaka then asked, “What did you
see while following me?”

03:51.403 --> 03:54.398
"Nothing but the bowl," replied Narada,

03:54.599 --> 03:58.171
"I watched it all the time so as not
to spill the milk."

03:58.372 --> 04:03.332
The king exclaimed, "You did not see
the ceremony given in my honor?

04:03.533 --> 04:09.254
Then the dance performance? Is it
possible that you did not see anything?"

04:09.455 --> 04:12.426
Narada said, "No, my Lord.

04:12.627 --> 04:16.902
I saw nothing at all. I was looking
at the milk."

04:17.103 --> 04:22.020
Then King Janaka replied, "I never see
anything either.

04:22.221 --> 04:27.507
I put my attention on my Spirit so as not
to forget my true nature,

04:27.708 --> 04:31.968
just like you with your milk."

04:33.075 --> 04:35.171
Abraham

04:35.379 --> 04:39.757
Abraham lived between 1800 and 1600 BC,

04:39.958 --> 04:43.699
and grew up in Ur in Mesopotamia.

04:43.907 --> 04:49.345
We know about his life through the stories
told in the Bible and in the Koran.

04:49.546 --> 04:52.735
At that time, people believed in idols,

04:52.936 --> 04:56.993
offered them sacrifices and performed
various primitive rites.

04:57.194 --> 05:00.552
Despite these beliefs, solid faith
in a single God

05:00.753 --> 05:03.990
had grown in Abraham since childhood.

05:04.191 --> 05:08.443
When he was very young, while seeking
to know the origin of creation,

05:08.644 --> 05:11.326
he sought advice from his father.

05:11.527 --> 05:16.701
The latter, who worked in a store where
idols were sold, replied immediately,

05:16.902 --> 05:22.732
"It is this idol who created the world."
Abraham didnʼt believe it.

05:22.933 --> 05:25.224
He went to ask his uncle who said to him,

05:25.425 --> 05:29.404
"It is the Moon and the stars which created
the world."

05:29.605 --> 05:33.217
Abraham was still not convinced, because
he felt

05:33.425 --> 05:39.279
that an all-powerful Being in heaven could
have created the world: Yahweh.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.646
And one day, finally, God spoke to him.

05:42.854 --> 05:46.490
"Leave your country, your people and
your father's house

05:46.667 --> 05:49.420
and go to the country that I will show you.

05:49.621 --> 05:53.763
I will make you a great nation and I will
bless you.

05:53.964 --> 05:58.285
I will make your name big, and you will
be a blessing.

05:58.486 --> 06:04.137
I will bless those who bless you.
I will curse those who curse you.

06:04.338 --> 06:08.262
And all the peoples of the earth will be
blessed in you."

06:08.463 --> 06:14.370
So, Abraham went with his wife and nephew
Lot to the promised land of Canaan

06:14.571 --> 06:17.417
(located in present-day Israel).

06:17.618 --> 06:22.140
When a period of famine was declared,
he and his wife went to Egypt,

06:22.341 --> 06:26.765
where they lived for a few years before
returning to the land of Canaan.

06:26.973 --> 06:32.288
Time was passing, but Abraham and Sarah
still had no children.

06:32.489 --> 06:36.936
They were old now. So, they decided
to have one servant,

06:37.137 --> 06:41.216
Hagar, who gave Abraham a son called
Ishmael

06:41.417 --> 06:45.675
(recognised as one of the patriarchs
of the Islamic religion).

06:45.883 --> 06:50.089
However, even though Sarah was more
than 80 years old,

06:50.290 --> 06:55.613
God had promised them a child, and
the child finally arrived.

06:55.814 --> 07:00.769
He was called Isaac. But God tested
Abraham's faith.

07:00.970 --> 07:04.066
He asked him to sacrifice his beloved
son Isaac

07:04.267 --> 07:10.011
by killing him to prove his love.
The faithful Abraham accepted.

07:10.212 --> 07:16.558
He was about to kill his son, when an Angel
of God stopped his arm just in time.

07:16.759 --> 07:23.281
Abraham died at the age of 175 years.

07:23.949 --> 07:25.921
Moses

07:26.122 --> 07:31.889
The life of Moses, born in 1300 BC,
is found in the Bible.

07:32.090 --> 07:34.668
At that time, the reigning Egyptian Pharaoh

07:34.869 --> 07:39.733
had ordered all boys under the age of two
to drown in the Nile River,

07:39.942 --> 07:44.048
as it had been predicted that one of them
would defeat him.

07:44.249 --> 07:50.128
To save Moses, his mother left him
in a small basket drifting on the Nile.

07:50.329 --> 07:53.361
He was taken in secret by the daughter
of the Pharaoh

07:53.562 --> 07:56.649
and grew up in the court of Egypt.

07:56.850 --> 08:02.118
One day, Moses learned that he was not
an Egyptian but a Hebrew.

08:02.319 --> 08:04.806
The Hebrews were now slaves.

08:05.007 --> 08:08.806
He killed an Egyptian guard while trying
to save a Hebrew slave.

08:09.007 --> 08:11.978
So, he fled from Egypt and went to Midian,

08:12.179 --> 08:15.947
where he found refuge in the tribe
of the priest, Jethro.

08:16.148 --> 08:19.111
He married his daughter, Sephora.

08:19.312 --> 08:23.040
Many years later, God came to speak to him
to tell him

08:23.241 --> 08:28.962
that he would be his messenger to save
the Hebrew people from slavery in Egypt.

08:29.163 --> 08:32.554
Moses now had the power to work miracles.

08:32.755 --> 08:37.347
He went to the Pharaoh and asked him
to let the Hebrew people go.

08:37.548 --> 08:40.668
Of course, the Pharaoh refused.

08:40.869 --> 08:44.972
Moses, to convince the Pharaoh of
the existence of God and His Power,

08:45.173 --> 08:49.758
cursed the land of Egypt and launched
the ten plagues.

08:49.959 --> 08:53.198
But the Pharaoh, who believed himself
to be a living god,

08:53.406 --> 08:55.899
did not want to know anything.

08:56.100 --> 09:00.946
Finally, at the tenth plague, he allowed
the Hebrews to leave.

09:01.147 --> 09:03.407
As the people reached the Red Sea,

09:03.615 --> 09:08.340
Pharaoh made one last attempt to attack
Moses and the Hebrews.

09:08.541 --> 09:13.404
They were tracked down by the Egyptian
army and blocked by the sea.

09:13.605 --> 09:16.240
So God then manifested His omnipotence

09:16.417 --> 09:20.619
and allowed Moses to separate the waters
by creating a passage

09:20.820 --> 09:24.440
so that they could cross the sea on dry
land.

09:24.641 --> 09:26.776
After escaping from Egypt,

09:26.977 --> 09:30.197
the Hebrews set out in search of
the Promised Land,

09:30.398 --> 09:36.234
during a long time of wandering that is
said to have lasted about 40 years.

09:36.435 --> 09:38.900
Moses gave his people a long list of laws

09:39.101 --> 09:42.892
to help them lead healthy and moral
social lives.

09:43.093 --> 09:46.979
Among these instructions he received
from God on Mount Sinai

09:47.180 --> 09:49.627
are the Ten Commandments.

09:49.828 --> 09:57.517
Moses died, before reaching the Promised
Land, at the age of 120.

09:57.963 --> 10:01.516
Zarathoustra or Zoroaster

10:01.717 --> 10:07.277
Zoroaster was born in Persia (Iran)
in 630 BC.

10:07.477 --> 10:11.300
He was an energetic and very intelligent
young boy.

10:11.501 --> 10:15.359
At the age of 30, he went to fetch water
from the river.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.349
As he entered the water, Vohu Mana,

10:18.552 --> 10:21.531
the angel of the Good Spirit, appeared
to him

10:21.732 --> 10:27.257
and allowed him to see the divine Light
of God, Ahura Mazda.

10:27.458 --> 10:31.131
Dazzled, Zoroaster began to preach
in the capital of his country

10:31.332 --> 10:34.045
a few years after his vision.

10:34.246 --> 10:39.154
There is only one omnipresent and eternal
God, Ahura Mazda,

10:39.355 --> 10:42.631
who is good and who is Light.

10:42.832 --> 10:45.115
But the people did not listen to him,

10:45.316 --> 10:49.115
and the priests violently rejected
his message.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.521
Finally, he decided to go to other
countries,

10:52.690 --> 10:56.318
accompanied by only 23 companions.

10:56.519 --> 10:59.512
One day, at the age of 42,

10:59.713 --> 11:04.293
Zoroaster and his companions heard
of the king of a nearby country,

11:04.494 --> 11:09.441
King Vishtaspa, who was said to be wise
and just.

11:09.642 --> 11:12.293
When they arrived at King Vishtaspaʼs
court,

11:12.494 --> 11:16.526
the king granted Zoroaster an audience
and tested him

11:16.727 --> 11:20.620
to see if Zoroaster was really a sage.

11:20.821 --> 11:24.448
"Why do you want to acquire Knowledge?"
the king asked.

11:24.649 --> 11:29.624
Zoroaster said to him, "To acquire the
knowledge of paying homage to God,

11:29.825 --> 11:34.338
I will meditate, as much as I can, to seek
righteousness."

11:34.539 --> 11:39.199
"And how are you going to fight the bad
people?" asked the king.

11:39.400 --> 11:44.465
Zoroaster said, "There is only one way
to overcome evil;

11:44.666 --> 11:46.973
that is to increase Good.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.481
There is only one way to eliminate
darkness;

11:50.682 --> 11:53.559
that is to spread the Light."

11:53.760 --> 11:56.769
King Vishtaspa wanted to know more.

11:56.970 --> 12:02.160
He asked, "And how is the one God going
to help you?"

12:02.361 --> 12:07.699
Zoroaster was very happy to explain how
to pray to the Creator Lord: "

12:07.900 --> 12:12.035
"Wise Lord, fulfil the desire of those
who are just

12:12.236 --> 12:16.988
and sincerely respect the principles
of righteousness and good spirit.

12:17.189 --> 12:23.543
For I know that you always respond to
the songs of love seeking a reward."

12:23.744 --> 12:29.488
The king was convinced and adopted this
new religion of a single and good God.

12:29.689 --> 12:33.746
From that day on, Zoroaster was free
to propagate his teachings

12:33.947 --> 12:36.753
in this country and in neighbouring
countries.

12:36.954 --> 12:39.627
The teachings of Zoroaster have come
down to us

12:39.828 --> 12:44.136
through songs called "gathas".

12:44.601 --> 12:46.984
Confucius

12:47.169 --> 12:52.249
Confucius was born in Lu state in China
in 551 BC,

12:52.450 --> 12:55.871
into an aristocratic but poor family.

12:56.072 --> 12:58.692
At the age of three, his father died

12:58.893 --> 13:03.746
and his mother raised him and encouraged
him to study at the age of 15.

13:03.947 --> 13:06.512
But his mother died when he was 23,

13:06.713 --> 13:09.957
which forced him to give up working
at the court of his state,

13:10.158 --> 13:15.481
because he had to follow the traditional
mourning which lasted for three years.

13:15.682 --> 13:20.379
He therefore returned to the study
of ancient rites and texts.

13:20.588 --> 13:24.863
At that time, corruption and war reigned
in China.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.090
To change society, he decided to teach
traditional values

13:29.291 --> 13:33.426
because he believed that education could
transform people.

13:33.595 --> 13:36.457
Students began to gather around him.

13:36.658 --> 13:42.363
Then Lu's sovereign went into exile,
and Confucius also fled the country.

13:42.564 --> 13:47.027
It was only at the age of 50 that he was
able to return.

13:47.228 --> 13:52.317
He then became the Minister of Justice
and advisor to the Prince of Lu.

13:52.518 --> 13:56.452
However, this success provoked jealousy
and hostility

13:56.653 --> 13:59.382
from the other people in the King's Court.

13:59.583 --> 14:04.781
At 56 years old, Confucius was once again
forced to flee.

14:04.982 --> 14:08.515
But from place to place, from princes
to princes,

14:08.716 --> 14:12.132
nobody wanted to hear about education.

14:12.317 --> 14:16.163
So, he left, accompanied by his students.

14:16.364 --> 14:19.468
Day by day, he improved his teachings.

14:19.669 --> 14:22.929
He created the example of the honest man.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.218
"The honest man,” he said, “is not a saint.

14:26.426 --> 14:29.421
The saints are born and remain saints,

14:29.614 --> 14:34.710
while the honest man becomes a saint
by study and self-discipline.

14:34.911 --> 14:41.373
A man of quality improves his education
by observing traditional rites."

14:41.574 --> 14:45.003
He also wanted to convey the idea
of balance,

14:45.188 --> 14:48.511
of the middle ground to achieve happiness.

14:48.712 --> 14:53.316
"The Middle is what does not lean towards
any extreme;

14:53.517 --> 14:58.911
to recognise what is extreme is to know
the Middle as a point of balance."

14:59.119 --> 15:01.221
"Balance is the law of Heaven.

15:01.398 --> 15:05.463
Achieving it is the rule of life for
the honest man ...

15:05.664 --> 15:12.119
Some reach equilibrium in a single stroke
and others in 100 strokes.

15:12.320 --> 15:18.796
Some reach equilibrium in 10 strokes
and others in 1000 strokes.

15:18.957 --> 15:22.960
This is a rule of life that is certainly
accessible to men.

15:23.161 --> 15:29.155
The ignorant can therefore become
intelligent and the weak strong."

15:29.356 --> 15:33.749
"To respect the principles of one's nature
is to approach harmony.

15:33.957 --> 15:37.944
And for that, you have to act towards
others

15:38.145 --> 15:42.462
as you would like others to act towards
you."

15:42.663 --> 15:46.830
Seven days before dying, in 479 BC,

15:47.031 --> 15:50.088
he had a premonitory dream of his death.

15:50.289 --> 15:54.838
His only concern was that he had not
convinced the princes.

15:55.039 --> 15:58.877
However, later, his teachings deeply
influenced

15:59.078 --> 16:06.804
culture and civilisation in China, Korea,
Japan and Vietnam.

16:07.543 --> 16:10.590
Lao Zi or Lao Tzu

16:10.791 --> 16:15.988
Lao Tzu was born around 500 or 600 BC
in China.

16:16.189 --> 16:19.508
Who was he really? We do not know,

16:19.709 --> 16:24.422
but his name is an honorary title which
means Venerable Master.

16:24.623 --> 16:26.754
At the age of 160,

16:26.955 --> 16:31.152
tired of seeing the townsmen live without
respect and without morals,

16:31.353 --> 16:35.057
he left for a spiritual retreat in the west
of China.

16:35.258 --> 16:38.307
When he arrived at the west gate of a small
town

16:38.508 --> 16:43.776
he was recognised by a guard who
immediately asked him to instruct him.

16:43.977 --> 16:48.362
"O noble master, give me a testimony
of your wisdom."

16:48.563 --> 16:53.935
Lao Tzu said, "He who knows does
not preach;

16:54.136 --> 16:57.958
he who preaches does not know."

16:58.159 --> 17:02.318
The guard then replied, "But how am I
going to learn?"

17:02.519 --> 17:08.341
Lao Tzu said, "I will tell you about
the Way and the Virtue,

17:08.542 --> 17:11.630
which are the true masters of the noble
man.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.974
I call it Tao.

17:14.175 --> 17:19.302
But the Tao that we can talk about is not
the eternal Tao."

17:19.503 --> 17:25.164
"So show me, O master, how to find wisdom,"
begged the guard, kneeling.

17:25.365 --> 17:30.396
"Stop thinking, and it will be the end
of your worries.

17:30.597 --> 17:34.411
What difference is there between yes
or no?

17:34.612 --> 17:39.021
What difference is there between success
and failure?

17:39.222 --> 17:41.810
Should we estimate what others think

17:42.011 --> 17:46.130
and avoid what others avoid?" replied
the master.

17:46.331 --> 17:50.841
"It's a bit difficult to understand.
Who should I follow?"

17:51.050 --> 17:55.739
Then Lao Tzu explained, "Nature has
no desire;

17:55.940 --> 18:01.801
without desire, the heart calms down;
in this way everyone is calm...

18:02.002 --> 18:06.849
A strong wind never lasts long; nor does
heavy rain.

18:07.050 --> 18:13.163
If the ills of nature do not last, why
should the ills of man last?"

18:13.364 --> 18:17.975
"So, you must not love in order not
to suffer," replied the guard.

18:18.176 --> 18:21.011
"No," said Lao Tzu,

18:21.212 --> 18:25.333
"compassion is the best weapon and
the best defence.

18:25.534 --> 18:27.635
If you want to establish harmony,

18:27.812 --> 18:30.830
compassion must surround you
like a fortress.

18:31.031 --> 18:34.838
Give love for hate."

18:35.039 --> 18:38.632
Here is the legendary origin of Tao
Te Ching,

18:38.833 --> 18:41.788
the great book of the Way and Virtue.

18:41.989 --> 18:46.460
It is a collection of poems written
in classical Chinese language,

18:46.661 --> 18:50.077
with rhymes and short verses for rhythm.

18:50.278 --> 18:54.436
The Tao is the Absolute, the union
of opposites,

18:54.637 --> 19:00.975
the union of being and non-being,
of masculine and feminine principles,

19:01.176 --> 19:06.358
of light and shadow, of strength
and weakness.

19:06.559 --> 19:10.835
These oppositions are represented
by Yin and Yang:

19:11.036 --> 19:15.092
Yin is the feminine, the intuitive,
sensitive side,

19:15.293 --> 19:20.217
while Yang is the masculine, the rational
side.

19:20.418 --> 19:25.139
The Tao is the harmonious union
of the two parts.

19:25.348 --> 19:29.163
If Confucius wanted to change society
through education,

19:29.364 --> 19:33.483
Lao Tzu wanted people to change
in themselves.

19:33.691 --> 19:39.421
These are the two internal and external
aspects that humanity must develop,

19:39.622 --> 19:42.136
and to change, one must become aware

19:42.337 --> 19:49.839
of this universal feminine energy that
created the world, the Tao.

19:50.603 --> 19:52.496
Socrates

19:52.704 --> 19:59.705
Socrates was born around 470 BC, probably
in May near Athens in Greece.

19:59.906 --> 20:04.828
He came from a wealthy family, and this
enabled him to study philosophy.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.938
He served in the army of Athens and
fought in two battles.

20:09.139 --> 20:12.828
Socrates was very strong and very
courageous,

20:13.029 --> 20:17.088
and that is why he was part of the elite
of soldiers.

20:17.289 --> 20:24.969
At the age of 35, he began to teach, in
the street, in gymnasiums, stadiums, shops,

20:25.170 --> 20:31.453
to all those who wanted to talk with him.
Philosophy for him was a way of life.

20:31.654 --> 20:34.367
He walked the streets of Athens, dressed
simply,

20:34.568 --> 20:38.282
without shoes, and spoke with everyone.

20:38.483 --> 20:42.518
"I come among you, young and old,
to try to convince you

20:42.719 --> 20:46.524
that you should not care about wealth,
or anything else,

20:46.725 --> 20:52.707
but only about your soul, so that
it becomes as good as possible.

20:52.908 --> 20:58.042
Virtue does not come from wealth, but
from virtue itself comes wealth

20:58.243 --> 21:04.925
and all the benefits for the people, both
in private and in public life."

21:05.126 --> 21:10.151
Sometimes he could remain standing and
motionless for several hours.

21:10.352 --> 21:15.979
This was his way of practicing meditation,
called "dialogue with oneself",

21:16.180 --> 21:19.382
a method of the philosophers of Antiquity.

21:19.583 --> 21:25.919
Later, he married Xanthippe at the age
of 50 and they had three sons.

21:26.120 --> 21:30.614
As he was still not attracted to wealth,
luxury and comfort,

21:30.815 --> 21:33.223
he continued to give his lessons for free,

21:33.424 --> 21:36.988
even if his students were often
very wealthy.

21:37.189 --> 21:43.772
"The desire for possessions is the cause
of all wars, discords, battles.

21:43.973 --> 21:48.247
It is the body which gives birth to them
because of its passions.

21:48.448 --> 21:55.653
And if we are occupied in seizing riches,
it is the body whose slave we are."

21:55.854 --> 21:58.125
His success attracted the jealousies
of those

21:58.326 --> 22:02.911
who sold their educated skills for
a very high price.

22:03.112 --> 22:07.739
When he was 70 years old, three people
tried him and accused him

22:07.940 --> 22:11.396
of "not recognising the same gods
as the state,

22:11.597 --> 22:16.381
of introducing new deities and
of corrupting the youth."

22:16.582 --> 22:21.335
However, their real motives were
political in nature.

22:21.536 --> 22:25.530
He was sentenced to death by drinking
a poison called hemlock.

22:25.731 --> 22:30.400
He refused the help of his friends
who wanted him to escape.

22:30.601 --> 22:33.963
Why did Socrates accept his judgment?

22:34.164 --> 22:40.355
Socrates was not afraid of death because
he knew that the soul is immortal.

22:40.556 --> 22:45.058
"The soul of anyone who feels intense
pain or pleasure believes

22:45.259 --> 22:50.909
that what caused this intense emotion
is the only reality, real and obvious,

22:51.110 --> 22:54.121
when this is not at all the case."

22:54.322 --> 22:59.288
He had lived in righteousness and wanted
to die in righteousness.

22:59.489 --> 23:05.678
He believed that philosophy is a spiritual
way of living in harmony with virtue.

23:05.879 --> 23:11.302
A few days after his death, the Athenians
repented and mourned,

23:11.503 --> 23:18.320
closed schools and theatres and condemned
his accusers.

23:19.510 --> 23:21.416
Prophet Muhammad

23:21.617 --> 23:26.900
Muhammad was probably born in 570
in the Arab city of Mecca.

23:27.101 --> 23:31.528
He belonged to one of the great noble
families, the Hashim Banu,

23:31.729 --> 23:34.466
but was not very wealthy himself.

23:34.667 --> 23:39.716
Muhammad lost his mother at the age of 8
and was raised by his uncle.

23:39.917 --> 23:46.169
He became a caravan driver. Then at the age
of 25, he married Khadĳa,

23:46.370 --> 23:50.764
a wealthy and older woman who had been
divorced and was then a widow.

23:50.965 --> 23:54.522
They were happy for 25 years and had
6 children,

23:54.723 --> 24:01.046
but only four daughters survived. Among
them was the young Fatima Zahra.

24:01.247 --> 24:05.632
One day, in 610, when Muhammad was
40 years old,

24:05.833 --> 24:10.475
he received a first Revelation from
the Archangel Gabriel called Jibril,

24:10.676 --> 24:13.960
in the cave of Hira where he was going
to meditate.

24:14.161 --> 24:21.163
God, or Allah, thus dictated to him
the verses of the Koran for 25 years.

24:21.364 --> 24:25.671
At first, people had to hide to practice
his teachings.

24:25.872 --> 24:29.269
Khadĳa was the first person to accept
Islam,

24:29.470 --> 24:34.183
and for the first three years, only
his relatives knew about it.

24:34.384 --> 24:37.706
Muhammad spoke of a religion dedicated
to the exclusive worship

24:37.907 --> 24:42.764
of the one, indivisible God of the Bible
revealed by Abraham.

24:42.965 --> 24:48.603
Indeed, the Koran praises the merits
of Abraham, Moses and Jesus.

24:48.804 --> 24:55.653
Mary, or Maryam, is called "Our Lady”
or "Sayyidunâ” by Muslims.

24:55.854 --> 25:00.380
"Allah chooses Maryam from among
all the women of creation.

25:00.598 --> 25:04.067
(Remember) when the Angels said: ʻO Mary,

25:04.268 --> 25:08.044
surely Allah has put you above
all the women of the worldsʼ

25:08.245 --> 25:11.871
(Koran Surah 3-42).

25:12.072 --> 25:16.175
She even has a whole surah, Surah 19.

25:16.376 --> 25:19.642
However, the government in power did
not like the idea

25:19.843 --> 25:24.694
of a single compassionate God because
they traded with idols.

25:24.895 --> 25:29.757
Then in 619, with the death of his uncle
and his wife Khadĳa,

25:29.958 --> 25:33.637
Muhammad lost his two precious supports
in the city of Mecca

25:33.838 --> 25:38.122
and was forced to flee the first time
so as not to be killed.

25:38.323 --> 25:44.924
He later returned to Mecca, but in 622,
the Muslims had to emigrate to Medina.

25:45.125 --> 25:50.655
This flight, called the Hegira, marked
the year 0 of the Muslim calendar.

25:50.856 --> 25:54.194
It was the start of a period of wars.

25:54.395 --> 25:58.017
In January 630, the Prophet Muhammad
conquered Mecca

25:58.218 --> 26:03.738
with an army of ten thousand faithful
without opposition from its inhabitants.

26:03.939 --> 26:07.665
Two years later, he died in Medina.

26:07.866 --> 26:11.283
Muhammad, having been poor although
of noble lineage,

26:11.484 --> 26:15.939
could neither read nor write. It was
40 years after his death

26:16.140 --> 26:20.424
that the Koran was edited by the same
man who had killed Hazrat Ali,

26:20.632 --> 26:22.986
the son-in-law and cousin of the Prophet,

26:23.187 --> 26:26.400
and the husband of his daughter,
Fatima Zahra.

26:26.601 --> 26:31.471
Then he had their two sons, Hassan
and Hussein, murdered.

26:31.672 --> 26:35.942
The "sacred haddith" are the words
of the Prophet or Suna.

26:36.143 --> 26:40.466
They were compiled more than 150 years
after his death.

26:40.667 --> 26:45.708
These are advices on how to live according
to the moral principles of Allah:

26:45.909 --> 26:49.758
"God is merciful to those who are merciful
to others."

26:49.959 --> 26:53.094
(Haddith of the Prophet)

26:54.006 --> 26:55.664
Guru Nanak

26:55.865 --> 27:03.125
Guru Nanak was born in 1469 in present-day
Punjab in Pakistan, near Lahore.

27:03.326 --> 27:09.227
Very early on, Nanak received a literate
education, learning Sanskrit and Persian.

27:09.428 --> 27:12.478
A precocious child, he was a natural
dreamer,

27:12.679 --> 27:15.492
much to the despair of his father.

27:15.693 --> 27:18.040
Several stories show that his father
was trying

27:18.241 --> 27:21.971
to turn his son's attention to worldly
affairs.

27:22.172 --> 27:26.099
Once, his father, Kalou, asked him to work
on their land,

27:26.300 --> 27:30.223
but instead, Nanak meditated in the fields.

27:30.424 --> 27:36.528
"You are lazy, Nanak," said his father.
Guru Nanak replied, "I am not idle.

27:36.729 --> 27:43.771
I am busy looking after my own fields."
"Where are your fields then?" asked Kalou.

27:43.972 --> 27:50.171
Guru Nanak replied, "My body is a field.
My mind is the plowman.

27:50.398 --> 27:55.466
Virtue is culture. Modesty is water
for irrigation.

27:55.667 --> 27:59.536
I have sown the earth with the seed
of the Lord's sacred name.

27:59.737 --> 28:05.903
Satisfaction is the harrow of my field.
Humility is the hedge.

28:06.104 --> 28:10.364
The seeds will germinate in a good harvest
with love and devotion.

28:10.573 --> 28:15.794
Happy is the house which profits from
such a harvest!"

28:15.995 --> 28:20.942
Guru Nanak married Mata Sulakhni,
and they had two sons.

28:21.143 --> 28:24.005
He devoted himself to his family for
a few years,

28:24.206 --> 28:28.426
and then people began to recognise
his divine qualities.

28:28.627 --> 28:33.489
He was encouraged to travel and was given
material support to do so.

28:33.690 --> 28:37.722
At about 30 years old, he left for long
trips to India

28:37.923 --> 28:41.566
and beyond, to Medina, Turkey and Arabia.

28:41.767 --> 28:46.152
He spoke with all people, without
distinction of rank or caste,

28:46.353 --> 28:49.207
to give a message of love from God.

28:49.408 --> 28:53.566
He understood that there were neither
Hindus nor Muslims,

28:53.767 --> 29:00.238
just men loved by God. It was then
the birth of the Sikh religion.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.386
One day a disciple asked him,

29:03.587 --> 29:07.829
"But what must we really ask of God
to draw near to Him?"

29:08.038 --> 29:14.138
Guru Nanak replied: "Love God as the lotus
loves water,

29:14.339 --> 29:20.344
as the bird Chatak loves the rain,
as the woman loves her husband.

29:20.545 --> 29:25.703
Make divine love the feather and make
your heart the writer.

29:25.904 --> 29:33.853
If you repeat the name of God, you live.
If you forget it, you die.

29:34.054 --> 29:37.329
Open your heart to Him."

29:37.828 --> 29:40.182
After years of traveling and preaching,

29:40.383 --> 29:44.142
Guru Nanak settled with his family
in Kartarpur.

29:44.343 --> 29:50.618
He died on September 22, 1539 at the age
of 69.

29:50.819 --> 29:53.640
His teachings are gathered in the Adi
Granth,

29:53.841 --> 29:57.497
the sacred book of the Sikhs.

29:58.212 --> 30:00.505
Saïnath

30:00.706 --> 30:06.339
Saïnathʼs birth is a mystery. No one knows
when or where he was born,

30:06.540 --> 30:09.816
or even if Saïnath is his real name.

30:10.017 --> 30:13.527
He is believed to have been found
at the age of 4 or 5

30:13.728 --> 30:19.871
in the village of Selu in Maharastra,
India, in 1859.

30:20.072 --> 30:26.325
A stranger arrived in the village of Shirdi
around 1870, aged about 16,

30:26.526 --> 30:31.706
dressed in traditional fakir attire and
practicing yoga exercises.

30:31.907 --> 30:37.496
Imagine the astonishment of the villagers!
At first, they took him for a nice fool,

30:37.697 --> 30:40.933
because he lived alone and slept
on the floor.

30:41.134 --> 30:44.652
Then Saïnath settled in an abandoned
mosque,

30:44.853 --> 30:49.183
where he kept a fire and an oil lamp
permanently lit.

30:49.384 --> 30:53.550
He lived on gifts which he gave back
to the poorest of the people.

30:53.751 --> 30:56.792
One day, lacking oil for his lamp,

30:56.993 --> 31:00.394
he asked a group of young people to give
him some.

31:00.595 --> 31:03.597
"Ah, but here it is," said one of them.

31:03.798 --> 31:08.371
But he laughed at Saïnath and only
gave him water.

31:08.572 --> 31:14.502
Very calmly he went home. The young
stupid men followed him to spy on him.

31:14.703 --> 31:19.480
They saw him put a little water in his
lamps and they lit up!

31:19.681 --> 31:23.425
Then, filled with shame, they understood

31:23.626 --> 31:28.253
that they were before a saint and asked
him to forgive them.

31:28.454 --> 31:33.199
Saïnath was cheerful, as forgiving was
easy for him.

31:33.407 --> 31:37.729
Soon, many devotees came to see him
from all over the country,

31:37.930 --> 31:43.175
attracted by his miracles. They began
to call him Shirdi Sai Baba

31:43.376 --> 31:49.143
because "Sai" means "Muslim saint",
and "Baba" means "father" in Hindi.

31:49.344 --> 31:52.339
Shirdi was his place of residence.

31:52.540 --> 31:55.690
Even though he had never studied,
he was very familiar

31:55.891 --> 32:00.535
with Islam and Hinduism and their
sacred texts.

32:00.736 --> 32:03.183
He was a vegetarian, like the Brahmins,

32:03.384 --> 32:07.785
but also wore simple clothes according
to Muslim custom.

32:07.986 --> 32:11.871
He declared himself to be both a Fakir
and a Brahmin,

32:12.072 --> 32:15.354
and believed in the unity of religions.

32:15.555 --> 32:20.653
He used to give people what they asked for,
even if they never came back to see him.

32:20.854 --> 32:24.957
He said, "I give my people what they want,

32:25.158 --> 32:30.496
so that they start to want what I really
want to give them."

32:30.697 --> 32:35.628
He was never strict or severe but he was
extremely patient.

32:35.829 --> 32:39.996
"If you stretch out the palms of your hands
towards me in devotion,

32:40.197 --> 32:44.831
I will be immediately with you, day
and night.

32:45.032 --> 32:47.457
Even if I am not physically with you,

32:47.658 --> 32:51.050
I know what you are doing beyond
the seven seas.

32:51.251 --> 32:56.566
Go where you want, in the wide world;
I am with you."

32:56.767 --> 33:01.425
He left this world on October 15, 1918,

33:01.626 --> 33:07.276
while sitting among his disciples in deep
meditation.
