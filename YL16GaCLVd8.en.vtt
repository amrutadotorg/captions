00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.140
So today is the day when we have to introspect.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.580
So should we go into meditation, all of us?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.580
Please close your eyes.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.740
All of you close your eyes.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.580
Now we all will do the meditation the way we have been doing in the halls

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.100
wherever we had public programs.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.140
So the first you have to put your hand on your heart.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.300
We'll work on the left hand side, and the left hand towards me.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.500
Now, first of all, you put your hand on your heart.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.380
In the heart resides Shiva, is the Spirit.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:58.980
So, you have to thank your Spirit that it has brought light to your attention,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.860
because you're a saint and the light that has come in your heart

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.620
has to enlighten the whole world.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.580
So, please, now in your heart, you pray that,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.620
"Let this light of my love of the Divine spread to the whole world."

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.460
With all sincerity and understanding

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.260
that you are connected with the Divine and whatever you desire will happen

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.900
with full confidence in yourself.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.580
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.540
on the left hand side, on the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.580
And now here is the center of your dharma.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.380
Here you have to pray that,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.660
"Let Vishwa Nirmal Dharma spread in the whole world.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.660
Let people see the light through our dharmic life; through our righteousness.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.380
Let people see them and accept the Vishwa Nirmal Dharm

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.500
by which they get enlightenment and a benevolent higher life

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.460
and a desire to ascend."

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.900
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen of the stomach

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.420
on the left hand side. Press it.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.020
Now this is the center of pure knowledge.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.780
Here you have to say as Sahaja Yogis

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:12.060
that "our Mother has given us the full idea how the Divine works.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.820
She has given us all the mantras and all the pure knowledge

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.700
that we could bear and understand.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.460
Let me fully be knowledgeable about that, all of us."

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.660
I have seen if the man is a leader,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.860
the wife doesn't know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.540
If the woman knows about Sahaja Yoga, the husband doesn't know anything about it.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:48.860
"Let me be proficient and an expert in this knowledge

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.180
so that I can give realization to people,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.060
make them understand what is Divine Law,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.220
what is Kundalini, and what are the chakras.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.060
Let my attention be more on Sahaja Yoga than all these mundane things."

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.020
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.780
Close your eyes. Now here on the left hand side, press it.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:45.260
Now here, "Mother has given me the Spirit, and I have my own guru

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.820
which is the Spirit. I am master of my own.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.900
Let there be no abandonment. Let there be dignity in my character.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.380
Let there be generosity in my behavior.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:11.180
Let there be compassion and love for other Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:20.820
Let me not show off, but have a deep, deep knowledge about God's love

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.180
and His doings so that when people come to me,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.940
I should be able to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:39.460
and give them this great knowledge with humility and love."

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.220
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.580
Here you have to "Thank God that you have felt the ocean of joy

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.580
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.580
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.180
which we have seen is so tremendous.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:19.660
Let my heart expand and encompass the whole universe.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:27.180
And my love should resound the name of God."

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:38.220
The heart, every moment, should express the beauty of God's love.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.420
Take your now right hand in the Vishuddhi that is on the left Vishuddhi,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.700
between the neck and the shoulder in the corner.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:04.540
"I will not indulge into the falsehood of guilt, because I know it is falsehood.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:13.540
I will not escape my faults, but face them and eradicate them.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.060
I will not try to find faults with others,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:24.260
but in my own knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, let me remove their faults."

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.700
We have so many ways; secretly we can remove the faults of others.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.780
"Let my collectivity

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:46.740
become so great that the whole Sahaja Yoga race is my own family,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:53.500
my own children, my home, my everything.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.220
Let me get that feeling completely,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.020
innately built within myself that I am a part and a parcel of the whole,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.500
because we all have one Mother.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.980
And let my concern go to the whole world,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.780
to know what are their problems and how can,

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.060
through my true desire power, solve that.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.220
Let me feel the problems of the world in my heart,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:41.220
and innately to remove all of them from the basis of which they are,

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.980
from the basis from which they are generated.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.820
Let me go to the principles of all these problems

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.140
and try to remove them through my Sahaja Yoga powers,

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.300
through my saintly powers."

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.460
Now put your right hand on your forehead, across.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.380
Now here you have to say, first of all

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.980
"I have to forgive all those who have not come in Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.820
those who are on the periphery, who come and go,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.380
who jump in and jump out.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:26.260
But, first of all and foremost, I have to forgive all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.580
because they are all better than me.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.780
I'm the one, who tries to find faults with them,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.820
but I am at the lowest ebb and I have to forgive them

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.580
because I must know that I still have to go very further.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.140
I'm still much less. I have to improve myself."

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.900
This humility has to come within us, so you have to say here

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.460
"Let the humility in my heart, in a true sense,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:06.020
not hypocritical, work out this feeling of forgiveness,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:15.860
so that I bow to reality, to God, and to Sahaja Yoga."

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.020
Now you have to put back your hand on the backside of your head

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.660
and push back your head here. And you have to say here,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.260
"O Mother, whatever wrong we have done to You so far,

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.820
whatever wrong goes in our minds,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.740
and whatever smallness we have shown to You,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.740
whatever way we have troubled You and challenged You, please forgive us.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.580
" You have to ask for forgiveness.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.940
In your intelligence you should know what I am.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.780
I don't have to tell you again and again.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.740
Now at Sahasrara you have to thank Me. At Sahasrara, put your hand,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.940
move it seven times, and thank Me seven times,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.460
"Mother thank You very much for the realization.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.580
And Mother, thank You very much for making us understand how great we are.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.540
And thank You very much for bringing all the blessings of the Divine.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.260
And thank You very much for raising us higher, much higher,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.060
than from where we were.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.540
And also thank You very much for sustaining us

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.060
and for helping us to improve ourselves and correct ourselves.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.180
And thank You very much ultimately that Mother,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.820
You have come on this earth, taken Your birth,

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:34.060
and working so hard for us, for all of us."

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.620
Press it hard and move it hard.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.780
Now take down your hands.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.300
Heads are all very hot.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.300
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.220
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.940
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.060
Now again, second one.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.460
Now the third one.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.180
Now the fourth one.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.940
Now the fifth.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.820
Now the sixth one.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.100
And now the seventh.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.020
Now raise your Kundalini. Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.860
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.780
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.260
one knot.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.580
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.020
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.460
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.220
Take it to your head, push back your head and give it two knots there,

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.980
one and two.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.460
Now let's do the other one.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.220
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:44.580
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:55.660
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.660
Now see your vibrations.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.500
See your vibrations. Like this.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.620
All the children, see your vibrations. Like this. Put your hands.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:45.620
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.820
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
