1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,268
Warren’s words have really moved my heart,

2
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:20,085
and if England is my heart, England should
also feel moved:

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,929
that’s the spirit of Shri Ganesha.

4
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:39,728
And I must say that I have seen so many
things in Warren,

5
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:43,863
which are very heartening.

6
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:46,294
Whenever I have felt desperate about
things, you see,

7
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:57,262
seeing him I felt I must do something more,

8
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:07,180
because he really loves me very much,
I have seen that,

9
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,978
with complete selfless dedication.

10
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:29,939
But ‘dedication’ is a word which doesn’t
have that beauty of love.

11
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,793
I mean, if I’m sitting down he’ll
immediately worry

12
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:41,235
if I have got the tea, or if I need some
heating,

13
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:46,576
or little things here and there, and I
watch — I’m surprised.

14
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:51,461
 Like any other Sahaja Yogi he’ll be
jumping up here and there

15
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:56,046
and finding out things to adjust.

16
00:01:57,132 --> 00:02:05,501
And even if I really once say that,
“Maybe,”

17
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:11,995
he just doesn’t do it, just doesn’t do it.
He said, “That’s it, settled!”

18
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:16,582
I have never seen him asking me to give
him time to meet him, never.

19
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:23,511
Not even once he said, “Mother, I must come
and see you!” nothing, never!

20
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:33,386
I have not known how much money he spent
all throughout his trip.

21
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,970
I don’t know, really.

22
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:41,393
And I was wanting somebody to say that,
“Mother, we must pay for his travel!”

23
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,900
because he’s really spent all his money.

24
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:51,950
And I was happy that David brought this
point to me, I was very happy.

25
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:03,355
One thing I feel [is] that you cannot ask
for love,

26
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:07,289
that’s something you cannot do.

27
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:13,436
It’s a very difficult thing to ask somebody
to love,

28
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:17,958
but that, I think, is the point one should
see.

29
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,364
When you think of Shri Ganesh,

30
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:28,039
you just have to know that He loves
the Mother so much

31
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,906
that even a slightest hint, He knows what
I want, He knows.

32
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:39,545
He knows me too well.

33
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:51,671
He’s not at all so compassionate as myself,

34
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:57,281
because He cannot forgive those who try
to insult me, He cannot.

35
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:03,555
Those who try to cheat me, those who try
to be arrogant or egoistical.

36
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:08,195
He doesn’t, he doesn’t believe in that,
He cannot.

37
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,528
He wants to punish.

38
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:14,773
He’s ready to punish, very anxious
to punish such people.

39
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:19,874
But if I say, “No. Spare him,” He listens
to me.

40
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:26,731
That’s His quality: He cannot bear anything
against me, cannot bear it!

41
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:34,439
And left to Him, I think I don’t know how
many Sahaj Yogis would have been there.

42
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:41,349
Even to say, “No Mother!” itself, He cuts
you out on that point.

43
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,746
But I don’t want that it should happen,
because He doesn’t know

44
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:56,303
that you are still needing help, and
attention, and tremendous compassion.

45
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:04,754
But you can only know your Mother through
shraddha, through faith.

46
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:08,664
And what he says is true. And why this
faith?

47
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:13,312
I mean you see miracles every day, not
only to him:

48
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:17,314
such games, such plays, such things going
on;

49
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:22,075
how I have been able to express myself
slowly.

50
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:25,547
I don’t want to give you any shocks.

51
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:36,624
So in a very beautiful manner I have tried
to bring forth the play of the Divine.

52
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:45,892
But I feel that, even now, people get
into arguments:

53
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,620
if I say, “No, this won’t work out.
That’s not good,”

54
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:52,187
I have to spend at least four, five hours

55
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:55,339
going round and round and bringing
the point to the heads of people that,

56
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,592
“No, that’s not good, that won’t help you.”

57
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:03,357
But once I asked him, “How is it you are
so obedient?”

58
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,657
I mean, whatever I say just he gets a hint,
he’ll agree.

59
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:11,731
He said, “Mother, I once learned a lesson:
that’s my own marriage.

60
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:15,958
And You didn’t say no, but You did say
to me that,

61
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:20,411
‘If it makes you happy.’ You didn’t say,
‘It will make you joyous,’

62
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:21,944
and I have learned a lesson from that.”

63
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:26,383
But we don’t learn our lessons is [what]
the point is.

64
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:33,842
We don’t learn our lessons. We argue:

65
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,525
that comes from ego.

66
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:44,614
If we have superego we, we make others mad!

67
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:48,443
Like somebody came from America and mean,
he was just mad

68
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:54,031
that he must come and see me. And I’m
so busy, I have no time, you know that.

69
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:56,524
I have to correct this book, I have
to correct that book.

70
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:59,806
Now we have to do this Advent, and that
is to be done.

71
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:05,822
I have to look after my household, and
this and that. I am so busy.

72
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:10,126
But the person really made them mad, that
he must see me!

73
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:13,410
Now if you come from America, that doesn’t
mean that you must see me,

74
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:17,188
because you never took time with me. I am
busy here now.

75
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:24,243
When I went to America, it’s all right;
which is true.

76
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,896
And we do not realise that what we are
doing [is]

77
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,875
that we don’t love Mother, we don’t love
Her.

78
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:37,830
We think of our needs, our impressions,
our talking, it’s a fact.

79
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:43,114
Like somebody I asked, “All right you
speak, you are a good speaker.”

80
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:45,636
All right, the person starts speaking,

81
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:49,882
and he becomes egoistical. How can you be?

82
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:55,984
If you just start giving a good speech, you
become egoistical.

83
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,395
Somebody made good photographs, so I said,
“These are good photographs.”

84
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:01,846
He becomes egoistical! You cannot praise
anyone in this country —

85
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,640
it’s the worst thing. He says, “Agnya
is clear.”

86
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:07,480
I don’t know what sort of an Agnya is clear
here!

87
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,974
You cannot praise. I mean I try to be nice.

88
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:14,695
I say, “Oh, your photographs are very nice.”
Immediately the person becomes egoistical.

89
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:18,669
You give some work to someone, “All right
you do this work, postering.”

90
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,718
Somebody is doing postering: his ego
goes up!

91
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,807
What is this? Like a balloon?

92
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:28,370
There’s no depth. There’s no gravity.

93
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:31,272
Now why? This is the question.

94
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:35,702
He asked me many a times, “Why it
happens, Mother?”

95
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,716
The reason is — I told them the other day,
I think they have a tape on this;

96
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:43,047
you can go through that — but a simple
thing is that,

97
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:49,517
that we have lived a superficial life here.
We are superficial people.

98
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:55,205
Because the society is such, this machine
has made us like this,

99
00:08:55,406 --> 00:08:58,522
and we have read books. We have
pampered egos.

100
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:03,468
Our forefathers went and fought in other
countries thinking no end of themselves.

101
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:08,226
Then we had this war. With the war we
became also nonsensical,

102
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:12,041
either aggressive, or we have become with
superego. We have bhoots.

103
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,668
We have conditionings. All these things
are there.

104
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:20,285
We are not our genuine Self, it’s the
point.

105
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:25,650
So, I think the being that is going to be
enlightened by your Spirit

106
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:29,133
is covered with ego, and on top of that,

107
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,835
is a sheen of that superficial being that
you have.

108
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:37,872
So, “Mother says”. All right. “Mother did
this” All right:

109
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:43,225
nothing goes inside I feel. There’s no
love.

110
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:49,669
If you are in love with someone, even if
the person is in that vicinity anywhere…

111
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,284
you know Mother is in London, just think,
“Mother is in London.”

112
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:56,094
Just think! If you love me, just think.

113
00:09:56,295 --> 00:10:00,360
What a happy thought it is:

114
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:07,521
“She’s in England!” It’s a happy thought.

115
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:12,533
Think on those lines. But it does not
work out

116
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:17,190
because that genuine thing that is inside,

117
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:22,591
is covered with ego or superego, your
bhoots are in between.

118
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:28,084
So, what happens [is] that you live with
that superficial nonsense.

119
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:33,557
Nothing goes inside. It’s all that level.

120
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:36,636
You ask anyone, they’ll say, “I’m
all right.

121
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:41,360
I’m like this, I’m like that.” [not very
well] Why?

122
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:45,463
Nothing goes inside, why?

123
00:10:45,664 --> 00:10:48,646
Because, the genuine Self is lost.

124
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:53,555
What is going to enlighten you? It’s not
your artificial thing.

125
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:59,342
You know artificial fibre, if you have
artificial fibre,

126
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:02,745
it doesn’t penetrate anything.

127
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:07,743
It can penetrate into everything, but
nothing can penetrate into it.

128
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:14,226
Like that, that artificial thing on us,
and we live with it, all the time.

129
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:18,611
Now why he said about Maharashtra?
Because Maharashtrians

130
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,711
are not exposed to artificiality, they
don’t know what is artificiality.

131
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:26,580
People think they are stupid, they are
foolish, they are no good for business,

132
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,926
they are not good for this, they are not
good for that.

133
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:34,787
But the main thing is that their genuine
being is not covered with any nonsenses:

134
00:11:34,988 --> 00:11:37,530
“I am something!”

135
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,900
I have never seen Warren feeling that way,
and that’s something surprising.

136
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:46,554
I have never seen him feeling that he’s
important,

137
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:52,450
that he should be near me, he should be
in my company — never!

138
00:11:52,760 --> 00:12:00,184
Never even I have heard him anywhere
around. I have to call for him.

139
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:04,837
Unless and until I call him, he’ll never
come before me.

140
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:09,920
He wants to see if I need him, otherwise
he’s not bothered.

141
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:19,173
He just feels that I’m around, “Mother
is somewhere.”

142
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:21,108
Unless and until [I call him]. But if I
tell him,

143
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,854
“Warren, I want…” wherever he may be,

144
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,597
he’ll just rush and come. It’s a very good
example for you.

145
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,901
I am happy there are some examples
of this kind.

146
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:32,278
There are many others; I am not saying
it’s only Warren.

147
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:39,959
And then, if you take up any responsibility
in Sahaj Yoga,

148
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,675
then you start thinking you are great,
you are a great Sahaj Yogi:

149
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,823
you have done this, you have put
the postering, you have done this.

150
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:51,869
This shows the calibre, shows the calibre.

151
00:12:54,304 --> 00:13:01,125
People from absolutely dead conditions
have risen so high,

152
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:04,349
and while people from quite normal
conditions are nowhere there,

153
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,290
just they are just there, why?
(The) Calibre.

154
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,635
Now everybody has that calibre. What
I am trying to say:

155
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:13,815
every one of us have the calibre.

156
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:24,039
But it is not evident in everyone because
the amount of covering they have

157
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:30,657
Everybody has capacity to love, everyone
has capacity.

158
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:38,170
But if you have covered yourself completely
with artificiality you cannot love.

159
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:42,054
Now if you ask me, “Mother, how to love?”
what am I to tell you?

160
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:49,311
I love you, no doubt. I love all of you.
I love you very much.

161
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,139
I am bothered about you. But what I find
then,

162
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,066
when I am bothered about somebody, that
person starts taking advantage.

163
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:01,439
I don’t mind [if you] take advantage,
but by taking advantage

164
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,115
that person goes down completely.

165
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:10,603
If I am bothered about something,

166
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:16,038
then [that] one immediately starts thinking
they are very important,

167
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,273
that, “Mother is so much bothered about
me!”

168
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:25,093
Now try to understand that this is
a country

169
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:29,956
which is my heart, is my heart itself.

170
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:37,688
And Sahasrara is nothing else but it’s
heart.

171
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:43,050
Have you noticed how it is nicely managed
already

172
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:49,700
that, if Kundalini has to break, it has
to break through the heart chakra?

173
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:55,414
If your heart is not all right, it cannot
break, your Kundalini at Sahasrara.

174
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,544
Have you seen that?

175
00:14:57,745 --> 00:15:07,163
That the Brahmarandhra, the last opening,
is on the heart chakra.

176
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:13,024
I know everyone very well.

177
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:17,667
There are people who are mediums with us.
I know that.

178
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:21,560
But they don’t know they’ll go to Hell.

179
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:26,071
It’s a very dangerous time you are in —
be careful!

180
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:30,234
And that makes me feel even worse when
I think that they don’t know

181
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:40,962
on what horrible times your feet are
dangling.

182
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,959
So don’t play games!

183
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,019
I know English language has its own styles
and things,

184
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,795
English mannerism has its own ways,
methods.

185
00:15:56,996 --> 00:16:00,720
Forget that you are English!

186
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:07,560
That’s the best way.

187
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:15,139
English think that, “We are different
people.

188
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,627
We are of the heart you see — great
people!”

189
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:24,046
In Italy I told one journalist lady who had
come, very good lady.

190
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:27,376
She said, “Mother, one thing I didn’t like
the sentence you said

191
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:31,324
that, ‘England is the heart.’ Agh,

192
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:37,996
how can it be? Horrible?” She couldn’t
believe it.

193
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,996
She said, “Only because You said I
tolerate it,

194
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:44,089
but anybody else saying it I would not
tolerate!”

195
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,551
So how far we have gone down as English,

196
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,604
you must see the reputation of English
abroad.

197
00:16:55,965 --> 00:17:02,936
And advancement we have made is to reach
the status of punk rocks!

198
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,055
So when there is such a situation in
a country,

199
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:13,370
how serious we have to be about it.

200
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,715
Because this country is going to save
the world or is going to mar the world,

201
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:24,230
because it is at the Sahasrara. Where
Mother is to be accepted.

202
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,275
Whether Mother is to be settled and
worshipped and adored.

203
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:37,782
But do we have that seriousness
of understanding

204
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:42,281
that we are born at a time when
the responsibility is much more on us?

205
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:44,654
We don’t realise that we are born
in the heart, means

206
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:49,676
our responsibility is much, much more
than other people have.

207
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:56,906
On the contrary, “We are born on the heart,
so we are great people!” — finished!

208
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:08,379
There are certain things which you follow,
simple things, is going to help you.

209
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,901
The other day I met somebody who had
a nonsensical thing like a Hamsa [catch].

210
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:18,634
I said, “Hamsa, how can you have? Are
you putting oil everyday?

211
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:23,688
Are you putting ghee everyday?” He said,
“No!” I said, “Why?

212
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:29,330
Is a simple thing like that, why don’t you
do everyday?”

213
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:35,265
“Mother is here. She’ll look after us.”

214
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,684
The responsibility is not felt because
there’s no seriousness about it!

215
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,831
You don’t know!

216
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:51,569
The job is great, you can do it, you have
the calibre.

217
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,331
Face yourself up, every one of you.

218
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:58,393
It’s not facing others. face yourself up!

219
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:02,468
And I find, really I must say Italians,

220
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:09,937
really I must say what Warren says,
is true, it’s true.

221
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:16,148
We have Antonio with us in the house,
I see:

222
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:21,998
He’s very different from all other English
people.

223
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:28,827
He’s very different. He’s so balanced,
he’s so much there.

224
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:31,970
Then, then there are some people, funny
people,

225
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,024
I have seen, they have been with us,
so far, so:

226
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:37,134
They will go and do this course, they will
go to this, that.

227
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,482
It’s nonsense going on all the time!

228
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:42,890
And one person like that can spoil all
of them.

229
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:47,856
We have so many stupid people on the
periphery in Sahaj Yoga in England.

230
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:51,252
We do not have so many numbers anywhere
else on the periphery.

231
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:56,969
We have tremendous people, as well as some
people who are really horrid.

232
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,561
I was trying to make a black list
everywhere,

233
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:07,482
and we had the maximum number in
England! Maximum number in England.

234
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:13,789
Now when I am going and leaving you here,

235
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,103
you see my heart wrenches really sometimes,

236
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:22,044
because I know you are not yet matured
enough. But why not mature?

237
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,159
Because there’s no seriousness about it.

238
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:32,729
Then they will come, “We need a leader,
somebody.” Why?

239
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,406
Why do you want somebody to hit you
on your head all the time,

240
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:41,493
to tell you things like that? With your own
dignity, why not come up?

241
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,541
Now I am going, you all have to work it
out.

242
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:53,689
So when you go to India, even Indians
say that English are the worst.

243
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:56,270
There’s the certificate.

244
00:20:56,471 --> 00:21:03,152
And you have to be the best people, better
than even Australians!

245
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:06,609
That’s so simple.

246
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,776
Because now we are at Sahasrara,
working at Sahasrara.

247
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:14,423
Do you see? Why I have to say all these
things?

248
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:20,773
Because you are born, you are born
in this country.

249
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:26,776
You are the people.

250
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:30,039
But whatever I say is, “Mother speaks
very well.

251
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,663
Let’s have a tape. All right, very nice
to hear!

252
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:38,441
It’s a great entertainment you know,
Mother is talking! She talks very well.”

253
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:40,971
[But] it doesn’t go inside, anything!
It doesn’t go.

254
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:47,262
It’s like a plastic on top, complete
plastic cover.

255
00:21:53,003 --> 00:22:01,388
So, one has to learn certain things, a few
things are, like Vishuddhi Chakra:

256
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,779
now English don’t talk, but they move
their heads too much.

257
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,570
If they say yes, they’ll go on saying yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

258
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:15,813
All the time their necks are moving.
I mean they have long necks,

259
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:22,727
and they must go on moving their necks
all the time. There’s no need.

260
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:28,424
Why to bend your neck so much?

261
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:33,237
Even if they say something, “Yes, yes,
yes, yes.”

262
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:36,943
Like they’ll say, “Today’s programme
went very well.”

263
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:41,372
“Yes, yes, yes!” Themselves certifying it.

264
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:46,431
But they don’t see, because they don’t
want to see it,

265
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:49,622
that’s Vishuddhi Chakra.

266
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:53,379
You don’t talk, because when you talk,
horrible things come out,

267
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,852
so you’re so afraid of talking that you
just don’t talk.

268
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,449
But talk to yourself on the mirror, talk
to yourself.

269
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:07,773
See how you can respect, how you can be
kind, how you could be nice.

270
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:11,770
But no, the practice is more of sarcasm,

271
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:17,380
more of saying harsh things, horrible
things,

272
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:20,623
and that’s it.

273
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:25,682
It should have, I know is a flair, it
should have a beautiful thing.

274
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:33,540
It should not be serious sermon, no.
But say something sweet and nice.

275
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:41,286
It’s so evident when I say something sweet.

276
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:52,263
Like the other day, we were in France,
and I asked Guido,

277
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,337
“You’d better speak in Italian and
somebody should translate you.”

278
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:59,364
On the way I was just thinking, “Who
will translate Guido,

279
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:08,499
because somebody who knows French and
Italian well, who will do that?”

280
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,999
And when I entered the hall I saw Ruth,
you see, standing there with her.

281
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,839
I had not seen her. I didn’t know she
was there. She had come all the way.

282
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,365
And all the way she’s run from there,

283
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:26,418
and now she’s holding in her hand this mic,
and she is holding fort.

284
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:32,006
 You know, my heart became so large,
and I really felt like embracing her.

285
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:37,379
And the eyes you see, spoke what I felt.

286
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,551
The way she came round you see, she was
there.

287
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:45,436
I was worried who will translate and there
she was.

288
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:48,099
You see, I also get help like this,

289
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,994
when people love me I know I get help.

290
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:57,280
But if they don’t love me there are
obstructions, problems, this, that.

291
00:24:57,481 --> 00:25:03,642
All nonsense -  you get so fed up you don’t
want to see them, sometimes it happens.

292
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:07,334
But if there is love, you know the whole
communication works through love,

293
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:11,590
this subtle love. The whole ether has got
this subtler love,

294
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,795
every matter has got this subtler love,
everything has.

295
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:19,404
And the whole thing goes into waves and
you just get the message.

296
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,255
But if you are not on that reception point

297
00:25:22,456 --> 00:25:27,838
or if you are not there nothing works:
neither you nor me.

298
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:33,286
It’s a mutual thing. I help you, but you
help me too. What’s me is you.

299
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:37,667
But you are not at that level because you
are on superficiality.

300
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:42,316
And because of this superficiality, also,
you are not collective.

301
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:47,594
But the sense of collectivity is very, very
tricky also, one must understand.

302
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:53,138
Some people start forming groups and they
think they have been collective.

303
00:25:55,448 --> 00:26:02,450
Forming a group is a sign of most
uncollective behaviour.

304
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:04,904
But they think, “We have been very
collective,

305
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,990
we have been very nice, you see!”
Very happy people!

306
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:17,864
So what I have to tell you is that you
[should] understand your responsibility.

307
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:25,127
You are in the head office, in the head
office.

308
00:26:26,674 --> 00:26:28,469
And the people who are not in the head
office

309
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,863
are doing much, much better than you.

310
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:38,657
Then the whole office has to collapse.

311
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:48,300
Suddenly I hear a news that somebody
is fighting with someone.

312
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:55,747
Again he is gone back to his normal self.
Only in England.

313
00:26:57,196 --> 00:27:02,957
He gets re-possessed. Again he is left out,
again he is re-possessed.

314
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:08,712
Again he is clearer, again he is
re-possessed.

315
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:16,041
Because there is no seriousness about it.

316
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:27,190
The faith that is serious gives you awe.

317
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:34,374
It gives you a feeling of joy, but there
is awe.

318
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,522
You love that awe, enjoy that awe.

319
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:48,407
Mother is around. What are we doing?
Where are we?

320
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:55,481
And that’s the first sign, that’s the first
sign, that you are realising

321
00:27:55,704 --> 00:28:00,250
who is your Mother — first sign is.

322
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,985
It is very easy just to jump into it,

323
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:13,455
just like your Kundalini awakening,
I can tell you.

324
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:20,400
And Americans you know are speedy people.

325
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:27,323
I knew if they start, they have to just
start, that’s the point. I know that.

326
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:31,376
Americans have to just start, and they’ll
shoot off,

327
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:34,680
and they shoot off very fast. They have
speed.

328
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:43,513
If they take the speed you must know
what they are capable of.

329
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:46,264
There’s another one that’s coming up
very well,

330
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:51,514
which I must tell you, is Munich. I didn’t
want to go there.

331
00:28:51,715 --> 00:28:57,171
There was a Polish, stupid, woman, she told
me all wrong about Munich people.

332
00:28:57,372 --> 00:29:00,604
So I thought, “If this is the sample, I’d
better not go.”

333
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:05,529
Then I felt the vibrations: and tremendous
vibrations!

334
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,702
And the seriousness with which they were
hearing me, the intensity,

335
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:14,486
as if there was a mathematical class
or some sort of a science class

336
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:20,984
I was talking about, with complete
attention, not even blinking

337
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:29,768
Absolute absorption of every word I was
saying.

338
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,346
I was amazed at these people.

339
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:38,058
And once the Germans get to Sahaj Yoga,
God save you all!

340
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:42,842
I can assure you, you cannot come up
to their levels,

341
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,762
because they have built up themselves
like that.

342
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:50,386
They are built up people. They are people
of discipline.

343
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:56,064
And when they will come to Sahaj Yoga
you will see what will happen.

344
00:29:56,265 --> 00:30:03,430
So all this lovey-dovey business, and this
kind of a what you call this,

345
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,291
I don’t know in English word what you call.
Sahaj Yogi: Wishy-washy.

346
00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:08,006
Shri Mataji: Wishy-washy is different.
What I am saying is a person

347
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,156
who is neither here nor there: all the time
bending like this.

348
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:15,620
Lecha-pecha as we call in Hindi language.

349
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:22,169
And also telling me, “I am like this!”
All this nonsense!

350
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:26,393
How many will be left out? I don’t know.

351
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:34,586
So, if I say anything, just know that
I know what it is.

352
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,050
I know what is going to happen.

353
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:43,084
But you won’t learn your lessons, I know.

354
00:30:43,285 --> 00:30:48,811
If I told somebody, “Don’t. Go back!”
or, “Stay back!”

355
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:53,756
that person learns ultimately that, “This
was the thing, correct. Mother said it.”

356
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:58,422
But how many times? It is the point now.

357
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,434
So now, I am going away.

358
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:11,569
I want to tell you that we all have to be
serious people.

359
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,003
Whatever mistakes you have committed,
forget it.

360
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:21,427
Be serious people! Those who are
egoistical, trying to form groups,

361
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:24,338
are mediums like, they talk like stupid
people,

362
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:28,396
trying to organise programmes in a stupid
way,

363
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:34,649
giving big lectures, should come down
to normal now! Nothing doing!

364
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:41,345
Be serious! We have to be alert.

365
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:48,164
Those who will sleep now will lose
completely.

366
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,009
I must warn you. It’s important. Time
is short.

367
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,514
You are important people, no doubt
about it.

368
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:05,571
But if you are no good, you will be losing
your position completely.

369
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:16,803
The day when I am thinking of going
to India - for a Mother,

370
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:22,642
she’s more worried about people who are
still not there. She is always worried.

371
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:25,201
It’s like a boat is going.

372
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:30,968
I’ve got many people in the boat quite
settled down, even from England.

373
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:37,113
But there are many still halfway in the
water, you see, coming up, going down.

374
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:39,199
You are not worried about the people who
are on the boat,

375
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,205
but you are worried about the people
who are still halfway.

376
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:49,339
And that worry is on my head.

377
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:55,458
I am serious. The climate is serious.
The weather is serious.

378
00:32:55,664 --> 00:32:59,930
How it rained and rained and rained today!

379
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:06,770
The whole nature is bothered.

380
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:14,110
Don’t think that only if you are educated,
uneducated,

381
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:17,601
you come from this sort of a life or that -
that’s nothing important,

382
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:21,656
Spirit is above all these things.

383
00:33:21,857 --> 00:33:27,795
But to make the Spirit shine, you see,
to work on your nerves,

384
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:33,591
that sheen [of superficiality] has to go
away, otherwise it will never work.

385
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:44,406
Whatever you do, it should please me,
it’s one of the ways. It should please me.

386
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:52,422
That’s one of the signs. So how do we
do it?

387
00:33:52,623 --> 00:33:58,251
Put me in your heart! Just try to put me
in your heart, it’s very simple.

388
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:03,465
I am before you now. I am in person.

389
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,769
I was trying to give Realisation to one
of my relations just today.

390
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,700
And I said that, “You don’t close your
eyes.”

391
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:17,066
He said, “No, I’m not looking at your face

392
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:21,978
because when I see you, I feel you are
my aunt.

393
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:27,260
But I am just looking at your feet so that
I shouldn’t feel anymore

394
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:31,257
that you are my aunt. You are very great.

395
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:35,544
And your face is the one that puts me
into illusions.”

396
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:40,156
He could see it’s a Mahamaya. He said,
“Only at your feet I look.

397
00:34:40,357 --> 00:34:45,524
And through your feet only I can get over
this barrier, this feeling.”

398
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:52,443
In the same way when I am a Mahamaya,
I know I am, I had to be.

399
00:34:54,814 --> 00:35:02,469
But you have to put my feet into your
heart.

400
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:13,419
Just my feet into your heart.

401
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:21,278
Because photo, face, everything might be
an illusion.

402
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:31,217
Might be by seeing my face, you do not get
over your barriers.

403
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:39,478
To say, “I must see Mother.” “I must
do this.”

404
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,538
“Mother must come to my house.” “She must
have food at my place.”

405
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:46,826
“She must visit my home.” All this is
so stupid,

406
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:51,548
I cannot understand what’s the matter
with these people!

407
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:59,014
Mother, please come in my heart.

408
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:02,200
Let me clean my heart so that you are
there.

409
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:06,396
Put your feet into my heart.

410
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:12,713
Let your feet be worshipped in my heart.

411
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:16,845
Let me not be in delusion.

412
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,484
Take me away from illusions.

413
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:23,169
Keep me in reality.

414
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,251
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

415
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:32,280
Let me enjoy your feet in my heart.

416
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:37,216
Let me see your feet in my heart.

417
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,054
Only such people.

418
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:44,658
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha have
done that.

419
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:48,512
So don’t you think you have to do it?

420
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,646
So humble down yourself!

421
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:57,622
Humble down yourself in your heart.

422
00:36:57,823 --> 00:36:59,891
Humble down in your heart.

423
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:04,473
Enjoy your humility. Enjoy your virtues.

424
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:09,861
The greatest virtue of a Sahaj Yogi
is humility.

425
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:16,286
Now, so many things you have seen
to convince you.

426
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:21,872
But in no way it can mean any kind
of subjection,

427
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:27,364
because what subjection you can give me?
Think of that.

428
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:35,396
When every subjection is a blessing,
what subjection you are giving me?

429
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:41,023
Every feeling in the heart is a blessing.

430
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:50,222
Just now you feel it and you feel the joy,
in your heart.

431
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,528
Then what is your subjection? About what?

432
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:59,358
I can understand people who are just newly
come, who are good for nothing.

433
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,946
But you are not on the periphery.

434
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:05,763
But some of them do go into periphery
in no time.

435
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:10,212
You give them some work — finished!
If I am sweet to someone — finished!

436
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,792
If I see someone — finished! I mean,
this is too much.

437
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:17,736
I can’t even be nice to you.

438
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:32,168
If you do any mistakes or anything, then
you get your left Vishuddhi.

439
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:35,124
You’ve done your mistake, all right,
finish it.

440
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:38,112
You love me. Maybe there’s something
wrong in the love

441
00:38:38,313 --> 00:38:40,109
or maybe something has happened,
doesn’t matter.

442
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:46,511
“Now, I’m going to be cautious. I’m not
going to make any mistakes.

443
00:38:46,712 --> 00:38:51,332
How could I do this mistake? Because
I was not fully in love.

444
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,670
If I had loved something, I would have
not done such a mistake!”

445
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:58,752
All right, so develop your love.
No. you will do,

446
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:03,379
“I feel guilty because I have done
such a thing.”

447
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:09,511
So you miss this and that both. So your
mistake becomes a barrier again.

448
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:12,755
Don’t feel guilty about it. We have
to progress further.

449
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:15,329
Forget the past. Forget the past. Forget
the past.

450
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,086
We have to go further. We have to be
serious people.

451
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:27,944
When we talk, we should talk with that
dignity of that awe.

452
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:32,670
That’s very important

453
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:38,057
and once you develop that awe your
Ekadasha will disappear.

454
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:45,343
Ekadasha will disappear. Just think
of the awe.

455
00:39:54,249 --> 00:40:02,098
See the silence and the joy, and the joy
of the awe

456
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:06,611
is deep, very deep, like a sea.

457
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:10,043
(The) sea on superficial level is very
turbulent,

458
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:14,570
but inside is silent, absolutely silent.

459
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:21,175
Feel that depth. Without awe, you cannot
go down.

460
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:31,917
I have sometimes even said little loudly
some things to Warren, I know,

461
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:36,634
but it’s never, never felt with him. But
with some people I have never said

462
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:41,722
because I know the person won’t take it
from me.

463
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:51,938
But he never feels that I have said
anything wrong or to hurt him in any way,

464
00:40:55,588 --> 00:41:00,072
that’s the sign of complete awe.

465
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,488
And it’s just a wee bit of penetration,

466
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:15,394
a very little bit of penetration
[that’s needed].

467
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:21,229
Forget the self-importance. Forget the
greatness that you think about yourself.

468
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:28,872
When you become the zero then you become
the Mother.

469
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:36,379
As long as you are like a cup, you are
small.

470
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:41,689
When the boundaries of the cups are broken,
there’s no more a cup.

471
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:47,226
And this is what today I have to tell you.

472
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:56,085
Today is the eleventh day and ten days,

473
00:41:56,744 --> 00:42:01,531
out of which nine days were the periods
of fights.

474
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:05,528
Tenth day is the period of victory.

475
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:10,154
Now eleventh day is of enjoyment.

476
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:18,338
But how can the people who do not have
the awe, enjoy? I cannot understand.

477
00:42:21,023 --> 00:42:27,881
Because Ekadasha forms the barrier.

478
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:32,400
And the barrier of Ekadasha, you know
what it is.

479
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:42,029
Feel the awe and you’ll go deep into your
heart, deep into your heart.

480
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:49,910
Because you are at a point where just you
have to have the gravity to go down.

481
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:56,672
[It’s] working out: try to keep that.

482
00:42:58,195 --> 00:43:01,811
Slowly and slowly you all have come up
to a point;

483
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:08,329
only thing is now develop your depth.
Go deep down.

484
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:10,758
I know there are frivolous people

485
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:15,659
but they’ll all be dropped out in no time.
Don’t worry about them.

486
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,575
I know what people are doing, how they
are behaving.

487
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:25,536
I know every one of you very well,
each one of you.

488
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:31,533
So, respect your body, respect yourself,

489
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,912
keep your hamsas all right at least.

490
00:43:37,596 --> 00:43:42,258
And I am sure, if you become serious
about it…

491
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:47,243
you need a serious understanding of the
whole thing, that’s what is lacking.

492
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:50,070
Because if you love someone,

493
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:54,685
the whole thing becomes an entire
possession sort of thing,

494
00:43:54,886 --> 00:43:58,910
the entire being is so seriously involved
into it

495
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:04,499
that you cannot afford to miss anything.

496
00:44:04,705 --> 00:44:09,376
And that’s what is going to help you.

497
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:18,537
But seriousness never means you are
not enjoying.

498
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:26,311
Enjoyment is so deep: it’s pouring into
the heart.

499
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:32,868
I play with you. I always try to say things
that will please you.

500
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:36,666
And it should please you much more that
I have said — what today is that —

501
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:42,977
how to reach your depths, to reach that
gravity

502
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:45,752
that will make you the gurus.

503
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:50,800
Today I had to talk to you like a guru,
because I feel

504
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:58,731
that now the time has come for all of you
to become gurus of the right type.

505
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:08,175
Not with egos or talking big and creating
a big sort of a show out of you.

506
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:13,252
But a definite depth within you

507
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:18,767
that people see that, “Here is a beacon
of Mother.”

508
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:26,526
And it is so fantastic!

509
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:32,202
The whole thing is so great, to be that.

510
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:36,229
This is what the gurus used to do,
first of all,

511
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,003
is to cleanse people, clear them out, take
out their barriers,

512
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:47,026
make them take out their egos, by hanging
them round, putting them on top of a well,

513
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:50,108
putting them down five, six times, dipping
them down.

514
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:53,835
They used to do all this for what?

515
00:45:54,512 --> 00:46:01,139
But now you can do it because I am before
you!

516
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:11,061
Because I have come.

517
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:26,483
This is the reason. Understand what Warren
has, so rightly, said.

518
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:32,336
You might say that “Mother was working
through him.” Maybe.

519
00:46:33,153 --> 00:46:37,808
But, I always work through you if you are
one with me.

520
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:41,703
Even when I am speaking, you are speaking.

521
00:46:41,904 --> 00:46:47,909
And when you are speaking, I am speaking.
You know that.

522
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:56,355
But with all this, that awe is very
important.

523
00:47:02,996 --> 00:47:10,222
And that gives you the love that thinks:

524
00:47:12,008 --> 00:47:17,986
complete integration of your heart and
your brain.

525
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:22,793
The love that thinks is thoughtful,
the love that thinks.

526
00:47:22,994 --> 00:47:29,215
And then the third integration: the love
that acts.

527
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:37,355
But first this integration must be brought
in: the love that thinks,

528
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:47,401
which understands, which feels.

529
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:53,147
And then the love that acts.

530
00:47:55,802 --> 00:48:02,101
But the basic is the love — it starts from
the heart — is the love.

531
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:26,113
I think you’d better take my tape today
and listen to it.

532
00:48:26,314 --> 00:48:31,871
Meditate. Meditate on that.

533
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:41,469
I want to see my children in England
develop the depth

534
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:51,931
in language, in speech, in feelings,
in expressions, in the personality.

535
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:57,745
It’s only the awe that will make it.

536
00:48:57,946 --> 00:49:01,784
But awe which is not frightening, but awe
that’s joy-giving.

537
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:05,215
This is the integration of it.

538
00:49:05,668 --> 00:49:14,813
Awe that is joy-giving, is not frightening.

539
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:19,157
Open your hearts!

540
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,059
But it doesn’t mean you should be
frivolous, [but] with all the care.

541
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,952
Have you seen a lotus opening? How
beautifully it opens:

542
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:37,143
slowly, every petal so careful not to hit
each other. Slowly it opens out.

543
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:45,481
And then the fragrance starts pouring
in the most dignified manner.

544
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:53,258
Such a flower only can be offered at the
Lotus feet of the Adi Shakti, isn’t it?

545
00:49:57,215 --> 00:50:00,384
May God bless you.

546
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:17,211
May God bless you.
