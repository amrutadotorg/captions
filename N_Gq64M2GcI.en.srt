1
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:56,890
So we have decided, we have decided to have
the puja after our dinner because Shri Krishna

2
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:07,360
was born in the night, about twelve o’clock
while I was born twelve o’clock in the daytime,

3
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,720
same with Shri Rama.

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:24,040
And also Christ was born twelve o’clock
in the night.

5
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:37,520
I’ve told you that today I’m going to
tell you about Gita.

6
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,100
That is the second part of Krishna’s life.

7
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:51,720
So different and varied that some people,
intellectuals as usual, say that the Krishna

8
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:05,580
who played as a child in Gokul was different
from the Krishna who was the king of Dwarika.

9
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:18,780
So when He became the king of Dwarika there
was a war between Pandavas and Kauravas, one

10
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:27,360
representing the good people, another representing
the bad people.

11
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:36,560
So they came to ask Him if He would join on
their side.

12
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:46,630
So He said, “I’ve got My army and I Myself,
so whichever you choose you can have.”

13
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:54,840
So Kauravas said, “We’ll have your army,”
but Pandavas said, “We’ll have you.”

14
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:11,220
And that is how the war started and in the
war His greatest disciple was one of 

15
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,220
the Pandavas called Arjuna.

16
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,460
And Arjuna asked Him to fight for him.

17
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:23,650
He said, “I will not take any weapon in
my hand but I will be your charioteer and

18
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,690
drive your chariot.”

19
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:43,420
And when He was driving the chariot it so
happened that 

20
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,990
Krishna saw Arjuna’s depression.

21
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:54,350
And Arjuna said, “What is this war?

22
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,400
Why should I fight?

23
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:07,530
I’m fighting my own gurus, those who have
taught me all the vidyas of the battleship,

24
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:24,400
battle, and also the vidya of archery and
I’m fighting my own cousins.”

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:32,970
So Shri Krishna said that, “They’re already
killed, they don’t exist, they’re already

26
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:42,590
dead people, because they’re not realized
souls, I’ve already killed them.

27
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:51,900
So you have to just play this drama of killing
them.”

28
00:04:51,900 --> 00:05:00,290
So the foremost contradiction that people
present about Gita is that those who read

29
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,760
Gita should be vegetarian.

30
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,850
Krishna told, Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,
“You kill them.”

31
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:19,400
Human beings, his own relations, his own cousins
who were bad people.

32
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,490
What about chickens and goats?

33
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:35,699
But all those who start reading Gita in India
give up all meat eating and take to vegetarianism,

34
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,770
or they fast.

35
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,340
So how contradictory these things are.

36
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,850
So He never preached vegetarianism, at least
in Gita.

37
00:05:45,850 --> 00:06:02,210
And He asked Arjuna to kill.

38
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,620
In the modern times there is a war going on
between the evil force and the good.

39
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:17,150
You don’t have to kill them; even if you
give them bandhan they’re already dead,

40
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,700
they’re not realized souls, they’ll be
all neutralized.

41
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:29,000
But you have to kill them in the sense you’ve
to kill your connections with them.

42
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Like I see many people who come to Sahaja
Yoga, “But my mother is not yet a Sahaja

43
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,750
Yogini, so she troubles me, how can I do Sahaja
Yoga?”

44
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,520
For anything else they’ll fight the mother
but not for this.

45
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,979
“Kill your attachments and your relations.”

46
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:58,490
That’s what He said, if in case they are
troubling you in your ascent.

47
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:07,180
This is the message of Gita to begin with.

48
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:17,710
But on the contrary I’ve seen there are
people in Sahaja Yoga who once they get married

49
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,300
want to get out of Sahaja Yoga, take out their
husbands or take out their wives or want to

50
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:32,990
live away and want to be non-collective.

51
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,230
So you have to kill.

52
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:42,740
There are <Sanskrit word>, there are six enemies
human beings have but in the modern times

53
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:50,150
they have multiplied, I think.

54
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:57,500
The first one is the lust.

55
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,840
Kill your lust.

56
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:10,699
The lust that is today finishing the West
more than the greed.

57
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,270
So first is to kill your lust.

58
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:25,090
Then kill your anger.

59
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:32,020
There are certain people who have a built-in
response that as soon as they see somebody

60
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,210
they get into anger.

61
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,459
If a white man sees a black man he gets into
an anger, a black man sees a white man he

62
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,229
gets into anger, surprising.

63
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:52,680
I mean, God has made all kinds of things;
the life would be boring if you all have the

64
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,100
same parched skins, all of you looking the
same.

65
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,420
So he has made different types of beautiful
people.

66
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:08,160
But this anger can come from any source.

67
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,040
This is what it is when you kill anger, actually
you kill all your connections with the past,

68
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:25,360
the responses, the conditionings you have
had.

69
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:39,350
Then the vanity that people have; I find it
much more when I go to places where people

70
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:52,779
call themselves bureaucrats or they’re “in
charge,” like matrons telling people what

71
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,939
to do, “Do this, do that, do that.”

72
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:58,411
This is the Krishna’s finger, using Krishna’s
finger on others.

73
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:10,170
The vanity, the vanity that you are perfect,
you are perfect, “Nothing wrong with me.”

74
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:18,269
You are the best people, English think they’re
the best, Germans think they’re the best,

75
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:28,440
Italians think they’re the best, or, say,
the best of all are the Switzerland, Swiss

76
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,389
people.

77
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:43,199
This vanity, this forge, has to be cut up.

78
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:47,899
What have you achieved by being a certain
nation, let us see.

79
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:54,180
What have you contributed, belonging to a
certain country.

80
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,879
Those who only belong to the Kingdom of God
have achieved something.

81
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:09,339
The rest of them are useless people, just
finding some way to fight each other, to denounce

82
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:15,639
others and vanity is just like a balloon.

83
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:24,610
If somebody just puts a pin into it the whole
balloon will collapse.

84
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:32,319
Now the worst of all is jealousy, and that
is among Indians, Indians are very big jealous

85
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:34,079
pots.

86
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,050
Specially the Indians who are again in the
government and the politics but otherwise

87
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,079
also there are jealousies.

88
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,439
They’ll always complain about the other
people and will be jealous.

89
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:56,509
And also in the West people are quite jealous,
I must say.

90
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:07,129
They’re jealous of things which is most
surprising.

91
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:16,360
One day I was going in the car and one gentleman
was very furious for nothing.

92
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,629
So the another one tells Me, “They’re
jealous because you’re sitting in a Mercedes

93
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:22,629
car.”

94
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,629
I said, “But it’s not Mine, that’s My
husband’s, you see.”

95
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,819
What is there to be jealous because I’m
sitting in a Mercedes car.

96
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:37,510
I mean, this is being a very stupid, nonsensical
thing but still I can’t believe you can

97
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:44,999
be jealous of somebody because he has a Mercedes
car, what does it matter?

98
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:53,069
To Me, it’s a foreign idea absolutely, I
can’t understand.

99
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:56,790
But there are stupid and stupid things like
that.

100
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:15,010
I can only understand one jealousy, that is
between husband and wife, little bit.

101
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,910
<Laughter>

102
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:34,180
Then the fifth thing that He asked us to kill
is the attachment, very important, “This

103
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,160
is my child, this is my…”

104
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,790
This is Indian also, more Indian, “This
is my cousin, this is my brother, this is

105
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,269
my fiancé, this is my wife.”

106
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:54,129
Also in the West, the other way round is that
they do not care for their children.

107
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,610
They do not care for their mothers, they do
not care for their fathers.

108
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:06,589
They do not care for anyone whatsoever, but
for themselves.

109
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:11,309
That comes from the last one, is called as
the greed.

110
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:18,699
Now when you have greed, you don’t care
for anybody, you just want to have everything,

111
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,199
from another person.

112
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,929
You want to grab another person of everything.

113
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:32,579
Whatever another person has, you want to have
it.

114
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,369
But when you don’t want to have it everybody
wants to give you it, that’s My case.

115
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:43,299
I’m very afraid to say even that, “This
is nice,” because immediately tomorrow I’ll

116
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:53,389
find it in My house.

117
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:58,649
So this greed is the one which has done such
a harm to the whole world.

118
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,649
People have gone into great dominations on
other countries, for what?

119
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,380
For these diamonds and nonsensical things
like that?

120
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,859
They have ruined their own lives, the progenies
of the progenies they’ve ruined.

121
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:21,069
All their cunning they have used to ruin so
many nations just to put them one against

122
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:27,160
another, creating problems, doing all kinds
of intrique.

123
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,459
Just for what?

124
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:37,660
For greed which is absolutely like cancer,
doesn’t allow anybody else to exist.

125
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,439
And then you start eating yourself out.

126
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:46,529
It’s a disease, I think, greed.

127
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:55,089
And with that goes the miserliness; people
become miserly.

128
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:57,949
Then where does this greed end up.

129
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:05,169
After all the money that accumulates or things
that accumulate in your house, what happens

130
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,279
to them?

131
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,589
You want to use them.

132
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,009
What’s the matter with this one?

133
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:24,100
Try to be, not to be, I’ve told, otherwise
I’ll ask you to go out, all right?

134
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Concentrate.

135
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:32,579
So what happens to the people who are greedy?

136
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:39,730
They become miserly, they can’t enjoy life,
they cannot spend money because the greatest

137
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,319
joy is in giving things to others, no doubt
about it.

138
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:51,239
And they cannot give any joy to anyone, they
cannot create anything for the future progeny

139
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,919
to see.

140
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,419
So what happens to them?

141
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:59,689
Their children when they come in they become
wastrel, waste.

142
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:08,910
They waste all of them, they lead a wasteful
life, they get into wrong things, and ruin

143
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,910
themselves.

144
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,320
So their children who are born become miserly.

145
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,579
So the vicious circle starts moving.

146
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:29,260
He has said, “Kill all of them, these are
your six enemies.”

147
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:45,540
Now the contradiction, again people use, about
Shri Krishna, in so many other ways that it

148
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:55,900
is surprising that not only Christ, not only
Mohamad Sahib, not only Lao Tze, not only

149
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:05,410
Shri Rama but even Krishna was misused by
His followers.

150
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:15,230
He’s the one who is datast, the one…,
datast means who stands on the banks of the

151
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:21,960
attention and sees everything, who watches
everything, he’s the one who is the witness.

152
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:31,390
He described, “Sakshi rupena samsthita,”
he becomes a sakshi, a witness.

153
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:39,400
That’s what He has said, it’s a play,
it’s a play.

154
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,930
But in the name of Krishna you find all kinds
of absurd things people do.

155
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:52,080
They make dramas, they become Krishnas, they
become <inaudible >, they make people…,

156
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,560
befool them, make money out of it or they
sell books on the street.

157
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,810
Like if you go to Southall you’ll find so
many Westerners wearing funny dresses going

158
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:08,190
round asking for alms from Indians and Indians
say, “Oh look at that, these beggars, see

159
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:18,600
they have come to get some, let us give them
some money.”

160
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:32,470
So the contradiction of Krishna’s life is
such a miserable thing, is such a absurd thing

161
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:43,920
that it hurts Me to see how such a great incarnation
who was misused in this world by human beings.

162
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,760
If there was anything lacking in that incarnation,
was this, that He did not give realization

163
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,610
to people but He did talk about it.

164
00:19:53,610 --> 00:20:06,330
He said about it, talked of meditation; He
did all that was needed at this stage.

165
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,910
But what is the result?

166
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,610
All His incarnation was misused.

167
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:22,320
Throughout Gita if you read, you’d be amazed
how people have changed Gita and its writings

168
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
also.

169
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,400
Same in the Bible and same in the Koran.

170
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Things that they could never have said it,
how could they have said it, you’d be surprised,

171
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,200
impossible, because they cannot contradict
themselves.

172
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:51,910
For example, Gita is written by Vyasa who
was an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman.

173
00:20:51,910 --> 00:21:02,750
But in the Gita it is written that your caste
is determined by your birth; how can it be?

174
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:13,400
The one who is the son of…, an illegitimate
son of a fisherwoman, how can he tell like

175
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,090
that?

176
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,390
See the contradiction.

177
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,950
Same in the Bible, same in the Koran, same
in the Koran, in all these books, all these

178
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:29,600
people have tried to play a very nasty role
by changing it.

179
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,300
But you can find it out.

180
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:39,400
Luckily, whatever they may try, the truth
comes out in this manner and you can prove

181
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,100
it that whatever you’re saying is wrong,
cannot be.

182
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:51,360
The one Vyasa who wrote was the son of a fisherwoman
and how can he say that Brahmins are the highest,

183
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
when he’s not born as a Brahmin.

184
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,250
And to say that your caste Brahminism comes
from your birth…

185
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,870
From your rebirth!

186
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:17,130
Only they removed little bit – rebirth.

187
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:23,610
This is how they interpreted Gita in various
ways in such contradictory manners.

188
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:36,460
His whole writings or sayings could not be
changed, of course, they could not change

189
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,520
it but wherever they wanted to put their own
style, they did it.

190
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,610
Because ultimately, it went into the hands
of the Brahmins who were not really Brahmins,

191
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:52,010
they were the people who were sudras because
they were not even realized souls and behaving

192
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,030
in such a dirty manner; they should not be
called as Brahmins.

193
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,890
But it went into the hands of so-called Brahmins
and they misinterpreted it.

194
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,530
Same thing with Bible.

195
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:11,490
It went into the hands of horrid people.

196
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:18,850
Mr. John said something which was sensible,
all right, but what about the other fellow,

197
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,040
Paul?

198
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:28,030
He comes in and spoils everything.

199
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,230
Then comes Augustine, he spoils everything,
why?

200
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,580
Because they’re devils.

201
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:44,050
There is a evil force; this theory that there
is no evil force is a wrong theory, doesn’t

202
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,050
exist.

203
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:56,120
There is a evil force and don’t play into
the hands of evil force even this much.

204
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:05,919
And that was clearly taught by Shri Krishna.

205
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:13,440
But even then the contradictions can come
in.

206
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:28,690
Like if you are a Krishna bhakta then if you
just start running on the street, “Krishna!

207
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,690
Krishna!

208
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,690
Krishna!

209
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:42,250
Krishna!” like that, then you are celebrated,
or like a madcap go on, “Krishna!

210
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,780
Krishna!

211
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,380
Krishna!” like that.

212
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:58,710
Or else being worse than that is some people
said we’re Krishnas.

213
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,380
Like this horrible Rajneesh did.

214
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,090
He said He used to make the women naked, so,
“I’m making the women naked.”

215
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,970
I started wondering, “When did Krishna make
women naked?”

216
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:19,990
When He was a little boy less than five years
of age, He used to climb up on the trees and

217
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:26,990
the ladies used to take their bath in the
river Yamuna.

218
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:33,650
So He used to hide their clothes just to raise
their Kundalini and see how it works.

219
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,650
At the age of five years what does a child
understand?

220
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:45,460
This horrible fellow, was he five years of
age when he was doing this nonsense?

221
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,940
Using Shri Krishna’s name like this?

222
00:25:50,940 --> 00:26:00,270
And when he used to break the pitchers of
these gopis, what was He doing?

223
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:07,650
He was doing Kundalini awakening, because
the gopis were taking out the water from the

224
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:13,170
river Yamuna which was vibrated by Radha and
He used to break them on the back so that

225
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:21,290
the water would fall on their Kundalini and
they would get their realization, in this

226
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,440
lifetime.

227
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,050
That’s what’s His purification.

228
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:35,310
But first thing they will do is to separate
Shri Krishna as a child and Shri Krishna as

229
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:40,440
the one who talks to Arjuna, very nice.

230
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,380
So there is no relevance and use Him the way
you want.

231
00:26:45,380 --> 00:27:00,270
It’s a very common thing that people start
talking about Shri Krishna as if He’s in

232
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:05,380
their pocket, or they are the writers of Gita.

233
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,820
Like we have in the churches those bishops
and things who drink a lot and then they take

234
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:20,900
out their Bible and start reading upside down.

235
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,900
All these <inaudible > class whether this
belongs to this or to that, all of them are

236
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:34,490
hypocrites of the worst type, just money spinning
people.

237
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:40,150
Even Indian temples which are not far-fetched
are ruined.

238
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,170
All the ganja and all that are sold in Indian
temples.

239
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:57,520
All these popes and all these people are doing
something that is never expected.

240
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,230
Imagine they make a kind of a wine called
Benedictine in your Vatican.

241
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,450
Can you imagine a nonsensical thing like that?

242
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:20,520
Tomorrow they’ll open a beer bar, I won’t
be surprised.

243
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:28,210
So we come to a position to understand that
all those people who talk of these great incarnations

244
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,770
and profess a religion are all hypocrites.

245
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,180
There’s no religion.

246
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:47,350
Simple people who believe these hypocrites
because they’re so simple, so innocent.

247
00:28:47,350 --> 00:29:03,530
These cunning, greedy devils who started these
religions, exploited these simple people,

248
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:10,550
used them for making temples, churches, mosques,
they have no religion within them, how can

249
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,500
they talk of God?

250
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,030
Their life is so impure.

251
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:31,870
So we have to start our own innate religion,
our own spontaneous, natural religion which

252
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:38,160
is the human religion, which is the Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma.

253
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:52,150
The one that will give you the inner ascent,
not just talk, no hypocrisy; and all that

254
00:29:52,150 --> 00:30:05,650
which goes with religion to malign the names
of these great incarnations has to be brought

255
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:13,320
to the light for the people to see this nonsense
that has been eating into our societies, eating

256
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,820
into our families, eating into our children,
has to go away.

257
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:33,820
<Sanskrit expression>, whenever the religion
– normally doesn’t mean this nonsensical

258
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:57,320
religion – falls down, that time, <Sanskrit
expression>, to save the sadhus, the seekers.

259
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:05,730
<Sanskrit expression>, and to destroy all
these devils, “I take My birth again and

260
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,730
again.”

261
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,550
<Sanskrit expression>, “Every yuga I take
My birth.”

262
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:22,970
And this is what is an incarnation.

263
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:34,920
You must be very fortunate people that now
you can see the cunning of all these devils

264
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:47,820
and can exist into that purity, into that
benevolence, the hita, which was promised

265
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,420
by Shri Krishna.

266
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,450
He never told lies, what He told was the truth.

267
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,090
He was truth.

268
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:12,360
But those who tried to use Him had to take
course to something which was falsehood, hypocrisy

269
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:23,490
and cunning but that in no way could stop
the truthful people from getting to reality.

270
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,190
May God bless you all.
