00:08.360 --> 00:13.074
But you cannot become yourself unless and until this Sahastrara,

00:13.275 --> 00:22.153
this brain is opened out and the Kundalini becomes one with the Paramchaitanya.

00:24.185 --> 00:33.322
Before that, you are in complete ignorance about what is good and what is bad.

00:33.523 --> 00:39.590
Whatever you think [that], for this brain, is good, you do it.

00:39.791 --> 00:44.448
But whatever is really good, you do not know,

00:44.649 --> 00:48.831
because you do not know the Reality.

00:49.863 --> 00:54.546
Now we have to understand the consciousness that we have:

00:54.747 --> 01:01.340
consciousness of being alive, consciousness of so many things we have,

01:01.541 --> 01:06.994
and the so-called knowledge we have about everything.

01:07.573 --> 01:14.415
All that consciousness is stored near the liver – for your information –

01:14.661 --> 01:17.592
by this diaphragm.

01:17.793 --> 01:23.319
But then, this consciousness starts rising, higher and higher.

01:23.520 --> 01:28.052
Then you become aware. In the evolutionary process,

01:28.253 --> 01:33.306
you become aware, aware of things.

01:33.507 --> 01:40.845
Without going through your brain, you just become aware. And how?

01:41.046 --> 01:46.840
Not by thinking, not by understanding or seeing,

01:47.041 --> 01:53.138
but you become aware because your brain has now

01:53.339 --> 02:00.572
started working in a manner that’s very, very sensitive.

02:00.773 --> 02:06.583
So you just become aware of some sort of a fear,

02:06.784 --> 02:13.428
or maybe some sort of a goodness or anything. But it goes even further.

02:13.629 --> 02:18.810
The growth of consciousness, which becomes aware, goes further:

02:19.011 --> 02:29.023
where you start liking a person, or disliking a person.

02:30.794 --> 02:36.062
But, still it’s nothing definite and sure.

02:36.263 --> 02:40.698
You dislike a person because he has a particular type of a face,

02:40.899 --> 02:44.657
maybe eyes or maybe anything.

02:45.630 --> 02:52.686
Or maybe because you have known somebody who has been very nice,

02:52.887 --> 02:59.014
so you start transferring that image onto others.

02:59.215 --> 03:07.261
With these transferred images, you can hate or love someone.

03:07.462 --> 03:13.164
Then you start saying, “I hate this, I hate that,”

03:13.716 --> 03:18.414
which has no, actually, substantial meaning.

03:18.615 --> 03:27.142
You hate it because, perhaps, maybe such and such person looks like somebody.

03:27.499 --> 03:31.561
Now you go further with it, then you see that, such and such person –

03:31.762 --> 03:35.409
now I’m not talking about things, but about persons -

03:35.610 --> 03:43.222
such and such person has done this harm to me - something positive.

03:43.423 --> 03:49.571
So you start feeling that you should hate that person.

03:50.276 --> 03:53.922
Now you start hating that person. With that hatred

03:54.123 --> 03:58.537
you develop new faculties [of] how to harm that person.

03:58.738 --> 04:02.984
Then you start thinking how to destroy that person,

04:03.185 --> 04:08.564
how to make his life miserable.

04:08.765 --> 04:14.495
Then you may beat that person, you may shout at that person,

04:14.696 --> 04:18.773
you may try to kill that person. You can do anything.

04:18.974 --> 04:24.347
So now the awareness is going towards another direction, which is darkness,

04:24.548 --> 04:30.183
which is not light, because in the light you won’t do such a thing.

04:30.384 --> 04:36.261
In the light you see everybody, everybody is sitting, you know how far you are,

04:36.462 --> 04:41.503
where you are sitting. If you want to go out, you know how to walk out.

04:41.704 --> 04:46.514
But when, in the darkness you are there, you just don’t understand

04:46.715 --> 04:54.454
and you go on behaving in a manner which is, which cannot be explained

04:54.655 --> 04:58.857
otherwise, except that, because you are a human being.

04:59.058 --> 05:04.105
Animals don’t do like that. Animals have limitation [on them].

05:04.306 --> 05:11.096
The animals, if they find something wrong, something absolutely

05:11.303 --> 05:16.238
harmful done to them, then they will attack or run away,

05:16.439 --> 05:21.460
but they do not carry a kind of a hatred or anything.

05:21.661 --> 05:26.183
But they can carry the impression of fear, could be,

05:26.384 --> 05:32.455
of some sort of a harm done to them. But human beings are not like that.

05:32.656 --> 05:42.004
Human beings don’t have any particular reason, as such, to hate someone.

05:42.205 --> 05:48.940
But why it works out? Because they are involved in their ego.

05:49.141 --> 05:58.484
Egoistical person feels that he has a right to do what he wants to do:

05:58.717 --> 06:05.522
he can kill anybody, he can bomb anyone, he can do whatever he likes.

06:06.411 --> 06:11.923
But a person who is not doing that, is the other way round:

06:12.124 --> 06:16.965
he is frightened, he is afraid of someone.

06:17.166 --> 06:21.960
Now the awareness moves on. This is a subtler awareness,

06:22.161 --> 06:29.006
because, if you are afraid of somebody, you would not like to go to his house,

06:29.207 --> 06:34.685
you will avoid him in the street, all things you can do.

06:34.886 --> 06:39.387
So all this kind of knowledge about other human beings also

06:39.588 --> 06:43.064
accumulates in your mind.

06:43.265 --> 06:52.415
Then this thing starts working on a collective level,

06:52.616 --> 06:57.077
because you think, “This group is very bad. They are good.

06:57.278 --> 07:02.101
These are bad. They are excellent!” like that, it works out.

07:02.302 --> 07:09.037
In your own mind you think that somebody has a group,

07:09.238 --> 07:13.594
and the other group is better or that group is better.

07:13.801 --> 07:23.661
And collectively, then, you start working out your whole temperament, your awareness.

07:23.856 --> 07:27.899
Like once people decide that say, for example,

07:28.100 --> 07:35.918
that black people are to be finished, so all the white people can join together.

07:36.119 --> 07:44.103
Or like at the time of Hitler, he decided that all other human beings but Germans

07:44.304 --> 07:49.505
were useless. So he gathered people around his thought and ideas.

07:49.706 --> 07:54.626
And this collective awareness just comes to,

07:54.827 --> 07:58.845
I don’t know how, but it enters into the minds of many.

07:59.046 --> 08:04.495
They never challenge it, they never ask [about] it, whether it is correct or not.

08:04.696 --> 08:11.321
So this grows more and more and more, and then it becomes like a –

08:11.918 --> 08:17.994
country-wise, you can say – an awareness of this kind of a feeling.

08:18.195 --> 08:27.737
But whether it is correct or not is not understood, is not known.

08:27.938 --> 08:33.381
So, what is important [is] that you should know Reality,

08:33.582 --> 08:38.202
you should know exactly what is right and what is wrong.

08:38.403 --> 08:48.339
For that, as I told you, there is this great power of Kundalini within you.

08:48.894 --> 08:52.028
She is the one, She passes through all these centres,

08:52.229 --> 08:58.474
enlightens them first of all, so your awareness gets enlightened.

08:58.675 --> 09:04.119
And when She pierces through Sahastrara, She joins you

09:04.320 --> 09:12.595
to this All-pervading Power which is Knowledge,

09:13.888 --> 09:20.720
which is love, which is Truth.

09:22.166 --> 09:26.528
So, after that, you immediately know –

09:27.185 --> 09:31.350
some people don’t know immediately, but some people do –

09:31.551 --> 09:40.350
that what we have been thinking so far, of separating ourselves from others

09:40.551 --> 09:44.503
by thinking they are not all right, they are wrong, they are whatever it is –

09:44.704 --> 09:48.781
this disappears. This disappears completely,

09:48.982 --> 09:52.734
and then you realise that your awareness itself,

09:52.940 --> 09:58.371
awareness itself is dominated by so many other circumstances.

09:58.572 --> 10:02.578
For example, where you were born, what your parents taught you,

10:02.779 --> 10:05.675
what experiences you have had.

10:05.876 --> 10:10.904
And then you realise that it was all wrong, because it’s not Reality.

10:11.105 --> 10:16.400
Whatever feelings you have, whatever ideas you have

10:16.601 --> 10:23.860
about another person or about other nation, all of them are not correct.

10:24.061 --> 10:31.918
Because now your Sahastrara is awakened, that it is connected now

10:32.119 --> 10:38.604
to the All-pervading Power. So this starts flowing into you.

10:38.805 --> 10:47.855
This - I should say - enlightened awareness, it starts flowing down into your being,

10:48.056 --> 10:56.095
in your brain, and then on your nerves you can feel that awareness.

10:56.296 --> 11:02.473
Now once you want to know about something, whether it is right or wrong –

11:02.674 --> 11:06.291
absolute right and wrong, it’s not [a] question of relative –

11:06.492 --> 11:11.345
you just have to put your hands towards that person,

11:11.546 --> 11:14.535
or towards that thing or whatever it is:

11:14.736 --> 11:19.315
immediately on these vibrations you will know.
