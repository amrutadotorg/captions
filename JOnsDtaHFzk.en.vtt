02:27.009 --> 02:34.470
Today is a great day of Mahalakshmi Puja.

02:34.676 --> 02:38.830
Mahalakshmi is an incarnation

02:38.902 --> 02:44.701
of the Lakshmi, the power of Vishnu.

02:44.836 --> 02:49.273
She only incar­nated.

03:30.895 --> 03:33.314
This Mahalakshmi principle

03:33.345 --> 03:36.065
is born out of the Lakshmi,

03:36.168 --> 03:41.494
who is the power of Sri Vishnu.

03:53.393 --> 03:57.201
When in a human being

03:57.272 --> 04:05.236
the desire to rise higher comes in,

04:05.331 --> 04:12.428
the Lakshmi principle becomes the Mahalakshmi principle.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.095
Like in the West we can say,

04:19.103 --> 04:21.785
people have affluence of Lakshmi,

04:21.888 --> 04:26.607
so they wanted to rise above that principle

04:26.673 --> 04:32.377
and become Mahalakshmi.

04:39.351 --> 04:44.457
In the awareness it acts on the matter like aesthetics;

04:44.521 --> 04:47.610
people worry more about aesthetics

04:47.658 --> 04:53.211
than about possessions.

04:56.709 --> 05:00.005
And when they start growing

05:00.068 --> 05:03.937
higher and higher in their awareness of seeking,

05:04.020 --> 05:07.089
then they find that

05:07.121 --> 05:14.191
the attention should be such,

05:14.278 --> 05:18.140
that they should pay more im­portance

05:18.204 --> 05:20.696
to the aesthetics of things

05:20.760 --> 05:25.646
than to the gross values.

05:37.869 --> 05:41.134
Now when this desire becomes

05:41.249 --> 05:44.166
evident in human beings,

05:44.210 --> 05:51.009
then only Lakshmi incarnates as Mahalakshmi.

05:56.652 --> 06:00.727
So She incarnated as Mahalakshmi

06:00.874 --> 06:05.913
when Rama came on this earth, first time.

06:12.803 --> 06:17.015
And also She incarnated as Radha

06:17.076 --> 06:21.418
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

06:24.338 --> 06:26.743
And when She came as Mary,

06:26.806 --> 06:29.218
it was Mahalakshmi

06:29.285 --> 06:35.076
who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ.

06:40.676 --> 06:45.572
So the child She bore

06:45.668 --> 06:52.362
was the great personality, of Mahavishnu.

06:59.562 --> 07:06.292
This Mahavishnu-tattwa is also represented,

07:06.331 --> 07:08.697
or we can say has an aspect,

07:08.737 --> 07:13.553
of others, which in­carnated on this earth

07:13.600 --> 07:18.807
as two children of Sita.

07:24.541 --> 07:31.176
They incarnated as

07:31.342 --> 07:38.084
Mahavira and Buddha, as Hassan and Hussein.

07:40.996 --> 07:46.660
Also at the time of the prophets

07:46.827 --> 07:50.705
Mahalakshmi incarnates as

07:50.759 --> 07:55.195
a pure relationship with them.

08:00.691 --> 08:03.889
Like Raja Janaka’s daughter was Janaki,

08:03.992 --> 08:07.989
means Sita;

08:08.092 --> 08:13.479
then She came on this earth

08:13.598 --> 08:16.507
as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib;

08:16.610 --> 08:20.039
and then She came on this earth as Nanaki,

08:20.055 --> 08:24.766
the sister of Nanaka.

08:37.315 --> 08:42.731
So She resides as a pure relationship

08:42.834 --> 08:47.149
of these gurus.

08:51.711 --> 08:57.286
Thus the Mahalakshmi’s greatness is that,

08:57.329 --> 09:00.367
through Her power only the Sushumna

09:00.407 --> 09:04.878
is cover­ed by Kundalini.

09:09.832 --> 09:15.007
She is the power of our evol­ution.

09:15.114 --> 09:17.675
And by Her power only

09:17.707 --> 09:20.367
we have risen to be human beings

09:20.393 --> 09:23.052
and by Her son’s power

09:23.101 --> 09:27.811
we are going to become higher people.

09:35.860 --> 09:39.114
Thus the impor­tance of Mahalakshmi is very great

09:39.154 --> 09:44.396
for all the Sahaja Yogis.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.288
Because She guides our Vishnu tattwa

09:48.320 --> 09:52.859
to its culmination, to its completion,

09:56.464 --> 10:02.821
which is the principle of our evolution.

10:02.944 --> 10:05.823
Thus She is a giver of Dharma,

10:05.900 --> 10:08.900
She gives us the Dharma and

10:08.926 --> 10:14.688
She is the giver of the truth.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.698
She is the one who relates us to our brain,

10:19.729 --> 10:25.637
the whole brain’s system is Mahalakshmi’s system.

10:28.315 --> 10:31.243
So it is She who exposes

10:31.267 --> 10:36.408
the whole of the knowledge as truth to us,

10:36.511 --> 10:41.179
on our central nervous system.

10:43.527 --> 10:46.923
But at the state of Virata,

10:46.971 --> 10:50.202
when Vishnu becomes the Virata,

10:50.242 --> 10:55.325
the great primordial being,

10:55.381 --> 11:02.053
then She is called as Viratangana, as his power.

11:10.239 --> 11:14.630
So these are the incarnations of Mahala­kshmi

11:14.676 --> 11:19.136
about which I have told.

11:25.721 --> 11:29.857
There’s so much can be said about this Mahalakshmi­tattwa;

11:30.016 --> 11:32.528
you are all blessed so much by that.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.282
And so today we remember

11:35.368 --> 11:39.817
Her great in­carnation as Maria,

11:39.904 --> 11:43.102
who was very great because

11:43.166 --> 11:47.070
She had to bear terrible pain in Her heart

11:47.118 --> 11:50.056
with all Her powers that She had,

11:50.127 --> 11:53.166
She was a tremendously powerful Lady.

11:53.205 --> 11:57.655
But despite that, She bore all the tortures

11:57.782 --> 12:03.186
of Christ upon Her heart.

12:03.226 --> 12:08.398
And it was Her order and Her desire

12:08.454 --> 12:12.434
that Christ had to crucify Himself

12:12.545 --> 12:17.765
so that people could be resurrected.

12:45.319 --> 12:48.190
And sometimes Indians ask Me

12:48.229 --> 12:51.418
what did She do to be a Mahalakshmi, what did She achieve?

12:51.450 --> 12:54.561
I said: “With all Her powers to bear it.

12:54.592 --> 13:00.767
To play the drama it must be too much.”

13:12.184 --> 13:19.312
So She is the redeemer and She connects you to God.

13:21.901 --> 13:25.863
In the sense She is the bridge.

13:25.935 --> 13:31.819
And the Kundalini rises over the bridge.

13:31.946 --> 13:37.490
And Kundalini is the Mahakali.

13:37.562 --> 13:39.839
Now we have a temple in India

13:39.911 --> 13:42.885
which you have visited of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur;

13:42.933 --> 13:46.663
and there, when they sing,

13:46.735 --> 13:49.291
when they worship Mahalakshmi

13:49.331 --> 13:51.479
at that time they say “udho, udho,Ambe”.

13:51.519 --> 13:57.351
That time they say: “O Ambe, the Kundalini, you rise”.

14:06.854 --> 14:10.504
But Kundalini is the potential of all the three powers:

14:10.544 --> 14:13.979
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,

14:14.058 --> 14:20.596
because it is the primordial desire.

14:22.734 --> 14:25.735
Because She is the Holy Ghost, you see,

14:25.791 --> 14:29.686
so She contains all these three powers in it.

14:34.328 --> 14:37.068
Like Adi Shakti has all the three powers

14:37.100 --> 14:41.200
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

14:44.102 --> 14:46.976
So now today is a great day for us

14:47.047 --> 14:49.812
because Mahalakshmi has helped us so much,

14:49.859 --> 14:52.064
Her blessings are much.

14:52.105 --> 14:54.710
She looks after all our well-­being,

14:54.790 --> 14:57.155
She is the one who looks after

14:57.187 --> 15:00.122
all our problems of redemption,

15:00.218 --> 15:03.410
She is the one who gives us all the possible

15:03.458 --> 15:06.268
help in our Chakras and correction of them.

15:06.292 --> 15:09.078
And She is the one who gives us

15:09.118 --> 15:13.458
all that is material or physical well­ being

15:13.537 --> 15:18.151
so we have to be very very thankful to Her today.

15:18.191 --> 15:20.889
You have to be grateful.

15:20.985 --> 15:23.410
And also today is Gregoire’s birthday.

15:23.434 --> 15:25.830
So I would like to congratulate him

15:25.894 --> 15:28.172
for making Me come to Munich

15:28.212 --> 15:30.623
because we had such a tremendous programme

15:30.679 --> 15:36.112
May God bless you all.
