00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:34.470
Today is a great day of Mahalakshmi Puja.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:38.830
Mahalakshmi is an incarnation

00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:44.701
of the Lakshmi, the power of Vishnu.

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:49.273
She only incar­nated.

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:33.314
This Mahalakshmi principle

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:36.065
is born out of the Lakshmi,

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:41.494
who is the power of Sri Vishnu.

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:57.201
When in a human being

00:03:57.272 --> 00:04:05.236
the desire to rise higher comes in,

00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:12.428
the Lakshmi principle becomes the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.095
Like in the West we can say,

00:04:19.103 --> 00:04:21.785
people have affluence of Lakshmi,

00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:26.607
so they wanted to rise above that principle

00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:32.377
and become Mahalakshmi.

00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:44.457
In the awareness it acts on the matter like aesthetics;

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:47.610
people worry more about aesthetics

00:04:47.658 --> 00:04:53.211
than about possessions.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:00.005
And when they start growing

00:05:00.068 --> 00:05:03.937
higher and higher in their awareness of seeking,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.089
then they find that

00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:14.191
the attention should be such,

00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:18.140
that they should pay more im­portance

00:05:18.204 --> 00:05:20.696
to the aesthetics of things

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.646
than to the gross values.

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:41.134
Now when this desire becomes

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.166
evident in human beings,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.009
then only Lakshmi incarnates as Mahalakshmi.

00:05:56.652 --> 00:06:00.727
So She incarnated as Mahalakshmi

00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:05.913
when Rama came on this earth, first time.

00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:17.015
And also She incarnated as Radha

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:21.418
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

00:06:24.338 --> 00:06:26.743
And when She came as Mary,

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:29.218
it was Mahalakshmi

00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:35.076
who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:45.572
So the child She bore

00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:52.362
was the great personality, of Mahavishnu.

00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:06.292
This Mahavishnu-tattwa is also represented,

00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:08.697
or we can say has an aspect,

00:07:08.737 --> 00:07:13.553
of others, which in­carnated on this earth

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.807
as two children of Sita.

00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:31.176
They incarnated as

00:07:31.342 --> 00:07:38.084
Mahavira and Buddha, as Hassan and Hussein.

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:46.660
Also at the time of the prophets

00:07:46.827 --> 00:07:50.705
Mahalakshmi incarnates as

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:55.195
a pure relationship with them.

00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:03.889
Like Raja Janaka’s daughter was Janaki,

00:08:03.992 --> 00:08:07.989
means Sita;

00:08:08.092 --> 00:08:13.479
then She came on this earth

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:16.507
as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib;

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.039
and then She came on this earth as Nanaki,

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:24.766
the sister of Nanaka.

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:42.731
So She resides as a pure relationship

00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:47.149
of these gurus.

00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:57.286
Thus the Mahalakshmi’s greatness is that,

00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:00.367
through Her power only the Sushumna

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:04.878
is cover­ed by Kundalini.

00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:15.007
She is the power of our evol­ution.

00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:17.675
And by Her power only

00:09:17.707 --> 00:09:20.367
we have risen to be human beings

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.052
and by Her son’s power

00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:27.811
we are going to become higher people.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.114
Thus the impor­tance of Mahalakshmi is very great

00:09:39.154 --> 00:09:44.396
for all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:48.288
Because She guides our Vishnu tattwa

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.859
to its culmination, to its completion,

00:09:56.464 --> 00:10:02.821
which is the principle of our evolution.

00:10:02.944 --> 00:10:05.823
Thus She is a giver of Dharma,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.900
She gives us the Dharma and

00:10:08.926 --> 00:10:14.688
She is the giver of the truth.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.698
She is the one who relates us to our brain,

00:10:19.729 --> 00:10:25.637
the whole brain’s system is Mahalakshmi’s system.

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:31.243
So it is She who exposes

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:36.408
the whole of the knowledge as truth to us,

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:41.179
on our central nervous system.

00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:46.923
But at the state of Virata,

00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:50.202
when Vishnu becomes the Virata,

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:55.325
the great primordial being,

00:10:55.381 --> 00:11:02.053
then She is called as Viratangana, as his power.

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:14.630
So these are the incarnations of Mahala­kshmi

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:19.136
about which I have told.

00:11:25.721 --> 00:11:29.857
There’s so much can be said about this Mahalakshmi­tattwa;

00:11:30.016 --> 00:11:32.528
you are all blessed so much by that.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.282
And so today we remember

00:11:35.368 --> 00:11:39.817
Her great in­carnation as Maria,

00:11:39.904 --> 00:11:43.102
who was very great because

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:47.070
She had to bear terrible pain in Her heart

00:11:47.118 --> 00:11:50.056
with all Her powers that She had,

00:11:50.127 --> 00:11:53.166
She was a tremendously powerful Lady.

00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:57.655
But despite that, She bore all the tortures

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:03.186
of Christ upon Her heart.

00:12:03.226 --> 00:12:08.398
And it was Her order and Her desire

00:12:08.454 --> 00:12:12.434
that Christ had to crucify Himself

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:17.765
so that people could be resurrected.

00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:48.190
And sometimes Indians ask Me

00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:51.418
what did She do to be a Mahalakshmi, what did She achieve?

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.561
I said: “With all Her powers to bear it.

00:12:54.592 --> 00:13:00.767
To play the drama it must be too much.”

00:13:12.184 --> 00:13:19.312
So She is the redeemer and She connects you to God.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.863
In the sense She is the bridge.

00:13:25.935 --> 00:13:31.819
And the Kundalini rises over the bridge.

00:13:31.946 --> 00:13:37.490
And Kundalini is the Mahakali.

00:13:37.562 --> 00:13:39.839
Now we have a temple in India

00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:42.885
which you have visited of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur;

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:46.663
and there, when they sing,

00:13:46.735 --> 00:13:49.291
when they worship Mahalakshmi

00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:51.479
at that time they say “udho, udho,Ambe”.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:57.351
That time they say: “O Ambe, the Kundalini, you rise”.

00:14:06.854 --> 00:14:10.504
But Kundalini is the potential of all the three powers:

00:14:10.544 --> 00:14:13.979
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,

00:14:14.058 --> 00:14:20.596
because it is the primordial desire.

00:14:22.734 --> 00:14:25.735
Because She is the Holy Ghost, you see,

00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:29.686
so She contains all these three powers in it.

00:14:34.328 --> 00:14:37.068
Like Adi Shakti has all the three powers

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.200
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:46.976
So now today is a great day for us

00:14:47.047 --> 00:14:49.812
because Mahalakshmi has helped us so much,

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:52.064
Her blessings are much.

00:14:52.105 --> 00:14:54.710
She looks after all our well-­being,

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.155
She is the one who looks after

00:14:57.187 --> 00:15:00.122
all our problems of redemption,

00:15:00.218 --> 00:15:03.410
She is the one who gives us all the possible

00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:06.268
help in our Chakras and correction of them.

00:15:06.292 --> 00:15:09.078
And She is the one who gives us

00:15:09.118 --> 00:15:13.458
all that is material or physical well­ being

00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:18.151
so we have to be very very thankful to Her today.

00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:20.889
You have to be grateful.

00:15:20.985 --> 00:15:23.410
And also today is Gregoire’s birthday.

00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:25.830
So I would like to congratulate him

00:15:25.894 --> 00:15:28.172
for making Me come to Munich

00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:30.623
because we had such a tremendous programme

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:36.112
May God bless you all.
