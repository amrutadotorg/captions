00:02.642 --> 00:07.238
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

00:18.139 --> 00:21.790
Today we have gathered to do the puja of Fatima Bi,

00:23.030 --> 00:26.315
who was the symbol of Gruha Laxmi,

00:27.367 --> 00:30.057
and so we are going to have the puja

00:30.705 --> 00:33.688
of the Gruha Laxmi principle within us.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.027
As the housewife has to finish every work,

00:40.692 --> 00:44.032
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

00:44.668 --> 00:48.632
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

00:49.018 --> 00:51.930
and then I could come for your puja,

00:52.288 --> 00:55.077
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

00:55.532 --> 00:58.976
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

01:02.491 --> 01:07.271
Now, the principle of Gruha Laxmi

01:08.783 --> 01:13.342
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

01:13.454 --> 01:17.059
it’s not a human being’s creation

01:20.216 --> 01:23.678
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

01:26.746 --> 01:32.916
The Gruha Laxmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

01:33.168 --> 01:37.517
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

01:39.284 --> 01:44.379
Now She is always born in a relationship

01:46.124 --> 01:54.045
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

01:54.814 --> 01:58.015
So She comes as sister or

01:58.273 --> 02:01.431
She comes as a daughter.

02:04.898 --> 02:07.540
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

02:09.133 --> 02:12.426
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

02:14.147 --> 02:19.099
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

02:21.273 --> 02:23.439
the religion into their hands

02:23.717 --> 02:27.269
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

02:28.793 --> 02:31.480
The attention was not paid so much

02:32.060 --> 02:34.784
towards the ascent of the person.

02:36.054 --> 02:40.130
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

02:40.836 --> 02:42.773
And He is the only one -

02:42.916 --> 02:47.059
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

02:48.772 --> 02:51.327
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

02:51.391 --> 02:53.644
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

02:54.033 --> 02:58.943
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
[brother of Jnaneshwara],

02:59.290 --> 03:02.435
which, you can go to Pune,

03:02.515 --> 03:04.498
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

03:38.577 --> 03:42.965
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

03:43.963 --> 03:48.996
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

03:52.552 --> 03:56.950
She stayed in her house, in her household

03:57.546 --> 04:01.511
and She observed what you call

04:01.951 --> 04:05.894
a kind of a panda
[? Pata: veil]

04:06.021 --> 04:10.882
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

04:12.504 --> 04:14.886
It is a symbol that a woman

04:15.435 --> 04:20.747
who is a housewife has to

04:24.792 --> 04:31.647
save her chastity by covering her face because

04:32.079 --> 04:35.332
She was a beautiful woman and

04:36.788 --> 04:43.016
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

04:44.065 --> 04:46.958
and She would have been definitely attacked

04:47.458 --> 04:51.493
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

04:51.986 --> 04:54.609
As you know, in the time of Christ,

04:55.355 --> 04:59.207
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

04:59.557 --> 05:02.799
had to be very, very potential personality

05:03.474 --> 05:07.351
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

05:10.368 --> 05:13.716
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

05:15.136 --> 05:20.532
so She allowed her sons

05:20.814 --> 05:23.671
or actually ordered them

05:24.801 --> 05:27.184
to fight those fanatics

05:27.857 --> 05:33.119
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

05:34.671 --> 05:38.195
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

05:38.983 --> 05:41.897
It’s a very beautiful thing how

05:42.864 --> 05:45.403
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

05:46.087 --> 05:49.517
took a form of Vishnumaya

05:52.610 --> 05:58.929
just to establish the beautiful principle of

06:03.144 --> 06:05.628
a housewife.

06:07.712 --> 06:10.608
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

06:11.463 --> 06:14.415
and She knew that her children will be killed.

06:16.913 --> 06:19.827
But these people are never killed,

06:20.185 --> 06:23.242
they never die nor do they suffer.

06:23.410 --> 06:26.904
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

06:28.130 --> 06:31.026
As a result of that,

06:33.604 --> 06:38.518
another system started where they respected saints;

06:38.840 --> 06:44.699
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

06:45.211 --> 06:47.435
or we can call them the people

06:47.673 --> 06:50.580
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

06:51.160 --> 06:55.004
Then we have got “Chisti”.

06:55.293 --> 07:01.258
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

07:01.681 --> 07:05.214
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

07:05.805 --> 07:09.949
But still they could not transcend

07:10.372 --> 07:16.671
the limits of religiosity.

07:18.079 --> 07:21.438
So they also became extremely fanatic.

07:22.192 --> 07:27.260
Firstly they would not see to

07:27.924 --> 07:31.479
another religion where they had saints.

07:31.814 --> 07:35.890
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

07:37.005 --> 07:42.840
and even when we had a great saint

07:43.504 --> 07:48.600
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

07:50.382 --> 07:55.539
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

07:55.762 --> 07:59.938
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

08:01.371 --> 08:05.880
We did not deny,

08:06.175 --> 08:08.655
as far as Hindus were concerned,

08:09.356 --> 08:14.485
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

08:15.410 --> 08:18.950
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

08:19.319 --> 08:22.143
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

08:22.863 --> 08:28.063
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

08:28.438 --> 08:31.996
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

08:32.126 --> 08:34.681
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

08:36.203 --> 08:38.432
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

08:39.356 --> 08:45.673
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

08:46.522 --> 08:50.690
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

08:51.178 --> 08:53.012
So they could not get out of it.

08:53.274 --> 08:56.452
So we have another one called Haji Malang

08:56.587 --> 09:00.200
who was worshipped by Hindus.

09:00.845 --> 09:03.839
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

09:06.636 --> 09:08.957
This Haji Malang

09:09.601 --> 09:14.221
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

09:14.664 --> 09:18.639
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

09:19.188 --> 09:21.198
just to counter balance.

09:21.532 --> 09:23.454
They did all kinds of things.

09:24.006 --> 09:26.497
There are many saints like that.

09:27.778 --> 09:33.606
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

09:34.218 --> 09:39.835
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

09:40.881 --> 09:43.446
of that place, which was very bad. Even

09:43.692 --> 09:47.599
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

09:48.290 --> 09:50.253
They all make an earnings,

09:50.404 --> 09:53.850
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

09:55.380 --> 10:00.995
So this saint died and was buried there.

10:01.365 --> 10:03.650
There were many people who were depending on it.

10:03.798 --> 10:07.301
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

10:08.261 --> 10:10.471
'What is your religion?'

10:11.230 --> 10:12.873
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

10:13.365 --> 10:16.478
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

10:16.854 --> 10:19.362
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

10:20.922 --> 10:24.591
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

10:24.782 --> 10:26.694
They have no religions.

10:28.730 --> 10:32.769
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

10:33.226 --> 10:36.633
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

10:37.290 --> 10:40.163
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

10:40.219 --> 10:43.951
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

10:44.158 --> 10:46.670
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

10:46.948 --> 10:49.435
that they made a fanatic group.

10:50.216 --> 10:54.620
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

10:55.508 --> 10:58.866
against your innate religion within your-self

10:59.224 --> 11:01.723
because it creates poison.

11:03.451 --> 11:05.602
It's a venomous thing.

11:06.494 --> 11:09.025
It makes you hate others.

11:09.808 --> 11:12.094
When you start hating others,

11:12.589 --> 11:16.144
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

11:16.625 --> 11:20.880
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

11:24.823 --> 11:26.936
Hating any one

11:27.526 --> 11:31.129
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

11:31.281 --> 11:34.631
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.454
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

11:37.735 --> 11:40.115
They bite some one because that is their nature.

11:40.356 --> 11:42.889
They cut some one because that's their nature.

11:43.168 --> 11:45.113
They never hate someone.

11:45.409 --> 11:49.061
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

11:49.231 --> 11:54.431
is a speciality of human conception

11:54.639 --> 11:58.141
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

12:00.742 --> 12:03.490
And this horrible thing hatred

12:04.721 --> 12:08.667
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

12:09.220 --> 12:13.586
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

12:14.479 --> 12:18.909
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

12:19.033 --> 12:21.380
in every religion.

12:22.814 --> 12:25.767
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

12:25.943 --> 12:31.746
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

12:32.542 --> 12:37.829
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

12:38.541 --> 12:43.669
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

12:43.910 --> 12:48.348
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

12:51.029 --> 12:55.731
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

12:56.890 --> 12:59.564
to overcome that hatred,

13:00.033 --> 13:04.982
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

13:05.529 --> 13:08.939
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

13:09.157 --> 13:13.323
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

13:14.201 --> 13:19.552
How? In the family when you have a household,

13:23.085 --> 13:28.864
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

13:29.289 --> 13:35.816
between the children, between the husband and the children.

13:36.416 --> 13:41.060
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

13:41.746 --> 13:44.645
then how can she subdue it?

13:44.844 --> 13:49.863
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

13:50.135 --> 13:53.065
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

13:53.242 --> 13:56.099
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

13:56.719 --> 14:01.765
But the housewife's job is to smooth

14:02.959 --> 14:10.147
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

14:13.830 --> 14:16.734
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

14:16.991 --> 14:20.625
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

14:20.915 --> 14:24.089
'wherever the housewife is respected,

14:24.911 --> 14:27.665
there only the Gods reside'.

14:30.526 --> 14:34.711
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

14:35.867 --> 14:38.137
because we are no good for economics,

14:38.162 --> 14:41.163
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

14:41.325 --> 14:42.968
Men folk are useless,

14:43.153 --> 14:45.914
they don't know any household work or anything,

14:46.042 --> 14:49.470
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

14:49.613 --> 14:52.143
is maintained by the women of the household.

14:54.520 --> 14:59.316
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

15:00.907 --> 15:04.855
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

15:05.022 --> 15:08.350
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

15:09.887 --> 15:14.271
It's like the preservation of that

15:17.275 --> 15:21.093
principle of a housewife.

15:23.284 --> 15:26.259
But some men, I mean many of them,

15:26.666 --> 15:30.930
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

15:32.522 --> 15:35.331
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

15:37.075 --> 15:39.939
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

15:41.985 --> 15:44.200
But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

15:44.381 --> 15:46.139
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

15:46.242 --> 15:50.276
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

15:51.072 --> 15:55.377
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

15:55.656 --> 15:58.508
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

16:00.575 --> 16:03.767
[you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

16:04.365 --> 16:08.056
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

16:08.303 --> 16:10.448
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

16:10.754 --> 16:12.873
they have no love or respect for each other

16:13.183 --> 16:15.947
but they have an awe or fear.

16:17.704 --> 16:19.801
And they are afraid of such a woman.

16:20.248 --> 16:24.954
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
the husbands are better controlled.

16:26.957 --> 16:30.374
But their basic principle they lose.

16:31.187 --> 16:33.861
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

16:36.373 --> 16:38.756
and they land up in difficulties.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.627
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

16:43.754 --> 16:46.200
is to respect her chastity,

16:48.563 --> 16:52.604
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.348
That is the steadiness of her.

16:56.528 --> 16:59.483
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

17:00.280 --> 17:04.934
If the wife is docile or obedient,

17:05.142 --> 17:10.911
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
Alright!

17:12.860 --> 17:16.860
But this woman, the housewife,

17:17.642 --> 17:21.659
has to know that she is not docile.

17:22.607 --> 17:27.268
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

17:28.279 --> 17:33.299
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

17:34.588 --> 17:37.614
If the husband is stupid, alright,

17:37.831 --> 17:40.275
he's stupid like a child, finished!

17:40.926 --> 17:43.938
But the husband has to know that he must

17:44.222 --> 17:47.194
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

17:48.271 --> 17:50.275
he's good for nothing.

17:52.586 --> 17:55.053
First thing is that he must see

17:55.284 --> 17:59.961
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.704
Then the blessings flow.

18:02.923 --> 18:08.502
But in no way he should insult her

18:08.958 --> 18:11.932
or be unkind to her

18:12.159 --> 18:15.410
and raise his voice or say things to her.

18:15.537 --> 18:21.000
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

18:22.028 --> 18:24.512
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

18:24.635 --> 18:28.131
give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

18:28.748 --> 18:31.632
She has not to be dominating,

18:31.849 --> 18:35.896
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.021
She is the source of peace,

18:40.873 --> 18:43.320
she is the source of joy

18:43.710 --> 18:46.140
and she is the peacemaker.

18:46.715 --> 18:49.801
If she is the one who creates problems,

18:50.279 --> 18:54.146
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

18:56.271 --> 18:59.781
So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

19:01.149 --> 19:04.714
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

19:04.836 --> 19:10.212
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

19:10.442 --> 19:14.318
your left Nabhi can never improve.

19:17.199 --> 19:22.017
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

19:22.935 --> 19:26.069
Now in the west the problem with women

19:26.185 --> 19:30.510
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

19:34.684 --> 19:38.901
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

19:39.901 --> 19:44.501
They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

19:44.787 --> 19:47.379
They are the queen of the house

19:48.133 --> 19:51.287
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

19:51.573 --> 19:53.573
young frivolous girl.

19:54.659 --> 19:58.365
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

19:58.834 --> 20:02.593
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

20:03.594 --> 20:07.567
that, does not behove a housewife.

20:07.742 --> 20:10.411
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

20:10.911 --> 20:14.613
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

20:14.781 --> 20:16.791
and when they have to fight.

20:18.111 --> 20:21.312
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

20:21.463 --> 20:25.545
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
that's the limit!

20:29.284 --> 20:32.847
They start always comparing themselves

20:33.387 --> 20:35.471
with the husband, to begin with.

20:35.892 --> 20:40.243
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

20:40.395 --> 20:43.928
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

20:44.098 --> 20:46.473
low family he has no money,

20:46.656 --> 20:49.118
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

20:49.603 --> 20:52.099
Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

20:52.806 --> 20:56.157
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

20:58.361 --> 21:03.252
Also in her own ways

21:03.784 --> 21:05.366
she will feel guilty,

21:05.994 --> 21:09.623
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

21:09.878 --> 21:13.769
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

21:15.173 --> 21:21.493
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

21:23.064 --> 21:26.171
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

21:26.498 --> 21:30.497
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

21:30.640 --> 21:34.013
by your strength, by everything

21:36.383 --> 21:40.473
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

21:42.177 --> 21:46.988
by dominating others, by strangling others,

21:47.615 --> 21:51.580
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

21:55.033 --> 21:57.445
frog in the well.

21:58.556 --> 22:02.428
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

22:02.492 --> 22:04.135
Lets have our house separately,

22:04.246 --> 22:07.328
nobody should come in the house'.
Even a rat won't enter that house.

22:09.461 --> 22:14.460
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

22:16.312 --> 22:20.166
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

22:20.960 --> 22:23.726
is the negative form of understanding.

22:24.337 --> 22:28.087
These are absolutely absurd things,

22:28.199 --> 22:32.779
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

22:34.941 --> 22:37.244
All this kind of selfishness,

22:37.530 --> 22:42.302
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

22:44.886 --> 22:47.658
But a thing of a housewife is,

22:47.801 --> 22:51.287
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

22:51.759 --> 22:55.332
For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

22:55.755 --> 22:57.953
So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.413
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

23:00.893 --> 23:03.413
'But may be they would like to eat more.'

23:04.001 --> 23:06.250
'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

23:06.853 --> 23:09.236
'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

23:09.792 --> 23:13.289
So she thinks of her generosity.

23:13.583 --> 23:15.267
She enjoys her generosity.

23:15.934 --> 23:17.418
I have known many like that.

23:17.553 --> 23:20.457
Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.001
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

23:25.081 --> 23:26.977
will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

23:27.088 --> 23:29.255
you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

23:29.485 --> 23:32.172
No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

23:32.308 --> 23:34.351
Then she just start thinking immediately.

23:34.503 --> 23:37.410
'What vegetables are available in the market?

23:37.712 --> 23:39.817
What should I get? What is the best?'

23:39.976 --> 23:44.824
I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

23:45.021 --> 23:47.245
I am just a relation,

23:48.088 --> 23:51.225
but they want to express their love through the food,

23:51.364 --> 23:56.277
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

23:57.910 --> 24:00.195
and this is one of  the quality,

24:00.286 --> 24:02.695
the generosity for woman doesn't have

24:03.047 --> 24:06.295
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

24:08.068 --> 24:11.556
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

24:14.061 --> 24:16.404
but wife has to be very generous

24:16.547 --> 24:19.213
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

24:20.417 --> 24:23.695
not to her own children but to others.

24:25.684 --> 24:30.020
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

24:31.276 --> 24:34.009
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

24:35.191 --> 24:38.901
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

24:41.367 --> 24:44.606
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

24:45.266 --> 24:49.953
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

24:53.302 --> 24:56.683
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

24:57.128 --> 25:01.425
but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

25:01.708 --> 25:06.940
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

25:08.218 --> 25:10.461
about your own understanding.

25:10.660 --> 25:13.200
You are not aware of yourself.

25:14.563 --> 25:18.959
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

25:19.464 --> 25:23.305
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

25:26.527 --> 25:28.979
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

25:29.122 --> 25:30.844
Alright, leave it for a while.

25:31.021 --> 25:33.208
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

25:33.296 --> 25:36.129
'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

25:38.015 --> 25:40.898
The women must understand the men.

25:41.422 --> 25:44.963
They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.762
They see everything in a big way, you see.

25:49.346 --> 25:53.289
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

25:54.520 --> 25:56.235
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.195
They are too above these things.

25:58.565 --> 26:02.482
They are above these things. You must understand that!

26:04.083 --> 26:08.361
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

26:09.095 --> 26:11.944
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

26:12.508 --> 26:16.099
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

26:18.073 --> 26:20.152
It is coming to that point.

26:20.533 --> 26:23.307
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

26:23.442 --> 26:26.452
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

26:26.556 --> 26:29.129
without any moustaches.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.955
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.871
But there is no subordination of any kind.

26:39.959 --> 26:42.317
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

26:42.501 --> 26:45.756
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

26:46.148 --> 26:48.658
and, above all, to your righteousness

26:49.650 --> 26:53.106
because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

26:54.961 --> 26:57.175
has to look after that side.

26:58.699 --> 27:00.401
How many quarrels you create?

27:00.553 --> 27:04.993
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

27:05.207 --> 27:07.812
Supposing we send two peacemakers

27:08.138 --> 27:11.746
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

27:12.939 --> 27:15.201
what will you say to such a thing?

27:16.912 --> 27:20.191
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

27:21.398 --> 27:25.712
you have  the one who has to bring such

27:27.098 --> 27:31.052
expression of love, such sweet things

27:34.121 --> 27:40.069
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

27:40.604 --> 27:42.587
because you are the mother.

27:43.019 --> 27:45.717
The family must feel secured within you

27:46.656 --> 27:49.960
and this love is your power.

27:52.412 --> 27:55.062
This is your power that you can give love

27:55.493 --> 27:59.940
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

28:01.358 --> 28:04.850
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

28:04.953 --> 28:07.350
I don't know I'll have to build another house!

28:07.551 --> 28:09.788
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

28:09.891 --> 28:11.677
I will not take any individual presents."

28:11.709 --> 28:14.385
Now still despite that. I don't know,

28:14.592 --> 28:20.268
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

28:21.487 --> 28:25.687
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

28:25.798 --> 28:27.911
You are some times surprised.

28:30.172 --> 28:33.894
I'll give you one simple example of my own life

28:34.029 --> 28:37.604
which will tell you how love can work it out.

28:38.223 --> 28:41.544
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.501
And once I was in Delhi,

28:44.755 --> 28:49.640
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

28:49.755 --> 28:51.208
sitting outside in the lawn,

28:51.581 --> 28:55.315
when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

28:55.673 --> 28:57.985
and they came and said, "See now we are...

28:58.223 --> 29:01.606
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

29:01.725 --> 29:04.396
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

29:04.563 --> 29:05.795
and he is a Muslim,

29:05.970 --> 29:09.201
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

29:09.749 --> 29:12.002
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

29:12.098 --> 29:13.312
they were quite alright.

29:13.769 --> 29:16.907
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

29:17.130 --> 29:19.348
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

29:19.452 --> 29:21.533
and a bathroom and this thing,

29:21.700 --> 29:24.180
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

29:24.313 --> 29:26.569
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

29:28.022 --> 29:29.947
In the evening my brother came in.

29:30.099 --> 29:31.947
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

29:32.083 --> 29:33.116
he said "What is this?

29:33.204 --> 29:35.402
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

29:35.624 --> 29:39.644
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

29:39.882 --> 29:41.532
my husband came, he also joined him

29:41.636 --> 29:44.905
because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

29:45.807 --> 29:47.925
All men just the same, you see,

29:48.228 --> 29:50.159
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

29:50.246 --> 29:52.192
she has kept these three persons here.

29:52.359 --> 29:55.297
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

29:55.409 --> 29:57.801
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

29:57.937 --> 30:01.129
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

30:01.256 --> 30:02.758
all kind of things.

30:04.462 --> 30:06.342
Next morning they forgot about that.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.781
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

30:10.321 --> 30:12.268
I can't drag them out today, one night."

30:12.427 --> 30:14.867
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

30:15.208 --> 30:16.289
That's like men!

30:16.385 --> 30:18.353
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

30:18.472 --> 30:21.849
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

30:22.175 --> 30:25.009
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

30:25.653 --> 30:28.038
Next morning they went away for their work.

30:28.141 --> 30:30.736
They had no time. It was, you see,

30:30.848 --> 30:34.365
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

30:34.580 --> 30:37.709
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

30:38.849 --> 30:42.260
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

30:42.629 --> 30:45.806
Then this lady got a job

30:46.846 --> 30:52.344
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

30:52.630 --> 30:57.179
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

30:57.608 --> 31:04.400
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

31:04.861 --> 31:06.666
It had a reflection in Delhi

31:06.746 --> 31:09.079
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

31:09.512 --> 31:13.433
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

31:13.568 --> 31:17.223
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

31:17.551 --> 31:19.368
I said, "No. How can I have?"

31:19.845 --> 31:22.023
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

31:22.294 --> 31:25.208
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

31:25.510 --> 31:27.720
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

31:28.776 --> 31:32.104
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

31:35.849 --> 31:38.628
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

31:38.747 --> 31:41.184
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

31:41.303 --> 31:42.850
because I will not allow you!"

31:42.985 --> 31:45.112
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

31:45.318 --> 31:50.099
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

31:50.237 --> 31:52.144
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

31:52.240 --> 31:54.811
I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

31:55.263 --> 31:56.583
His life was saved.

31:57.088 --> 31:59.556
Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

31:59.698 --> 32:02.691
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

32:04.550 --> 32:07.174
and this lady became a great actress,

32:07.945 --> 32:09.519
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

32:09.686 --> 32:12.201
the one who used to act like a mother?

32:13.675 --> 32:16.852
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

32:18.178 --> 32:20.809
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

32:20.937 --> 32:22.777
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

32:22.984 --> 32:26.146
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

32:26.353 --> 32:28.118
they will just go mad about Me,"

32:28.197 --> 32:30.411
and I said "I have no time for all that."

32:30.753 --> 32:35.560
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

32:35.643 --> 32:36.865
to give them some good films.

32:36.952 --> 32:39.644
But it all made into a farce, later on.

32:39.873 --> 32:42.018
They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

32:42.352 --> 32:46.790
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

32:47.108 --> 32:48.788
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

32:48.868 --> 32:51.010
I have said, I have anything to do with it."

32:52.290 --> 32:57.389
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

32:59.450 --> 33:02.158
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

33:02.246 --> 33:04.946
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

33:05.074 --> 33:07.837
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

33:07.973 --> 33:09.331
You will have to give me Sari.

33:09.419 --> 33:11.173
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

33:11.250 --> 33:13.181
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.024
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

33:15.136 --> 33:17.921
big muhurat is the one where you start it.

33:18.594 --> 33:22.017
So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

33:22.195 --> 33:24.276
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

33:24.396 --> 33:26.064
that she has seen Me after twelve years.

33:26.176 --> 33:28.290
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

33:28.526 --> 33:31.425
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

33:32.084 --> 33:34.031
fell into my arms

33:34.454 --> 33:37.996
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

33:38.147 --> 33:40.149
I have been trying to trace you out."

33:40.413 --> 33:43.606
Then she started describing Me and all.

33:43.749 --> 33:46.537
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

33:46.796 --> 33:49.793
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

33:50.114 --> 33:53.084
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

33:53.195 --> 33:54.885
we'll give our lives for Her!"

33:55.227 --> 33:57.509
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

33:57.621 --> 34:00.250
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

34:00.464 --> 34:01.531
Nothing doing. "

34:01.760 --> 34:02.760
See now,

34:03.168 --> 34:06.399
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

34:06.709 --> 34:10.355
I didn't have so many rights on

34:11.177 --> 34:14.139
my husband's property, or anything,

34:14.243 --> 34:16.403
and my brother another dominating fellow,

34:16.633 --> 34:19.262
both of them put together,

34:19.485 --> 34:21.899
just were about to kill me that night,

34:22.717 --> 34:25.753
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

34:26.555 --> 34:28.845
and then you know when I told my husband

34:28.965 --> 34:31.084
and my brother, they were amazed.

34:31.243 --> 34:33.753
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

34:34.191 --> 34:35.699
and see the change,

34:36.128 --> 34:38.465
how much they have...",

34:39.077 --> 34:41.747
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

34:41.835 --> 34:43.685
no to any charitable institution.

34:43.796 --> 34:45.718
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

34:45.885 --> 34:50.905
And the whole idea of a...

34:51.527 --> 34:56.005
earning and money just toppled down.

34:56.278 --> 34:59.523
And she has acted in many films for charity

35:00.238 --> 35:04.863
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

35:07.789 --> 35:12.418
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

35:13.519 --> 35:15.733
because she herself is charitable.

35:16.511 --> 35:19.148
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

35:20.431 --> 35:22.716
And she can create beauty around her,

35:23.037 --> 35:26.959
in her household, in her family, in her society.

35:27.118 --> 35:28.962
Everywhere. But no!

35:29.131 --> 35:32.583
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

35:33.062 --> 35:37.867
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

35:40.168 --> 35:41.740
[UNCLEAR]

35:41.907 --> 35:45.891
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

35:49.280 --> 35:53.018
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

35:53.129 --> 35:56.212
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

35:56.467 --> 35:58.858
and that they have to be told.

35:59.552 --> 36:01.361
But this is not the way!

36:01.872 --> 36:07.379
There is another way of improving these men, who try to

36:08.944 --> 36:10.196
destroy the women,

36:10.466 --> 36:15.405
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

36:17.904 --> 36:20.466
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

36:20.791 --> 36:23.708
He will never side with men if they are chaste

36:24.081 --> 36:26.942
and do not try to show off their body

36:27.133 --> 36:29.775
and show off their beauty and want to make,

36:30.007 --> 36:32.312
sort of, a capital out of it.

36:35.364 --> 36:39.120
Such women are extremely powerful,

36:40.608 --> 36:43.142
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

36:43.420 --> 36:44.946
when it comes to anything

36:45.097 --> 36:48.607
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

36:49.084 --> 36:50.506
She fought the British.

36:50.713 --> 36:52.453
And the British also

36:52.874 --> 36:55.130
were surprised at her valour and they said that

36:55.257 --> 36:56.854
we had got Jhansi, alright,

36:57.307 --> 37:00.143
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

37:03.245 --> 37:05.673
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

37:05.904 --> 37:09.390
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

37:09.519 --> 37:12.972
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

37:14.072 --> 37:16.892
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

37:17.099 --> 37:20.489
who have been great women, who were housewives.

37:23.868 --> 37:30.634
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

37:30.865 --> 37:32.425
or potential of any energy.

37:32.576 --> 37:35.473
Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.928
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

37:38.206 --> 37:41.407
one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.644
So one has to understand that we are potential

37:44.819 --> 37:48.789
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

37:49.038 --> 37:51.855
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

37:52.102 --> 37:55.686
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

37:56.099 --> 37:58.093
But men are another stupid stuff

37:58.459 --> 38:01.184
because they will not respect a woman

38:01.382 --> 38:03.956
who loves them, who is chaste,

38:04.150 --> 38:07.324
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

38:07.478 --> 38:10.479
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

38:10.646 --> 38:14.101
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

38:14.253 --> 38:17.541
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

38:17.724 --> 38:21.753
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.964
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

38:28.501 --> 38:33.765
What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

38:34.686 --> 38:36.966
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

38:37.248 --> 38:38.700
that the way they get attracted.

38:39.232 --> 38:42.093
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

38:42.355 --> 38:44.507
women become very insecure

38:45.035 --> 38:47.495
and they get insecured. As a result,

38:47.702 --> 38:50.292
the men suffer and women suffer.

38:51.660 --> 38:54.938
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

38:55.298 --> 39:00.387
will consequently get blood cancer.

39:08.408 --> 39:10.606
And the woman who behaves like this,

39:13.121 --> 39:17.511
in this manner and if she ill-treats

39:17.861 --> 39:21.276
her husband, will get asthma

39:21.882 --> 39:27.283
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

39:29.812 --> 39:33.256
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

39:34.850 --> 39:37.874
could be complete dehydration of the body.

39:43.104 --> 39:45.747
Because left nabhi is so important.

39:46.890 --> 39:50.183
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

39:50.366 --> 39:55.050
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

39:55.766 --> 39:59.792
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

40:00.256 --> 40:01.783
I have always seen

40:02.037 --> 40:06.330
that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

40:08.431 --> 40:10.989
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.491
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

40:13.555 --> 40:16.112
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

40:16.300 --> 40:18.638
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

40:19.218 --> 40:22.833
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

40:24.051 --> 40:27.227
He gets something for the jumping

40:27.469 --> 40:31.159
and she gets something for her torturing.

40:31.696 --> 40:36.148
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

40:39.853 --> 40:42.189
This so-called figure madness,

40:42.652 --> 40:45.961
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

40:46.345 --> 40:51.291
It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

40:54.441 --> 40:57.059
Women have to be settled down women.

40:58.303 --> 41:00.303
They have to be Grahasthis,

41:00.535 --> 41:03.026
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

41:03.291 --> 41:05.664
Said to be satisfied with her household.

41:06.183 --> 41:08.097
If she is all the time running about,

41:08.200 --> 41:09.781
she doesn't want to stay in the house

41:09.909 --> 41:14.094
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

41:16.523 --> 41:21.301
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

41:21.531 --> 41:23.716
and then she was made a housewife

41:24.066 --> 41:26.132
but she could not stop her running about

41:26.323 --> 41:28.228
because she was a maid servant.

41:30.106 --> 41:32.021
She doesn't settle in the household.

41:32.299 --> 41:36.198
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

41:36.346 --> 41:39.670
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

41:39.993 --> 41:42.088
but for others to welcome.

41:42.787 --> 41:45.806
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

41:45.917 --> 41:48.250
to come and sit and enjoy.

41:49.345 --> 41:51.810
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

41:51.921 --> 41:54.717
we find that people, after marriage,

41:54.853 --> 41:59.118
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

42:00.608 --> 42:04.260
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

42:04.554 --> 42:07.778
and disobedient, torturesome.

42:08.734 --> 42:12.994
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

42:14.582 --> 42:16.102
Not that I punish this,

42:16.266 --> 42:18.646
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

42:18.755 --> 42:21.697
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

42:21.936 --> 42:24.951
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

42:27.935 --> 42:30.511
Then children become funny.

42:32.305 --> 42:34.621
Just for your family, just for your food,

42:34.730 --> 42:38.249
just for your household, this selfishness,

42:39.489 --> 42:42.655
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

42:42.872 --> 42:45.799
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

42:46.268 --> 42:48.771
but if the man is a gone case,

42:52.423 --> 42:54.773
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

42:54.918 --> 42:58.264
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

42:59.685 --> 43:04.286
Our family is not of one man one woman

43:04.646 --> 43:07.142
but the whole universe is our family.

43:09.522 --> 43:11.894
We are not on our own,

43:12.543 --> 43:16.020
and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

43:16.769 --> 43:19.531
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

43:19.929 --> 43:22.575
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

43:22.942 --> 43:24.377
a day will come,

43:24.579 --> 43:29.108
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

43:29.938 --> 43:34.950
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

43:35.058 --> 43:37.972
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

43:40.855 --> 43:45.125
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

43:45.319 --> 43:49.106
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

43:49.223 --> 43:50.449
group of women,

43:50.674 --> 43:54.757
she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

44:01.571 --> 44:04.334
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

44:04.471 --> 44:08.098
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

44:08.308 --> 44:11.871
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

44:15.792 --> 44:19.096
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

44:19.248 --> 44:22.536
Not because it is a punishment from God.

44:26.192 --> 44:29.691
So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

44:31.393 --> 44:36.238
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

44:36.404 --> 44:40.342
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

44:44.581 --> 44:48.231
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

44:50.624 --> 44:53.611
Those women who have tried such tricks,

44:54.497 --> 44:57.599
should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

44:57.715 --> 44:59.791
Nobody respects such a woman.

45:01.319 --> 45:04.507
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

45:05.827 --> 45:08.105
The leader's wife or the leadership

45:08.221 --> 45:15.779
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

45:16.501 --> 45:18.491
Most insignificant.

45:20.783 --> 45:24.765
What you got is much higher than this.

45:26.805 --> 45:31.681
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

45:32.292 --> 45:34.781
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

45:40.954 --> 45:42.692
Is the minimal of minimal.

45:43.045 --> 45:44.719
Is the lowest of lowest.

45:45.036 --> 45:48.873
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

45:50.372 --> 45:52.933
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

45:55.175 --> 45:58.212
But that service itself is enjoyment.

45:59.401 --> 46:01.355
But if you just keep to service.

46:01.594 --> 46:05.669
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

46:06.713 --> 46:12.195
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

46:12.865 --> 46:15.000
You can be used for a cross!

46:20.167 --> 46:22.487
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

46:22.622 --> 46:26.334
unless and until you have that essence

46:26.461 --> 46:29.862
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

46:31.802 --> 46:36.817
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

46:38.015 --> 46:41.983
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

46:42.476 --> 46:44.272
then what is left?

46:45.352 --> 46:48.474
In the same way, all the so-called service

46:48.577 --> 46:50.952
and seva and tapasya

46:51.175 --> 46:54.439
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

46:56.459 --> 46:59.509
So the essence of all this is sweetness

47:01.079 --> 47:03.642
and that is generated by women.

47:05.681 --> 47:08.038
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

47:08.189 --> 47:10.134
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

47:10.302 --> 47:13.685
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

47:19.218 --> 47:22.638
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

47:23.692 --> 47:25.835
It's a good thing in a way.

47:27.042 --> 47:31.132
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

47:35.553 --> 47:37.761
But to make him all the time slave,

47:37.880 --> 47:40.689
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

47:40.852 --> 47:43.073
Is not the job of a housewife!

47:47.089 --> 47:52.316
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

47:53.554 --> 47:54.919
She gives you everything.

47:55.015 --> 47:58.125
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

47:58.703 --> 48:00.221
Such powers She has.

48:00.380 --> 48:03.301
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

48:03.796 --> 48:07.464
You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

48:07.560 --> 48:11.285
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

48:11.511 --> 48:15.933
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

48:16.056 --> 48:18.643
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

48:18.850 --> 48:20.440
Least expected!

48:22.405 --> 48:24.309
Never in life-time.

48:25.587 --> 48:27.598
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

48:27.804 --> 48:29.891
First time, I said something and see the effect.

48:29.995 --> 48:32.518
Because I've never said him!

48:35.303 --> 48:38.604
So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

48:38.787 --> 48:41.297
satisfied in her self because she has to give.

48:41.396 --> 48:44.277
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

48:44.479 --> 48:47.184
She has to give love because she is love.

48:47.705 --> 48:50.204
She has to give all the services.

48:50.324 --> 48:52.246
She has to give all the possessions,

48:52.389 --> 48:55.701
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

48:55.821 --> 48:57.776
what a responsibility!

48:58.657 --> 49:01.874
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

49:02.044 --> 49:03.774
is the responsibility of a woman,

49:03.909 --> 49:07.102
and she should feel proud of it,
that such a responsibility has come to me.

49:07.833 --> 49:09.205
A housewife

49:09.357 --> 49:12.872
has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

49:13.869 --> 49:18.101
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

49:19.788 --> 49:21.827
because they think they have become leaders.

49:21.978 --> 49:23.544
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

49:23.663 --> 49:27.253
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

49:29.384 --> 49:33.276
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

49:33.855 --> 49:37.836
I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

49:41.770 --> 49:45.241
and each one of them adores Me.

49:45.773 --> 49:48.189
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

49:48.340 --> 49:50.620
all of them will come from all over to see  me

49:50.700 --> 49:53.821
but my husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

49:54.723 --> 49:58.916
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
and they come and see me, not him!

50:01.605 --> 50:03.637
If I had not given them love,

50:03.772 --> 50:06.188
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

50:06.621 --> 50:08.502
they would have not come to Me.

50:09.975 --> 50:14.079
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

50:14.377 --> 50:17.281
They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

50:19.269 --> 50:22.715
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

50:22.850 --> 50:24.480
many stupid women.

50:24.933 --> 50:28.331
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

50:30.496 --> 50:33.464
Because they don't know what power they have got.

50:36.948 --> 50:40.154
They don't know what responsibility they have.

50:41.888 --> 50:44.158
I'm an example before them.

50:48.439 --> 50:52.057
And this is the very big problem with me that practically

50:52.351 --> 50:55.543
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

50:55.735 --> 50:58.166
I must say, horrible.

51:00.680 --> 51:03.235
And Sahaja Yoga goes 'dhup' like that with them.

51:04.263 --> 51:06.183
They can't live in an ashram,

51:06.318 --> 51:09.441
they will have their food,
the husband must see that they have their food.

51:09.560 --> 51:12.388
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

51:12.571 --> 51:16.160
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

51:19.764 --> 51:23.224
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

51:23.375 --> 51:26.297
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

51:29.235 --> 51:30.472
But No, they sit down,

51:30.608 --> 51:33.409
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

51:34.092 --> 51:36.793
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

51:36.928 --> 51:38.788
Just do that! Do this!"

51:43.216 --> 51:45.564
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

51:46.593 --> 51:50.346
Every wife of a leader

51:50.595 --> 51:55.491
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

52:00.260 --> 52:03.053
They have to cook. And with heart.

52:03.525 --> 52:07.619
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

52:08.249 --> 52:10.649
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

52:13.175 --> 52:16.079
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

52:16.354 --> 52:19.372
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

52:19.682 --> 52:22.756
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

52:22.886 --> 52:25.084
encourage their niceness.

52:25.386 --> 52:27.842
Also I have seen, some very good ladies

52:27.914 --> 52:30.796
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

52:30.900 --> 52:32.157
After marriage they are lost.

52:32.221 --> 52:35.426
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

52:37.624 --> 52:41.449
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
otherwise they are not there.

52:42.428 --> 52:46.272
Today I was asking Arnaud,
he told me so many of them are like that here.

52:47.180 --> 52:50.000
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

52:51.408 --> 52:53.725
because before marriage they were better off.

52:55.280 --> 52:59.882
So how much it is important, a Gruhakshmi Principle with in us,

53:00.295 --> 53:02.181
for us to be together,

53:02.444 --> 53:05.634
to us to grow together. To feel the togetherness,

53:05.883 --> 53:08.382
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

53:09.055 --> 53:12.523
So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

53:12.682 --> 53:14.340
the Ragas we have.

53:14.571 --> 53:16.385
Ra is energy.

53:17.219 --> 53:21.025
Ga is in Sanskrit language 'Ga, Gayathi'  means 'which penetrates',

53:21.184 --> 53:22.525
'which moves into everything',

53:23.708 --> 53:26.750
it's the ethereal, etheric qualities.

53:27.637 --> 53:29.581
etheric...... into which you see

53:29.748 --> 53:32.621
You put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

53:33.431 --> 53:37.878
So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

53:39.407 --> 53:41.843
and touches your spirit.

53:43.735 --> 53:45.179
That is the Raga.

53:45.809 --> 53:51.281
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

53:56.330 --> 54:00.385
Supposing if you stand with a military band

54:00.852 --> 54:04.065
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

54:05.903 --> 54:10.000
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

54:10.210 --> 54:15.060
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

54:16.732 --> 54:19.914
The way the housewife decorates the house.

54:20.370 --> 54:24.506
She smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

54:24.717 --> 54:26.662
Then she's looking after everyone.

54:26.742 --> 54:28.861
Everybody knows she is standing there.

54:29.029 --> 54:33.143
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

54:33.406 --> 54:36.964
some people for birthday cake of your child

54:37.218 --> 54:39.293
and you cut the cake first

54:40.238 --> 54:42.185
because you are the housewife.

54:43.051 --> 54:46.649
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

54:47.525 --> 54:50.861
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

54:51.131 --> 54:54.404
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

54:56.401 --> 54:58.420
Look after all of them,

54:59.849 --> 55:04.299
and this is what is a Raga is.

55:04.361 --> 55:08.970
It caters to all your angularities.

55:09.074 --> 55:12.195
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

55:12.283 --> 55:14.952
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

55:15.742 --> 55:17.368
It soothes you down.

55:19.127 --> 55:21.341
It makes you settle down.

55:22.087 --> 55:27.283
Like people come home for five days, live like

55:27.866 --> 55:30.206
I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

55:30.471 --> 55:33.417
and live in a tent-like thing

55:33.568 --> 55:36.666
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

55:37.431 --> 55:39.304
or they go and stay in a hotel.

55:39.709 --> 55:41.950
Nobody wants to stay in the house

55:42.522 --> 55:45.747
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

55:48.512 --> 55:52.104
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

55:52.299 --> 55:55.416
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

55:55.531 --> 55:59.205
Imagine somebody listening to a raga when he's a jumpy.

56:01.495 --> 56:03.219
So, one has to settle down

56:03.624 --> 56:09.042
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

56:09.321 --> 56:10.942
who is a housewife,

56:11.245 --> 56:14.810
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

56:15.408 --> 56:19.187
As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

56:19.309 --> 56:21.269
in the modern times, much more,

56:21.712 --> 56:26.257
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

56:26.650 --> 56:28.641
Is that the wife...

56:29.391 --> 56:32.480
normally in India before, you see,

56:32.560 --> 56:34.848
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

56:35.078 --> 56:37.200
all the time his wife is not with him.

56:37.462 --> 56:40.337
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

56:40.637 --> 56:44.615
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

56:45.330 --> 56:47.864
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

56:48.192 --> 56:49.874
then they have a divorce.

56:50.624 --> 56:53.492
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

56:53.650 --> 56:55.952
household, Sahaja Yoga, things like that.

56:56.447 --> 57:00.020
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

57:00.689 --> 57:03.009
sits on the ground, in India.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.742
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

57:05.845 --> 57:08.767
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

57:08.905 --> 57:13.232
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

57:14.650 --> 57:16.602
Or  "This lady was quarrelling

57:16.722 --> 57:19.390
or I met another lady she was telling me you were this

57:19.504 --> 57:22.694
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

57:23.660 --> 57:25.000
That's why in India

57:25.120 --> 57:27.207
if husband has to show his temper he doesn't eat

57:27.310 --> 57:30.361
his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

57:34.570 --> 57:36.398
That is how, they show their temper.

57:36.652 --> 57:39.604
So then she fans the husband slowly

57:39.806 --> 57:43.458
and tells him good things, you see, today you know why?

57:43.707 --> 57:47.748
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

57:48.450 --> 57:51.308
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes. He said, he said so".

57:51.573 --> 57:54.851
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

57:58.643 --> 58:00.764
but you see all nice things, you see,

58:00.933 --> 58:04.029
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

58:04.191 --> 58:06.260
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

58:06.389 --> 58:07.992
And your sister is coming.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.096
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

58:10.256 --> 58:12.272
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

58:12.518 --> 58:16.740
So he eats his food nicely then he goes washes his hands

58:17.026 --> 58:19.765
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

58:19.950 --> 58:22.086
where there is a jam, always.

58:22.772 --> 58:27.885
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

58:28.326 --> 58:31.573
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

58:31.804 --> 58:34.076
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

58:34.275 --> 58:36.713
that on the periphery of the

58:38.002 --> 58:40.115
wheel you have the speed

58:40.350 --> 58:45.033
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be at the axis,

58:45.781 --> 58:50.156
and so the husband and the wife,
the left and the right side of a chariot

58:50.540 --> 58:52.660
have to be on the axis

58:52.883 --> 58:55.718
and the left is left and the right is right.

58:56.260 --> 58:58.913
Now the women always take more time to get ready.

58:59.064 --> 59:01.399
Not me, I take less than My husband,

59:02.020 --> 59:06.331
much less than my husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

59:06.874 --> 59:10.439
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

59:10.584 --> 59:13.887
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

59:14.094 --> 59:16.270
Men must see their watches ten times.

59:16.694 --> 59:21.275
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

59:21.498 --> 59:23.097
if they are real women.

59:23.415 --> 59:26.567
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

59:26.983 --> 59:30.231
But they are women and you are men,

59:30.422 --> 59:33.336
and God has made men and women.

59:33.585 --> 59:35.483
If it was to make a unisex,

59:35.626 --> 59:38.126
He would have made unisex, He did not.

59:39.499 --> 59:42.811
So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

59:43.034 --> 59:47.705
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

59:48.136 --> 59:50.645
And you must know this is Woman's party!

59:50.993 --> 59:54.042
In India we have this thing like, you know,

59:54.209 --> 59:57.301
I was married in a family,

59:57.388 --> 01:00:00.399
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:03.329
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of my husband,

01:00:03.497 --> 01:00:07.483
so, he told my elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

01:00:07.907 --> 01:00:09.766
my friend come and see Me.

01:00:10.245 --> 01:00:16.039
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for him

01:00:16.241 --> 01:00:19.584
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

01:00:19.823 --> 01:00:23.263
and told his wife that "See that she goes and sees the collector".

01:00:23.639 --> 01:00:25.560
See how beautiful it was,

01:00:29.471 --> 01:00:31.677
how beautiful it was,

01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:36.485
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

01:00:36.597 --> 01:00:40.249
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:46.915
But for this what you need is Pure Intelligence.

01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:51.037
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

01:00:51.334 --> 01:00:54.138
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down her husband.

01:00:54.456 --> 01:00:58.767
If the woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

01:00:59.686 --> 01:01:03.399
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.801
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

01:01:11.182 --> 01:01:15.136
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

01:01:15.319 --> 01:01:18.910
That person is the most sensitive,

01:01:19.403 --> 01:01:21.127
is the most intelligent.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:24.533
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

01:01:25.362 --> 01:01:27.919
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

01:01:28.078 --> 01:01:29.668
so, is better leave it to the book,

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.940
and today let us have the puja

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:33.638
May God Bless You.

01:01:33.745 --> 01:01:35.450
Any questions?

01:01:41.142 --> 01:01:43.801
This means, I'll be spending some money?

01:01:45.217 --> 01:01:48.259
I don't know, there's no chance. I don't know when will spend.

01:01:48.449 --> 01:01:51.068
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

01:01:51.188 --> 01:01:52.822
That's why the money is for.

01:01:52.936 --> 01:01:54.674
Must give to others, you see.

01:01:54.737 --> 01:01:56.793
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

01:01:56.845 --> 01:01:58.737
Just enjoy giving others.

01:01:59.836 --> 01:02:02.423
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
