00:08.285 --> 00:09.698
So,

00:14.640 --> 00:21.180
this last centre, the Sahasrara,

00:21.180 --> 00:27.224
is contained in the limbic area of the brain.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.754
Our head is like a coconut.

00:41.100 --> 00:55.000
The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut
and then a black covering and inside is white

00:57.540 --> 01:06.088
shell of coconut and inside
is the space, the water.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.111
In the same way, our brain is made.

01:13.080 --> 01:27.845
That’s why coconut is called as shriphala,
is the fruit of the power that is Shri.

01:28.920 --> 01:33.376
Shri Power is the right-side power

01:35.640 --> 01:40.300
and the left-side power is the Lalita Power.

01:40.500 --> 01:52.020
So, we have two chakras – left side, here, is the
Lalita and right side, here, is the Shri Chakra.

01:53.160 --> 01:57.737
These two chakras are working out

01:59.760 --> 02:10.860
the right side Mahasaraswati’s power
and left side Mahakali’s powers.

02:10.860 --> 02:16.057
Now, the central power is the Kundalini.

02:17.160 --> 02:27.468
That has to rise and penetrate through
different chakras, enter into the limbic area

02:27.720 --> 02:36.314
and enlighten the seven "pithas"
– seats of these seven chakras.

02:36.660 --> 02:43.421
So, it penetrates through
six chakras, enters into the

02:44.460 --> 02:52.171
limbic area, enlightens all
the seven pithas in the brain,

02:55.260 --> 03:01.301
which are placed along the
mid-line of the limbic area.

03:01.500 --> 03:10.347
So, we start it from the back, is placed
here, at the back, is the Mooladhara Chakra.

03:10.620 --> 03:19.200
Around it is the Swadishthana, then is the Nabhi,

03:20.520 --> 03:27.176
then the Heart, then the
Vishuddhi and then the Agnya.

03:27.360 --> 03:36.253
So, all these six centres are
combining to make the seventh centre.

03:37.620 --> 03:41.943
This is a very important
point, which we should know.

03:42.180 --> 03:49.704
Now, the Shri Chakra is the right side working
and the Lalita Chakra is the left side working.

03:49.980 --> 03:58.920
So, when the Kundalini doesn’t
rise then we do with our right side

04:02.220 --> 04:05.772
our physical and mental activities.

04:05.940 --> 04:14.701
So, our brain is doing right side activity
and that’s why our brain is like shriphala.

04:18.060 --> 04:28.309
Sahasrara is actually is the
assemblage of these six chakras

04:30.960 --> 04:38.144
and is a hollow space, on the sides
of it there are one thousand nadis.

04:38.400 --> 04:50.100
And when the light penetrates into the
limbic area, then the enlightenment of

04:50.100 --> 05:00.435
these nadis take place and you can see
them as flames, very gentle flames burning

05:01.020 --> 05:07.635
and these flames have all the seven colors
that you see in the VIBGYOR [stands for

05:07.635 --> 05:11.760
“Violet–Indigo–Blue–Green–Yellow–Orange–Red”,
for memorizing the optical spectrum].

05:11.760 --> 05:20.340
But the last one, ultimately becomes again
integrated and it is a crystal-clear flame.

05:20.340 --> 05:27.194
All these seven lights
ultimately become crystal clear.

05:28.380 --> 05:34.680
So, you have Sahasrara with one
thousand petals, as they called it,

05:36.480 --> 05:46.680
but if you cut the brain in a transverse section
or horizontal section, you will be able to see

05:46.680 --> 05:56.769
that all these nerves are built like this along
the limbic area, all of them are like a petal.

05:57.060 --> 06:01.500
And if you cut it like this
[horizontally], you will find

06:01.500 --> 06:09.420
that there are many nerves
in every bundle of nerves.

06:11.580 --> 06:18.960
So, when it is enlightened,
you can see Sahasrara as a

06:23.400 --> 06:26.220
burning bundle of flames.

06:27.060 --> 06:36.127
So, when the enlightenment of the
Kundalini takes place in the brain,

06:39.120 --> 06:45.962
then the truth is perceived through your brain.

06:46.440 --> 06:52.514
That’s why it’s called as “satya kanda”
[truth; bulb], means you start seeing the truth

06:52.680 --> 07:04.038
perceived by your brain because so far whatever
you see through your brain, is not the truth.

07:04.380 --> 07:11.010
What you see, is just the outer
side, say, you can see the colours.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.607
You can see the different
aesthetics of the colours.

07:15.780 --> 07:19.801
You can see the quality of the thing.

07:19.920 --> 07:29.409
But you cannot say whether this
carpet has been used by some saint.

07:30.720 --> 07:38.019
You cannot say whether this is
made by a devil or a divine person.

07:38.400 --> 07:47.870
You cannot say that this gentleman, is
he a good person or he is an evil person.

07:48.420 --> 07:56.814
You cannot say if this Deity has
come out of the Mother Earth or not.

07:57.300 --> 08:13.380
Also, you cannot say about any person,
who is your relation, whether he is a

08:15.360 --> 08:23.280
good relation or a bad relation, or what sort
of a person he is, whether he goes to wrong

08:23.280 --> 08:31.707
people or to the right people, whether he has
connections with wrong side or with good side.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.061
Here good means Divine.

08:34.200 --> 08:40.985
So actually, you do not know anything
about divinity with your mind, nothing.

08:41.280 --> 08:47.820
Nothing – is impossible for you to judge
a person about his divinity unless and

08:47.820 --> 08:53.223
until the Kundalini reaches at least
this part, which is the limbic area.

08:53.520 --> 09:02.323
You cannot make out whether a person is
real or not, whether a guru is real or not.

09:02.640 --> 09:08.799
Because divinity cannot be
perceived through your brain,

09:09.300 --> 09:16.283
unless and until this light
of your Spirit shines into it.

09:18.360 --> 09:23.820
Now, the Spirit is expressed in the
heart, is reflected in the heart,

09:23.820 --> 09:27.704
the centre of the Spirit,
we can say, is in the heart.

09:27.960 --> 09:33.066
But actually, the seat of Spirit is above, here.

09:33.360 --> 09:39.720
And that is the Spirit what we call of
the God Almighty, Who say, Whom you call

09:44.047 --> 09:47.640
Parvardigar [Persian word],

09:47.640 --> 09:57.877
you call Him Sadashiva or
you can call Him, the Rahim

09:59.040 --> 10:10.440
and you can call Him by many names which
are said about the Lord who is God Almighty.

10:12.360 --> 10:21.120
Niranjan, they call It, Nirankar, every
sort of words which start with Nira, Nihi.

10:21.120 --> 10:32.793
Now, at every centre in the body
you’ll receive a different type of joy.

10:34.920 --> 10:40.260
Every centre has a different type
of joy and there are names for every

10:40.260 --> 10:45.704
types of joy you receive at every
centre when the Kundalini rises.

10:45.840 --> 10:54.850
But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahasrara,
then the joy you receive is called as Nirananda,

10:55.440 --> 10:57.020
Nirananda.

10:57.180 --> 11:01.260
Now, Nee means nothing else but Ananda.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.100
Nirananda.

11:06.420 --> 11:12.440
Also, is surprising, my name is Nira –
also, in my family I’m called as Nira.

11:13.403 --> 11:17.403
And Nira also means Mary, Maria.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.952
Because it means marine.

11:18.952 --> 11:21.030
Nira is water.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.940
Nira means water in Sanskrit language.

11:23.940 --> 11:28.000
It is called as Nirananda in the brain.

11:28.680 --> 11:33.385
And this stage ultimately unfolds.
