00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:09.698
So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.180
this last centre, the Sahasrara,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.224
is contained in the limbic area of the brain.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.754
Our head is like a coconut.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:55.000
The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut&nbsp;
and then a black covering and inside is white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:06.088
shell of coconut and inside&nbsp;
is the space, the water.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.111
In the same way, our brain is made.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:27.845
That’s why coconut is called as shriphala,&nbsp;
is the fruit of the power that is Shri.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.376
Shri Power is the right-side power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.300
and the left-side power is the Lalita Power.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:52.020
So, we have two chakras – left side, here, is the&nbsp;
Lalita and right side, here, is the Shri Chakra.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.737
These two chakras are working out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.860
the right side Mahasaraswati’s power&nbsp;
and left side Mahakali’s powers.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.057
Now, the central power is the Kundalini.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:27.468
That has to rise and penetrate through&nbsp;
different chakras, enter into the limbic area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.314
and enlighten the seven "pithas"&nbsp;
– seats of these seven chakras.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.421
So, it penetrates through&nbsp;
six chakras, enters into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:52.171
limbic area, enlightens all&nbsp;
the seven pithas in the brain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.301
which are placed along the&nbsp;
mid-line of the limbic area.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.347
So, we start it from the back, is placed&nbsp;
here, at the back, is the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:19.200
Around it is the Swadishthana, then is the Nabhi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.176
then the Heart, then the&nbsp;
Vishuddhi and then the Agnya.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.253
So, all these six centres are&nbsp;
combining to make the seventh centre.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.943
This is a very important&nbsp;
point, which we should know.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.704
Now, the Shri Chakra is the right side working&nbsp;
and the Lalita Chakra is the left side working.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.920
So, when the Kundalini doesn’t&nbsp;
rise then we do with our right side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.772
our physical and mental activities.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:14.701
So, our brain is doing right side activity&nbsp;
and that’s why our brain is like shriphala.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:28.309
Sahasrara is actually is the&nbsp;
assemblage of these six chakras&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.144
and is a hollow space, on the sides&nbsp;
of it there are one thousand nadis.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:50.100
And when the light penetrates into the&nbsp;
limbic area, then the enlightenment of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.100 --> 00:05:00.435
these nadis take place and you can see&nbsp;
them as flames, very gentle flames burning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.635
and these flames have all the seven colors&nbsp;
that you see in the VIBGYOR [stands for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:11.760
“Violet–Indigo–Blue–Green–Yellow–Orange–Red”,&nbsp;
for memorizing the optical spectrum].

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:20.340
But the last one, ultimately becomes again&nbsp;
integrated and it is a crystal-clear flame.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.194
All these seven lights&nbsp;
ultimately become crystal clear.&nbsp;

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.680
So, you have Sahasrara with one&nbsp;
thousand petals, as they called it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:46.680
but if you cut the brain in a transverse section&nbsp;
or horizontal section, you will be able to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:56.769
that all these nerves are built like this along&nbsp;
the limbic area, all of them are like a petal.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.500
And if you cut it like this&nbsp;
[horizontally], you will find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.420
that there are many nerves&nbsp;
in every bundle of nerves.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.960
So, when it is enlightened,&nbsp;
you can see Sahasrara as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.220
burning bundle of flames.&nbsp;

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:36.127
So, when the enlightenment of the&nbsp;
Kundalini takes place in the brain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.962
then the truth is perceived through your brain.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.514
That’s why it’s called as “satya kanda”&nbsp;
[truth; bulb], means you start seeing the truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:04.038
perceived by your brain because so far whatever&nbsp;
you see through your brain, is not the truth.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:11.010
What you see, is just the outer&nbsp;
side, say, you can see the colours.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.607
You can see the different&nbsp;
aesthetics of the colours.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.801
You can see the quality of the thing.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:29.409
But you cannot say whether this&nbsp;
carpet has been used by some saint.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.019
You cannot say whether this is&nbsp;
made by a devil or a divine person.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:47.870
You cannot say that this gentleman, is&nbsp;
he a good person or he is an evil person.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:56.814
You cannot say if this Deity has&nbsp;
come out of the Mother Earth or not.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:13.380
Also, you cannot say about any person,&nbsp;
who is your relation, whether he is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:23.280
good relation or a bad relation, or what sort&nbsp;
of a person he is, whether he goes to wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:31.707
people or to the right people, whether he has&nbsp;
connections with wrong side or with good side.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.061
Here good means Divine.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.985
So actually, you do not know anything&nbsp;
about divinity with your mind, nothing.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.820
Nothing – is impossible for you to judge&nbsp;
a person about his divinity unless and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:53.223
until the Kundalini reaches at least&nbsp;
this part, which is the limbic area.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:02.323
You cannot make out whether a person is&nbsp;
real or not, whether a guru is real or not.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.799
Because divinity cannot be&nbsp;
perceived through your brain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:16.283
unless and until this light&nbsp;
of your Spirit shines into it.&nbsp;

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.820
Now, the Spirit is expressed in the&nbsp;
heart, is reflected in the heart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.704
the centre of the Spirit,&nbsp;
we can say, is in the heart.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.066
But actually, the seat of Spirit is above, here.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.720
And that is the Spirit what we call of&nbsp;
the God Almighty, Who say, Whom you call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:47.640
Parvardigar [Persian word],&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:57.877
you call Him Sadashiva or&nbsp;
you can call Him, the Rahim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:10.440
and you can call Him by many names which&nbsp;
are said about the Lord who is God Almighty.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:21.120
Niranjan, they call It, Nirankar, every&nbsp;
sort of words which start with Nira, Nihi.&nbsp;

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:32.793
Now, at every centre in the body&nbsp;
you’ll receive a different type of joy.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.260
Every centre has a different type&nbsp;
of joy and there are names for every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.704
types of joy you receive at every&nbsp;
centre when the Kundalini rises.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:54.850
But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahasrara,&nbsp;
then the joy you receive is called as Nirananda,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.020
Nirananda.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.260
Now, Nee means nothing else but Ananda.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.100
Nirananda.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:12.440
Also, is surprising, my name is Nira –&nbsp;
also, in my family I’m called as Nira.

00:11:13.403 --> 00:11:17.403
And Nira also means Mary, Maria.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.952
Because it means marine.

00:11:18.952 --> 00:11:21.030
Nira is water.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.940
Nira means water in Sanskrit language.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.000
It is called as Nirananda in the brain.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.385
And this stage ultimately unfolds.
