00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:17.208
Let him put Mangala Sutra.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.583
Shri Ganesha has the power to give Mangala Sutra.

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:43.999
Make Me wear this one. Come along.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.417
Thanks.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.166
You have the greatest right.

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:10.000
He turned the other way round,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.417
it is used this way when

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:15.166
there is the first year of the marriage - you see,

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:19.291
thats right, that's how it is put.

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:27.417
Just married women.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.417
Married women have to do. Allright.

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:39.542
All the married women and then the kanya

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:41.917
has to do something else.

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:46.875
All of you,

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:50.959
let us have two each otherwise it would be allright.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:56.542
You can mix them up, no harm.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.667
Wait for all the married women.

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:07.792
You come along.

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:24.291
So here we go.

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.500
I didn't bring all My ornaments...

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:14.917
That's good.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:16.500
May God bless you all.

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:19.000
Akhanda saubhagya.

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:25.583
This is the blessing given to all the married women

00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:32.000
that let your saubhagya remain all your life

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.083
without any obstacles.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:47.250
No obstacles in your married life should be all the time there

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:49.583
till you live.

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:52.208
May God bless you

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.750
Now for the kumkum.

00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:10.166
You people can come,

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.542
and married girls can come!

00:10:13.792 --> 00:10:15.250
Keep a little bit for everyone

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.583
and take it round

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:18.625
and they can put it on their hands and rub it.

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:20.166
It's good for them.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.709
Gregoire, you read your names that you have made,

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:11.959
where are your names?

00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:14.709
Gregoire asks "For Shri Shiva or Shri Mahakali?"

00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:18.917
Yes... .Shri Shiva...

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:29.041
All this is for His enjoyment only, isn't it?

00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:07.792
Again!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.041
Gregoire: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Nav Jerusalemeshwara -

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.500
Gregoire: He is the Lord of New Jerusalem

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:26.834
Gregoire: He is the Primordial Self of Shri Mataji.

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.125
Gregoire: He is fond of Sahaja yogis

00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:41.208
So this means that He is the Beloved of the Sahaja yogis,

00:16:42.417 --> 00:16:46.417
Gregoire: This is another name, there is another name, Mother, for this,

00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:05.041
Priya Bhakta, so Priya is first but if you put it last,

00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:09.542
you see - Bhakta Priya means He's fond of bhaktas,

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:11.625
you see, Bhakta Priya.

00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:17.667
But supposing you put it that She is the Beloved,

00:17:17.667 --> 00:17:20.291
you see because Priya, where you put it,

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:27.417
you see, then it is My name- I am the Beloved.

00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:38.875
You can switch it - Premi would be better

00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:43.417
if you put Premi then it would be all right.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.875
You can put it, Priya will be - Gregoire -

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:17.291
Sahaja Yogi Priya it's all right,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.750
but if you put it "Priyaa" then immediately it means

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:23.625
just the other way round because you are addressing,

00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:27.083
you are making the thing according to Me

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:31.166
I become that deity, you see?

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:36.333
Sanskrit is tremendous,

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:38.917
little change here and there and makes such a thing

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:43.667
because every, every consonant, every vowel has a meaning,

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:48.166
can you immagine every consonant and every vowel

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:51.999
has a meaning and has a mantra because it is a devanandra,

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.041
it is understood only by the devas,

00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:56.333
devanand created by the devas,

00:18:56.333 --> 00:18:59.999
so all these have such a tremendous effect when you combine

00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:02.041
all these things, you see.

00:19:04.542 --> 00:19:06.417
Yogi: I'll read some more names for You Shri Mataji?

00:19:06.417 --> 00:19:07.166
Allright.

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:07.667
Good, beautiful, yes

00:28:19.875 --> 00:28:22.875
The same form in that photograph has come up as light,

00:28:22.875 --> 00:28:24.625
have you seen that?

00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:27.875
Just like a flame, this form.

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:31.458
Oil, Amla, Amla oil?

00:32:44.166 --> 00:32:48.750
I saw some Khus, Gregoire,

00:32:48.999 --> 00:32:51.667
in your bathroom I saw some khus,

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.959
is khus perfiume.

00:32:58.166 --> 00:32:59.999
Khus.

00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:13.208
I saw one, it has to be "Athar",

00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:14.959
you see from India because

00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:17.875
let see this one is also "Mogra"...

00:33:30.959 --> 00:33:35.500
Here the kind of perfumes people use are very dangerous,

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.583
especially this "Tabac' is coming from tobacco,

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:41.625
you see sort of people get addicted to it,

00:33:41.917 --> 00:33:44.500
because it is an addiction.

00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:58.250
Yes, this is all right, this is all right. This is hina

00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:09.834
is it written "hina' on that? "Khus, same thing..

00:34:11.709 --> 00:34:14.041
Just the same. This is allright.

00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:30.125
You can apply to all the sahaja yogis, this perfume khus.

00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:37.250
It is clearing for your vishuddhi,

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.542
right vishuddhi especially.

00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:43.667
Though if you have hina that is the best

00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:47.083
because that clears out your right vishuddhi very much,

00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:51.250
but this is good for people who are speedy, heated up...

00:38:38.417 --> 00:38:42.458
Let he do it when I hold the sword.

00:38:42.875 --> 00:38:45.792
I will hold the sword in this hand (hindi)

00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:02.125
108 Names.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.583
Have we got copies of 108 names.

00:39:07.875 --> 00:39:09.750
But you can translate it.

00:52:56.375 --> 00:53:01.458
Yogi: It's my wife who selected it, I am innocent.

00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:06.458
You selected it but put the blame on her.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.291
That's why the wives are there to take all the blame

00:53:17.583 --> 00:53:20.458
Have to open it the other way round,

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.417
open half,

00:53:26.417 --> 00:53:31.583
that's how, fold it that side

00:55:10.375 --> 00:55:14.750
This is the way they had it at the time of Shri Krishna

00:55:31.834 --> 00:55:39.250
Take off My hair from the back and put out My hair.

00:56:37.291 --> 00:56:39.625
She's not have the modern watch...

00:57:54.583 --> 00:58:00.583
Best combination is green, orange and yellow

00:59:11.834 --> 00:59:14.625
Flowers are the best above the head...

00:59:54.208 --> 00:59:56.875
The sign of beauty is that you cannot

00:59:56.875 --> 00:59:59.625
tolerate any imperfection anymore.

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:03.375
This is very beautiful so you must make everything

01:00:03.625 --> 01:00:07.667
in relation to that, is to be done. It's done very well.

01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:41.417
Try to take complete photographs.

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:57.625
This I don't need!

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.083
You can read that in a stotra words

01:21:41.083 --> 01:21:53.333
Stand, it has to go down

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:06.667
May God bless you all, give yourself a bandhan

01:32:02.208 --> 01:32:04.208
Say Lord's prayer

01:32:42.166 --> 01:32:43.667
Once more

01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:23.542
Once more
