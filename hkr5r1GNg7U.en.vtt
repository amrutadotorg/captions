00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:35.886
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:45.396
It was a thing of great joy to Me to come
to Sheffield again.

00:07:45.396 --> 00:07:53.086
Always this name Sheffield created a kind
of a mystery in My mind.

00:07:53.086 --> 00:08:00.306
The word Sheffield could be the ‘She Field’
and She is the Mother energy, the energy within

00:08:00.306 --> 00:08:08.676
you which creates this field within you and
is in the Gita.

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:17.726
Shri Krishna has talked about the field that
we all have a Pradesh - is the field but Desh

00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:23.606
means the field and the enlightened one is
the Pradesh.

00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:29.755
And that same thing happens to us when this
Kundalini rises within you.

00:08:29.755 --> 00:08:38.086
This Holy Ghost which is described in the
bible, She is the Kundalini, She is the Mother.

00:08:38.086 --> 00:08:45.466
Actually people don’t know anything about
Holy Ghost and we didn’t give Christ much

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:48.116
chance to speak about it.

00:08:48.116 --> 00:08:51.506
He could only speak for three and a half years,
is nothing.

00:08:51.506 --> 00:09:00.866
I can tell you three and a half years in this
land anywhere in the whole world it’s so

00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:08.376
difficult even to convince four people that
they have to seek the truth, it’s very difficult.

00:09:08.376 --> 00:09:11.776
Especially in the land where He was born.

00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:14.826
It was full of ignorance, complete ignorance.

00:09:14.826 --> 00:09:23.126
And in that ignorance to speak about realization,
to speak about second birth, even to speak

00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:26.956
about God was so difficult.

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:32.237
And He was just crucified for nothing at all,
today we may have big organizations in His

00:09:32.237 --> 00:09:38.056
name but when He lived nobody listened to
Him and they crucified Him.

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:45.576
He talked about Holy Ghost but this Holy Ghost
had been interpreted by people in various

00:09:45.576 --> 00:09:46.576
ways.

00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:51.475
They’ve never been able to say what is this
Holy Ghost but logically you can come to some

00:09:51.475 --> 00:09:57.145
conclusion yourselves because you’re all
intelligent people.

00:09:57.145 --> 00:09:59.966
We talk about the Father, all right, and then
the Son.

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:05.885
Have you heard of a father producing a son?

00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:07.656
You have to have the Mother.

00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:10.926
It’s the Mother who creates the Son.

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:18.056
Now why this Holy Ghost was kept as a secret,
never talked about it because Christ was afraid

00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:24.035
– not afraid but was cautious I should say,
because such people are never afraid of anything.

00:10:24.035 --> 00:10:32.406
He was cautious to talk about His Mother because
if they had harmed His Mother by any chance,

00:10:32.406 --> 00:10:39.885
then He had eleven powers of destruction and
the destruction of world would have come much

00:10:39.885 --> 00:10:41.676
earlier than today.

00:10:41.676 --> 00:10:48.296
He had to play the whole drama of His crucifixion
and that’s how He had to go through all

00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:49.296
that.

00:10:49.296 --> 00:10:52.406
In that process He didn’t want to involve
His Mother.

00:10:52.406 --> 00:10:58.396
He didn’t want to explain about Holy Ghost
and He knew that it will be later on explained.

00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:02.815
But logically we must understand what is this
Holy Ghost we are talking about?

00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:03.815
[A dove?]

00:11:03.815 --> 00:11:04.815
All right, it’s peace.

00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:07.216
How do you get to the peace?

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:09.216
Supposing it is the symbol of peace.

00:11:09.216 --> 00:11:19.005
Today we see in the world we see these televisions
and we hear, we read newspapers and we are

00:11:19.005 --> 00:11:25.376
shattered and so much of friction, so much
of sin.

00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:30.936
People are not even worried about what they
are doing, to what extent human beings can

00:11:30.936 --> 00:11:39.326
go you can see the way a three year-old child
was molested, the innocence is attacked like

00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:40.326
this.

00:11:40.326 --> 00:11:41.326
Why?

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.076
Why human beings cannot control their desires
which are so devilish?

00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:47.876
Why there is so much of friction in this world?

00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:54.716
We have to think about it and we must also
think positively what we can do about it.

00:11:54.716 --> 00:12:00.417
Now at the same time there are so many seekers
of truth born on this earth.

00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:03.886
This is the special time and that’s why
they are born on this earth.

00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:10.676
But they are misled, they go to wrong people,
they get identified with wrong people.

00:12:10.676 --> 00:12:18.906
When I came here, the person who is organizing
Sahaja Yoga here told Me that, “Mother,

00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:23.496
they come, they get their realization and
then they disappear, they start doubting.”

00:12:23.496 --> 00:12:26.456
I said, “That’s a good sign, it’s a
healthy sign.”

00:12:26.456 --> 00:12:31.826
Let them doubt because the way they jump into
all these horrible things like gurus and this

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:36.686
and that, the way they accept as if they have
no personality, they have no discretion.

00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:43.496
The way they jump into even drugs I don’t
know, what happens that we have lost all our

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:44.496
personality.

00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:52.146
They took to any fashion, to any nonsense
so easily and to reality with such difficulty.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:57.906
We have lost our discretion that’s what
it is, but doesn’t matter whatever it is

00:12:57.906 --> 00:12:59.556
use your brains.

00:12:59.556 --> 00:13:03.716
Understand that this world is not created
to be destroyed.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:09.656
You’re not created out of amoeba just to
be destroyed by something nonsensical like

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:15.326
drug(s) or some sort of a guru; nobody has
right to destroy you.

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:21.556
They cannot create you and they cannot destroy
you, nor you have any right to destroy yourself

00:13:21.556 --> 00:13:28.206
because you cannot create yourself, the one
who is your Creator, the one who has loved

00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:38.466
you who has so beautifully made this beautiful
human life is responsible.

00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:43.996
He is the one who is so earnest about it that
you should get your realization, that you

00:13:43.996 --> 00:13:50.026
should get your second birth, that you should
be baptized in the real sense of the word.

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:59.416
I agree religions have shown funny things,
some thing so absurd that one can start doubting

00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:00.506
their credibility.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:07.116
I admit that, but that is the mistake of human
beings not of the divine.

00:14:07.116 --> 00:14:13.656
Divine created beautiful flowers on the same
tree of life time and time again but when

00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:18.396
the people plucked these flowers and said,
“These are mine, these are mine.”

00:14:18.396 --> 00:14:26.116
They became dead and ugly and they are fighting
now in the name of God, in the name of religion.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:36.776
Imagine, how can you do such merciless, horrible,
brutal things to other human beings but this

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:41.486
must shatter you, this must make you understand
and you should be aware.

00:14:41.486 --> 00:14:48.026
Get out of your sleep now and know that you
are the people who are seekers.

00:14:48.026 --> 00:14:53.626
You have to be more aware, more understanding
of your responsibility.

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:58.196
It is no use standing there with a banner
saying we want peace.

00:14:58.196 --> 00:14:59.196
How?

00:14:59.196 --> 00:15:00.966
The peace has to be within.

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.236
Human beings are not at peace.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:09.456
You see in the art you see today the art has
left the Divine behind, the art has become

00:15:09.456 --> 00:15:13.856
so, chaotic.

00:15:13.856 --> 00:15:19.486
The expression of esthetics are just missing
there’s no beauty in it.

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:26.906
You feel the chaotic heart of an artist being
expressed in that what he’s made, why?

00:15:26.906 --> 00:15:29.056
Because he has lost himself.

00:15:29.056 --> 00:15:36.736
Now it is the responsibility of you people
living in these modern times to become that,

00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:44.526
that source of peace, which is your Spirit,
and the Spirit resides within you.

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:51.056
It is all the time there it is the witness
of this field I should say the She Field,

00:15:51.056 --> 00:15:57.206
the field that is to be enlightened by this
Kundalini that exists within you but is not

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:01.046
enlightened, it has not come into your attention.

00:16:01.046 --> 00:16:05.565
The Spirit has not come into your attention,
that’s why we think this is all talk.

00:16:05.565 --> 00:16:11.765
There are people who are so called intellectuals;
they say this is all talk, talk, talk.

00:16:11.765 --> 00:16:21.516
For a mental conception it is impossible to
tell what lies beyond it because mind is a

00:16:21.516 --> 00:16:22.516
limited thing.

00:16:22.516 --> 00:16:26.796
You have to go beyond mind; you have to be
triggered into the space to see that.

00:16:26.796 --> 00:16:33.165
The evolution has been just like your spacecraft
going into the space.

00:16:33.165 --> 00:16:41.446
First, the first thing comes up is the physical
being, explodes gets its accelerations then

00:16:41.446 --> 00:16:47.756
becomes your mental being, your emotional
being, your spiritual being and then it has

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:51.375
to go to the space.

00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:53.846
That is the time today is the space age.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:17:00.516
When we talk of the space age you think of
the space, which is beyond this gravity, there

00:17:00.516 --> 00:17:07.745
is some space, which is beyond all gravities,
beyond all temptations, beyond all slaveries.

00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:11.946
We talk of our freedom, where is the freedom
I just don’t think see.

00:17:11.946 --> 00:17:15.725
Anybody comes now and says all right, have
this drug for so much money.

00:17:15.725 --> 00:17:17.966
We are finished with it.

00:17:17.966 --> 00:17:22.526
Anybody comes and says all right, you take
up your clothes this way, live like this,

00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:27.946
we just accept without thinking, without understanding.

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:33.086
We have given up the traditions alright whatever
was wrong in the tradition should have been

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:38.966
given no doubt but everything if you give
up then remember we are falling down.

00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:41.985
We are coming down we are not going up.

00:17:41.985 --> 00:17:45.375
When you are going up you do not give up the
staircase.

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:49.595
Staircase is there and you go up higher and
higher.

00:17:49.595 --> 00:17:57.245
No tradition is so bad is to be discarded
but if it is so it should be discarded but

00:17:57.245 --> 00:18:03.735
that is what is the discretion and that discretion
is so much lacking today that people can’t

00:18:03.735 --> 00:18:12.146
see that what we are doing collectively or
individually is not constructive.

00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:18.946
Now I would say that this is not the time
for us just to sit back on the fence and see

00:18:18.946 --> 00:18:21.235
which side we fall.

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:25.346
Either you will fall into hell or you’ll
go to heaven.

00:18:25.346 --> 00:18:31.065
This is the situation, we are so precariously
placed, I do not want to frighten you because

00:18:31.065 --> 00:18:37.555
there is the Spirit within you just to be
enlightened, it’s your own, it is there,

00:18:37.555 --> 00:18:39.846
it’s your own property.

00:18:39.846 --> 00:18:45.446
It’s not Mine, it’s yours, it’s your
own treasure within you.

00:18:45.446 --> 00:18:48.416
Only this treasure is to be exposed to you.

00:18:48.416 --> 00:18:50.735
Now for that how can you pay?

00:18:50.735 --> 00:18:53.716
First thing you must know you cannot pay for
it.

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:58.055
If I say that then all the gurus are after
My life, they want to kill Me, they want to

00:18:58.055 --> 00:18:59.526
do all those things.

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:02.726
You cannot take money for God’s work.

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:05.656
We sold Christ, you know that.

00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:08.526
He didn’t take any money, did He?

00:19:08.526 --> 00:19:13.556
We have got such a great personality like
Christ and we just want to discard Him, make

00:19:13.556 --> 00:19:18.286
fun of Him, say all kinds of things about
Him, intellectualize Him, organize Him.

00:19:18.286 --> 00:19:19.815
You cannot touch Him.

00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:25.045
You’re still human beings, you have to be
the Spirit to understand that Great Soul which

00:19:25.045 --> 00:19:26.055
came on this earth.

00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:31.326
In the same way any other soul, which was
an Incarnation who came on this earth, cannot

00:19:31.326 --> 00:19:40.666
be understood by our normal understanding,
but only a person with that pure intelligence

00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:46.446
can see this point that I’m not satisfied
with what I am, I have to go beyond.

00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:52.345
There’s some transformation needed and how
will this transformation take place?

00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:58.526
We can’t do anything about it because we
have done nothing to become human beings did

00:19:58.526 --> 00:20:00.176
we?

00:20:00.176 --> 00:20:02.776
What did we do to become human beings?

00:20:02.776 --> 00:20:09.446
Nothing, so going beyond also must be built
in within us.

00:20:09.446 --> 00:20:15.966
The way we became human beings there must
be some built-in process by which we will

00:20:15.966 --> 00:20:18.576
become that higher being.

00:20:18.576 --> 00:20:24.326
Now the problem at the human level is that
somebody has to talk at human level.

00:20:24.326 --> 00:20:31.805
Say at the fish level, one fish had to come
up so the others could follow that fish.

00:20:31.805 --> 00:20:37.055
At human level, some human being has to tell
you about it.

00:20:37.055 --> 00:20:39.185
That’s how Christ came on this earth.

00:20:39.185 --> 00:20:46.805
I mean we have a quite a long traditional
history of all these great people came on

00:20:46.805 --> 00:20:49.896
this earth at different places, at different
times.

00:20:49.896 --> 00:20:54.526
According to the time they had to talk.

00:20:54.526 --> 00:21:01.896
When they talked say, about the flowers, say
they talked that they are Gods, like Socrates

00:21:01.896 --> 00:21:05.886
talked about Gods, like Confucius talked about
Gods.

00:21:05.886 --> 00:21:09.795
When they talked we have to please our gods
we started doubting.

00:21:09.795 --> 00:21:12.336
What god’s he’s talking about?

00:21:12.336 --> 00:21:16.915
Whatever they saw we could not see, all right.

00:21:16.915 --> 00:21:19.386
Then they thought no use talking about gods.

00:21:19.386 --> 00:21:25.006
If you talk about gods then it becomes a sort
of a worship of something that is a flower.

00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:29.586
We talk about flowers then we think we have
become God and we talk about flower all the

00:21:29.586 --> 00:21:30.896
time.

00:21:30.896 --> 00:21:33.836
But we have to get to the honey.

00:21:33.836 --> 00:21:35.076
How do we do it?

00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:41.815
So they said, “All right, don’t talk about
God, talk about abstract, talk about the fragrance,

00:21:41.815 --> 00:21:43.185
talk about the honey itself.”

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:49.036
But how do you become, how do you get to the
honey?

00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:54.215
By talking about it again it became a talk
and talk and talk.

00:21:54.215 --> 00:22:03.155
So how it has to happen that you have to become
the bee, the transformation has to take place.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:09.415
First understand this simple point that some
transformation has to take place within us

00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:20.155
to go or to penetrate into that unknown divine
which we call as collective unconscious.

00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:24.926
Something has to happen to us that we have
to become subtler beings.

00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:31.845
Don’t be satisfied and don’t self certify
yourself that “I’m all right; nothing

00:22:31.845 --> 00:22:32.975
wrong with me.”

00:22:32.975 --> 00:22:34.815
No, nothing’s wrong with you.

00:22:34.815 --> 00:22:38.846
Y0ou’re all right, but you have still to
be connected to the mains.

00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:44.055
Like this instrument, if it is not connected
to the mains it won’t work.

00:22:44.055 --> 00:22:50.565
It is as simple as this instrument that you
are to be connected with the mains and for

00:22:50.565 --> 00:22:55.776
that you have got built-in process that has
to work out.

00:22:55.776 --> 00:23:01.826
It’s nice we have instruments in these modern
times that I can use them as an analogies

00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:04.225
to explain to you.

00:23:04.225 --> 00:23:10.466
For others they had to use the analogies of
the seed that how we imbed the seed in the

00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:16.685
Mother Earth and the Mother Earth has the
capacity to sprout the seed and the seed has

00:23:16.685 --> 00:23:21.305
the built-in map of all the trees it is going
to create.

00:23:21.305 --> 00:23:26.495
Now if you look at the seed do you see the
miracle behind the little seed there?

00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:30.985
In India we have huge big banyan trees and
if you see the seed is so small that it’s

00:23:30.985 --> 00:23:36.396
quite microscopic and it makes huge big banyan
trees.

00:23:36.396 --> 00:23:37.475
How does it make?

00:23:37.475 --> 00:23:38.696
We never wonder.

00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:44.175
Whatever is the wonder, the mystery of this
creation we never wonder about it, we never

00:23:44.175 --> 00:23:47.475
look at it, look at ourselves, what are we?

00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:51.095
We are human beings, these eyes, can we make
eyes like this.

00:23:51.095 --> 00:23:55.826
We are making computers, but look at this
brain the computer that is within, we don’t

00:23:55.826 --> 00:23:57.915
have to program it nothing it just knows.

00:23:57.915 --> 00:24:03.076
You know I’m sitting here, I know you’re
sitting here just looking at it.

00:24:03.076 --> 00:24:09.875
You don’t have to go through the process
of finding out what is the process of it and

00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:13.766
then it moves the whole thing and gives you
the program and out of the program something

00:24:13.766 --> 00:24:15.096
comes out.

00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:20.896
It is there just at the same instant you know
what is it.

00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:24.886
This kind of a computer is made for us, why?

00:24:24.886 --> 00:24:32.896
To be wasted, to be confused, to be ended
up in a lunatic asylum?

00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:37.605
We must have the proper value system about
ourselves.

00:24:37.605 --> 00:24:43.975
First of all we are human beings made from
amoeba to this stage in thousands of years

00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:49.916
with great care and delicacy, for what purpose
we must ask the question, why are we made?

00:24:49.916 --> 00:24:55.865
Are we made here just to ruin ourselves or
not to do anything just like blind people

00:24:55.865 --> 00:24:58.965
going about hitting here hitting there.

00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:07.236
No, we are made to become the Spirit and the
whole system is built-in within you.

00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:13.095
And we have to go into another realm of our
awareness into a new dimension.

00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:16.526
Now these dimensions can be also misinterpreted.

00:25:16.526 --> 00:25:23.685
It’s such a dangerous line we are into because
these modern times are full of horrible people.

00:25:23.685 --> 00:25:29.476
Like somebody says that “All right, I can
hear voices."

00:25:29.476 --> 00:25:30.476
So what?

00:25:30.476 --> 00:25:31.866
"I can see light."

00:25:31.866 --> 00:25:33.616
So what?

00:25:33.616 --> 00:25:40.685
Or somebody says that, "All right, I feel
like I’m flying in the air, I leave my body."

00:25:40.685 --> 00:25:41.685
So what?

00:25:41.685 --> 00:25:44.366
What have you got?

00:25:44.366 --> 00:25:49.845
You are under the control of something else,
you don’t know anything.

00:25:49.845 --> 00:25:54.476
Logically you must know what you are doing,
what’s happening to you, what is within

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:57.026
you, you must know each and everything.

00:25:57.026 --> 00:26:04.835
You have to know that if I have become the
light then I must have the power of the light,

00:26:04.835 --> 00:26:06.216
I don’t see the light.

00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:09.656
If I see the light I’m not the light.

00:26:09.656 --> 00:26:15.126
If I become the light, then I have the power
of light.

00:26:15.126 --> 00:26:22.906
In the light you see clearly and that is what
you get is collective consciousness.

00:26:22.906 --> 00:26:29.726
You can feel another person’s Chakras, you
can feel your centers and if you know how

00:26:29.726 --> 00:26:35.326
to cure that, how to improve that and how
to raise the Kundalini which is a very, very

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:41.416
simple thing - because it is so fundamental
that’s why it is so simple.

00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:51.386
You can cure yourself, you can cure others
and you can live very joyously within yourself.

00:26:51.386 --> 00:26:58.886
This is what you have to have and that’s
how you will realize that we are part and

00:26:58.886 --> 00:27:01.926
parcel of the whole.

00:27:01.926 --> 00:27:05.955
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm.

00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:13.256
Not by talking about it by saying about it
by mental projections no, it happens to you,

00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:24.815
it really happens to you when you become the
spirit, it works on your central nervous system,

00:27:24.815 --> 00:27:30.065
you know what you are and what others are.

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:39.146
That they’re part and parcel of you is known
to you on your central nervous system.

00:27:39.146 --> 00:27:45.075
So we come to conclusion that if we have to
become the Spirit what should we do?

00:27:45.075 --> 00:27:46.075
Nothing.

00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:50.746
What do we do when we put the seed in the
Mother Earth?

00:27:50.746 --> 00:27:56.676
Nothing, but once you become that then you
have to look after it.

00:27:56.676 --> 00:28:02.896
When the seed is sprouted, comes out of the
Mother Earth then we have to look after it,

00:28:02.896 --> 00:28:08.276
and that’s the point where most of the western
people fail.

00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:14.276
The reason is this knowledge is not known
to them.

00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:19.016
Their knowledge is like the tree, which is
exposed outside.

00:28:19.016 --> 00:28:21.085
They don’t have the knowledge of the roots.

00:28:21.085 --> 00:28:26.486
This is the knowledge of the roots and we
have to give and take.

00:28:26.486 --> 00:28:33.276
We have to talk about it; we have to understand
that there’s nothing like India and England

00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:35.636
two different things.

00:28:35.636 --> 00:28:44.266
England I call it the heart of the universe,
it is, and India is the Kundalini of the universe.

00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:51.976
The Kundalini has to know England and England
has to know the Kundalini.

00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:59.845
If it is one whole body then one part has
to know another part.

00:28:59.845 --> 00:29:12.426
So all your misconceptions, or conceptions,
or maybe right ideas are all become absolutely

00:29:12.426 --> 00:29:19.705
evident, vividly seen because you get the
light of your own Spirit.

00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:21.136
That Spirit is missing.

00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:27.705
That Spirit which is all the time watching
you, witnessing you has to be enlightened

00:29:27.705 --> 00:29:32.976
in the sense that the Spirit must enlighten
your attention.

00:29:32.976 --> 00:29:39.835
That’s how you become the attention and
wherever you put the attention you act.

00:29:39.835 --> 00:29:47.206
It’s very surprising, like if you’re watching
the television, watching the television, it’s

00:29:47.206 --> 00:29:51.106
unreal and you’re looking at the television.

00:29:51.106 --> 00:29:56.965
They cannot act on you and you cannot act
on them because it is artificial.

00:29:56.965 --> 00:29:59.886
But supposing there’s a gentleman sitting.

00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:05.766
He’s a living body not artificial you are
talking to that person and that person is

00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:07.815
talking to you it acts.

00:30:07.815 --> 00:30:13.726
But this attention which is a subtler being
within you - your attention - supposing you

00:30:13.726 --> 00:30:20.356
project it to someone and it acts for the
benevolence, never for destruction but for

00:30:20.356 --> 00:30:21.396
the benevolence.

00:30:21.396 --> 00:30:27.085
When it acts for the benevolence you are amazed,
how does it happen?

00:30:27.085 --> 00:30:31.796
How can my attention have the power of benevolence?

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:37.316
Because in your attention is now the light
of the Spirit.

00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:40.835
So you become benevolent.

00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:47.986
You know the truth whether it is true or not.

00:30:47.986 --> 00:30:49.496
How will you know?

00:30:49.496 --> 00:30:56.126
I was once in Pune and you see in England
they say I’m preaching, I’m preaching

00:30:56.126 --> 00:30:59.146
about Hinduism, I’m converting everybody
to Hindus.

00:30:59.146 --> 00:31:04.335
And in India they say I’m converting them
to Christianity - because I’m doing both

00:31:04.335 --> 00:31:09.166
you see, [laughter from Shri Mataji and from
the audience] So they have a great objection

00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:14.455
about Me everywhere because they don’t see
the integrated work about Sahaja Yoga, all

00:31:14.455 --> 00:31:15.455
right?

00:31:15.455 --> 00:31:22.407
So they said that “This is wrong, whatever
She’s saying is not correct because we are

00:31:22.407 --> 00:31:26.685
Brahmins and we know about our shastras and
we are Brahmins.”

00:31:26.685 --> 00:31:28.286
But they didn’t tell Me all this.

00:31:28.286 --> 00:31:33.075
They talked all these things to others and
they said, “We can’t have Her in our hall,

00:31:33.075 --> 00:31:38.185
She’s not a Brahmin and She’s in a Christian
family we can’t have Her.”

00:31:38.185 --> 00:31:43.195
So the Brahmins, as usual all priests as they’re
always against the truth you see they were

00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:44.606
against the truth there also as Brahmins.

00:31:44.606 --> 00:31:51.526
I didn’t know all these things but suddenly
I felt and I said, "Whosoever are Brahmins

00:31:51.526 --> 00:31:53.546
among you please come forward."

00:31:53.546 --> 00:31:58.396
So four five you see very hefty people came
and sat in front like this.

00:31:58.396 --> 00:32:00.356
I said," Really are you Brahmins?"

00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:01.356
“Yes” they said.

00:32:01.356 --> 00:32:04.295
“All right, all put your hands towards Me,
like this.”

00:32:04.295 --> 00:32:09.085
They put their hands like this towards Me
and what happened that they start shaking

00:32:09.085 --> 00:32:10.085
like this.

00:32:10.085 --> 00:32:11.085
I said, “What’s happening?

00:32:11.085 --> 00:32:12.146
Stop it, why are shaking?

00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:14.796
He said to the others who are there they are
also shaking.

00:32:14.796 --> 00:32:17.906
I said yes but ask them from where they come.

00:32:17.906 --> 00:32:23.575
They said we are certified lunatics coming
from a lunatic asylum [audience laughs] because

00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:28.646
Mother has cured some lunatics so we are sitting
here.

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:32.816
Then they realized that they were also quite
lunatic [audience laughs again] because they’re

00:32:32.816 --> 00:32:33.816
fundamentalists.

00:32:33.816 --> 00:32:39.786
If you go to extremes you become lunatic,
I mean lunatics at least can be put in the

00:32:39.786 --> 00:32:44.146
lunatic asylum but these people are going
around everywhere, you don’t know how to

00:32:44.146 --> 00:32:49.906
control them, all over the world they are
creating such problems every, every country

00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:50.906
has them.

00:32:50.906 --> 00:32:55.506
Somewhere they are very sophisticated so you
can’t make them out somewhere they are very

00:32:55.506 --> 00:33:00.045
closed so you know they are there but some
are can be very subtle you can’t make them

00:33:00.045 --> 00:33:05.026
out but you cannot make them budge from whatever
they are holding onto.

00:33:05.026 --> 00:33:10.996
So this is how relatively first you realize
what is the Truth.

00:33:10.996 --> 00:33:17.705
With these vibrations, with the vibrations
that flow that you feel when the Kundalini

00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:24.136
crosses through your Brahmarandra as they
call it, we can call the fontanel bone area

00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:29.565
you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost coming out of your head.

00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:35.856
Then also you start feeling sometimes little
late in your fingers the cool breeze coming

00:33:35.856 --> 00:33:36.856
in.

00:33:36.856 --> 00:33:40.396
Now some people are very proud, "Oh, I’m
not feeling anything."

00:33:40.396 --> 00:33:45.116
That’s not a good thing; if you’re not
feeling there’s something wrong.

00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:47.226
Somewhere something missing, normally you
should.

00:33:47.226 --> 00:33:54.715
Children feel it very fast because they’re
so innocent, not yet spoiled by anything.

00:33:54.715 --> 00:33:59.536
They are not so egoistical; they do not have
these barriers.

00:33:59.536 --> 00:34:02.895
Some sort of problem is there that you’re
not feeling the cool breeze.

00:34:02.895 --> 00:34:08.476
You should because this is the All Pervading
Power of God which surrounds us, is everywhere

00:34:08.476 --> 00:34:12.306
and every one of you should feel that cool
breeze.

00:34:12.306 --> 00:34:19.066
Once you start feeling the cool breeze then
you become the joy because first of course

00:34:19.066 --> 00:34:20.246
you want to try with everything.

00:34:20.246 --> 00:34:21.276
"Is it cool breeze?

00:34:21.276 --> 00:34:22.305
Is it cool breeze?

00:34:22.305 --> 00:34:23.706
That is cool breeze.

00:34:23.706 --> 00:34:24.786
Should I go or not?

00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:28.026
Let me see now, if it is cool breeze I’ll
go otherwise."

00:34:28.026 --> 00:34:29.906
You go on like that.

00:34:29.906 --> 00:34:42.546
Then you realize this is the truth, this is
the truth, and then the joy of finding the

00:34:42.546 --> 00:34:43.546
truth emerges.

00:34:43.546 --> 00:34:47.046
But in India it’s just the other way round.

00:34:47.046 --> 00:34:49.636
They’re not bothered because they know what
happens.

00:34:49.636 --> 00:34:53.976
They know; they have the knowledge of the
roots, so they know what is to be found out.

00:34:53.976 --> 00:35:00.435
We don’t have to go very far, even, so near,
I mean, few years back we should say was,

00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:03.866
we had Nanaka, we had Kabira.

00:35:03.866 --> 00:35:10.856
They talked about it very clearly they told
about this so vividly that anybody with any

00:35:10.856 --> 00:35:12.805
sense should understand.

00:35:12.805 --> 00:35:21.425
Especially Kabira who was such a great poet
and such a great incarnation, I would say

00:35:21.425 --> 00:35:31.065
the way he talked right from all these Brahmins
to all the hypocrites and everything he gave

00:35:31.065 --> 00:35:34.556
them left and right.

00:35:34.556 --> 00:35:38.626
He was like Saint Michael with a sword in
his hand cutting everybody.

00:35:38.626 --> 00:35:43.425
Like your William Blake, he was really like
your William Blake who gave left and right

00:35:43.425 --> 00:35:45.825
to all these nonsensical people.

00:35:45.825 --> 00:35:50.526
He has talked about it, he very clearly describing
Sahaj.

00:35:50.526 --> 00:35:55.736
He said, Nanaka has said (???) you can only
get Samadhi through Sahaja.

00:35:55.736 --> 00:35:59.955
Sahaja means spontaneous, only spontaneously
can you get it.

00:35:59.955 --> 00:36:07.065
Then you have got Kabira who was treated like
a (shidule?) caste.

00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:10.465
Like a (shidule?) caste he was treated.

00:36:10.465 --> 00:36:12.165
Nobody respected him.

00:36:12.165 --> 00:36:17.945
Then we had Ramdas another one a great man
I’m told, there is a temple of this Ramdas.

00:36:17.945 --> 00:36:22.626
I was so amazed that in England it should
come and prosper.

00:36:22.626 --> 00:36:28.195
They were treated just like (shidule?) caste
by these people nobody would listen to them.

00:36:28.195 --> 00:36:33.386
Nobody would allow them to come in a temple,
these great saints, because they were not

00:36:33.386 --> 00:36:40.546
be a born in a Brahmin family; and these great
people have talked, Nanaka has talked very

00:36:40.546 --> 00:36:44.876
clearly, very recently they have talked about
these things.

00:36:44.876 --> 00:36:47.516
Hundred years back only.

00:36:47.516 --> 00:36:49.926
William Blake has talked about Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:49.926 --> 00:36:57.315
He has said, "The men of God, men of God"
- that’s you - "will become prophets and

00:36:57.315 --> 00:37:01.036
they will have powers to make others prophet."

00:37:01.036 --> 00:37:07.146
He had such hopes of making England into Jerusalem,
but where are those English?

00:37:07.146 --> 00:37:09.486
I have still to meet many.

00:37:09.486 --> 00:37:12.705
I’ve worked in this country for twelve years,
relentlessly.

00:37:12.705 --> 00:37:21.136
India I’ve worked very little but we have
thousand fold people who have got realization

00:37:21.136 --> 00:37:22.936
in India.

00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:29.866
They may be poor but they know what they have
to get, to them to get to their self realization

00:37:29.866 --> 00:37:32.075
is the thing.

00:37:32.075 --> 00:37:37.935
Nothing else matters, they do not intellectualize,
they know already this is it, this is it.

00:37:37.935 --> 00:37:47.156
Everyone knows, right from President downward
everyone knows what to expect, but whatever

00:37:47.156 --> 00:37:53.935
is our knowledge has been, we have to know
that this outside knowledge whatever we have

00:37:53.935 --> 00:37:57.356
has to have roots and we have to go to our
roots.

00:37:57.356 --> 00:38:01.666
We cannot live with this outside knowledge,
we have to know ourselves.

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:05.445
Everybody is talking about self-knowledge.

00:38:05.445 --> 00:38:13.056
There have been so many books, so many things,
I mean so much of seeking is on, that we cannot

00:38:13.056 --> 00:38:20.616
just avoid getting to our spirit, we have
to get to it but the only problem where I

00:38:20.616 --> 00:38:26.915
stumble down is that people do not have (?). They’re
very frivolously treating the whole thing,

00:38:26.915 --> 00:38:32.785
those who have got realization for them the
Kingdom of God is awaiting.

00:38:32.785 --> 00:38:38.856
They are not only welcome but they’ll be
cherished and that’s what has to be done.

00:38:38.856 --> 00:38:44.805
You have to cherish your Spirit, your Self
- you’ve not done it.

00:38:44.805 --> 00:38:50.126
Only just getting realization, feeling satisfied
about it itself is not sufficient.

00:38:50.126 --> 00:38:52.586
“Now I’m realized, all right, I’ve got
the cool breeze, I’m this.”

00:38:52.586 --> 00:38:53.825
No, you have to grow.

00:38:53.825 --> 00:39:00.666
It’s still a sapling that has to grow, for
that you don’t have to pay anything, nothing.

00:39:00.666 --> 00:39:06.805
Here these people, really I tell you, they
are working so hard because they have achieved

00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:09.945
a certain height in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:09.945 --> 00:39:11.266
They don’t take any money.

00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:16.686
They were just like you, they had to work
hard to first establish themselves, because

00:39:16.686 --> 00:39:21.705
that is the time where people want to say,
"No, Mother said Sahaj, so all right, we’ll

00:39:21.705 --> 00:39:23.095
sit at home."

00:39:23.095 --> 00:39:28.925
That is only for sprouting I said Sahaj, but
we have to look after because we have had

00:39:28.925 --> 00:39:35.496
conditionings, we have had problems, we have
had physical problems, we have had social

00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:39.496
problems, we have had psychological problems.

00:39:39.496 --> 00:39:46.585
They are to be attended to and the Kundalini
just goes and raise this energy there.

00:39:46.585 --> 00:39:54.665
Unless and until you know how to maneuver
it or work it out, it is very difficult for

00:39:54.665 --> 00:39:58.026
this Kundalini to manage by Herself.

00:39:58.026 --> 00:40:00.585
You have to show the will.

00:40:00.585 --> 00:40:03.325
If you do not have the will nobody can force
on you.

00:40:03.325 --> 00:40:05.516
The Divine is not going to fall at your feet.

00:40:05.516 --> 00:40:07.665
"All right, all right, get your realization."

00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:13.286
You have to knock at the door, and these doors
are only six - not many.

00:40:13.286 --> 00:40:19.516
Six doors which are partly opened out, again
closing, again opening out.

00:40:19.516 --> 00:40:25.565
You have to just know how to knock and how
to keep them open, finished.

00:40:25.565 --> 00:40:29.715
Then you become the light, and once you become
the light you give light to others.

00:40:29.715 --> 00:40:32.325
That’s how this world is going to be saved.

00:40:32.325 --> 00:40:36.335
No other way out, no other way out.

00:40:36.335 --> 00:40:39.715
We have to have transformation; we have to
become the Spirit.

00:40:39.715 --> 00:40:52.246
We have to be enlightened and to be the light
in the Great Being that is our Creator, our

00:40:52.246 --> 00:40:58.156
Preserver and the One who is our existence
itself.

00:40:58.156 --> 00:41:02.636
All these things are so simple.

00:41:02.636 --> 00:41:12.106
They may look bombastic when we see from outside,
but when you come inside it’s so simple,

00:41:12.106 --> 00:41:13.126
it’s very easy.

00:41:13.126 --> 00:41:17.616
Sahaj also has another meaning that’s “very
easy” - apart from it is spontaneous, it

00:41:17.616 --> 00:41:18.756
is very easy.

00:41:18.756 --> 00:41:21.055
We don’t want to do something easy.

00:41:21.055 --> 00:41:25.486
Like if we can eat our food like this we’ll
not, we’ll have to take our hand like this,

00:41:25.486 --> 00:41:29.506
and if you can eat in a difficult way then
it’s very good.

00:41:29.506 --> 00:41:30.876
That’s human nature.

00:41:30.876 --> 00:41:32.465
They want to do something like that.

00:41:32.465 --> 00:41:37.465
Like some people suggested to Me, "Mother
when You go to India and settle down there,

00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:41.405
then we’ll make these people that, ‘If
you have to get realization, you have to go

00:41:41.405 --> 00:41:42.405
to Mother.

00:41:42.405 --> 00:41:47.336
Then you must stay on a mountaintop where
there will be freezing cold.’

00:41:47.336 --> 00:41:51.756
Let them climb up seven miles and then they
will come to You and they’ll get their realization.

00:41:51.756 --> 00:41:57.066
Otherwise they will not because their ego
will not be satisfied with given things."

00:41:57.066 --> 00:41:59.365
What about Me?

00:41:59.365 --> 00:42:01.336
I don’t want to trouble you, why should
you?

00:42:01.336 --> 00:42:04.876
I’ve taken all the troubles; Christ has
taken all the troubles for you.

00:42:04.876 --> 00:42:10.395
Everybody has taken troubles, you better enjoy
now.

00:42:10.395 --> 00:42:15.165
You have to enjoy it; just you have to get
it.

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:18.276
There’s no end to My lectures.

00:42:18.276 --> 00:42:25.916
I’ve been lecturing and lecturing and lecturing
and I would say that this subject is so interesting

00:42:25.916 --> 00:42:30.776
that all here there are at least 60 percent
people who must have heard thousands of My

00:42:30.776 --> 00:42:31.776
lectures.

00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:35.176
Still they would like to hear more and more
[Shri Mataji laughs as She speaks] so I would

00:42:35.176 --> 00:42:40.696
suggest that we finish at this point, but
know that once you become the knowledge it’s

00:42:40.696 --> 00:42:43.576
easier to understand what we are saying.

00:42:43.576 --> 00:42:48.056
It’s very simple but only thing you have
to become the Spirit.

00:42:48.056 --> 00:42:50.566
May God Bless You.

00:42:50.566 --> 00:42:55.556
Now I would like to have some questions but
I’ve seen people when they ask questions

00:42:55.556 --> 00:43:00.246
they are representatives of some horrid gurus.

00:43:00.246 --> 00:43:04.395
Their horrid gurus pay them some money because
they take a lot of money then they pay them

00:43:04.395 --> 00:43:05.395
some money.

00:43:05.395 --> 00:43:07.666
Then they come here as identified with these
gurus.

00:43:07.666 --> 00:43:10.966
I have to request them what have you got out
of that guru?

00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:13.576
Why are you so much enamored by him?

00:43:13.576 --> 00:43:18.666
Why are you so much charmed by that, what
have you got?

00:43:18.666 --> 00:43:23.946
He’s using you.

00:43:23.946 --> 00:43:30.946
So please when you ask questions ask independently,
freely, I’ll be very happy to answer you

00:43:30.946 --> 00:43:36.426
but I don’t like that you are talking because
somebody has told you something.

00:43:36.426 --> 00:43:53.776
Whatever you know you ask me I’ll be very
happy to answer those questions to you.

00:43:53.776 --> 00:44:19.696
May God bless you.

00:44:19.696 --> 00:44:30.056
Question: You mentioned Christ, you mentioned
the Holy Ghost, you mentioned the Kundalini.

00:44:30.056 --> 00:44:35.076
If Christ is the Son, what is the Kundalini?

00:44:35.076 --> 00:44:37.796
Shri Mataji: She is the Mother.

00:44:37.796 --> 00:44:45.746
Christ within us is the Spirit and Kundalini
is the Holy Ghost, which is the Mother.

00:44:45.746 --> 00:44:55.095
The reflection of Holy Ghost within us is
the Kundalini and the reflection of Christ

00:44:55.095 --> 00:45:09.625
within us is the spirit.

00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:12.635
But everybody has played the role.

00:45:12.635 --> 00:45:24.126
Like Moses, like Abraham, like Socrates, like
Lao Tze, everybody has played the role to

00:45:24.126 --> 00:45:27.876
build up this drama they are all part and
parcel of one being.

00:45:27.876 --> 00:45:29.536
This one you must understand.

00:45:29.536 --> 00:45:34.716
When they said there is one God, he’s not
like rock of Gibraltar.

00:45:34.716 --> 00:45:42.026
Even rock of Gibraltar has got different molecules
you see but to ask God is one means, I don’t

00:45:42.026 --> 00:45:45.576
know, I can not think of such thing just a
one block.

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:56.176
He’s not, He has many aspects and these
aspects are expressed in these different ways.

00:45:56.176 --> 00:46:06.776
Of course He’s one, united, integrated,
one; but all these aspects are there, and

00:46:06.776 --> 00:46:13.625
this one God is either in the pockets of the
priests or the pockets of the Brahmins or

00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:20.626
the pockets of the mullahs or the pockets
of someone.

00:46:20.626 --> 00:46:30.336
One God.

00:46:30.336 --> 00:46:44.026
Question: Does the Kundalini have any relationship
to the Virgin Mary, the physical Mother of

00:46:44.026 --> 00:46:45.026
Jesus?

00:46:45.026 --> 00:46:46.026
Shri Mataji: It is, very much so.

00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:48.046
Yes you asked the same question.

00:46:48.046 --> 00:46:58.947
She is the Virgin the (kanya?) but gradually
when you come to Sahaja Yoga you will know

00:46:58.947 --> 00:47:06.066
the Virgin Mary, what is Her exposure is,
how many times She was born even in India,

00:47:06.066 --> 00:47:14.776
what is Her relationship and how great She
is.

00:47:14.776 --> 00:47:19.086
But why Martin Luther did not talk about Virgin
Mary?

00:47:19.086 --> 00:47:22.996
I asked My father who was a realized soul
and he gave a good explanation.

00:47:22.996 --> 00:47:28.566
He said it was (?) it means according to the
circumstances at the time, that time suddenly

00:47:28.566 --> 00:47:38.516
he found that he has to take the people in
a more enlightened field and he is doing so

00:47:38.516 --> 00:47:44.096
he wanted Muslims also to be included, and
if you suddenly talk about the Mother, they

00:47:44.096 --> 00:47:45.625
may not accept.

00:47:45.625 --> 00:47:57.096
So for that he avoided, but actually he knew
that one day somebody will explain.

00:47:57.096 --> 00:48:04.236
But human nature is such I must say that if
you accept one flower, you’ll not accept

00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:10.625
another, and when they’re dead - not when
they’re living, never, never.

00:48:10.625 --> 00:48:14.316
When they’re living we’ll never accept
it, we’ll never listen to them.

00:48:14.316 --> 00:48:21.306
But once they’re dead then wonderful because
he’s in our pocket, do what you like, it’s

00:48:21.306 --> 00:48:22.846
very common.

00:48:22.846 --> 00:48:29.856
We had one Gyaneshwara, a great saint in India,
very great saint and they have built huge

00:48:29.856 --> 00:48:34.266
big temple for him and he is in a statue.

00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:37.736
So when we went there they said, "You cannot
do meditation here."

00:48:37.736 --> 00:48:38.736
I said, "Why?

00:48:38.736 --> 00:48:39.916
What did he do?

00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:40.916
He did meditation."

00:48:40.916 --> 00:48:44.456
He said, "No, you have to do that kind of
a dance they do called (?)"

00:48:44.456 --> 00:48:47.306
I said, "But he did not do it.'

00:48:47.306 --> 00:48:49.286
He said, "So what?

00:48:49.286 --> 00:48:50.856
We do this way.

00:48:50.856 --> 00:48:53.146
He was another; he was great.

00:48:53.146 --> 00:48:55.736
We are not so we have to do this"

00:48:55.736 --> 00:48:59.616
So I didn’t know how to argue at with that,
so I said, "Look at the statue.

00:48:59.616 --> 00:49:04.976
Now you are in a statue, better come in a
form to tell all these people.”

00:49:04.976 --> 00:49:08.936
But when he came in form he didn’t even
have shoes to wear.

00:49:08.936 --> 00:49:12.296
He burnt his feet on charred grounds.

00:49:12.296 --> 00:49:15.216
Nobody gave him water to drink.

00:49:15.216 --> 00:49:16.216
All the saints suffered.

00:49:16.216 --> 00:49:17.216
Any other question please?

00:49:17.216 --> 00:49:18.216
Yes.

00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:24.345
Question: Do you need to believe in God to
get realization, like Buddha didn’t believe

00:49:24.345 --> 00:49:29.676
in God but still got realization.

00:49:29.676 --> 00:49:36.857
Shri Mataji: All right, Buddha did not believe
that’s not the point - He did believe but

00:49:36.857 --> 00:49:38.316
He didn’t say about God.

00:49:38.316 --> 00:50:03.966
I also didn’t say in the beginning about
God, because if you start talking about God

00:50:03.966 --> 00:50:05.566
it creates problems.

00:50:05.566 --> 00:50:10.946
That he said all these things because, why,
that’s what I’m trying to tell you.

00:50:10.946 --> 00:50:14.865
You see it is (?) the time, that time.

00:50:14.865 --> 00:50:22.286
What he thought that the people in India especially
were worshipping a God in a temple, the Brahmins,

00:50:22.286 --> 00:50:23.326
this, that.

00:50:23.326 --> 00:50:27.846
The Brahmins thought this is a God; they had
pocketed all the money and all those things.

00:50:27.846 --> 00:50:29.996
So how to bring them out of it?

00:50:29.996 --> 00:50:34.076
He said, “Don’t talk of God; don’t talk
of anything.

00:50:34.076 --> 00:50:35.206
Talk of the Self.

00:50:35.206 --> 00:50:36.786
First step is Self.”

00:50:36.786 --> 00:50:41.786
He said, “First they will have the Self,
then they will know where is the God.”

00:50:41.786 --> 00:50:47.256
Of course in the temple also we have some
things, which we can say are swayambus, which

00:50:47.256 --> 00:50:50.326
are, come out of Mother Earth.

00:50:50.326 --> 00:50:57.176
It is said in one of the commandments that
whatever is created by Mother Earth or by

00:50:57.176 --> 00:51:03.066
the heavens should not be reproduced, but
there is something created.

00:51:03.066 --> 00:51:13.946
So these temples were all completely monopolized
by Brahmins and these Brahmins tried to rule

00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:17.276
the whole country, that’s the thing happened.

00:51:17.276 --> 00:51:23.626
So Buddha thought, how to get these people
out and He talked about the Self only and

00:51:23.626 --> 00:51:24.626
nothing else.

00:51:24.626 --> 00:51:27.835
He said, “First Self”, and I also felt
the same way in the beginning.

00:51:27.835 --> 00:51:30.926
but now the time is different.

00:51:30.926 --> 00:51:37.416
Now I would say that it can go to any extent
this stupidity of these fundamentalists.

00:51:37.416 --> 00:51:45.066
Like in Nasik when Mahatma Gandhi returned
from England they said, “You have to go

00:51:45.066 --> 00:51:50.506
for (? Chitta)” - means a repentance – “You
have to go in for repentance because you put

00:51:50.506 --> 00:51:53.166
your foot on a foreign land.”

00:51:53.166 --> 00:51:54.166
Imagine!

00:51:54.166 --> 00:51:56.466
And they would not allow him to exist.

00:51:56.466 --> 00:52:00.716
They would not allow him to exist and he had
to do it.

00:52:00.716 --> 00:52:05.986
He said, “Now get rid of these mad people.”

00:52:05.986 --> 00:52:13.486
He had to do it and it was a Brahmin who killed
him ultimately.

00:52:13.486 --> 00:52:21.166
So I mean, it’s a very funny world, you
know and in that world we come and we tell

00:52:21.166 --> 00:52:30.086
about something that is truth - which is truth,
which is good, which is benevolent, which

00:52:30.086 --> 00:52:35.656
is the thing, but people just kill.

00:52:35.656 --> 00:52:39.566
I mean there is no need - at least if you
don’t want to hear, all right.

00:52:39.566 --> 00:52:43.076
Don’t kill them, but they kill.

00:52:43.076 --> 00:52:50.366
Even Mohammed Sahib was given poison, even
Buddha was tortured by the people, very much

00:52:50.366 --> 00:52:58.256
tortured in the beginning and His disciples
also went to extremes later on, not his own

00:52:58.256 --> 00:53:00.316
disciples but his followers.

00:53:00.316 --> 00:53:07.655
So now we have people who beat the seekers
on their back.

00:53:07.655 --> 00:53:11.296
We had one gentleman, his name was, he called
himself Omkar.

00:53:11.296 --> 00:53:19.556
He came from some Llama and he had a broken
spine and I had to work for days together

00:53:19.556 --> 00:53:22.885
to put his spine right, and they used a stick
to hit him.

00:53:22.885 --> 00:53:24.335
Can you imagine?

00:53:24.335 --> 00:53:26.546
Is it God?

00:53:26.546 --> 00:53:32.855
Is it religion?

00:53:32.855 --> 00:53:41.716
So Buddha and Mahavira, these two persons,
at that time did not talk of God, both of

00:53:41.716 --> 00:53:42.716
them.

00:53:42.716 --> 00:54:26.916
Later on they again incarnated and talked
of God as Hassan and Hussein, as Kabira.

00:54:26.916 --> 00:54:52.456
And the illusion was that every time He turned
His feet the carpet turned with Him.

00:54:52.456 --> 00:55:01.536
They’re all one; we are only fighting because
we don’t see the oneness.

00:55:01.536 --> 00:55:07.966
So because of the time they did speak but
they did not cut out, they had to say, “Stop

00:55:07.966 --> 00:55:10.946
at this point”, not more because that was
the situation.

00:55:10.946 --> 00:55:11.946
You can see that.

00:55:11.946 --> 00:55:12.946
All right?

00:55:12.946 --> 00:55:13.946
So it’s logical.

00:55:13.946 --> 00:55:19.375
Question: Do you have to do any practices
to raise the force?

00:55:19.375 --> 00:55:31.006
Shri Mataji: No, first of all I’d better
do it in a different way that you all get

00:55:31.006 --> 00:55:33.595
your realization, first of all.

00:55:33.595 --> 00:55:39.186
Then of course, as I said, your Kundalini
attends to your problems.

00:55:39.186 --> 00:55:45.496
She goes down, so then I have to tell you
how to raise it, how to bring it back, how

00:55:45.496 --> 00:55:46.516
to correct yourself.

00:55:46.516 --> 00:55:50.366
Once you’re established, you can do it to
others.

00:55:50.366 --> 00:55:53.356
So we can say it is in three parts.

00:55:53.356 --> 00:55:57.986
First is your establishment, like we can say
the sprouting of the seed.

00:55:57.986 --> 00:56:01.256
So that’s the awakening first of all or
realization as you touched.

00:56:01.256 --> 00:56:04.316
And then the second part you establish yourself.

00:56:04.316 --> 00:56:27.316
In the third part we establish others.

00:56:27.316 --> 00:56:36.296
All right?

00:56:36.296 --> 00:57:04.095
Question: (repeated by Sahaja Yogi) Are You
speaking of Kundalini awakening?

00:57:04.095 --> 00:57:08.686
Others talk about it and then deliver the
goods, is this what You’re saying?

00:57:08.686 --> 00:57:09.686
Yes.

00:57:09.686 --> 00:57:10.686
Shri Mataji: It’s true.

00:57:10.686 --> 00:57:11.686
That’s true.

00:57:11.686 --> 00:57:13.496
Easy to talk about anything.

00:57:13.496 --> 00:57:16.135
It’s true when one need not talk.

00:57:16.135 --> 00:57:19.655
There’s no need to talk, it works silently.

00:57:19.655 --> 00:57:22.246
It is working in all of you.

00:57:22.246 --> 00:57:28.226
That’s the right approach, who delivers
the good.

00:57:28.226 --> 00:57:32.325
That’s right, he said the right thing.

00:57:32.325 --> 00:57:35.835
Who delivers the good?

00:57:35.835 --> 00:57:44.956
We can be satisfied with artificial things
you know, we can, we can be.

00:57:44.956 --> 00:58:05.196
Be careful on that point, you said the right
thing.

00:58:05.196 --> 00:58:10.855
Correct.

00:58:10.855 --> 00:58:23.056
Question: As a realized soul how can one help
social problems such as problems in Ethiopia

00:58:23.056 --> 00:58:24.056
and so on?

00:58:24.056 --> 00:58:26.276
Shri Mataji: Well very much.

00:58:26.276 --> 00:58:32.895
Now Ethiopia’s problem comes from two angles,
two angles.

00:58:32.895 --> 00:58:37.036
First is Ethiopia you know that the Rastafarians.

00:58:37.036 --> 00:58:41.676
Have you heard about them?

00:58:41.676 --> 00:58:47.635
It comes from them; Rastafarians took to the
wrong side.

00:58:47.635 --> 00:58:52.096
In their religion itself you are supposed
to take the drugs and with taking drugs where

00:58:52.096 --> 00:58:53.096
will you go?

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:58.276
Into your collective subconscious, and what
is in your collective subconscious is so injurious

00:58:58.276 --> 00:59:00.966
that it can give you cancer.

00:59:00.966 --> 00:59:07.226
Cancer comes from the left side, which we
call as the collective subconscious.

00:59:07.226 --> 00:59:11.776
It can give all kinds of diseases, which cannot
be cured.

00:59:11.776 --> 00:59:16.256
Most of the incurable diseases come from there
and also the famine.

00:59:16.256 --> 00:59:19.885
The trees will burn.

00:59:19.885 --> 00:59:25.335
If you want to find out about a person if
it is true or not see the flower.

00:59:25.335 --> 00:59:31.686
Flower will just burn off, if there’s a
person who is possessed by the left side,

00:59:31.686 --> 00:59:33.716
it will just burn off.

00:59:33.716 --> 00:59:40.536
The cows will not give milk, all things will
happen in the nature, and when there are so

00:59:40.536 --> 00:59:47.686
many people who are doing this nonsensical
thing and having all the left sided movement

00:59:47.686 --> 00:59:53.405
of their attention, they catch onto these
and that’s how the whole thing works on

00:59:53.405 --> 00:59:54.706
their nature.

00:59:54.706 --> 00:59:57.905
That’s one thing.

00:59:57.905 --> 01:00:07.266
Now a realized soul if he goes to Ethiopia,
by his mere existence there, the nature may

01:00:07.266 --> 01:00:08.266
change.

01:00:08.266 --> 01:00:14.615
If he is of a very evolved soul it will, even
with attention he can.

01:00:14.615 --> 01:00:18.466
Now the second point is, what is gone wrong?

01:00:18.466 --> 01:00:26.085
You see this is what you say is the sin, the
sin, the wages of sin is fear, it’s much

01:00:26.085 --> 01:00:28.066
more than fear.

01:00:28.066 --> 01:00:35.186
It acts, this is a sin to go to these things
and succumb to collective subconscious.

01:00:35.186 --> 01:00:42.355
Instead of rising higher, keeping in the center,
going to the right and the left we can call

01:00:42.355 --> 01:00:46.276
it is the sin but in a very wider sense of
the word.

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:47.276
All right?

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:53.405
Now this is one thing that the country has
indulged too much into the left side will

01:00:53.405 --> 01:01:03.236
be grabbed, will be definitely grabbed into
the power of negative forces, no doubt about

01:01:03.236 --> 01:01:04.236
it.

01:01:04.236 --> 01:01:10.506
Their trees won’t grow, their flowers won’t
prosper, their children will die.

01:01:10.506 --> 01:01:14.866
They will have negative population, they will
have all problems of terrible diseases even

01:01:14.866 --> 01:01:15.866
AIDS comes.

01:01:15.866 --> 01:01:16.866
AIDS also comes from the same area.

01:01:16.866 --> 01:01:17.866
It’s a very serious thing and when collectively
people start doing it, you just entering into

01:01:17.866 --> 01:01:18.866
the satanic land where everything can work
out.

01:01:18.866 --> 01:01:22.916
That’s one thing, no use giving them money,
it’s very temporary.

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:32.575
Easy money is the worst thing; you have to
give them something solid, something permanent,

01:01:32.575 --> 01:01:37.306
something eternal, something living, which
will make them grow.

01:01:37.306 --> 01:01:40.096
That’s one point.

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:46.486
The second point of Ethiopia is a very collective
happening, which happened in Ethiopia.

01:01:46.486 --> 01:01:54.017
I met a minister by chance from Ethiopia who
was traveling with Me in the train and he

01:01:54.017 --> 01:02:00.556
told Me it was a political game.

01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:11.436
The politics which is not benevolent is no
politics at all, it’s a dirty game; and

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:18.395
when you go to the extremes you see the falsehood
is such a nonsense, such an ignorance, such

01:02:18.395 --> 01:02:24.296
a darkness that you start moving in it you
don’t know where you go till you reach your

01:02:24.296 --> 01:02:33.496
complete doom; and when you see that you don’t
understand what have we done, because to move

01:02:33.496 --> 01:02:40.866
on a slope is the easiest and that’s how
Ethiopia has landed in trouble.

01:02:40.866 --> 01:02:49.815
Third point which comes to Me very important
that applies to all the nations, whether they

01:02:49.815 --> 01:02:56.246
are developing or developed, that we don’t
realize that we are part and parcel of one

01:02:56.246 --> 01:02:58.096
world.

01:02:58.096 --> 01:03:02.716
God never created a separate world.

01:03:02.716 --> 01:03:04.396
It’s one world.

01:03:04.396 --> 01:03:08.615
Like one human being it has a heart, all right?

01:03:08.615 --> 01:03:14.885
It has a liver, it has everything but it’s
one and that we are all part and parcel of

01:03:14.885 --> 01:03:15.885
this.

01:03:15.885 --> 01:03:22.206
I would say that Roosevelt once said that
poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity

01:03:22.206 --> 01:03:28.835
everywhere, and when he said that I think
he understood the subtle thing.

01:03:28.835 --> 01:03:32.736
Anywhere in the body there is poverty, means
if there is any disease is a threat to the

01:03:32.736 --> 01:03:34.756
whole body.

01:03:34.756 --> 01:03:45.815
But for that we are not yet there, we are
not grown up, we are still so insular, so

01:03:45.815 --> 01:03:46.815
insular.

01:03:46.815 --> 01:03:53.405
Like the other day we had a lady who was English,
I must say, she came, and in My house I have

01:03:53.405 --> 01:03:59.416
- because my husband is international diplomat
traveling a lot - we have got things from

01:03:59.416 --> 01:04:06.936
everywhere and she only appreciated English
things, invariably even without knowing.

01:04:06.936 --> 01:04:16.346
She couldn’t appreciate anything even if
for sixth century, second century she wouldn’t.

01:04:16.346 --> 01:04:23.516
So insular, we are all insular, everywhere,
whether it’s Indian, whether it’s English

01:04:23.516 --> 01:04:27.986
whether it’s American, we are very insular
people, self-opinionated.

01:04:27.986 --> 01:04:31.186
We are not global.

01:04:31.186 --> 01:04:38.716
Unless and until we become global, problems
of the world cannot be solved.

01:04:38.716 --> 01:04:49.696
As if this finger of a leper is affected and
then there is no sensitivity in the whole

01:04:49.696 --> 01:04:50.696
body.

01:04:50.696 --> 01:04:56.496
Then what happens that if a rat comes and
takes away the finger the leper doesn’t

01:04:56.496 --> 01:04:57.496
know.

01:04:57.496 --> 01:05:02.446
So the lepers if you go to a leper home they’ll
say, “Just have the light for us to see”,

01:05:02.446 --> 01:05:09.605
but this light when it comes within you see
that we are part and parcel of the whole and

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:14.186
that’s how you grow up into the global personality.

01:05:14.186 --> 01:05:20.855
We are still English, British, Irish, Welsh.

01:05:20.855 --> 01:05:25.516
I was surprised even the Welsh won’t like
them to be called British.

01:05:25.516 --> 01:05:28.385
I mean it’s such a little land like that.

01:05:28.385 --> 01:05:35.256
Imagine in the heart if you have cells, which
do not call themselves cells of the heart,

01:05:35.256 --> 01:05:37.936
what will happen to that heart?

01:05:37.936 --> 01:05:39.496
It will collapse.

01:05:39.496 --> 01:05:46.196
It is happening everywhere, it’s not only
in one country it’s the same as I said in

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:48.706
every country we are very insular people.

01:05:48.706 --> 01:05:54.135
We have to expand and how do we expand, how
do we expand?

01:05:54.135 --> 01:05:55.966
Through our Spirit.

01:05:55.966 --> 01:06:01.266
As you can see the characters of these people
they were global they never talked about one

01:06:01.266 --> 01:06:06.375
country, two countries, three countries, they
talked for everyone.

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:17.075
This is the third big mistake, which all the
countries are doing and they are fighting,

01:06:17.075 --> 01:06:20.395
for what?

01:06:20.395 --> 01:06:23.616
Why are they all fighting, why are they having
wars?

01:06:23.616 --> 01:06:25.866
God did not create wars, did He?

01:06:25.866 --> 01:06:28.206
It’s not His mistake.

01:06:28.206 --> 01:06:35.536
This world belongs to Him and not to us.

01:06:35.536 --> 01:06:48.606
All theories they become self-destructive
how can that be called as a benevolent politics?

01:06:48.606 --> 01:07:05.246
In Sahaja Yoga we will have the politics of
Socrates, of giving and of not taking.

01:07:05.246 --> 01:07:12.395
But we have to have that race raised into
that personality that global personality.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.296
Can I do it alone?

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:27.946
You all have to help Me.

01:07:27.946 --> 01:07:44.626
Question: She’s no will power whatsoever,
She’s been a drug addict for 15 years, She

01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:45.885
just wonder she can….

01:07:45.885 --> 01:07:55.926
Shri Mataji: Don’t you worry, it’s all
there it will come back don’t you worry,

01:07:55.926 --> 01:07:57.335
all right?

01:07:57.335 --> 01:07:59.456
Don’t you worry.

01:07:59.456 --> 01:08:09.036
Love is the most powerful thing, we have never
used the power of love, don’t you worry.

01:08:09.036 --> 01:08:27.085
Question: I followed Swami Vivekananda for
years, advocated stern practices for years

01:08:27.085 --> 01:08:28.416
and years ….

01:08:28.416 --> 01:08:43.066
Shri Mataji: Now he is dead and gone, all
right [laughter…applause].

01:08:43.066 --> 01:08:47.746
I’m sitting here; I’m your Mother, all
right?

01:08:47.746 --> 01:08:54.385
I agree, I know, I know all that, all horrid
things forget it.

01:08:54.385 --> 01:08:58.326
I’m your Mother, all right?

01:08:58.326 --> 01:09:01.736
If I can work it out only with My love, why
should you worry about Vivekananda?

01:09:01.736 --> 01:09:06.575
It’s all right, forget it, that’s over.

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:08.226
You have done it in previous life.

01:09:08.226 --> 01:09:12.816
Vivekananda had to do it in this life but
you have done it before, all right?

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:15.746
You all have finished with it, now you just
get your prizes.

01:09:15.746 --> 01:09:23.456
[Shri Mataji and everyone laughs]You don’t
have

01:09:23.456 --> 01:09:25.615
to do anything like that.

01:09:25.615 --> 01:09:34.815
You see a person who has to cook who has never
cooked before has to go through all rigmarole.

01:09:34.815 --> 01:09:36.405
But supposing your Mother knows cooking.

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:37.635
She’s done the cooking.

01:09:37.635 --> 01:09:40.006
Come along and have the food, finished.

01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:42.036
Why to worry?

01:09:42.036 --> 01:09:44.216
All right?

01:09:44.216 --> 01:09:50.335
It’s already made.

01:09:50.335 --> 01:09:52.565
You are a seeker, you have been a seeker.

01:09:52.565 --> 01:09:58.655
You have done all that many lives, you’ve
been to Himalayas so now forget it, forget

01:09:58.655 --> 01:09:59.676
it.

01:09:59.676 --> 01:10:02.556
Better have it, all right?

01:10:02.556 --> 01:10:07.526
There are so many here I can see that kind.

01:10:07.526 --> 01:10:14.625
Question: Can we have the food that You’ve
prepared?

01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:16.956
Shri Mataji: You’re hungry, that’s great.

01:10:16.956 --> 01:10:18.916
Let’s have it, all right?

01:10:18.916 --> 01:10:19.916
Should we?

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:25.635
Now do not analyze anymore, just have it,
don’t analyze, when you’re hungry you

01:10:25.635 --> 01:10:30.585
don’t analyze from where did you get it,
what has happened, how (will) you cook it.

01:10:30.585 --> 01:10:31.766
You just see the fun, that’s all.

01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:34.726
You just enjoy it, that’s a good idea.

01:10:34.726 --> 01:10:51.256
Question: After you die, would you like to
go to heaven or do you wish to stay around?

01:10:51.256 --> 01:10:54.936
Shri Mataji: Who I?

01:10:54.936 --> 01:10:56.655
I die?

01:10:56.655 --> 01:10:59.746
I think of the present never of the future.

01:10:59.746 --> 01:11:06.027
You be in the present, don’t worry about
the future.

01:11:06.027 --> 01:11:11.506
We should worry about the present, that’s
why you see Buddha talked about the Self.

01:11:11.506 --> 01:11:13.555
Why talk of the future?

01:11:13.555 --> 01:11:16.105
Doesn’t exist for Me.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:19.926
Question: Present and future bind together

01:11:19.926 --> 01:11:26.466
Shri Mataji: Yes, Yes but you become first
the present, otherwise there’s no binding.

01:11:26.466 --> 01:11:31.476
Either you are in the future or in the past,
first of all become the present.

01:11:31.476 --> 01:11:36.026
There’s no binding, that’s the chain is
missing, that’s why I’m saying become

01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:37.026
the present.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.625
All right?

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:52.486
Question: I want to know the answer, are You
going to stay around or are You going to go

01:11:52.486 --> 01:11:54.355
to heaven when You die?

01:11:54.355 --> 01:12:12.856
Shri Mataji: I’m already in heaven (laughter…
applause) would you like to join Me?

01:12:12.856 --> 01:12:15.976
You please join Me in heaven, all right?

01:12:15.976 --> 01:12:18.216
I’m already in heaven.

01:12:18.216 --> 01:12:25.266
I see the heaven around Me everywhere, only
thing you have to enter into that subtle thing.

01:12:25.266 --> 01:12:30.365
It’s so beautiful; it’s so beautiful.

01:12:30.365 --> 01:12:46.596
All right, now you don’t have to do much,
but as I said we have problems within ourselves.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:53.456
We have to little bit work out ourselves,
our awakening and doing so you will know also

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.746
later on if the Kundalini falls off how to
raise it.

01:12:56.746 --> 01:12:59.226
It’s very simple, not much.

01:12:59.226 --> 01:13:06.516
You have to use your left and right hand because
as Mohamed Sahib has said that at the time

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:12.026
of resurrection your hands will speak, in
the sense that you get your collective consciousness

01:13:12.026 --> 01:13:15.135
and your fingertips become enlightened.

01:13:15.135 --> 01:13:20.716
So as all the doctors will also say that we
have a sympathetic nervous system acting on

01:13:20.716 --> 01:13:22.256
our fingertips.

01:13:22.256 --> 01:13:30.365
Now when you put the left hand towards Me,
it represents your desire to be self realized.

01:13:30.365 --> 01:13:35.315
So just you have to put your left hand like
this nothing else is to be done - simple,

01:13:35.315 --> 01:13:37.976
but in a humble way.

01:13:37.976 --> 01:13:44.696
If you say, “now give me realization”,
all right, but we have to be humble.

01:13:44.696 --> 01:13:45.986
That’s very important.

01:13:45.986 --> 01:13:51.956
When we are humble, we are peaceful and the
thing works out faster.

01:13:51.956 --> 01:13:54.836
So do not analyze it just get it.

01:13:54.836 --> 01:13:58.115
It’s simple how to eat the food I’m just
telling you.

01:13:58.115 --> 01:14:00.595
Put your left hand straight like this.

01:14:00.595 --> 01:14:05.956
First of all it’s better to take the advantage
of Mother Earth so you have to take out your

01:14:05.956 --> 01:14:06.956
shoes.

01:14:06.956 --> 01:14:09.546
You can keep your socks but better to take
out your shoes, because sometimes they can

01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:16.885
be very tight and your hats.

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:25.416
Anything tight, which makes you uncomfortable,
should be loosened, that’s all.

01:14:25.416 --> 01:14:30.596
Now, just put your left hand straight like
this.

01:14:30.596 --> 01:14:36.016
Everyone should try to do it, it’s very
simple, it’s not going to take much time,

01:14:36.016 --> 01:14:37.856
it’s very simple.

01:14:37.856 --> 01:14:44.556
Nothing is going to happen to you but, on
the contrary, you will become at least ten

01:14:44.556 --> 01:14:48.565
years younger, that’s a promise.

01:14:48.565 --> 01:14:53.446
You see a mother when she gives castor oil,
also she has to cover it with some chocolates.

01:14:53.446 --> 01:14:59.326
So now this is one of the temptations for
many people must be, but there are so many

01:14:59.326 --> 01:15:03.246
other things that I cannot describe in this
short lecture.

01:15:03.246 --> 01:15:07.486
So I would say that just put your left hand
because this is your own power within you,

01:15:07.486 --> 01:15:10.796
which you do not know, just put your left
hand just like this.

01:15:10.796 --> 01:15:16.115
All of you please put your left hand on your
lap very comfortably.

01:15:16.115 --> 01:15:21.256
Now your right hand is the one, which is the
power of action.

01:15:21.256 --> 01:15:31.305
With this you act, so you have to use your
right hand just first on your heart centre

01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:34.595
then because in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:15:34.595 --> 01:15:39.176
Then I’ll tell you one by one, but just
now can see on the upper part of the stomach,

01:15:39.176 --> 01:15:46.085
in the lower part of the stomach, then again
in the upper part of the stomach, then on

01:15:46.085 --> 01:15:52.676
the heart, then here, then here, then here.

01:15:52.676 --> 01:15:59.005
I will tell you one by one everywhere and
then on top of your head here, stretch your

01:15:59.005 --> 01:16:03.826
hand palm, put it down there and press it
hard, that’s all.

01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:04.826
It’s very simple.

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:10.375
Now this all has to be done with the right
hand, just remember this one point and left

01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:11.375
hand here.

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:13.005
What are these centers?

01:16:13.005 --> 01:16:14.886
I will tell you.

01:16:14.886 --> 01:16:16.866
One by one, you need not remember.

01:16:16.866 --> 01:16:22.516
It’s all in the book, but just now you know
that it is to be worked out on the left-hand

01:16:22.516 --> 01:16:23.516
side.

01:16:23.516 --> 01:16:30.005
Because left-hand side is our desire and we
are putting our hand of our desire.

01:16:30.005 --> 01:16:36.605
Now the left hand is already quite heavy I
must say, all right, so now.

01:16:36.605 --> 01:16:44.956
You put your left hand just like this and
at the very outset, as I’ve told in every

01:16:44.956 --> 01:16:51.916
Western program, you have to forgive yourself.

01:16:51.916 --> 01:17:03.556
You’re not to feel guilty for anything whatsoever
even for reading Vivekananda.

01:17:03.556 --> 01:17:08.686
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself;
after all you are the temple of God.

01:17:08.686 --> 01:17:17.246
So don’t despise yourself, don’t think
low of yourself, forgive yourself and say

01:17:17.246 --> 01:17:20.416
with full confidence that you’re not guilty.

01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:26.446
This is a fashion also, everybody wants to
say “I’m guilty.”

01:17:26.446 --> 01:17:28.796
It’s a fashion, it’s just a fashion.

01:17:28.796 --> 01:17:36.746
So please don’t consider yourself guilty
for anything you have done in the past what

01:17:36.746 --> 01:17:38.176
you think of the future.

01:17:38.176 --> 01:17:47.766
Let your present come up and then you will
know that all these were mythical ideas.

01:17:47.766 --> 01:17:49.916
The truth has to come.

01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:53.726
So now you have to close your eyes.

01:17:53.726 --> 01:17:55.425
Don’t open your eyes.

01:17:55.425 --> 01:17:59.766
There’s no mesmerism going on, so no need
to keep the eyes open.

01:17:59.766 --> 01:18:05.996
But in any case keep your eyes shut till I
tell you to open, because when the Kundalini

01:18:05.996 --> 01:18:08.396
is rising it’s better to keep your attention
inside.

01:18:08.396 --> 01:18:15.196
At least through the eyes the attention goes
out, so if you keep your eyes closed the Kundalini

01:18:15.196 --> 01:18:18.496
rises much better.

01:18:18.496 --> 01:18:23.626
Sometimes She does not rise if your attention
is out, so I know attention cannot be inside,

01:18:23.626 --> 01:18:29.606
but when you close your eyes at least it is
not going out too much.

01:18:29.606 --> 01:18:36.046
So the Kundalini rises and It sucks in all
your attention, like I can say in My sari

01:18:36.046 --> 01:18:41.275
if I have the Kundalini rising like that it
sucks in the sari like the attention, In the

01:18:41.275 --> 01:18:45.476
same way it goes up and ultimately pierces
through here.

01:18:45.476 --> 01:18:50.386
It should happen, you all should certify yourself,
nobody needs certify you.

01:18:50.386 --> 01:18:54.396
Once you say you are feeling the cool breeze
then you can ask somebody to see you.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:59.326
If you are not feeling it, don’t get desperate,
you all can feel it.

01:18:59.326 --> 01:19:05.136
There are so many here sitting and I’m sure
you can be told and helped.

01:19:05.136 --> 01:19:07.546
And then once you get it, you have to help
others.

01:19:07.546 --> 01:19:13.146
That’s how we are going to work it out.

01:19:13.146 --> 01:19:21.896
So now please put left hand like this, right
hand on your heart.

01:19:21.896 --> 01:19:28.666
Now here close your eyes.

01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:39.376
In the heart resides the Spirit, so please
ask Me three times a question in your heart,

01:19:39.376 --> 01:19:41.606
not loudly.

01:19:41.606 --> 01:19:46.136
Please ask Me sincerely a question.

01:19:46.136 --> 01:19:53.746
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can
call Me “Mother”, whatever you like.

01:19:53.746 --> 01:19:56.576
“Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:19:56.576 --> 01:19:59.396
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:19:59.396 --> 01:20:01.766
Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:20:01.766 --> 01:20:07.775
Now this is a fundamental question you’re
asking to a computer, which has to give you

01:20:07.775 --> 01:20:27.086
the answer.

01:20:27.086 --> 01:20:50.956
Now this question is followed by another question
when you put your right hand in the upper

01:20:50.956 --> 01:20:54.396
part of your stomach on the left-hand side.

01:20:54.396 --> 01:20:58.316
You’re working everything on the left-hand
side and press it hard.

01:20:58.316 --> 01:21:09.076
Now here is the centre, which gives you the
power of mastery over yourself, the mastery

01:21:09.076 --> 01:21:15.445
over the divine knowledge, the mastery over
the working of the divine knowledge.

01:21:15.445 --> 01:21:20.976
That means you become your own master, you
become your own guru, nobody can dominate

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:26.786
you, nothing can dominate you, no habits can
dominate you.

01:21:26.786 --> 01:21:33.816
So at this point you press your fingers dig
them down here you have to ask the second

01:21:33.816 --> 01:21:39.505
question to me, Mother am I my own master?

01:21:39.505 --> 01:21:46.996
Ask this questions three times please, with
full faith in yourself ask this question:

01:21:46.996 --> 01:21:48.925
“Mother, am I my own master?

01:21:48.925 --> 01:21:52.796
“ This will neutralize all your useless
feelings and everything.

01:21:52.796 --> 01:22:18.336
“Mother am I my own master?”

01:22:18.336 --> 01:22:27.255
Now please take your hand down in the lower
part of your abdomen and press it hard there

01:22:27.255 --> 01:22:31.396
on the left-hand side, keep the left hand
towards me.

01:22:31.396 --> 01:22:43.976
Now here is the centre, which is working out
the divine technique, the pure knowledge,

01:22:43.976 --> 01:22:51.215
the true art of this technique is worked out
through this centre here.

01:22:51.215 --> 01:23:03.146
At this centre I cannot force you in any way
that you should ask me for your self-realization.

01:23:03.146 --> 01:23:12.126
It should be your own desire free will ask
for it.

01:23:12.126 --> 01:23:26.116
So here you please ask Me, “Mother, may
I have the true knowledge?”

01:23:26.116 --> 01:23:31.056
This has to be said six times because there
are six petals to this center.

01:23:31.056 --> 01:23:42.856
“Mother, may I have the true knowledge,
the pure knowledge of the divine technique?”

01:23:42.856 --> 01:23:45.755
(Why don’t you do?

01:23:45.755 --> 01:23:51.556
You’re so young, please try, it’s very
easy.

01:23:51.556 --> 01:23:54.755
For young people to be that adamant is not
good.

01:23:54.755 --> 01:24:02.966
But please try, it’s worth it.)

01:24:02.966 --> 01:24:06.366
Six times please.

01:24:06.366 --> 01:24:57.046
You must learn to listen and sometimes understand,
all right?

01:24:57.046 --> 01:25:03.275
Now raise this hand again on the left-hand
side, on the same center of the principle

01:25:03.275 --> 01:25:12.456
of the mastery on the upper part of your abdomen
of your stomach, on the left-hand side, And

01:25:12.456 --> 01:25:15.735
now press it hard.

01:25:15.735 --> 01:25:26.436
This center has got ten petals, so here now
you have to help your Kundalini to rise by

01:25:26.436 --> 01:25:36.945
asserting the truth, by saying ten times with
full confidence in yourself, “Mother I am

01:25:36.945 --> 01:25:38.976
my master.

01:25:38.976 --> 01:25:42.706
Mother I am my own master.

01:25:42.706 --> 01:25:44.846
Mother I am my own master.”

01:25:44.846 --> 01:26:30.046
Please say it ten times.

01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:39.046
Now again you raise your hand on top of your
heart and put it there with full confidence

01:26:39.046 --> 01:26:46.826
here, as this centre has got twelve petals
you have to say with full confidence in yourself

01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:49.985
the truth, “Mother I am the Sprit.”

01:26:49.985 --> 01:26:56.476
You are the Spirit, so please say with full
confidence, “Mother I am the Spirit.”

01:26:56.476 --> 01:27:27.675
Believe Me, you are the Spirit.

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:48.175
Twelve times.

01:27:48.175 --> 01:27:57.255
You have to know that Divine is the ocean
of God’s love.

01:27:57.255 --> 01:28:04.846
It is the ocean of His forgiveness and you
cannot do anything that He cannot forgive.

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:10.586
He’s that powerful, His forgiveness is that
powerful, so there’s no need for you to

01:28:10.586 --> 01:28:23.715
feel guilty about anything whatsoever, by
that you’re challenging His power of forgiveness.

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:39.405
So now you raise your hand in the angle of
your neck and your shoulder and push it back

01:28:39.405 --> 01:28:42.316
towards the spinal chord and press it very
hard.

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:45.536
Now this is the most difficult center in the
West.

01:28:45.536 --> 01:28:50.755
As I said, when you feel guilty you catch
this center and you get all kinds of troubles

01:28:50.755 --> 01:28:59.436
like angina also troubles like spondylitis
and so many other problems.

01:28:59.436 --> 01:29:10.376
Now press it hard and with full confidence,
you say sixteen times, “Mother I’m not

01:29:10.376 --> 01:29:14.556
guilty.”

01:29:14.556 --> 01:29:16.026
Sixteen times.

01:29:16.026 --> 01:29:24.106
You have to be pleasant with yourself; you
have to cherish yourself and not to condemn

01:29:24.106 --> 01:29:27.896
yourself at all by any chance.

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:31.606
You are not guilty.

01:29:31.606 --> 01:29:34.996
So please say, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all” sixteen times.

01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:42.546
But those who still want to go ahead with
it punish themselves by saying it 108 times.

01:29:42.546 --> 01:29:43.546
That would be the best.

01:29:43.546 --> 01:29:48.836
(Shri Mataji blowing on her hand and rubbing
Her hands) So much heat coming out from there,

01:29:48.836 --> 01:29:50.766
so much of heat.

01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:58.646
“I’m not guilty.”

01:29:58.646 --> 01:30:03.106
Put your left hand towards Me, say with full
confidence.

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:10.606
Wow, this is the worst hurdle, I tell you.

01:30:10.606 --> 01:30:19.356
It’s just a myth; it’s a conception in
your head that you’re guilty.

01:30:19.356 --> 01:30:28.386
What guilt can you have that cannot be washed
by the great power of God’s love and forgiveness?

01:30:28.386 --> 01:30:39.726
(Shri Mataji is rubbing Her hands) Sixteen
times or 108 times.

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:42.706
You do not know how to love yourself.

01:30:42.706 --> 01:30:44.606
You’re supposed to be selfish but there’s
no selfishness I think.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:31:28.076
(Shri Mataji is blowing hard and rubbing Her
hands)

01:31:28.076 --> 01:31:40.152
Now raise this hand on your forehead across
and press it on both the sides.

01:31:43.434 --> 01:31:49.934
Now, here is the center where you have to
forgive others.

01:31:50.075 --> 01:31:57.695
I will not say how many times but from your
heart, please say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,

01:31:57.695 --> 01:32:01.854
I forgive everyone, I forgive everyone.”

01:32:01.854 --> 01:32:08.615
Now maybe you might say it’s very difficult,
but it’s not all because it is mythical.

01:32:08.615 --> 01:32:11.655
What do you do by not forgiving or forgiving?

01:32:11.655 --> 01:32:17.055
Is nothing, but when you don’t forgive you
play into the hands of wrong people.

01:32:17.055 --> 01:32:22.805
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,
everyone I forgive.”

01:32:22.805 --> 01:32:27.025
This is the greatest weapon Christ has given
us - to forgive.

01:32:27.025 --> 01:32:33.846
Forgive everyone, forgive everyone, forgive
everyone.

01:32:50.807 --> 01:32:54.255
Now for

01:32:54.255 --> 01:33:02.805
your own satisfaction you may put your hand
on the backside of your head, backside of

01:33:02.805 --> 01:33:04.265
your head.

01:33:04.265 --> 01:33:14.104
Here is the center where you have to say that
“If I have done anything wrong against the

01:33:14.104 --> 01:33:15.745
Divine, please forgive me.”

01:33:15.745 --> 01:33:24.035
You have to ask the Divine the forgiveness,
so that there’s no doubt in your mind or

01:33:24.035 --> 01:33:27.425
sort of lurking guilt.

01:33:27.425 --> 01:33:42.505
Say that three times of from your heart it
will work out, but don’t count the mistakes,

01:33:42.505 --> 01:33:44.585
so called.

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:46.695
Just say that, saying is sufficient.

01:33:46.695 --> 01:33:53.894
Saying is the enlightened chanting, all right?

01:33:53.894 --> 01:34:02.975
Now stretch your hand put it on top of your
head, bend you head a little bit forward.

01:34:02.975 --> 01:34:16.075
On top of your head, bend it and now rub it
hard the scalp seven times.

01:34:16.075 --> 01:34:22.405
Here again I cannot cross your freedom, so
you have to say, “Mother, I want my Realization.”

01:34:22.405 --> 01:34:25.894
I cannot force it on you, so just say, “I
want my Realization.”

01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:29.255
I can only persuade you, but I cannot force
it.

01:34:29.255 --> 01:34:30.885
You have to ask for it.

01:34:30.885 --> 01:34:36.905
So please say seven times, “Mother, please
may I have my realization?

01:34:36.905 --> 01:34:46.874
Please give me my Realization” seven times.

01:34:46.874 --> 01:35:10.255
(Shri Mataji blows seven times into the microphone)

01:35:10.255 --> 01:35:19.745
Now bring down your right hand, put it towards
Me.

01:35:19.745 --> 01:35:29.455
Slowly open your eyes and put your left hand
bending your head a little bit on top of your

01:35:29.455 --> 01:35:34.584
head here, little higher and see if there’s
a cool breeze coming out.

01:35:34.584 --> 01:35:39.795
With the left hand you see, not with the right,
right hand towards Me, the right hand towards

01:35:39.795 --> 01:35:46.024
Me, the left hand just try to see if you’re
feeling any cool breeze out of your head,

01:35:46.024 --> 01:35:47.865
all right?

01:35:47.865 --> 01:35:50.615
Don’t get upset.

01:35:50.615 --> 01:35:59.785
If you’re not feeling doesn’t matter,
we’ll work it out.

01:35:59.785 --> 01:36:01.624
Doesn’t matter.

01:36:01.624 --> 01:36:07.955
Now turn it round again put it here the right
hand, see with the right hand if you’re

01:36:07.955 --> 01:36:09.045
feeling the cool breeze.

01:36:09.045 --> 01:36:12.005
Some people don’t feel it, doesn’t matter.

01:36:12.005 --> 01:36:15.475
Nothing so desperately bad.

01:36:15.475 --> 01:36:27.544
There is, I can see that.

01:36:27.544 --> 01:36:47.235
Now left hand again, little higher, maybe
little higher, some people feel it very high

01:36:47.235 --> 01:36:53.334
you see, it shoots off, just see.

01:36:53.334 --> 01:36:59.235
Now you may put your hand up towards the sky
and ask the question, “Is this the All-Pervading

01:36:59.235 --> 01:37:01.195
Power of God’s love?

01:37:01.195 --> 01:37:04.604
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:37:04.604 --> 01:37:07.644
Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

01:37:07.644 --> 01:37:13.985
Ask the question three times.

01:37:13.985 --> 01:37:29.465
Now, such a lot, all the Sahaja Yogis sitting
here.

01:37:29.465 --> 01:37:31.455
Are you feeling?

01:37:31.455 --> 01:37:32.785
Cool breeze?

01:37:32.785 --> 01:37:34.115
Or what?

01:37:34.115 --> 01:37:35.115
Something happening?

01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:40.545
Now put back your hand, now don’t analyze
it just see in the hands are you feeling any

01:37:40.545 --> 01:37:43.644
cool breeze in the hands.

01:37:43.644 --> 01:37:55.385
All right, little bit, some feel a little
bit; but it’s all right, the beginning has

01:37:55.385 --> 01:37:56.845
started.

01:37:56.845 --> 01:38:03.995
Now most of you have got the right hands less,
so put the right hand towards Me, left hand

01:38:03.995 --> 01:38:07.225
like this towards the sky, it will ventilate.

01:38:07.225 --> 01:38:23.585
Left hand like this and now forgive, forgive
everyone, everyone you forgive, just forgive.

01:38:23.585 --> 01:38:26.455
That’s the mantra.

01:38:26.455 --> 01:38:30.995
It will release, left hand up.

01:38:30.995 --> 01:38:34.615
Right hand towards Me and left hand up.

01:38:34.615 --> 01:38:38.945
Now right hand towards Me.

01:38:38.945 --> 01:38:40.967
Moving, is it?

01:38:40.967 --> 01:38:52.035
Slowly, slowly it will move, right hand is
difficult because mostly we are very right-sided

01:38:52.035 --> 01:38:55.015
people, mostly.

01:38:55.015 --> 01:38:57.995
Yes, good.

01:38:57.995 --> 01:39:05.366
Now with the left hand you put towards Me
and right hand towards the Mother Earth like

01:39:05.366 --> 01:39:07.775
this.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:11.345
Left hand towards Me and right hand towards
the Mother earth.

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:17.785
This is what we are doing: we are correcting
the elements within us, bringing them into

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:18.975
balance.

01:39:18.975 --> 01:39:23.355
Which you will know very soon what it was,
what we were doing.

01:39:23.355 --> 01:39:24.604
You’ll know everything.

01:39:24.604 --> 01:39:31.065
No, no left towards Me, left towards Me and
right towards the Mother Earth.

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:33.215
Right towards the Mother Earth.

01:39:33.215 --> 01:39:36.385
Left towards Me, right towards the Mother
Earth.

01:39:36.385 --> 01:39:39.585
Mmm, better.

01:39:39.585 --> 01:39:42.785
All right?

01:39:42.785 --> 01:39:49.621
Now all those who have felt the cool breeze
in the head or in the hands raise your both

01:39:49.646 --> 01:39:50.781
the hands.

01:39:55.674 --> 01:39:57.903
All of you? Practically?

01:40:02.507 --> 01:40:04.132
The sprouting has started.
