1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:10,660
He was son of God and He came on this Earth
with a very great message that you are to

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,479
be resurrected.

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:24,070
It is not only that you have to maintain yourself,
and you don’t eat this and don’t do that

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:32,999
and all those Ten Commandments, but He came
to give us a message of our rebirth.

5
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:40,030
We are to be born again; not by any just a
ritual or some sort of a ceremony we go through,

6
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:49,370
but there has to be something living that
has to take place.

7
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,810
He has always talked about [the] living God.

8
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,940
So something living must happen and what happens
when it is something living?

9
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:05,299
When it is something living we start finding
the transformation taking place.

10
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,839
For example: you sow a seed and the living
process starts; the tree starts transforming

11
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:22,460
into the root and a shoot; and then the shoot
start transforming itself into leaves and

12
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,669
then into fruits.

13
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:34,210
It’s not static: not that we take one piece
from here and keep it there and it is transformed,

14
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:46,019
but there is something that happens within,
something very spontaneous which brings forth

15
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:52,509
this transformation and you see it with your
own eyes.

16
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,780
And this transformation has to take place
within you.

17
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:05,829
Now, in a case as I told you of Cathy or someone
like that one can say all right you must have

18
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,050
consoled or you give her love and this and
that she be consoled, but that’s not the

19
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,050
point.

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:21,260
As I told you there are many people who have
got everything, still they are unhappy.

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:28,360
And if you ask them they will say, “No,
we don’t know.

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,450
We are not happy.

23
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,450
We don’t feel happy.

24
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,590
There’s no joy in our lives.

25
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,660
We have lost our heart."

26
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,060
They can’t explain but it is there.

27
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,480
What have they lost?

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:53,640
The time has come for the whole world to know
their Spirit.

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,029
This is the time which is prophesised even
by William Blake where he describes England

30
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:02,370
is the Jerusalem.

31
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,870
The time has come for you to know your Spirit.

32
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,500
That has to happen.

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,740
It’s not a thing by which I tell you, you
stand on your heads or hold your nose or start

34
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,980
taking some names, like a one track mind going
on chanting some names like madcaps.

35
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:32,590
It’s not that, but something that must happen
within yourself and that must transform you.

36
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:41,110
Of course, one must understand [that] if it
is a living process, you cannot pay for it.

37
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,912
How can you pay for a seed to sprout?

38
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:51,060
The seed doesn’t understand; the living
process doesn’t understand money.

39
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,230
It’s the dead work of human beings.

40
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,240
How can you organise it also?

41
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
You cannot! It’s spontaneous.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
There is no technique.

43
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
It’s all built-in.

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,550
The technique is built: in the little seed
that you see, the whole technique of its growth

45
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,550
is built-in.

46
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,480
The technique is built-in and all its maps,
how it is going to be, what tree it is going

47
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:23,060
to be, how the tree is going to grow, in what
height, in what thickness, everything is inside

48
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,419
that seed.

49
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:34,250
In the same way it is a spontaneous thing,
which has to happen within you and if it is

50
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,429
so we have to find out.

51
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:41,750
That’s how the search started: people went
to India, went all over the places to find

52
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,750
out.

53
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,130
They thought we cannot find the solution here
let us go up there.

54
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:54,530
It has to be that way, because if you grow
too much outside you have to find out your

55
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,910
roots.

56
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:04,130
Because you develop that fear that you may
not be able to sustain this outward growth

57
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:13,290
unless and until you find out the depth or
the source on which this is to be sustained.

58
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,850
So people started searching and searching.

59
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:24,840
I have met many of them, many thousands, and
I find they were misled many a times.

60
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,949
They were really misled.

61
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:34,560
They were so anxious to get to it that whatever
somebody said they just accepted blindfolded.

62
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,000
People asked for money, all right take money.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,459
They starved themselves, collected money and
gave this to these swindlers and these cheats

64
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,679
and thugs.

65
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:57,269
How can anybody exchange money for the Spirit?

66
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,989
It’s absurd! It’s illogical.

67
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:08,870
But we understand money to such a great extent,
I was amazed, that we think that Spirit can

68
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:16,679
be bought by giving some money to someone,
or some sort of a material thing.

69
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:25,110
Logically all these things have to be understood.

70
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:34,259
Now to say that logically you cannot understand
God, is wrong.

71
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,010
You can, logically; not rationally but logically.

72
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,679
There’s a difference between the two.

73
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:43,525
For example, if you have not come to London,
you have not seen London, I have not been

74
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,980
to Newbury, I did not know it’s a beautiful
place like this, then I cannot understand

75
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
it.

76
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:58,039
But if I have come here, then I see with my
own eyes, “Yes it is so."

77
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,370
Then I have to say, “Yes I have seen it.

78
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,549
It’s so."

79
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:09,289
I have seen it, I have felt it.

80
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,160
I know it is so.

81
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,829
Then it becomes, the whole thing becomes logical.

82
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:17,359
But rationally if I sit in India somewhere
in the corner and think of Newbury, “Now

83
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:21,660
I am going to Newbury."

84
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:30,759
Just putting my wings of imagination outside:
will I come to Newbury?

85
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:40,889
But if I come, this is very important to understand,
if I come here, actually I come here, in person,

86
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:48,159
then I know the place and I know the people
of Newbury and I know it.

87
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,570
That means it has to be an actualisation.

88
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,129
If it is not an actualisation then whatever
you decide about it, this way or that, way

89
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,660
is absolutely illogical, because you have
not been there; very simple as that.

90
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,940
Some people say, “We believe in God."

91
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,549
Some people say, “We don’t believe in
God."

92
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:14,479
Both ways, whatever they are saying, they
are doing it I don’t know how.

93
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,440
If they believe in God, maybe it’s innately
built in us to believe in God.

94
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:29,940
But even they don’t believe in God, it’s
all right, because they don’t understand;

95
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,970
they have not been there.

96
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:46,670
But you must keep yourself open: open to understand
that if something has to happen to us, which

97
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:54,290
is a living process, some transformation has
to take place within us.

98
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:01,640
It has to be an actualisation, not a lecture
to you or a sermon to you, or some sort of

99
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,370
a service and then you disperse.

100
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:14,080
You must start feeling some transformation
coming within.

101
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,150
In the Bible itself, it is written: “I will
appear before you like tongues of flames."

102
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:28,940
Nobody can explain what it is like; they cannot.

103
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:41,590
It is written that: “The Tree of Life will
be fed by the water of life."

104
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,590
It’s a prophecy.

105
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,920
Now what is Tree of Life?

106
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,450
Where is it?

107
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,990
Where does it exist within us?

108
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,500
Nobody has tried to find out.

109
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,040
They say, “You must have faith."

110
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,170
“Yes, whatever is said is true.

111
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,170
You must have faith."

112
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:08,930
But if you have faith, after some time you
will be disillusioned.

113
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,620
That’s blind, absolutely blind.

114
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:19,450
Because where is that Tree of Life, you have
not seen, felt or it has not manifested.

115
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:28,360
For this we can refer to other scriptures
also, specially in India where people have

116
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,750
been more meditative.

117
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:39,770
As you have been more outward and seeking
[the] overpowering of matter, in India people

118
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,760
tried to find out what’s happening within.

119
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,760
I mean there are genuine people also, not
all are thugs.

120
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,460
They are not in the market.

121
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,600
They are hiding themselves somewhere in Himalayas
and all these places.

122
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:04,670
But in the sixth century only, we have the
description of The Tree of Life.

123
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,810
And the Tree of Life is shown here as you
see.

124
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:17,890
Now you are not to have blind faith in what
I am saying, there’s no need.

125
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,880
But you should not also deny me.

126
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:30,060
You should try to understand what I am saying
and see for yourself [if] it works out or

127
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,060
not.

128
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,680
If it does not work out we give another chance
to you.

129
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:45,930
Because you must know that I have come here
to give you something, not take anything from

130
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,930
you.

131
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,050
I cannot take, that’s my nature.

132
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,620
That’s how God has made me.

133
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,870
It’s something funny, but I cannot take
anything.

134
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:07,300
If I have come to give you then there’s
nothing selling, there’s no shop.

135
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:15,150
Try! If you should be open it would help you
better to understand what I am trying to tell

136
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,150
you.

137
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:27,200
Here now, you see the Tree of Life (chakra
chart) and when this Tree of Life is given

138
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,640
the water of life then what happens?

139
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,890
How the nourishment reaches?

140
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,370
And how it starts activating?

141
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,960
It is as simple as connecting this machine
to the mains.

142
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:53,060
Any machine, say a television is there, once
it is connected to the mains you can see the

143
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,700
manifestation of the machine very clearly.

144
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:02,010
And you are amazed [that] for a villager,
if you show, that he is surprised, and he

145
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,740
cannot understand how this is happening, how
are these pictures coming, from where these

146
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,770
music is coming, how these colours have been
shown.

147
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,960
He can’t understand it.

148
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:28,610
In the same way, once your machine becomes
connected, connected, with the Divine you

149
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:34,690
start finding Its manifestation.

150
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:45,460
Now in this picture we have shown you here
the subtle being that exists within us: just

151
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,150
like a structure of a seed you can say.

152
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:55,780
As in the seed there is a primule of the germinating
power.

153
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:12,130
In the same way, in that triangular bone is
the power which is going to give us rebirth.

154
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,920
This is your own.

155
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,940
This is your Mother who is going to give you
your rebirth.

156
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,220
She exists in all of us.

157
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,280
She is dormant, but She knows everything about
you.

158
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,060
She is like a tape recorder.

159
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,990
She knows all your past and She knows your
seeking and She knows you value.

160
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,500
She knows your defects and She knows what
mistakes you have committed, who has troubled

161
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,760
you and who has looted you, and who has deceived
you.

162
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,030
She knows everything.

163
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,730
But She is dormant.

164
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:57,390
She lies there in a dormant stage and She
is called as ‘Kundalini’ in the Sanskrit

165
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,390
language.

166
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:04,270
Kundalini is the word [which] comes from the
coiled.

167
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,570
The word ‘Kundalini’ means ‘the coil’.

168
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:15,300
And She is in three and a half coils, coiled
together, and just like, they call it like

169
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,050
a serpent, She is lying down there.

170
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:29,170
But you have seen mostly, most of the energies
are kept in a coil, because if any chord has

171
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,690
to be used we put it in a coil always.

172
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,510
The one end has to come out so it is kept
coiled up there.

173
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:44,200
Why this three and half is also a big mathematics
which, of course later on, you can find out

174
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,650
what is the meaning of this three and half
coils.

175
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:59,200
Just now, I will just give you a very, very
short description, an outline, about this

176
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,980
power that resides within us.

177
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,970
It resides in the triangular bone called as
sacrum.

178
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:13,760
That is at the back of us, our backbone, at
the lowest point.

179
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,370
You can see there is a triangular bone behind.

180
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,820
Now see this is called as sacrum.

181
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,930
Sacrum means ‘sacred bone’.

182
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:28,310
It has been found out that when the human
body burns this bone does not burn.

183
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,010
That is why they call it sacrum long time
back.

184
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,490
But the reason is the Kundalini is inside
that bone.

185
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:46,590
Now above that, you find there are six centres:
one, two, three, four, five and six.

186
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:51,150
And the lowest one is below that.

187
00:16:51,150 --> 00:17:01,190
All these centres are subtle centres which
manifest outside our plexuses, the physical

188
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,620
plexuses that we know of.

189
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:17,010
These centres exist as energy pockets and
they supply the two lines: you see the blue

190
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,860
and the yellow line.

191
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:31,270
They try to balance and arrange the power
to flow into these two channels.

192
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:41,650
These two channels represent within us, on
the left hand side, the one which comes as

193
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:54,110
the blue line which you see comes actually
from the right side on top and comes down

194
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,070
and meets the first centre there.

195
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:05,400
This is the line of Ida channel which controls
our emotional line.

196
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,590
It controls our past and is also called as
moon line.

197
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,900
It is, it represents our desiring power, our
desiring power.

198
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:30,670
The another line you see is the yellow line
which represents our power of action, through

199
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,010
which we act.

200
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,820
First we desire, we want to have something
and then we act.

201
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:48,040
So this line represents your physical and
mental being which goes in the front side

202
00:18:48,040 --> 00:19:01,560
and the left side of the brain and forms the
ego, which is a by-product of our activities

203
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,020
for our actions.

204
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:13,990
The first power of desire or the emotional
power, when it acts, for example say Cathy

205
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,750
was emotionally disturbed: her this power
was acting too much and was using all the

206
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:27,980
power from all the body and was creating a
superego there.

207
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:38,690
So actually on the left hand side and in the
front is the ego and on the right hand side

208
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:48,020
and the back is the superego, covering our
limbic area which is in the brain above this

209
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
centre.

210
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:56,370
This centre, Agnya, is the centre of Christ.

211
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,940
Christ resides there.

212
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,130
People say Christ is within us.

213
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,540
Where is He?

214
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,700
Which part?

215
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,280
Where is He placed?

216
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,140
He is placed in this centre.

217
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,890
Now when I say that He is placed in there,
we can prove it.

218
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,480
It can easily proved, because when the Kundalini
rises and if She stops at that centre — which

219
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,430
you can see and feel it, that it has stopped
there — you have to take the name of Christ

220
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,650
and request Him that, “Please allow the
Kundalini to pass."

221
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:34,100
If He is awakened, of course, that can only
be done by a person who is a realised-soul.

222
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:41,660
Any Dick, Tom, Harry cannot do it: you cannot
call Christ or anyone because what is the

223
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,790
right you have got?

224
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:49,560
There has to be a protocol, a connection by
which you can call Him.

225
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:58,130
Any such person when he calls Christ, He can
be awakened and the Kundalini rises from there:

226
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:04,990
that’s how you know this is the centre of
Christ.

227
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,260
What is the mantra of this centre?

228
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,500
Surprisingly, it is our, Lord’s prayer.

229
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,670
It’s the mantra.

230
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:20,950
It’s not only the Lord’s prayer, it’s
a mantra for this centre.

231
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,390
And the weapon of Christ is forgiveness.

232
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,760
When the Kundalini stops here, that means
you think too much.

233
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,490
Imagine all the Christians, or I can say the
Christian nations, think too much.

234
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,260
It’s surprising! We should not think at
all.

235
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,480
I mean Christ has done that for us.

236
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,700
We are not supposed to think.

237
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,290
But we think about everything, we plan about
everything.

238
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,050
We are mad with thinking.

239
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,860
I mean, it grows like a mad weed.

240
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,220
I was in Switzerland, there was a doctor who
came to see me and he said, “Mother, you

241
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:08,530
can cut my neck or you can break my teeth,
do what you like but stop my thinking!”

242
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,450
He just could not stop thinking.

243
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:19,580
What is the solution for this thinking in
Sahaja Yoga is you have to forgive.

244
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,060
You have to forgive.

245
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:26,710
If you forgive, then this centre can be resolved.

246
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:34,450
But forgiveness is just a myth, because what
are you doing?

247
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:41,910
If you are troubled by another person, if
you do not forgive that person, that person

248
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,910
is successful.

249
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:49,390
Because you go on worrying about it, crying
about it, weeping about it, and whatever he

250
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,760
wanted to trouble you for, you are just a
complete proof of it.

251
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,460
So forgiveness means what?

252
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,270
What you are doing is to get rid of his power
over you.

253
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:09,670
And this is what Christ has said that, “Forgive”
and the greatest thing He did on the cross

254
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,520
was to say that, “Forgive."

255
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,920
Because these people really committed the
real crime of crucifying the Son of God.

256
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,480
But still He said, “Forgive for they do
not know what they are doing”.

257
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,790
They do not know what they are doing, that
He was the Son of God.

258
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:37,470
It was impossible for people to believe Son
of God.

259
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,590
Imagine! Is He Son of God?

260
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,530
What makes Him that?

261
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,460
His resurrection proved it.

262
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,380
Till then nobody believed Him.

263
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,200
His disciples never believed Him.

264
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:05,960
He looked like a very ordinary person, carpenter’s
son, having hardly two robes to wear, living

265
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,310
in a very poor condition.

266
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:16,530
What made Him feel that He was the Son of
God?

267
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,819
His own knowledge about Himself.

268
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:28,760
Now supposing, somebody is the Son of God,
what should He do to prove it to human beings

269
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
are just like walls?

270
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,780
Sometimes I find I am talking to walls, absolutely,
or to some people are looking this side, that

271
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,770
side, and they are not understanding what
I am talking.

272
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:46,620
How are we to prove that He was the Son of
God?

273
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,689
It’s an impossibility.

274
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:56,120
And if He was born in modern times He would
have been crucified only when He was five

275
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,300
years of age I can tell you! Because now we
are so ego-oriented.

276
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,160
That time people were stupid but now we think
we are very intelligent: “We know everything!

277
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,440
We know God.

278
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,910
We can organise Him!” There are many who
say that, “We don’t believe in God.

279
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,090
We have created this world.

280
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,700
We are the scientists.

281
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,300
We are this."

282
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:29,450
Oh God! In this mad world, thank God He was
not born, otherwise He would have been crucified

283
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,470
much earlier.

284
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:47,600
So, was is impossible to convince at the time
that He was Son of God, but today we can prove

285
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,850
it! Because at that time human beings had
not reached that stage that they could be

286
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,850
given Realisation.

287
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,090
Today, Realisation is working en-masse.

288
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:08,720
Even in England we have now quite a lot of
people: “Even in England,” and I say.

289
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,110
England itself is really a great country.

290
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,630
It’s the heart of the universe.

291
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:20,800
It’s the greatest country, as far as the
articulation is concerned.

292
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:30,439
And the source of all that is good comes from
this country.

293
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:37,370
But the people, English people, have lost
their self-esteem completely I feel sometimes,

294
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:43,050
the way they copy French and Americans and
things like that.

295
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:51,450
If they could have their self-esteem, I still
say that the English youth are the best in

296
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,710
the whole world.

297
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:59,300
Surprisingly in my own experience I found
that they are the best.

298
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:06,730
But rather difficult nuts to be cracked! If
they are cracked they are the best.

299
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:12,850
And once they are there they sort it out because
they understand.

300
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,730
They are very scholarly.

301
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:23,310
I think by temperament that they understand
when I say, “You cannot pay money for that."

302
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,420
You cannot organise God, and something has
to happen within you.

303
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,630
Some actualisation has to take place.

304
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:36,780
This is what you should understand if you
are really an Englishman.

305
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:47,150
Because anything stupid and illogical should
be shunned completely.

306
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:52,679
Now what is the transformation takes place
[is] that, when this Kundalini rises, She

307
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,450
passes through these different centres which
are already exhausted within us.

308
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:12,450
For example the second centre that is within
us is the centre for our activity.

309
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:21,460
Supposing, you think too much, your brains
cells are to be replaced.

310
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:33,220
This poor little centre has to work very hard
to replace those cells in your brain.

311
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,710
It starts working a bit too hard and neglects
all other duties it has to do.

312
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:48,670
For example, it has to look after the liver,
the spleen, the pancreas, the kidneys and

313
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,400
the uterus.

314
00:28:52,400 --> 00:29:00,490
But when people indiscriminately just go on
thinking like mad — even thinking about

315
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,480
God — what is it?

316
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,770
It’s like, as I told you, not coming to
Newbury and just thinking about it.

317
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,350
It’s that mad.

318
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:25,790
Then this centre it gets so tired, and so
tired, it’s so exhausted that diseases like

319
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:38,000
diabetes, liver and other complications, even
[the] blood centre of this spleen can be so

320
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,810
crazy with this kind of activity that one
can develop blood cancer.

321
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:49,140
For example, now we are supposed to be running
a rat race.

322
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,470
I mean we are supposed to be.

323
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,620
We are in a race somehow.

324
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,400
Everybody is in a race.

325
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:01,580
Whether it is in the modern race or in any
other race: we have to belong to a cult or

326
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,850
some sort of a group where everybody is running
a race, you see.

327
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:15,130
In that racing we forget about the way we
eat our food, then we rush about.

328
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:25,270
We don’t even give rest to our different
organs as it is required to balance its activities,

329
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:37,850
[so] what happens that a thing like spleen
get so upset, it’s so upset, that it does

330
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,950
not know when to create more blood cells and
when not to create.

331
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,309
You are eating your food suddenly a telephone
call comes in, you have to get the telephone.

332
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:48,800
There’s a little child crying, you are looking
after the child.

333
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,429
Now you have to go to the office just leave
your food halfway or whatever you have eaten

334
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:55,819
and you just rush out.

335
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:59,950
You run to the bus and the bus is missing
so you run to another bus.

336
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:08,190
All this madness make this poor spleen really
mad because it does not understand what to

337
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:17,840
do, how to supply the new blood cells, and
the result is you develop blood cancer.

338
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,559
It’s a very simple reason why people develop
blood cancer.

339
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,660
And then blood cancer we say is curable through
Sahaja Yoga.

340
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,650
It is.

341
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:37,270
Actually cancer does not settle in to people
who are realised.

342
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,380
But it’s absolutely curable through Sahaj
Yoga.

343
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,411
All kinds of cancers can be cured through
Sahaj Yoga, no doubt, but we are not here

344
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:49,740
to cure people.

345
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:58,680
Only those who are seekers the Divine is interested
in.

346
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:07,830
You will be surprised, a very rich man, I
would say one of the wealthiest men from India,

347
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:16,340
brought somebody to be cured and I said, “I
am sorry Sir, I cannot cure this person."

348
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,260
And he said, “Why not?

349
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,510
If you cure I’ll build a hospital for you,
I can give an Ashram for you."

350
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:31,900
I said, “You may do whatever you like, but
I am sorry he cannot be cured."

351
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:37,420
I did not tell him the reason for that, but
the reason is this: this man has exploited

352
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,890
many people, he’s tortured his wife, he’s
tortured his children.

353
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,250
He’s a horrible fellow.

354
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:50,990
He has never sought anything good.

355
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,150
He has no compassion.

356
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,720
He has no love.

357
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,620
He’s for himself, a very selfish and a tyrannical
person.

358
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,710
Tomorrow if Hitler comes and say, “Mother,
you give me Realisation."

359
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,110
Do you think Divine is supposed to give him
Realisation, because he thinks no end of himself?

360
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:15,110
It is for the Divine to decide for you.

361
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,429
It is not for you to decide for the Divine.

362
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:22,569
The Divine has to say that you are all right.

363
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:25,990
It’s just the other way round.

364
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,460
Because you may do whatever you like.

365
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:37,870
You may think that you must get all the blessings
from God, but God has to know that whether

366
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,210
He is going to be gracious on you or not.

367
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,850
Even His anger is His graciousness.

368
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:51,420
Because that is what you deserve and through
His anger and wrath He is going to cure you

369
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,990
and improve you.

370
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,880
Sometimes we have wrong ideas also about our
seeking.

371
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:05,510
The seeking comes to us from the third centre
which is in the navel.

372
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,889
We call as ‘Nabhi Chakra’.

373
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,439
Is the navel point.

374
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:14,890
But it’s all in the spinal cord.

375
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:23,540
Now this third centre is the centre which
gives us seeking from the very beginning when

376
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,960
we were amoeba.

377
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:33,889
We started seeking food then, as we became
higher and higher and higher in our seeking

378
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:43,929
of food, we became human beings, then we started
seeking say, money, position, power, fame.

379
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:54,750
Then the spiritual seeking came: we started
seeking in religions outside us, organising

380
00:34:54,750 --> 00:35:02,869
religions, calling God, devotion, dedication,
but nothing worked out.

381
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:06,870
So we started a deeper seeking, meditating.

382
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:15,170
At this time also, people came down from all
over the world to teach you meditation.

383
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:24,320
Now meditation cannot be taught, it’s a
happening, when you are in meditation.

384
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:33,180
You cannot go to meditation: it’s not like
a small little house or a temple or a building

385
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,060
where you can enter into.

386
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,010
It’s a happening.

387
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,560
You are pushed into it.

388
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,050
You just become in meditation.

389
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:54,840
And this happening take place only when this
Kundalini pierces this fontanel bone area

390
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,119
and you get an actual baptism — actual,
not artificial.

391
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:10,869
You can see with your naked eyes, the pulsation
of this Kundalini, the rising of this Kundalini

392
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:19,109
and also the pulsation on the head here, till
it stops and you start feeling the cool breeze

393
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:22,140
coming simultaneously.

394
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:30,240
That should happen to you; otherwise don’t
believe in any tall stories.

395
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,530
For which you cannot pay.

396
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:40,560
For which you cannot think.

397
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,090
For which you cannot organise.

398
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,070
You cannot put in any effort.

399
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,310
It has to happen spontaneously.

400
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,050
So the question comes in: how?

401
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,460
How it happens?

402
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,070
It’s all in, in there.

403
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,180
It’s your own, within yourself.

404
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:14,280
But say there’s a light, say this is a candle
which has got a wick which has got a wax,

405
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,970
it’s just ready to be enlightened.

406
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,510
Then what you do?

407
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:27,500
You take one enlightened candle and bring
it nearer the other and you get the results,

408
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
finished.

409
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,290
What do you do?

410
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:41,380
The enlightened candle just acts as a catalytic
agent, and enlightens the another candle without

411
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,460
any effort, without any trouble.

412
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:51,690
In the same way an enlightened person can
enlighten another person.

413
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,140
It’s very simple.

414
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,730
But that person has to be enlightened.

415
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:11,140
And the enlightened person must know how to
maintain your enlightenment for the time being.

416
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:19,820
Like a seed you sprout: now the children may
sprout the seeds and they would not know what

417
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
do with it.

418
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:30,410
But a gardener knows: which sprouts the seed,
then it takes all the saplings separately,

419
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:40,950
looks after it, allows it to grow, then again
puts it in the soil properly, watches for

420
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,460
its growth till it comes to its maturity.

421
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,690
He looks after it.

422
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:53,230
In the same way the person who enlightened
should be able to guide you up to that point.

423
00:38:53,230 --> 00:39:01,490
Such a person is called as ‘guru’ in Sanskrit
language but he has to be a guru who should

424
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,490
be able to raise your Kundalini.

425
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:09,010
Because these days if you say the name of
‘guru’, horrible names and horrible faces

426
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,220
start coming before me and they are not gurus
they are just like satanic forces.

427
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,340
They are horrible people.

428
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:25,410
How can they be a guru, those who live on
your money: parasites of the worst type! You

429
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,460
should see that.

430
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,950
I mean, if I ask you come and live with me,
for no money at all, will you accept such

431
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,380
a situation?

432
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,400
And these are even worse.

433
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,970
And much worse than any dog, I would say.

434
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:49,180
Even the dog eats food at your house at least
looks after your house! This is only one way

435
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
traffic.

436
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:58,280
You have to go on giving them money, money,
money, money, becoming poorer and poorer and

437
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,810
what do you get?

438
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:05,620
Nothing! You must see their lifestyle, it’s
absurd.

439
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:14,480
They live on your money, they have all the
weaknesses that a scoundrel can have and after

440
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,530
few years you find they’ll land up in the
prison.

441
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,840
Already we have problems with the prison.

442
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,850
So don’t allow any of those gurus come down
here.

443
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,540
Where will you put them?

444
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:32,340
Like in Switzerland I went and saw one gentleman
there.

445
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,950
He told me that, “There’s a horrible guru
who lives here.

446
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,970
Mother please come and just pay attention
to his ashram."

447
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,420
I said, “All right."

448
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:46,970
I went with him in his car, and looked at
the place: a huge lavish place he has created

449
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:57,610
for himself, with very tall walls like a big
palace! And you could see from outside the

450
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,629
amount of money this fellow must have gathered.

451
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:12,350
And within eight days a nurse fell in love
with a policeman, and this nurse was the private

452
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:24,490
secretary of this guru who had used that nurse
to poison some oranges to kill some people.

453
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:32,420
And so the guru, the great, now is in jail
for 14 years.

454
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:41,420
All such horrid people what have they got
to do with Divine?

455
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:48,140
But they mesmerise, and once you are mesmerised
your seeking becomes absolutely stupid and

456
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,140
foolish.

457
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,050
You cannot see you are mesmerised.

458
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,480
You cannot understand how you are mesmerised.

459
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,050
You don’t want anything for yourself.

460
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:04,750
There’s another one who was coming here
the other day, and he said that, “If you

461
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,740
give me a Rolls Royce I’ll come."

462
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,109
Imagine! He was to come from America.

463
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:18,950
He had already got 58 Rolls Royce from you
people, from you, the English, very wise.

464
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:25,670
I must say the wisest people in the whole
world, have given 58 Rolls Royces to this

465
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:32,970
14 year old fellow! Now he has become yankee
in America, taken away all your money, befooling

466
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,970
you.

467
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,119
He has 58 Rolls Royces, he wants 59th.

468
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,940
I don’t know why he wants one more.

469
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,310
Poor boys and girls, they don’t have so
much money now.

470
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,369
Here the young people don’t have much money.

471
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:52,830
Like in our country maybe rich people’s
children get a lot of money, but here I find

472
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,280
that the young people have to find their own
way.

473
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,040
They starved themselves, ate only potatoes
and fasted, did all kinds of things to save

474
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:11,359
money to buy a Rolls Royce for this scoundrel,
just think of it! These are all seekers who

475
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,359
did it.

476
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:21,320
So foolish and stupid! And when he came they
presented him with this Rolls Royce.

477
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,740
My heart really weeps and I really don’t
know what to say to this kind of foolishness

478
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,740
people are doing.

479
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:35,530
Naturally your parents do not believe in you!
They think: what stupidity you are doing?

480
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,320
I can understand.

481
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,170
Even if they doubt me, I wouldn’t mind,
because really this kind of stupidity you

482
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,540
have done.

483
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,780
And how can you believe such stupid fellow
who asked for a Rolls Royce?

484
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:53,050
You should have really given him a toy Rolls
Royce and 3, 4 slaps on the face and he would

485
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,050
gone back.

486
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,870
That’s what he deserves.

487
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:01,700
Now he got this Rolls Royce very nicely, he
cheated you all and went back.

488
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:09,660
And he’ll come back next year and you will
be again doing the same thing for him!

489
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,550
Now when some of the Sahaja Yogis went and
asked these people that, “Why did you do

490
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,940
it?” They said, “He has given us something
so great.

491
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,230
This is metal.

492
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:26,580
If we give him the metal and if he gives us
the Spirit why not do it?” It’s foolishness!

493
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,441
Can you get Spirit for giving some metal?

494
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,441
Can you?

495
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:38,310
Spirit, can you purchase it or could exchange
it?

496
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:47,730
But
from where this kind of stupidity walks into

497
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,730
your heads?

498
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,270
I mean you are not such stupid people.

499
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,320
Most of them are educated in university: Oxford,
Cambridge.

500
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,330
Did you learn all these stupidity there?

501
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:01,650
No! It’s some sort of a mesmerism I feel.

502
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,950
Some stupid spirits have entered into their
minds.

503
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,630
That’s the only solution I can get.

504
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:16,140
I cannot understand what is the reason for
these people to go about buying Rolls Royces

505
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,860
for their gurus.

506
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:23,369
Then another guru comes up here and tells
you, “I will make you fly."

507
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:26,450
Very big, big people are out to fly.

508
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,620
But why do you want to fly?

509
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,840
Do you want to become birds?

510
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,090
Have you to become birds now?

511
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:43,740
You have to become a superior human being,
with superior value systems, built within

512
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,740
you.

513
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,140
You want to fly.

514
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,550
I mean it is stupidity.

515
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:54,440
Even if somebody gives you ideas like that,
better ask him to fly himself, drop him from

516
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,950
this leaning tower of Pisa and see where does
he lie, which part.

517
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,730
Why do you believe such stupid things, I can’t
understand.

518
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,390
You are supposed to be English.

519
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,390
I mean at least Indians have great ideas about
your brains.

520
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,390
H.

521
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,390
G.

522
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,850
Wells has said that English will have one
day having only heads and no bodies.

523
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:20,359
But I don’t think that’s going to happen
with the advent of all these stupid gurus

524
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:24,859
coming here and you people passing out all
your money to them.

525
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:26,480
I don’t know what is going to happen.

526
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,500
As it is we are suffering from so many other
things, plus this kind of a nonsense coming

527
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,590
all the spirits coming down.

528
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:40,770
All this negativity working into us I don’t
know what is going to happen to this country

529
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:41,770
of ours.

530
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:42,770
I don’t know.

531
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,030
I can’t understand.

532
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:49,910
Now everybody is meditating in this country,
trying to fly.

533
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:58,590
Imagine! Doing nothing, sitting at home, meditating:
lethargy of the worst type! Trying to fly.

534
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,470
This is what it is.

535
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:05,820
That’s what has happened to our seeking
in various ways, in this way or that way or

536
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,820
that way.

537
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,180
No, this is not to happen anymore, enough
of it.

538
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,550
You must get your Realisation.

539
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:13,700
That’s what you have to have.

540
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:21,210
The Kundalini has to rise and you have to
get it because you are seekers of ages, ancient

541
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,210
times.

542
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,020
You are born today, here, to get your Realisation.

543
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:31,260
That’s your right to have it, and not to
be befooled by these people who just come

544
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,140
here and exploit you and have floated a market
and enterprises.

545
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:41,340
Now this Kundalinis thing comes to you through
that centre.

546
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:50,890
When it comes to awakening centre, that centre
of your seeking.

547
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:58,820
Then you start seeing what you are seeking.

548
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:06,950
You are seeking the joy of your Spirit, the
bliss of peace within yourself.

549
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:19,890
When the Kundalini rises and shoots off, the
seeking is complete because you have found

550
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:25,570
it: you are just there, no questions.

551
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,610
Supposing you enlighten the light then what
does the light do?

552
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,160
First, she is asking for the light, all right,
“I must have the light.

553
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,170
I must have the light,” [then] she gives
light — finished.

554
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:43,700
Then you don’t sit there, you sit here with
me and you give vibrations to people, you

555
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,590
raise their Kundalinis, you awaken them and
give them Realisation.

556
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,760
Yes, it happens.

557
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,000
You all have those powers.

558
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,790
In a split of a second you get that and you
become that.

559
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:04,020
That’s your style [because] you are human
beings, you are not worms.

560
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:16,510
You are created out of the billions and billions
of creatures, special ones, the chosen ones,

561
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:25,190
to bestow this bliss upon you so that you
enter into the Kingdom of your Father, the

562
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:31,810
God Almighty, and enjoy your being and that’s
what you are.

563
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,440
Why are you wasting and frittering away your
energy on these nonsensical people?

564
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,049
Pay attention to yourself.

565
00:49:39,049 --> 00:49:40,540
Just find out what you are.

566
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,550
It’s a very easy thing: it should happen
to you.

567
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:51,080
It has happened to so many in this country
and should happen to people in Newbury.

568
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,589
It is Cathy who has brought me here.

569
00:49:54,589 --> 00:50:04,780
Actually now I am on my way to India and you
had this idea not to go out of London, because

570
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,980
I have really travelling too much in Europe.

571
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,379
Of course, I must say Europeans are also very
sensible people: they can see through now.

572
00:50:08,379 --> 00:50:14,430
But I think you have to go through all that
otherwise you would have never understood

573
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,750
the value of Sahaj Yoga.

574
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:23,240
Perhaps that was necessary for them to spend
a lot of money on these gurus and to suffer

575
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,430
from all kinds of diseases.

576
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:30,290
There are some here sitting, from there only
suffering from epilepsy and all kinds of horrible

577
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,290
diseases like blood cancer.

578
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,290
They are here, some of them sitting.

579
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:40,510
Then you will realise the value of Sahaja
Yoga which gives you bliss, joy and happiness.

580
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:45,800
First of all it gives you the physical well
being.

581
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,109
It just gives you the physical well being.

582
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:55,820
Like any place where God has to be brought
in, you clean that place.

583
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,150
So the Kundalini cleanses your physical being.

584
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,950
That’s how you get your diseases cured.

585
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:10,150
Cancer is very simple, extremely simple, to
be cured, very simple to be cured.

586
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:16,741
But for doctors it is impossible to accept
that there is God, in the real sense of the

587
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:17,741
word.

588
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,359
Ah, they will have a photograph of Christ
in the house.

589
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,080
They might wear a cross, you see, that’s
at the most.

590
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:34,680
But to believe that you can cure cancer through
Divine power is an impossibility for them.

591
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,230
But we have some doctors also here.

592
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,160
But if they come to me they think they are
all mad.

593
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,410
Cancer is a simple disease.

594
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:47,700
Now they have reached a point where they are
coming nearer to Sahaj Yoga.

595
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:56,530
On the left hand side and the right hand side
we have certain areas, and now they are talking

596
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:02,220
about these areas which exist within us and
they say there is an attack from these areas

597
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:13,040
which are built within us from the time of
our creation, and these areas have those deposits

598
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:21,600
and they send forth some protein matter, which
we cannot identify otherwise, which might

599
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,379
have gone out of circulation of evolution.

600
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:28,619
When they attack us cancer is triggered.

601
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:31,580
And now this I have said at least ten years
back.

602
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:37,410
I have been saying that there are entities
who enter into us.

603
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:44,180
’Us’ meaning the central path, the middle
path, the middle road.

604
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,520
They come from the sides and attack us.

605
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,170
But actually when we go to the extremes of
the left or to the right, we ourselves become

606
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:59,240
vulnerable and we are attacked and that’s
how cancer is set in.

607
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:06,609
So down below is the hell, the left side is
the collective subconscious, the right side

608
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:11,730
is the collective supraconscious, which is
the future side of it.

609
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:20,089
In the top is the Divine Power, which is the
superconsciousness we can call it, or the

610
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:26,869
collective unconscious as they call it, which
becomes conscious as soon as the Kundalini

611
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,160
touches it.

612
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,550
Your attention goes there and the whole thing
is lifted just like the tent being lifted

613
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:43,510
up, and you find that nothing can enter into
your attention anymore.

614
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,645
You are in that area where you cannot get
attacked.

615
00:53:45,645 --> 00:53:56,629
And this is what has happened to you, to many
of you, and is going to happen to the rest

616
00:53:56,629 --> 00:54:00,680
of the people who have come here for the first
time.

617
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:07,960
I must say, Newbury, I must find out about
it much more, because I find this place has

618
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,740
tremendous vibrations.

619
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:15,330
Only when our car arrived here I asked them,
“Where is the water somewhere here?” I

620
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,740
was not dousing but I can feel vibrations
of the water somewhere.

621
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,660
And the place has tremendous vibrations.

622
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:30,320
Actually I was thinking, “How am I going
to speak?” because as soon as I reached

623
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:36,290
this place my whole body started emitting
all kinds of energies from the body and I

624
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:40,960
was really very much worried as to, “What’s
going to happen now?

625
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:48,240
What am I going to speak?” But this has
worked out and I hope you have been able to

626
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,800
understand it.

627
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:57,270
Now for the rest of the details you just don’t
worry.

628
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:02,310
We have all the books and everything for your
information which you can read later on.

629
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:09,340
It’s is a simple thing, like coming in the
room, you ask me how to put on the lights.

630
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:14,790
I have to just tell you, “Just press the
switch and it will be on."

631
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:19,230
In the same way everything is built within
you, you don’t have to do anything about

632
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,230
it.

633
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,629
It will work out in no time.

634
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:28,510
But once it is worked out then you [should]
try to understand it, what it is, and try

635
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,829
to maintain it for a while.

636
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:38,720
And you will be amazed that, here in Newbury,
you can start a centre of your own of Sahaj

637
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,830
Yoga, giving Realisation to many people.

638
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,940
May God bless you! Thank you.

639
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:51,650
If you have any questions you can ask me.

640
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:54,550
Yes, please.

641
00:55:54,550 --> 00:56:03,250
Man: Yeah I have got a question okay.

642
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:07,110
Earlier on you were going on about if you
have family, children, and such as, who interrupt

643
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,480
you and the telephone.

644
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,329
What were you trying to say?

645
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:13,869
Do you want us just ignore this?

646
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:17,150
Shri Mataji: Oh, not at all! If you are not
married you cannot get Realisation.

647
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,910
Man: Then what do you mean by this?

648
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:24,879
I tend to think you are you trying to say
that you must try and ignore household attractions

649
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:25,879
and this…

650
00:56:25,879 --> 00:56:29,760
Shri Mataji: When did I say that?

651
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,330
Man: I don’t quite know.

652
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:38,790
I had a job to hear everything you say but…

653
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:43,490
Shri Mataji: No, no, no! Who said that?

654
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,250
Not at all!

655
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:51,690
Man: What did you mean when you say, “The
telephone rings.."

656
00:56:51,690 --> 00:57:01,310
What do you mean, “You must suddenly stop
and answer the telephone,” but what do you

657
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,310
mean?

658
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,970
Yogini: Mother, it’s when you were talking
about the spleen.

659
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,210
You said that the trouble is that there are
so many distractions that the spleen can’t

660
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,450
handle it, and I think he’s misunderstood
you.

661
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,450
Man: Yeah, that’s right.

662
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:13,900
Shri Mataji: Ah! No, no, no, you should only
look after your child and not the telephone,

663
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,900
I was meaning.

664
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,900
You must have your priorities properly built
up.

665
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,900
Ours are not.

666
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,780
What I was trying to say a child is lying
there, you are eating your food, a telephone

667
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:25,810
is coming, now you have to rush out, the child
is neglected, you run away, you are worried

668
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,160
about the child — never that [what you were
suggesting].

669
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,390
You don’t know in Sahaja Yoga you have to
be married.

670
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,270
There’s a centre of marriage.

671
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,660
You will be amazed.

672
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,680
If you are a so called ascetic, I can’t
give you Realisation.

673
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,560
Another man: You can’t what?

674
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:44,109
Shri Mataji: You can’t get your Realisation
if you are an ascetic.

675
00:57:44,109 --> 00:57:45,410
So called.

676
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,440
Asceticism is within yourself.

677
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,129
A person like Guru Nanaka and all these great
people they were all married people.

678
00:57:53,129 --> 00:57:56,650
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up
your family at all.

679
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:02,430
On the contrary, we have to have families,
beautiful families and beautiful children

680
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:04,530
and we are having Sahaja Yoga marriages.

681
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:09,410
Do you know there are three or four couples
here who were married through Sahaj Yoga.

682
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,530
And they are beautiful people, they have beautiful
children.

683
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:19,940
And moreover I must tell you a greater news:
that there are lots of realised-souls who

684
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,530
are born in this country.

685
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:26,020
And you have to be married so that they are
born to you also.

686
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:31,310
Now this child is a realised-soul, she is
sitting, towards me.

687
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:37,400
To be sitting that quietly is not possible
unless and until they are realised.

688
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,400
This Alison is born-realised.

689
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,970
Man: My children, my three children: They
are not realised and they are sitting here

690
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:40,970
all quiet!

691
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:41,970
Shri Mataji: Who?

692
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:43,129
Man: My children, my 3 children, they are
not realised so you are taking…

693
00:58:43,129 --> 00:58:44,129
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

694
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:45,129
Let me see where are they?

695
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:46,129
Man: One, two, three.

696
00:58:46,129 --> 00:58:47,240
Shri Mataji: They must be born-realised, I
am sure.

697
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,240
Man: They are not! They are not!

698
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,540
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

699
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,250
How do you know?

700
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,290
We’ll tell them.

701
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:58,020
How do you know?

702
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:05,540
You don’t know, you are not yet realised
but they are, must be I am sure, 100%.

703
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:10,849
Man: Well it seems that anything you say,
goes.

704
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:12,320
Shri Mataji: We’ll teach you how to know.

705
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
We’ll teach you how to know.

706
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
You should get your Realisation.

707
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Where are they?

708
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
I would love to see them.

709
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
I can’t see them.

710
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,510
Man: But they are quiet all the time.

711
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:19,750
I say it’s instinct.

712
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,940
Shri Mataji: Come along, come, come.

713
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,020
They must be born-realised to be quiet like
that.

714
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,020
I would like to see them.

715
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,020
I am sure.

716
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,020
How would you know their value?

717
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,180
I would love to see them.

718
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,210
Oh that, she is realised 100%.

719
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:38,000
Are you doubting her Realisation?

720
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,629
She is born-realised.

721
00:59:40,629 --> 00:59:41,879
She is born as a realised-soul.

722
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,740
She is born-realised, no doubt.

723
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,830
I mean I knew, I was going to ask about her.

724
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,320
How do you know?

725
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,910
You are a great person to have three children
born-realised, I must say.

726
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:57,040
For example, the little one there is a born-realised
and the little in that corner is a born-realised.

727
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,510
And there are many born-realised people, also
there are people who are there.

728
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,930
Where is Alan is he there?

729
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,950
Man: It’s just natural it doesn’t need
a big word for it, does it!

730
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:08,830
Shri Mataji: They are born-realised because
they got their Realisation in their previous

731
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:09,830
lives.

732
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,610
It is a very big thing for people who are
not realised.

733
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,190
Man: What do they know about previous lives?

734
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,440
They don’t know anything about previous
lives.

735
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,820
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am going to tell
them.

736
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,590
That’s why I am here.

737
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,060
They are born because I am here.

738
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,480
Do you know that?

739
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,410
I am going to tell them what it is.

740
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:32,090
See these, these are all born-realised [those]
two people [who] are coming.

741
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,430
Ask them about it.

742
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:38,670
I never gave them Realisation they are born-realised
but I gave them the knowledge about what they

743
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:39,670
are.

744
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,800
(Sit down my child, sit down.) They are all
realised-souls, no doubt about it! Not [just]

745
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:50,329
realised-souls but they could be very great
souls born on this Earth.

746
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,250
It is not [that] they are quiet because they
are told to be.

747
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:57,250
If they were not realised-souls they would
have run away.

748
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,800
They would not have been sitting because they
are enjoying it.

749
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,129
Their Spirit is enjoying it.

750
01:01:03,129 --> 01:01:04,520
You will know it very soon.

751
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,010
Man: They will sit quietly anywhere!

752
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,080
Shri Mataji: No, no, they might because they
are realised-souls.

753
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,090
Man: No, it doesn’t mean they are realised-souls,
it just means they are children.

754
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:17,110
Shri Mataji: They are very different types
of children, very different type, something

755
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,110
so unique.

756
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,880
Once you get your Realisation you will start
seeing their beauty much better.

757
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,340
Oh! They know such a lot you can’t imagine.

758
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,640
My four grandchildren are born-realised but
my own daughters were not.

759
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,810
What am I to do?

760
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:37,300
And four of them are great people, but my
own daughters were not.

761
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,540
What to do?

762
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,980
They are born-realised.

763
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,370
You will see that.

764
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,370
They are that.

765
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,060
You should be a proud man.

766
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,130
But you better get your Realisation, all right.

767
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:55,040
I am happy you are so concerned about your
children.

768
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,340
I am very happy.

769
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,640
May God bless you.

770
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,640
Any other questions?

771
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:05,170
Seeker: I am very impressed with what you
said about Christ having done thinking for

772
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:10,970
us and we ourselves are trying to think too
much.

773
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:26,770
Isn’t there a danger, if we all become child-like
trusters, that we could be exploited?

774
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:31,400
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is a danger, of course.

775
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,950
I mean you are already exploited 100%.

776
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,570
There is a danger, no doubt.

777
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,480
I have already told you about the danger.

778
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,599
But to become child-like is not easy.

779
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:45,119
You can be befooled but to be child-like is
the best thing.

780
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,110
Innocence is the most powerful thing.

781
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:53,520
If you are innocent nobody can touch you.

782
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,510
But very difficult to be innocent.

783
01:02:56,510 --> 01:03:02,700
The centre of innocence has to be awakened
within us, then you will be like children.

784
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:10,379
Now would you say that Christ was exploited,
many people feel that way that He was exploited:

785
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:13,310
no! It was all planned very well.

786
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,900
He just played a drama.

787
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,420
Such people do not suffer.

788
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,810
I do not suffer, never.

789
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:22,990
Even if I say that I am suffering it’s just
a joke.

790
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,070
Never take that seriously.

791
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,900
It’s a drama.

792
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,339
Such people don’t suffer.

793
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:33,930
He never suffered, in the sense you understand
suffering.

794
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:38,329
Of course, with the physical body you do feel
little pain here and there.

795
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:46,129
But you just see it as a witness.

796
01:03:46,129 --> 01:03:48,250
You are not really in it.

797
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:54,359
And when you become that, yourself, a witness,
nobody can exploit you.

798
01:03:54,359 --> 01:04:01,040
Because what happens you develop a new type
of a dimension, an awareness, which is called

799
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
as vibratory awareness.

800
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,830
By this enlightenment of your fingers you
become collectively conscious.

801
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:13,879
Immediately you know who is who, what is what.

802
01:04:13,879 --> 01:04:16,710
Children know it, those who are realised-souls
specially know it.

803
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:19,910
Any funny man comes in they start crying and
weeping.

804
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,440
Like this girl’s father and mother were
involved in a nonsense.

805
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,750
They are here now.

806
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:31,520
Both suffered a lot the mother became epileptic
and all that.

807
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:39,129
And this child used to scream whenever she
saw their revered guru, and she used to shout

808
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:43,140
and resist and she used to kick him.

809
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,580
She is just a child but she knew how to protect.

810
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:53,080
And these people with all their intelligence
and education and this and that, were absolutely

811
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:58,230
useless! Because you develop that new awareness
within you by which you can feel a person,

812
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,230
you know.

813
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,230
You cannot be exploited.

814
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,230
All right.

815
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:08,510
That has to happen to you.

816
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,210
That’s a happening.

817
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:16,710
Such a powerful personality develops, such
a powerful personality.

818
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:23,200
That way, many of our Sahaj Yogis also think
that I am a quite an innocent person, I mean

819
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,200
they think so, but now they know I know everything.

820
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:32,349
I may look such a fool, but I am not.

821
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:41,130
And the powerfulness is such, that first the
compassion, the compassion itself is so powerful,

822
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,580
so engulfing, it’s so rewarding.

823
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,720
Then you are not bothered about anyone.

824
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:49,400
What are they going to do to you?

825
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:55,410
Like in India when I started, right and left
criticising, all these gurus, taking their

826
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,410
names.

827
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,510
I started saying, “Now these people are
like this.

828
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,800
These people, they are making money and befooling
you."

829
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:08,629
Some of the guru’s people, who were [become]
Sahaja Yogis, one of them was some Raja or

830
01:06:08,629 --> 01:06:12,619
some place, he came to me and said, “Mother,
what are you doing?

831
01:06:12,619 --> 01:06:13,619
They will kill You."

832
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:18,700
I said, “This time let them try killing
me! Who is going to kill me, I’ll see?

833
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,210
That was done once for all.

834
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:24,730
Now let me see who is going to kill me."

835
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:29,330
I said, “Let them lift their hands towards
me, if they can they’ll shake.

836
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,000
They cannot kill me."

837
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:38,790
It’s the most powerful thing is your innocence
which we have lost sometimes foolishly.

838
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,074
It is the highest thing.

839
01:06:44,074 --> 01:06:49,784
And nobody can exploit an innocent person,
nobody can befool.

840
01:06:49,784 --> 01:06:55,324
You have seen simple village folk, how do
they exist with all the cunning of the very

841
01:06:55,324 --> 01:07:00,276
well educated and sophisticated people, how
do they exist?

842
01:07:00,386 --> 01:07:10,326
They can manage them just like this (clicks
Her fingers) And you must see the intentions

843
01:07:10,386 --> 01:07:21,466
of the person: why a person should exploit,
what is the need of the person.

844
01:07:21,506 --> 01:07:25,586
People don’t even see the credibility of
a personality who comes here.

845
01:07:25,586 --> 01:07:26,616
It’s very surprising.

846
01:07:26,616 --> 01:07:28,336
Like one guru came here.

847
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:36,656
I would say, it’s something, another foolishness
who was living in a tin shed, that is what

848
01:07:36,656 --> 01:07:44,119
Peter told me in South Africa, and thousands
and thousands of people are his disciples.

849
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:46,869
To such an extent you will be surprised.

850
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:53,279
I mean, I don’t know what to say, this is
complete blindness.

851
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:57,032
I went to Norwich, so far away.

852
01:07:57,062 --> 01:07:59,632
This fellow has come to London only.

853
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:08,345
And I met three elderly ladies who were his
disciples and this gentleman was later on

854
01:08:08,345 --> 01:08:16,785
found to be having whisky every night and
using women, and he had all kinds of things.

855
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:23,245
And his private secretary herself disclosed
everything about him.

856
01:08:23,245 --> 01:08:26,206
And then they found it out and they verified
it.

857
01:08:26,246 --> 01:08:32,116
But these three foolish women still said,
“Whatever it is Mother we cannot give him

858
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,426
up, we love him."

859
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:36,398
Now what to do to with such stupid women?

860
01:08:36,398 --> 01:08:38,348
You just tell me.

861
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:46,878
I mean the question of you also wanting to
get exploited! I mean he is exposed, everybody

862
01:08:46,943 --> 01:08:54,983
knows about it, this gentleman about whom
I told you who was asking for a Rolls Royce,

863
01:08:54,983 --> 01:08:58,263
was caught for smuggling three hundred watches
in India.

864
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:02,782
I mean how can a man like that be interested
in smuggling?

865
01:09:02,782 --> 01:09:09,330
Just think of that! But all these people who
carried those watches went to the police and

866
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:11,750
said, “We brought it for ourselves."

867
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:20,190
Three hundred watches this fellow was carrying!
And they would not give in.

868
01:09:21,013 --> 01:09:28,403
And when he went to jail, they put a big show,
and the Indian government did not know what

869
01:09:28,403 --> 01:09:31,963
to do so they said, “All right you take
him away.

870
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:36,555
We don’t want to keep him in jail that otherwise
your government will come and say why our

871
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:42,971
three hundred Britishers are arrested,”
imagine! So they sent all the bad lock, stock

872
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:45,365
and barrel back.

873
01:09:46,085 --> 01:09:48,275
So he came back here.

874
01:09:48,275 --> 01:09:51,355
From here he has gone to America.

875
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:57,465
Now if you don’t want to see: I mean, isn’t
it clear cut what I said?

876
01:09:57,465 --> 01:09:58,965
So clear cut.

877
01:09:58,965 --> 01:10:01,826
If you don’t want to see it what can you
do?

878
01:10:01,826 --> 01:10:06,456
I mean I tell you, sometimes I feel it is
the people who want to get exploited or they

879
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:08,836
don’t want to see it.

880
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:13,606
Now I would like one of them to speak to you
it would be a good idea.

881
01:10:13,606 --> 01:10:18,506
Because you will know how he was caught and
how he was disillusioned.

882
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,506
Peter (Pierce)?

883
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:22,156
Is he there, just tell him.

884
01:10:22,156 --> 01:10:25,496
So you will know how he was befooled.

885
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:34,846
He was supposed to be a great, he is, he was,
a great diamond merchant from South Africa;

886
01:10:34,846 --> 01:10:41,726
married a granddaughter of a Duke of your
country, and that the granddaughter is also

887
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:42,726
here.

888
01:10:42,726 --> 01:10:43,726
Peter?

889
01:10:43,726 --> 01:10:44,856
Where is he?

890
01:10:44,856 --> 01:10:45,936
Peter?

891
01:10:45,936 --> 01:10:51,221
I would like you to tell them what happened
with you and how you got exploited.

892
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:53,501
That would be a better idea.

893
01:10:53,496 --> 01:10:56,261
You have it from your own kith and kin.

894
01:10:56,756 --> 01:10:57,756
Just tell them.
