00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:09.034
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.492
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:16.158
when you are all leaving this country,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.450
and this kind of a special type of a puja

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.450
that we are having today.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:31.076
This is the puja done to the sun,

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:35.700
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:43.492
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:45.450
Capricorn is Makar.

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:50.117
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.659
towards the tropic of Cancer,

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.242
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.325
it has something to do with the sun.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:03.450
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.617
because they have to deal with the sun.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.492
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:10.492
that they have put it on the fifteenth

00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.242
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:18.534
Now today is, they are changing,

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.034
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:30.575
We've got six months when this moves,

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:33.951
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:38.575
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.449
from tomorrow.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.534
So today is the last day, which we say that

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:50.200
is the day which is the coldest day,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.242
according to Indian understanding.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.534
After this the heat will start growing

00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:02.450
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.325
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:09.659
during the summer-time.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.158
Though it's very hot in summer,

00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:15.992
still people wants the sun to rule us

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:17.909
and to give us warmth because,

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:24.034
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:26.825
all the fruits, everything grows.

00:02:27.492 --> 00:02:31.909
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:33.784
we call it as "Sankrant,"

00:02:33.784 --> 00:02:36.075
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:38.951
That is when of course in the,

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:44.826
in the European countries or say in England or America,

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:50.158
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:55.492
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:59.076
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:01.617
means the end of the calamity is over.

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:05.700
And they give something sweet to eat

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:09.826
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:13.116
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:17.992
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:21.742
also want you to retain the heat

00:03:21.992 --> 00:03:25.158
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.158
This is all thought of in a way,

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:29.492
in a very gross level,

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:30.951
on a very gross level,

00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:34.492
that we should keep the people warm enough.

00:03:34.742 --> 00:03:36.700
Also it is said that

00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:43.034
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:46.242
for people, because it is the coldest day.

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:50.076
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

00:03:50.283 --> 00:03:53.158
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:55.034
- means "you say something sweet to us."

00:03:56.117 --> 00:03:59.742
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

00:03:59.992 --> 00:04:02.826
than the people who live in colder places,

00:04:03.158 --> 00:04:06.699
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.951
I don't blame them for their temperament,

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:11.699
because the nature is so unkind.

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:14.034
In India you can live anywhere:

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:15.867
you can live under a tree,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.034
you can live in a forest,

00:04:19.034 --> 00:04:21.283
anywhere you can live quite happily,

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:25.283
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.408
And there's not such a problem as

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.324
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:34.450
where if you have to go out of the house

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.116
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:40.034
Here you just can walk out of the house,

00:04:40.034 --> 00:04:43.034
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.867
and there's no problem of any kind

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:48.034
as far as the nature is concerned.

00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:52.742
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:57.575
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:00.867
people feel very happy during that time,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.909
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:15.700
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.283
Because of that,

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.200
people keep more to their houses,

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.783
to artificial heating or other heatings,

00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:24.117
and the doors are closed,

00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:26.033
the hearts are closed,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.116
and it's difficult for them to

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.117
communicate with other people.

00:05:35.076 --> 00:05:39.450
As you go down south more in your countries also,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.700
you'll find people are warmer,

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:43.908
simpler,

00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:49.783
very hospitable.

00:05:50.492 --> 00:05:55.158
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

00:05:55.492 --> 00:05:59.158
and a kind of a inviting heart.

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:02.867
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

00:06:03.116 --> 00:06:05.450
the sun line is the right side

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.951
and the moon, moon is the left side.

00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:11.116
On the moon line

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:14.659
one can desire but cannot act.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.909
Apart from that, on the moon line

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.867
if you go too far it can be destructive.

00:06:21.283 --> 00:06:23.992
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:29.033
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:33.867
no work - then you start thinking too much,

00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:39.534
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

00:06:39.534 --> 00:06:40.992
no action.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.992
And without the action

00:06:42.992 --> 00:06:45.575
this energy can become very destructive.

00:06:46.034 --> 00:06:48.534
That is why we find that people,

00:06:48.534 --> 00:06:50.534
they say that "empty mind,

00:06:50.784 --> 00:06:56.534
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

00:06:57.325 --> 00:06:59.742
Where people have, do not act,

00:07:00.408 --> 00:07:02.408
when the action doesn't take place,

00:07:02.408 --> 00:07:04.784
then it can be quite destructive...

00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:17.283
So the whole situation is different

00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:18.992
in a country which is warm,

00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:21.325
and a country which is not warm.

00:07:22.116 --> 00:07:25.534
But in a country where it is very warm also,

00:07:25.534 --> 00:07:26.909
like Africa,

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:30.325
there are complications due to too much of heat.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:36.450
Like we have the tropic of -

00:07:37.283 --> 00:07:39.742
mean the equator passing through,

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:42.867
and it heats up that area so much

00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:47.158
that it becomes full of jungles,

00:07:47.158 --> 00:07:50.116
very high trees and tall trees;

00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:54.116
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:56.534
that there's no possibility

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.867
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:05.742
and it's quite dark,

00:08:06.034 --> 00:08:07.408
it's full of darkness.

00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:11.826
So that extreme also comes in the same category

00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:14.617
as the extreme of the cold season.

00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:16.826
Now such people live there

00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:21.575
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:23.867
so they do not grow much;

00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:26.951
and they can be primitive people

00:08:27.283 --> 00:08:29.492
and they can be quite aggressive,

00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:32.242
like they learn things from the animals

00:08:32.242 --> 00:08:35.076
and they could be quite aggressive.

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:38.157
So the balance has to be struck,

00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:40.408
and the balance is that,

00:08:40.742 --> 00:08:47.867
that we should desire and act.

00:08:48.242 --> 00:08:53.575
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.076
there is a division of labor, I think,

00:08:57.492 --> 00:09:02.367
that one part of the country is thinking,

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:06.117
another part of the country is acting.

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:09.951
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

00:09:10.408 --> 00:09:14.492
So a balance has to be struck where

00:09:14.826 --> 00:09:18.033
you have the Sushumna working out.

00:09:18.034 --> 00:09:21.492
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

00:09:23.034 --> 00:09:25.867
one would say is the equator - it's not,

00:09:25.867 --> 00:09:27.242
is not the equator,

00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:30.951
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

00:09:31.283 --> 00:09:34.283
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.282
and that has to act;

00:09:36.283 --> 00:09:41.367
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:45.283
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:49.992
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

00:09:49.992 --> 00:09:51.867
like a big pole

00:09:51.867 --> 00:09:54.992
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.200
There is nothing that is material

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.575
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

00:10:02.575 --> 00:10:04.200
but it's the energy force

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.783
which acts in such a manner

00:10:06.784 --> 00:10:11.534
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

00:10:11.534 --> 00:10:14.867
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.325
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

00:10:19.325 --> 00:10:22.908
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:24.575
to give us a balance.

00:10:25.117 --> 00:10:29.116
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

00:10:29.325 --> 00:10:35.658
that half of the countries get the sun

00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:37.575
during the summer-time,

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:41.992
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.867
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

00:10:46.116 --> 00:10:47.034
Apart from that,

00:10:47.034 --> 00:10:51.784
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:56.408
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

00:10:56.784 --> 00:11:01.117
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

00:11:02.784 --> 00:11:07.200
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:12.034
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

00:11:12.034 --> 00:11:14.117
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:18.575
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

00:11:18.909 --> 00:11:23.659
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:25.575
and all that takes place.

00:11:25.909 --> 00:11:28.325
This axis is the one which moves.

00:11:28.575 --> 00:11:31.407
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:36.283
moves the lava into different directions

00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:44.325
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:47.158
and also to have

00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:54.826
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

00:11:55.158 --> 00:12:00.826
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

00:12:00.826 --> 00:12:02.076
what is to be done.

00:12:02.408 --> 00:12:05.158
This axis is the one that loves us.

00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:08.617
Because of this axis we,

00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:10.826
we have seasons.

00:12:10.826 --> 00:12:14.492
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:17.575
different, different varieties of food

00:12:17.575 --> 00:12:20.076
and varieties of things.

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:25.076
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

00:12:25.283 --> 00:12:28.617
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:33.283
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:36.158
and we'll have no food, nothing,

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.117
and it will be like moon living here.

00:12:39.951 --> 00:12:42.282
Now it has been specially created:

00:12:43.158 --> 00:12:46.242
first the Mother Earth when it was created

00:12:46.742 --> 00:12:49.158
through the heat of the sun,

00:12:50.492 --> 00:12:53.951
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:58.158
Then she was brought very close to the moon

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.242
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

00:13:01.242 --> 00:13:02.826
it was all snow.

00:13:03.076 --> 00:13:06.742
Then it was brought closer to the sun

00:13:07.034 --> 00:13:09.617
and moved at a point where

00:13:09.617 --> 00:13:12.367
life could start working,

00:13:12.617 --> 00:13:15.826
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

00:13:16.117 --> 00:13:19.034
to make life grow in that area.

00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:21.242
Now when the life started growing,

00:13:21.242 --> 00:13:25.951
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

00:13:26.116 --> 00:13:29.534
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

00:13:29.534 --> 00:13:31.742
because there's heat in the axis,

00:13:31.742 --> 00:13:34.867
the energy of heat that converts

00:13:38.742 --> 00:13:43.116
the plants into carbon.

00:13:43.492 --> 00:13:45.992
Now this carbon is, later on

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.826
forms the basis for,

00:13:48.826 --> 00:13:51.534
we can say,

00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:58.116
for the production of carbohydrates,

00:13:58.116 --> 00:13:59.367
you can say,

00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:01.951
or all organic matter.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:06.283
But to create life we had to have another help,

00:14:06.283 --> 00:14:07.867
is the nitrogen;

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:11.408
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

00:14:11.408 --> 00:14:15.534
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

00:14:15.951 --> 00:14:18.408
And when it created this nitrogen,

00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:21.117
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

00:14:21.408 --> 00:14:24.825
and when the amino acids were created within us,

00:14:25.242 --> 00:14:32.158
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:36.659
Of course this was done in the ocean,

00:14:36.951 --> 00:14:39.700
because in the ocean with the movement,

00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:43.116
nitrogen was created and life was created,

00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:46.283
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

00:14:46.534 --> 00:14:49.534
and that's how we have amino acids.

00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:53.242
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

00:14:53.617 --> 00:14:56.242
gave us the combinations and permutations,

00:14:56.492 --> 00:14:57.534
different lives.

00:14:58.283 --> 00:15:00.825
So in the whole evolutionary process

00:15:00.826 --> 00:15:04.826
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

00:15:05.158 --> 00:15:07.283
In the same way in human beings,

00:15:07.534 --> 00:15:10.408
the axis is the most important thing.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.867
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

00:15:15.158 --> 00:15:17.534
We have to stand on our axis.

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:20.367
Those who do not stand on their axis,

00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:23.742
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

00:15:23.992 --> 00:15:28.283
are capable of complete destruction;

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.408
because either they will be destroyed by

00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:35.158
too much of right side or too much of left side.

00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:39.992
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

00:15:40.283 --> 00:15:43.242
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:46.617
can have problems of different chakras,

00:15:46.992 --> 00:15:52.367
of different kind of quality in a person.

00:15:53.617 --> 00:15:56.575
A person who stretches his axis too much,

00:15:56.575 --> 00:15:58.617
puts back his head like this,

00:15:58.617 --> 00:16:00.867
is a person who is very right-sided

00:16:00.867 --> 00:16:03.575
and creates problem with his ego;

00:16:03.575 --> 00:16:05.951
and the one who absolutely bends down

00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:10.867
like a slavish person also is a person

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:13.408
who goes towards his destructiveness.

00:16:13.408 --> 00:16:18.283
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

00:16:18.617 --> 00:16:20.617
one trying to dominate another,

00:16:20.617 --> 00:16:24.867
and when they start dominating another person

00:16:24.867 --> 00:16:26.992
they actually destroy themselves,

00:16:26.992 --> 00:16:30.034
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

00:16:30.034 --> 00:16:31.367
For example now,

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:35.867
we have seen that we had

00:16:36.617 --> 00:16:38.951
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

00:16:39.158 --> 00:16:42.492
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:44.324
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

00:16:44.325 --> 00:16:45.575
some other people.

00:16:46.076 --> 00:16:48.492
But everything that they did to dominate

00:16:48.492 --> 00:16:50.575
and all that has double reactions.

00:16:50.826 --> 00:16:53.158
First of all by their domination, say,

00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:55.242
Indians became very slavish,

00:16:55.742 --> 00:16:58.826
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

00:16:59.117 --> 00:17:01.700
and they do not have that independent axis

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.951
as they should have.

00:17:02.951 --> 00:17:05.242
Extremely slavish people they are.

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:07.450
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.742
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

00:17:09.742 --> 00:17:11.826
I find they are so very slavish.

00:17:11.826 --> 00:17:16.283
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

00:17:16.283 --> 00:17:19.034
to please the white-skinned people.

00:17:20.158 --> 00:17:25.117
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

00:17:26.617 --> 00:17:30.492
That added to the ego of the whites,

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:32.825
added to the ego of the whites,

00:17:32.826 --> 00:17:35.034
and today you see what's happening is

00:17:35.242 --> 00:17:37.117
all that ego is destroying them.

00:17:37.575 --> 00:17:40.575
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:44.158
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

00:17:44.492 --> 00:17:47.742
One has to understand that what is the best

00:17:47.742 --> 00:17:50.117
within a human being is his axis,

00:17:50.117 --> 00:17:52.076
and everybody has an axis,

00:17:52.283 --> 00:17:55.742
and one must respect the axis of every person.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:18:00.117
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:02.826
I know you by your chakras,

00:18:02.826 --> 00:18:04.076
by your Sushumna,

00:18:04.076 --> 00:18:05.700
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:09.076
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

00:18:09.283 --> 00:18:11.492
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

00:18:11.492 --> 00:18:14.909
I know you as a person with a very superficial

00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:17.117
type of a Sushumna.

00:18:17.617 --> 00:18:21.575
And even if you make up something

00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:25.034
by sort of being very nice or good,

00:18:25.283 --> 00:18:27.242
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

00:18:27.242 --> 00:18:29.492
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:33.700
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

00:18:33.951 --> 00:18:36.076
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:36.076 --> 00:18:38.117
I know how deep you are.

00:18:39.492 --> 00:18:41.158
So the depth on the axis

00:18:41.158 --> 00:18:43.492
is more important than anything else.

00:18:43.742 --> 00:18:47.242
Your axis has to be very deep.

00:18:47.408 --> 00:18:48.992
Now you will say that "Mother,

00:18:48.992 --> 00:18:53.283
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

00:18:53.575 --> 00:18:57.742
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

00:18:57.992 --> 00:19:03.492
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

00:19:04.158 --> 00:19:07.617
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

00:19:08.617 --> 00:19:11.117
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

00:19:11.408 --> 00:19:15.492
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

00:19:15.492 --> 00:19:20.492
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

00:19:20.742 --> 00:19:24.575
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

00:19:24.826 --> 00:19:26.283
and all the rest of them

00:19:26.283 --> 00:19:31.242
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

00:19:31.242 --> 00:19:34.158
while the people who are not deep, their outside

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:40.283
what you call the foldings are bigger

00:19:40.283 --> 00:19:43.158
than the inside small thing.

00:19:43.408 --> 00:19:47.075
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

00:19:47.076 --> 00:19:49.951
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:52.117
may look to be very good-looking

00:19:52.117 --> 00:19:54.367
or whatever it may be outwardly,

00:19:55.158 --> 00:19:57.742
but inwardly they are not deep.

00:19:58.158 --> 00:20:00.117
Inwardly if they are deep,

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:03.992
their whole attitude is beautiful.

00:20:04.283 --> 00:20:06.283
They are very joy-giving people,

00:20:06.826 --> 00:20:08.408
they are very joy-giving.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.117
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:16.575
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

00:20:16.575 --> 00:20:19.951
but the joy won't be really that deep;

00:20:20.158 --> 00:20:22.699
it would be like a joy-killing.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.117
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

00:20:29.575 --> 00:20:33.951
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

00:20:34.158 --> 00:20:38.617
the proper effort we have to put in.

00:20:39.283 --> 00:20:44.283
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

00:20:44.867 --> 00:20:49.951
and some people have very, very what you should say,

00:20:50.242 --> 00:20:54.951
a very constricted type of the axis.

00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:57.617
This axis has to be grown.

00:20:57.617 --> 00:20:59.992
Now when you come for My puja and all that

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:01.867
I do expand it, I agree,

00:21:01.867 --> 00:21:05.617
but it is temporary thing.

00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:10.700
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

00:21:10.951 --> 00:21:12.951
in the collective also.

00:21:12.951 --> 00:21:18.158
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:21.158
But it should be done seriously.

00:21:21.408 --> 00:21:23.367
It should not be just a joke,

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:24.951
to be frivolous,

00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:27.617
to be stupid - that's not the way.

00:21:27.617 --> 00:21:31.492
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

00:21:31.492 --> 00:21:34.283
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.492
it's a meditative thing;

00:21:37.867 --> 00:21:40.742
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

00:21:40.992 --> 00:21:42.742
it's a puja to God.

00:21:44.408 --> 00:21:47.117
Is to be done with that reverence,

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:54.367
because reverence is the key of achievement.

00:21:55.575 --> 00:21:58.617
If you have no reverence about yourself

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:00.408
and no reverence of others,

00:22:00.408 --> 00:22:02.367
then it cannot be done.

00:22:02.367 --> 00:22:05.867
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:07.700
"What am I doing with my life?

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.992
Where am I wasting it?

00:22:08.992 --> 00:22:10.117
Why should I waste it?

00:22:10.117 --> 00:22:12.283
Why shouldn't I be deep?

00:22:12.283 --> 00:22:14.367
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:17.117
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

00:22:17.492 --> 00:22:20.909
All these things if they pop into your head,

00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:24.909
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

00:22:25.117 --> 00:22:28.325
because normally on small, small things people fight.

00:22:28.325 --> 00:22:32.492
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

00:22:32.492 --> 00:22:36.242
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

00:22:36.242 --> 00:22:40.200
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.117
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

00:22:43.492 --> 00:22:46.909
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

00:22:47.117 --> 00:22:50.076
even if he doesn't show off much,

00:22:50.325 --> 00:22:52.909
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

00:22:53.242 --> 00:22:55.784
he expresses himself through his depth,

00:22:55.784 --> 00:22:58.699
because I can work out better through that.

00:23:00.742 --> 00:23:03.117
So to develop this one must meditate,

00:23:03.117 --> 00:23:05.117
important thing is to meditate;

00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:07.867
every day, every day, every day.

00:23:07.867 --> 00:23:09.867
You may not eat your food one day,

00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:11.367
you may not sleep one day,

00:23:11.367 --> 00:23:14.408
you may not go to your office one day,

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.575
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

00:23:17.575 --> 00:23:19.742
- but you must meditate every day.

00:23:19.742 --> 00:23:21.367
That's an important point,

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:28.076
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:36.367
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.034
the first thing you will notice about yourself

00:23:39.034 --> 00:23:42.117
that you do not care for any comfort,

00:23:43.076 --> 00:23:45.492
you're not bothered about any,

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:49.534
any material thing.

00:23:49.992 --> 00:23:52.283
Whatever it is you are above it,

00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:54.534
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

00:23:54.534 --> 00:23:57.158
You just don't want to put your neck

00:23:57.158 --> 00:24:00.408
into a thing where you do not belong.

00:24:00.992 --> 00:24:02.242
You just get out of it,

00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:03.784
and you think that

00:24:04.534 --> 00:24:08.034
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.575
So your whole attention now moves inward.

00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:13.992
When the attention starts moving inward

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.992
then it expands more.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.450
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:24.324
and starts expanding and expanding.

00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:27.117
Now in small, small things also:

00:24:27.575 --> 00:24:29.034
say for example

00:24:29.951 --> 00:24:33.158
if I have not mentioned somebody

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:36.076
and mentioned somebody else,

00:24:37.492 --> 00:24:38.617
then they feel,

00:24:38.617 --> 00:24:40.992
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

00:24:40.992 --> 00:24:44.617
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:49.826
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

00:24:49.826 --> 00:24:53.158
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.784
But these outward things are,

00:24:55.784 --> 00:24:58.034
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

00:24:58.034 --> 00:25:00.367
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:01.617
didn't do that."

00:25:01.617 --> 00:25:04.117
All those things if it comes to your head,

00:25:04.117 --> 00:25:06.951
that means absolutely it's true

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.617
that there is something lacking in you.

00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:13.200
Or if you try to complain,

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.909
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:17.909
and I had to stand on this thing,"

00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:20.574
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:25.367
This widening comforts you.

00:25:25.826 --> 00:25:28.034
That's the comforting thing,

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.575
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

00:25:31.575 --> 00:25:37.034
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:43.242
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

00:25:45.951 --> 00:25:48.450
And this one has to develop,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.450
through meditative effort.

00:25:50.826 --> 00:25:54.659
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

00:25:54.659 --> 00:25:57.242
as it is today is a collective happening.

00:25:58.076 --> 00:26:00.951
I find especially among Indian men,

00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:03.158
they never do any work with their hands,

00:26:03.158 --> 00:26:04.574
which is a wrong thing.

00:26:04.575 --> 00:26:07.367
Because they don't use their hands at all

00:26:07.617 --> 00:26:09.617
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

00:26:09.617 --> 00:26:11.951
Indians have the worst collectivity.

00:26:12.826 --> 00:26:14.117
If you have an ashram,

00:26:14.117 --> 00:26:15.784
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

00:26:15.784 --> 00:26:17.449
nobody is going to stay there.

00:26:18.784 --> 00:26:20.784
They want to have their own houses,

00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:22.116
their own families,

00:26:22.116 --> 00:26:23.700
their own children;

00:26:23.951 --> 00:26:26.450
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.450
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:34.909
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

00:26:35.367 --> 00:26:37.659
- leave alone repairing anything.

00:26:37.951 --> 00:26:41.784
They will stand with their hands on their hips

00:26:41.784 --> 00:26:45.784
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

00:26:46.117 --> 00:26:47.700
There's a Marathi saying,

00:26:47.951 --> 00:26:50.492
a very interesting ....

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:58.076
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

00:26:59.826 --> 00:27:02.158
So that is very typical of Indian men.

00:27:02.408 --> 00:27:03.825
They cannot repair anything,

00:27:03.826 --> 00:27:05.367
they cannot do anything.

00:27:05.367 --> 00:27:07.951
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:09.492
they'll just stand like this, watch,

00:27:09.492 --> 00:27:11.492
they'll never put their hands to it.

00:27:11.492 --> 00:27:14.742
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

00:27:14.742 --> 00:27:17.283
what we call as shramadaan.

00:27:18.742 --> 00:27:20.951
They have to do some shramadaan.

00:27:21.158 --> 00:27:24.992
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

00:27:26.951 --> 00:27:29.492
and that is what we lack.

00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:35.116
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

00:27:35.116 --> 00:27:37.283
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

00:27:37.283 --> 00:27:39.742
try to put some garden around your house,

00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:41.534
try to paint your house,

00:27:41.534 --> 00:27:43.992
do some sort of a work with your hand

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.158
which even if you don't have anything,

00:27:47.158 --> 00:27:51.283
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

00:27:51.283 --> 00:27:55.742
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

00:27:55.742 --> 00:27:57.867
because I don't think people even do that.

00:27:58.367 --> 00:27:59.992
Even they don't shave themselves,

00:27:59.992 --> 00:28:02.492
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

00:28:02.492 --> 00:28:05.408
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

00:28:05.659 --> 00:28:08.408
Now, but on the contrary

00:28:08.408 --> 00:28:11.367
we see in the West people use their hands.

00:28:11.659 --> 00:28:13.867
Because of that, you see,

00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:16.617
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:19.867
So they score a point on being collective,

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.992
while the Indians score a point because

00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:23.909
they are Indians and they have a heritage

00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:25.116
and they know what is Kundalini,

00:28:25.116 --> 00:28:27.450
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

00:28:27.867 --> 00:28:29.659
So they score a point this side.

00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:31.574
So it's the left side is the desire,

00:28:31.575 --> 00:28:33.116
the right side is the action;

00:28:33.116 --> 00:28:35.992
again we come back to the same position where

00:28:35.992 --> 00:28:37.408
we have an imbalance,

00:28:37.408 --> 00:28:39.784
that the action takes place in the West,

00:28:40.116 --> 00:28:44.700
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

00:28:44.992 --> 00:28:47.575
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:51.200
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.867
Now we are building one single ashram

00:28:54.117 --> 00:28:57.534
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

00:28:59.909 --> 00:29:02.950
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

00:29:06.826 --> 00:29:09.617
And it's so difficult, you see,

00:29:10.034 --> 00:29:12.158
to understand why they have taken so much time

00:29:12.158 --> 00:29:14.617
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

00:29:15.076 --> 00:29:18.826
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

00:29:19.117 --> 00:29:21.951
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

00:29:22.325 --> 00:29:24.617
everything is to be done tomorrow.

00:29:24.617 --> 00:29:25.951
"This we will do tomorrow."

00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:28.951
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

00:29:29.158 --> 00:29:33.617
Like we used to have in the school,

00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:39.909
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:43.117
see, there were: one house was built,

00:29:43.117 --> 00:29:46.367
three persons came to work and one ran away.

00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:50.575
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

00:29:50.575 --> 00:29:51.909
and two ran away;

00:29:52.325 --> 00:29:56.158
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

00:29:56.492 --> 00:29:58.784
So how, when will the house be finished?

00:29:59.034 --> 00:30:00.617
Never!

00:30:01.158 --> 00:30:06.449
With such runaways it can never be finished.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.617
It's like that.

00:30:07.617 --> 00:30:10.784
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

00:30:11.034 --> 00:30:13.492
I was saying that all Indians must find out

00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:17.699
some place where they could go and plant something.

00:30:18.158 --> 00:30:20.199
Get hold of some sort of a place

00:30:20.492 --> 00:30:24.325
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

00:30:24.784 --> 00:30:27.574
water it together, work it out together.

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:30.117
Now the Indian women are that way better.

00:30:30.117 --> 00:30:33.158
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

00:30:33.158 --> 00:30:34.574
and all that,

00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:36.617
but the other part is missing.

00:30:36.951 --> 00:30:38.826
The other part is intelligence,

00:30:39.076 --> 00:30:41.075
it's the other part is to think.

00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:43.699
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.909
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:51.117
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

00:30:51.117 --> 00:30:52.492
a lemon with his food.

00:30:52.492 --> 00:30:53.909
Now there's no lemon in the house.

00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:56.157
This woman would run up and down all over the place

00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:58.034
to get the lemon for the husband,

00:30:58.034 --> 00:30:59.909
otherwise he will not eat the food.

00:30:59.909 --> 00:31:00.617
Doesn't matter,

00:31:00.617 --> 00:31:02.492
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

00:31:06.575 --> 00:31:07.951
But the women will try,

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.157
because you see they must keep their,

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:11.617
they understand one thing

00:31:11.617 --> 00:31:13.450
that you must keep their palate all right.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.909
Then they are quite sensible in India

00:31:16.117 --> 00:31:18.115
because here they're real tigers,

00:31:18.115 --> 00:31:19.909
all the husbands are like tigers,

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:22.200
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.826
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.575
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

00:31:28.575 --> 00:31:30.034
the husbands are like,

00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:33.325
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

00:31:40.992 --> 00:31:43.826
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.659
and when they go to West,

00:31:45.659 --> 00:31:48.909
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

00:31:49.117 --> 00:31:51.992
Something surprising how they change immediately

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.784
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

00:31:54.784 --> 00:31:56.034
and all those things,

00:31:56.034 --> 00:31:57.659
but they become like that.

00:31:57.909 --> 00:32:01.367
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:03.325
when he doesn't understand

00:32:03.325 --> 00:32:05.659
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

00:32:05.659 --> 00:32:09.407
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.242
This balance comes through our depth,

00:32:14.242 --> 00:32:16.450
and that depth has to be improved.

00:32:17.076 --> 00:32:21.992
Not through just by talking about it,

00:32:22.283 --> 00:32:24.158
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:24.158 --> 00:32:27.534
but actually seriously doing meditation,

00:32:27.534 --> 00:32:30.282
actually seriously doing meditation.

00:32:34.242 --> 00:32:37.408
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

00:32:37.826 --> 00:32:40.659
Now we have in India, say, architects.

00:32:41.617 --> 00:32:44.283
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

00:32:44.283 --> 00:32:48.408
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:50.617
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

00:32:50.617 --> 00:32:53.283
And now they have problems, practical problems,

00:32:53.617 --> 00:32:55.784
they cannot nail one nail.

00:32:56.367 --> 00:33:00.826
All are what you call them as white-collar...

00:33:01.367 --> 00:33:04.325
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

00:33:04.659 --> 00:33:07.117
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.116
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

00:33:10.367 --> 00:33:13.367
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:17.867
So under these circumstances one has to understand

00:33:17.867 --> 00:33:22.325
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

00:33:22.659 --> 00:33:25.450
as far as collectivity is concerned,

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.117
so let us be collective.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.700
Let us try to do something collective.

00:33:30.116 --> 00:33:33.117
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

00:33:33.117 --> 00:33:38.534
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.700
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.200
to their children nicely;

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.534
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:53.909
Now the other side is that the Western people

00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:56.450
care so much for collectivity that

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.784
whatever it is they try to compromise,

00:33:59.116 --> 00:34:01.867
and try to keep the family life all right.

00:34:01.867 --> 00:34:04.659
So it's the two extremes as we have.

00:34:06.034 --> 00:34:10.034
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

00:34:10.325 --> 00:34:12.116
the family life is going strong.

00:34:12.325 --> 00:34:16.408
But if you see such men in England,

00:34:16.408 --> 00:34:19.242
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

00:34:19.242 --> 00:34:21.992
that Indian men do to their women here.

00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:27.867
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.408
So the balance between the women and men:

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.826
what is the axis, is the home.

00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:36.367
Home is the axis.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.450
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:41.200
What do you think about,

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.700
what is your problem?

00:34:42.992 --> 00:34:44.575
Where is your attention,

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.367
what do you discuss?

00:34:47.116 --> 00:34:48.909
That's very important to see.

00:34:49.325 --> 00:34:50.992
In that you'll find out

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.200
what is going on in the family.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.867
Say you are talking ill of each other,

00:34:56.325 --> 00:34:59.575
if you are telling your child against your husband,

00:34:59.867 --> 00:35:01.867
husband is telling the wife against,

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.450
telling the children about, against the,

00:35:07.992 --> 00:35:10.242
against the husband, like that.

00:35:10.242 --> 00:35:11.951
If it is going on like that,

00:35:12.158 --> 00:35:13.242
then what happens,

00:35:13.242 --> 00:35:16.742
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

00:35:16.742 --> 00:35:18.951
The axis is love,

00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:21.367
axis is love,

00:35:21.367 --> 00:35:25.076
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

00:35:25.492 --> 00:35:29.158
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

00:35:29.617 --> 00:35:32.117
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

00:35:34.367 --> 00:35:40.117
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

00:35:40.117 --> 00:35:43.325
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:48.909
If people get realization before they are developed,

00:35:48.909 --> 00:35:52.951
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

00:35:53.534 --> 00:35:55.282
We don't have to become communist,

00:35:55.283 --> 00:35:56.951
we don't have to do anything like that,

00:35:56.951 --> 00:35:59.116
because communists are just the same as Americans,

00:35:59.116 --> 00:36:01.867
there's no difference at all in temperament.

00:36:02.742 --> 00:36:06.283
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

00:36:06.283 --> 00:36:08.492
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

00:36:08.492 --> 00:36:10.158
and if a Russian is sent to America

00:36:10.158 --> 00:36:12.867
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

00:36:13.617 --> 00:36:15.283
There's no change at all.

00:36:15.283 --> 00:36:20.867
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

00:36:22.534 --> 00:36:26.157
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

00:36:27.534 --> 00:36:32.116
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

00:36:32.367 --> 00:36:34.408
then any amount of development,

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:36.659
any amount of all these things

00:36:37.158 --> 00:36:40.742
cannot destroy that country,

00:36:40.742 --> 00:36:42.367
cannot create wars.

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:44.283
There will be peace everywhere,

00:36:44.283 --> 00:36:46.283
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

00:36:46.283 --> 00:36:48.951
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

00:36:49.158 --> 00:36:51.867
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

00:36:52.116 --> 00:36:55.282
and we have to look forward to the new age

00:36:55.283 --> 00:37:02.867
of a new moon blessing us,

00:37:03.116 --> 00:37:06.157
and the great sun coming over

00:37:06.867 --> 00:37:09.659
to give us all the energy we need,

00:37:10.408 --> 00:37:15.992
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:16.242 --> 00:37:18.116
May God bless you all.

00:37:26.575 --> 00:37:27.784
Now for the puja,

00:37:27.784 --> 00:37:29.826
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

00:37:29.826 --> 00:37:33.659
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

00:39:01.992 --> 00:39:03.575
From the foreign country,

00:39:03.575 --> 00:39:07.408
who is going to stay after the

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.575
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

00:39:18.575 --> 00:39:24.492
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

00:39:25.575 --> 00:39:30.450
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

00:39:31.117 --> 00:39:32.742
All right, let's put it,

00:39:32.742 --> 00:39:36.826
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

00:39:44.867 --> 00:39:47.034
When are these people going?

00:39:47.617 --> 00:39:50.492
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

00:39:51.076 --> 00:39:54.449
when are they going, when are you going?

00:39:56.492 --> 00:40:00.117
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

00:40:00.492 --> 00:40:03.117
What about you, John?

00:40:17.117 --> 00:40:21.117
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

00:40:21.117 --> 00:40:23.283
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

00:40:28.076 --> 00:40:30.076
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

00:40:30.076 --> 00:40:34.449
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

00:40:35.575 --> 00:40:37.367
like that, in the near future,

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.575
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:54.242
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

00:41:01.076 --> 00:41:05.157
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

00:41:05.492 --> 00:41:08.492
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

00:41:08.492 --> 00:41:11.742
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

00:41:12.283 --> 00:41:13.826
It's not meant for ladies at all,

00:41:13.826 --> 00:41:16.242
and I have only one room where I live.

00:41:16.242 --> 00:41:19.242
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

00:41:27.575 --> 00:41:29.367
Let them go to Alibagh,

00:41:29.742 --> 00:41:32.700
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

00:41:33.076 --> 00:41:36.909
to people who will be looking after them.

00:41:37.283 --> 00:41:39.242
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

00:41:39.492 --> 00:41:43.034
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

00:41:44.617 --> 00:41:45.951
Fifty, all right.

00:41:46.826 --> 00:41:50.449
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

00:41:54.575 --> 00:41:57.575
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

00:41:58.034 --> 00:41:59.157
You can come to Pratishthan

00:41:59.158 --> 00:42:01.158
if you want to take some photographs or things,

00:42:01.575 --> 00:42:03.742
but it's a liability for us because,

00:42:03.742 --> 00:42:06.076
you see, unless and until you go back,

00:42:06.283 --> 00:42:08.575
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

00:42:08.867 --> 00:42:10.700
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

00:42:10.951 --> 00:42:13.282
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

00:42:13.742 --> 00:42:15.909
And then you'd better book yourself,

00:42:16.158 --> 00:42:18.700
because this must go out of our country,

00:42:19.034 --> 00:42:20.826
otherwise they're always on our head,

00:42:22.575 --> 00:42:24.117
and they are following us.

00:42:24.784 --> 00:42:27.450
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

00:42:27.992 --> 00:42:29.742
stuff that you are carrying.

00:42:30.116 --> 00:42:32.867
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

00:42:34.117 --> 00:42:36.867
You can finish the photography there,

00:42:37.116 --> 00:42:38.574
and you fix up your going.

00:42:39.117 --> 00:42:41.784
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

00:42:42.283 --> 00:42:46.659
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

00:42:47.116 --> 00:42:48.449
Alibagh is better...

00:42:51.367 --> 00:42:54.909
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

00:42:55.117 --> 00:42:57.242
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

00:43:09.617 --> 00:43:11.076
All right, so done.

00:43:11.076 --> 00:43:14.324
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

00:43:16.575 --> 00:43:18.909
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:21.450
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

00:43:21.826 --> 00:43:23.699
and they can leave.
