00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:01.730
Really?

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.570
I can't...can't focus.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.130
The whole mind is conditioned.

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:08.647
I mean, absolutely. It is like a record.
Like a gramophone record going round.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:14.537
Yes. I have seen this in China when,
I went there when Mao was there.

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:18.805
See, the girl used to tell us
anything as if it was a record.

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:23.367
She was just saying it, without even thinking about it.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.257
See then I felt that this is some sort
of a possession this girl has got.

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:30.727
But now, of course, Chinese have got their
freedom and they are much better people,

00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:32.227
I mean they’re not that kind.

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:39.946
But in the beginning, they did that like that in
China and this is how they just conditioned them.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:45.057
But all our theological colleges,
all these people are the same.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.671
They are just trying to find
out how to condition people.

00:00:52.983 --> 00:00:58.402
I mean, if they give all their business and just
take to God, they will be so very much happier.

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:00.942
And all this effort will be lost.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:09.708
Very serious things. You see, for
Christian community especially I think,

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:16.061
it is that because of these
barriers, they may never reach God.

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:22.597
It’s all right for Christians in the West because
they have seen the nonsense of it, most of them.

00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:27.968
But in the countries like ours,
you see which are developing,

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:31.442
for them Christianity being
so sophisticated, so good,

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:33.942
you see to them, Christians mean something great.

00:01:37.352 --> 00:01:47.373
My husband was telling Me that his own uncle wanted to become a Christian because he found that Hindu religion was so absurd,

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.383
and the priests were so absurd.

00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:52.133
So he was so enamoured by Christians.

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.541
I tell you.

00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.441
I suppose our biggest
problem is the Christians.

00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:07.994
We really don’t have any other barrier here.

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:13.355
We have quite a few Muslims.
They can be a bit fanatical too.

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:18.154
And the conversion, you see.
Conversion is another problem.

00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:27.133
Conversion in India is more in the places
where there are jungles and things

00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:29.656
where the people are
absolutely away from society.

00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:32.013
So for them, money is very important,

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:39.443
and the way these people take the missionaries and their
food and this and that, so they are converting you.

00:02:39.443 --> 00:02:41.713
I mean donkeys after donkeys.

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:44.213
But they have created
problems for us in the way,

00:02:44.213 --> 00:02:56.959
that these people say who are living in Khasia, Jaintia, all
these places you see – a former Nagaland sort of a thing.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.317
And this Nagaland business
is all a Christian problem.

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:04.417
They have all become Christians you
see and don’t understand anything.

00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:10.237
At the time of Christ, I don’t
know if He ever went to this;

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:12.761
it’s such primitive people.

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:17.621
But Christianity has gone to them. They
don’t understand anything – A to Z.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.611
Now they came to Lal Bahadur
Shastri, our Prime Minister

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.382
and they said that, “We
must have our sovereignty.”

00:03:26.378 --> 00:03:30.302
That’s what they said. They had written
it down in their language, ‘sovereignty’.

00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:32.299
So Shastriji asked, “What is sovereignty?”

00:03:32.314 --> 00:03:36.219
“That we don’t know. We
want our sovereignty.”

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.426
“Then, what is sovereignty you want?”

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:44.888
Then they said, “This is what
we have. We know one thing.”

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:50.368
Then they said, “But what is it? That we
don’t know.”  “But why do you want it?”

00:03:50.368 --> 00:03:54.328
“That we don’t know.  We
want our sovereignty.”

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.820
To the Prime Minister! The Prime Minister
said, “Oh God, these Christians.”

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.710
And they were wearing suits and hats, funny hats
and suits and all Western dresses, you see.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.727
And they are all Christians in
Nagaland. And all stupid people.

00:04:11.342 --> 00:04:18.047
This is what they had got it, you see on a
paper. “We want our sovereignty.”  Finished.

00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:21.128
He could have given them anything.

00:04:22.438 --> 00:04:29.104
I was thinking, he should have given them some sort of an
odd paper and said, “This is sovereignty, you take it back.”

00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:31.415
They would have taken it.

00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:38.645
Such things they have got. And it’s created a
problem; this Nagaland is a problem for India now.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.565
It’s the missionaries who have created.

00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:42.880
Yes, the missionaries.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.850
(in Marathi) They wrote it down in their language, “You
go and meet Shastriji and when you go there tell him,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.350
we want our sovereignty, finished.”

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.850
But Shastriji was non-plussed. He said,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.350
(in Marathi) “Then what next?”

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.230
And in English, you see,
"We want our sovereignty.”

00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:02.920
(in Marathi) “Why do you want
it, sir?” “That we do not know.

00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:05.454
We want our sovereignty.”

00:05:06.914 --> 00:05:10.514
I tell you. When Shashtriji told
us, I didn’t know where to look.

00:05:10.514 --> 00:05:15.503
He said, “But this is too much. Just written
down that word in English, I mean this sentence

00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:20.678
and they were reading it out to me all the time. They would
not say what is sovereignty, why sovereignty – nothing.”

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.949
Now missionaries, these then educated.

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:29.369
Now the idea of missionaries – because
Church is always confused with...

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:36.349
I mean the ruling people, like the kings and queens and also politics –

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.643
so now they are confused with that.

00:05:38.643 --> 00:05:41.990
So they want to create
a Christian land there.

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:46.240
As it is, we have one Hindu
land, one Muslim land.

00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:51.788
Then we have one Sikh land. Then we’ll have one
Christian land. And there’s one Bangla land.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.544
So I don’t know how many parts of that country there
are going to be, of according to the religion.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:06:00.196
And nobody follows it, that’s the best part of it.

00:06:02.387 --> 00:06:06.636
And if you see, I saw the other day when
our Prime Minister went to Nagaland,

00:06:06.645 --> 00:06:10.027
they made him wear a hat
and he was dancing there.

00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:12.514
You wear a hat according to them it's Christian.

00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:17.047
You see, many Christians in India
believe that Christ was born in England.

00:06:20.517 --> 00:06:22.567
And that he was himself a Christian.

00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:23.677
He himself...  er?

00:06:23.677 --> 00:06:24.987
that he was a Christian.

00:06:25.027 --> 00:06:28.597
Yes. He Himself was a Christian
and was born in England.

00:06:28.637 --> 00:06:31.417
This they believe, actually
they believe in it.

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:39.096
See there is a story, an interesting story of a villager who
was living… he used to come to Allahabad from his village.

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.601
And he became a Christian.

00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:45.126
So he would always go to the river
Ganges, have a bath and go back.

00:06:45.158 --> 00:06:52.435
So the priest told them, “Now you can’t do, you
see, your religion has changed, you cannot do that.

00:06:52.473 --> 00:06:54.973
Now you have become a Christian.
You can’t go to the river.”

00:06:54.973 --> 00:06:59.450
River Ganges, the Christians
don’t go in India, do you know?

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.680
They don’t go to the river Ganges.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.680
So, he said in his own language, “Sir, I have become
a ‘sahib’,” means, I have become an Englishman.

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:11.189
“But I cannot give up my religion.”

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:15.399
He thought he had become a sahib.

00:07:25.558 --> 00:07:30.223
And the names are also, they will
change it like this you see. Like a......

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:35.553
like this gentleman’s name was Blondie. So ‘bhura’ (blond) means ‘bhura’.

00:07:35.553 --> 00:07:38.053
So he said, “Give me a good
name, like Alexander’s name.”

00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:42.694
So they called him
Alexander Bhura, you see.

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:48.574
So his name was Alexander Bhura, so he thought
he had become a sahib you see, an Englishman.

00:07:48.594 --> 00:07:56.895
“And now they are asking me to give up my religion also, is
too much. I can’t give up my religion. I will go to Gangaji.”

00:07:58.435 --> 00:08:01.780
It’s very sad though, what
the missionaries did.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:15.104
I know in Hawaii and places like that, they destroyed what, from what I’ve read, appears to have been a very enlightened religion,

00:08:15.104 --> 00:08:20.669
which would have allowed, for
instance, Sahaja Yoga to just…

00:08:20.684 --> 00:08:22.689
they would have understood it instantly.

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:25.189
And the Christians just chopped it off.

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:33.912
In one generation. Of course the things that Cortez
did in Central America; terrible. Every.....

00:08:33.952 --> 00:08:34.893
Horrible things…

00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:41.803
Every book that had ever been… held any
knowledge that the Aztec came was destroyed.

00:08:41.824 --> 00:08:44.915
I mean, there is a history
behind the whole thing

00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:48.985
Thank God Columbus missed
his point, went to America.

00:08:48.988 --> 00:08:53.508
Otherwise, there would have
been no Sahaja Yoga here.

00:08:53.528 --> 00:08:58.070
There would be all Americans
roaming around in India, I think.

00:08:58.088 --> 00:09:09.565
With their AIDS, or with that kind of a trouble that
they have, because that would have been the thing.

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:21.022
I think Hanumana must have done
that job, to take Columbus away.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:30.909
Because I can’t understand. This fellow, such
a clever man, went all the way from England.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.107
I mean from… Columbus was from Portuguese, was he?

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:41.061
From Portugal, he went to a place –
Spanish, he was Spanish, I think: Spanish.

00:09:41.073 --> 00:09:46.683
He should have gone to India, I don’t
know how he reached America, you see.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.211
So must be Hanumana’s trick.

00:09:51.619 --> 00:09:53.313
That’s a long way.

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:55.829
That’s what, he was there. But
they killed all the people.

00:09:57.064 --> 00:10:00.069
He did call that continent India.

00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:01.729
Yes they killed....

00:10:01.729 --> 00:10:02.829
That’s why we have the Red Indians.

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:07.439
Yes. Red Indians. But the poor Red Indians
were killed and massacred completely.

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:11.947
I mean the white people wherever they
went, they massacred all kinds.

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.477
You see, the French, the
Portuguese… I tell you,

00:10:14.477 --> 00:10:17.217
the Portuguese now they look so horrid.

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:24.107
But when they came to India – near Bombay,
you must have seen that Trimurti and all that.

00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:26.602
Did you go to see that Trimurti?

00:10:26.602 --> 00:10:30.173
That’s such a rock, black rock.

00:10:30.187 --> 00:10:35.858
And to hewn into it with this beauty
was really… must have been remarkable.

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:38.908
But these people thought this rock
cannot be broken with anything,

00:10:38.908 --> 00:10:42.768
so they took cannons on
the ship and blasted it.

00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:50.671
That is such a strong rock that even now if you
have to nail them, you cannot put a drill on that.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:54.851
So, such a strong rock it is. And they
made such beautiful designs and things.

00:10:54.851 --> 00:11:00.340
But they blasted it. They were so much
against all these things, these Portuguese.

00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:07.035
So many temples, beautiful
temples they demolished.

00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:13.455
And the English also, terrible the English
were. English killed so many people in Calcutta.

00:11:13.455 --> 00:11:20.007
In a hole, they put them in a hole, known as
‘Hole of Calcutta’. And so many people were killed.

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:20.705
Black hole of Calcutta.

00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:24.955
Black hole of Calcutta. And in Dhaka…

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.460
Jallianwala Bagh,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.180
Jallianwala Bagh, another thing.
Just killed people just like that.

00:11:30.979 --> 00:11:32.640
In 1942.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.140
1942 yes, I was there.

00:11:36.319 --> 00:11:37.519
They put...

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:41.169
Yes, yes. They troubled
Me and tortured Me.

00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:47.069
They put Me on ice and all, they gave Me
electric shocks.  All of them know all about it.

00:11:50.424 --> 00:11:54.874
Horrible. They think they have a
right, you see to possess somebody.

00:11:54.874 --> 00:11:58.624
This is plundering, this is plundering. Go
to somebody’s country, take away everything,

00:11:58.641 --> 00:12:02.304
plunder that person
and become the king?

00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:07.244
Pirates, I tell you

00:12:16.654 --> 00:12:19.154
Terrible thing they have done.

00:12:19.154 --> 00:12:28.309
But this killing people! Now, in Dhaka, there were
people who used to make beautiful ‘malmal’ , you see.

00:12:28.328 --> 00:12:30.828
A kind of a very thin cloth.

00:12:30.828 --> 00:12:33.328
Very beautiful cloth.

00:12:33.328 --> 00:12:36.759
So thin, they used to develop the nails.

00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:41.339
And in there was a little hole they used to
make. And out of that, they used to take out.

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:53.620
It was a wonderful thing that one whole dhoti
could be put into a small little shell of a …

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.590
Walnut. Walnut

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.090
Walnut.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.390
The whole dhoti could
be put inside a walnut.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:12.974
And they killed them. All of them, they cut
their thumbs you see, they cut their thumbs.

00:13:12.994 --> 00:13:15.494
So jealous.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.754
Because the mills of Manchester
sell that cloth there.

00:13:19.844 --> 00:13:24.246
I mean, you cannot compete with
Manchester, because that was…this thing.

00:13:24.246 --> 00:13:30.586
But just an idea. It’s not that… you see, all of them. It's not English, the French, wherever they went, horrible.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:33.852
French have ruined so many people.

00:13:33.852 --> 00:13:38.772
Now, this Sierra Leone
where these people went.

00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:48.007
Actually, there are Australians working, but there
are the people who are there, are French, I think.

00:13:48.017 --> 00:13:53.397
The people who are ruling that place is
French. They are so cruel to these people,

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.930
that they have taken to Sahaja Yoga now.

00:13:58.578 --> 00:14:01.078
They’re extremely cruel.

00:14:01.078 --> 00:14:03.578
It’s there all the way
through that part of Africa.

00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:09.968
Portuguese were such
cruel people I tell you.

00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:14.168
Horrible.  Now they have become very poor.

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:22.419
But all this white skin had that idea of aggressing
others, of plundering others, and sort of ruling everyone.

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:24.299
Spanish.

00:14:24.299 --> 00:14:29.039
Spaniards are also bad. The whole of
America is covered by these Spaniards.

00:14:30.212 --> 00:14:32.712
I mean, they didn’t kill us so
much, the English, I must say,

00:14:32.712 --> 00:14:37.198
the way they were killed by these
Spaniards for no reason at all.

00:14:38.942 --> 00:14:41.442
I went to this Rio de Janeiro,

00:14:41.442 --> 00:14:43.942
and I wanted to see one aboriginal.

00:14:43.942 --> 00:14:46.152
One person was living there.

00:14:46.162 --> 00:14:49.452
They said, “We don’t have. You
can go in the museum and see.”

00:14:49.494 --> 00:14:53.212
But not one single person left by these Spaniards' group.

00:14:53.212 --> 00:14:56.474
Now did you see the condition
of the Spanish, where are they?

00:14:57.802 --> 00:15:03.122
In Brazil, Mother they still have...

00:15:03.117 --> 00:15:14.701
it seems almost awful to say it, but they still have hunting parties where you can pay to go on a hunting party to shoot Indians.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.951
Shoot an Indian?

00:15:20.951 --> 00:15:27.351
And the reason is money again, because they want to get them out of the forests so that they can go in and take the land.

00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:30.871
So they have safaris.

00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:40.118
And you know who, the
nation that goes the most?

00:15:40.168 --> 00:15:41.698
The Germans.

00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.446
Oh!

00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:53.426
Germans are very cunning. Now
they are all settled down there.

00:15:53.457 --> 00:16:01.823
This Argentina – that was the only time
I was happy that Argentina was defeated.

00:16:01.823 --> 00:16:04.113
Because all the Germans are there.

00:16:04.113 --> 00:16:07.683
They are teaching them all these things.
They are the ones who started the war.

00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:14.135
When I went to Argentina, we went for a navy parade

00:16:14.152 --> 00:16:20.877
and I was surprised they were having those steps,
you see, goose steps they call them, like that.

00:16:20.905 --> 00:16:25.945
I said, I told My husband, “How are they
having goose steps, these Argentineans?”

00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:29.429
He was also surprised you see
because these only Germans do.

00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:34.300
So when we asked them, they were shocked and
they said, “We have some German teachers.”

00:16:34.312 --> 00:16:39.679
But all Germans who have run away from
the wartime are settled in Argentina.

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:42.179
And they had big arrangements
to destroy the whole world.

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:47.019
So this has shattered; that’s the only point where
the British have done something very sensible.

00:16:47.015 --> 00:16:53.081
Maybe I was in England –   very great –
that they have finished those Germans.

00:16:53.081 --> 00:16:55.581
Though it has caused them a
lot of problems, no doubt.

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:59.525
But that was a sensible thing to do.
Because so many Germans have ruined

00:16:59.573 --> 00:17:02.073
– already building all kinds of things there.

00:17:04.203 --> 00:17:08.133
In Paraguay, just north of there
too, there’s a lot of Germans.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.130
But then the war between themselves.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.810
Look at that.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.860
Then the Germans start fighting them.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.590
Germans didn’t go out, you
see, that is the thing is.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:28.640
Germans did not fight the people outside
Europe or outside their territories.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:36.540
What they wanted to fight is the English, the
Russians, all those people who are Europeans, there.

00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.517
Polish.

00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:41.417
So they started fight among themselves.

00:17:41.433 --> 00:17:46.477
You see, violence is such that if you start
doing violence to anyone, it comes back to you.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.697
And among yourselves, you start fighting.

00:17:50.097 --> 00:17:52.597
And even now, Germans you cannot say.

00:17:52.597 --> 00:17:55.781
They are like sleeping tigers.

00:17:55.796 --> 00:18:00.761
I went to Germany Myself – West Germany
is all right, but East Germany I went to.

00:18:00.761 --> 00:18:07.987
It’s like a… you feel like dead
cemeteries are everywhere.

00:18:08.005 --> 00:18:13.007
But also through them, you feel there’s
a big violence building, even now.

00:18:13.027 --> 00:18:18.801
They’re very hot-tempered, violent people.

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:25.641
You feel as if you have come into some hothouse.

00:18:25.661 --> 00:18:29.611
Only once I went and I told C.P. I am not
going to come back again to this country:

00:18:30.298 --> 00:18:32.798
East Germany. Horrible!

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.698
Even now the people are so hot-tempered.

00:18:39.738 --> 00:18:44.305
Today if you… I tell you Russians
what they are doing it’s… thank God.

00:18:44.338 --> 00:18:48.434
If you allow them to come up, they
can destroy the whole world.

00:18:48.436 --> 00:18:50.174
They will try again too…

00:18:50.174 --> 00:18:54.367
Hitler could be born only in Germany. No other place.

00:18:55.454 --> 00:18:56.365
Really!

00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.385
And there are many who worship Hitler even now.

00:18:59.385 --> 00:19:05.532
Many. In East Germany, everyone. They
just say it was a political mistake.

00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:07.402
That he attacked Russia?

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.982
Same mistake as Napoleon made.

00:19:13.992 --> 00:19:20.037
Yes, That’s what is the play. Krishna Leela is there.

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:29.068
But Germans – I mean they are the cruellest, I think.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.920
No, the cruellest are the Japanese.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:42.196
You can’t say because what I heard
about them in Warsaw, Warsaw.

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:53.072
They are so mean and so low-level. They took out the
fats of the people and used them for soap making.

00:19:54.766 --> 00:19:56.602
That was in Hitler’s time.

00:19:56.602 --> 00:19:58.339
Hitler’s time I am saying – Warsaw.

00:19:58.374 --> 00:20:00.874
They made lampshades out
of their skin, Mother.

00:20:02.194 --> 00:20:04.694
They used the skin.

00:20:05.444 --> 00:20:07.944
And Jews are no less now.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.800
Jews, they have picked up everything from Germans.

00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:14.685
And the way they are now
torturing Palestinians.

00:20:16.405 --> 00:20:18.905
Oh God, that’s also terrible.

00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:21.875
They are taking the vengeance.

00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:25.431
They were tortured at the hands of Hitler.

00:20:25.544 --> 00:20:30.521
Now they are taking revenge from the Lebanese.

00:20:31.318 --> 00:20:36.792
I don’t know it’s a revenge or a
kind of a thing what they saw in the war.

00:20:36.805 --> 00:20:42.852
They became experts and they thought we must practise
now on Palestinians all those wretched things;

00:20:42.877 --> 00:20:46.586
whatever they have gone through.

00:20:46.615 --> 00:20:49.856
There’s a lot of subtle things
that came out of Hitler.

00:20:49.888 --> 00:20:56.086
Even though I know I shouldn’t,
every time I see the Swastika, I get…

00:20:56.112 --> 00:20:58.136
You get a fright.

00:20:58.136 --> 00:21:00.116
You see, that is the lucky point.

00:21:00.111 --> 00:21:03.656
What happened in Swastika,
Swastika is two ways.

00:21:03.665 --> 00:21:09.086
One way is for construction, another
is for destruction: another side.

00:21:09.123 --> 00:21:12.483
What happened, the trick of
the trade was like this;

00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:17.463
they were using stencils to make the Swastika.

00:21:17.491 --> 00:21:24.441
And then they… one side they used and when they started
using the other side, it came out to be the other way round.

00:21:24.487 --> 00:21:25.681
The wrong way.

00:21:25.681 --> 00:21:28.181
It’s Swastika that defeated them.

00:21:31.351 --> 00:21:34.788
(in Marathi): Swastika has two emblems. One
is constructive, the other is destructive.

00:21:34.818 --> 00:21:39.748
If it is like this then it is constructive,
the opposite way is destructive.

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:46.280
They were using stencils. When it got damaged
on one side, they started using the other side.

00:21:46.309 --> 00:21:51.539
When I saw them upside down, I said,
“Now finished. Now they are all right.”

00:21:53.204 --> 00:21:55.704
Hitler himself started
wearing upside-down thing.

00:22:07.734 --> 00:22:12.783
And as he says, Japanese –
another. Another of this thing.

00:22:12.822 --> 00:22:17.173
I was telling him the reason, because
in Japan, the mother is not respected.

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.349
Mother is just a dishwasher.

00:22:19.347 --> 00:22:26.529
And the other women are geishas or dishwashers,
or, what you call them, career girls.

00:22:26.529 --> 00:22:29.029
And the wives are dishwashers.

00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:34.449
So the mother is always ill-treated, she is given
food outside, she doesn’t eat with the family;

00:22:34.489 --> 00:22:36.989
she’s treated just like a servant all the time.

00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:40.137
She has to take out the shoes of
the husband, and she has to...

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:46.339
I mean, do everything that a
maidservant has to do in the house.

00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:52.311
So the children who see their mother being treated like
this develop that thing within themselves, that anger.

00:22:52.311 --> 00:22:54.811
That’s why they are very angry people.

00:22:54.811 --> 00:22:59.558
And the good-looking women
and career women never marry.

00:22:59.602 --> 00:23:03.934
They never marry. And they never have children.

00:23:03.937 --> 00:23:05.667
Because of this treatment?

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:11.587
And the…If there is a very rich man, then he has
to pay a lot of money to marry a beautiful woman.

00:23:11.595 --> 00:23:14.887
Then he marries her. But he goes to geisha house.

00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:18.774
They will never take you to their houses, their homes.

00:23:19.918 --> 00:23:27.294
If you see their women, their hands are like, just like washerwomen, you see, very rough and thick.

00:23:27.294 --> 00:23:32.768
They sleep on the ground separately,
treated just like servants.

00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:37.994
And they didn’t open their gates
for ages to any other country.

00:23:37.994 --> 00:23:39.987
They lived with all that nonsense.

00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:42.837
But Chinese are different. Chinese are like us.

00:23:42.858 --> 00:23:51.473
Their whole system is like us, their styles are like
us, their whole morality sense is like us and also,

00:23:51.483 --> 00:23:55.133
they are very wise people.  Very wise.

00:24:01.068 --> 00:24:04.346
See we have had another
problem I feel that way,

00:24:04.378 --> 00:24:09.176
that our Prime Ministers have been
all, you see Western-oriented:

00:24:09.192 --> 00:24:14.814
educated in the Western countries, except for Shastriji.

00:24:14.913 --> 00:24:18.704
You see Balsar, this is the difference.

00:24:19.644 --> 00:24:22.724
They never understood the value of our country.

00:24:25.054 --> 00:24:28.368
More impressed by Western people.

00:24:28.374 --> 00:24:31.358
Westernised people. Even this one.

00:24:31.393 --> 00:24:33.893
He likes people who can speak
good English.

00:24:36.611 --> 00:24:39.111
Even Rajiv Gandhi.

00:24:39.141 --> 00:24:42.821
If they are Italians he likes them
more, because his wife is Italian.

00:24:42.855 --> 00:24:51.712
I don’t know if he cares for that or not, but he
has very much inclination to a Westernised life.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.392
Not that kind, but still.

00:24:55.392 --> 00:24:59.792
That is one of the reasons, you see.
They are not children of the soil.

00:24:59.792 --> 00:25:05.554
Except for Lal Bahadur Shastri, if he had lived,
we would have been a different country you see.

00:25:05.554 --> 00:25:09.282
All dishonesty had vanished from
India, all corruption had vanished.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.922
He was a very honest man.
Wonderful things were happening.

00:25:13.857 --> 00:25:19.502
Corruption has come in. Honesty has
vanished and corruption has come in.

00:25:20.152 --> 00:25:23.103
It has been impacted.

00:25:23.137 --> 00:25:27.633
I think honesty is the one that opens the door
and lets corruption in though, isn’t it?

00:25:27.653 --> 00:25:28.443
That’s right.

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:35.423
You don’t expect people to be other than
honest; they open the door and in they come.

00:25:35.437 --> 00:25:38.557
It is kind of a habit formation.

00:25:38.587 --> 00:25:43.507
You see, get into the habit of getting money this way,
that way – then you start doing that all the time.

00:25:43.507 --> 00:25:45.187
I think that must be the reason.

00:25:45.202 --> 00:25:53.262
Because I have known people who were very good. Suddenly they become like that and they start grabbing this, grabbing that, grabbing that; there is no limit to things.

00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:55.805
There should be certain maryadas for everything.

00:26:01.877 --> 00:26:05.764
Yes, I find in Western societies,
maryadas is a thing that doesn’t exist.

00:26:05.802 --> 00:26:08.302
Doesn’t exist in anything. In anything!

00:26:11.812 --> 00:26:13.537
It did.

00:26:14.127 --> 00:26:17.757
It did. It did have. I mean,
they were reaching that point.

00:26:17.756 --> 00:26:26.496
But before they could reach the Absolute, they
just got into this problem, of materialism.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:35.890
How can you, see be a free person if you don’t respect
the freedom of another person? Maryada means that.

00:26:35.895 --> 00:26:39.354
To respect the freedom of another person is maryadas.

00:26:39.395 --> 00:26:46.552
And those maryadas one must have. Because of that,
you do not respect the freedom of another person.

00:26:46.582 --> 00:26:49.082
You are aggressing each other all the time.

00:26:49.082 --> 00:26:52.582
Whenever he has the chance, he will
aggress you or you will aggress him.

00:26:52.582 --> 00:26:55.082
So it will go on like that, you see.

00:26:55.082 --> 00:27:00.712
But if you respect the freedom of another
person, this is freedom and this is my freedom.

00:27:00.755 --> 00:27:03.255
Then a maryada is put in there.

00:27:04.215 --> 00:27:07.955
Then I suppose maryada means what
Christ said, “Do unto others…”

00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.685
As you want to be done to yourself.

00:27:10.687 --> 00:27:13.187
Don’t hate.

00:27:13.187 --> 00:27:17.337
But you see, they say that,
“Why? Why should we do that?”

00:27:17.381 --> 00:27:25.307
In England or in America or any of these places you
go to. You tell them, you should do. “But why?”

00:27:27.216 --> 00:27:29.716
But Christ has said it. “Who is Christ?”

00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:32.478
In America, they say. England,
they may not say so.

00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:41.300
But America, they say, “Who is Christ?  Why
should we listen to?  Who is to tell us?”

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.800
Abraham Lincoln is nothing for them.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.980
You know there is only little
Lincoln Road somewhere far away.

00:27:48.986 --> 00:27:52.000
They don’t regard him as anything great.

00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:55.106
So what to do?

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:59.361
They have a story about that also. An
American and a Russian were talking.

00:28:00.588 --> 00:28:05.640
The American said that, “We
have such freedom in America

00:28:05.674 --> 00:28:12.594
that I can stand before the White House, the
President’s house and say that our President is a fool.”

00:28:12.639 --> 00:28:16.314
The Russian said, “I also can do that.”

00:28:16.349 --> 00:28:18.849
He said, “Really, is that so?”

00:28:18.849 --> 00:28:23.869
He said, “Yes, I can stand before your
President’s house and say that he is a fool.”

00:28:34.377 --> 00:28:39.097
But what I was telling him that, say in
Russia,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:45.657
restricted life is given to them. But no maryadas.
They don’t have maryadas, it’s only restricted life.

00:28:45.683 --> 00:28:51.781
Now they are starting some sort
of a curtailing on drinking, say.

00:28:51.831 --> 00:28:54.331
Now that will go on. But there is…

00:28:54.331 --> 00:29:00.958
It’s just by force, you see. Maryadas are
your own, ingrained.  It’s the culture.

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:05.023
So once they get out of that
place then they drink like hell.

00:29:05.023 --> 00:29:09.370
Not that they’ve accepted
from within, those things

00:29:09.413 --> 00:29:13.640
that they are accepting these virtues
as a part and parcel of their being.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.140
It’s just a force on them. So they are doing it.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.980
But that day when they are
doing it, then they are Sahaj.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.750
Sahaj, in a Sahaj way!  Maryadas
come to you in a Sahaj way.

00:29:40.034 --> 00:29:42.999
It’s like tabla. Tabla.

00:29:42.999 --> 00:29:45.499
Like tabla – it has to have a rhythm.

00:29:47.001 --> 00:29:49.501
It cannot go on flowing with it.

00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:55.311
You cannot just start it and go into any rhythm
or anything. You have to keep to that maryada.

00:29:55.331 --> 00:30:00.445
In everything in life, there is maryada.

00:30:00.485 --> 00:30:02.985
Otherwise, you wouldn’t know where you stand.

00:30:02.985 --> 00:30:07.975
I mean, the sea also has a maryada.

00:30:07.982 --> 00:30:10.482
The ocean has such a maryada

00:30:10.482 --> 00:30:16.916
that supposing you try to press the sea on one side
of the harbour, it will come out in some other part.

00:30:19.959 --> 00:30:21.911
It starts showing in some other part.

00:30:21.934 --> 00:30:23.601
But not beyond that.

00:30:23.644 --> 00:30:24.824
Not beyond.

00:30:24.824 --> 00:30:27.324
Supposing you try to raise the ...

00:30:27.324 --> 00:30:36.954
in Bombay they have done it, you see. They have raised
Bombay in these areas like say, Marine Drive and all that.

00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:40.225
It has shown in other places.

00:30:45.809 --> 00:30:50.269
In Versova, the sea has entered the land.

00:30:50.284 --> 00:30:52.784
It keeps to its maryadas.

00:30:56.079 --> 00:31:00.484
And it is such an uncertain society.

00:31:00.502 --> 00:31:05.414
If you don’t have maryadas, you don’t
know how you stand with another person.

00:31:05.417 --> 00:31:08.714
You cannot find out your relationships
with each other, you see.

00:31:08.714 --> 00:31:12.478
You cannot understand how far
you can go with that person.

00:31:12.484 --> 00:31:17.408
It’s a very funny stuff, not to have maryadas.

00:31:19.397 --> 00:31:22.687
I suppose

00:31:22.697 --> 00:31:26.897
one of the problems in Western society
is that we have been taught to believe

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:33.174
that you can’t have maryadas, because if you want
to get on in this world in a business sense,

00:31:33.174 --> 00:31:38.150
you have to find some way of doing
something better than someone else,

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:42.103
which means that you have to tread on
them to get higher up on the ladder.

00:31:42.113 --> 00:31:45.603
But that can be done with maryadas also.

00:31:47.664 --> 00:31:52.092
You see, doing better than other means
what?  Must have maryadas, isn’t it.

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:57.167
Supposing there are two
persons who are doing business.

00:31:57.167 --> 00:32:04.802
One person tries to outwit another person by
false means or sort of, all kinds of other things.

00:32:04.824 --> 00:32:07.324
Luring him into something funny

00:32:07.324 --> 00:32:14.244
like taking him to women, then do this and do
that. All sorts of wrong things he takes to.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.760
How far will he go?

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:28.948
But a person who goes in his maryadas can transcend
everyone else, because he has kept his personality intact.

00:32:28.977 --> 00:32:33.218
He has not wasted it,
frittered away or made it cheap.

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:43.799
And the idea of doing better
is also money-oriented.

00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:46.814
But doing better in a general way is different.

00:32:46.859 --> 00:32:59.289
Like, I will tell you. Lal Bahadur Shastri was a man; when there was an accident, a railway accident in the South. He resigned.

00:32:59.329 --> 00:33:01.829
Means he was the Minister of Railways.

00:33:01.829 --> 00:33:06.769
He had nothing to do with that railway in
particular or anything, but he resigned.

00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:08.519
Just resigned.

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:12.976
“When I am the Railway Minister and if there is an
accident, I should not be the minister.” He just resigned.

00:33:14.346 --> 00:33:18.166
And everybody remembers it and tells
about it, “See now what he has done.”

00:33:18.188 --> 00:33:21.098
He had that maryadas.

00:33:21.118 --> 00:33:25.978
And there are many other railway ministers we have
had who made money, did all this and everything.

00:33:25.978 --> 00:33:31.408
People don’t want to take their names in the morning
time. “No God, no, don’t take their names in the morning.”

00:33:33.018 --> 00:33:35.518
I don’t think we’ve got too many
politicians who would do that.

00:33:35.518 --> 00:33:40.260
They would have fifty-four reasons as
to why it was someone else’s fault.

00:33:42.497 --> 00:33:47.126
Like Shivaji’s case, I will tell you one
thing. Shivaji was a man of great maryadas.

00:33:47.147 --> 00:33:57.276
Shivaji’s people once looted a big treasures of a
“subedar,” Kalyan subedar and his daughter-in-law.

00:33:57.276 --> 00:33:59.776
She was going and with her,
all her treasures were going.

00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:06.926
Very beautiful woman… and they brought her. And she came with her covering on her face, you see.

00:34:06.946 --> 00:34:07.706
Veil.

00:34:07.706 --> 00:34:09.726
Ah, veil.

00:34:09.743 --> 00:34:14.463
And she was presented to Shivaji.

00:34:15.855 --> 00:34:21.402
So Shivaji asked her that, “You open your veil.”

00:34:21.408 --> 00:34:23.908
She opened her veil.

00:34:23.908 --> 00:34:27.934
So, he said…he saluted
her and he said, “See now,

00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:34.514
if my mother was as beautiful as you are, I would
have been even more beautiful than you are.”

00:34:34.547 --> 00:34:38.083
What a beautiful thing to say!
You see, sisterly relationship.

00:34:38.135 --> 00:34:43.365
“If my mother was as beautiful as you are, I
would have been even more beautiful than you.”

00:34:43.393 --> 00:34:49.555
And he shouted at all his subedars and all that.
“Don’t do all such things. No insults to women.”

00:34:49.581 --> 00:34:55.076
And he sent her back with all the things
that she was carrying, plus his own…

00:34:55.132 --> 00:35:02.336
with his own army to leave, to be left up to the
place where she was… from where she had come.

00:35:02.336 --> 00:35:05.597
Man of such maryadas, you see.

00:35:05.606 --> 00:35:13.487
He never felt anything attractive or anything about her. He
just felt, “A sweet sister of mine, such a beautiful sister.

00:35:13.487 --> 00:35:18.636
If I was…if my mother was as beautiful as she
is, I would have been as beautiful as this.”

00:35:18.643 --> 00:35:23.339
Just a sisterly feeling, to
come to a man of maryadas.

00:35:23.404 --> 00:35:32.859
And he was forced to marry four times by his mother because you see, they had to do some sort of a pact with other people.

00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:35.070
So he had to marry four times.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:35.870
Imagine.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.950
He married four times because
mother asked him, but in maryadas.

00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:43.930
But when he saw such a beautiful
woman, he just told her.

00:35:46.893 --> 00:35:50.842
Always he spent his life
in the company of saints.

00:35:50.842 --> 00:35:53.602
Always.

00:35:53.622 --> 00:35:57.202
Such maryadas, you see; in a
saint also, there are maryadas.

00:35:58.118 --> 00:36:01.022
Like a saint, like Tukarama.

00:36:01.028 --> 00:36:06.260
He went and saw him, and he saw the condition he
was... Tukarama was in a very poor condition.

00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:15.734
So he brought a lot of ornaments and everything and gave
it to his wife and lots of food and all that in the house.

00:36:15.752 --> 00:36:23.422
So Tukarama came back and he told his wife that.
And Shivaji was hearing what Tukarama had to say.

00:36:23.422 --> 00:36:27.872
He said, “See, this is meant for
queens and kings, not for us.

00:36:27.893 --> 00:36:35.392
We are poor farmers, and it doesn’t behove for
a farmer to wear all these expensive things.

00:36:35.403 --> 00:36:38.192
So you better return all this to Shivaji.”

00:36:38.192 --> 00:36:40.692
Shivba, Shivba they used to call him Shivba.

00:36:40.692 --> 00:36:49.264
“But you see, whatever is suitable for your status, you wear
that. That will look nice on you, this you better give. ”

00:36:49.304 --> 00:36:58.624
And he was surprised. But Shivaji was there. He
came and fell at his feet, so he gave...

00:37:02.545 --> 00:37:06.540
Excuse me Shri Mataji, I think
Your dinner would be ready soon.

00:37:08.828 --> 00:37:10.670
What time we have to go?

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.170
It’s about ten minutes drive
Mother, just down the street.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.890
And what time is the program?

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.170
Programme is for seven-thirty…

00:37:18.212 --> 00:37:19.270
Seven-thirty.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.370
so we will be there from seven o clock, maybe…

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:27.510
So if you think proper, I’ll come back and have
dinner, because I am really not at all hungry. Alright?

00:37:27.546 --> 00:37:30.046
I’ll have some tea, that’s all.

00:37:30.046 --> 00:37:34.376
There is a note from… you know a K.C. Meddapa?

00:37:34.579 --> 00:37:35.129
Auh?

00:37:35.129 --> 00:37:40.929
K.C. Madappa? From India. K.C…

00:37:41.609 --> 00:37:43.359
Madappa.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:51.809
Well, his sister is here, Mother. Sister’s
name is Daya. She wishes an audience with you.

00:37:51.844 --> 00:37:54.344
She’s a doctor.

00:37:54.344 --> 00:37:56.844
She says that you know this K.C.

00:37:56.855 --> 00:37:58.575
Of course!

00:37:58.575 --> 00:38:04.325
We didn’t know whether it was someone that was
just saying that they knew You when they didn’t.

00:38:06.185 --> 00:38:11.591
Madappa. Madappa was
secretary of Sanjeeva Reddy.

00:38:12.551 --> 00:38:16.751
He has seen Me curing Sanjeeva
Reddy and also curing so many people.

00:38:16.796 --> 00:38:21.496
Madappa. A friend of C.P.
Oh, I would love to see him.

00:38:21.535 --> 00:38:23.494
Actually it’s his sister.

00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:26.235
His sister, yes.

00:38:26.259 --> 00:38:29.709
Yes, Doctor Ganapati,
who is the sister of K.C.

00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:32.219
So when would she like to see Me?

00:38:32.219 --> 00:38:34.459
Well, we have a telephone
number here, we could ring her.

00:38:34.459 --> 00:38:44.399
And whenever she is free, ask her. Whenever she
is free. See, tomorrow is a programme, isn’t it?

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:47.570
Tomorrow night, but tomorrow is free – tomorrow day.

00:38:48.782 --> 00:38:50.342
Sorry! It’s eleven o’clock, is it?

00:38:50.382 --> 00:38:51.982
Eleven o’clock what?

00:38:51.982 --> 00:38:54.212
There’s a newspaper man…

00:38:54.212 --> 00:39:00.782
A person coming, eleven o’clock. Then, before that?

00:39:00.815 --> 00:39:03.462
How about after two?

00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:11.089
Or we can have it about... before the programme
tomorrow? Day after we are going, aren’t we?

00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:15.988
No wait. We are going on Friday,
so tomorrow is Wednesday.

00:39:16.038 --> 00:39:20.018
Then she can see Me on Thursday morning.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.540
Thursday morning.

00:39:22.896 --> 00:39:25.778
Thursday we will go out for shopping
a little bit, I was thinking.

00:39:25.798 --> 00:39:27.018
Ah, wonderful.

00:39:27.018 --> 00:39:30.089
Because I want to show
him also some things here.

00:39:30.128 --> 00:39:34.079
You make one thing, in that you get in Melbourne,
the same thing I was telling you about.

00:39:34.089 --> 00:39:35.429
Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:39:35.429 --> 00:39:42.577
That’s something you make. I have discovered
four/five things you make in Melbourne.

00:39:45.074 --> 00:39:48.737
And you wanted to see Kerry
too, Mother, sometime. Kerry?

00:39:48.737 --> 00:39:57.859
I want to see him also, Kerry also. I want to see him,
yes. So should we try on him after the programme, anytime.

00:39:57.865 --> 00:40:00.365
Thank you Shri Mataji.

00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:04.425
Day after tomorrow?  After the programme.

00:40:09.214 --> 00:40:11.714
There’s still time, a lot of time.

00:40:18.184 --> 00:40:23.290
I don’t know when this started –
taking money in the name of God.

00:40:24.536 --> 00:40:26.569
A long time ago I think, Mother.

00:40:26.586 --> 00:40:34.819
But Martin Luther, who was a realised
soul, he flouted Mister Pope completely.

00:40:34.808 --> 00:40:37.488
And he brought him to task.

00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:42.638
But then again these same people
have taken the same sort of a thing.

00:40:45.633 --> 00:40:49.910
I’ve often wondered whether Paul
used to take money on the side.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.680
I’ll bet he did. I am sure he did.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.780
Paul, Mother!

00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:58.201
I never cared for Mister Paul.

00:40:58.198 --> 00:41:01.121
And somebody bought a couple
of new horses or something.

00:41:01.148 --> 00:41:07.894
He must be. Must be. He was not connected with God, he must be. You see, he must have changed his role just to make money.

00:41:07.944 --> 00:41:09.807
Otherwise, why did he become Christian?

00:41:09.814 --> 00:41:14.367
That’s what I thought. There must
have been a reason for all this.

00:41:14.364 --> 00:41:19.157
But he was hanged later on you
know. He was hanged ultimately.

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:24.446
I’m sure he always had the latest horse Mother.

00:41:24.446 --> 00:41:27.890
Like you have the latest car, he
always had the newest horse, I’m sure.

00:41:27.888 --> 00:41:35.366
Latest car. But I must say one thing, that
people are also extremely, extremely stupid.

00:41:35.401 --> 00:41:36.146
‘They’re gullible’

00:41:36.146 --> 00:41:42.436
They get what they deserve. I went to Boston, I think, yes.

00:41:42.441 --> 00:41:49.611
And they asked Me a question, the TV
people, “How many Rolls Royces She has?”

00:41:49.635 --> 00:41:52.185
That time Rajneesh was on the top you see.

00:41:52.224 --> 00:41:57.234
So they said, “She has no Rolls Royces. She
takes no money."  He said, "We’re not interested.”

00:41:58.335 --> 00:42:00.835
It’s a business you see.

00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:09.247
But of course, Mother the television
industry itself is a business,

00:42:09.247 --> 00:42:16.577
and if they think there’s  no selling
property in whatever it is that they…

00:42:16.605 --> 00:42:17.075
Yes

00:42:17.075 --> 00:42:22.895
we offer them, then they don’t want to know,
because they are selling advertising space.

00:42:22.895 --> 00:42:25.105
That’s not their responsibility there.

00:42:25.105 --> 00:42:29.965
Television and all these things came on this
earth, you can see from the photographs;

00:42:30.003 --> 00:42:37.853
the whole electrical energy was manifested in
the brains of human beings for Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:40.788 --> 00:42:43.288
Even if they accept or not,

00:42:43.288 --> 00:42:47.558
they must know that it is for
Sahaja Yog, for spreading Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:47.558 --> 00:42:53.623
because Christ came, that time there were very few people, they could not spread Christianity, so well.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.933
They did all this mess out of it.

00:42:55.968 --> 00:42:58.468
But now there is television.

00:42:59.378 --> 00:43:05.573
They have been ringing all day today Mother, saying,
“We saw that lady on the television last week.

00:43:05.598 --> 00:43:08.773
When is She speaking in
Melbourne?”  Hundreds of them.

00:43:08.773 --> 00:43:11.273
Really?

00:43:11.273 --> 00:43:14.528
There’s one little television
programme it just keeps going.

00:43:14.528 --> 00:43:18.588
And it will be the same in Adelaide,
because they saw it there too.

00:43:18.586 --> 00:43:19.518
Same?

00:43:19.546 --> 00:43:25.619
Yes, they saw that programme all around Australia,
every capital city and a lot of smaller cities.

00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:31.169
There were telephone calls from Townsville,
right up in the north of Australia;

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:36.031
from Perth, from Adelaide, from Canberra.

00:43:36.049 --> 00:43:39.342
All these places saw You.

00:43:39.373 --> 00:43:47.337
And have you not had time to tell Mother
the incredible story of the school….

00:43:49.597 --> 00:43:54.070
Mother, I have something. I
go to a teacher’s college…

00:43:54.086 --> 00:43:54.630
Yes?

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:55.620
To learn how to be a teacher

00:43:55.646 --> 00:43:56.250
Yes?

00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:01.280
And one of the subjects we were doing
yesterday was Psychology in Education.

00:44:01.318 --> 00:44:08.559
So, one man, who is a psychologist for twenty-five
years, he is teaching us how to understand our students

00:44:08.591 --> 00:44:15.029
and his remedy for relaxing is to take one
bottle of alcohol at home and drink.

00:44:15.029 --> 00:44:17.529
That’s what he is teaching us at school.

00:44:19.519 --> 00:44:26.079
Anyway, yesterday I had some of your posters
to do at the school, to put up at the school

00:44:26.099 --> 00:44:28.389
and I was sitting there for two hours.

00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:39.028
We were talking about what is intellect, how
good the ego is, and how to enhance the ego.

00:44:39.028 --> 00:44:41.528
The ego must take you on.

00:44:41.528 --> 00:44:46.848
So I was sort of going [Yogi gestures
something] sleeping like this

00:44:46.889 --> 00:44:52.387
and there was one other girl in the class. A very
simple girl from up the country and she said,

00:44:52.387 --> 00:45:07.650
"Excuse me Mr Sullivan, is what you're talking about ego? Is this sort of left side, female, past and right side male, future action?

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:14.947
And sort of Ego and, well Ego and
Superego or somewhere up there?”

00:45:14.979 --> 00:45:17.530
And I listened and it was Sahaj
she was speaking.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:24.150
And the psychologist said, “No, no, no
that’s all wrong. That’s all wrong.

00:45:24.143 --> 00:45:34.921
Erm, from the left side, we learn how to write and from the right side, we learn how to read. That’s what you’re talking about.” finished.

00:45:34.934 --> 00:45:42.938
So I went to her after and I said, “Do you want to know
about the left side and the desire, the pure desire of God,

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:50.010
and the pure action of God and how we can do this, and the balance and the centre channel?” She said, “Yes. Do you know about that?”

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:55.701
I said, “Yes, I do. I have it here.”
And I showed her one of Your pictures.

00:45:55.721 --> 00:46:00.714
And she said, “That’s Her. That’s
the Lady there. That’s the Lady.”

00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:05.175
And I said, “Where did you see Her?”
And she said, “On television.”

00:46:05.205 --> 00:46:09.067
And she’s coming tonight and tomorrow night.

00:46:09.095 --> 00:46:13.337
That must be… well we know there are
millions of people watched that programme.

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:17.435
Charles told Me now, “So many have seen
You Mother. That’s the biggest thing

00:46:17.435 --> 00:46:23.615
they have seen You, that’s the biggest thing. So
happy with this idea, that they have seen You.”

00:46:25.305 --> 00:46:29.465
What a wonderful thing television
will be, as you say, for Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:29.479 --> 00:46:36.314
When we can get time, we don’t have to fight
our way in, because it’s so much easier.

00:46:36.334 --> 00:46:37.804
It just goes straight out.

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:41.641
Even loudspeaker you will be
surprised is of such a help.

00:46:41.637 --> 00:46:49.171
You see, what had happened, I used to speak and Raolbai told Me that she sees vibrations, “going from this, Mother.”

00:46:49.193 --> 00:46:52.746
I said, “Really?”  She said, “Yes, they go into this.”

00:46:52.744 --> 00:46:58.456
“So then let’s try one thing.”  Then
I started blowing into it. That works.

00:47:02.326 --> 00:47:07.575
That means whenever I speak also it opens out.

00:47:12.785 --> 00:47:18.180
This television man got it afterwards but I don’t
know if he is going to announce that or say that.

00:47:18.224 --> 00:47:20.724
He wants to see me when I go back to Sydney.

00:47:20.724 --> 00:47:28.099
He asked me out to lunch but I couldn’t go because I
had to come here. But I know he wants to talk about it.

00:47:28.807 --> 00:47:39.250
Maybe we could get him for Ayers Rock – for Uluru, for Ganesha Puja in ‘88. Line it up for then. It would be wonderful.

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:46.970
Yes could be. Already your group
will be very big I think so.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.502
But this I told on the television, this
left and right? I must have said it.

00:47:56.524 --> 00:47:58.472
Yes, she said she heard it from You.

00:47:58.472 --> 00:48:00.972
In that short time.

00:48:02.842 --> 00:48:06.344
So at least the audience watching at home
was much better than the studio audience..

00:48:06.344 --> 00:48:12.234
They’re all loosely dressing up, all the time
looking after the dress and grinning at the thing.

00:48:12.262 --> 00:48:15.414
You see, I was watching them; they were very self-conscious.

00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:16.884
Oh yes!

00:48:16.919 --> 00:48:17.824
They knew the camera was on them.

00:48:17.824 --> 00:48:24.835
Ah, that’s it. So, they were not for this
programme at all. None of them were seekers.

00:48:27.425 --> 00:48:30.485
It’s quite funny Mother, with…

00:48:30.505 --> 00:48:34.245
Even with a microphone, if you
have somebody who talks a lot,

00:48:34.245 --> 00:48:36.295
they go, “la, la, la…” the whole time,

00:48:36.295 --> 00:48:40.995
you put the microphone in front of them and
they go, “Uhh…” and they can’t say a word.

00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:42.294
Because suddenly…

00:48:42.294 --> 00:48:44.081
(Marathi): You should go out and walk around.

00:48:44.081 --> 00:48:46.514
You can take him around a
little. Let him have a look.

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.030
(Marathi): After, I will rest for a while.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.171
(Marathi): All right. Take a rest.

00:48:50.171 --> 00:48:51.521
So?

00:48:52.505 --> 00:48:57.010
It is amazing how self-conscious they get the
moment you put a microphone in front of somebody

00:48:57.037 --> 00:49:03.910
or put a camera there in front of them and bang! They can
think of nothing else except, “Everybody’s looking at me!”

00:49:03.944 --> 00:49:04.610
Really?

00:49:04.654 --> 00:49:07.154
Yes, everything goes …

00:49:07.909 --> 00:49:12.074
Yes, that’s something. Self-consciousness.

00:49:19.334 --> 00:49:24.520
We have a saying which is, you don’t need to worry
about what other people are thinking about you.

00:49:24.535 --> 00:49:26.320
Because they are not thinking about you,

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.550
they’re worrying about what other
people are thinking about them.

00:49:32.575 --> 00:49:35.075
It’s the truth.

00:49:35.645 --> 00:49:38.145
Ah, it is very true.

00:49:39.326 --> 00:49:41.826
Rustom and these two have gone somewhere?

00:49:42.606 --> 00:49:44.366
(in Hindi): They are sleeping.

00:49:44.353 --> 00:49:47.986
They are sleeping? Both of them?

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.590
They never had their dinner or what?

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:55.179
We had biscuits and cheese
and tea and talk and…

00:49:55.189 --> 00:50:02.237
Then Rustom went for a walk and Rajesh Shah is asleep. The food was already… it was dished up and we had to take it back.

00:50:02.257 --> 00:50:06.127
They are tired, I think. Yeah?

00:50:08.001 --> 00:50:13.567
And everybody else now is outside at the
railway station giving out the handbills

00:50:13.584 --> 00:50:16.084
Handbills and all that, yes.

00:50:16.084 --> 00:50:18.190
It’s been very successful, the handbills, Mother.

00:50:18.183 --> 00:50:20.820
Handbills and also posters
are very successful.

00:50:20.833 --> 00:50:22.903
Very good, the handbills.

00:50:22.903 --> 00:50:30.341
But television is just for Me, nothing else. I mean, I can give
realisation on television to people, if they give Me at chance and time.

00:50:30.415 --> 00:50:34.898
But the way they, you see, just put you on the
seat and then you are out – jack in the box

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:40.165
they’ll just throw you out and then another
person comes and sits. It’s just impossible.

00:50:46.018 --> 00:50:49.218
Still it’s bringing a lot of people to Your programmes.

00:50:49.227 --> 00:50:53.008
Also Sahaja Yoga is a very sensible
thing itself. It works out.

00:50:53.044 --> 00:50:59.121
Like, as many as people you have, you see, it
will get the people that you can balance also.

00:50:59.146 --> 00:51:03.193
It goes on balancing. And it doesn’t
give you too much of a load also.

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:07.600
If you have too much of a
load, how will you manage them?

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.120
That’s right. This is one of the things
that I’ve always looked at with wonder

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:18.941
how, over the years here in Australia as we have grown,
so we have got a few more. But we never had too many.

00:51:18.953 --> 00:51:23.421
Too many, yes. You came to
Melbourne only first time, did you?

00:51:23.434 --> 00:51:25.934
Oh no, I was here before, the last time.

00:51:25.934 --> 00:51:30.060
No, no, no but when you got your
realisation, where did you get it?

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:36.560
You got it in Sydney. But in Melbourne,
lots of people came here in ’82, I think.

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:41.347
I think yes, they came down from…
the original lot came from Sydney.

00:51:41.372 --> 00:51:42.327
Oh, I see

00:51:42.327 --> 00:51:44.217
And then they transferred.

00:51:44.217 --> 00:51:46.717
Spread out, yes.

00:51:47.897 --> 00:51:49.970
That’s when I first met You, Mother.

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:51.390
You met Me here?

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:56.710
Yes. You came…that was my house that you came and
stopped in, in Essendon – the very first visit.

00:51:57.946 --> 00:52:00.804
The very first visit, there’s
a small wooden house there.

00:52:00.804 --> 00:52:03.366
Of course, I remember him very well.

00:52:03.383 --> 00:52:10.007
Because he came to receive us and he took us down to
his house, which was a small little house, I remember.

00:52:10.014 --> 00:52:15.247
Everything I remember very clearly, that part.

00:52:16.857 --> 00:52:22.714
But that time he was not listening
about Sahaja Yoga so much.

00:52:22.746 --> 00:52:26.602
I was pretty stupid then, Mataji.

00:52:26.646 --> 00:52:30.372
We tell some funny stories about that.

00:52:30.396 --> 00:52:37.908
But I got round him. I could see that
he’s a seeker but he’s lost his way.

00:52:37.908 --> 00:52:40.758
So I took a lot of interest in him.

00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:50.498
No, those who came first, always go wrong. Something
goes wrong with them, you see. Horrible they are.

00:52:50.513 --> 00:52:55.938
One better than the other. I mean
I don’t know how to address that.

00:52:55.975 --> 00:53:04.468
Everywhere it has happened. Even a
person like Gregoire has lost his head.

00:53:04.509 --> 00:53:08.145
That's surprised how it happens.

00:53:08.165 --> 00:53:15.575
He was quite shocked but then he realised,
he confessed it to Me, “Mother, it happens.”

00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:23.113
Brent and I were driving somewhere up North about three
weeks ago, and we were adding up the number of original…

00:53:23.113 --> 00:53:25.268
Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:25.293 --> 00:53:29.708
There weren’t many. We began to get worried.

00:53:29.718 --> 00:53:31.198
Yes, yes, it happens.

00:53:31.228 --> 00:53:37.618
It makes us very cautious: be careful.

00:53:38.292 --> 00:53:44.472
The…In London also, I gave realisation to some few before.

00:53:44.524 --> 00:53:47.422
I mean, the first batches that were.

00:53:47.444 --> 00:53:57.443
Gradually, surprisingly they became quite funny, and they
started an organisation called “The old Sahaja Yogis.”

00:53:58.903 --> 00:54:03.997
I didn’t know that. Suddenly I
found the behaviour rather funny.

00:54:04.026 --> 00:54:06.962
I said, “What is this going on?” They
said, “We are old Sahaja Yogis.”

00:54:07.002 --> 00:54:11.352
“Alright, better be seated now for your old age.”

00:54:19.102 --> 00:54:22.301
Because you see, all these are ideas.

00:54:22.312 --> 00:54:26.443
Some person who comes today might rise very fast.

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:32.172
Somebody who might have come from long
– you have seen it, what happened.

00:54:32.172 --> 00:54:34.672
Some people stay still, a lot.

00:54:34.672 --> 00:54:39.092
Quite a few, don’t they? You
talk about them and they...

00:54:39.122 --> 00:54:42.952
you think, well, I’ve been here five
years, six years whatever it is

00:54:42.952 --> 00:54:48.562
and that person’s exactly the same as when I first
met them– they haven’t changed one little bit.

00:54:48.572 --> 00:54:51.352
That’s it. So what do you say to that?

00:54:51.382 --> 00:54:55.136
And even if you pass ten
years you will be the same.

00:54:56.442 --> 00:55:01.172
So what is most important is
how far you grow, is the point.

00:55:01.195 --> 00:55:03.695
That growth is very important.

00:55:03.695 --> 00:55:08.563
And this leadership or anything,
whatever it is, is not so important.

00:55:08.593 --> 00:55:13.753
How far you grow. As soon as
you grow, your light will grow.

00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:27.370
And some people I have seen, have
come to Sahaja Yoga very, very late.

00:55:27.391 --> 00:55:30.690
They have shot up like anything.

00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:39.454
And some people who have been there... I mean, there are two brothers and sisters, like Nirmala’s brother and herself.

00:55:39.444 --> 00:55:41.944
There is a contrast I should say.

00:55:43.204 --> 00:55:45.704
Contrast. If you see the brother you will be amazed.

00:55:45.704 --> 00:55:48.072
I know  Prabakh and he is very good, Mother.

00:55:48.084 --> 00:55:50.584
He is tremendous. He is very deep

00:55:53.734 --> 00:56:04.114
I think I detect another thing with looking back, I see,
as the collective has got bigger, people develop quicker.

00:56:04.136 --> 00:56:09.001
That’s very important – collective is very
important. Collective is the nourishing garden.

00:56:10.624 --> 00:56:11.974
Helps a lot. Yes.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:17.404
Now supposing you try this experiment. If
there is a tree that is dying, you see.

00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:21.454
Now, you bring other trees next to it, it will grow.

00:56:22.066 --> 00:56:31.416
With a pot you see, little pot you can have where the flowers are dying. Bring it near the other pots which are healthy, it will grow.

00:56:31.435 --> 00:56:33.935
Normally it happens like this,

00:56:33.935 --> 00:56:37.458
that if you have one bad apple,
all the good apples will be spoilt.

00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:40.378
All their goodness cannot put that right, you see.

00:56:40.378 --> 00:56:45.891
That’s it. But with the growth, it happens.

00:56:45.931 --> 00:56:49.931
If something is living and
growing. If somebody is dead,

00:56:49.927 --> 00:56:53.521
then, of course, the decaying is much faster.

00:56:53.532 --> 00:56:59.175
But if somebody is living and growing, with
the more healthier people it grows faster.

00:56:59.175 --> 00:57:07.785
And isn’t it interesting Mother, how when somebody in the collective gets sick, the first thing they want to do is to move out.

00:57:08.446 --> 00:57:10.318
It is true?

00:57:12.436 --> 00:57:15.200
It is true, yes absolutely.

00:57:15.224 --> 00:57:20.245
It is almost as though they want to commit
suicide and just about want to destroy themselves.

00:57:20.285 --> 00:57:20.745
Who?

00:57:20.775 --> 00:57:22.811
Almost as if they want to destroy themselves.

00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:23.231
Yes.

00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:26.951
By moving out. Moving away.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.431
That’s a typical example.

00:57:39.039 --> 00:57:41.912
So many experiments you will be
doing, more and more and more

00:57:41.929 --> 00:57:44.429
and you will be amazed at the results.

00:57:46.689 --> 00:57:48.648
Very much.

00:57:48.648 --> 00:57:55.138
Sahaja Yoga is such an enterprise I should
say. Every day you discover something new,

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:59.330
every day you find out something
new, that you can manage.

00:57:59.347 --> 00:58:05.888
Like the flowers! The miracle of the flowers!

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:07.786
Michael’s breadboard, Mother.

00:58:07.786 --> 00:58:08.396
Huh?

00:58:08.396 --> 00:58:14.386
That piece of wood that you pushed the flowers down
was his breadboard, Mother that he cuts the bread on.

00:58:14.436 --> 00:58:15.783
Oh, I see!

00:58:15.816 --> 00:58:17.943
He’s never going to use it again.

00:58:17.946 --> 00:58:21.683
I have put it away in my bedroom, Mother.

00:58:22.337 --> 00:58:24.837
We couldn’t find anything to do that. You see

00:58:24.837 --> 00:58:30.014
I said they must be little bit dipped in
the water. Because I had vibrated the water.

00:58:30.036 --> 00:58:35.307
This was very cold water so I said, “Alright, let’s make
it little warm or hot.” They said, “The flowers will die.”

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:39.027
I said, “No, My hand is there. That will cool it down.”

00:58:39.027 --> 00:58:45.646
And all the flowers survived, all of them. And
they came up so well and they grew in size.

00:58:45.665 --> 00:58:52.526
Yes, they did. And Mother, was it the heat
from the body that killed the flowers or…

00:58:52.552 --> 00:58:53.932
Heat from the body!

00:58:53.932 --> 00:58:56.272
Why did the flowers start to die?

00:58:56.272 --> 00:59:01.542
Because of the heat from your bodies. You see,
there was too much heat you were passing in the body.

00:59:01.568 --> 00:59:06.236
While I put them in the water and I
vibrated the water, you see with My hand.

00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:12.705
So you see, I may be perspiring Myself but
I emit cool breeze. Ask him, he saw that.

00:59:12.705 --> 00:59:17.932
Oh yes, We went shopping, and Mother was
perspiring because it was very hot in the shop

00:59:17.957 --> 00:59:20.457
and I was helping Mother down the stairs.

00:59:20.457 --> 00:59:25.271
And all of a sudden, this “whoosh” came
over. I said “Mother, it can’t be!”

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:28.991
And his wife too. “See, Mother such
cool breeze you are giving us.”

00:59:28.991 --> 00:59:29.327
It just swept over us

00:59:29.343 --> 00:59:35.906
So I was cooling all of you and taking the heat
within Myself. It is like an air conditioner you see.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.900
That gets heated up and makes everything cool.

00:59:41.274 --> 00:59:44.040
Just like the back of fridge is very hot.

00:59:44.073 --> 00:59:49.296
Fridge is very hot. If you see the back
of it, yes that’s hot, that’s what it is.

00:59:50.705 --> 00:59:57.535
Even sometimes My tongue emits so much of heat I feel,
outside – the heat is going out in the night time.

00:59:57.579 --> 01:00:04.058
But if you put your finger around My nose in
the night, it is a very cool breeze coming.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:16.870
I wish Christ had told more about Holy
Ghost.  He had time to talk about it.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:28.674
Do you think, Mother that we have been told all that
Christ talked about or that it’s been a little bit lost?

01:00:28.718 --> 01:00:34.377
Lot of it must have been lost because I am sure
He must have told about Kundalini and all that.

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:39.800
But you see the disciples were not
realised until He lived, as you know that.

01:00:40.814 --> 01:00:43.760
And they were a very uncertain quantity.

01:00:43.794 --> 01:00:46.393
They were very frightened because He was crucified

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:52.653
and they couldn’t say that a man who was God
has been crucified by human beings, you see.

01:00:52.688 --> 01:00:56.998
How to prove that He was God is that.

01:00:56.997 --> 01:01:04.213
Matthews was very much frightened of saying
something about Immaculate Conception.

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:10.933
There was a big fight between him
and Paul because he outlasted Christ.

01:01:10.972 --> 01:01:16.980
And he wouldn’t say that – Paul would not say. In his
books, he has not mentioned a word about all this.

01:01:16.994 --> 01:01:23.515
But Matthews was forced by other disciples
that we must write whatever we have seen.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:33.186
So the whole thing became here like a, little … we
should say, a loose organisation between them,

01:01:33.207 --> 01:01:36.396
and they wrote whatever
they felt like in the Bible,

01:01:36.419 --> 01:01:42.706
but not what... John was enthusiastic and
young fellow. So he wrote lots of things.

01:01:42.706 --> 01:01:52.105
In that – as a dream or anything, or whatever it is,
but he wrote many things, which is quite good.

01:01:55.175 --> 01:02:00.685
But still, a lot of it’s missing because Christ
could not have missed those points; I am sure of it.

01:02:00.715 --> 01:02:03.255
Most of them just couldn’t write, could they?

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:09.352
Only Luke and Matthew would have been probably the only two who could write; I don’t know whether John could write.

01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:12.402
John could write also.

01:02:12.421 --> 01:02:14.921
But Matthew used to write really well.

01:02:14.921 --> 01:02:21.181
They were all fishermen. Ordinary people of ordinary intelligence.

01:02:21.172 --> 01:02:24.351
How far can you talk to them about Kundalini also?

01:02:24.382 --> 01:02:28.281
But I am sure Christ must have told
them that there’s  a force within you.

01:02:28.281 --> 01:02:32.104
That he must have told them. He
must have told them everything.

01:02:32.131 --> 01:02:40.231
And that is why when the cool breeze came to them,
you see, they felt that it is the Holy Ghost.

01:02:42.274 --> 01:02:44.774
Otherwise, they could not have related it to that.

01:02:44.774 --> 01:02:49.094
They must have known. Very
haphazard, the whole thing was.

01:02:53.056 --> 01:03:01.034
Also, like Christ made the wine. Now wine was in
those days not taken like the way we take it;

01:03:01.074 --> 01:03:06.756
it was called as ‘strong drinks’ and its
brew was prohibited: actually prohibited.

01:03:06.775 --> 01:03:11.300
If you read Moses, He has prohibited strong drinks clearly.

01:03:11.332 --> 01:03:16.422
But that was not Christ’s realm to talk
about. But still, He never made, you see

01:03:16.446 --> 01:03:25.716
wine, which we call as wine nowadays, alcoholic,
because alcohol cannot be made in one minute.

01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:32.871
That’s the point one should see. You see He..
it was… He made wine means He made the juice.

01:03:32.895 --> 01:03:34.151
Tastes like wine.

01:03:34.146 --> 01:03:41.385
The other day this Romano fellow: I asked him,
“You first take something,” because they all drink.

01:03:41.455 --> 01:03:47.082
So, he is the fan of the Italian
people, you know, the one who did Me.

01:03:47.112 --> 01:03:50.326
So he said, “You first you give me realisation.”

01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:56.342
So I put My hand in the thing and
I said, “Now you drink this water.”

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:58.175
He said, “This is water?”

01:03:58.175 --> 01:04:02.215
He asked the girl. “Yeah.” “You brought
water?” “Yes, I brought water.”

01:04:02.257 --> 01:04:12.546
He said, “No, this tastes like wine.” I
said, “Go ahead, drink.” Then he drank.

01:04:17.826 --> 01:04:23.217
And then also many things happened with
him because he arranged a programme,

01:04:23.217 --> 01:04:31.886
a big programme in Italy in a place where they
have a very expensive holiday camping place.

01:04:31.906 --> 01:04:36.565
They call it the Santa Pietra.

01:04:36.565 --> 01:04:42.419
Pietra is the stone, you see where there is a saint that is a stone;

01:04:42.419 --> 01:04:46.735
means must be some sort
of a swayambhu there.

01:04:46.745 --> 01:04:51.789
So we went there, to that...
Marina Santa Pietra is the place.

01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:59.270
And there he had a big programme in a big palace,
which had a very big open-air theatre and all that.

01:04:59.279 --> 01:05:01.080
There he had the programme.

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:08.500
But he told Me, “I’m sorry, but everybody has told me you
can’t have the programme, it’s going to rain cats and dogs.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:14.521
It’s going to have a very bad… also maybe
snowfall or maybe something like that.”

01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:20.496
I told him, “No, not possible. There
will be no rain at all, believe Me.”

01:05:20.515 --> 01:05:25.106
So we had Alganesh and Alganesh said,
“If Mother says so, we believe it.”

01:05:25.126 --> 01:05:31.106
He said, “My faith is not that strong as yours.”
I said, “Alright, but just try it once.”

01:05:31.126 --> 01:05:35.411
So Gregoire and all these people
had come from outside that area.

01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:39.656
They said, “Till we came inside the city, it was raining

01:05:39.656 --> 01:05:44.804
there was hailstorm, all things happening,
we thought we won’t be able to reach.

01:05:44.804 --> 01:05:46.716
It's not clear cut.”

01:05:46.716 --> 01:05:55.746
Then they came, and we had in the evening the programme.
It was absolutely clear sky: absolutely clear sky.

01:05:55.766 --> 01:06:01.926
And about six miles away from there, it was
raining, there was hailstorm all around.

01:06:01.933 --> 01:06:03.955
And the programme went off very well.

01:06:03.955 --> 01:06:10.535
So, in the beginning, only he said that, “The first miracle
is this; that She had told me there will not be any  rain,

01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:16.199
and everybody I telephoned, they said, “There’s
going to be rain. Take a bet on that.”

01:06:22.525 --> 01:06:31.234
A very nice man and it was very interesting in the way the whole programme came up, so many people got realisation.

01:06:31.275 --> 01:06:37.244
In Italy now it is quite established. Especially
in Milano areas, it is very much established.

01:06:40.092 --> 01:06:43.870
Italians are not so fond of
Pope; they have had enough of him.

01:06:43.903 --> 01:06:50.660
He has got six thousand schools all over Italy.
And very highly paid schools. Very highly paid.

01:06:50.692 --> 01:06:53.192
And nobody gets admissions there easily.

01:06:53.192 --> 01:06:55.811
It is a very big money racket.

01:06:55.838 --> 01:07:03.191
All those things they know. And they were saying that
every day there are six to seven thousand visitors

01:07:03.191 --> 01:07:09.640
and every visitor has to pay so much money when
he goes around, just for visiting the Vatican.

01:07:09.653 --> 01:07:12.153
All that he is earning every day.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:20.883
Such are his earnings, everything and I have seen he has really, tremendous amount of treasury: tremendous amount.

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:24.593
Even more than Tsars, and he doesn’t want to sell it.

01:07:24.593 --> 01:07:29.100
And while Italians were saying, that
we are so poor, that time.

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:32.799
And also you see, all the
Catholics are very poor.

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:36.869
Now, Italian things have improved.

01:07:36.909 --> 01:07:43.769
They asked Me for one thing – is mafia is to be
completely finished. That thing has happened now in Italy.

01:07:43.788 --> 01:07:48.905
Also that their poverty should go.
Now they have become very rich people.

01:07:54.338 --> 01:08:01.039
I had an aunt, Mother who lived just
north of Milan – in Como, on the lake.

01:08:01.073 --> 01:08:04.149
Really? We had a program there, in Como.

01:08:04.149 --> 01:08:05.119
It’s a beautiful place.

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:10.199
And such a big, huge hall – bigger
than yours, all filled with people.

01:08:10.213 --> 01:08:15.983
And one priest came and he started saying,
“Thank Mother for She has given us our light,

01:08:16.011 --> 01:08:19.453
She has given us our
Self-realisation.” I was amazed.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:20.093
A priest?

01:08:20.093 --> 01:08:22.129
Priest.

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:24.639
That is extraordinary.

01:08:29.369 --> 01:08:32.529
Because he is a priest, Sahaja
Yogis don’t allow him to come.

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:40.150
They said, “You better change your dress, otherwise, we
won’t allow you to come.” I did not say anything about it.

01:08:41.772 --> 01:08:46.130
There you can do it because Sahaja
Yoga is very much established.

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:59.359
So who is this psychologist who was teaching there?

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.840
What sort of a school?

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.480
It’s the teachers' college
Mother, for technical teachers.

01:09:05.544 --> 01:09:12.217
So I teach cooking, you know for the
trade – for the technical trade

01:09:12.264 --> 01:09:24.919
and we have plumbers, hairdressers,
pastry makers, cooks, electricians,

01:09:24.948 --> 01:09:31.219
and all we who teach have to then go to school
two days a week to learn how to teach further.

01:09:31.244 --> 01:09:35.086
So these are very big teachers that teach the teachers.

01:09:35.108 --> 01:09:38.820
But how… he is teaching psychology to you people also?

01:09:38.852 --> 01:09:42.150
Yes he is. yes. Psychology in education!

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:47.780
It is supposed to let me know what
happens inside the students’ heads.

01:09:49.922 --> 01:09:51.579
He shouldn’t be doing the teaching.

01:09:51.579 --> 01:09:56.899
What happens? But I mean, you are feeding the stomach
and the tongue – it never goes to the head, does it?

01:10:01.369 --> 01:10:07.249
I think any cooking done with
love turns out to be good food.

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:14.350
Yeah.

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:21.879
And every country has its own style
because it suits them that way, you see.

01:10:21.879 --> 01:10:25.409
Whatever suits that country, they have to take it.

01:10:27.777 --> 01:10:30.277
So now it’s done?

01:10:30.277 --> 01:10:34.037
Alright? May God Bless You.

01:10:38.772 --> 01:10:42.742
There is something I wanted to tell you both.

01:10:42.761 --> 01:10:45.261
It is a little personal.

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:54.523
You see, our great Mr David has married an Australian
girl, and like all other Englishmen, he doesn’t talk.

01:10:54.556 --> 01:10:58.485
So she says he doesn’t communicate.

01:10:58.511 --> 01:11:01.195
So I told that, “Englishmen don’t talk
much, you see.

01:11:01.211 --> 01:11:04.855
They allow others to talk. They
listen more than talk themselves.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:10.874
So you don’t get upset – you go on talking to him, he will
listen to you, and he’ll say few words to you in any case.”

01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:14.614
So I am just to going to warn you
people, you are marrying outside.

01:11:14.614 --> 01:11:21.993
Especially in America, they talk a lot, you see.
So just don’t keep quiet. You have to talk.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.777
If they say something you better talk. And
you have to start talking sometimes also.

01:11:26.785 --> 01:11:29.285
Because David really shocked Me.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.447
He said, “Really? I communicate all right, Mother.”

01:11:33.018 --> 01:11:35.157
He was quite surprised.

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:38.347
I said, “He is a quiet fellow.
That’s all, he’s a little quiet.”

01:11:41.937 --> 01:11:45.627
That’s the way they are; the English don’t talk much.

01:11:46.387 --> 01:11:57.275
I think it’s more that if you think the things… you think you’ve said them without actually saying, without actually communicating.

01:11:57.275 --> 01:12:02.025
But mentally, you feel you’re communicating, because  I used to find that with people thought that…

01:12:02.021 --> 01:12:09.549
I used to think that I was very quiet… that I spoke
a lot, but actually it was just going on in my head

01:12:09.555 --> 01:12:15.335
and it wasn’t actually, wasn’t actually really
communication, it was just in my own mind

01:12:15.358 --> 01:12:17.858
In your  head, you were talking.

01:12:17.858 --> 01:12:20.968
Must be.  You better tell David.

01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:25.218
You know, because poor David, he
didn’t know what was wrong with him.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:30.138
He’s a quiet fellow. He lived
in My house for a year or so.

01:12:30.148 --> 01:12:33.399
Quiet. You see, tell him something, he’ll do that.

01:12:33.399 --> 01:12:34.658
BREAK IN RECORDING

01:12:34.657 --> 01:12:36.718
with Gorbachev and your America.

01:12:36.747 --> 01:12:42.578
I mean she is a small country, now come down to your level and don’t tell people that, “We are British, British, British.”

01:12:42.578 --> 01:12:45.078
And all the money is drained off, you see.

01:12:45.078 --> 01:12:48.316
It’s so much trouble to these people, you know.

01:12:48.332 --> 01:12:52.463
Young people are really become
poor there. No jobs, nothing.

01:12:52.473 --> 01:12:58.763
All the money is going to missiles. What
are you going to do with these few missiles?

01:12:58.793 --> 01:13:01.293
Hopefully nothing!

01:13:02.443 --> 01:13:05.969
It’s terrible, terrible the way things are happening there.

01:13:05.989 --> 01:13:08.785
You see, I feel sometimes
that this lady has no heart.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.965
Like a mother to think about her children.
(British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher)

01:13:10.965 --> 01:13:15.655
So many young people are unemployed.
She is not bothered about unemployment.

01:13:15.686 --> 01:13:21.826
How these things come in? Because
of unemployment: drugs or anything.

01:13:21.855 --> 01:13:27.412
They have nothing to do poor things, what can they
do? What is their future? She is not bothered

01:13:31.162 --> 01:13:36.170
And now what she’s done? She has
done, is open the, you see, the market.

01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:42.410
This whole thing is open now. Anybody can go
and this bull and this stuff has started there.

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:47.980
Is all open; anybody can do what they
like. So the pound has gone up.

01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:57.444
Anybody can go and join the stock exchange.
So, yesterday the thing has gone up.

01:13:57.462 --> 01:14:00.934
The pound is up, alright.  But what’s the use?

01:14:04.192 --> 01:14:08.035
The pound has gone up but it’s no
good to you if you haven’t got any.

01:14:08.785 --> 01:14:11.285
It is artificially. It is not really.

01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:15.205
Because she has allowed people to take
their loans, as much as they want.

01:14:15.205 --> 01:14:17.705
Then another thing she has done; a very dangerous thing

01:14:17.705 --> 01:14:29.200
that whatever is the income out of the factories, she wants
to distribute them as bonuses to all the shareholders.

01:14:29.244 --> 01:14:32.792
So the factories will become
tomorrow very weak also.

01:14:33.828 --> 01:14:41.342
All money, all earnings are going to the
people. Just to have cheap popularity.

01:14:41.372 --> 01:14:45.919
Once all the money is wasted and frittered
away like this, what will happen?

01:14:45.955 --> 01:14:49.539
Even if they have more money, what
will they do? They will just drink.

01:14:54.432 --> 01:14:59.533
People are just buying things because they are getting
loans and loans. Everybody is getting a loan there.

01:14:59.533 --> 01:15:04.102
They are very anxious to give loans. And
because of that, the pound has gone up.

01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:08.349
It is a very artificial way.

01:15:08.349 --> 01:15:09.865
The same thing was done with Reagan.

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:14.465
Also, I must say that, in that country they
gave a lot of loans to other countries

01:15:14.465 --> 01:15:16.965
and that’s how they kept up
themselves. But now where are they?

01:15:16.965 --> 01:15:19.465
They cannot raise their
dollar whatever they may try.

01:15:24.635 --> 01:15:29.977
I mean, that’s not… that’s a capitalist country
now, as far as that thing is concerned.

01:15:30.016 --> 01:15:33.697
They are capitalists who are
ruling. And this is not capitalism.

01:15:33.736 --> 01:15:39.644
This is not conservatism. They
are not conserving at all.

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:49.208
And this country is another mess I see.

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:52.528
The labour laws are so high up.

01:15:52.528 --> 01:15:58.498
I remember a long time back, my husband used to say that,
“The worst is the labour of Australia.” I said, "Why?"

01:15:58.498 --> 01:16:02.568
“You see, now they are asking wages for bending.

01:16:02.567 --> 01:16:07.579
So now the wages in the whole of our shipping will
go up and we will have problems,” and this and that.

01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:12.050
So now they raised the wages of the
labour. Alright. So now what’s happening?

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:16.570
Because the labour is so expensive,
you cannot produce anything.

01:16:16.610 --> 01:16:20.560
Because you cannot produce anything,
so you get everything from abroad.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.610
People are just having their doles:

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:28.120
no wages, nothing, not working and spending more
for the things they are getting from abroad.

01:16:28.158 --> 01:16:32.330
Everything is imported in this
country.

01:16:32.382 --> 01:16:37.413
Everything, I was shocked. Everything
is imported in this country.

01:16:37.411 --> 01:16:42.992
It’s going to be like Canada,
which is depending on America.

01:16:43.023 --> 01:16:46.322
The same thing is even happening in
the television industry, Mother.

01:16:46.323 --> 01:16:52.192
One of our problems here in Melbourne,
trying to get television on

01:16:52.192 --> 01:16:56.718
particularly television to take
much interest in Your visit

01:16:56.724 --> 01:16:59.224
is they say, “Oh well, all our programs come from Sydney.”

01:16:59.224 --> 01:17:01.724
So everything’s being imported…

01:17:01.724 --> 01:17:02.748
They are what?

01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:04.728
They all come from Sydney.

01:17:04.728 --> 01:17:08.138
All the programs are in Sydney and they
send them down the line to Melbourne.

01:17:08.175 --> 01:17:14.008
It’s the same sort of thing is happening within
Australia. Everything is getting smaller and smaller.

01:17:14.018 --> 01:17:15.078
Not localised.

01:17:15.078 --> 01:17:15.598
No.

01:17:16.338 --> 01:17:22.516
But one thing is there. You may
not have localised, ah, this thing.

01:17:22.545 --> 01:17:28.749
But supposing tomorrow you start getting
everything from England, then what will happen?

01:17:28.751 --> 01:17:32.359
Everybody will have doles sitting at
home seeing the English programmes.

01:17:32.394 --> 01:17:36.074
And then it might only be from
India you might be getting.

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:41.194
After sometime and importing even that.

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:50.876
See, we must not keep our children without any work.

01:17:50.896 --> 01:17:53.916
That’s a very dangerous thing.

01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:55.906
That’s a very dangerous thing to do.

01:17:55.936 --> 01:18:00.116
Oh, I have to take that, I am sorry.

01:18:00.136 --> 01:18:05.345
(Hindi) Please get that to eat, what was
brought here just now. Yes, bran, bran.

01:18:05.364 --> 01:18:09.930
I will have to, according  to treatment of Mister…

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:15.600
I’ll  just take a second to have this. Let Me have
that. This is Mister… yes, I will take that.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.140
Yes, what is it?

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:28.570
Um... I wasn’t going to mention it before the programme Shri Mataji, but there are some negative ex-Sahaja Yogis in Adelaide…
