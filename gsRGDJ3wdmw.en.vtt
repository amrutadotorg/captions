00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.470
no no you see to begin with see it has

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.390
something to do with your nervous

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.090
alright so if your nervous system is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.649
disturbed you may not feel at all what

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.630
the nervous system best thing is to do

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.390
massage somebody should massage their

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.149
back hands also I have told many times

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.579
that you rub your hands vibrated olive

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.739
oil quite a lot and drop these things so

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.680
if they become self could be within

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
sensitivity but if they can feel the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.369
catches in this in the body that means

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.320
they're all right only that we should is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.300
not all right rub the thing all the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.580
machine work on we should be clear it

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.289
out and for we should be if you can use

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.630
say butter could rub on the here and rub

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.580
all these muscles listen with that all

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.280
these things will work out for your hand

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.440
but supposing you are there's no cool

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.479
breeze coming out of the head possibly

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.310
then the realization is not yet

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.300
established see other people should say

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.130
whether there's a cool breeze coming

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.959
because the person who is not realized

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.880
may not feeling supposing he does not

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.500
feel it and you feel it then he's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.270
realized to only think his chakras are

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280
to be cleared it's a different different

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.649
category of things then there are some

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.660
people whose Kundalini has not risen

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.300
there still sahaja yogi like that maybe

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.940
I don't know if there are any those

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.250
people who are unmarried for long they

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.170
are very difficult because they never

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.450
feel the cool things in that quite a lot

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.099
like that but it is not so they are

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.810
realized Souls in any case they may not

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.599
feel it but they realized so to see

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.520
because it kind of a soft as a kind of a

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.040
balance is developed after marriage

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.400
which is not there and that's how some

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.830
people don't feel

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.770
there are various reasons some people

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.940
who are oriented war they should turn

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.010
their left to the right

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.290
many at times they should find out from

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.239
the hands you see one hand is bigger one

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.130
hand is smaller that means the left side

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.140
if it is smaller that means you have to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.550
raise left over that you see from the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.410
size of the hands and all that you can

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.569
see putting one hand towards the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.550
photograph another hand outside work it

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.769
out in so many ways because you have

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.540
permutations and combinations of certain

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.860
mistakes but that doesn't mean you

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.840
develop this left it should be by any

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.400
chance because that's the worst thing

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.780
that can happen if you develop the left

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.420
Rashidi then it's a very difficult

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.420
situation now

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.849
for this kind of a thing I think I will

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.519
give you a complete lecture on one day

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.890
complete as to see what permutations and

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.390
combinations of different chakras can

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.390
feel all right

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.359
but symptoms are outside the symptoms

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.670
are mostly outside there's no need to

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:28.840
from a personality to see what it is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:31.180
since that is a very problem with a

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.769
problem with people that they don't feel

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.650
the vibration some people just don't

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.500
really how many there are like that

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:44.739
who never feel any vibration never

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.130
friend no you never your felt it

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.130
sometime

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.480
[Music]

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:04.170
which was good the answer what work you

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.790
are doing in Russia all right you had a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.459
left side catch all right you can see

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.859
clearly a right hand is very shining the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.870
left there is a problem you see this

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.090
these fingers are not so shiny as the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.609
things are you had a left side problem

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.799
if you remember it all right so that's

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.060
fighting in the ashram the vibrations

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.770
are fighting that's why I feel hot

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.600
there's something wrong it will correct

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.570
it will happen please put your right

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.110
hand always up and left I'm tall so it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.110
will correct
