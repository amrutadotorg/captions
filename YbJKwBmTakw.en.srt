00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:20,834
THE GUIDANCE OF A MOTHER

2
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:30,898
Seeker: Does Mother have a guru and
what point did She gain Self-realization?

3
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,381
Sahaja Yogi: Do you have a guru and at
what stage did You receive Self-realization?

4
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:38,389
Shri Mataji: I neither have a guru
nor I want you to have a guru.

5
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,772
You’d better become your own gurus.

6
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:45,545
Secondly, I’ve been born like that,
I never got any realization or anything.

7
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,764
I just got realization, I should say
human realization when I understood

8
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,748
what was the problem with human beings.

9
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:55,264
I worked on the all permutations and
combinations of human beings,

10
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:57,905
because I wanted to have an en-masse
media,

11
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,991
by which I could give realization
to thousands of people.

12
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:05,342
Because any discovery which is made
and is not brought to that level

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,748
it is absolutely detrimental to the growth.

14
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:17,763
For example, you see, Jesus was crucified.
Why? Because He was alone!

15
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:21,625
Only for His mother, nobody knew
what He was.

16
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:27,018
At that time He could not achieve this,
because you all were not there at the time.

17
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:30,622
And also other people –

18
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:34,461
you know how the saints have suffered,
how every prophet has suffered

19
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:39,253
because they could not create a mass
understanding of it.

20
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:42,992
So at a certain point it has to become
a mass thing.

21
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:48,488
In the tree of life there are only three
or four flowers in the beginning,

22
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,523
but when it grows, when the blossom
time comes,

23
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:56,735
then so many flowers are there and they
become the fruits.

24
00:01:56,936 --> 00:02:01,495
So I, I just saw that this is the time
I have to do this job.

25
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:06,845
So you would call it My “human” realization
when I understood human beings.

26
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,882
Of course even now sometimes I get
shocked the way they behave,

27
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:16,182
I mean, I just don’t understand, but
I think now I understand them.

28
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:21,284
Sahaja Yogi: So those people who can’t
quite understand that answer,

29
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:23,213
don’t think about it too much.
Shri Mataji: There’s another gentleman

30
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:26,087
who was asking a question. Sahaja Yogi:
Mother has to be somebody special,

31
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:28,442
but find out for yourself. That’s
the best way.

32
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:32,105
Shri Mataji: You don’t worry about Me,
you worry about yourself. Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

33
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:35,014
Shri Mataji: I must be someone, all right.
Even if I’m not, doesn’t matter.

34
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:37,317
If you are going to get it, why not
have it?

35
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,530
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?
Shri Mataji: Yes, My child?

36
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,053
Seeker: When I first learnt...
Excuse me?

37
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:47,294
Shri Mataji: Little loud. You can... Seeker:
When I first learnt about Kundalini -

38
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:58,075
a basic learning of that many years ago -
part of what I understood

39
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:04,757
was that the Kundalini... you talked
about raising it spontaneously.

40
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:09,710
Shri Mataji: Yes. Seeker: And what I had
understood was that you must always have

41
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:14,318
a master to help you raise it,
that somewhere it isn't save,

42
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,938
I mean, psycologically or emotionally
to raise it yourself,

43
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,316
that you need the master to guide you.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

44
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:25,496
Seeker: So I wanted to ask about the raising
of it spontaneously. Shri Mataji: Yes.

45
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:28,452
She’s asking me if, that she’s read,
that you have to have a master,

46
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:30,804
no doubt you have to have a master,
no doubt.

47
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:33,760
Meaning the person who is
an enlightened soul.

48
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:36,501
A person who is a realized soul can
only do it.

49
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:39,551
I wish Jung knew how to do it; he would
have done it himself.

50
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,619
So you have to have a master who is
called as a Sat Guru,

51
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,384
the one who has achieved the truth,
and who is a master.

52
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:51,492
Now I’m not a master, thank God,
I am not a master at all, I am a Mother.

53
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:56,195
And Mother is always a master in a way.
So that’s what it is.

54
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:59,715
But as far as I’m concerned,

55
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:06,215
I am too soft to be a master, I think,
because I cannot be hard with people.

56
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:09,265
So that’s what it is. So you have
to have a master.

57
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:13,738
But to get a master rather difficult,
better get a Mother.

58
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:18,271
Shri Mataji: Yes. Seeker: When some
of the speekers have talked

59
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:23,687
about the primordial masters,
they’re all male.

60
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:28,281
They incarnated in male bodies
and I was wondering

61
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:32,780
if there was a natural lineage or why
has that been over time, in history,

62
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,921
just say Abraham, Moses,
Lao Tse, etc.

63
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:40,515
Shri Mataji: You see, first we had
to build up the fatherhood,

64
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:46,264
you see, out of fear, because without fear
human beings won’t listen.

65
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:51,054
Imagine at the time of Moses, the Ten
Commandments that he brought

66
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:54,288
had to be chain, the people were
so horrid.

67
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:57,170
He had to make them very, very strict
at that time

68
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,991
you can see from the Books of Essenes, see,

69
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:04,366
you'll get the full idea as to how
terrible the people were.

70
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:12,022
Now, then we had to talk of Christ
because He had to cross the Agnya.

71
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:17,317
He had to cross it because that was the
problem. That time the ego was too much.

72
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:23,255
You see, imagine at the time of Romans how
they were horrid. So He had to do that job.

73
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,544
Now, today we have reached at a point
fagged out absolutely,

74
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:33,880
fed up of our egos, superegos, everything.
Now only the Mother can help you.

75
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:37,911
So it has to be at different various
levels of your awareness

76
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:42,950
one had to work out. Now is the time
of Mother to nourish you,

77
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,414
is Mother to give you that love

78
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:50,096
because you won’t be spoiled now any
more. That you will understand.

79
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:59,140
The authority with which Moses talked,
authority with which Socrates talked,

80
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:04,255
authority with which Lao Tse talked -

81
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,618
all these great Adi Gurus,

82
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:18,396
from Adi Nath to Sai Nath,

83
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:27,168
they didn't say, "If you do this way will
be good, or that way would be good."

84
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:32,302
No, "This is what it is, you better do it!"

85
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:40,982
This is what it is.

86
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:52,685
But in modern times those gurus
may not work out.

87
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:57,470
That's why a Mother had to come.

88
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:04,880
First to give you realization.

89
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,822
Because these gurus did not realize
another point:

90
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:17,419
that their disciples not understand
them at all.

91
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:22,554
Whatever they are doing, they are
doing out of awe.

92
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:27,414
But awe doesn't have understanding in it.

93
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:34,372
Or even the earlier ones may have had,

94
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:40,348
the generation that came afterwards
did not have.

95
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:46,653
So they turned the gurus into a façade

96
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:51,700
and the whole building they owned
as their own.

97
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:56,357
Creating all kinds of problems,

98
00:07:56,558 --> 00:08:01,587
killing the universality and
the collectivity

99
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:10,927
because Brahma Tattwa is the power
of the collectivity.

100
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:23,125
Is in everything - in the atom,
in the molecule, in the human heart.

101
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:28,728
Everywhere it is reflected, depending
on the reflector.

102
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:32,200
And it controls.

103
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:45,868
This understanding they had,

104
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:50,118
but the human understanding perhaps
they did not have.

105
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:53,790
That if you today tell them something
they might listen to us,

106
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,766
but tomorrow they will forget.

107
00:08:55,967 --> 00:09:01,195
So, it was necessary that you all should
be given realization.

108
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:07,490
Otherwise, also without realization,
what's the use?

109
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,599
What's the use of talking to people about
the colors, those who don't have eyes?

110
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,404
So realization has to be given.

111
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:22,310
So the first and foremost thing we have
to know

112
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:28,583
that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out
because Paramchaitanya

113
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:33,435
is transmitting compassion. It never
did before.

114
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:42,091
It never had that kind of an attitude which
it is there because I am a Mother.

115
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:47,576
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realization,

116
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:53,107
you have achieved a state which we can
call as a Self-realised souls.

117
00:09:53,308 --> 00:10:00,669
But still, because you got it so easily,
cheaply,

118
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,073
I think still we don’t realise what we
have got.

119
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:11,417
Still we do not practice meditation,

120
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:18,831
introspection and dedication.
Some are very much there...

121
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,034
Many people tell Me: “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas,

122
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:27,988
do this, do that, and then they got
their realization.

123
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:33,753
How is it these people you have blessed?”.
Even some great saints asked Me that.

124
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,417
“What right they had to get this
realization?

125
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:41,238
Why did you give them realization?
What have they achieved?”.

126
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,770
I said, “Only their desire.

127
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:48,044
Their desire was very much there that
they should get their realization

128
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:51,489
and that’s how they got it“.

129
00:10:51,731 --> 00:11:00,013
But now to go into only desire,
is not sufficient.

130
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:03,278
You have to depend on yourself,

131
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:07,200
on the light of your Spirit you should see
what’s wrong with you.

132
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:12,231
I am supposed to be your Guru,

133
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:22,419
but I feel sometimes that the idea
of a guru

134
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,544
is very different from Mine.

135
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:35,320
Normally a guru is a very, very
strict person,

136
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:39,810
and has no patience of any kind.

137
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:53,185
So, there are two, three types of tests are
all the time taken off the disciple.

138
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:58,982
Firstly how much they obey you.

139
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:11,879
But as you all have got realization
and you are your own gurus,

140
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,380
I don't put that condition on you.

141
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:26,502
I leave it to your freedom.
I tell you earnestly,

142
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:33,143
in all the ways possible, what I think
good for you.

143
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:39,370
But I don't compel

144
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:47,042
like these gurus used to do. I mean,
they used to beat,

145
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:52,463
they used to hang them on a well,

146
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:56,854
they were so very strict

147
00:12:57,055 --> 00:13:01,971
with their disciples and I've had
an experience of this.

148
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:08,120
They never used to smile, no question
of laughing,

149
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:19,940
and would never show any kind of weakness,
of kindness for the disciples.

150
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:24,221
You see a Guru has to be a very
angry person,

151
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:30,690
wearing only single dress either upwards or
downwards - I don’t know how they wear -

152
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,279
with a big thick rod in the hand,

153
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:43,127
never smiling – laughing no question –
smiling.

154
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:51,536
And the Gurus have to be very long faced,
developing big, big beards,

155
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:55,760
and no ladies allowed.

156
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:04,846
In such a situation, where the women
are not to be seen at all,

157
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:10,479
I mean, I shouldn’t even see My face –
it’s like that.

158
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:19,604
There is a big discussion in all
the scriptures -

159
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,612
and not scriptures, I would say
the critiques -

160
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:25,940
whether a woman should be
allowed

161
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:34,223
to do the spiritual practices or not,
imagine.

162
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:42,643
Not only among Christians, you’ll be
surprised, even in Indian scriptures –

163
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:49,192
whether is woman should be allowed
or not to do spiritual practices.

164
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:58,878
Now when your Mother is a woman
and She is your Guru, what will you do?

165
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:07,236
This is another confusion because
it is wrong;

166
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:14,656
the whole thing is falsehood, based
on no basis at all.

167
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:19,843
You may try anything to say that
women

168
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:26,914
are not meant for spiritual life,

169
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:32,508
try any argument, it fails.

170
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:42,564
The whole thing has to be brought up
this way that everything faces reality.

171
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:49,347
All these false ideas have to be
given up.

172
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,933
Like, if you have a carpet upside-down,
the whole design is upside-down.

173
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:58,121
But, if you put the carpet right,
everything falls in line.

174
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:04,350
And that’s why you needed a Mother
to give you realization,

175
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:08,660
and a Guru as a Mother to teach you

176
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:15,688
that for ascent of God nobody can
be prohibited.

177
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:19,823
Sahaja Yoga is not a military thing,

178
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:27,697
it’s just plain, simple, Mother’s love.

179
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:34,204
And of course every mother wants
her child to be great,

180
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:39,189
to have all her powers – she wants that,
no doubt.

181
00:16:40,108 --> 00:16:48,546
How she does it, how she works it out
is her own problem.

182
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:55,094
But how you take it and how you use it
is your own problem.

183
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,594
I always bow to you people who have
got realization,

184
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:02,937
because I think so many saints were
never there on this earth.

185
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:07,547
But the saintliness has to be complete.

186
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:12,062
Without that you cannot help even
your family,

187
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:18,336
leave alone your country, and no question
of the whole world.

188
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:28,158
So what is needed now is to raise your
awakening, to raise your spirituality,

189
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:35,180
to go into a realm of complete support
and surrender

190
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:42,250
to the movement of this spontaneous
movement of Sahaja Yoga.

191
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,445
May God bless you all.
