1
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:27,519
You are all ready to get married

2
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,314
and I bless you from My heart.

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,416
Now, the duty of a wife I need not tell
you, you know it very well.

4
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:49,022
I've told many a times that she is
responsible to build the society of Sahaj.

5
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:54,119
And as a result, she has [a] very great
responsibility.

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,653
She has to look after the whole family,
the relations of [the] husband,

7
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:13,851
and should go up to the great expectations
of the family members also.

8
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:17,833
This can be done if you have really love
for people.

9
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:22,304
If you have love, you wlll have tolerance
and you’ll be able

10
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:27,960
to bring more people in Sahaja Yoga who
are related to you and to your husband

11
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:35,892
by showing a very good household that
you have created.

12
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:45,625
Towards the husband you have to be
very dedicated

13
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:52,705
and don’t tell him about your past.
Past is finished and start afresh.

14
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:58,042
It’s a very dangerous thing to say anything
about your past to your husband.

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:07,939
So, you have your expectations, so he too
has his own expectations about you.

16
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,389
Expectations should not be there
in Sahaja Yoga.

17
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:19,194
But gradually, if you understand the value
of your marriage and you respect it,

18
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:23,496
then you will not go after superficial
things.

19
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:33,359
You’ll not ask him to buy this, buy that
for you on a material level.

20
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:40,271
But also on the mental level you should
not try to judge him,

21
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,085
but as you are spiritual, he is also
spiritual.

22
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:47,451
So, you should see his vibrations.

23
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:54,323
Don’t tell him but try to correct it slowly
and steadily.

24
00:02:54,524 --> 00:03:02,371
It’s easy to complain about married life,
very easy, and it’s [a] very common thing.

25
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:06,959
If there are two ladies who are
dissatisfied with their married life,

26
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:15,909
can create a big number of people who
will be complaining about marriages.

27
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,060
So, one has to be very watchful and
careful not to indulge into gossips

28
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:29,717
and talking about some things which has
no meaning in Sahaja Yoga.

29
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:34,869
Going to the higher life, we have to see
that, as we are spiritual people

30
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,843
we have to keep our spirituality growing
and growing

31
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:42,838
so that great souls who want to be born
on this earth

32
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,043
will take birth in your families.

33
00:03:46,244 --> 00:03:49,543
But that doesn’t mean, if you just get
attached to your own child,

34
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:53,815
then others' children are not to be loved.

35
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:59,447
Love doesn’t limit you, so you have to love
others' children also.

36
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:02,800
The guests who come in your house,
you must look after.

37
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,701
It is your duty to look after the guests.

38
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:12,610
They are Sahaja Yogis, you have no business
to insult them or to trouble them.

39
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:19,270
Your successful married life is going
to help so many people in this world.

40
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:24,608
We have to show that Sahaja Yoga marriages
are extremely successful,

41
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:28,827
peaceful and full of joy.

42
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:33,317
If you want to find faults, you see,
there [is] no end to it.

43
00:04:33,518 --> 00:04:38,619
But it’s better to see your own faults
and correct yourself.

44
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:47,729
Of course, if there is any problem which is
not soluble, which is absolutely difficult,

45
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,279
then you can let Me know and I’ll try
to solve it if possible.

46
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,219
Otherwise, you can depart. But it’s a very
last, extreme case.

47
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,826
It’s the wife who makes the family,
she makes the marriage very good.

48
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:08,593
So, it is for you to decide. Now, even now,
there is time,

49
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:11,886
if you don’t want to marry, you don’t like
your husbands

50
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:16,164
or in any way you think he is not
all right, you can decide now.

51
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:20,303
There is time still for you to decide.

52
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:24,753
We have to prove that our marriages,
Indian marriages,

53
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:30,242
are not Indian: they are universal
marriages,

54
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:37,599
and they are to be treated with that great
sense of responsibility.

55
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:45,067
Once you understand your responsibility,
I’m sure you will know what is to be done.

56
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:51,550
Firstly, you should never argue with your
husband, as far as possible.

57
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:59,463
You should not shout at him; you should
not be disrespectful for him before others.

58
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:03,969
And relationship between you and your
husband is a secret;

59
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:10,114
it should not be discussed
on the cross-roads, you see.

60
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:14,985
Let people see for themselves how happy
you are.

61
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:17,730
But there is no need to be artificially
happy.

62
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,402
There is no need to be artificially
suffering.

63
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,679
There is no suffering that is allowed
in Sahaja Yoga,

64
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,639
so if you think something is wrong...
[cut in the video].

65
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,080
… is done, it is sinful. One should never
do like that;

66
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,124
you are married in Sahaja Yoga not
to separate your husband from collectivity.

67
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:42,353
There’s more enjoyment, more sharing
and no pressure

68
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:45,707
if you all enjoy the collectivity.

69
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:52,642
I know you are all very wise and good girls
and you will look after your family life

70
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:57,981
and your social life and also look after
your husband.

71
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:05,614
But you should also look after other people
and try to understand your problems:

72
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:10,302
what problems you have, you had. And then
try to solve them

73
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:15,079
so that those who come to your house
or those who are in contact with you

74
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,320
will be specially blessed by your Gruha
Lakshmi quality.

75
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:24,669
In a collective way you must meditate.
You must meditate at home

76
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,665
and you must go to every meditation centre
whenever it is necessary.

77
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:35,660
I’ve seen the women in Sahaja Yoga are
rather poor for spirituality,

78
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,637
it’s very surprising. I am Myself a woman
and I can’t understand

79
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:45,744
that they are so busy, you see, doing
all other things but not meditation.

80
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:50,400
So, you have to become gems in Sahaja Yoga.
In spirituality you have to rise.

81
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,911
For that you must meditate at home

82
00:07:53,112 --> 00:08:00,018
and also go to all the collective
programmes you have.

83
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:03,877
This will help you a lot, help you,
your children;

84
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:06,027
they will become very good children,

85
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:13,979
and their whole standard of life will be
very much higher and spiritual.

86
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,851
We have to create these great families.
That’s why I was insisting

87
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:22,683
that we should have marriages here.
But by this, if we have

88
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:27,391
all the other kind of useless marriages,
it’s better not to have.

89
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:31,388
So, I request you to take up
the responsibility of a wife

90
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:37,346
and look after the whole family, look after
the whole family of Sahaja Yogis.

91
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:43,130
And apart from that, you have to think
what you can contribute to Sahaja Yoga.

92
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:46,797
We have some very great women who have
done a lot,

93
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,660
who are married women, done a lot
for Sahaja Yoga.

94
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,628
In the same way, you should take up upon
yourself to do Sahaja Yoga work

95
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:00,267
and Sahaja Yoga expansion.

96
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:05,701
I hope you understand how important
you are in Sahaja Yoga.

97
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:12,049
After all, this husband is more busy
outside

98
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,506
and maybe he might little bit neglect you.
But that doesn’t mean that he neglects;

99
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:21,384
you must understand that he has to work
hard and this and that.

100
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:25,460
Also, there's the demand on his time,
demand on his money

101
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,345
should be minimum, minimum that is
possible.

102
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:34,088
But if [the] husband is absolutely careless
about you, and doesn’t bother about you

103
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,992
or he dominates you or troubles you,
tortures you;

104
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:42,263
in any way if you are unhappy, you are
open, absolutely open to write to Me

105
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:44,185
about all that is happening,

106
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:50,520
because I’ll try to correct him and I’ll
try to see what is the problem inside.

107
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:56,024
The last thing one has to know [is] that
a woman has to be extremely moral.

108
00:09:56,233 --> 00:10:00,663
She has to be extremely moral. If she
becomes immoral,

109
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:04,358
the husband will become immoral,
the children will become immoral.

110
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,304
So, you have to stick onto your morality,
be proud of it and you can do it

111
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:12,968
because God has given you a special
quality.

112
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:17,801
So, it is your duty to keep great morality
in the family

113
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:28,987
and to live like good citizens of your
country, citizens of Sahaja Yoga family.

114
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:35,145
I bless you all with My heart again
and please accept what I’ve said.

115
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:40,403
If you don’t want, even now, not to marry,
you can decide that;

116
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:45,289
if possible, I will try to remove this out.

117
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,023
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
