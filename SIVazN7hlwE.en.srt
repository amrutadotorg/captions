1
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:11,126
But that is what we have to first of all

2
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:13,208
recondition ourselves,

3
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,998
by attaching ourselves emotionally to Mother.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,359
I mean, you have an advantage

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:28,123
over many other yogis of the world who came, poor things,

6
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,289
they had nothing to look forward.

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,748
They knew of a Primordial Mother, they knew about this,

8
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:36,247
but they had no Form.

9
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,915
You have a Form.

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,623
You are very fortunate and lucky people; you have a Form.

11
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:47,207
It's easy to adore a Form than to adore something abstract

12
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:48,539
in the air, do you see;

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,790
absolute consciousness,

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,873
how do you adore it when you can't see it?

15
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:58,456
But that attachment doesn't mean in any way

16
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:01,581
that you have to give Me anything.

17
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:02,873
What do you give Me?

18
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:06,581
Nothing, but detachment from the cause.

19
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:13,040
And this works out - you have seen it in your lifetime.

20
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:16,579
You also say that "It works out, Mother, somehow it worked out."

21
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:18,165
What is bandhan?

22
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:21,373
It's nothing but you are attaching yourself to your Mother,

23
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,581
you're just telephoning to Her.

24
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:27,207
This is a telephone going to your Mother,

25
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,748
that's all.

26
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,831
You know I also play with you, I also say,

27
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:35,265
"All right, I am giving you a bandhan."

28
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,831
I am giving bandhan to Myself!

29
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:39,456
It's a telephone call,

30
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:41,331
just a telephone call.

31
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:44,082
But the faith has developed now that yes,

32
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:46,082
this is the real faith,

33
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:50,706
where you get completely detached in your emotional things.

34
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:54,361
It's just "My mother" - all right, just give her a bandhan, finished.

35
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:57,594
"My father" - give him a bandhan.
"My brother" - give him a bandhan,

36
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,581
whatever it is.
Bandhan, whatever it is.

37
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,831
You are putting that ... in the bonds of your Mother.

38
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,998
But you are not conscious that you are doing that.

39
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,545
You are just binding them with the love of your Mother

40
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:12,474
which is flowing through your hands.

41
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:17,207
What are these vibrations, is your Mother's love.

42
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:22,873
You've got it, it is flowing through you.

43
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:26,212
But what about your love for your Mother?

44
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,250
And that is what I find,

45
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:33,123
that at the time when there is complete emergency

46
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:39,790
that surrender comes in, and it works.

47
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:45,207
So there's no need to create any emergencies.

48
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:49,665
You must slow and steadily work it out,

49
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:54,539
and it will build up by itself within you.

50
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,289
You will have that power within you, I assure you.

51
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:59,207
But meditation is one way;

52
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:02,289
another is the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

53
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,665
Not showing off, not telling others,

54
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:07,539
but working it out in yourself - different chakras,

55
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:08,790
how they work out,

56
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,414
on yourself, not on others.
