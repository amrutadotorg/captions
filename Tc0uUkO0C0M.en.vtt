WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:08.624
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

00:08.824 --> 00:15.964
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

00:18.054 --> 00:20.344
We can say this is the worship

00:20.544 --> 00:24.434
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

00:24.634 --> 00:34.364
If you understand that all this,

00:34.564 --> 00:41.394
whatever is created on this universe,

00:41.604 --> 00:48.844
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:49.284 --> 00:52.974
Now many people believe that there is one God.

00:53.174 --> 00:58.184
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

00:58.384 --> 01:06.734
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

01:06.934 --> 01:14.044
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

01:14.404 --> 01:22.234
So, first of all, He did was to create

01:22.434 --> 01:26.004
the power of Adi Shakti.

01:26.214 --> 01:32.544
When It was created then there was a sound,

01:32.744 --> 01:36.604
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

01:36.804 --> 01:39.024
by the primordial sound,

01:39.224 --> 01:43.284
and these three powers came out of that sound -

01:43.484 --> 01:49.004
is A, U and M -Aum.

01:49.394 --> 01:53.824
The Adi Shakti is the One

01:54.024 --> 02:01.304
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

02:02.154 --> 02:09.004
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

02:09.204 --> 02:15.764
and for His own expression,

02:15.964 --> 02:19.284
for His own manifestation,

02:19.484 --> 02:23.604
for His own reflection.

02:24.724 --> 02:29.504
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

02:29.704 --> 02:34.604
so He must have thought of creating a partner

02:34.804 --> 02:40.274
who will manifest His desires.

02:40.784 --> 02:50.284
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

02:50.484 --> 02:56.794
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

02:56.994 --> 03:02.274
His desire to create.

03:02.954 --> 03:07.014
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

03:07.214 --> 03:11.654
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

03:11.854 --> 03:15.684
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

03:15.884 --> 03:21.874
The attention has its own joy

03:22.074 --> 03:26.684
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

03:26.884 --> 03:30.044
She created all the universes,

03:30.244 --> 03:34.954
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

03:35.154 --> 03:40.644
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

03:40.854 --> 03:44.404
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

03:44.604 --> 03:50.994
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

03:52.404 --> 03:55.124
At this juncture one may ask that,

03:55.334 --> 04:00.494
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

04:01.044 --> 04:03.904
That was the idea of God Almighty,

04:04.104 --> 04:10.814
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

04:11.014 --> 04:17.294
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

04:17.564 --> 04:20.304
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

04:20.504 --> 04:24.464
She had Her own way of expression,

04:24.664 --> 04:28.394
that She thought She must create the mirrors

04:28.594 --> 04:34.034
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

04:34.234 --> 04:35.884
to see His character

04:36.094 --> 04:41.854
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

04:44.124 --> 04:48.454
This evolution had to work out this way

04:48.654 --> 04:54.284
because they had to know from where they come.

04:54.524 --> 05:00.714
We must know that we come from nature.

05:00.914 --> 05:06.614
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

05:06.824 --> 05:11.674
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

05:11.874 --> 05:17.734
And She too is not just a dead earth,

05:17.934 --> 05:22.474
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

05:22.684 --> 05:28.294
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

05:28.494 --> 05:35.484
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

05:35.684 --> 05:41.424
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

05:41.624 --> 05:46.264
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

05:46.464 --> 05:50.664
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

05:50.864 --> 05:54.804
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

05:55.004 --> 05:57.384
See the whole plan that was made.

05:57.584 --> 06:03.014
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

06:03.224 --> 06:07.974
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

06:08.174 --> 06:11.164
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

06:11.364 --> 06:13.684
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

06:13.884 --> 06:17.404
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

06:17.604 --> 06:23.494
This is the power that does all the living work,

06:23.694 --> 06:29.714
all the organization, all the creation.

06:34.274 --> 06:39.544
In our human ego we start thinking that

06:39.744 --> 06:43.594
we do something, we can create.

06:43.794 --> 06:50.094
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

06:50.294 --> 06:52.674
leave alone anything else.

06:52.874 --> 06:57.944
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

06:58.144 --> 07:03.644
we can put together and create something,

07:03.844 --> 07:13.224
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

07:13.424 --> 07:18.304
any power.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.544
We cannot create anything.

07:21.744 --> 07:29.514
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

07:29.714 --> 07:35.124
For example, something is made of gold.

07:35.324 --> 07:38.454
Still it is gold.

07:38.654 --> 07:41.794
Now something is made of wood,

07:41.994 --> 07:46.394
whatever it is made, is wood.

07:46.594 --> 07:50.164
The principle is the same into everything.

07:50.364 --> 07:55.084
So whatever may be your birth,

07:55.284 --> 07:58.164
whatever may be the country you are born,

07:58.364 --> 08:04.904
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

08:05.104 --> 08:08.724
basically you all are the same.

08:08.924 --> 08:14.364
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

08:14.564 --> 08:18.774
also, you cry the same way.

08:19.247 --> 08:22.644
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

08:22.844 --> 08:27.504
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

08:28.588 --> 08:33.634
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

08:33.834 --> 08:38.494
by some common principle of life.

08:38.694 --> 08:44.104
And the common principle of life that has bound us

08:44.314 --> 08:51.154
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

08:51.354 --> 08:54.064
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

08:54.264 --> 08:56.514
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

08:56.714 --> 09:00.854
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

09:01.054 --> 09:10.134
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

09:10.334 --> 09:13.614
But in the human form only

09:13.814 --> 09:20.754
it has evolved as a connection,

09:20.954 --> 09:26.344
as one that is the divine force within us,

09:26.544 --> 09:31.844
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

09:32.044 --> 09:37.994
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

09:38.194 --> 09:41.554
This is the common principle we all have.

09:41.754 --> 09:49.054
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

09:49.254 --> 09:54.234
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

09:54.444 --> 10:01.364
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

10:01.944 --> 10:04.514
Then there are people, as you people are,

10:04.714 --> 10:09.524
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

10:09.734 --> 10:12.694
who have got your realization.

10:12.894 --> 10:17.114
So when you understand that this is the

10:17.314 --> 10:24.254
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

10:24.454 --> 10:28.034
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

10:28.234 --> 10:29.924
and the enjoyment.

10:30.124 --> 10:39.864
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

10:40.074 --> 10:43.624
what should happen to you?

10:43.824 --> 10:48.274
What should we feel?

10:48.474 --> 10:54.564
How do we then exist?

10:55.284 --> 11:00.574
This is the question many a times you have asked.

11:00.934 --> 11:04.434
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

11:04.634 --> 11:06.064
that you are not there,

11:06.264 --> 11:10.194
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

11:10.394 --> 11:12.364
Secondly, what happens to you

11:12.564 --> 11:17.284
is that you become just the existence.

11:17.484 --> 11:20.244
Just the existence.

11:20.444 --> 11:22.994
And that existence that you become,

11:23.194 --> 11:28.554
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

11:29.074 --> 11:34.174
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

11:34.374 --> 11:36.214
also much before.

11:36.414 --> 11:38.924
In every religion we have had people

11:39.124 --> 11:43.594
who had this divine character very well developed.

11:43.794 --> 11:48.944
For example, even you can say,

11:49.144 --> 11:56.114
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

11:56.314 --> 12:03.184
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

12:03.384 --> 12:05.854
and a khumba also,

12:06.054 --> 12:08.934
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

12:09.134 --> 12:15.734
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

12:15.934 --> 12:20.544
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

12:20.744 --> 12:25.684
You know that there is this power within us.

12:25.894 --> 12:31.254
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

12:31.464 --> 12:36.894
from the middle path of our ascent.

12:37.094 --> 12:39.724
Here also the same Kundalini,

12:39.924 --> 12:45.130
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

12:45.544 --> 12:52.004
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

12:52.204 --> 12:57.014
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

12:57.214 --> 13:01.504
So now when we are enlightened people,

13:01.714 --> 13:06.884
we have become saints and we are above all others,

13:07.084 --> 13:14.154
what should we do is to understand fully well -

13:14.354 --> 13:17.464
not only mentally, but from your heart -

13:17.664 --> 13:23.774
that now you have got these divine vibrations

13:23.974 --> 13:29.064
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

13:29.264 --> 13:34.504
what are you, where is the problem.

13:34.704 --> 13:37.624
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

13:37.824 --> 13:42.354
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

13:42.554 --> 13:45.924
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

13:46.124 --> 13:49.504
with spiritual vibrations."

13:49.704 --> 13:52.114
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

13:52.314 --> 13:54.274
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

13:54.474 --> 13:58.664
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

13:58.864 --> 14:02.904
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

14:03.104 --> 14:05.014
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

14:05.214 --> 14:07.104
from here only there are vibrations,

14:07.304 --> 14:09.674
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

14:09.874 --> 14:12.244
So then he sat down and started wondering,

14:12.444 --> 14:17.494
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

14:17.694 --> 14:23.404
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

14:23.604 --> 14:27.434
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

14:27.644 --> 14:31.544
and that's how he found the place.

14:31.944 --> 14:34.214
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

14:34.414 --> 14:37.324
is not done haphazard, in any way.

14:37.524 --> 14:40.694
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

14:40.894 --> 14:47.024
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

14:47.604 --> 14:53.044
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

14:53.464 --> 14:55.794
We are the ones which spoil the nature

14:55.994 --> 15:00.294
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

15:00.494 --> 15:02.594
and we have to respect it.

15:02.794 --> 15:04.884
I've already told you many a times

15:05.084 --> 15:07.974
about how human beings were formed

15:08.174 --> 15:15.124
by different chemicals who came also,

15:15.324 --> 15:18.384
carbon came from the mother earth.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.824
All this leads us to understand

15:22.024 --> 15:26.674
that we have a very big responsibility.

15:27.234 --> 15:33.224
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

15:33.424 --> 15:36.134
And now you all have reached a state

15:36.334 --> 15:40.274
where you have become yourself.

15:40.474 --> 15:42.624
You know yourself.

15:42.824 --> 15:46.874
This is a very big, I think should say,

15:47.074 --> 15:54.384
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

15:56.754 --> 16:03.504
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

16:32.974 --> 16:38.384
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

16:38.584 --> 16:45.704
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

16:45.904 --> 16:55.584
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

16:57.024 --> 17:02.074
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

17:02.274 --> 17:06.004
and these centers have to be awakened

17:06.204 --> 17:09.704
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

17:09.904 --> 17:17.684
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

17:18.544 --> 17:27.474
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

17:27.674 --> 17:32.404
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

17:32.604 --> 17:38.534
from the path of your perfection.

17:39.634 --> 17:43.074
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

17:43.274 --> 17:47.784
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

17:47.994 --> 17:51.904
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

17:52.104 --> 17:56.724
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

17:56.924 --> 18:01.684
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

18:01.994 --> 18:05.774
There are so many ways of people relating

18:05.974 --> 18:09.634
to the power of the Divine.

18:09.844 --> 18:14.124
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

18:14.324 --> 18:19.794
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

18:19.994 --> 18:23.174
and through Her the whole universe was created.

18:23.374 --> 18:31.114
But also true that as you are seeking,

18:31.324 --> 18:34.564
also the Divine is seeking you.

18:34.764 --> 18:43.114
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

18:43.314 --> 18:50.874
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

18:51.074 --> 18:56.834
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

18:57.034 --> 19:01.004
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

19:01.204 --> 19:04.174
It is the One which has given you

19:04.374 --> 19:07.354
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

19:07.554 --> 19:11.904
"Whatever we have is given by You".

19:12.224 --> 19:16.614
If that is the case that all that you have

19:16.814 --> 19:21.264
is given by your Kundalini,

19:21.474 --> 19:25.164
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

19:25.364 --> 19:30.124
then is very important to understand what is the need

19:30.374 --> 19:37.994
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

19:39.444 --> 19:46.964
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

19:48.394 --> 19:51.574
As I said, there's a relationship

19:51.774 --> 19:58.304
between the realized souls and the Divine.

19:58.504 --> 20:02.364
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

20:02.574 --> 20:08.234
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

20:08.434 --> 20:11.874
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

20:12.074 --> 20:14.924
It's such a relationship.

20:15.124 --> 20:18.254
And it's so close, it's so close,

20:18.454 --> 20:23.714
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

20:23.914 --> 20:30.814
or the moon has its own moonlight.

20:31.014 --> 20:42.244
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

20:42.444 --> 20:47.664
and that should give you full control over yourself

20:47.864 --> 20:53.204
and over your development.

20:53.704 --> 21:01.254
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

21:02.114 --> 21:05.874
Now

21:11.469 --> 21:16.604
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

21:16.824 --> 21:19.534
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

21:19.734 --> 21:21.134
you may.

21:21.344 --> 21:23.274
But as soon as that person will disappear,

21:23.474 --> 21:26.574
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

21:26.774 --> 21:30.044
That surrender has no meaning.

21:30.244 --> 21:36.474
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

21:36.674 --> 21:40.604
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

21:40.814 --> 21:44.394
because it has a reaction.

21:44.594 --> 21:52.614
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

21:52.844 --> 22:08.714
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

22:08.914 --> 22:14.614
into the water automatically,

22:14.814 --> 22:22.554
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

22:23.154 --> 22:27.594
If you can just feel that within yourself,

22:27.794 --> 22:30.984
that you are one with the Divine.

22:31.184 --> 22:36.274
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

22:36.774 --> 22:46.644
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

22:46.854 --> 22:53.244
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

22:53.444 --> 23:00.424
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

23:01.054 --> 23:06.404
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

23:06.604 --> 23:10.444
There's a great joy in forgiving,

23:10.644 --> 23:15.164
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

23:15.364 --> 23:21.664
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.774
Nobody can disturb you.

23:25.974 --> 23:30.424
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

23:30.624 --> 23:32.864
that is what is forgiveness.

23:33.064 --> 23:37.584
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

23:37.784 --> 23:40.524
or to do something against somebody.

23:40.724 --> 23:44.714
The Divine takes over from you

23:44.914 --> 23:47.814
and does whatever is needed,

23:48.014 --> 23:54.684
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

23:55.084 --> 24:00.244
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

24:00.444 --> 24:02.684
say in Islam called ruh;

24:02.884 --> 24:07.664
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

24:07.864 --> 24:12.044
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

24:12.244 --> 24:18.004
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

24:18.204 --> 24:22.804
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

24:23.004 --> 24:26.564
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

24:26.764 --> 24:32.324
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

24:32.524 --> 24:37.484
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

24:37.694 --> 24:40.024
how to make others feel it.

24:40.224 --> 24:43.714
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

24:43.914 --> 24:45.964
or something nonsensical.

24:46.164 --> 24:49.944
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

24:50.144 --> 24:56.064
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

24:56.264 --> 25:02.104
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

25:02.304 --> 25:06.384
that you know there is this Power.

25:06.584 --> 25:08.934
You're sure about this Power

25:09.134 --> 25:13.314
because you can feel it within yourself.

25:13.514 --> 25:16.454
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

25:16.664 --> 25:22.834
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

25:23.034 --> 25:28.644
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

25:28.844 --> 25:38.174
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

25:38.384 --> 25:41.614
She tells you the truth.

25:43.664 --> 25:48.654
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

25:48.854 --> 25:53.494
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

25:53.694 --> 25:57.454
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

25:57.664 --> 26:02.884
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

26:03.084 --> 26:05.434
This kind of argument is possible.

26:05.634 --> 26:08.354
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

26:08.554 --> 26:11.224
that you forgive that person,

26:11.424 --> 26:16.014
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

26:16.214 --> 26:19.034
you don't do anything.

26:19.234 --> 26:20.714
That's the truth.

26:20.924 --> 26:25.464
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

26:25.664 --> 26:29.124
compassion becomes the truth.

26:29.324 --> 26:33.004
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

26:33.204 --> 26:36.344
So all the absolute truth that you know is

26:36.544 --> 26:41.184
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

26:41.384 --> 26:46.094
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

26:46.294 --> 26:49.464
and we felt this way and still it happened."

26:49.674 --> 26:52.604
It makes no difference.

26:52.804 --> 26:55.664
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.904
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

27:00.104 --> 27:04.334
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

27:04.534 --> 27:09.154
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

27:09.354 --> 27:12.754
Because it had to be the other way round.

27:12.954 --> 27:16.364
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

27:16.574 --> 27:21.394
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

27:21.594 --> 27:24.294
So, it's a play going on.

27:24.494 --> 27:30.754
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

27:30.964 --> 27:39.704
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

27:39.904 --> 27:45.214
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

27:45.414 --> 27:49.884
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

27:50.084 --> 27:53.994
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

27:54.194 --> 28:01.724
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

28:02.004 --> 28:10.564
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

28:11.044 --> 28:13.694
When you have the enlightened faith,

28:13.894 --> 28:20.424
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

28:20.624 --> 28:26.464
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

28:26.954 --> 28:31.784
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

28:31.984 --> 28:37.664
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

28:38.054 --> 28:41.444
Not necessarily. It's a play.

28:41.644 --> 28:49.534
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

28:49.734 --> 28:53.074
So if you can become the witness,

28:53.274 --> 28:56.844
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

28:57.044 --> 29:04.454
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

29:04.924 --> 29:10.644
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

29:10.844 --> 29:13.704
That dissolution has to take place.

29:13.904 --> 29:17.624
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

29:17.824 --> 29:23.364
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

29:23.564 --> 29:27.664
this work could not have been done.

29:27.874 --> 29:32.924
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

29:33.124 --> 29:45.024
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

29:45.234 --> 29:49.094
all the aspects of this human life.

29:49.294 --> 29:52.864
It had to be such an Incarnation

29:53.064 --> 30:01.054
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

30:01.254 --> 30:05.574
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

30:05.774 --> 30:13.404
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

30:13.604 --> 30:16.634
as a whole, as a human being.

30:16.834 --> 30:21.164
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

30:21.364 --> 30:24.684
all of them are just the same.

30:24.894 --> 30:34.054
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

30:34.254 --> 30:38.134
some are not seeking genuinely,

30:38.334 --> 30:41.784
and some are not seeking at all.

30:41.984 --> 30:46.874
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

30:47.084 --> 30:52.924
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

30:53.124 --> 30:57.694
one fish came out of the mother.

30:57.894 --> 31:04.864
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

31:05.064 --> 31:10.384
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

31:10.584 --> 31:15.614
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

31:16.014 --> 31:22.724
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

31:23.224 --> 31:27.594
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

31:27.794 --> 31:31.604
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

31:31.804 --> 31:34.414
James or what St. John has said,

31:34.614 --> 31:37.464
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

31:37.654 --> 31:39.214
It doesn't matter.

31:39.414 --> 31:47.084
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

31:47.294 --> 31:51.264
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

31:51.464 --> 31:56.274
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

31:56.474 --> 32:01.694
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

32:01.894 --> 32:05.894
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

32:06.094 --> 32:08.874
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

32:09.074 --> 32:13.134
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

32:13.334 --> 32:17.294
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

32:17.494 --> 32:19.474
should not disturb you much

32:19.674 --> 32:24.224
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

32:24.424 --> 32:28.274
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

32:28.474 --> 32:32.814
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

32:33.014 --> 32:38.864
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

32:39.064 --> 32:43.054
all the useless things that we have,

32:43.254 --> 32:46.624
like our conditioning and our ego.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.854
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

32:50.054 --> 32:53.774
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

32:53.974 --> 32:57.844
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

32:58.044 --> 33:02.284
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

33:02.484 --> 33:04.224
That's human nature also.

33:04.424 --> 33:08.064
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

33:08.264 --> 33:11.794
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

33:11.994 --> 33:15.574
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

33:15.774 --> 33:20.234
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

33:20.434 --> 33:22.374
It will all work out.

33:22.574 --> 33:26.794
It will all work out, but your attention should be

33:26.994 --> 33:34.164
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

33:34.364 --> 33:36.984
of this compassion?".

33:37.184 --> 33:42.514
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

33:42.714 --> 33:46.244
which is going to give you strength.

33:46.444 --> 33:49.474
This compassion within you,

33:49.674 --> 33:53.254
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

33:53.454 --> 33:56.734
completely destroyed,

33:56.934 --> 34:00.734
your compassion itself will make you powerful

34:00.934 --> 34:05.194
and you'll do everything that is needed.

34:05.394 --> 34:09.724
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

34:09.924 --> 34:18.094
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

34:18.364 --> 34:21.004
And amazingly as you will do this,

34:21.204 --> 34:25.994
your own level of spirituality will rise.

34:27.874 --> 34:30.824
As you see, I would say,

34:31.024 --> 34:36.324
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

34:36.524 --> 34:38.874
the water rises.

34:39.074 --> 34:45.144
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

34:45.344 --> 34:49.124
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

34:49.324 --> 34:53.734
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

34:53.934 --> 34:56.284
there will be much more manifestation

34:56.484 --> 35:02.724
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

35:03.084 --> 35:09.604
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

35:09.804 --> 35:12.314
you all have got your Realization

35:12.514 --> 35:16.914
and that you are all now saintly people,

35:17.114 --> 35:20.514
then we should see to people who were like you.

35:20.714 --> 35:24.704
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

35:24.904 --> 35:28.744
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

35:28.944 --> 35:34.334
What did they do? They went all out

35:34.534 --> 35:38.704
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.984
They could not give realization as such,

35:41.184 --> 35:43.694
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

35:43.894 --> 35:48.294
they talked about it, they sang about it.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.674
That's what we have to understand

35:51.904 --> 36:01.024
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

36:01.224 --> 36:03.514
When you know the people are getting drowned,

36:03.714 --> 36:08.984
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

36:09.184 --> 36:14.944
I should say,

36:15.144 --> 36:20.804
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

36:21.014 --> 36:24.054
And if you have that compassion within you,

36:24.264 --> 36:29.304
you will go all out to save them.

36:29.504 --> 36:35.464
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

36:35.664 --> 36:40.534
of this enjoyment of your attention.

36:40.734 --> 36:44.044
Your attention itself will enjoy

36:44.244 --> 36:53.384
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

36:53.584 --> 36:56.614
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

36:56.814 --> 37:00.134
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

37:00.334 --> 37:05.984
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

37:06.184 --> 37:12.494
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

37:12.694 --> 37:15.174
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

37:15.374 --> 37:19.944
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

37:20.144 --> 37:26.434
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

37:26.634 --> 37:31.734
The more you use this power the better it will be.

37:31.934 --> 37:36.854
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

37:37.054 --> 37:41.044
For we haven't got many people from the black race

37:41.244 --> 37:43.174
I think, from Africa.

37:43.374 --> 37:47.704
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

37:47.904 --> 37:51.104
Also, we have so many other areas

37:51.304 --> 37:54.534
where I find we have to work it out,

37:54.734 --> 38:01.394
that if this compassion is within you

38:01.594 --> 38:03.934
then it will compel you, also,

38:04.134 --> 38:07.844
to do work that will bring solace to people

38:08.044 --> 38:10.764
who are not even seeking.

38:10.964 --> 38:16.104
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

38:16.304 --> 38:21.534
which will really create very beautiful institutions

38:21.734 --> 38:26.404
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

38:26.604 --> 38:30.644
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

38:30.844 --> 38:35.484
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

38:35.684 --> 38:40.934
you have dropped out your greed,

38:41.134 --> 38:47.144
you have dropped out your lust.

38:47.344 --> 38:52.314
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

38:52.524 --> 38:56.224
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

38:56.424 --> 38:59.864
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

39:00.064 --> 39:01.954
and then they start becoming leaders,

39:02.154 --> 39:07.854
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.914
This you will not do.

39:11.114 --> 39:18.144
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

39:18.344 --> 39:24.574
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

39:24.774 --> 39:31.014
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

39:31.214 --> 39:35.284
Once we start spreading out like that,

39:35.484 --> 39:38.354
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

39:38.564 --> 39:41.584
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

39:41.784 --> 39:48.414
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

39:48.614 --> 39:52.244
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

39:52.444 --> 39:54.344
who don't have greed.

39:54.544 --> 39:57.484
I have known people who never had any greed,

39:57.684 --> 40:03.364
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

40:03.564 --> 40:06.874
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

40:07.104 --> 40:10.674
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

40:10.874 --> 40:14.304
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

40:14.504 --> 40:16.934
But not Sahaja Yogis.

40:17.134 --> 40:19.364
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

40:19.564 --> 40:25.434
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

40:25.634 --> 40:28.784
Not their lust, not their greed

40:28.984 --> 40:32.704
and also the so-called deviations

40:32.904 --> 40:39.524
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

40:39.804 --> 40:42.454
Because they know what do they enjoy,

40:42.654 --> 40:45.044
where lies their enjoyment.

40:45.244 --> 40:47.644
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

40:47.844 --> 40:51.454
you will try to have more of it

40:51.654 --> 40:56.464
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

40:56.664 --> 40:59.574
I would say as the men are working it out,

40:59.774 --> 41:01.514
women should work it out

41:01.714 --> 41:07.074
because women have more sense of compassion,

41:07.274 --> 41:11.624
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

41:11.824 --> 41:14.824
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

41:15.024 --> 41:17.914
I'm saying about normal.

41:18.114 --> 41:23.374
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

41:23.574 --> 41:28.074
they have known what is love for the children is.

41:28.274 --> 41:30.034
Mother doesn't expect anything.

41:30.234 --> 41:33.914
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

41:34.114 --> 41:37.114
She enjoys her child, that's all.

41:37.314 --> 41:44.134
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

41:44.344 --> 41:46.294
See, I have seen young girls.

41:46.494 --> 41:49.894
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

41:50.104 --> 41:53.534
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

41:53.734 --> 41:58.354
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

41:58.564 --> 42:04.694
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

42:04.894 --> 42:09.034
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

42:09.244 --> 42:13.534
And as you are all married also,

42:13.734 --> 42:18.744
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

42:18.944 --> 42:25.674
by your own nature of Divinity.

42:25.874 --> 42:27.994
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

42:28.204 --> 42:32.084
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

42:32.284 --> 42:36.124
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

42:36.324 --> 42:39.774
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

42:39.974 --> 42:43.524
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

42:43.724 --> 42:46.754
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

42:46.954 --> 42:54.634
And if something

42:54.834 --> 42:57.134
has to be done, has to be done.

42:57.334 --> 42:59.514
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

42:59.714 --> 43:03.264
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

43:03.464 --> 43:06.644
and the household and this and that".

43:06.844 --> 43:10.444
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

43:10.444 --> 43:13.174
The whole day, what will you do?

43:13.374 --> 43:16.924
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

43:17.124 --> 43:20.974
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

43:21.174 --> 43:25.394
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

43:25.594 --> 43:30.544
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

43:30.744 --> 43:36.394
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

43:36.594 --> 43:44.764
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

43:44.964 --> 43:48.904
then you'll be never tired.

43:49.104 --> 43:51.944
You will never grudge.

43:52.144 --> 43:57.404
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

43:57.854 --> 44:01.644
This is a very important point that we should realize

44:01.844 --> 44:05.144
that if somebody is a woman or a man

44:05.344 --> 44:11.254
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

44:11.454 --> 44:16.294
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

44:16.494 --> 44:20.864
She has more power of compassion.

44:21.064 --> 44:24.384
In the same way the man has more power of action.

44:24.594 --> 44:27.584
So, the compassion has to become active.

44:27.784 --> 44:30.844
In this combination everything will work out

44:31.054 --> 44:33.324
in a very beautiful manner.

44:33.524 --> 44:38.304
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

44:38.504 --> 44:43.274
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

44:43.474 --> 44:46.534
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

44:46.734 --> 44:48.714
some of the women have been men

44:48.914 --> 44:53.564
and some of the men have been women.

44:53.764 --> 44:58.134
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

44:58.344 --> 45:04.064
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

45:04.264 --> 45:05.684
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

45:05.884 --> 45:08.424
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

45:08.624 --> 45:11.324
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

45:11.534 --> 45:13.324
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

45:13.534 --> 45:16.334
Now here you should understand the relationship

45:16.544 --> 45:20.844
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

45:21.044 --> 45:27.014
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

45:27.224 --> 45:29.514
God Almighty is the Spectator;

45:29.714 --> 45:34.474
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

45:34.674 --> 45:37.084
She is compassion, of course.

45:37.284 --> 45:41.064
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

45:41.264 --> 45:44.684
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

45:44.884 --> 45:48.984
But He's the One who takes charge.

45:49.184 --> 45:54.224
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

45:54.424 --> 45:58.494
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

45:58.694 --> 46:03.594
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

46:03.804 --> 46:07.094
how it has worked out.

46:07.294 --> 46:11.344
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

46:11.544 --> 46:15.614
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

46:15.814 --> 46:20.304
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

46:20.504 --> 46:25.834
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

46:26.034 --> 46:27.804
I can't understand

46:28.004 --> 46:31.844
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

46:32.054 --> 46:38.724
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

46:38.924 --> 46:42.724
who knows what is the truth,

46:42.924 --> 46:51.824
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

46:52.024 --> 47:01.014
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

47:02.704 --> 47:06.424
It is to realize

47:06.624 --> 47:14.874
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

47:15.174 --> 47:19.114
You have entered into His kingdom

47:19.314 --> 47:25.654
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

47:25.854 --> 47:29.124
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

47:29.324 --> 47:32.004
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

47:32.204 --> 47:35.884
he still begs sitting on this throne.

47:36.084 --> 47:39.884
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

47:40.084 --> 47:42.754
I receive some funny letters sometimes

47:42.954 --> 47:47.494
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

47:47.694 --> 47:52.964
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

47:53.164 --> 47:59.064
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

47:59.274 --> 48:01.634
because it has a very bad impression,

48:01.834 --> 48:07.084
also, for other people and for your own life.

48:07.284 --> 48:10.924
For your own life, is very important

48:11.124 --> 48:15.304
that you should grow fully into the understanding

48:15.504 --> 48:21.434
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

48:21.634 --> 48:25.704
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

48:25.904 --> 48:30.034
What do you have to surrender?

48:31.604 --> 48:34.474
Just think of it.

48:34.674 --> 48:42.004
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

48:42.204 --> 48:48.314
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

48:48.514 --> 48:55.094
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

48:55.294 --> 49:00.084
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

49:00.284 --> 49:05.074
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

49:05.274 --> 49:08.324
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

49:08.524 --> 49:10.064
Impossible.

49:10.264 --> 49:15.334
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

49:15.534 --> 49:18.104
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

49:18.304 --> 49:21.514
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

49:21.714 --> 49:28.234
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

49:28.434 --> 49:32.254
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

49:32.454 --> 49:38.794
have to enter into and work out.

49:38.994 --> 49:40.514
You can do it.

49:40.714 --> 49:45.974
You see, I was surprised that in this place

49:46.174 --> 49:51.364
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

49:51.564 --> 49:55.994
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

49:56.194 --> 49:59.234
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

49:59.434 --> 50:06.254
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

50:06.454 --> 50:12.034
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

50:12.234 --> 50:15.284
As it is growing in quantity,

50:15.484 --> 50:19.194
it should also grow in quality.

50:19.394 --> 50:24.254
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

50:24.454 --> 50:26.564
Because I know all the time

50:26.774 --> 50:29.614
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

50:29.814 --> 50:33.094
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

50:33.294 --> 50:37.444
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

50:37.644 --> 50:39.654
I know that feeling you have that,

50:39.854 --> 50:43.284
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

50:43.484 --> 50:45.354
So forget about them.

50:45.564 --> 50:52.284
But those who are seeking, approach them.

50:52.494 --> 50:54.644
They are your real relations.

50:54.844 --> 50:58.754
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

50:58.954 --> 51:02.654
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

51:02.854 --> 51:05.894
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

51:06.094 --> 51:10.294
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

51:10.494 --> 51:14.234
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

51:14.434 --> 51:17.144
You should find out where are they.

51:17.344 --> 51:20.054
My attention is, of course, is with you

51:20.254 --> 51:25.034
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

51:25.244 --> 51:26.644
Whatever you want,

51:26.844 --> 51:31.334
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

51:31.534 --> 51:36.894
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

51:37.104 --> 51:40.114
Because you take it upon yourself.

51:40.314 --> 51:45.854
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

51:46.054 --> 51:53.214
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

51:53.424 --> 51:59.984
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

52:00.704 --> 52:03.934
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

52:04.134 --> 52:07.974
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

52:08.174 --> 52:12.164
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

52:12.374 --> 52:15.414
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

52:15.624 --> 52:17.814
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

52:18.014 --> 52:21.014
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

52:21.214 --> 52:22.704
is Adi Shakti.

52:22.904 --> 52:26.204
It's very important that this puja must be performed

52:26.404 --> 52:32.474
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

52:32.674 --> 52:35.634
and you grow more and more within yourself

52:35.834 --> 52:40.564
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

52:40.764 --> 52:45.564
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

52:45.764 --> 52:48.244
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

52:48.444 --> 52:52.274
within you is the Kundalini.

52:52.474 --> 52:53.724
So, you have to worship.

52:53.924 --> 52:58.084
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

52:58.284 --> 53:01.654
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

53:01.854 --> 53:05.354
May God bless you.
