00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.624
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:15.964
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

00:00:18.054 --> 00:00:20.344
We can say this is the worship

00:00:20.544 --> 00:00:24.434
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:34.364
If you understand that all this,

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:41.394
whatever is created on this universe,

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:48.844
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:52.974
Now many people believe that there is one God.

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:58.184
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:06.734
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:14.044
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:22.234
So, first of all, He did was to create

00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:26.004
the power of Adi Shakti.

00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:32.544
When It was created then there was a sound,

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:36.604
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:39.024
by the primordial sound,

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:43.284
and these three powers came out of that sound -

00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:49.004
is A, U and M -Aum.

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:53.824
The Adi Shakti is the One

00:01:54.024 --> 00:02:01.304
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:09.004
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

00:02:09.204 --> 00:02:15.764
and for His own expression,

00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:19.284
for His own manifestation,

00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:23.604
for His own reflection.

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:29.504
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:34.604
so He must have thought of creating a partner

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:40.274
who will manifest His desires.

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:50.284
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:56.794
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:02.274
His desire to create.

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:07.014
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

00:03:07.214 --> 00:03:11.654
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:15.684
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

00:03:15.884 --> 00:03:21.874
The attention has its own joy

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:26.684
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:30.044
She created all the universes,

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:34.954
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:40.644
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:44.404
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:44.604 --> 00:03:50.994
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

00:03:52.404 --> 00:03:55.124
At this juncture one may ask that,

00:03:55.334 --> 00:04:00.494
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

00:04:01.044 --> 00:04:03.904
That was the idea of God Almighty,

00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:10.814
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:17.294
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

00:04:17.564 --> 00:04:20.304
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:24.464
She had Her own way of expression,

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:28.394
that She thought She must create the mirrors

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:34.034
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:35.884
to see His character

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:41.854
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

00:04:44.124 --> 00:04:48.454
This evolution had to work out this way

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:54.284
because they had to know from where they come.

00:04:54.524 --> 00:05:00.714
We must know that we come from nature.

00:05:00.914 --> 00:05:06.614
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

00:05:06.824 --> 00:05:11.674
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:17.734
And She too is not just a dead earth,

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:22.474
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:28.294
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:35.484
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

00:05:35.684 --> 00:05:41.424
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:46.264
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:50.664
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

00:05:50.864 --> 00:05:54.804
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:57.384
See the whole plan that was made.

00:05:57.584 --> 00:06:03.014
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:07.974
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

00:06:08.174 --> 00:06:11.164
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

00:06:11.364 --> 00:06:13.684
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

00:06:13.884 --> 00:06:17.404
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:23.494
This is the power that does all the living work,

00:06:23.694 --> 00:06:29.714
all the organization, all the creation.

00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:39.544
In our human ego we start thinking that

00:06:39.744 --> 00:06:43.594
we do something, we can create.

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:50.094
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

00:06:50.294 --> 00:06:52.674
leave alone anything else.

00:06:52.874 --> 00:06:57.944
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

00:06:58.144 --> 00:07:03.644
we can put together and create something,

00:07:03.844 --> 00:07:13.224
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:18.304
any power.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.544
We cannot create anything.

00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:29.514
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

00:07:29.714 --> 00:07:35.124
For example, something is made of gold.

00:07:35.324 --> 00:07:38.454
Still it is gold.

00:07:38.654 --> 00:07:41.794
Now something is made of wood,

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:46.394
whatever it is made, is wood.

00:07:46.594 --> 00:07:50.164
The principle is the same into everything.

00:07:50.364 --> 00:07:55.084
So whatever may be your birth,

00:07:55.284 --> 00:07:58.164
whatever may be the country you are born,

00:07:58.364 --> 00:08:04.904
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

00:08:05.104 --> 00:08:08.724
basically you all are the same.

00:08:08.924 --> 00:08:14.364
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

00:08:14.564 --> 00:08:18.774
also, you cry the same way.

00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:22.644
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

00:08:22.844 --> 00:08:27.504
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

00:08:28.588 --> 00:08:33.634
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:38.494
by some common principle of life.

00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:44.104
And the common principle of life that has bound us

00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:51.154
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

00:08:51.354 --> 00:08:54.064
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

00:08:54.264 --> 00:08:56.514
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

00:08:56.714 --> 00:09:00.854
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:10.134
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

00:09:10.334 --> 00:09:13.614
But in the human form only

00:09:13.814 --> 00:09:20.754
it has evolved as a connection,

00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:26.344
as one that is the divine force within us,

00:09:26.544 --> 00:09:31.844
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:37.994
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:41.554
This is the common principle we all have.

00:09:41.754 --> 00:09:49.054
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

00:09:49.254 --> 00:09:54.234
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

00:09:54.444 --> 00:10:01.364
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

00:10:01.944 --> 00:10:04.514
Then there are people, as you people are,

00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:09.524
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.694
who have got your realization.

00:10:12.894 --> 00:10:17.114
So when you understand that this is the

00:10:17.314 --> 00:10:24.254
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

00:10:24.454 --> 00:10:28.034
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:29.924
and the enjoyment.

00:10:30.124 --> 00:10:39.864
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:43.624
what should happen to you?

00:10:43.824 --> 00:10:48.274
What should we feel?

00:10:48.474 --> 00:10:54.564
How do we then exist?

00:10:55.284 --> 00:11:00.574
This is the question many a times you have asked.

00:11:00.934 --> 00:11:04.434
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

00:11:04.634 --> 00:11:06.064
that you are not there,

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:10.194
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

00:11:10.394 --> 00:11:12.364
Secondly, what happens to you

00:11:12.564 --> 00:11:17.284
is that you become just the existence.

00:11:17.484 --> 00:11:20.244
Just the existence.

00:11:20.444 --> 00:11:22.994
And that existence that you become,

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:28.554
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

00:11:29.074 --> 00:11:34.174
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

00:11:34.374 --> 00:11:36.214
also much before.

00:11:36.414 --> 00:11:38.924
In every religion we have had people

00:11:39.124 --> 00:11:43.594
who had this divine character very well developed.

00:11:43.794 --> 00:11:48.944
For example, even you can say,

00:11:49.144 --> 00:11:56.114
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

00:11:56.314 --> 00:12:03.184
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:05.854
and a khumba also,

00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:08.934
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

00:12:09.134 --> 00:12:15.734
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:20.544
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

00:12:20.744 --> 00:12:25.684
You know that there is this power within us.

00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:31.254
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

00:12:31.464 --> 00:12:36.894
from the middle path of our ascent.

00:12:37.094 --> 00:12:39.724
Here also the same Kundalini,

00:12:39.924 --> 00:12:45.130
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

00:12:45.544 --> 00:12:52.004
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:57.014
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

00:12:57.214 --> 00:13:01.504
So now when we are enlightened people,

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:06.884
we have become saints and we are above all others,

00:13:07.084 --> 00:13:14.154
what should we do is to understand fully well -

00:13:14.354 --> 00:13:17.464
not only mentally, but from your heart -

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:23.774
that now you have got these divine vibrations

00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:29.064
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

00:13:29.264 --> 00:13:34.504
what are you, where is the problem.

00:13:34.704 --> 00:13:37.624
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

00:13:37.824 --> 00:13:42.354
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

00:13:42.554 --> 00:13:45.924
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

00:13:46.124 --> 00:13:49.504
with spiritual vibrations."

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:52.114
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

00:13:52.314 --> 00:13:54.274
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

00:13:54.474 --> 00:13:58.664
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

00:13:58.864 --> 00:14:02.904
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

00:14:03.104 --> 00:14:05.014
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

00:14:05.214 --> 00:14:07.104
from here only there are vibrations,

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:09.674
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

00:14:09.874 --> 00:14:12.244
So then he sat down and started wondering,

00:14:12.444 --> 00:14:17.494
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

00:14:17.694 --> 00:14:23.404
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

00:14:23.604 --> 00:14:27.434
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

00:14:27.644 --> 00:14:31.544
and that's how he found the place.

00:14:31.944 --> 00:14:34.214
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:37.324
is not done haphazard, in any way.

00:14:37.524 --> 00:14:40.694
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:47.024
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

00:14:47.604 --> 00:14:53.044
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

00:14:53.464 --> 00:14:55.794
We are the ones which spoil the nature

00:14:55.994 --> 00:15:00.294
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:02.594
and we have to respect it.

00:15:02.794 --> 00:15:04.884
I've already told you many a times

00:15:05.084 --> 00:15:07.974
about how human beings were formed

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:15.124
by different chemicals who came also,

00:15:15.324 --> 00:15:18.384
carbon came from the mother earth.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.824
All this leads us to understand

00:15:22.024 --> 00:15:26.674
that we have a very big responsibility.

00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:33.224
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:36.134
And now you all have reached a state

00:15:36.334 --> 00:15:40.274
where you have become yourself.

00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:42.624
You know yourself.

00:15:42.824 --> 00:15:46.874
This is a very big, I think should say,

00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:54.384
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

00:15:56.754 --> 00:16:03.504
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

00:16:32.974 --> 00:16:38.384
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

00:16:38.584 --> 00:16:45.704
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:55.584
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

00:16:57.024 --> 00:17:02.074
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

00:17:02.274 --> 00:17:06.004
and these centers have to be awakened

00:17:06.204 --> 00:17:09.704
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:17.684
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:27.474
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

00:17:27.674 --> 00:17:32.404
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

00:17:32.604 --> 00:17:38.534
from the path of your perfection.

00:17:39.634 --> 00:17:43.074
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

00:17:43.274 --> 00:17:47.784
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

00:17:47.994 --> 00:17:51.904
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:56.724
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

00:17:56.924 --> 00:18:01.684
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

00:18:01.994 --> 00:18:05.774
There are so many ways of people relating

00:18:05.974 --> 00:18:09.634
to the power of the Divine.

00:18:09.844 --> 00:18:14.124
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

00:18:14.324 --> 00:18:19.794
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

00:18:19.994 --> 00:18:23.174
and through Her the whole universe was created.

00:18:23.374 --> 00:18:31.114
But also true that as you are seeking,

00:18:31.324 --> 00:18:34.564
also the Divine is seeking you.

00:18:34.764 --> 00:18:43.114
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

00:18:43.314 --> 00:18:50.874
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

00:18:51.074 --> 00:18:56.834
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

00:18:57.034 --> 00:19:01.004
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

00:19:01.204 --> 00:19:04.174
It is the One which has given you

00:19:04.374 --> 00:19:07.354
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

00:19:07.554 --> 00:19:11.904
"Whatever we have is given by You".

00:19:12.224 --> 00:19:16.614
If that is the case that all that you have

00:19:16.814 --> 00:19:21.264
is given by your Kundalini,

00:19:21.474 --> 00:19:25.164
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:30.124
then is very important to understand what is the need

00:19:30.374 --> 00:19:37.994
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:46.964
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

00:19:48.394 --> 00:19:51.574
As I said, there's a relationship

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:58.304
between the realized souls and the Divine.

00:19:58.504 --> 00:20:02.364
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

00:20:02.574 --> 00:20:08.234
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

00:20:08.434 --> 00:20:11.874
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

00:20:12.074 --> 00:20:14.924
It's such a relationship.

00:20:15.124 --> 00:20:18.254
And it's so close, it's so close,

00:20:18.454 --> 00:20:23.714
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

00:20:23.914 --> 00:20:30.814
or the moon has its own moonlight.

00:20:31.014 --> 00:20:42.244
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

00:20:42.444 --> 00:20:47.664
and that should give you full control over yourself

00:20:47.864 --> 00:20:53.204
and over your development.

00:20:53.704 --> 00:21:01.254
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

00:21:02.114 --> 00:21:05.874
Now

00:21:11.469 --> 00:21:16.604
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

00:21:16.824 --> 00:21:19.534
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:21.134
you may.

00:21:21.344 --> 00:21:23.274
But as soon as that person will disappear,

00:21:23.474 --> 00:21:26.574
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

00:21:26.774 --> 00:21:30.044
That surrender has no meaning.

00:21:30.244 --> 00:21:36.474
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

00:21:36.674 --> 00:21:40.604
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

00:21:40.814 --> 00:21:44.394
because it has a reaction.

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:52.614
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

00:21:52.844 --> 00:22:08.714
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

00:22:08.914 --> 00:22:14.614
into the water automatically,

00:22:14.814 --> 00:22:22.554
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

00:22:23.154 --> 00:22:27.594
If you can just feel that within yourself,

00:22:27.794 --> 00:22:30.984
that you are one with the Divine.

00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:36.274
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

00:22:36.774 --> 00:22:46.644
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

00:22:46.854 --> 00:22:53.244
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

00:22:53.444 --> 00:23:00.424
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

00:23:01.054 --> 00:23:06.404
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

00:23:06.604 --> 00:23:10.444
There's a great joy in forgiving,

00:23:10.644 --> 00:23:15.164
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

00:23:15.364 --> 00:23:21.664
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:25.774
Nobody can disturb you.

00:23:25.974 --> 00:23:30.424
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

00:23:30.624 --> 00:23:32.864
that is what is forgiveness.

00:23:33.064 --> 00:23:37.584
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

00:23:37.784 --> 00:23:40.524
or to do something against somebody.

00:23:40.724 --> 00:23:44.714
The Divine takes over from you

00:23:44.914 --> 00:23:47.814
and does whatever is needed,

00:23:48.014 --> 00:23:54.684
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

00:23:55.084 --> 00:24:00.244
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

00:24:00.444 --> 00:24:02.684
say in Islam called ruh;

00:24:02.884 --> 00:24:07.664
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

00:24:07.864 --> 00:24:12.044
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

00:24:12.244 --> 00:24:18.004
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

00:24:18.204 --> 00:24:22.804
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

00:24:23.004 --> 00:24:26.564
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

00:24:26.764 --> 00:24:32.324
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

00:24:32.524 --> 00:24:37.484
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

00:24:37.694 --> 00:24:40.024
how to make others feel it.

00:24:40.224 --> 00:24:43.714
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

00:24:43.914 --> 00:24:45.964
or something nonsensical.

00:24:46.164 --> 00:24:49.944
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

00:24:50.144 --> 00:24:56.064
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

00:24:56.264 --> 00:25:02.104
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

00:25:02.304 --> 00:25:06.384
that you know there is this Power.

00:25:06.584 --> 00:25:08.934
You're sure about this Power

00:25:09.134 --> 00:25:13.314
because you can feel it within yourself.

00:25:13.514 --> 00:25:16.454
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

00:25:16.664 --> 00:25:22.834
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

00:25:23.034 --> 00:25:28.644
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

00:25:28.844 --> 00:25:38.174
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

00:25:38.384 --> 00:25:41.614
She tells you the truth.

00:25:43.664 --> 00:25:48.654
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

00:25:48.854 --> 00:25:53.494
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

00:25:53.694 --> 00:25:57.454
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

00:25:57.664 --> 00:26:02.884
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

00:26:03.084 --> 00:26:05.434
This kind of argument is possible.

00:26:05.634 --> 00:26:08.354
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

00:26:08.554 --> 00:26:11.224
that you forgive that person,

00:26:11.424 --> 00:26:16.014
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

00:26:16.214 --> 00:26:19.034
you don't do anything.

00:26:19.234 --> 00:26:20.714
That's the truth.

00:26:20.924 --> 00:26:25.464
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

00:26:25.664 --> 00:26:29.124
compassion becomes the truth.

00:26:29.324 --> 00:26:33.004
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

00:26:33.204 --> 00:26:36.344
So all the absolute truth that you know is

00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:41.184
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

00:26:41.384 --> 00:26:46.094
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

00:26:46.294 --> 00:26:49.464
and we felt this way and still it happened."

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:52.604
It makes no difference.

00:26:52.804 --> 00:26:55.664
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:59.904
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

00:27:00.104 --> 00:27:04.334
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

00:27:04.534 --> 00:27:09.154
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

00:27:09.354 --> 00:27:12.754
Because it had to be the other way round.

00:27:12.954 --> 00:27:16.364
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

00:27:16.574 --> 00:27:21.394
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

00:27:21.594 --> 00:27:24.294
So, it's a play going on.

00:27:24.494 --> 00:27:30.754
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

00:27:30.964 --> 00:27:39.704
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

00:27:39.904 --> 00:27:45.214
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:49.884
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

00:27:50.084 --> 00:27:53.994
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

00:27:54.194 --> 00:28:01.724
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

00:28:02.004 --> 00:28:10.564
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

00:28:11.044 --> 00:28:13.694
When you have the enlightened faith,

00:28:13.894 --> 00:28:20.424
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

00:28:20.624 --> 00:28:26.464
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

00:28:26.954 --> 00:28:31.784
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

00:28:31.984 --> 00:28:37.664
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:41.444
Not necessarily. It's a play.

00:28:41.644 --> 00:28:49.534
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

00:28:49.734 --> 00:28:53.074
So if you can become the witness,

00:28:53.274 --> 00:28:56.844
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

00:28:57.044 --> 00:29:04.454
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

00:29:04.924 --> 00:29:10.644
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

00:29:10.844 --> 00:29:13.704
That dissolution has to take place.

00:29:13.904 --> 00:29:17.624
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

00:29:17.824 --> 00:29:23.364
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

00:29:23.564 --> 00:29:27.664
this work could not have been done.

00:29:27.874 --> 00:29:32.924
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

00:29:33.124 --> 00:29:45.024
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

00:29:45.234 --> 00:29:49.094
all the aspects of this human life.

00:29:49.294 --> 00:29:52.864
It had to be such an Incarnation

00:29:53.064 --> 00:30:01.054
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

00:30:01.254 --> 00:30:05.574
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

00:30:05.774 --> 00:30:13.404
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:16.634
as a whole, as a human being.

00:30:16.834 --> 00:30:21.164
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

00:30:21.364 --> 00:30:24.684
all of them are just the same.

00:30:24.894 --> 00:30:34.054
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

00:30:34.254 --> 00:30:38.134
some are not seeking genuinely,

00:30:38.334 --> 00:30:41.784
and some are not seeking at all.

00:30:41.984 --> 00:30:46.874
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

00:30:47.084 --> 00:30:52.924
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

00:30:53.124 --> 00:30:57.694
one fish came out of the mother.

00:30:57.894 --> 00:31:04.864
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

00:31:05.064 --> 00:31:10.384
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

00:31:10.584 --> 00:31:15.614
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

00:31:16.014 --> 00:31:22.724
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

00:31:23.224 --> 00:31:27.594
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

00:31:27.794 --> 00:31:31.604
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

00:31:31.804 --> 00:31:34.414
James or what St. John has said,

00:31:34.614 --> 00:31:37.464
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

00:31:37.654 --> 00:31:39.214
It doesn't matter.

00:31:39.414 --> 00:31:47.084
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

00:31:47.294 --> 00:31:51.264
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

00:31:51.464 --> 00:31:56.274
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

00:31:56.474 --> 00:32:01.694
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

00:32:01.894 --> 00:32:05.894
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

00:32:06.094 --> 00:32:08.874
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

00:32:09.074 --> 00:32:13.134
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

00:32:13.334 --> 00:32:17.294
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

00:32:17.494 --> 00:32:19.474
should not disturb you much

00:32:19.674 --> 00:32:24.224
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

00:32:24.424 --> 00:32:28.274
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

00:32:28.474 --> 00:32:32.814
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

00:32:33.014 --> 00:32:38.864
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

00:32:39.064 --> 00:32:43.054
all the useless things that we have,

00:32:43.254 --> 00:32:46.624
like our conditioning and our ego.

00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:49.854
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:50.054 --> 00:32:53.774
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

00:32:53.974 --> 00:32:57.844
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

00:32:58.044 --> 00:33:02.284
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

00:33:02.484 --> 00:33:04.224
That's human nature also.

00:33:04.424 --> 00:33:08.064
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

00:33:08.264 --> 00:33:11.794
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

00:33:11.994 --> 00:33:15.574
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

00:33:15.774 --> 00:33:20.234
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

00:33:20.434 --> 00:33:22.374
It will all work out.

00:33:22.574 --> 00:33:26.794
It will all work out, but your attention should be

00:33:26.994 --> 00:33:34.164
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

00:33:34.364 --> 00:33:36.984
of this compassion?".

00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:42.514
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

00:33:42.714 --> 00:33:46.244
which is going to give you strength.

00:33:46.444 --> 00:33:49.474
This compassion within you,

00:33:49.674 --> 00:33:53.254
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

00:33:53.454 --> 00:33:56.734
completely destroyed,

00:33:56.934 --> 00:34:00.734
your compassion itself will make you powerful

00:34:00.934 --> 00:34:05.194
and you'll do everything that is needed.

00:34:05.394 --> 00:34:09.724
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

00:34:09.924 --> 00:34:18.094
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

00:34:18.364 --> 00:34:21.004
And amazingly as you will do this,

00:34:21.204 --> 00:34:25.994
your own level of spirituality will rise.

00:34:27.874 --> 00:34:30.824
As you see, I would say,

00:34:31.024 --> 00:34:36.324
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

00:34:36.524 --> 00:34:38.874
the water rises.

00:34:39.074 --> 00:34:45.144
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:45.344 --> 00:34:49.124
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

00:34:49.324 --> 00:34:53.734
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

00:34:53.934 --> 00:34:56.284
there will be much more manifestation

00:34:56.484 --> 00:35:02.724
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

00:35:03.084 --> 00:35:09.604
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

00:35:09.804 --> 00:35:12.314
you all have got your Realization

00:35:12.514 --> 00:35:16.914
and that you are all now saintly people,

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:20.514
then we should see to people who were like you.

00:35:20.714 --> 00:35:24.704
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

00:35:24.904 --> 00:35:28.744
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

00:35:28.944 --> 00:35:34.334
What did they do? They went all out

00:35:34.534 --> 00:35:38.704
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

00:35:38.904 --> 00:35:40.984
They could not give realization as such,

00:35:41.184 --> 00:35:43.694
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

00:35:43.894 --> 00:35:48.294
they talked about it, they sang about it.

00:35:48.494 --> 00:35:51.674
That's what we have to understand

00:35:51.904 --> 00:36:01.024
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

00:36:01.224 --> 00:36:03.514
When you know the people are getting drowned,

00:36:03.714 --> 00:36:08.984
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

00:36:09.184 --> 00:36:14.944
I should say,

00:36:15.144 --> 00:36:20.804
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

00:36:21.014 --> 00:36:24.054
And if you have that compassion within you,

00:36:24.264 --> 00:36:29.304
you will go all out to save them.

00:36:29.504 --> 00:36:35.464
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

00:36:35.664 --> 00:36:40.534
of this enjoyment of your attention.

00:36:40.734 --> 00:36:44.044
Your attention itself will enjoy

00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:53.384
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

00:36:53.584 --> 00:36:56.614
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

00:36:56.814 --> 00:37:00.134
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

00:37:00.334 --> 00:37:05.984
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

00:37:06.184 --> 00:37:12.494
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

00:37:12.694 --> 00:37:15.174
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

00:37:15.374 --> 00:37:19.944
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

00:37:20.144 --> 00:37:26.434
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

00:37:26.634 --> 00:37:31.734
The more you use this power the better it will be.

00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:36.854
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:41.044
For we haven't got many people from the black race

00:37:41.244 --> 00:37:43.174
I think, from Africa.

00:37:43.374 --> 00:37:47.704
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

00:37:47.904 --> 00:37:51.104
Also, we have so many other areas

00:37:51.304 --> 00:37:54.534
where I find we have to work it out,

00:37:54.734 --> 00:38:01.394
that if this compassion is within you

00:38:01.594 --> 00:38:03.934
then it will compel you, also,

00:38:04.134 --> 00:38:07.844
to do work that will bring solace to people

00:38:08.044 --> 00:38:10.764
who are not even seeking.

00:38:10.964 --> 00:38:16.104
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

00:38:16.304 --> 00:38:21.534
which will really create very beautiful institutions

00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:26.404
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:30.644
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

00:38:30.844 --> 00:38:35.484
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:38:35.684 --> 00:38:40.934
you have dropped out your greed,

00:38:41.134 --> 00:38:47.144
you have dropped out your lust.

00:38:47.344 --> 00:38:52.314
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

00:38:52.524 --> 00:38:56.224
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

00:38:56.424 --> 00:38:59.864
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

00:39:00.064 --> 00:39:01.954
and then they start becoming leaders,

00:39:02.154 --> 00:39:07.854
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:10.914
This you will not do.

00:39:11.114 --> 00:39:18.144
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

00:39:18.344 --> 00:39:24.574
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

00:39:24.774 --> 00:39:31.014
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

00:39:31.214 --> 00:39:35.284
Once we start spreading out like that,

00:39:35.484 --> 00:39:38.354
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

00:39:38.564 --> 00:39:41.584
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

00:39:41.784 --> 00:39:48.414
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

00:39:48.614 --> 00:39:52.244
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

00:39:52.444 --> 00:39:54.344
who don't have greed.

00:39:54.544 --> 00:39:57.484
I have known people who never had any greed,

00:39:57.684 --> 00:40:03.364
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

00:40:03.564 --> 00:40:06.874
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:10.674
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

00:40:10.874 --> 00:40:14.304
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

00:40:14.504 --> 00:40:16.934
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:17.134 --> 00:40:19.364
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

00:40:19.564 --> 00:40:25.434
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

00:40:25.634 --> 00:40:28.784
Not their lust, not their greed

00:40:28.984 --> 00:40:32.704
and also the so-called deviations

00:40:32.904 --> 00:40:39.524
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:42.454
Because they know what do they enjoy,

00:40:42.654 --> 00:40:45.044
where lies their enjoyment.

00:40:45.244 --> 00:40:47.644
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

00:40:47.844 --> 00:40:51.454
you will try to have more of it

00:40:51.654 --> 00:40:56.464
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

00:40:56.664 --> 00:40:59.574
I would say as the men are working it out,

00:40:59.774 --> 00:41:01.514
women should work it out

00:41:01.714 --> 00:41:07.074
because women have more sense of compassion,

00:41:07.274 --> 00:41:11.624
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

00:41:11.824 --> 00:41:14.824
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

00:41:15.024 --> 00:41:17.914
I'm saying about normal.

00:41:18.114 --> 00:41:23.374
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

00:41:23.574 --> 00:41:28.074
they have known what is love for the children is.

00:41:28.274 --> 00:41:30.034
Mother doesn't expect anything.

00:41:30.234 --> 00:41:33.914
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

00:41:34.114 --> 00:41:37.114
She enjoys her child, that's all.

00:41:37.314 --> 00:41:44.134
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

00:41:44.344 --> 00:41:46.294
See, I have seen young girls.

00:41:46.494 --> 00:41:49.894
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

00:41:50.104 --> 00:41:53.534
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

00:41:53.734 --> 00:41:58.354
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

00:41:58.564 --> 00:42:04.694
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

00:42:04.894 --> 00:42:09.034
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

00:42:09.244 --> 00:42:13.534
And as you are all married also,

00:42:13.734 --> 00:42:18.744
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

00:42:18.944 --> 00:42:25.674
by your own nature of Divinity.

00:42:25.874 --> 00:42:27.994
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

00:42:28.204 --> 00:42:32.084
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

00:42:32.284 --> 00:42:36.124
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

00:42:36.324 --> 00:42:39.774
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:43.524
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

00:42:43.724 --> 00:42:46.754
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

00:42:46.954 --> 00:42:54.634
And if something

00:42:54.834 --> 00:42:57.134
has to be done, has to be done.

00:42:57.334 --> 00:42:59.514
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

00:42:59.714 --> 00:43:03.264
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

00:43:03.464 --> 00:43:06.644
and the household and this and that".

00:43:06.844 --> 00:43:10.444
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

00:43:10.444 --> 00:43:13.174
The whole day, what will you do?

00:43:13.374 --> 00:43:16.924
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

00:43:17.124 --> 00:43:20.974
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

00:43:21.174 --> 00:43:25.394
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

00:43:25.594 --> 00:43:30.544
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

00:43:30.744 --> 00:43:36.394
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

00:43:36.594 --> 00:43:44.764
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

00:43:44.964 --> 00:43:48.904
then you'll be never tired.

00:43:49.104 --> 00:43:51.944
You will never grudge.

00:43:52.144 --> 00:43:57.404
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

00:43:57.854 --> 00:44:01.644
This is a very important point that we should realize

00:44:01.844 --> 00:44:05.144
that if somebody is a woman or a man

00:44:05.344 --> 00:44:11.254
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

00:44:11.454 --> 00:44:16.294
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

00:44:16.494 --> 00:44:20.864
She has more power of compassion.

00:44:21.064 --> 00:44:24.384
In the same way the man has more power of action.

00:44:24.594 --> 00:44:27.584
So, the compassion has to become active.

00:44:27.784 --> 00:44:30.844
In this combination everything will work out

00:44:31.054 --> 00:44:33.324
in a very beautiful manner.

00:44:33.524 --> 00:44:38.304
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

00:44:38.504 --> 00:44:43.274
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

00:44:43.474 --> 00:44:46.534
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

00:44:46.734 --> 00:44:48.714
some of the women have been men

00:44:48.914 --> 00:44:53.564
and some of the men have been women.

00:44:53.764 --> 00:44:58.134
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

00:44:58.344 --> 00:45:04.064
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

00:45:04.264 --> 00:45:05.684
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:05.884 --> 00:45:08.424
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

00:45:08.624 --> 00:45:11.324
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

00:45:11.534 --> 00:45:13.324
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:13.534 --> 00:45:16.334
Now here you should understand the relationship

00:45:16.544 --> 00:45:20.844
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

00:45:21.044 --> 00:45:27.014
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:29.514
God Almighty is the Spectator;

00:45:29.714 --> 00:45:34.474
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:45:34.674 --> 00:45:37.084
She is compassion, of course.

00:45:37.284 --> 00:45:41.064
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

00:45:41.264 --> 00:45:44.684
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

00:45:44.884 --> 00:45:48.984
But He's the One who takes charge.

00:45:49.184 --> 00:45:54.224
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

00:45:54.424 --> 00:45:58.494
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

00:45:58.694 --> 00:46:03.594
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

00:46:03.804 --> 00:46:07.094
how it has worked out.

00:46:07.294 --> 00:46:11.344
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

00:46:11.544 --> 00:46:15.614
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

00:46:15.814 --> 00:46:20.304
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

00:46:20.504 --> 00:46:25.834
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

00:46:26.034 --> 00:46:27.804
I can't understand

00:46:28.004 --> 00:46:31.844
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

00:46:32.054 --> 00:46:38.724
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

00:46:38.924 --> 00:46:42.724
who knows what is the truth,

00:46:42.924 --> 00:46:51.824
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

00:46:52.024 --> 00:47:01.014
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

00:47:02.704 --> 00:47:06.424
It is to realize

00:47:06.624 --> 00:47:14.874
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

00:47:15.174 --> 00:47:19.114
You have entered into His kingdom

00:47:19.314 --> 00:47:25.654
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

00:47:25.854 --> 00:47:29.124
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

00:47:29.324 --> 00:47:32.004
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

00:47:32.204 --> 00:47:35.884
he still begs sitting on this throne.

00:47:36.084 --> 00:47:39.884
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:40.084 --> 00:47:42.754
I receive some funny letters sometimes

00:47:42.954 --> 00:47:47.494
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

00:47:47.694 --> 00:47:52.964
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

00:47:53.164 --> 00:47:59.064
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

00:47:59.274 --> 00:48:01.634
because it has a very bad impression,

00:48:01.834 --> 00:48:07.084
also, for other people and for your own life.

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:10.924
For your own life, is very important

00:48:11.124 --> 00:48:15.304
that you should grow fully into the understanding

00:48:15.504 --> 00:48:21.434
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

00:48:21.634 --> 00:48:25.704
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

00:48:25.904 --> 00:48:30.034
What do you have to surrender?

00:48:31.604 --> 00:48:34.474
Just think of it.

00:48:34.674 --> 00:48:42.004
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

00:48:42.204 --> 00:48:48.314
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

00:48:48.514 --> 00:48:55.094
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

00:48:55.294 --> 00:49:00.084
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

00:49:00.284 --> 00:49:05.074
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

00:49:05.274 --> 00:49:08.324
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

00:49:08.524 --> 00:49:10.064
Impossible.

00:49:10.264 --> 00:49:15.334
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

00:49:15.534 --> 00:49:18.104
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

00:49:18.304 --> 00:49:21.514
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

00:49:21.714 --> 00:49:28.234
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

00:49:28.434 --> 00:49:32.254
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

00:49:32.454 --> 00:49:38.794
have to enter into and work out.

00:49:38.994 --> 00:49:40.514
You can do it.

00:49:40.714 --> 00:49:45.974
You see, I was surprised that in this place

00:49:46.174 --> 00:49:51.364
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

00:49:51.564 --> 00:49:55.994
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

00:49:56.194 --> 00:49:59.234
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

00:49:59.434 --> 00:50:06.254
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

00:50:06.454 --> 00:50:12.034
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

00:50:12.234 --> 00:50:15.284
As it is growing in quantity,

00:50:15.484 --> 00:50:19.194
it should also grow in quality.

00:50:19.394 --> 00:50:24.254
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:26.564
Because I know all the time

00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:29.614
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

00:50:29.814 --> 00:50:33.094
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:50:33.294 --> 00:50:37.444
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

00:50:37.644 --> 00:50:39.654
I know that feeling you have that,

00:50:39.854 --> 00:50:43.284
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

00:50:43.484 --> 00:50:45.354
So forget about them.

00:50:45.564 --> 00:50:52.284
But those who are seeking, approach them.

00:50:52.494 --> 00:50:54.644
They are your real relations.

00:50:54.844 --> 00:50:58.754
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

00:50:58.954 --> 00:51:02.654
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

00:51:02.854 --> 00:51:05.894
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

00:51:06.094 --> 00:51:10.294
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

00:51:10.494 --> 00:51:14.234
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

00:51:14.434 --> 00:51:17.144
You should find out where are they.

00:51:17.344 --> 00:51:20.054
My attention is, of course, is with you

00:51:20.254 --> 00:51:25.034
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

00:51:25.244 --> 00:51:26.644
Whatever you want,

00:51:26.844 --> 00:51:31.334
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

00:51:31.534 --> 00:51:36.894
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

00:51:37.104 --> 00:51:40.114
Because you take it upon yourself.

00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:45.854
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

00:51:46.054 --> 00:51:53.214
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

00:51:53.424 --> 00:51:59.984
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

00:52:00.704 --> 00:52:03.934
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

00:52:04.134 --> 00:52:07.974
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

00:52:08.174 --> 00:52:12.164
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

00:52:12.374 --> 00:52:15.414
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

00:52:15.624 --> 00:52:17.814
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

00:52:18.014 --> 00:52:21.014
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

00:52:21.214 --> 00:52:22.704
is Adi Shakti.

00:52:22.904 --> 00:52:26.204
It's very important that this puja must be performed

00:52:26.404 --> 00:52:32.474
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

00:52:32.674 --> 00:52:35.634
and you grow more and more within yourself

00:52:35.834 --> 00:52:40.564
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

00:52:40.764 --> 00:52:45.564
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

00:52:45.764 --> 00:52:48.244
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

00:52:48.444 --> 00:52:52.274
within you is the Kundalini.

00:52:52.474 --> 00:52:53.724
So, you have to worship.

00:52:53.924 --> 00:52:58.084
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

00:52:58.284 --> 00:53:01.654
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

00:53:01.854 --> 00:53:05.354
May God bless you.
