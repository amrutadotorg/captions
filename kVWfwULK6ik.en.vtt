00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[...] means you have known Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:17.280
Also many of you are realized souls and many of&nbsp;
you have achieved a great height within yourself.&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:28.320
And many of you have assumed&nbsp;
the divine grace, its working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:49.720
its maneuvering and its manifestation very well.
It was to be so; it had to work out that way.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:59.400
Human beings have to evolve.
They have to evolve, it’s God’s plan, slow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.760
no doubt, because it’s a living process.
It’s nothing artificial.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.880
It has to happen within you.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.800
Today only as I told you that even if&nbsp;
you may know about Sahaja Yoga, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:29.920
may know a lot about it, but you have&nbsp;
to become, becoming is the problem.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.600
Because there are many Sahaja Yogis&nbsp;
today and very few new people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.400
first I will of course tell something about&nbsp;
Sahaj Yog and then I would like to tell you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:58.400
how to become, that is very important.
New phase must start in Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.720
The first thing is what is Sahaj Yoga is.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.640
Sahaja Yoga means ‘born with you’.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.320
‘Saha’ means with, ‘ja’ means born.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.200
This right to unite with God is born with you.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.840
As soon as you are born a human&nbsp;
being this right you have.&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.360
And that is why human beings are seeking.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.480
They are somehow aware of that right.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.560
Now we have many books.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.840
We can call them the holy scriptures,&nbsp;
those who have talked about kingdom of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.760
they have talked about All-pervading power.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.120
They have talked about God Almighty.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.560
They have talked about Holy Ghost.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.280
As in Sanskrit language we call it ‘Adi Shakti’.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:28.400
All of them have talked about your&nbsp;
rebirth that you are to be born again.&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:39.600
But with the advent of science we&nbsp;
just felt that this is all unknown.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.840
To begin with, it was treated as something very&nbsp;
unknown, very difficult, the union with God.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.600
But God was not denied.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.720
But as the science started growing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:06.680
the thinking mind was lost in the moorings&nbsp;
and it started believing there is no God.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.440
It hurt them a little to believe in that.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.840
But whether you believe in God&nbsp;
or not, it makes no difference.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.640
There are people who have ardently believed&nbsp;
in God, who have been mad after God,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.440
who went to lunatic asylum thinking of&nbsp;
God, so many things have happened to them.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.680
Of course, there are many scientists&nbsp;
also who went to lunatic asylum.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.640
So, what was missing?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.560
This was the waiting period.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:56.600
And you had to choose the right and the wrong with&nbsp;
your own awareness, with your own understanding.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.080
That had to be because you had to grow up to a&nbsp;
point, your maturity has to come up to a point.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.000
Your awareness had to reach a certain state.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.800
You had to wait.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.960
There is all-pervading power and there is God.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.360
But you are not yet connected.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.000
If you are not yet connected&nbsp;
everything is just a story.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.360
Is so artificial.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.920
It has no meaning.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.960
It was to happen during modern times.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.960
It is all predestined.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.040
Of course, the results are fantastic.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:51.280
But it was to happen, that thousands are&nbsp;
to be connected with that divine power.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.720
But this is a living evolutionary process.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.960
This is born with you.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.640
This is within you.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.600
As you cannot become from monkey to human beings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.880
you cannot become higher than&nbsp;
human beings by yourself.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.600
Somebody has to do it.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.640
Somebody has to lead you.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.800
Christ had to come on this Earth.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.600
Krishna had to come on this Earth.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.560
Rama had to come on this Earth, just&nbsp;
to give you a push in your awareness.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.440
But the time of your culmination has come where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.640
you have to really jump into that&nbsp;
kingdom of God which is promised.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.840
But this is your right and for&nbsp;
this you don’t have to pay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.040
you don’t have to plot, you&nbsp;
don’t have to work hard.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.720
It’s in your own right you are going to get it.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.520
This is Sahaj Yoga.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:14.600
Now for the Sahaja Yogis who have got&nbsp;
Realization, in their own right again, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:22.720
it has worked with them, as soon as you get your&nbsp;
Realization you start understanding vibrations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.240
you start understanding the Kundalini,&nbsp;
you can raise the Kundalini yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.400
you can understand your own chakras, you&nbsp;
can understand the chakras of others.&nbsp;

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.880
You start understanding what is&nbsp;
vibratory awareness tells you.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.920
You have a new awareness within you.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.440
An actualization that has taken place in you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.840
by which you can recognize what&nbsp;
is right and what is wrong.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.880
A rapport is now established between you&nbsp;
and the Divine, you and the unconscious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.440
you and God, and you can get&nbsp;
answers for whatever you want.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:19.320
But still in the West we are more rational.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.160
Whatever we have found out so&nbsp;
far is by using our rationality.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.720
Our movement in life has been through our&nbsp;
rationality, through our thinking and the I.Q.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.320
is very high in this country.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.720
But in the East people have more of heart.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:47.040
They have used their heart for their&nbsp;
seeking, for solving their problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.840
while we have used our rationality in the West.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:03.920
Because of this the effects of Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga are felt in two different ways.&nbsp;

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:11.400
For example, for an Indian, when he gets his&nbsp;
Realization, if he is not westernized, if his I.Q.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:18.480
is not very high, of superlative degree you see,&nbsp;
or if he has not listened to your Mastermind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:29.360
programs, then, such a simple Indian gets it in&nbsp;
a very easy way, thousands of them can get it.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.760
And they immediately feel the joy,&nbsp;
because joy is the quality of heart.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:43.920
Is the quality of your&nbsp;
Spirit that it gives you joy.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:51.880
But with rationality, the mind that has moved&nbsp;
with rationality, the life that has lived with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.880 --> 00:10:00.080
rationality, is identified with rationality,&nbsp;
first gets the knowledge about Sahaja Yog.&nbsp;

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.120
You people are much more knowledgeable&nbsp;
about Sahaja Yoga than Indians are.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.840
For example, Gregoire’s book if you give it to&nbsp;
some Indian he’ll say, “Oh, it goes over my head.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.240
I don’t know why, what all this is about”
They just can’t read it.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.960
It’s too much.
They said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:24.240
“Sahaja Yoga is so simple, why should&nbsp;
there be such a long lecture about it?”

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.120
But for you it’s a treasure.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:38.560
That is how in the West first you&nbsp;
get the knowledge but not the joy.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.200
While they get the joy first&nbsp;
and then the knowledge.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.440
All these are the qualities of the Spirit.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:11:01.760
Your attention can enter into your awareness.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:13.440
That means when you get Realization, the&nbsp;
Spirit, you feel through your conscious mind.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.040
You start feeling the Spirit&nbsp;
through your conscious mind.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.640
You start feeling the vibrations&nbsp;
flowing through your hands.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.560
Your attention is enlightened,&nbsp;
means you see that the flow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:39.360
of vibration is recorded by your&nbsp;
nerves, by your central nervous system.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.240
They can feel the flow of the cool breeze.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:51.000
They can feel the rising of the Kundalini.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.240
This is the knowledge about the truth you&nbsp;
get, that there is Spirit which is emitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.160
these beautiful waves.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.960
So, when you grow, you grow&nbsp;
from knowledge towards joy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:22.880
while an Eastern person grows&nbsp;
from joy towards knowledge.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.160
That’s why the Sahaja Yogis of London are serious&nbsp;
people, you see: knowledge makes you very serious.&nbsp;

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.160
But joy, joy makes you like a&nbsp;
child, you live like a child.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:44.840
You don’t know how to become&nbsp;
serious, very difficult.&nbsp;

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.920
So how to grow is the problem&nbsp;
with the Western people.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.240
Now with the Eastern people I&nbsp;
will tell them something else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.320
but with you I have to tell you something else.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.120
You know that very well that&nbsp;
we have to tackle problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.600
which we face and not the&nbsp;
problems that others face.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.480
You see, is very common human venture that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.120
try to solve the problems that others are&nbsp;
facing and never see their own problems.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.480
So we have to face our problems that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:26.840
confronting us – when we are&nbsp;
Sahaja Yogis what happens?

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.000
We start getting knowledge and knowledge&nbsp;
and knowledge through vibrations.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.240
We start understanding about Chakras.&nbsp;

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.280
We start understanding as to what Mantras&nbsp;
to be said for particular Chakras.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.960
We also know how to maneuver the power.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:51.600
We also know how to save ourselves&nbsp;
and also know how to save others.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.560
We know how to cure others.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.600
We know all about medicines.
We can cure cancer.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.640
We can cure ourselves, we can cure others.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:11.280
And all this comes to us so easily.
Apart from that we understand the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:18.560
relationship between science and Sahaj Yog,&nbsp;
between economics and Sahaj Yog, between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:27.040
politics and Sahaj Yog, between physics and&nbsp;
Sahaj Yog, and between so many other branches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:33.440
of knowledge with Sahaj Yog, because they&nbsp;
are also part and parcel of human beings.&nbsp;

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.480
We start understanding psychology&nbsp;
through Sahaj Yog in a new way.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.040
We start understanding all&nbsp;
the scriptures of the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.440
because everything is enlightened,&nbsp;
and we understand Sahaj Yog.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:55.000
But we do not become fully&nbsp;
that, which we have to be.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.320
We do not fully manifest our Spirit.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:16.080
If so, we would be completely in joy.
The reason for that is very simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.920
that in the beginning when we start feeling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:29.080
vibrations, when you get the first&nbsp;
Realization, it’s in a very big way.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.480
You enjoy that experience.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:38.760
Then Kundalini starts going to other places to&nbsp;
supply, for example, to your brain to begin with.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.600
Because you have used your brain too much,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.840
and still you are using your&nbsp;
brain to know about Sahaj Yoga.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.560
I think in the beginning when&nbsp;
we had started our work here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.200
people used to ask Me questions after questions.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.880
I mean, all sensible questions, I mean,&nbsp;
all about the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.520
It’s all concerning the knowledge&nbsp;
of Sahaj Yoga, nothing outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.800
because what is outside Sahaja Yoga I don’t know.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:24.880
But still it was only&nbsp;
questioning about it, not being.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.280
So, how do we grow in Sahaj Yoga?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.440
When we have such a thinking capacity.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.200
First you jump into thoughtless awareness.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.960
Means a thought that rises&nbsp;
within you and falls off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.880
and another thought that rises within&nbsp;
you and falls off – the space in-between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.960
those two thoughts, that is the one we&nbsp;
achieve through our Kundalini awakening.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.600
We have to establish that space.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.360
Now what is that space?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:04.520
That’s the mouth of our entry into&nbsp;
the processes of the Divine power.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.120
Say for example, this is the mouth of this mike.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.800
If I say something here or here it won’t work out.
It will only work out when I say something here.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:21.320
In the same way, if you have a problem,&nbsp;
to begin with, a Sahaja Yogi will try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:28.360
solve it the way he has been solving it before&nbsp;
– like he’ll rationalize it, he’ll analyze it.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.880
He’ll sit with other Sahaja Yogis,&nbsp;
sit down and analyze Sahaja Yoga also.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.360
Is a very common pastime with&nbsp;
some of the Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.280
There’s nothing to analyze in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.800
It is the synthesis.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:52.080
So what we have to do is to feel it more within&nbsp;
us and establish that thoughtless awareness.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:18:03.760
Any problem you have – I’ll give you an example, a&nbsp;
very simple example of Regis having, coming to Me.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:12.480
He had his thesis to be put for&nbsp;
examination and he was fed up.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.760
He couldn’t, he didn’t even have patience&nbsp;
to put in a proper bound and all that.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.920
And he came to Me and he said, “Mother&nbsp;
what to do with this?” I said, “All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.600
you bring your thesis to Me.” I took&nbsp;
the thesis in My hand, that’s all.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.320
He said, “Aren’t You going to read it?” I said,&nbsp;
“No, there’s no need to read it.” I just closed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:39.120
My eyes, and gave it back to him, I said, “You&nbsp;
put it for examination”, and third day he was PhD.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.240
Now what did I do?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.920
No magic, nothing.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.800
It’s no magic.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.640
It’s so practical.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.880
God has His own powers.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.520
He has His own machinery.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.360
He has His own government, He has everything.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.720
Which is dynamic! You can’t imagine&nbsp;
how many dimensions He can work it out.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.760
Just you have to put it in&nbsp;
the mouth of that machinery.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.480
If you can do it you get the results easily.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:18.560
Only one thing God cannot do, that is&nbsp;
to make you sensible, to make you wise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.960
that’s one thing that’s your own&nbsp;
lookout, that’s in your own choice.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.080
Because you are guided by your ego.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.720
You are identified with your ego.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:38.240
And anything I say may upset&nbsp;
you, or may appeal to you.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:46.520
God knows how you are going to react.
But only way you can grow is to be in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.920
the center to see, not to&nbsp;
go to extremes of anything.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.360
To be in the center.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.640
Even listening to Me try to be in the center.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.680
But human beings are funny as I told&nbsp;
you, you see, they must go to extremes.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.040
You give them any job they&nbsp;
must go to the extremes.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.160
Anything you give them they cannot keep to&nbsp;
the centre, they can never keep the balance.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.360
Now see, this one, if it could not&nbsp;
be balanced, how can I speak on that?

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.640
I mean, in day-to-day life we never sit&nbsp;
without a balance on a chair, do we?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.760
Do we sit on one side all the time?

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.640
Or do we drive our cars on&nbsp;
one side – declined like that?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.360
Do we do anything that is under&nbsp;
imbalance – say for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.600
these lights, how they are well balanced.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.120
It has to be in balance everything, but in our&nbsp;
behavior towards God we are very much imbalanced.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.960
For example, if I tell you “Stand on your&nbsp;
heads, you will get to God”, you’ll do it.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.760
You’ll go on doing it.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.440
Till you’ll break your neck, land up in&nbsp;
the lunatic asylum you will go on doing it.&nbsp;

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:03.120
But you must understand that how can&nbsp;
you achieve God by doing these things.&nbsp;

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.640
These things anybody can do.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.120
All these things can be done by anyone whatsoever.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.880
But can you pulsate Kundalini&nbsp;
in the triangular bone?

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.800
You cannot, that’s not possible for anyone.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:29.280
You can jump, you can shout, you can&nbsp;
scream, you can fly (She laughs), maybe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:36.000
I don’t know, but you cannot make your&nbsp;
Kundalini pulsate in the triangular bone.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.040
Now it is for you to see.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:45.000
But if you are coming with this&nbsp;
doubting mind it just doesn’t work out.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.200
I’m not saying you should have faith in anyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.400
blind faith is just the same,&nbsp;
another extreme of blind faith.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.760
They end up in lunatic asylum as I told you.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.720
The other day one gentleman met Me in India.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.840
He said that “My wife was a great Krishna Bhakta&nbsp;
and now she’s ended up in a lunatic asylum”.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.920
I said “What Krishna, which one?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.960
Was she connected with God?

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.680
Did she know where Krishna resides within us?”.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.000
“No, she gave up the family.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.480
She said ‘I’ve become Meerabai’.”&nbsp;

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:27.080
This is how we behave towards ourselves&nbsp;
when it comes to Sahaj Yog also.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.080
Now somebody asked Me today how&nbsp;
many, how much we have to meditate.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.680
I mean you don’t have to meditate at all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.160
to be very frank.
I mean, I never meditate.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.760
I am in meditation all the time.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.040
I don’t know how to get out of it.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.560
(Laughter)
So you don’t meditate.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.600
You are in it!
But to be in it you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.640
to practice a little bit, because you have been&nbsp;
identified with so many other things of life.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.000
Like, you can be easily thinking.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.320
I mean it’s easy for you to think, and&nbsp;
very difficult for you not to think,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.680
because you have been doing like that.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.160
At the slightest pretext&nbsp;
you’ll jump into that thinking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.840
and once it starts the horse is galloping.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.160
It doesn’t stop.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.200
So you have to learn to be&nbsp;
silent, to stop that thinking.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.040
This is what you have to do.&nbsp;

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.400
But in Sahaja Yoga also we&nbsp;
start thinking about it.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.740
What can you think about Sahaj Yog?

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:41.600
Nothing! You leave it to thoughtless&nbsp;
awareness, in that state.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.720
So try to be in thoughtless&nbsp;
awareness as much as you can.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:54.000
But where do the Western Sahaja&nbsp;
Yogis fail – we must understand that.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.160
I’m sorry there are new people and I&nbsp;
shouldn’t expose many things about you.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.320
But doesn’t matter, they are our&nbsp;
children, they won’t feel bad about it.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.440
Where do we fail, we should face it.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:12.120
We feel this way, that so far&nbsp;
we have been great experts in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.680
spoiling everything, through our thinking.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.720
You give them a cake, they’ll&nbsp;
sit down and analyze it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.160
till that the cake will get all cold,&nbsp;
is finished, and you just can’t eat it.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.280
You give them a marriage – they’ll sit down&nbsp;
and analyze it, how to make yourself happy.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.920
I mean, you are happy there, why&nbsp;
do you have to think about it?

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.160
So make a mess of your marriage.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.720
You give them children – you’ll sit down&nbsp;
and read some books about your children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:48.840
by the time the children will be&nbsp;
sick and would be good for nothing.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.040
So because of our rationality we have learnt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.760
make a mess of everything that&nbsp;
is living, that is joy-giving.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:02.320
We have closed our heart&nbsp;
completely with our rationality.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.720
So, to grow we should be a&nbsp;
little irrational in Sahaj Yoga.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.080
For example, if you are very meticulous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:18.320
very particular as you call it, you&nbsp;
must try to give up that extreme nature.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.440
But if you are extremely careless&nbsp;
or you don’t care for anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.640
also that is extreme, that you have to give up.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.800
Both extremes are to be given up.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.800
You have to be in the center in your attitude.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:41.120
Then only you can grow because you know the sap&nbsp;
of life flows through your center, central channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:51.720
of Sushumna, the parasympathetic, and that’s&nbsp;
why you should avoid all kinds of extremes.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:57.560
Even in Sahaja Yoga, one has to be careful.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.080
It is a mission, but it is&nbsp;
not a mission of missionaries.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:08.480
It is the mission of love as such, those&nbsp;
who love, those who love human beings.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.800
Nothing is more important than love in Sahaj Yoga.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.120
You can’t be harsh with people whom you love.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.200
If you love, if you say something to&nbsp;
them, doesn’t matter, they won’t feel bad.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:30.440
But if you don’t love and then just go on&nbsp;
sermoning and shouting at them, that’s no good.&nbsp;

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:38.080
First establish your love&nbsp;
for yourself and for others.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.000
You have to establish your love.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.360
You should feel hankering for others.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:55.280
Now the competition has to change, the&nbsp;
style of competition among Sahaja Yogis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.240
the competition should be how much you love.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.360
Who loves more, let there be a competition.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.360
Who obliges you more.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.800
Who shares more.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.640
Who serves others more?

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:15.400
Let there be a competition – in loving,&nbsp;
not in hating, not in finding faults,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.760
in rationalizing I should say of everything.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.680
Love cannot be rationalized.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.000
I mean, people can’t understand&nbsp;
why I am so mad about you people.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:35.120
There’s so many people in India who are belonging&nbsp;
to the group to which my husband belongs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.200
that style – they can’t understand,&nbsp;
they said: “This woman has everything.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.560
Is She mad?

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.640
She is going to the villages and wasting Her&nbsp;
life, why doesn’t She enjoy Herself?” See,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:54.640
they can’t understand, I enjoy My love.
This is what you must know – to enjoy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:04.120
your virtues, and enjoy your love;&nbsp;
and you will be rewarded by it.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.720
It’s not hard, it’s the easiest thing.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.680
Supposing you love someone – supposing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:14.560
I mean it’s a big supposition for many – but&nbsp;
supposing you really, genuinely love someone.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:20.000
Think like that, I mean in&nbsp;
imagination you can think of someone.&nbsp;

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.320
Now that person is going to meet&nbsp;
you – say, you have to go to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.680
that person and there are lots&nbsp;
of odds, you cannot get a taxi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.080
you cannot get a train, you are worried:&nbsp;
“Now how to get to that person now.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.000
He would be waiting.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.920
And he would be worried or she would be waiting.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.520
Now what must be happening to them”.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.480
You are all the time thinking.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.960
And you are worried and then you don’t&nbsp;
know what to do, “Should we walk?”.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.560
Then you walk a little distance and you come&nbsp;
back, “No, might get a train, let’s try this”.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.800
You try all kinds of things, you&nbsp;
see, just to reach that person.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:07.080
And then it’s raining, and don’t have an umbrella.
You get completely drenched.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:16.400
Absolutely fagged out, tired but still – and the&nbsp;
moment you meet the person, you see the person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:23.440
all the worries and all the turmoils, all the&nbsp;
troubles and all the labor that you have put in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.040
vanishes into thin air and the&nbsp;
joy fills your life completely.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:38.160
How love is rewarding!

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.400
So one must learn to love and not to rationalize.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:53.040
There is big scope in Sahaja Yoga to rationalize&nbsp;
because you become even a freer person.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.920
You really become free.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.440
I mean, after Sahaj Yoga&nbsp;
if you want to go to hell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:05.720
you can go faster than anybody else can,&nbsp;
because you really become a free bird.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:12.520
And if you want to go to&nbsp;
heaven you can do the same.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:19.480
So, one has to know that we have to&nbsp;
learn to compete in loving each other.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.400
We have some very beautiful Sahaj Yogis here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:28.280
very beautiful, and they have said sometimes&nbsp;
such beautiful things about others that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.040
sometimes in My vacant mood think&nbsp;
of them and I feel very happy.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:39.471
It’s just like poetry, to say&nbsp;
something good about others.

00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:51.400
You see, sometimes I provoke and then somebody&nbsp;
says good words about others – I feel very happy.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:56.760
Without love we are not going&nbsp;
to solve any problem whatsoever.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.680
What’s the use of having, say,&nbsp;
even 10,000 people with vibrations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.760
flowing without any love among them?
I mean, I just can’t think of such a thing.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.000
Once you are Realized, you should feel love.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.640
But you must fathom it.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.760
Because of rational habits, because of this&nbsp;
misidentifications before, you cannot give it up.&nbsp;

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:25.400
You see you are afraid, people are&nbsp;
even afraid to express their love.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.920
Somebody brought some sweets one day.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.760
I said, “For whom?” He said, “For Sahaj Yogis.”&nbsp;
So I said, “Why are you giving Me?” He said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:42.080
“Mother, if You give it would be better,&nbsp;
otherwise they may little bit doubt me.”

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:52.160
Sometimes we want to love, we want to express,&nbsp;
but we are afraid that people will misunderstand.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.920
Imagine, where are we?

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.280
What sort of human beings we have become&nbsp;
that we are afraid to express our love!&nbsp;

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:12.733
Then the recipients also they do not&nbsp;
want to have any love, how can that be?

00:32:12.733 --> 00:32:14.640
Is impossible.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:20.080
Every human being wants to be loved.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.758
They will be afraid today, tomorrow,&nbsp;
day after they will be all right.

00:32:25.758 --> 00:32:28.080
[Shri Mataji is now talking about a child]
It’s a born realized child.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.920
See how, what a personality! It’s a born realized.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.520
So many children are born&nbsp;
realized, do you know that?

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.480
Now, how many of you really&nbsp;
know about Realization?

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:49.800
These great children are born to you and&nbsp;
you don’t know anything about Realization.&nbsp;

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:58.120
So, we have to be bold about&nbsp;
our love and little shameless.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.240
Let people feel bad, let them think&nbsp;
wrong about us, doesn’t matter.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.800
But express your love.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.240
But it should not be filthy love.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.800
It should not be mixed love.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:17.120
It should not be with some&nbsp;
sort of a possessiveness in it.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.520
It should not be love in which&nbsp;
you are expressing something else.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:27.760
It should be pure love as the name of your&nbsp;
Mother is, absolutely emitting from you.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:38.640
Not with any idea, with any game, with anything&nbsp;
whatsoever, because you should know that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:51.440
is something very beautiful hidden within everyone&nbsp;
of you, which your Mother can see – and She loves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.640
loves that part that is within you&nbsp;
which is about to be born again.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.480
And you are that beautiful.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:08.720
In the same way you should love all the Sahaja&nbsp;
Yogis and all the other people of this world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:18.120
because they are all beautiful&nbsp;
beings just covered with three gunas.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:27.720
Let them be that and then your&nbsp;
Spirit will recognize the joy.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.920
Will emit the joy.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:37.080
You will be a source of joy and&nbsp;
you will give joy to others.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:43.160
Give up all your wrong ideas and your set ideas&nbsp;
about things, absolutely they are all wrong.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.160
Like Hitler believing that all Jews killed Christ.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:57.760
It was he who killed Christ and he was&nbsp;
killing all the Jews because Christ was a Jew.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:04.320
He thought killing one Jew was not&nbsp;
sufficient so kill all the rest of them.&nbsp;

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.240
All those who hate have reasoning behind it.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.920
They have to give some reasoning because&nbsp;
they cannot hate without reasoning.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.240
Those who love do not need any reasoning.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.840
They have no time to reason it out.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.240
They just love.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:27.760
Because they can see something;&nbsp;
that love gives them that sight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.160
of the beauty of others which is hidden in them.
Sometimes some people can be very arrogant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.920
you have seen how people have been rude to Me:&nbsp;
makes no difference to Me, to be very frank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:50.840
because I know behind this rudeness lies that&nbsp;
thinking, so respect, respect each other.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:57.200
And know that you have that joy, and you&nbsp;
have that power to give that joy to others;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.080
and when you give that joy, that&nbsp;
joy returns back to you as joy.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.720
So what lacks in us that we&nbsp;
do not give joy to others.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:14.560
Unless and until you give joy to others&nbsp;
the joy doesn’t return back to you.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.040
That’s the lacking.&nbsp;

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.840
Now do not rationalize that either.
Immediately people start thinking about it.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.940
We have done a lot, I can tell you, we&nbsp;
are enjoying each other quite a lot.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.560
It’s really enjoyable.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.520
If it was not so, you would not have been&nbsp;
there together, because there is nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:42.280
binding otherwise between us, except for&nbsp;
love, except for that joy-giving love.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:47.160
There’s nothing else, because&nbsp;
we have no money transactions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.440
there’s no business on here at all, any kind.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:57.520
There is no intellectual rapport&nbsp;
going on between you and Me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:05.680
neither there is possibility of Me getting&nbsp;
elected to the parliament (laughter), nor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:16.080
I belong to any leadership of any,&nbsp;
you can say, these striking people.&nbsp;

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.040
Without all these things how&nbsp;
are we attached to each other?

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:26.520
Because there’s something supreme that&nbsp;
we can get out of our relationships.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:37.493
That’s pure joy.
May God bless you all!

00:37:37.493 --> 00:37:37.800
[Shri Mataji is addressing a new person]

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.440
…first time, is it?

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.160
Good.&nbsp;

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:47.080
Please put your, just your hands&nbsp;
like this, just straight like that.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:55.600
Both the feet should be touching the Mother&nbsp;
Earth, just like… with love; just touch you.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:02.840
Just put your hands like this, straight.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:10.000
You may close your eyes, yes,&nbsp;
close your eyes, just close.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.680
Please close your eyes, close&nbsp;
your eyes, close your eyes.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.680
Keep your feet steady.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.920
Steady, steady yourself.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.440
Just steady yourself, and relaxed, relax.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:37.720
Put your hands on your lap,&nbsp;
if you think it’s strenuous.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.200
Got it.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.000
Yes.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:53.720
Just enjoy yourself, you have got it.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.440
All you will start feeling cool&nbsp;
breeze in your hand, most of you.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:13.240
It’s a tremendous experience, try to remember it.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.640
If you can put your bag down, down will be better.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.400
And are you wearing a coat also?

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.280
Is she wearing a coat?

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.240
She has to be little comfortable.
Yes.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.440
And – are you wearing a coat?

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.200
Think if you take out your coat&nbsp;
would be better, yes, be comfortable.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.800
Yes.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.764
Yes.

00:39:46.764 --> 00:39:46.774
Yes, yes.

00:39:46.774 --> 00:39:49.538
What’s the matter?
Lady: I had an open heart operation.

00:39:49.538 --> 00:39:50.520
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Lady: I had an open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.280
heart operation and I still can’t walk, you know.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.760
These are shoes.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.390
Shri Mataji: Alright.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:00.300
They’ll bring your shoes, please.
Lady: I have… – I have in my bag.&nbsp;

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.960
Shri Mataji: Alright, let her wear the shoes.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.480
Lady: Yes?

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:10.320
Thank you.
Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:10.640
It’s now, you – I’ll see afterwards&nbsp;
little bit, I’ll just treat you, so later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.800
on you can get it, alright?

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:20.427
I will just treat you.
Lady:… my bag…&nbsp;

00:40:20.427 --> 00:40:21.840
Shri Mataji: Keep them down there, keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.572
the shoes down, just relax.
Lady: Thank you.

00:40:24.572 --> 00:40:25.160
I’m so sorry.
Shri Mataji: Can you remove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.640
this from here – don’t be sorry.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.620
Just enjoy.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.840
Please sit down comfortably.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.480
Be comfortably, it’s alright.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:38.320
It’s My job.&nbsp;

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:48.800
You got it! (She laughs) You have got it too!
All of them are going to get it.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.280
Great people.&nbsp;

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.560
You haven’t got it as yet, his&nbsp;
Hamsa is catching a little bit.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.640
Have you got?

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.800
Still here, you see, there’s a little… if you keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.800
your eyes open it will work&nbsp;
out, you see, catch here.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.920
Are you suffering from cold?

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.040
No, him.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:08.600
Yes.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.507
No?
Man: No.&nbsp;

00:41:09.507 --> 00:41:13.960
Shri Mataji: No.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.520
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?&nbsp;

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.200
Man: Yes.
Shri Mataji: It’s alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:27.240
just remove your hair from here, a little bit.
Yes, let Me see.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.623
It’s alright.
Better now?

00:41:31.623 --> 00:41:40.240
(Man: “Yes”) It’s better now?
Yes.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.640
Did you do any pranayama?

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.280
Pranayam, did you do?

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.087
Any yoga asanas and all that?

00:41:49.087 --> 00:41:57.240
Man: Not really, no.
Shri Mataji: That’s little bit.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:03.080
(Man says something)
I think they all have got it.&nbsp;

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.440
Just see them, if they have&nbsp;
got, these three people.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.200
Just see.
You got it?

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.320
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.600
Good! Very good.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.920
Yes, they have.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.200
Except for this gentleman, we’ll have to find out.
Are you feeling?

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:17.560
No.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.480
That’s it.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.840
I can see that.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.880
Put your hands on your… this, and&nbsp;
be just, just relax, just relax.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.720
Close your eyes.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.680
It will work out.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:36.720
And put both the feet comfortably&nbsp;
like this, it will work out.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:41.520
It’s better now, see?
Close your eyes, enjoy yourself.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:48.072
Just enjoy.

00:42:48.072 --> 00:42:54.600
(To the lady who had heart surgery)
Better?

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.600
If you had come to Me earlier, there was&nbsp;
no need to have an operation for a heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:04.320
is very easy to cure.
Lady: … I had a clinic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:10.680
and I tried everything, and couldn’t come.
Shri Mataji: But you have not tried God so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.680
far (She laughs).
Lady: Just I tried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.480
everything, really.
Couldn’t, couldn’t come.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.760
There was no other choice I&nbsp;
had (indistinct words follow)…&nbsp;

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:31.040
Shri Mataji: I know.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:48.512
You see, but we work out&nbsp;
through the parasympathetic.

00:43:48.512 --> 00:43:48.520
You see?

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:57.040
Then through parasympathetic&nbsp;
everything can work out.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.200
Heart can open, Swadishthan can&nbsp;
(Lady says something inaudible).&nbsp;

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.160
Now working out, is it?

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.680
Left side.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:11.003
For all of you I think, left is weak.

00:44:11.003 --> 00:44:11.040
(Sahaja yogi: “It’s still there.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.859
And Void”)
Void.

00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:19.200
(Sahaja yogi: “The right”) Void.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:27.040
(Inaudible word) But she is a doctor she says.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.616
Left Vishuddhi is strong, very strong.
(Bad audio quality) Cooling this side?

00:44:32.616 --> 00:44:34.489
(Lady: “Yes, it is”)
Good.

00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:39.000
(Somebody says: “Cooling”) Good.
Left Swadishtana.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.560
… Ask him to put his right hand on the Swadishtan.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.160
On the lower.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.420
Yes, little lower on this side, on the left.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.760
You see, little lower.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.040
Here, now.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:56.320
Please say the mantra of Nirmala Vidya.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:59.600
What about this gentleman, I&nbsp;
wanted to work it out on him.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.320
Why didn’t you feel the vibrations?

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:07.480
From… Come along, come, let’s see.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.520
What’s the matter?

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.720
Come and sit here.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.027
What’s the matter?
Man: I don’t know, Mother…&nbsp;

00:45:13.027 --> 00:45:14.787
Shri Mataji: You haven’t even felt it?
Man: No.&nbsp;

00:45:14.787 --> 00:45:16.840
Shri Mataji: You have forgiven&nbsp;
all the people, is it?

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.760
Sure?

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.920
Have you?
Man: OK.&nbsp;

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.400
Shri Mataji: You have to say that here.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.120
Now come along.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.616
Say: “Mother, I have forgiven all the people”.
Man: Mother, I have forgiven all the people.&nbsp;

00:45:25.616 --> 00:45:26.480
Shri Mataji: Again.
Man: Mother, I have forgiven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:44.345
all the people.
Shri Mataji: Again.&nbsp;

00:45:44.345 --> 00:45:47.298
Man: Mother, I have forgiven all the people.
Shri Mataji: Better.

00:45:47.298 --> 00:45:47.312
Is it raising?

00:45:47.312 --> 00:45:49.219
Feeling?
Heat.

00:45:49.219 --> 00:45:50.667
(Man: “Is here”) Heat is there, you see?

00:45:50.667 --> 00:45:59.960
… Your (?) left side means&nbsp;
it is … (indistinct: tepid?).

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:07.800
Ah.
Man: There’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.240
more tingling, Mother.
Shri Mataji: More tingling.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.440
In all the fingers?

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.760
Man: In the palm, it’s here.
Shri Mataji: Here.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.640
But not in the fingers as such, fingertips.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.750
Are you getting any fingertips tingling like this?&nbsp;

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:26.920
Man: Yes, little tingling.
Shri Mataji: Little bit.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:42.739
See, you are perspiring, also.

00:46:42.739 --> 00:46:45.720
Can you put this out?
Ah, left side.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:56.840
Just come and help Me.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.040
Come along, just help Me here.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:07.560
Let Me see what’s the problem, because he&nbsp;
hasn’t been able to get his realization.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.960
Raise the left, raise the left,&nbsp;
left is very weak, you see.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:21.646
They’re perspiring it.

00:47:21.646 --> 00:47:21.680
Om Shri Ganesha Aham Sakshat.
Ah.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:28.040
Now – What about your wife?

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.516
What did you tell Me?&nbsp;

00:47:29.516 --> 00:47:31.120
Man: That I’ve never married.
Shri Mataji: You never married?&nbsp;

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:42.851
Man: Never married.
Shri Mataji: Oh! Never!?

00:47:42.851 --> 00:47:56.840
You never married! Kundalini&nbsp;
is not very happy with that.&nbsp;

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.034
Aham Sakshat Gruha Lakshmi, Aham Sakshat Gruha&nbsp;
Lakshmi, Aham Sakshat Gruha Lakshmi, Aham Sakshat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:58.034 --> 00:48:18.135
Gruha Lakshmi, Aham Sakshat Gruha Lakshmi – ah!
Yogi: Vishuddhi.&nbsp;

00:48:18.135 --> 00:48:18.168
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Vishuddhi.

00:48:18.168 --> 00:48:21.640
On his left side…
Shri Mataji: Why don’t you marry now?&nbsp;

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.680
Will you?

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:29.320
If you say you will marry, only if you&nbsp;
say that, it will immediately work out.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.520
Alright?

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:40.560
Better now?

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.419
Sort of you don’t have an aversion.

00:48:43.419 --> 00:48:43.920
Man: Eh?
Shri Mataji: You don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.240
have sort of some anger for&nbsp;
women or something, do you?

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:56.720
No, no, no, no, no.
Ah… Still.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.640
Just imagine! Only for one reason God is so angry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:09.920
that you did not marry.
How can that be, isn’t it?

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.600
But your left, left Nabhi is catching,&nbsp;
that’s the place of the Gruha Lakshmi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.200
is the Goddess of the household, you see?

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.480
He is not very happy.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.560
Without the wife what is the house?

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:36.160
It becomes like a hospital.
Ah! Eh?

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:42.040
Yes, that goes there, alright, doesn’t matter.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.080
And even in Birmingham we are&nbsp;
getting arrays of bachelors.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.478
Get that Bala married (laughter, She laughs).

00:49:48.478 --> 00:49:51.720
I tell you, very bad effect!

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.080
That’s how you’ll learn some balancing&nbsp;
in life, you know, when you have wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.280
children, it’s very simple thing like that.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:09.480
See, this is also extreme behavior, isn’t it?

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:15.880
I mean, at this age you should be married.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.140
Is it better now?

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:26.136
Yogi: Yes, I feel cool, but&nbsp;
he has a left Vishuddhi.&nbsp;

00:50:26.136 --> 00:50:29.320
Shri Mataji: Left?
Yogi: Goes down to the heart now.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:48.040
That’s all.
Shri Mataji: Ha! No?

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:57.640
Raise it and tie it up.
It will work out.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:22.609
You get these hearing troubles some time?
Man: No, I had any trouble…&nbsp;

00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:24.440
Shri Mataji: Stops there… We can see that.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:24.462
Yes?
Man: Feeling hot.

00:51:24.462 --> 00:51:27.560
It gives a lot of heat.
Shri&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.200
Mataji: Should be alright.
But it’s awakened.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.040
That’s the main point is.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:43.080
It’s just here.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:51.760
You know, without a family life, we&nbsp;
are not enriched fully, isn’t it?&nbsp;

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.600
We have to have children, and family,&nbsp;
and all – then you see, the enrichment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:00.040
is complete, isn’t it, in life.
Otherwise you become very dry.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.480
That’s what has happened in your case.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.979
Now, is he better?

00:52:08.979 --> 00:52:16.680
[Yogi says “Yes… Right Sahasrara”] Right.
Done it! Close your eyes.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:26.520
Tie it up.
Should be alright.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.200
Just tie it up, tie up, tie up.
Three of you should put together.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.800
See, three of you should do it.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:56.440
Three people who are good at it.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.834
It started.
Are you feeling any cool breeze now in your hand?

00:53:06.834 --> 00:53:18.000
(Man: “There isn’t”) No?

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.680
Not yet.
Yogi: It’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:32.040
still there…
Shri Mataji: Comes up and goes down.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:56.440
(Yogi: “And goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:06.000
down, yes”) Tie it up.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:06.197
Agnya is weak.
(Yogi: “Hamsa”) Agnya and Hamsa.

00:54:06.197 --> 00:54:13.320
Now, toward (unclear) his&nbsp;
Vishuddhi it’s very tight.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.440
What are you doing, Bala?

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:21.440
Come along.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:26.360
Bala thinks you are a very happy man, you&nbsp;
see, that’s why he wants to be a bachelor now.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.800
(Shri Mataji laughs) What&nbsp;
have you been doing with him?

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:35.560
Come along, raise his Kundalini.
Philip, what’s the matter?

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:45.901
Why don’t you give him realization?

00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:45.997
(Yogi says something like that he thinks whether&nbsp;
it is better for him to work on anybody or not)&nbsp;

00:54:45.997 --> 00:54:49.884
So again you are afraid of giving love?&nbsp;

00:54:49.884 --> 00:54:51.280
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: No, there’s nothing to.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:55.680
Why will he have objection?

00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:01.400
Who can have any objection for Self-realization?
Nobody can, come along.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.600
He has been coming to Me so many days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:13.874
he should get it, why not?
Left side Vishuddhi.&nbsp;

00:55:13.874 --> 00:55:16.280
Yogi: His Vishuddhi’s…
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.640
Now don’t feel guilty about anything, alright?

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.520
Doesn’t matter if you have not married, you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.360
not to feel guilty about&nbsp;
it (She laughs, laughter).

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.320
Ha! Done, now, see.

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:33.280
Ah, alright?

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.787
Alright, feeling anything cool?
Man: I felt on the right hand.&nbsp;

00:55:36.787 --> 00:55:37.783
Shri Mataji: Good.

00:55:37.783 --> 00:55:41.040
(Man: “Yes”) Left is the weak side you&nbsp;
have, so you have felt it on the right.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.520
It’s good.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.000
Are you feeling alright?

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.520
Good! Better now?

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.240
Now raise up.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.440
Eh?

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.219
You went to some guru, is it?
Man: I didn’t see him.&nbsp;

00:56:16.219 --> 00:56:17.680
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Man: I didn’t actually see him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:25.018
but he is in India, and in various&nbsp;
subjects I liked his teachings.&nbsp;

00:56:25.018 --> 00:56:26.080
Shri Mataji: Who?
Man: Shantanand Saraswati.&nbsp;

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:31.520
Shri Mataji: Who is this new one?
Man: He’s in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:34.760
Shankaracharyas, I don’t know.
Shri Mataji: Ah! All of them are Shankaracharyas.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.280
The Shankaracharyas himself&nbsp;
are not realized souls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.000
you see, it’s something like (…unclear word…).

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:48.080
All the Shankaracharyas, except for one,&nbsp;
who is now retired, he had to retire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:56.720
because no realized soul can be a Shankaracharya.
See, once they get realization they are out of it.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:03.400
Nobody who is a realized soul can head&nbsp;
any religion, religious body, like that.&nbsp;

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:09.200
Ha! What does this fellow teach you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:17.819
this one, this Saraswati fellow?
Man: It’s a, yeah, way of life…&nbsp;

00:57:17.819 --> 00:57:20.427
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Man: I think it’s Advaita… (indistinct)&nbsp;

00:57:20.427 --> 00:57:26.160
Shri Mataji: But for that&nbsp;
why do you need a teacher?

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:56.240
Shaking, you see?
Good.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.120
They are good.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.880
They are from Brighton.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:05.600
Ah, I told you! I told you&nbsp;
about Brighton, remember?

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.280
They all said: “Horrid vibrations”.&nbsp;

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:12.217
I said: “No, in between there&nbsp;
are some very good ones”.

00:58:12.217 --> 00:58:15.240
(Laughter, She laughs) It’s&nbsp;
beautiful, they are all from Brighton.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:26.120
It’s great! (Laughter) Really! Just imagine!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:35.320
You all are so great (laughter, She laughs).
No, I did tell you.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.600
And you.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:43.160
I’m coming to Brighton for a day.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:50.320
That’s… I told you about this&nbsp;
(unclear word) on my way back.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:56.040
Hm?

00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.347
Alright?

00:59:01.347 --> 00:59:01.960
(She laughs).
Just here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.080
you know, there’s something here that you catch.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.640
Just remove his hair a little bit.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.040
Little bit here, here, here, just here.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.040
No, on top, yes.
That’s it.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.102
His Agnya catches, you see.

00:59:13.102 --> 00:59:14.640
(Yogi: “Yes”) Agnya and Vishuddhi.

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:23.492
It’s a combination.

00:59:23.492 --> 00:59:24.740
(Yogi: “That’s right”)
You watch Me here.

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.040
You watch this portion.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.480
Ha! Are you alright now?

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.444
Feeling anything cool?
Man: I’m feeling it cool.&nbsp;

00:59:33.444 --> 00:59:34.920
Shri Mataji: See, this is alright, started now.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.960
Alright?

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:42.280
But now you have to give some treatment to&nbsp;
the gentleman, otherwise he won’t leave you.

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.960
You saw how you were shaking?

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:47.343
Man: I have to…
Shri Mataji: You’ll know that.&nbsp;

00:59:47.343 --> 00:59:49.537
Man: I’ll have to know…
Shri Mataji: They will tell you.

00:59:49.537 --> 00:59:52.027
(Man: “Thank you”) Bala knows.

00:59:52.027 --> 00:59:53.080
Alright?
Man: Thank you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.800
Mataji.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.040
I’m happy it has started.
(Bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:25.960
quality audio) … too much left… so that’s left.
Now the… have you been to some gurus or someone?

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.960
No-one?

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.671
No-one at all.

01:00:30.671 --> 01:00:34.114
You see, just come here, I’ll tell you (?).

01:00:34.114 --> 01:00:36.560
Good.
Get up, just face Me.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.400
Can you sit facing Me?

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:44.440
And just pull your… yes, just, you see?

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.170
See, this one is.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:55.320
Perspiring, this hand.
It’s perspiring too, it’s interesting.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.821
You have been to no guru or anyone like that?

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:58.863
(Man: “No”) To no-one?

01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:03.343
(Man: “Yes”) Have you been reading&nbsp;
these third-eye people and all that?

01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:05.520
(Man replies no) Something about, what you call…
Yogi: He says he has a problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:12.910
with his mother.
Shri Mataji: Good.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.520
(A yogini tells Shri Mataji about some connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:24.000
of the seeker’s mother with&nbsp;
the Hare Krishna) Krishna?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.600
Hare Rama.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.137
Only his mother has been.

01:01:28.137 --> 01:01:39.320
(Yogini: “Yes…”) He has not been to anything.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.122
You feel alright otherwise, normally?

01:01:43.122 --> 01:01:43.148
(Man: “Yes”) Alright.

01:01:43.148 --> 01:01:45.880
(Other man: “Sometimes he can&nbsp;
get a pain (?) in the temple&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.200
here build up”)
Build like that.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.840
And then, what about your sleeping?

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.177
You feel nice, you get nice&nbsp;
sleep or you feel restless?

01:01:55.177 --> 01:02:00.720
(Man: “Just think”)
Just think so?

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.720
Now good.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.747
See, see how cold his feet are.
Yogi: Void.&nbsp;

01:02:02.747 --> 01:02:07.147
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Void.&nbsp;

01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:09.240
Shri Mataji: But he says&nbsp;
he’s not been to any guru.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.870
What sort of books you read, what are you doing?&nbsp;

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.894
Man: What am I doing?
Shri Mataji: Ha.

01:02:13.894 --> 01:02:22.520
(Man: “I’m just living in a place just waiting to&nbsp;
live in the country…”) What are you doing there?

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.800
In the flat, in the country?

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.540
What do you do?

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:37.800
(Unclear reply – he said he took&nbsp;
drugs but he has given up.) Alright.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:50.160
But little drugs you take sometimes.
That’s why Void, that’s why the Void.&nbsp;

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.600
No, no, it’s not the mother’s point, you see,&nbsp;
it’s the Void, his, his own problem is the Void.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.920
Do you get nervous here in the stomach sometimes?

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:06.160
Sometimes you do, isn’t it?

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:17.200
Is Void.
He is better?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:25.760
The hands are not perspiring so much, are they?

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:49.989
Know you can give up drugs,&nbsp;
no difficulty, you see?

01:03:49.989 --> 01:03:50.061
Just you decide you’ll give up, hm?
(Man: “Yes”) It’s better now?

01:03:50.061 --> 01:03:50.600
Good.
You see, with some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.040
I’ve seen, drugs don’t have so much&nbsp;
effect, but some are very sensitive.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.711
It won’t suit you.

01:03:56.711 --> 01:03:58.200
See, you are a saint.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.180
You can’t take drugs.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:21.160
You see – how white the whole thing has become.
Better now.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:21.535
Now, come up?

01:04:21.535 --> 01:04:23.520
(Yogi: “It’s started to cool”) Good.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.280
He’s a saint, you see.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:34.040
That’s why he, even little drugs&nbsp;
is, is, I can’t even… it depends on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.000
see, what fiber you are made of.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.920
Some people I’ve seen they’ll&nbsp;
take drums full of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.360
nothing happens, you see, they&nbsp;
don’t get into drugged condition.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:55.080
Some people get it so much, and&nbsp;
it affects some people very much.&nbsp;

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.143
Better now.
Better now?

01:05:00.143 --> 01:05:04.904
(Man: “Yes”) Are you feeling cool breeze?

01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:09.532
(Man: “No”) No, that’s it.

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:10.660
Your Agnya is there, still.
You are from Birmingham?

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:15.000
Man: No.
Shri Mataji: From where?&nbsp;

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Man: From London.
Shri Mataji: From London?&nbsp;

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:25.640
Man: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Alright.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.480
They are perspiring.
Just put your hand there.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.600
Very slow heart.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:46.440
(Inaudible conversation with a&nbsp;
yogi) You must take to garlic.&nbsp;

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:55.640
Now, in his case you have to raise the right.
Just the opposite of it.&nbsp;

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:15.280
Better now?

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.560
Now, is it better?
Man: Still heavy.&nbsp;

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.467
Shri Mataji: Eh?&nbsp;

01:06:20.467 --> 01:06:21.240
Man: Still feels heavy in the right.
Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s it.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.440
To raise it.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.560
You’ll be alright.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:42.280
Just look at your father, he’s enjoying himself.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:07:13.291
He wrote a very nice letter to Me.
What do you say?&nbsp;

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:13.319
Yogi: Agnya.
Shri Mataji: Eh?&nbsp;

01:07:13.319 --> 01:07:15.440
Yogi: Agnya is there (?).
Shri Mataji: Is better now, see?

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.340
Is improving.
But right side very weak.

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:25.520
You work out.&nbsp;

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:42.600
Sort of receding, you recede, you know?
You recede away from things, isn’t it?&nbsp;

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:48.400
I mean, you don’t like the world, sort&nbsp;
of thing, you want to recede away?

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.160
That’s what happens to you, is it?

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.440
Because people are nasty.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.360
(Man says something) Eh?

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:13.200
But you just don’t… you… what do you feel&nbsp;
about life as such, what do you think?

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:23.611
Like frustrated?
Man: Yes.

01:08:23.611 --> 01:08:25.200
I spend money…
Shri Mataji: That.&nbsp;

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.680
Man: Yes.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.682
And worry about money…
Shri Mataji: Eh?&nbsp;

01:08:28.682 --> 01:08:29.440
Man: Worry about money…
Shri Mataji: It’s alright.&nbsp;

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:41.600
Man: …feel a bit dejected (unclear).
Shri Mataji: You’re not to be dejected, alright?

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.800
You need to come up.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.320
A little.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.461
Ha! See now.

01:08:50.461 --> 01:08:52.040
(Yogi: “Agnya”)
Better now?

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.520
Feeling better?
Man: More&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.360
fresh, alright.
Shri Mataji: More fresh.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:04.147
That’s it.
Man: This is tinglish… (?)&nbsp;

01:09:04.147 --> 01:09:05.480
Shri Mataji: You see, that’s it, you see?

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.956
It’s a thing moves from one to that.

01:09:06.956 --> 01:09:06.960
Yes?

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.080
(A small child speaks to Shri Mataji: … flower…)
That’s good.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.960
You think if I give him the&nbsp;
flower he’ll feel better?

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.280
Alright.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:21.827
You see, her son is saying ‘alright,&nbsp;
just you have the flower, let’s see’.

01:09:21.827 --> 01:09:28.187
(She laughs) Now, is it better?
Man: Right starts to get heavy.

01:09:28.187 --> 01:09:30.627
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Man: Right starts to get heavy.

01:09:30.627 --> 01:09:31.400
Shri Mataji: Heavy.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.027
Right.
Man: Yes.&nbsp;

01:09:32.027 --> 01:09:39.840
Shri Mataji: Ah.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:52.807
It’s heavy.

01:09:52.807 --> 01:09:55.805
(After some silence during which&nbsp;
there is probably some workout) So.

01:09:55.805 --> 01:09:56.542
Man: It’s slightly…
Yogi: It’s still…&nbsp;

01:09:56.542 --> 01:09:59.040
Shri Mataji: Now you are better now.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.120
Are you?

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.800
How are you feeling?

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.340
Are you feeling any cool breeze?&nbsp;

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.200
Man: Slightly.
Shri Mataji: Slight.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.960
What is there to be worried about money?

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.800
[Man: “To be worried?

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.440
I guess from that I invested&nbsp;
some money and I’m worried that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:33.635
… (indistinct words)… to do&nbsp;
these things”] To… to do?

01:10:33.635 --> 01:10:35.320
Man: To do all these things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.480
I intend to do … (inaudible sentence)
Shri Mataji: Where have you invested?

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:40.980
Eh?

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.697
But you have invested money into what projects?

01:11:15.697 --> 01:11:15.928
(Inaudible sentence of the man.

01:11:15.928 --> 01:11:31.503
Then says some words sounding like “Selling&nbsp;
marijuana” Somebody explains: “Selling drugs.”)&nbsp;

01:11:31.503 --> 01:11:41.640
Shri Mataji: Oh! That’s&nbsp;
dangerous! They are cheats!&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.720
They are cheats! (Man: “They won’t sell&nbsp;
drugs”) No, they can cheat you, they are.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:53.400
It’s obviously, this is such a bad traffic!

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.195
Money is not everything.

01:11:57.195 --> 01:11:58.160
Yes, that’s it.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.480
And that’s why they can cheat you.
Alright?

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480
Now, I’ll give them a bandhan.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.840
But if you get your money back, then&nbsp;
you are not going to go into it anymore.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.800
Alright?

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:26.160
That’s the promise.
Alright.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.360
You are literally, absolutely fagged out.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.920
You know?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.680
You may not.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.794
You have to look after yourself.
See, the Void is all moving.&nbsp;

01:12:40.794 --> 01:12:48.075
Yogi: Especially on the right side in here.
Shri Mataji: In here.

01:12:48.075 --> 01:12:54.760
Void is, the lower side.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.260
Now.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:02.880
I would suggest for him, tell him the Void mantra.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.000
Put him on the photograph.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.080
Let him work it out, it will clear.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.880
That will solve your financial problem also.
You see, it goes simultaneously.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.120
Alright?
It’s a problem of your Nabhi.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:20.020
He’ll give you the mantra and you work it out.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:24.745
For a week, then come and see Me.

01:13:24.745 --> 01:13:34.226
(To the yogis) And also of Nabhi.
(Yogi: “Yes”) Alright.

01:13:34.226 --> 01:13:34.231
Good.

01:13:34.231 --> 01:13:34.960
(A small child’s voice is heard)
Should be alright.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:35.640
Eh?
Small child: Should&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.920
I work on somebody?
Shri Mataji: On whom do you want to work?

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.840
Work on hand, let’s see.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.440
Eh?

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.560
Work on Me.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.360
I see! (Shri Mataji laughs)&nbsp;
That’s the easiest to do, eh?

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.720
Very nice… See!
I’ll work on you, that’s the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:01.400
best! (Shri Mataji kisses the child and laughs)
So, who wants to work on, the new baby: see?

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:14.113
Wonderful! Nobody else, they don’t want&nbsp;
to work on anybody else: he’s very clever!

01:14:14.113 --> 01:14:14.440
Ah ah ah! Ah ah ah! Ah ah&nbsp;
ah! What is there to work?

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.520
Just to take love!
