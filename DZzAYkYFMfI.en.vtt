00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.981
Now I will tell you about only one chakra
first of all,

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:19.199
is the yellow chakra you see there called
as Swadishthan which moves around that void.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:34.670
This is the one which is responsible for producing
or manifesting our reflexes but that’s only

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.950
on the physical side.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.950
Now how much work this poor centre has to
do!

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:45.010
We have never thought that when we think the
energy we use in our thinking how is it replaced,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.480
thinking energy from where does it come in
our brain.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.559
We are using our brain all the time but what
is replacing it, is this center.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:01.489
So this center – you know the brain is made
of fats – this center converts the fat of

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.230
the stomach for the use of the brain and that’s
how – this is again hypothesis I am telling

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.009
you –
that’s how those who think too much go into

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:15.420
imbalance, futuristic thinking people planning
everything, plan this, plan that.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.409
Most of the plans fail also but they are planning
all the time, thinking too much.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:33.410
All that leads to one crisis is that person
becomes imbalanced in the sense that this

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:42.660
poor centre which has to do other jobs also,
it has to look after your liver, it has to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.790
look after your pancreas, it has to look after
your spleen, your kidneys and part of the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.240
intestine, large intestine.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.520
So a person who thinks too much, a very right
sided futuristic person first problem can

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520
come from his liver.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.030
In the medical science I don’t think we
have much knowledge about liver.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.130
Liver is by which we live.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.849
I think, it’s a very important organ in
the body.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.010
So the function of the liver is to absorb
all the poison of the body and convert it

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.610
into heat and which passes to the blood stream,
is the function in simple words.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.890
I am not using any medical terminology, simple
words.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.569
So now when you start thinking too much you
neglect your liver.

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.690
When you neglect your liver poor thing doesn’t
know how to do his job.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.860
So, the who heat is saturated in the stomach.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.660
The person has heat here then the heat starts
passing upward.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.110
When it passes towards the heart – we call
it right heart,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:06.769
in the medical science there is no right heart
but we have the center and right heart –

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:16.310
it creates problem and that problem is called
as asthma, simple words.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.790
This heat then also passes to your throat.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:29.370
Also it creates a kind of a cold which always
flows, you sneeze twenty times in the morning

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.370
all that sort.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.000
There are two types of colds also, we have
two types: we have one lethargic liver and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
one over active.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.260
So this is I talked about overactive.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.910
Now such a person is overactive.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.780
So he develops this cold, sneezing, this temper,
anger, anxiety, tension.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.700
(Apart: not jot, it’s better hold on, alright.)

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.530
Then this heat passes over.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.310
It can go to heart at a very young age.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:03.030
Supposing there are boys who are playing tennis
or something of a rigorous game, and playing

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.810
it this might affect that then have a massive
heart attack at a very young age which can

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.780
be fatal.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.190
Now the same heat when it passes through the
throat, we develop throat problem and we get

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.060
a sore throat and all kind of problems we
get.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.950
So, it’s not alright.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:36.110
Now, when it moves down say to your pancreas,
poor pancreas is also suffering because it

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.320
has no energy from this centre.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.150
So, a simple disease a person like that develops,
is diabetes.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.560
Too much of thinking gives diabetes nobody
would think.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.910
They think that too much sugar gives diabetes,
not thinking.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.889
In our Maharashtra few have to have a tea
properly, the sugar should be such that the

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.289
spoon must stand at right angles otherwise
it is not tea.

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:10.310
And nobody gets diabetes because the villagers
work in the morning, nicely sleeping down

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.260
in the night,
not worrying about tomorrow how to do this,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.460
how to do that, nothing.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.770
Only the people who are sitting on their seats
and planning, thinking, also worried, get

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.770
diabetes.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.770
Now diabetes is curable.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.840
They say it is inheritance.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:32.270
Also, it is curable by putting this centre
right.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.819
Then the third thing I told you is even more
dangerous, is the spleen.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:52.451
Now there is the life, is so funny that it
cannot be congenial to the working of the

00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:53.451
spleen.

00:05:53.451 --> 00:05:58.699
Spleen works and as you know everybody has
a smoggy morality, that is simple as you know,

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:05.620
so it happens that, suppose in the morning
you get up,

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.190
read the horrible newspaper, “Bombay blast
this, that”,

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.310
you mean that spleen starts wobbling.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.879
Then you don’t eat your food properly or
breakfast properly, just hurry up some or

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:24.420
the other, eat something, get into the car
cursing all the people on the way because

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.300
of the jam, reach the office where there the
boss is on you and absolutely, you’re in

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.880
a mess there out, and poor this spleen is
wobbling.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.660
She doesn’t understand the craziness of
this man,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.000
“How am I to produce the RBC [Red Blood
Cells]?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.320
Wherever I act?”

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.229
This craziness makes it vulnerable to blood
cancer.

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.220
So this thing is!

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.090
Because she is so crazy she doesn’t understand
how to react.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.509
Now what happens that this is supposing I
am saying to you is the spinal cord, that

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.030
is, and these are centres, this is the left
side, this is right side.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.380
Now they go on working extracting energy from
the centre, it gets exhausted.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.310
Suddenly something will happen, some sort
of a shock on the left side because you are

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.440
working on the right side, so it bends.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.680
When it bends the connection with the whole
is lost and that’s how you become numb.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.530
The main cannot reach anyone so they have
to take over.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:36.240
Now the left side is also a very mysterious
thing which will shock you.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.000
I don’t know if I would be able to speak
today about it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.860
That’s quite a mysterious thing in this
left side about which there is no knowledge

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.659
in the medical science.

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:50.550
Now so this trouble of leukemia comes in.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.780
Then it goes to kidneys, you see.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:08:01.770
It coagulates your kidneys, you cannot pass
urine, even urinary bladder would be like

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.770
this.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.169
Now you get this kidney trouble, you put on
dialysis.

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:10.069
Poor man dies of bankrupt, dies no doubt.

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:12.080
Nobody gets out.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.030
It’s a fact dialysis has not cured anyone
so far, I know.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:24.789
It just makes them live longer and longer
and it’s a fact.

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:26.860
So he dies.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:39.339
Then also it goes down as I told you in the
lower portion.

00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:40.339
And sometimes you do not feel hungry because
of the liver, plus you feel constipation.

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:45.330
And constipation can be of the worst type
that people get, that all their nights they

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.120
end up with minima or some sort of a distress.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:55.640
So these are the common diseases which will
be facing all such people who are overactive.
