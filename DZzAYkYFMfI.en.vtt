00:07.950 --> 00:12.981
Now I will tell you about only one chakra
first of all,

00:12.981 --> 00:19.199
is the yellow chakra you see there called
as Swadishthan which moves around that void.

00:19.199 --> 00:34.670
This is the one which is responsible for producing
or manifesting our reflexes but that’s only

00:34.670 --> 00:35.950
on the physical side.

00:35.950 --> 00:36.950
Now how much work this poor centre has to
do!

00:36.950 --> 00:45.010
We have never thought that when we think the
energy we use in our thinking how is it replaced,

00:45.010 --> 00:47.480
thinking energy from where does it come in
our brain.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.559
We are using our brain all the time but what
is replacing it, is this center.

00:53.559 --> 01:01.489
So this center – you know the brain is made
of fats – this center converts the fat of

01:01.489 --> 01:03.230
the stomach for the use of the brain and that’s
how – this is again hypothesis I am telling

01:03.230 --> 01:09.009
you –
that’s how those who think too much go into

01:09.009 --> 01:15.420
imbalance, futuristic thinking people planning
everything, plan this, plan that.

01:15.420 --> 01:23.409
Most of the plans fail also but they are planning
all the time, thinking too much.

01:23.409 --> 01:33.410
All that leads to one crisis is that person
becomes imbalanced in the sense that this

01:33.410 --> 01:42.660
poor centre which has to do other jobs also,
it has to look after your liver, it has to

01:42.660 --> 01:50.790
look after your pancreas, it has to look after
your spleen, your kidneys and part of the

01:50.790 --> 01:54.240
intestine, large intestine.

01:54.240 --> 02:05.520
So a person who thinks too much, a very right
sided futuristic person first problem can

02:05.520 --> 02:06.520
come from his liver.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.030
In the medical science I don’t think we
have much knowledge about liver.

02:09.030 --> 02:11.130
Liver is by which we live.

02:11.130 --> 02:14.849
I think, it’s a very important organ in
the body.

02:14.849 --> 02:21.010
So the function of the liver is to absorb
all the poison of the body and convert it

02:21.010 --> 02:30.610
into heat and which passes to the blood stream,
is the function in simple words.

02:30.610 --> 02:34.890
I am not using any medical terminology, simple
words.

02:34.890 --> 02:39.569
So now when you start thinking too much you
neglect your liver.

02:39.569 --> 02:45.690
When you neglect your liver poor thing doesn’t
know how to do his job.

02:45.690 --> 02:51.860
So, the who heat is saturated in the stomach.

02:51.860 --> 02:53.660
The person has heat here then the heat starts
passing upward.

02:53.660 --> 02:57.110
When it passes towards the heart – we call
it right heart,

02:57.110 --> 03:06.769
in the medical science there is no right heart
but we have the center and right heart –

03:06.769 --> 03:16.310
it creates problem and that problem is called
as asthma, simple words.

03:16.310 --> 03:17.790
This heat then also passes to your throat.

03:17.790 --> 03:29.370
Also it creates a kind of a cold which always
flows, you sneeze twenty times in the morning

03:29.370 --> 03:30.370
all that sort.

03:30.370 --> 03:33.000
There are two types of colds also, we have
two types: we have one lethargic liver and

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
one over active.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.260
So this is I talked about overactive.

03:35.260 --> 03:37.910
Now such a person is overactive.

03:37.910 --> 03:41.780
So he develops this cold, sneezing, this temper,
anger, anxiety, tension.

03:41.780 --> 03:44.700
(Apart: not jot, it’s better hold on, alright.)

03:44.700 --> 03:46.530
Then this heat passes over.

03:46.530 --> 03:52.310
It can go to heart at a very young age.

03:52.310 --> 04:03.030
Supposing there are boys who are playing tennis
or something of a rigorous game, and playing

04:03.030 --> 04:10.810
it this might affect that then have a massive
heart attack at a very young age which can

04:10.810 --> 04:12.780
be fatal.

04:12.780 --> 04:18.190
Now the same heat when it passes through the
throat, we develop throat problem and we get

04:18.190 --> 04:23.060
a sore throat and all kind of problems we
get.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.950
So, it’s not alright.

04:25.950 --> 04:36.110
Now, when it moves down say to your pancreas,
poor pancreas is also suffering because it

04:36.110 --> 04:38.320
has no energy from this centre.

04:38.320 --> 04:44.150
So, a simple disease a person like that develops,
is diabetes.

04:44.150 --> 04:48.560
Too much of thinking gives diabetes nobody
would think.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.910
They think that too much sugar gives diabetes,
not thinking.

04:52.910 --> 04:58.889
In our Maharashtra few have to have a tea
properly, the sugar should be such that the

04:58.889 --> 05:04.289
spoon must stand at right angles otherwise
it is not tea.

05:04.289 --> 05:10.310
And nobody gets diabetes because the villagers
work in the morning, nicely sleeping down

05:10.310 --> 05:13.260
in the night,
not worrying about tomorrow how to do this,

05:13.260 --> 05:15.460
how to do that, nothing.

05:15.460 --> 05:17.770
Only the people who are sitting on their seats
and planning, thinking, also worried, get

05:17.770 --> 05:18.770
diabetes.

05:18.770 --> 05:19.770
Now diabetes is curable.

05:19.770 --> 05:23.840
They say it is inheritance.

05:23.840 --> 05:32.270
Also, it is curable by putting this centre
right.

05:32.270 --> 05:36.819
Then the third thing I told you is even more
dangerous, is the spleen.

05:36.819 --> 05:52.451
Now there is the life, is so funny that it
cannot be congenial to the working of the

05:52.451 --> 05:53.451
spleen.

05:53.451 --> 05:58.699
Spleen works and as you know everybody has
a smoggy morality, that is simple as you know,

05:58.699 --> 06:05.620
so it happens that, suppose in the morning
you get up,

06:05.620 --> 06:08.190
read the horrible newspaper, “Bombay blast
this, that”,

06:08.190 --> 06:12.310
you mean that spleen starts wobbling.

06:12.310 --> 06:17.879
Then you don’t eat your food properly or
breakfast properly, just hurry up some or

06:17.879 --> 06:24.420
the other, eat something, get into the car
cursing all the people on the way because

06:24.420 --> 06:30.300
of the jam, reach the office where there the
boss is on you and absolutely, you’re in

06:30.300 --> 06:36.880
a mess there out, and poor this spleen is
wobbling.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.660
She doesn’t understand the craziness of
this man,

06:39.660 --> 06:42.000
“How am I to produce the RBC [Red Blood
Cells]?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.320
Wherever I act?”

06:43.320 --> 06:47.229
This craziness makes it vulnerable to blood
cancer.

06:47.229 --> 06:49.220
So this thing is!

06:49.220 --> 06:53.090
Because she is so crazy she doesn’t understand
how to react.

06:53.090 --> 06:58.509
Now what happens that this is supposing I
am saying to you is the spinal cord, that

06:58.509 --> 07:03.030
is, and these are centres, this is the left
side, this is right side.

07:03.030 --> 07:09.380
Now they go on working extracting energy from
the centre, it gets exhausted.

07:09.380 --> 07:14.310
Suddenly something will happen, some sort
of a shock on the left side because you are

07:14.310 --> 07:19.440
working on the right side, so it bends.

07:19.440 --> 07:26.680
When it bends the connection with the whole
is lost and that’s how you become numb.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.530
The main cannot reach anyone so they have
to take over.

07:30.530 --> 07:36.240
Now the left side is also a very mysterious
thing which will shock you.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.000
I don’t know if I would be able to speak
today about it.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.860
That’s quite a mysterious thing in this
left side about which there is no knowledge

07:42.860 --> 07:45.659
in the medical science.

07:45.659 --> 07:50.550
Now so this trouble of leukemia comes in.

07:50.550 --> 07:53.780
Then it goes to kidneys, you see.

07:53.780 --> 08:01.770
It coagulates your kidneys, you cannot pass
urine, even urinary bladder would be like

08:01.770 --> 08:02.770
this.

08:02.770 --> 08:06.169
Now you get this kidney trouble, you put on
dialysis.

08:06.169 --> 08:10.069
Poor man dies of bankrupt, dies no doubt.

08:10.069 --> 08:12.080
Nobody gets out.

08:12.080 --> 08:17.030
It’s a fact dialysis has not cured anyone
so far, I know.

08:17.030 --> 08:24.789
It just makes them live longer and longer
and it’s a fact.

08:24.789 --> 08:26.860
So he dies.

08:26.860 --> 08:39.339
Then also it goes down as I told you in the
lower portion.

08:39.339 --> 08:40.339
And sometimes you do not feel hungry because
of the liver, plus you feel constipation.

08:40.339 --> 08:45.330
And constipation can be of the worst type
that people get, that all their nights they

08:45.330 --> 08:49.120
end up with minima or some sort of a distress.

08:49.120 --> 08:55.640
So these are the common diseases which will
be facing all such people who are overactive.
