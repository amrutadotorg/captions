Shri Mataji:  

00:27.680 --> 00:31.760
The truth is that we are not this body,  

00:33.360 --> 00:44.240
this intellect, emotions, this ego, the 
conditionings, but we are the spirit.

00:44.240 --> 00:51.360
And the second truth is that there is 
a subtle all pervading divine power,  

00:52.560 --> 00:57.840
which is doing all the living work.

00:59.800 --> 01:05.120
Announcer: In 1970 Shri Mataji 
Nirmala Devi founded Sahaja Yoga,  

01:05.120 --> 01:09.680
a dynamic technique for meditation 
that takes us beyond our limitations.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.600
Through the awakening of the spiritual 
energy within us, we can experience the  

01:13.600 --> 01:18.960
integration of all aspects of our life, 
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.440
Thousands of people from more than 40 
countries have experienced this enlightenment.

01:24.320 --> 01:29.200
True peace in the world will only be achieved 
through the inner transformation of human beings.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.480
Sahaja yoga, the unique discovery.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.240
Truth is something, which can not be changed.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.680
It can not be challenged.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.840
It can not be imagined.

01:52.480 --> 01:58.080
One has to feel the truth on 
your central nervous system.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.680
What is the truth?

02:00.320 --> 02:08.320
The truth is that you are not this body, you are 
not this mind, you are not this intelligence,  

02:08.320 --> 02:13.440
you are not this conditionings or 
your ego, but you are pure spirit.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.800
This is one truth.

02:14.800 --> 02:22.800
The second one is that, this whole universe 
is covered with a very subtle energy,  

02:23.840 --> 02:31.840
which is called as the all 
pervading power of God’s love.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.640
Or in sanskrit language it 
is called as param chaitanya.

02:38.640 --> 02:45.040
These are the two things which we have 
to seek, and this is what once we know  

02:45.040 --> 02:52.880
what it is, then the truth you can 
feel it on your central nervous system.

02:54.560 --> 03:00.720
For this happening, there is an 
element already made within our being,  

03:02.560 --> 03:08.240
is a power which is a residual power of kundalini.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.720
It is called as kundalini because it 
is coiled in three and half coils.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.560
It is resting in the triangular 
bone called as sacrum.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.280
That shows that the Greeks 
knew that it was a sacred bone.

03:23.840 --> 03:28.960
Now this is the energy that has to 
be awakened, and when it is awakened,  

03:29.920 --> 03:37.360
it rises through 6 very subtle energy centres 
and pierces through the fontanel bone area.

03:38.240 --> 03:47.040
And then you feel as if a cool breeze is 
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

03:48.160 --> 03:53.040
This is just like a connection with the 
mains as we have with every instrument.

03:54.320 --> 03:59.840
With this happening you 
become a self realized person  

04:00.400 --> 04:06.480
in the sense that you develop a new dimension in 
your awareness in your central nervous system.

04:07.040 --> 04:18.320
On which you can feel the centres or these 
chakras of your own being and that of others.

04:18.320 --> 04:24.160
So you get the self knowledge, also you get the 
knowledge about others, what are their problems.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.520
Thus you become collectively 
conscious as Jung has said  

04:29.520 --> 04:33.920
that next stage of human awareness is 
going to be collectively conscious.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.840
So you become collectively conscious,  

04:35.840 --> 04:40.240
it is a question of becoming it is not 
just a certificate, it is not exercise.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.940
Sahaja, saha means with, and ja is born with you.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.600
Also sahaj means  

04:47.600 --> 04:48.560
spontaneous.

04:50.160 --> 04:55.840
Yoga means the union with this 
all pervading divine power.

04:57.760 --> 05:03.680
Sahaja yoga is the right of every 
human being to achieve that ascent.

05:03.680 --> 05:10.240
In the evolutionary process, we have come 
to the stage where we are human beings.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.560
The knowledge that we have is not absolute,  

05:14.400 --> 05:22.960
to get to the absolute knowledge, we have to 
rise higher into new realms beyond thought.

05:23.520 --> 05:29.040
And this a new realm which you achieve 
after Sahaja yoga, by which you feel  

05:29.040 --> 05:33.600
the truth, the absolute truth, 
and everybody feels the same.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.560
With the awakening of the kundalini,  

05:40.240 --> 05:45.600
so many things also happen, because 
it nourishes all your centres.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.800
By the nourishment of the centres, you 
find that your health suddenly improves.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.640
Definitely Sahaja yoga has cured  

05:54.640 --> 05:58.960
many psychosomatic diseases 
like cancer, no doubt about it.

05:58.960 --> 06:05.040
But it only happens if the kundalini rises 
and pierces through your fontanel bone area.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.760
Then it only happens and it works 
out in a way that will definitely  

06:12.000 --> 06:14.640
show you that something new has happened.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.680
But apart from that you get your mental peace.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.240
Many mental cases have been cured.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.760
Also you get your intelligence 
suddenly sharpened up,  

06:25.760 --> 06:32.560
because the brain that you are using is just a 
bit part but with the light of the spirit comes  

06:32.560 --> 06:38.640
into your brain you start seeing things much 
more deeply and understanding them much better.

06:38.640 --> 06:43.760
It is such a remarkable thing, that it 
has to happen to all of us as the last  

06:43.760 --> 06:47.200
jump or break through into 
the evolutionary process.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.800
As this Sahaja yoga is not a new thing,  

06:50.800 --> 06:56.720
it has been there but only transmitted 
from one master to one disciple.

06:56.720 --> 07:02.160
Only in the third century, somebody wrote 
about it very clearly for the masses  

07:02.160 --> 07:09.360
and now it is becoming practical and thousands of 
people are getting realization all over the world.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.440
May God bless you.
