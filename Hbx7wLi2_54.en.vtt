00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:11.998
Now the mass evolution has started and there
are many who have got Realisation like that.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:18.332
I’m happy to know in England also we have
at least two to three thousand people

00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:25.569
who are realised very well, who are established,
but there may be much more who have got Realisation,

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.892
but then you have to establish yourself like
a tree.

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:32.629
Once you establish like a tree you can give Realisation to
others

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:37.488
and you can give them peace and the
whole thing is such a transformed personality.

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:43.300
Because the second thing that happens to you when
you become the Spirit that you become so powerful,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.339
so powerful that nothing dominates
you. Nothing dominates you.

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:52.877
There is no habit that can dominate you. No
temptation can dominate you.

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:57.848
And you become very powerful, but at the
same time you are extremely compassionate,

00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:03.677
you are extremely kind, so it is a very
compassionate power that you develop of the Spirit

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:07.661
and you become a new personality, a wonderful personality.

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:13.848
We know when we have Christmas...
when we have Easter, we give eggs to people.

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:18.048
This denotes the Resurrection
of Christ as our own Resurrection,

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:21.684
that an egg has to become the bird.

00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:28.901
It is symbolic of that, that we are like eggs when
we are closed, when we have this ‘I ness within us,

00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:34.193
and then suddenly when this
happens to us, this egg becomes the bird

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:38.848
and you become completely free and you know what freedom is.

00:01:38.928 --> 00:01:48.009
Freedom is no licence but freedom which ,
is absolutely not curbing anybody’s freedom

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:52.088
nor is giving you any bondages.

00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:55.696
It is something so great it should happen to all of us.

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:58.710
We have had many great saints in this country,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.715
I would like to mention William Blake who
was a great saint and who saw all this happening

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:08.272
Long time back, two hundred years back.

00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:16.428
And he wrote about it that such and such time
will come when men of God will become prophets

00:02:16.508 --> 00:02:20.182
and these prophets will have powers to make
others prophets.

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:29.028
He has said so many things that time has come
today for England to rise as He has desired and described.

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:35.515
That time is here today now at this
time you should get your Realisation.

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:41.289
You’ll realise that now you have
entered into that Kingdom of God.

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.992
We have also many people, we can
say even Mohammed Sahib has said that

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:48.318
“At the time of Resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:53.945
Exactly this happens, that when you get
your Realisation, when the Kundalini comes up,

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.986
and She touches the seat of God here,

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:07.583
immediately in your heart the reflection of God
starts emitting cool vibrations from your hands also.

00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:14.338
When it starts happening you are amazed
that all around you feel the subtle power of God,

00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:20.470
the power of His love, what we call the
all-pervading Brahma, what we call the Chaitanya.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.354
That’s how you start feeling
it and once you start feeling it

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:30.927
you are amazed that how you can find
about everything. You become like a computer.

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:34.677
As soon as you want to find out whether it
is right or wrong,

00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:38.067
say you want to ask a question,” Is there God?”

00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:40.768
Immediately you’ll find there
will be cool breeze coming out.

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:45.581
But if You want to find about Hitler, you might
get a blister or a heat on your hands

00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:47.654
and you’ll feel horrible about it.

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:53.434
So that is how you start working it out
and gradually you become absolutely wise

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:57.444
in the sense you become absolute and you understand.

00:03:57.524 --> 00:04:02.105
Just now if you look at a person how will
you find out who is right and who is wrong?

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:06.442
But when this happens to you, you don’t
have to know about him.

00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:11.113
On his centres you know because
you become collectively conscious.

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:13.298
You become, again I say, it is a becoming,

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:17.447
You become collectively conscious,
you can know about your own centres

00:04:17.527 --> 00:04:19.841
and you can know about the centres of others.

00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:24.604
And when you feel the centres of
others, you know what the problem is,

00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:29.263
you don’t talk like other people talk,
but you talk in the language of centres.

00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:34.774
This is exactly what happened to the disciples of
Christ when they were blessed by the Holy Ghost,

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:38.934
the cool breeze came on them, they
started speaking in strange languages.

00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:42.468
And the same thing you’ll find
with Sahaja Yogis that they speak

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:47.312
in a strange language in the sense that
they talk in the language of the centres,

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:51.991
and they start using their hands in a way
because the hand has got the power flowing,

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:57.618
and they use it to bind it up and that looks very
strange and at that time also it looked very strange

00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:03.373
so people started saying that they are mad people,
they are doing some sort of funny actions.

00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:10.493
So all this happens, it’s very simple, has to
happen, the time has come, it is the blossom time;

00:05:10.573 --> 00:05:17.374
at that time I would say, in the
early days, it was not the blossom time

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:22.660
but it was the time when there were
hardly one or two flowers on the tree of life,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.889
but today is different-there are so many seekers all
over the world though mislead by all kinds of things
