1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


5
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,892
1984-0708 Public Program 2 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth PP 2

6
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,892
Now, again today, I would like you to ask Me some questions.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,892
There is going to be the fourth lecture, that they will announce.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,892
I hope you will make it a point to come and complete the series of lectures we have been having.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,892


10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:49,892
Q1. [INAUDIBLE]

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,892
A1. It’s true. It has been told that you must have a Guru.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,892
But it’s said that it has to be a Satguru. Anybody you see, mostly,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,892
the gurus who are in the market today. You cannot be in the market,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,892
and those who are in the market are actually, are nowhere near God.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,892
They have to be Satguru, means he has to be a realized soul of a very high degree.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,892


17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,892
Now you better become your own Guru. And then you will know that you are a Satguru.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,892
I am the Mother, I am not a Guru. And what is Mother’s desire is? You had a mother also.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,892
Whatever I have, you better have it. That’s all.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,892
So as you have come to Mother, now you don’t ask for any guru, you better become yourself a Guru. All right?

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,892
Q2. [INAUDIBLE]

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,892
A2. No. You see, you must know that the Kundalini awakening itself, breaking through and all that,

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,892
is a big happening. A key event of evolution, the epitome of it, as you know,

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,892
as an Indian you know how Sakshatkar is such a big thing. But to achieve that,

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,892
there must be a big machinery within us. Like you see the electrical bulb here, or a light here,

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,892
you know there is a history behind it, and it is a big mechanism and organization that has worked it out.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,892
In the same way to achieve this there’s a big organization.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,892
So, when you become realized, that will happen very soon to you.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,892
Means you’ll feel the cool breeze coming out of the Brahmarandra, through your fontanel bone area.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,892
But then to develop it, you have to understand, deeper, the mechanism.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,892
Then the mantras are placed according to the deities of these seven chakras.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,892
Now if the Kundalini is stopping, or is weak at a point, any one of these chakras,

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,892
then you have to say a particular mantra for that. Which will be told to you,

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,892
which you can learn very easily. And you will know also about all the mantras that are to be said.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,892
Like, you see, many gurus I have seen give away one mantra. Like they say Ram.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,892
How can that be? You see, there are seven chakras, and if you take Ram,

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,892
he’s on the right side of the heart chakra, means [UNKNOWN SANSKRIT WORD].

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,892
Now, if you are taking the name of Rama, why, why Rama’s name?

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,892
Ask a question to him, you must ask a question. Why Rama’s name, why not Krishna’s?

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,892
Why not Jesus? The reason is, if he’s a Satguru he’ll tell you,

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,892
that you have a problem with your right heart. But all of them here, those who are realization souls,

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,892
can tell you where is the problem. And you will also tell tomorrow.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,892
Q3. [INAUDIBLE]

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,892
A3. No, it’s not. There are seven mantras actually. Basically you must know about seven mantras.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,892
But gradually, you pick it up in no time, because immediately you know where the problem is,

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,892
and immediately you say the mantra. It’s not very difficult, it’s very simple.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,892
It is woven in a pattern and it’s very simple to say those mantras.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,892
But it works out so spontaneously, I mean, these are all people who are English

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,892
and Greeks and this and that, and they don’t know. Even, we can say mantras in English language now.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,892
That’s an advancement I think. That all the deities can understand English language as well.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,892
So you can say it in Sanskrit or in English, it’s all right, it works out.

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,892
And, once you know it, it’s so easy to say it, easy to understand. It’s not a problem at all.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,892
But first of all you should get your realization, that’s first thing.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,892
That is you should break through, you see, the seed must break. [INAUDIBLE], its primule must break.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,892
Then the second thing is to see that it sustains itself above the ground.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,892
Then it is to be maintained and developed until you become a tree.

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,892
But it’s very simple, it’s not difficult.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,892
Q4. [INAUDIBLE]

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,892
A4. When you get your realization you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,892
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands. Then you can ask a question,

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,892
is this the breeze of the Adi Shakti? Is this the Chaitanya Lahari of the Adi Shakti?

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,892
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti actually.

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,892
Nobody has explained to them, they don’t know. I mean, they asked the Archbishop of Canterbury

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,892
about Holy Ghost, he said “I’m agnostic,” can you imagine?

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,892
Yes, he answered. I mean, if he’s agnostic this Robin Day asked him

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,892
“So what are you doing here?” So he said “I’m doing my job.” So Robin Day said

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,892
“Yes” because he also does the job. He understood it. [HINDI].

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,892
Now the problem is that when you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,892
you might find that after some time it goes away then comes. See, depends on.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,892
Some people have a express train, as we call it.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,892
But some of them have some bogeys, which go up and down. It doesn’t matter.

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,892
We should not frustrate on that point, it works out. One should not get unhappy about it.

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:21,892
Q5. [INAUDIBLE]

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,892
A5. Subconscious. Of course, I mean the same. I am the Self, I am the Spirit, yes.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,892
Like, I’ll tell you, in the bible, Christ clearly said it, very clearly, we don’t read bible that way,

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,892
that’s why. That Nicodemus, you see, He told Nicodemus that you are to be born again.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,892
So, Nicodemus said that does that mean that I should enter into the womb of my mother.

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,892
He said no, that is flesh, and the flesh is born out of, whatever is born out of flesh is flesh.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,892
You are to be born of your Spirit. And whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit He said.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,892
But how many people follow that? That’s the consciousness I’m talking of, the real Selfhood.

81
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,892
What we do, in the churches, or in our Indian, any one of the religions that we have.

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,892
We put the water on the head, now you are baptized, you are a Christian.

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,892
For a Hindu they put a string, now you are a Brahmin, without knowing a word about Brahma.

84
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,892
[INAUDIBLE]. So now, there is reality.

85
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,892
All these people didn’t tell us lies you see, never told us lies.

86
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,892
But the truth is always covered by the intellectuals, by the intelligent people on one side

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,892
and by the fanatics on the other side, and that’s why the problem comes in.

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:14,892
Q6. [INAUDIBLE]

89
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,892
A6. You see, because, what happens that intellectuals rationalize it.

90
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,892
They say whatever we see, we see the science, so we don’t want to believe.

91
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,892
Now recently there has been a controversy about Christ miracles, isn’t it.

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,892
There, lets take this thing very recently, there’s a controversy about Christ’s being born of a virgin.

93
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,892
He was born of a virgin, no doubt, but how can you convince an intellectual you see,

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,892
because He cannot be born of a virgin. But He was born.

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,892
All these miracles are absolute truth, no doubt.

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,892
So the problem is they want to see through science. Now science is analytical,

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,892
it is not does the synthesis. Science deals with the dead.

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,892
It deadens everything, it analyzes, and whatever you see you think it’s the truth, no,

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,892
but it’s just a part of the truth. Now why do they accept?

100
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,892
See now, big challenge, is intellectual. This was Mr Paul, who came in.

101
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,892
When I was a child I asked My father, who is this Paul?

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,892
My father, being a very great realized soul himself, he said, he was another mad man.

103
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,892
And this Paul had never seen Christ. What we call, he had a supraconscious,

104
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,892
a kind of a [CONDITION or POSITION?], he got blind and all that.

105
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,892
And then he became, he was a horrible man, he killed so many Jews,

106
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,892
he killed the young boys for [STEALING?] you know he did all sorts of things and then suddenly,

107
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,892
he becomes a big Christian. Because he saw some sort of a political thing in that.

108
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,892
So what does he say, he doesn’t talk of Christ as He was, he talks of a Christ

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,892
which was the church Christ, the Christ of the church.

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,892
Now, Christ of the church has nothing to do with real Christ, has nothing to do.

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,892
So now, because they have to accept, the churches have to accept Paul,

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,892
they cannot accept Christ. It’s a good idea. Either accept Christ, or accept,

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,892
this is what happens with intellectuals. Even in India it has happened.

114
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,892
I’ll tell you when, when Adi Shankaracharya, he wrote a book called Viviketurya.

115
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,892
It’s a great treatise. About Athvaida [BEST GUESS] he said that God is everything,

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,892
Brahma is everything. A beautiful treatise he wrote. So there was a fellow called Vishra,

117
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,892
Mandan Vishra [BEST GUESS], is a great learned man, another intellectual,

118
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,892
he came to argue with him. And he argued and argued and argued,

119
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,892
you see with argument where do you reach? You cannot by arguing give realization to somebody.

120
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,892
And he said, “Why don’t you take your realization?” But he argued,

121
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,892
he said “You defeat me.” He said “I don’t want to defeat you I want to give you realization,

122
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,892
why don’t you take your realization?” He would not take the realization.

123
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,892
So, the intellectual, you see, tortured his life. He was so fed up, Adi Shankaracharya.

124
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,892
The book he wrote was Saundarya Lahiri, if you ever happen to read it,

125
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,892
it’s nothing but the praise of the Mother, throughout. He said this is how [SANSKRIT]

126
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,892
not by yoga by Sankara [BEST GUESS] by discussion, it’s only through Mother’s grace

127
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,892
you are going to get realization [INAUDIBLE].

128
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,892
So the intellectuals, you see, want to derive a pleasure of an intellectual feat out of most if it.

129
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,892
It’s not the real that they are seeking. They read, a lot, achieve nothing.

130
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,892
I have known people who are very learned, who have written many books

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,892
and they are so horribly immoral within their private life you can’t believe it that they could be philosophers.

132
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,892
And you don’t understand, how can you be, why are you so hypocritical? But they are.

133
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,892
Because they are not realized souls. And an ordinary person, you find a realized soul.

134
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,892
Just uneducated. That’s why Kabira has said Pari Pari Pundita Mura Kabai,

135
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,892
by reading too much you learned have become stupid. But I don’t say all learned are stupid.

136
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,892
No. But learning should reach that supreme power of intelligence, which is pure intelligence.

137
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,892
Then obviously you see the thing and you accept if you are honest as I said in the beginning.

138
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,892
You must have that pure intelligence to see, God is there.

139
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,892
He’s above everything, he’s above your intelligence, above your thoughts.

140
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,892
You have to feel him first, you have to rise. That is the transformation, if you cannot achieve,

141
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,892
then how can I talk to you? If a person is blind,

142
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,892
what’s the use of talking about colors to a blind person, what does he understand?

143
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,892
He can’t even see whether I’m smiling or laughing or if I’m crying. What can you talk?

144
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,892
So the eyes must be open, and these eyes which I’m talking of are above your thought.

145
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,892
You cannot by your projection get it.

146
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,892
It has to come to you. It’s a grace. Ashedvard [BEST GUESS].

147
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,892
Q7. [INAUDIBLE]

148
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,892
A7. No You see what I would suggest that what happens that once you get your realisation

149
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,892
then I have seen a person who has developed the intellect,

150
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,892
understands it in an intellectual way what realization is

151
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,892
and a person who is not supposed to be so intelligent starts talking like saints.

152
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,892
I had gone to a village in India and there was a person who was, I was going on a bullock cart,

153
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,892
he was driving Me and I asked him when he did you get your realization

154
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,892
and then he started talking to Me. I said “Kabira is driving Me or what?”

155
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,892
How is he talking like this?” The truth, tremendous, what intelligence.

156
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,892
How much Christ studied in what university?

157
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,892
So we should not misunderstand intelligence I mean the divine intelligence,

158
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,892
that’s a very different thing.

159
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:25,892
Q8. [INAUDIBLE]

160
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,892
A8. You are, all the time, if you, Shaktipad [BEST GUESS] is the word they use it,

161
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,892
Shaktipad you see, but it is very much misused. Shaktipad means people start dancing like mad,

162
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,892
they start shouting screaming how can that be Shaktipad? That’s madness, that’s possession,

163
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,892
you get possessed. Shaktipad means if somebody is a Shakti,

164
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,892
you see the Shakti of that person enters into your being and invites your Kundalini

165
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,892
so the Kundalini rises. That’s what actually it is

166
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,892
and then the Kundalini rises and makes you a beautiful person

167
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,892
it doesn’t make you a mad person no how can it be?

168
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,892
Just imagine now after evolving yourself from amoeba and all the donkeys

169
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,892
and all the monkeys and what else, oh, cockroaches are you going to become a mad person?

170
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,892
Or a frog, jumping like that.

171
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,892
So this is very much, that’s why I don’t use very much Shaktipad power because these days

172
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,892
every Dick, Tom and Harry is using you see. Shaktipad that’s not what I mean.

173
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,892
Shaktipad means if somebody has Shakti it just works.

174
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,892
You don’t go and put it in the head of that person, it just flows, all right?

175
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,892
But it was used in Patanjali’s day in that way but who reads Patanjali? Nobody reads I think

176
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,892
nobody reads and talks about it. What they talk is some sort of a head standing

177
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,892
some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE SHEERSH] asana that’s all. I mean that’s we, we, we, part of it.

178
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,892
Nobody reads him I mean if you read it, I mean, [INAUDIBLE] you see what he has written is

179
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,892
that’s what I am doing. I am quite surprised how people talk about this thing.

180
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,892
What he says you achieve [SANSKRIT] means you become effortless

181
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,892
first [SANSKRIT] you become without thoughtless,

182
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,892
then the third thing he says you become complete negation of thought, [SANSKRIT].

183
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,892
But here it is they are all jumping, talking big, this, that, how can that be?

184
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,892
Meditation means jumping in the air, how can it be? [HINDI]

185
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,892
Indians understand thank God, Indians are that way you see, safe.

186
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,892
But there should be seeking in India. You see these people are seeking

187
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,892
and striving and they are the ones who want it, I must tell you very frankly

188
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,892
they are the people who really are nicely seeking, in England I am saying not in India.

189
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:21,892
But Indians are not seeking that, but they have one great thing in them is that they know what is reality.

190
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,892
They understand. You see like some of the people who went to a Guru,

191
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,892
I must tell you, and he gave them a mantra for which he charged £300 in secret, in the ears,

192
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,892
nobody to be told. And the mantra was “Tinga”. “Tinga” and they told Me in the ear

193
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,892
and I couldn’t help laughing, “Tinga” means showing like this to someone.

194
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,892
And he used to giggle at people because they were all so stupid, poor things,

195
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,892
but they were seekers, real seekers, you know,

196
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,892
of such high quality and this fellow who told Me was a barrister can you imagine?

197
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:24,892
Q9. [INAUDIBLE]

198
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,892
A9. Yes, you are part, you are part of the whole. You are part and parcel of the whole.

199
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,892
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm,

200
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,892
as we say in Sanskrit is Virata, you become part and parcel of that Virata.

201
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:56,892
Q10. [INAUDIBLE]

202
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,892
A10. No, no, no. [INAUDIBLE] Correct.

203
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,892
See it may look like that because the myth of responsibility drops out.

204
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,892
Supposing, this wire thinks that it is responsible for what I am speaking,

205
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,892
does it become more efficient? Say, what responsibility we have is like this.

206
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,892
When we are going by a plane, question is very good, I have seen it. I mean actually,

207
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,892
it must be understood in its full context it’s correct that when you think it is the responsibility of God

208
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,892
you see, then you become irresponsible.

209
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,892
On the contrary, you become an instrument into his hands you see.

210
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,892
But you don’t think that you are doing it yourself, like you are sitting in the play.

211
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,892
I give this example many a times because I have seen this happen.

212
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,892
Some villagers never knew how to go by plane so they were told not to take too much luggage.

213
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,892
They sat in the plane and put all their luggage on their heads.

214
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,892
Carrying the responsibility of the plane, saying that we have to carry the load

215
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,892
because we don’t want the plane to carry all our loads you see.

216
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,892
So that myth drops out, that myth drops out.

217
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,892
But you become a very efficient person

218
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,892
because the energy that’s divine starts dynamically working, manifesting.

219
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,892
You become a dynamic person, you can do a thousand and one things

220
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,892
which you have never done before, because you have become a perfect instrument.

221
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,892
You are not perfect as long as you think you are doing it, you see My point?

222
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:59,892
All of them, those who are realised souls, and you will be too.

223
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,892
What work are they doing, is spiritually they are doing a lot of work, now,

224
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,892
that’s another side when you’ll come to Sahaja Yoga we’ll tell you what work they are doing.

225
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,892
You see what work you want us to do may not be the work that we are doing

226
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,892
but we are transforming people. We are saving people from cancers and so many diseases,

227
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,892
we are transforming them, we are changing them so much that they have given up drugs.

228
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,892
So many people have given up alcohol, all these bad habits have dropped out.

229
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,892
So many people are cured of so many diseases, so many diseases we have cured already,

230
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,892
when you come to us we will let you know as to what substantial work it is. all right?

231
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,892
Starvation of course, our starvation. Why people are starving also

232
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,892
because I think people who drink are starving because they waste their money in drink.

233
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,892
If they haven’t, if they have money why should they drink?

234
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,892
If they don’t have money why should they drink? But most of the people starve themselves

235
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,892
because they spend all their money, in UK I am saying, not in India, India is a different thing.

236
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,892
But in India people who have got realization are blessed they don’t starve anymore.

237
00:24:14,000 --> 00:28:29,892
[INAUDIBLE]

238
00:28:30,000 --> 00:24:30,892
They don’t need anything, it is said that Yoga Kshema Wiam Miam,

239
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,892
first you get your yoga, your union with God and then I will bless you. Kshema.

240
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,892
[INAUDIBLE]

241
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,892
Yes, yes, of course, of course you can pay your rates, everything,

242
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,892
but you just come and see before. This is the intellectual side, come inside and see,

243
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,892
whether it works out or not. Why not see? Don’t argue for arguments sake, it works out.

244
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,892
There’s somebody sitting behind you who has, in his life it has worked out, just behind.

245
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,892
In many lives it has worked out but you come and see for yourself what miracles it has, all right?

246
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,892
You come and see all previous things just drop off.

247
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,892
Come and see how God is blissful after all the blessings come from God.

248
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,892
But we don’t want to do anything for God and why not God look after us,

249
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,892
what have you done for God so far. Can I ask a question?

250
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,892
Everyone has right to ask a question to Me, I better ask you all. What have you done for God?

251
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:59,892
Just surrender it. [INAUDIBLE] You are afraid? [INAUDIBLE] Afraid of God? [INAUDIBLE] Pray?

252
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,892
But what we pray to God is “Give me my food. Give me a job.

253
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:19,892
God get me this. Let me win this war. Let’s kill my enemies” I know all those prayers.

254
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:37,892


255
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,892
Q11. [INAUDIBLE]

256
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,892
A11. First you get connected all right. First let us get connected then you will know.

257
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,892
Then you will know what He wants and what He does.

258
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,892
Then you will know He is very kind man, very kind,

259
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,892
extremely forgiving that the way He has forgiven us for whatever we have done.

260
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,892
But don’t feel guilty for it, that’s one thing I didn’t want to start,

261
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,892
because you see that’s one trouble you all have is to feel guilty and I don’t want you to feel guilty

262
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,892
because realization doesn’t work out.

263
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:29,892
Don’t feel guilty it’s all right. We’ll have it next time madam, is it something important?

264
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:56,892
Q12. [INAUDIBLE]

265
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,892
A12. Talk. Talking is not the thing,

266
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,892
you see what I would say you should see the way they talk has nothing to do,

267
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,892
what you have to see, what have you achieved yourself.

268
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,892
Whatever people may talk is they might be talking because they are possessed, that’s all.

269
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,892
If somebody talks big be careful, be careful, the one who does, isn’t.

270
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,892
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head is the point I said that nobody can do,

271
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,892
can anybody do that?

272
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:43,892
Those who talk can be good actors at the most, at the worst they are possessed. [INAUDIBLE]

273
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:54,892
Q13. [INAUDIBLE]

274
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,892
A13. Your married life improves immensely.

275
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,892
Because you will learn later on there is a centre for it and you understand your married life as a bliss,

276
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,892
it’s absolutely pure blessings to married people. Actually you will be surprised

277
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,892
we can’t give realization to people who are not married, in the sense

278
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,892
who are going to marry is all right. But those who are against marriage we can’t give realization

279
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,892
because they are a little imbalanced.

280
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,892
I think the one we had you see, we couldn’t give realization, I hope he’s not here.

281
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,892
But he is going to get married so we will give him realization,

282
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,892
we just couldn’t give him, but married life improves like this.

283
00:29:45,000 --> 00:30:04,892
Q14. [INAUDIBLE]

284
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:17,892
A 14. What is it about Bhagwan? [HINDI]

285
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,892
This kind of a Bhagwan, who cannot even smell a flower. Can you think of a Bhagwan like that?

286
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,892
You know in the Devi Mahatmayam or into the Vishnu Shastranama,

287
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,892
or anyone of them where there is a described God at least twenty five names of God is he’s fond of flower, fragrance, flower.

288
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,892
I can’t live without flowers and the fellow who cannot smell a flower [HINDI]

289
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,892
I mean what do you give him? Phenyl or something?

290
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:12,892
This is one of the tests. How can you be a Bhagwan? [SANSKRIT] These are the names of God.

291
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:33,892
Q15. [INAUDIBLE]

292
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,892
A15. You see, say now if I give you Indian money say 100 rupees how do you know it is 100 rupees?

293
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,892
You have to go to India and spend it and see if it works out or not.

294
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,892
In the same way when you get the vibrations and you feel the cool breeze you spend it

295
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,892
and see for yourself and judge it.

296
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,892
You can do the whole process yourself, you can give realization to others all right?

297
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,892


298
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,892
You see now I would say please get your realization, if you get it, I don’t promise, if you get it.

299
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,892
That’s a very big if, sometimes. I know it happens if you get it

300
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,892
then you have to go and see for yourself whether it works or not.

301
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,892
But to get it is not easy in certain cases,

302
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,892
so be cheerful about it and be patient with yourself.

303
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,892
More patience is needed with yourself, not with Me because I am extremely patient.

304
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,892
You have to be patient with yourself because your mind will be coming up and always saying something,

305
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,892
you didn’t ask this question, you should have asked this question, tell your mind to be quiet.

306
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,892
Take your realization, lets see if it works out.

307
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,892
We cannot assure, it may, it may not, it’s your luck, that’s it.

308
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:27,892
Q16. [INAUDIBLE]

309
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,892
A16. This conscious mind that you have just now is the human awareness, all right,

310
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,892
at this point the human awareness is at such a stage, that you are not connected with your spirit.

311
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,892
First your human awareness has to be raised it has to be brought to that point

312
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,892
where you get connected. Like this instrument is here now,

313
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,892
consciously whatever you do with this it is not connected, it has no meaning.

314
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,892
In the same way first you should be connected.

315
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,892
After connecting only we can see where is the problem is, what is missing, what is it

316
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,892
and is to be done. So we have to take a very reasonable attitude towards it,

317
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,892
about ourselves, to understand that maybe there is something missing,

318
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,892
something is happening, it’s not working out.

319
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,892
Because at this awareness, at this consciousness that you have, this human consciousness is not sufficient.

320
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,892
So you have to jump, there’s a breakthrough, and you have to achieve that breakthrough.

321
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,892
Which I will not promise, as I told that gentleman there you, it cannot be promised,

322
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,892
it has to be achieved. If you get it then you have to have patience with yourself work it out and see for yourself.

323
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:47,892
Q17. [INAUDIBLE]

324
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,892
A17. Yes They did because that was the time you see.

325
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,892
Now Jesus came at a time when our Agnya chakra was opened,

326
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,892
see it’s like a Tree of Life has to grow you see and They come at a proper time what has to grow.

327
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,892
Now if it’s the root time and somebody else came in, when the shoot started

328
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,892
somebody else came in gradually it has come up to this point. Now Mohammed,

329
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,892
what Mohamed has said, nobody says that today.

330
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,892
All the Muslims must know that He said “At the time of the resurrection your hands must speak”,

331
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,892
where is that? He said it I mean nobody else but Mohammed had said so clearly about it.

332
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,892
And what does He say is not known nobody knows why He said [INAUDIBLE-namas] like this.

333
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,892
Nobody asked questions, why do you follow?

334
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,892
But after Sahaja yoga will know what [INAUDIBLE] what Mohammed means,

335
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,892
who He was and why He said so what is so important about it.

336
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,892
You can’t understand even Mohammed or anyone, Jesus or anyone, without realization

337
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,892
because you have not entered into that rank, you see My point.

338
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,892
Because the time that time was not to say whatever They had to do They did very important work very, very important.

339
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,892
Every one of Them have worked very hard.

340
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,892
Only I must say that today I am at an advantage than They are

341
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,892
because so many are getting self-realization. They had a very bad time.

342
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,892
They had a very bad time nobody accepted Them. All acceptance came later on when

343
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,892
They were not there and people liked to have such acceptance

344
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,892
because they can do what they like. They don’t want to,

345
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,892
nobody asked Them for realization at that time, nobody, everybody tried just to kill Them.

346
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,892
I mean everybody was anxious how to get rid of Them, isn’t it a fact?

347
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,892
Like today as there are so many who want their realization that time was not there.

348
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,892
Today is the time, all right?

349
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:29,892
Q18. [INAUDIBLE]

350
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,892
A18. You see that you don’t even need one minute for that, to say, “I’m born again”

351
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,892
it is all self-opinionated thing, just to say. But you have to have powers you see

352
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,892
that’s what I told you the whole lecture was like that.

353
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,892
That once you get self realised you get the powers you have collective consciousness you become conscious.

354
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,892
You see it is very easy to say, just to put the, I don’t know how much they pay

355
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,892
but you just put the name membership “I’m born again”. You don’t know this born again people,

356
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,892
horribly hot tempered, useless people absolutely. You see some of them brought some bibles

357
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,892
and one lady bearing all artificial jewellery here and there and she came to give Me the bible

358
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,892
and I just ignored her. I just started laughing and she was quite surprised to hear this sound.

359
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,892
So this is what born again how can they be born again if they can’t make out a saint.

360
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,892
How can they be born again? [INAUDIBLE]

361
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:35,892


362
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,892
Only the truth will survive. All these are fads and things [INAUDIBLE] it has no meaning.

363
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
END
