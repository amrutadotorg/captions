1
00:00:00,858 --> 00:00:04,198
Now the question he asked me

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:09,666
was in the nature of a entire of a person

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:19,003
who wants to find out, what is the proof that there is God.

4
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:26,601
I How are we to convince people, what is God?

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:33,007
That we have to achieve something, as far as God is concerned?

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,906
How are we to convince them
that we have got all these centers within us

7
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:44,021
and that you have to achieve that realization?

8
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:46,989
And also how are we to prove to others that

9
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:49,565
you have achieved your realization?

10
00:00:53,673 --> 00:00:55,856
This is the question

11
00:00:56,521 --> 00:01:00,544
which everyone who is not yet a fully Sahaja Yogi

12
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:04,567
would feel and ask you questions and you should all

13
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:06,345
answers to it.

14
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:12,026
The first and foremost question is

15
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:14,516
how do we prove that there is God?

16
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,769
Because you assumed that there is God

17
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,670
because somebody has said, “There is God.”

18
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:29,747
Now what are the ways of proving this that there is God?

19
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:35,808
So we have to attack the question,

20
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:40,543
first from the reasoning point of you

21
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:45,570
that we should be able to tell people that there is God

22
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,789
through reason not through experiencing

23
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,201
because they are to be prepared.

24
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:58,429
There will be many who really do not believe

25
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:02,759
in God but just out of fashion they’re saying “All right we accept”

26
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:07,295
because they want to keep up peace and the compromise.

27
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:15,782
But how you start about convincing them rationally?

28
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,499
Perhaps I spoke in one of My lectures if you have that,

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,800
I don’t know if you have got it.

30
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:26,830
But we can prove it – the existence of God.

31
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:32,132
You may call it God or nature or whatever it is,

32
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:34,348
from many point of view.

33
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:37,731
For example in short we can say,

34
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:41,235
“There are many scientific things we cannot explain”.

35
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:50,469
We cannot explain how the periodic laws were established

36
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:53,307
without somebody being there.

37
00:02:57,144 --> 00:03:01,239
Periodic laws of chemical substances

38
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:07,155
of the elements that exist on this Earth is so regular

39
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:09,122
and so properly plotted down

40
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:11,075
that you can see there must be some plotter

41
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,385
otherwise it cannot be done.

42
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:16,967
I mean if you want to avoid it,
you can avoid it but there must be someone.

43
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:18,834
Say we come in this room

44
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,436
and find everything properly organized,

45
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,730
lit up and we should know there must be somebody who has done it.

46
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:36,518
Then a very good example is given by a very good French biologist,

47
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:41,835
he says that if you use law of chance,

48
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:46,980
the law of chance states that

49
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:52,247
– if you have got fifty red pebbles and fifty white pebbles

50
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:56,984
put in a jar and if you shake that jar

51
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:59,475
it goes into a chaotic condition

52
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:07,776
and the distribution of these pebbles is in a chaotic manner.

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,247
To bring them back to their normal condition of having the red

54
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:18,583
on one side and the white on the other side,

55
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,042
you go on shaking it as many times as you like

56
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,912
and they have found out – there’s

57
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:30,311
minimum of minimum so many times it has to be done

58
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:34,178
otherwise it cannot be worked out.

59
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,395
This is all done by chance.

60
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,303
You see by chance when it has to come to normal condition.

61
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,372
How many chances you have to take?

62
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,151
There’s a certain amount of a formula.

63
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:51,141
Something raised to power ‘n’, call it ‘n’.

64
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,314
So as a biologist he tried to calculate

65
00:04:57,504 --> 00:05:02,001
that if matter has to become living,

66
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:07,518
then to get to that density

67
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,475
how many years are required

68
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:22,431
by the law of chance to bring forth a living cell – one cell?

69
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:28,550
And he found out that billions and billions and billions of years,

70
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,377
if this law of chance works out

71
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:39,540
then only one unicellular animal can be created.

72
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:48,589
But in this short time from when the Earth receded from

73
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:56,881
the Sun and then cooled down and then life came into being,

74
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,307
then human being were created who are very complicated,

75
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,719
it is such a short time,

76
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:06,067
compared to that time which is required by chance.

77
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,969
That he has proved mathematically that it is an impossibility,

78
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,533
it cannot happen.

79
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,065
It is that fantastic.

80
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:19,425
This is a scientific very good proof of a biologist

81
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:23,313
that there is somebody, a juggler, who is doing that job.

82
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:25,058
You may call Him ‘God’;

83
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:29,075
you may call Him ‘Nature’ whatever is, but the nature thinks.

84
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,760
People like Yung have proved

85
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:35,683
the existence of collective consciousness.

86
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:40,310
The existence of unconscious, which gives us dreams

87
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:46,928
through which we get universal symbols.

88
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:53,295
All over the world whether we are in India
or in England or anywhere.

89
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,770
The symbols are the same

90
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:59,695
and he has done experiments with thousands of people.

91
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:03,013
On the medical science also one can say

92
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:08,270
as you know that one of the arguments we put in for is that

93
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:12,482
acetylene and adrenaline

94
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:17,728
which are two chemicals when they are in the body – human body,

95
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,993
they act very arbitrarily.

96
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:22,682
Means they have to augment

97
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,718
– mean to contract or to relax.

98
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:29,691
Those who relax must relax;
those who have to contract must contract.

99
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,783
But those who are supposed to be contracting relax,

100
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:36,845
while those who are supposed to be relaxing contract.

101
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,517
So they have not been able to explain and they have written,

102
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:44,956
all of the doctors, they say that the mode of conduct of these

103
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:48,059
chemicals in the body one cannot say.

104
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:56,880
Another thing is that one of the very very important

105
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:59,782
arguments that people have given is this

106
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:05,506
that supposing a foreign body goes inside the human body,

107
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:09,805
there’s always a tendency to throw it out as soon as possible.

108
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,051
Supposing something goes into your throat, you cough out.

109
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:16,089
Supposing something goes in the blood,
they will try to throw it away.

110
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:21,760
That’s the system it is. But when the fetus is formed in the body,

111
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:27,461
then not only it is kept there, it is nurtured, looked after

112
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:29,923
and thrown out at the right time.

113
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,679
How can you explain that?

114
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:36,908
There are thousand and one explanations

115
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:40,894
people have tried to give but none of them are satisfactory.

116
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:44,289
Then this Earth is spinning with such a speed

117
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:48,698
and we are kept glued to this Earth, we never even feel the speed.

118
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:50,811
And so many things like that

119
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:54,559
people have been able to say and the so many scientists

120
00:08:55,219 --> 00:09:00,308
have felt that, there is some force

121
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,687
which is beyond us which is very dynamic,

122
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,355
which acts in such dynamic ways that we cannot explain.

123
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:11,498
So we come to a point where we tell people

124
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:15,318
that there is some force which we have to discover.

125
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:22,636
Now then as Sahaja Yogis you can say that this hankering to seek.

126
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:27,185
After a certain level of evolution because

127
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:30,100
some people do not have a thirst seeking, you know that.

128
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:33,754
They are just seeking food – to eat just like animals.

129
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,962
Some people are seeking power.

130
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,945
Some people are seeking money also.

131
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:45,439
But there are so many people who are seeking something beyond.

132
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:48,363
This seeking has come to us

133
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,899
and this seeking that has come to us

134
00:09:54,223 --> 00:10:00,722
has led us to some sort of a path by which we should find out.

135
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:06,282
Now you have seen with your naked eyes,
a Kundalini rising at My Feet.

136
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:09,325
You have seen the pulsation of the Kundalini

137
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,522
definitely that nobody can do.

138
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:13,899
There is no mesmerism, nothing.

139
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:20,507
When the Kundalini rises, with the stethoscope

140
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:23,331
you can feel the rising of the Kundalini.

141
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:26,712
With the rising of Kundalini you have known that

142
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:28,922
we have cured people of different diseases.

143
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:31,155
Even a person who was just dying,

144
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:34,168
whom doctor had decided that they are dead

145
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:38,195
and to be buried very soon, have been cured.

146
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:45,232
And it is so dynamic, the dynamism I’ll tell you. It’s so dynamic

147
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:49,626
– like we can take the case of Eddy’s? brother.

148
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:54,105
That he was so very sick and they said,

149
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:57,543
“He has got blood cancer, he’s going to die within eight days”.

150
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:02,621
I mean he just told Me this, that’s all and he’s cured.

151
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:07,644
Then Linda told Me that her mother was always angry with Peter.

152
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:17,650
[Mother speaks aside – “Where is she gone? Where is she? Linda!”]

153
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:27,218
– So she told Me that

154
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,615
the mother would never talk to Peter,

155
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,629
she was very angry with him always, she would never talk to him.

156
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:37,707
But she told Me all these things

157
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:40,832
and suddenly she found that now she’s become very good

158
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:43,355
and congenial and nice and talking.

159
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:47,907
You have seen such transformations coming

160
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,469
among many, many, many people.

161
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:53,388
How people are changing, transforming,

162
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:56,475
this is absolutely dynamic; you cannot do it.

163
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:01,743
So many sick people are suddenly cured

164
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:04,524
only through attention you know.

165
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,196
There must be something about it

166
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:14,355
and that is how you have to convince

167
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:23,402
people about Sahaja.

168
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,731
But after getting realization

169
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:31,577
you just see the Kundalini, you see the rising of the Kundalini.

170
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,628
You also feel the vibrating force of Kundalini.

171
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,509
You also see how you got cured,

172
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:41,544
how you got out of your problems?

173
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:50,644
How you were in trouble? What problems you had?

174
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,902
You had seen all these things

175
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,718
and these things happen to you also.

176
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:02,074
Some of you were drug addicts,

177
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:05,548
some of you were suffering from some mental troubles.

178
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:08,071
Some were having physical problems.

179
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:13,648
All these, you see, are cured and you are much better people now.

180
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,936
This has happened to you very easily

181
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:22,726
without much effort being put into.

182
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:26,882
It is not possible to get rid of these things easily.

183
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,132
Definitely you can raise the Kundalini, you can feel the Kundalini.

184
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:38,791
You can you know for definite that when you say that person has got

185
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,630
this left Swadishthana

186
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,495
or anything everybody says the same and you are sure of it.

187
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:48,625
It is not possible for everyone to say the same thing,

188
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:51,013
even the children saying the same thing about a person

189
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,348
and he says also it is verified.

190
00:13:54,753 --> 00:14:02,826
So part of it comes to you in complete proof

191
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:06,096
that there is something about it.

192
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:13,402
Second part also comes to you as a proof

193
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:18,593
because now you know there are vibrations flowing into you.

194
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:20,705
There’s no jugglery about it.

195
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:26,913
And then you can feel it very clearly.

196
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:31,420
You have raised the Kundalini of many people.

197
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:36,052
You have given them realization; 
even the photograph has given realization.

198
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,409
You know for definite it is so.

199
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:47,495
And also you know that if you want to ask any fundamental questions

200
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:52,503
you get answer as a great flow of vibrations.

201
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:55,039
So when you ask the question

202
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,096
[Mother speaks aside].

203
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:04,525
When you ask the question, “Whether there is God?”,

204
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:10,491
immediately you get tremendous vibrations proving that there is.

205
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:17,346
You ask the some questions, which you know for definite

206
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,660
and say, “Is it so?”

207
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:25,895
And you know that it is not so,

208
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:29,218
definitely you do not get any vibrations.

209
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,938
That’s how relatively you know

210
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,601
when do you get vibrations when you don’t get vibrations.

211
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,331
If you ask a very big fundamental question,

212
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:41,354
you get vibrations of a very strong nature.

213
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,508
But in ordinary things you might get a little.

214
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:48,530
So it proves that the vibrations speak to you as vibrations.

215
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,460
This should prove

216
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,200
that there is God because you have asked on vibrations

217
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:01,476
and you have found that there are vibrations

218
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,133
and that there is God.

219
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,692
Now what happened in the case of Buddha

220
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,383
that He got realization as you got it

221
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:18,687
and He had no way of finding out whether there is God or not.

222
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,202
So He said, “There is no God, only there is ‘self'”.

223
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:25,018
But you have gone beyond it.

224
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:34,101
So if you find seventy percent of the proof through your

225
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:38,703
own experiencing it and raising of the Kundalini and all that.

226
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:42,777
Then the thirty percent, whatever it is, is to be ascertained

227
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:44,547
through the vibrations.

228
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,130
And when you ascertain it through the vibrations

229
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,440
– for example I say, “This is hot”.

230
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,647
How do I know? By feeling it itself, it is hot.

231
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,735
Now anything that makes Me hot is hot.

232
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,810
But relatively I know this is hot, that is hot, that is cold.

233
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:04,163
In the same way on vibrations also

234
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:08,579
you can ask various questions and find out ‘yes’ and ‘no’

235
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,487
and then you can believe it –

236
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,045
that there is God Almighty

237
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:18,728
and this all pervading power exists,

238
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:23,141
not only exists but operates, the rest of it is all a myth.

239
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:32,895
But when you rise in Sahaja Yoga being Sahaja,

240
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,372
you take it for granted,

241
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:41,138
as we take everything for granted. All the trees growing,

242
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,443
the mango tree giving a mango,

243
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:48,261
guava tree only gives guavas.

244
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:52,993
We never try to find out how in one little seed

245
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,440
so much is built in, so much is programmed.

246
00:17:57,446 --> 00:18:01,742
We take it for granted all these great miracles of the world.

247
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:06,393
In the same way we take this miracle also for granted.

248
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,467
This is what ‘maya’ is.

249
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:13,567
That is makes everything look so simple and straight.

250
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:17,015
And you just start taking it for granted.

251
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:25,670
Then you have to understand that it is not to be taken for granted

252
00:18:30,157 --> 00:18:38,587
but is to be very much respected, worshipped and accepted.

253
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:47,906
The amount of preparation you have,

254
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:50,498
the amount of strength you have,

255
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:54,749
that is the amount of truth you are going to get.

256
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:59,262
Truth also weighs you very clearly

257
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:02,008
whether you can receive it or not.

258
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:09,497
There is no diplomacy that can work this out.

259
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,182
No cheating, nothing.

260
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,250
Truth knows how far you are.

261
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:18,660
The more you become stronger,

262
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,528
the more the truth manifest through you

263
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,943
and you receive the truth.

264
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:30,362
Just now some of you are still little babies of

265
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:33,866
three months and four months and something like that.

266
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:38,410
And still sometimes taken for granted

267
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:43,488
you do things which you should not do

268
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,176
and harm yourself.

269
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:47,846
Its only question of harming yourself

270
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,052
not harming Me or harming Sahaja Yoga,

271
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:53,088
which cannot be harmed, but you harm yourself.

272
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:56,096
So one has to be very careful

273
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,202
one should understand the laws and regulations

274
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:03,629
as Gavin had read the last time,

275
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:10,172
the statutes of God’s laws.

276
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:16,295
You must understand how it works.

277
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:22,110
You cannot take law into your hands by taking it for granted.

278
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:28,753
Law operates and it knows everything.

279
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:31,527
It is the law of love.

280
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:36,759
That’s why it allows you to make little mistakes to learn.

281
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,417
But it will not protect you

282
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:43,549
when you start saying that all right I want to do it on my own.

283
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:46,345
“All right”, it says, “All right go ahead”.

284
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:51,046
So one has to know

285
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:55,062
that this law operates not blindly,

286
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:59,756
lovingly and it tries to teach you also sometimes

287
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,763
that don’t do this wrong and don’t do that wrong.

288
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:08,990
But when it comes to real punishment,

289
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,146
the punishment is that this law leaves you alone.

290
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,711
It just lets you go;

291
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,439
the attention recedes,

292
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:24,537
that the worst thing that can happen to anyone.

293
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:29,467
That you are not in the attention of God is the worst thing.

294
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:35,722
So even if you make mistakes doesn’t matter.

295
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:38,980
Pray for the attention of God always

296
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:41,759
because the attention of God is the law

297
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,065
– law of love.

298
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,091
You cannot cheat it, everything is known.

299
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:58,919
Every word you say is known, every word you don’t say is known,

300
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:02,926
every thought that comes in you is known.

301
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:12,588
So purify yourself with love, understanding.

302
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:16,782
Try to purify and tell yourself that I have to purify myself

303
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,598
as much as possible.

304
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:22,450
With purification only you will have the proper strength.

305
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:24,578
If you have not purified,

306
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:28,808
then there won’t be any strength for you to bear the truth.

307
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,923
Once you bear the truth your own life will convince people

308
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,764
that you are Divine.

309
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:40,638
Your face will convince people.

310
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:44,737
Everything that you do will convince people that you are Divine

311
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,389
and whatever you say,

312
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:49,776
people will know it is coming through Divine Force.

313
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,447
May God bless you.
