00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.800
Still

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.180
You're going down, alright. There's no room.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.260
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.700
At the very outset I have to say that truth is what it is

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.920
You cannot change it, you cannot transform it

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.180
and unfortunately at this human awareness, you cannot know what is the truth.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.000
You may describe, you may talk about it

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:59.700
but to know the truth, something more has to happen to you.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.660
Now whatever I'm going to tell you today, you need not accept it blind-folded.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.980
We have had lots of problems with the blind faith

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.380
but if it is proved, then

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.720
as honest people you have to accept it. So please keep your mind open

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.500
like a scientist because

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.900
it's very important to know the Absolute Truth in these modern times.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.060
That's the solution for all our problems

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.300
physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.460
Seekers of Truth are people who have problems of spirituality

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.460
and they don't know what to seek, where to go, how to find it.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.700
They are mislaid by many people because the market is full of such people

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.760
so I would like to tell you what is the truth.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:24.700
The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:32.940
this ego and these conditionings but you are much beyond that, is the spirit.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.460
So the truth is that you have to become the spirit and the second truth is

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:49.460
something we are not aware of at all. We see all these beautiful flowers around us

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.180
and we take them for granted. Actually, it's a miracle to have these different flowers

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:05.560
of different shapes and different fragrance uh.. to come out of the same Mother Earth.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.860
We don't know who works it out, who works out the seasons

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:18.000
or if you ask a doctor, "Who runs your heart?" he'll tell, it's an Autonomous Nervous System

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.220
but if you ask him, "Who is this auto?" he won't be able to tell you.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.960
Who is doing this work, I say, is

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.640
the All-Pervading Divine power of love. We have never known the power of love -

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:46.080
we have only worked with the power of hatred but this is The One that exists all over

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.160
and works in every human-being in the same manner.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.100
As you must have been told about the subtle system that is within us -

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.600
I mean, it's not easy for people to believe that there is another subtle system within us

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.540
but we have to understand that the Creator who has created us

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.840
is the greatest organizer and He must organize something within us to achieve

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.880
our last breakthrough in our evolution.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.540
We have not reached to that point where we can say we know the Absolute Truth

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:38.140
that's why there are so many problems, so many philosophies, so many ideologies and people just fighting among themselves

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.420
even in the name of God.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.240
The people who started all these great religions

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:58.160
like, we can say Moses, Christ, Mohammad Sahab, Rama, Krishna, all of them

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:06.200
knew the Truth and they established their religion

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.160
in a way that shows it is more the evolutionary process they were talking about.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:21.120
They all said that, "The time has to come when you'll get your resurrection." Mohammad Sahab has called is the 'Kiyama',

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.560
in the Bible it's called as the Last 'Judgment'.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.580
They were very great people, I must say, and very pure, extremely pure

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.060
and they never realized what sort of people they're facing,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.700
how people were ignorant about the Divine Power, about the Divinity within themselves.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:53.600
So they propounded many things which were really an impossible task for human-beings to do.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.760
To call yourself a Christian is easy but to follow Christianity is very difficult.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:08.260
Christ has said that, "If one eye commits the sin, you take it out,

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.080
if one hand does something wrong, you take it out."

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:20.920
I haven't seen anybody without one eye or without one hand in the whole Christian Kingdoms I have moved about.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:28.320
So that means that it's not so easy to follow Christ, who was such a pure soul,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.060
who thought all the human-beings were angels or some sort of

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.620
Divine people that they will follow whatever He has said it. Then came Mohammad Sahab and He

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.040
thought that why only the men are being told, why not the women?

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.380
So His sense of morality was more sharp, specially for women.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:14:00.820
He said that, any woman who has bad feelings uh.. towards, I mean, unholy feelings towards another man

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.400
should be buried half-way into the Mother Earth and should be killed with stones

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:17.460
because, perhaps, Mohammad Sahab must have said what Christ has said that you should do it and nobody is going to do it,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.540
so people incharge of religion should do it - imagine!

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.680
If this kind of a law was applied in America, how many women could survive, I don't know.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.500
So, I don't blame them because their idea about human-beings was very different

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:46.840
and they couldn't understand the inability of a human-being to take to something that is higher.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.240
Normally, the tendency is to take to something uh.. destructive,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.380
to take to something that takes you away from reality

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.180
and this, you cannot stop, you cannot tell them don't do it. Many people promise in the morning, "All right, I'll not do it,"

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.700
but they cannot keep to it because they haven't got the light of the Spirit in their life.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:19.160
So we have to have the light of the Spirit in our heart. People talk of peace.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:28.340
There are organizations after organization for peace. I met many people who have got awards for peace

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:34.500
but they are very disturbed people, very angry people, very hot-tempered people -

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.600
I could not imagine how they got this award for peace because there's no peace within.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:48.860
There is a way to achieve that peace within yourself. Unless and until we become peaceful within ourselves

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:56.340
where there is no problem between our heart, our brain and our attention,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.600
then only we could be peaceful. This can be very easily achieved

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.120
through this happening where this power of Kundalini has to rise.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:15.800
It's like a primule in a seed. It's a living process.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:23.200
As you can put a seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself, spontaneously - sahaja.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:31.960
'Saha' means born, 'ja', 'Saha' means with and 'ja' is born - is born with you, this power

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.520
to attain this higher level of awareness

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.580
which in Sanskrit we call it as 'Turiya' or you can say the fourth dimension of awareness.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:50.760
It's not at all difficult, you're all capable of getting that - only thing you have to have earnest desire to get it.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.880
Ofcourse you can't give realization or awakening to people who are

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:06.520
stupid, idiotic or who are arrogant. You have to have earnest desire to achieve that state

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.680
because this power, which we call as Kundalini, is nothing but pure desire

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.640
because other desires are not pure.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:27.560
Today we want to have a car, then we want to have a house, then we want to have a helicopter, I don't know

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:34.420
goes on and on and on. We're never satisfied with what we have . That shows the desires we had

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:40.920
were not pure. The pure desire is to be one with this Divine power.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:49.300
But if this desire, whether you are aware or not aware, is not fulfilled

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:58.240
then you become seekers of truth and this is the state, I find, is now

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.460
in this horrible modern times, is so much evident.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:09.380
In every country I have visited I was surprised, whether it was Islamic or Russian,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:17.840
England, Australia, anywhere, I was surprised that people are earnestly seeking the Truth.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:26.360
They might make mistakes, as I said, they might go to wrong paths but definitely there are seekers

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.580
and restlessly they're seeking the Ultimate, which is the Absolute Truth.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.400
Spirit is the source of Absolute Truth.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:47.620
You cannot know anything without

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:54.500
becoming Self-realized as far as it's own

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:03.740
understanding is, like supposing somebody says that democracy is right, somebody says that uh...

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:12.540
another style of uh.. communism is good or socialism is good on politics or economics, anywhere

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.140
they never agree, even the religions don't want to agree - they want to be exclusive -

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.980
but if you see the thing what Mohammad sahab has written, He never was exclusive.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.900
He talked about Moses, He talked about Christ, He

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.240
talked about Christ's Mother with great reverence, so He was not exclusive.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.620
I don't know how people have found exclusive religions. Must be some sort of a

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:53.520
selfish interest that people started saying this religion is good, that religion is good, that religion is good.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.160
And when we don't know the Absolute Truth, we start believing in all this kind of things.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.620
To believe into anything blindly, is not going to help us.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:13.000
We have to have the insight, insight to see what is really the Truth.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:19.620
So when this happening takes place, what happens is that you feel a cool breeze

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:25.800
of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head. You'll be amazed to know that

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:32.600
the Kundalini is your own mother, individual mother.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:39.680
and She's the reflection of the Holy Ghost within you. She knows everything about you -

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:48.440
your past, your aspirations, everything She knows and She is your individual mother very anxious

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:55.520
to give you your second birth. She has been waiting and waiting and waiting and when

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.420
the chance comes, She really shoots up like a jet, I must say, in this jet age.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.080
Is very surprising, how in these modern times it is working so fast.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:15.800
Maybe the pure desire of people is very strong and it has been predicted that at this time all these things will happen.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:24.000
I must say, you're all very lucky people to be born at this time and that you are seekers

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:32.060
of ancient ages and then you should really get it. And you get it also,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:41.000
you must have faith in yourself. We have no faith in ourselves, not in our identity.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:48.320
We take to all kinds of nonsensical things because we don't know what we are. If we know how glorious we are,

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:55.260
how great we are, what is our potential, what we can do, how many powers we have

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:02.040
then we would not indulge into all these things. We'll not go to that extent

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:10.060
that one becomes really mad and crazy. This identification can be easily found out

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.280
once you know yourself. We know the whole world but we don't know about ourselves.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:21.560
First of all, you will know about your own centers that are. These centers represent

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:28.440
all your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being and on your finger-tips you know,

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:35.100
very clearly, what centers are catching. Now supposing, you know how to cure them

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:43.640
and if you know how to cure for others also, so you can cure yourself and cure others

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:51.660
because you develop a new dimension in your awareness which we call as Collective Consciousness

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:59.820
where you can feel others, very clearly, on your finger-tips. This is your potential, this you have within yourself.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.640
It just starts working and you're amazed how you can feel the centers that are within yourself

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:14.800
and the centers that are with other people. You can feel for the people who are dead, who are living, who are far away

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:21.620
when you grow into your awareness which is, I said, the fourth dimension, then it starts working

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:28.600
and you're amazed the way you can cure yourself and you can cure others.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.780
There are three doctors, who have got MD, in Delhi, for curing incurable diseases

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.720
and now we're trying to put down how many cancer patients have been cured in sahaja yoga.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:49.080
Christ cured so many people. How did He cure, nobody bothers to know and to find out what did He do?

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:55.160
When He cured people, He must be having some powers and what were His powers by which He cured?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.940
There are so many diseases we have which we call incurable, can be easily cured with sahaja yoga.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:08.240
First of all, what we need are people who are evolved

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:15.500
and who are matured in sahaja yoga. Once you're matured, you become an expert

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.940
and also very humble, very compassionate, very loving.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.740
All your temper and all your anger and hatred falls out.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:35.240
It's a fact, I'm not telling you some stories. We have many here, at least, I think, 30% people who're sitting here, have got it.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:41.200
But they dress-up like you, they live like you but they're very peaceful and

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.280
they have given up all that was destructive in them, all that was

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:54.220
spoiling their lives - their married lives are very good, they have beautiful children. So, there's a vision.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:02.180
One can see clearly that this whole world will one day become a beautiful place for all of us to live together happily

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:10.140
and without any uh.. grievances about others. All these

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:17.300
uh.. different ideas of racialism or caste-system and all those,

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.180
will just drop out because you become a universal being.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:30.540
When you go to, say America - you are a sahaja yogi - all the sahaja yogies will come to see you.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.420
One person falls sick, say in Australia,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.120
all the sahaja yogies from all the world will make inquiries and find out how is he?

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:48.720
You have so many who are talking about brotherhood, friendliness but cannot be because there is this

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:56.980
uh.. we can say, a partition within us between the Divine and ourselves

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:05.580
but once you know the Divine, you're amazed to see that the Divinity just gives you that confidence

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:12.460
and that understanding on your Central Nervous System. It is not just talking and lecturing.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:20.020
In Sanskrit the word is 'bodh' from the word 'Buddha', means to know on your Central Nervous System.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:27.960
Even 'Vedas' means 'Vid'. Vid also 
Sanskrit means to know on your Central Nervous System.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.200
The truth is to be known on your Central Nervous System.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:40.620
You don't have to do absurd things for that at all. For example, I was there this year in Chicago and it was very, very cold

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.380
and a gentleman came with a dhoti and all his head was shaved.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.820
I asked him, "In this cold why are you shivering in a dhoti?"

00:26:52.200 --> 00:27:00.220
So he told Me, "My guru has said that if you wear a dhoti, you'll get your Nirvana, you'll get your, your salvation."

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:08.300
"And what about this head of yours?" He said, "Yes. That also he has said that you must shave your head and must have a pigtail

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.300
so you'll get your Nirvana." I said, "How could you believe such a nonsensical thing?"

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:21.640
In India, 80% people wear dhoties, they must already be there and what, what about this shaven head.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:28.420
Kabira has said, "If by shaving head, if you can go to Heaven,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:36.200
what about the lamb which is shaved every uh.. year twice? That would be there already to welcome you."

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:45.440
So all these nonsensical things people try to do meditation and they say that you can rise above

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:53.020
the Mother Earth. What is the need, I don't understand? As it is we have problem of jams and why do you want to

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.720
go on three feet troubling everybody. All these funny ideas

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:06.980
I don't know how people accept and pay thousands and thousands of dollars on that.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:14.200
Actually you must understand that you cannot pay for Divine love, you cannot pay

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.920
because God doesn't understand money, He doesn't understand bank - that's your headache not His.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:29.660
So once you realize that you cannot pay, most of these people will disappear from this earth

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.680
but it's very difficult for human-beings to say that you cannot pay because they want to purchase everything.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.080
Even Me, they would say, "Mother, why shouldn't You take some money?" I said, "But for what, how much are you going to pay?"

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.920
This is something invaluable - you cannot value it, how much are you going to pay?

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:56.000
Then, you don't have to do any exercise for it like standing on your head or doing all kinds of these

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:03.000
asanas and this - it's alright for your health but it's not for achieving

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.360
your ascent. It's not for that. Some people

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:13.660
fast and starve and torture the body, which is absolutely wrong.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:23.340
You see, God Almighty is your Father, Father of all the fathers, all the compassion is with Him.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.820
Which father would like his son to torture because he wants to meet the father?

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.540
So He's the Father of fathers. How will He expect you to torture your body like this?

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:41.340
But this idea from where it has come, I don't know, that you must torture your life just to achieve your ascent.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:50.300
It's very simple, you have to be normal people and as normal people, you get your Self-realization.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.700
Self-realization, you can say, goes into two unnh..stages.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:02.280
First you achieve a state when you are thoughtlessly aware.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.340
All the time we are jumping on the cusp of thoughts

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:15.080
which come from the future or from the past. We cannot be in the present - it's impossible.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.900
But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates those thoughts

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.860
and creates a space in between, which in Sanskrit called as 'Vilamba' is the pause

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:33.120
and there it is you are thoughtlessly aware and that is the point where you grow spiritually,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.220
that is the point where you become a witness of the whole play

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.820
and also, that is the point where you become absolutely peaceful.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:50.580
You watch everything happening, you see everything going on but you are just watching it.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:57.740
Like when you are in the water, the water creates waves and you're afraid of the waves

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.780
but supposing you get on to a boat, you can see the same waves and enjoy

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:11.200
but supposing you learn how to swim, you can jump down and save many people. In the same stages you have to pass through.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:18.400
So the first one is where you become thoughtlessly aware and the second stage is

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.760
where you're doubtlessly aware - you have no doubts about yourself, about Divinity, about anything.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.040
But it happens to some people, both things together, somehow and

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.120
they achieve a state of complete peace within.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.960
They also emit peace, they also emit Divine vibrations

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.020
by which many problems can be solved, many

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.600
people who need peace, can achieve it.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:58.120
The another quality of Spirit is that when it is in attention, it enlightens your attention.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:05.420
By that enlightenment you can see things which normal you don't see, you feel which you never felt.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:11.180
It's very surprising that this attention is so

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:20.220
active, so meticulously working. If you pay attention to something, it works out.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:27.780
It works, this attention works and this is a kind of an attention you have which is potential

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:34.320
but once it becomes enlightened, it becomes such a dynamic force within yourself and

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:42.340
you pay attention to yourself and attention to others and amazingly you help people by your attention.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:50.580
The another greatest quality of Spirit is that it is the source of joy.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:59.060
Not that only it is the source of Absolute Truth but it's a source of joy.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:08.720
You work very hard, you do everything but you are a witness of the whole work. You don't think you're doing anything but you're just enjoying everything.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:17.480
You're enjoying your value system, you're enjoying your morality, you're uh.. enjoying your virtues.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:26.540
This joy is the source of doing everything effortlessly -

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:33.980
sahaja. It all works out, it works out so beautifully that amazingly

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.520
we find in a new world which we call the Kingdom of God.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:45.800
When I went to America, they had a problem of this school going on, so -

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.520
no I'm sorry, to Russia - and the Russians were least disturbed, who were sahaja yogies.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.420
I said, "Aren't you worried about this school which's going on?" He said, "Why should we, Mother?

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.820
We are in the Kingdom of God, why should we worry. We are not in the kingdom of Russia. "

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:09.420
Can you imagine, such a confidence! And we have thousands and thousands of Russians who have taken to sahaja yoga

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:16.960
because they're not conditioned. They're very clean people and they have understood what is Truth is.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:23.300
In the same way it's working out everywhere, no doubt but in the West I find people are very

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:29.040
conditioned about things and these conditionings sometimes stops them from achieving

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:35.820
Self- realization. Slowly, slowly they also start taking to it.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:42.600
First time we had two people from Australia who came to see Me in Bombay -

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.440
they got their realization, only two persons and today we have so many in Australia

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:56.880
because definitely they're very nice people, they want to be good, they want to achieve

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:02.180
something higher, they are all sincere about it and

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.320
we have to now think about our younger people

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:12.520
who are supposed to be mislaid by many wrong things.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:19.380
These also have come to sahaja yoga and have become quite alright, very normal, very beautiful people.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.040
We have no problems of younger people, even of smaller children.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:33.660
It's the times, I call it the blossom time, which is here and we should take full advantage of that.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:43.000
I'm sure all of you are going to get your realization. Only one thing you have to remember that you must have faith in yourself.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.440
Do not doubt yourself for anything whatsoever.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.340
As long as you don't doubt yourself, you'll get your Self-realization without any difficulty.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:36:00.880
May God bless you! Can we have some lights there also?

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:09.700
[ALL CLAP]

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.820
Can we have some lights at the back, I can't see them.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:46.140
Can't have lights underneath that? Can't have? You can have lights there - please, alright, it's good.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:02.820
Those who are standing, can you sit down or you can come here in this room to sit -
 it's better to sit down.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.020
It will hardly take ten minutes and

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.300
only thing is, I would request you, not to disturb others

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.760
by walking out or getting up at that time - hardly ten minutes.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:54.660
Of course you have questions, so you may write to Me and I will definitely try to answer them.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:02.880
I have been doing this work for the last 25 years now and I'm quite an expert in answering all kinds of

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.860
questions whether they are funny, stupid or anyway genuine.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:17.080
Ah..So, but it's an mental acrobat. There's nothing so great. It's only up to the mind - you have to go beyond the mind, so

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.980
it's better that we should forget about those questions just now, get your realization

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.040
and then I'll see how many have questions.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.500
Now

00:38:53.740 --> 00:39:01.600
of course there are some conditions, which are very simple conditions, which, I hope, you can follow.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.800
One of them,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.540
one of them is that you have to know at this moment

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:33.160
you are not guilty of anything. If you were, you would have been in jail.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.760
But when you are sitting here, please forgive yourself - very important.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:48.560
If you don't forgive yourself and you call yourself always guilty of something - I mean,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:55.240
the norms of life in the West is so funny that even if you put your spoon like this, then you feel guilty.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.400
It's nothing important.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:09.160
But if you feel guilty, then you catch on this center on the left-hand side, which we call as Left Vishudhdhi

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.160
and it's very dangerous because it causes

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:23.340
a very big damage. You might get Angina,

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:30.080
you might get spondylitis or you might get lethargic organs.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:38.240
So, what is the use of feeling guilty - it's not your job to feel guilty and carrying these

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:45.300
dangers with you. So, in all compassion and love of God, please forgive yourself

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:50.900
and know that you're not guilty at all. It's a fashion also to be guilty for anything.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:58.300
Like, I met one lady, she was guilty because in Afghanistan people were starving. I said, "Why're you feeling guilty?

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:05.160
If they're starving, send some money. What's the use of sitting down and feeling guilty?" It's a kind of a, you see,

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:10.960
a melodramatic uh.. attitude, I think, that people think, "Oh, I'm guilty, how can I?"

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:18.240
And to Me, some people told Me that, "You look so joyous, that's not good," in France once, first when I went there.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.780
"You shouldn't look so joyous." I said, "But I am, what can I do?" They said, "No,

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:32.200
here people are very miserable and you must say you're miserable." So, I said, "Why are they miserable here?"

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.900
So, I started My lecture with Les Miserable

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:44.700
and I said if every tenth lamp-post has got a pub and

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:50.700
about twelfth lamp-post there's a prostitute standing, what else will it be?

00:41:53.060 --> 00:42:00.440
You're inviting your own miseries and sitting outside on the street they were discussing when the world is going to end.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.540
That's the best - because now they're fed-up with themselves so they wanted to end the world also.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:13.440
So all this is more sort of a, mental attitude to feel guilty, "I should not have done that, I should not have done that."

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:17.740
So at this moment, I would request, don't feel guilty

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.540
because if this center is in jeopardy,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.220
this Kundalini won't rise, it cannot penetrate.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.940
So, you'll also miss such a nice opportunity.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:42.180
Then there is another problem is with the center on the optic chiasma

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.500
which we call as Agnya chakra.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:52.860
If you do not forgive people, it becomes like this. It's a very constricted center

00:42:54.220 --> 00:43:01.060
so you have to forgive others also. If you forgive others, then this center opens out like this

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.880
otherwise it's impossible.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:12.240
You cannot crossover this center, it's one of the most difficult ones, so please,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:19.060
just at this moment, forgive everyone in general. Don't even think about people

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:25.280
whom you have to forgive because it's a headache even to think of them. So just in general you forgive everyone,

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.880
just forgive everyone. You'll feel very happy and much lighter just now.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:38.580
These are the two conditions we have, the third one is easier, is to take out your shoes.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:47.100
When I said this in England, half of them walked out on the first day - they couldn't take out their shoes, so much attached to them.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:06.180
Because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. it helps us a lot to achieve

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:14.620
the, achieve our ascent. She sucks our problems.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:23.500
You don't know what this Mother Earth is. It's a very great blessing, specially in Australia, is a very great land.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:37.640
Now, in the beginning we'll tell you how we'll be nourishing our centers

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:45.440
which is very simple. This is only once you have to do tonight - you don't have to do it again, it's alright, very, very simple.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:53.720
Now after taking out your shoes, you please put both your feet apart from each other - that's all.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:03.280
Because as there are two powers within us, left and right, which are very different, so better keep them away from each other.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:15.820
The left power, which we call as the Left Sympathetic Nervous System, which is nourished by Ida Nadi

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:23.300
is for our desire, works out our desires which is, uh..

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.880
I should say, not a concrete thing, just you desire through this Nadi.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:35.900
So, you have to put your left hand, like this, on your lap - very comfortably you should sit down -

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:42.280
uh.. indicating that you're desirous of getting your Self-realization, that's all.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:50.600
Just put your left hand towards Me like this all the time. With the right hand is for your action.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:59.640
The right Nadi, which is Pingala Nadi, works out for your action. So you have to use your right hand

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:08.820
on different centers on the left-hand side - we work only on the left-hand side. So put your  right-hand on your heart, please.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:18.140
In the heart resides the Spirit. I've already told you about the Spirit.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.820
If you become the Spirit, you have the light of the Spirit

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:31.840
and you become your own guide, you become your own master, you become your own guru.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.140
So we take our right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.560
which is the center of your mastery.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.060
Then we take our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:02.440
Surprisingly, this is the center of pure knowledge of the Divine.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.020
Then we take our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen,

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.800
then on our heart again.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:27.620
Now, in the corner of your neck and your shoulder - I've already told you about this chakra - and turn your head to your right.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:35.720
I think, is really very caught up here -

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.540
please forgive yourself, please forgive yourself.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:49.660
Now, then we take our right hand on top of our forehead across like this and bend our head slowly.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:59.020
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:06.020
Then we take our right hand on the back side of our head and push back our head as far as possible.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:13.700
This is the center where, just for your satisfaction,

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:22.240
you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine power without feeling guilty, again.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.060
Now, you have to stretch your palm fully, like this

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.580
and put the center of your palm on top of your head

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:37.680
on to the fontanel bone, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:45.140
Now, please put down your head as far as possible. Push back your fingers as far as possible

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:54.240
and press it hard, your scalp, which you have to move clockwise, slowly, seven times.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.700
Push back your fingers - that's very important - push back your fingers so there's a better pressure.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:14.980
That's all you have to do. Bend your heads, please bend your heads, push back your fingers.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.140
That's all. This is all we have to do and now we have to close our eyes.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:32.300
Before closing our eyes, I would say, better take out your spectacles uh.. because it might help your eyesight also

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:40.480
and please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Don't press very hard just

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:47.440
ordinarily as we sleep, [UNCLEAR - YOU SEE IS?] very gentle way of closing the eyes.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:57.320
We have to have respect for ourselves and understanding that we are capable of achieving this higher state.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:03.240
So now please, put your left hand again towards Me, both the feet away from each other

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.020
and close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.280
[UNCLEAR] I think you can go now.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:29.280
Now, here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself to Me

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:35.380
in your heart, not loudly - nothing to be said aloudly. So please, ask a question -

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.920
you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you like -

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.520
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question, three times, in your heart.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.480
I've already told you that

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:07.620
if you become the Spirit, you become your own guide and your own master.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.560
So now, please take your hand the upper portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side and press it

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:19.220
and here you ask another fundamental question about yourself, three times, saying,

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.200
"Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:36.820
I must tell you I respect your freedom. If you don't want to have your realization, I cannot force you,

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:43.940
if you don't want to know about the pure knowledge of the Divine, I cannot force it on you - you have to ask for it.

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:52.220
So please, put your hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side and here you please ask

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.640
six times, because this center has got six petals,

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.660
"Mother, please let me know the

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.540
pure knowledge of the Divine." Please ask six times.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:31.400
As soon as you start asking this question, the Kundalini has started rising. It won't trouble you, it won't give you any shock.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:37.600
At the most some people might feel a little heat on their hands but it has started.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.340
So now, please raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:53.140
Now these are the upper centers which we have to open with our full self-confidence.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.620
Here you have to say ten times with full self-confidence,

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:05.720
"Mother, I am my own master." Please say this ten times,

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.980
"Mother, I am my own master," with full confidence.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:26.880
At the very outset I've told [UNCLEAR - ME?] that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions,

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:35.520
this intelligence, this ego or your conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:41.800
So now, please raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence,

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:48.520
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit." Please say it twelve times,

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.900
twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.360
I have already request you to forgive yourself because

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:25.120
this All-Pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of compassion and love

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.520
and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:37.860
and whatever mistakes you have committed, can be easily dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:45.380
So please forgive yourself, raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder please

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:54.260
and here press it hard. Put your head towards your right and here, please, you have to say

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.360
sixteen times,

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:06.340
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say it sixteen times - it's very important.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:27.640
I've already told you, that you have to forgive everyone, in general, not thinking about them

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:34.840
because if you don't forgive, this center of Agnya won't open out. As it is

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:41.960
whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything but if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:48.060
So at this moment, try to understand that as it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:55.960
but at this moment if you forgive, this center will open and you will achieve what you have to really achieve -

00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:03.760
your Self-realization. So please, forgive all the people in general.

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:10.100
Raise your right hand on top of your forehead and slowly put down your head

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.620
and here you have to say,

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.360
not how many times but from your heart

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:29.140
you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:37.460
in general." From your heart you have to say, not how many times.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:47.340
You have to now ask forgiveness from the Divine power

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:53.420
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:06.960
So now, take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head fully, push back.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:15.020
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:20.600
without counting your mistakes - from your heart, not how many times,

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.960
"Oh Divine power, if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me,"

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.540
from your heart you have to say, not counting.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:47.040
Now the last center is very important, is the most important so stretch your palm fully

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:57.760
Now, you have to put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:03.880
properly and now bend your head as far as possible.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:09.220
Stretch back your fingers, stretch back your fingers.

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:22.280
At this moment, I have to again say, that I cannot give you Self-realization unless and until you ask for it because

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.700
I respect your freedom. So here, you move your scalp slowly, ten times,

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:34.080
scalp by stretching your fingers out. Please put down your head, please put down your head.

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:41.700
And now move your scalp, ten times - I'm sorry, seven times.

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.440
Hmm.

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:56.260
Seven times, slowly, clockwise saying, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:03.360
Please move your scalp slowly, clockwise.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:13.060
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.620
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:24.800
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:31.120
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:41.300
Now take down your hand and please open your eyes slowly.

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.300
Put both the hands towards Me, like this, just like this

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:59.960
and put the right hand towards Me and bend your head

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:10.060
and see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.660
Hot or cold breeze might be coming, doesn't matter. It is hot means you have not forgiven

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.880
yourself or forgiven others so it's still hot.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:38.820
Again, take your left hand towards Me like this, put down your head and see with your right hand

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.520
if there's a cool or a hot breeze like

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:53.720
vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area. Please see with your right hand.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:08.600
Sometimes some people get it closer, sometimes they get it very far away, so you have to move your hand to see.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:15.480
If it is hot or cold doesn't matter but if you forgive just now yourself or others,

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:23.140
it will definitely will become better and cooler. Alright, now again once more.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.660
Put your left hand towards Me again and put your right hand

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.480
on top of your fontanel bone area and bend your head and now see yourself.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:46.560
Now, don't doubt yourself, that's the main point.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.360
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky like this

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.920
and ask a question. Put your head up and ask

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.580
one of the questions out of these three questions

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:07.440
three times. "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.180
Second, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of Divine love?"

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:21.220
Third one, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:33.660
It's alright - vibrations are coming from you to Me. Alright, put it down, please put it down.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:42.820
Now please put your hands like that. Now watch Me without thinking - you can do that - watch Me without thinking.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.940
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on the finger-tips or on the palms

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.760
or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.820
[UNCLEAR - DID OR DIDN'T?] feel it? Good.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.540
May God bless you! Most of you, surprisingly! Everyone of you.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:25.160
One or two haven't got it but we'll see them. May God bless you all!

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:33.460
Now you have to know what are these vibrations, what is this cool breeze which you have felt for the first time -

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:41.640
is the All-Pervading power of Divine love - and how to use it, how to work it out - that's what you have to do and grow into it.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:49.280
But I see when I come, I don't know, everywhere people somehow believe Me very much and they come to My programs

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:56.460
and afterwards they just disappear. Some of them, I don't know, they don't trust their own fellow-men who are realized souls here

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:03.600
who know so much about sahaja yoga. So please, do not waste this

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:11.300
awakening. Like Christ has said in His parable, that some seeds were sprouted

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:19.180

01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:03.680
they're not going to keep any secrets. Some people didn't feel it - doesn't matter. It can be worked out for them, all of them, maybe some reason

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:09.180
they haven't felt, so don't feel disappointed, there's nothing to be disappointed about

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:17.700
there is all worked out. Also the people who have problems can come and see those people in the center -

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:23.980
I'm sure, they will solve your problems, whether it is physical, mental, emotional, anything.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:31.180
