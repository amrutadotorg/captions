00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.298
All this being said on My birthday,

00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:32.050
really embarrasses Me,

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:37.008
because it's all being already

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.758
scheduled, it was all timed out.

00:01:43.298 --> 00:01:45.716
It had to happen this way.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:49.925
And the time has come now that

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:59.133
this whole world has to take to global understanding.

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:04.258
Human beings, I was surprised,

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:09.298
are how anxious in those difficult times

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:13.674
to get to the truth; because very difficult

00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:18.633
to carry on with the truth, when there's untruth all along.

00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:23.298
And the way people get after you when you talk of truth,

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:28.841
is also a very hazardous task to fight them

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.591
those who are just always

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:38.217
going to cruelties,

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:42.298
to untruth, to aggressiveness.

00:02:43.382 --> 00:02:46.800
These are all self destructive elements.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:51.298
Also we have other self destructive elements within us,

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:55.716
like drinking, smoking,

00:02:56.382 --> 00:03:02.175
we can say also other things, like drug taking. But people do it.

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.217
Just they do it. Not that they don't know,

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.175
but they just do it because of the influence of the time.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.298
And that is what is the Kali Yuga,

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:19.925
where we destroy ourselves and try to destroy others,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:25.382
and have a kind of a funny temptation for this

00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:29.298
not only that, also we enjoy all these.

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:35.466
All this cruelty, all this aggression we enjoy.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.508
Now when do we say that the Kali Yuga is over, we should know

00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:43.841
something about Kali Yuga.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:49.258
Kali was one of the deities,

00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:54.382
who was supposed to bring in Kali Yuga,

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:57.091
and all the problems of Kali Yuga.

00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.298
Firstly it creates illusions, "bhranti".

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:06.008
It creates illusions. People will not understand

00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:09.298
who is a real person, who is an unreal person.

00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:13.298
So we have many false gurus as you know.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.716
We have many false propagandists.

00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:19.508
We have many people who talk big

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:22.008
but there's nothing in them.

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:27.175
This is one type of a "bhranti" that Kali Yuga creates.

00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:32.298
Once it so happened, that Nala and Damayanti too

00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:36.424
were in love with each other. They were husband and wife.

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:40.674
And Damayanti was separated from Nala,

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:46.091
by this horrible thing called Kali.

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:52.299
This Kali fellow has being doing this kind of work,

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.466
used to create problems in the minds of people,

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:59.758
disturbing families, disturbing nations, disturbing

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:04.591
all the good wishes and the good feelings among human beings.

00:05:05.508 --> 00:05:11.508
So once this gentleman, one we call Kali was caught up,

00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:16.758
by Nala, Nala, the one who hated him.

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:21.758
And Nala said that, "Why don't you allow me to kill you?

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:25.883
You should be killed because you are such a horrible person,

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:30.549
you create such bhranti, you create such problems for people.

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:35.175
He said, "If you want to kill me, you can kill me

00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:38.883
but first listen to my importance, to my mahatmya.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:42.217
"What is your mahatmaya? What is your importance?"

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:46.424
He said, "My importance is, that when I'll come on this earth,

00:05:47.008 --> 00:05:50.549
when I'll rule on this earth, I know there will be bhranti,

00:05:50.758 --> 00:05:53.758
there will be chaos, there will be problems,

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:57.591
but people will be so much fed up with that,

00:05:57.966 --> 00:06:00.716
that they will seek the truth.

00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:05.382
And those people today who are going to the hills and dales

00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:09.050
to find out the truth, will be there

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:14.091
as ordinary human beings, as householders.

00:06:14.298 --> 00:06:17.298
And they will find the truth,

00:06:18.424 --> 00:06:20.341
definitely they'll find the truth.

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:24.175
It has been already predicted by Kali himself.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.674
So as you see lots of chaos is there, lots of problems are there,

00:06:29.883 --> 00:06:32.883
and when you see people you can't understand,

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:37.217
how such people who are educated, intelligent,

00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:39.883
supposed to be at the helm of affairs,

00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:43.549
can go about with wrong ideas, with wrong things.

00:06:44.298 --> 00:06:46.800
The problem is this Kali Yuga.

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:52.341
This creates this funny situation, in our lives.

00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:58.050
Firstly it creates a situation where a person starts thinking,

00:06:58.298 --> 00:07:02.175
he's very insecure and he must take to some way,

00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:04.925
of protecting himself.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.508
And then where he goes to, is the place where he will be destroyed,

00:07:11.883 --> 00:07:15.008
before he knows even that he'll be destroyed.

00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.217
The second point is that we have

00:07:19.591 --> 00:07:23.466
a great sense of jealousy.

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:30.298
That sense of jealousy is even more heighten by this Kali Yuga.

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.091
We feel jealous for everything,

00:07:34.424 --> 00:07:38.508
which it shows our inferiority complex, or I don't know what it is?

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.674
But we start feeling jealous and out of jealousy we start

00:07:42.883 --> 00:07:45.466
hating people without any rhyme and reason.

00:07:45.883 --> 00:07:48.091
So many countries have this problem.

00:07:48.424 --> 00:07:53.299
It's at the top, politicians,

00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:57.508
they indulge into this kind of a hatred for other people,

00:07:57.883 --> 00:08:01.883
without understanding what is the

00:08:02.674 --> 00:08:05.925
achievement of the other person is, how he has achieved,

00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:08.758
and "Why should I be jealous?"

00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:14.841
Then we have, another thing is apart from that is,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.008
which is the worst thing as Krishna has said, is the temper.

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:24.508
Hot tempered people, you see, cannot see the truth,

00:08:25.258 --> 00:08:28.716
because at the slightest provocation

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:33.091
they become hot-tempered and start hitting others

00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:36.633
and beating others or saying horrible things

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:41.258
which should not be said. Now, this is another

00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:46.008
criteria for every Sahaja Yogi to know,

00:08:46.298 --> 00:08:53.716
how far he is out of this sense of "krodha", is the anger.

00:08:56.217 --> 00:09:00.050
To be angry it shows that you have

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:06.466
no peace within and that you get angry for

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:11.091
just to attack another person, which is not necessary.

00:09:11.466 --> 00:09:16.382
Even keeping quiet you can be very much effective.

00:09:18.008 --> 00:09:21.341
There's a story about Chinese people that

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.050
in China there was a fight going on between

00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:31.382
some people, and they said, "Let's have the cocks fight for us".

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.133
So they had a cock fight.

00:09:34.298 --> 00:09:39.008
So one fellow took a cock to a Zen fellow and he said that

00:09:39.298 --> 00:09:43.258
"What, what should I do, if this cock has to fight?"

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.008
And he said that, "Very simple,

00:09:48.298 --> 00:09:51.008
you teach the cock to be absolutely quiet."

00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:54.133
He said, "I can't do that." He said, "All right, give me the cock."

00:09:54.298 --> 00:09:57.925
And he taught the cock how to be quiet,

00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:01.217
whatever is happening, whosoever is attacking him.

00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:06.633
When he went into the arena, many cocks started attacking him,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.258
and he was just standing quietly, watching at everyone.

00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:14.841
This settled the thing because everybody ran away and they thought

00:10:15.008 --> 00:10:17.591
he is such a powerful thing, he's not saying anything. So not

00:10:21.382 --> 00:10:25.382
attacking not reacting that we achieve anything.

00:10:26.175 --> 00:10:30.424
Actually reaction is a very great enemy of human beings,

00:10:30.716 --> 00:10:32.758
that we react to everything.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.466
We should not react, we should just become silent.

00:10:36.758 --> 00:10:40.091
And then this power, which I tell you about,

00:10:40.298 --> 00:10:44.341
is the power of Paramchaitanya, acts.

00:10:44.633 --> 00:10:47.841
If you want to react, all right. It says, "Go ahead".

00:10:48.175 --> 00:10:52.841
But if you leave it and you just become quiet,

00:10:53.217 --> 00:10:57.674
silent, it acts. It acts so well.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.591
It can act sitting down here, it can act somewhere else.

00:11:02.716 --> 00:11:08.091
It is such a tremendous power. It is such an effective power.

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:12.008
It is such an understanding, knowledgeable power,

00:11:12.217 --> 00:11:16.091
and above all it loves, it loves you.

00:11:16.674 --> 00:11:21.091
So when this power comes into existence in a way,

00:11:21.298 --> 00:11:23.549
I would say it has been always existing,

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.633
but when effective, in the Krita Yuga it is effective,

00:11:28.424 --> 00:11:32.466
by that you'll be amazed how things happen.

00:11:32.633 --> 00:11:35.800
Everybody tells Me, "Mother this miracle has taken place,

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:38.133
that miracle has taken place. "

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:41.341
So, I know it's not miracle. It is Paramchaitanya,

00:11:41.549 --> 00:11:44.925
which is doing all the work, all the beautiful things,

00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:49.091
which is trying to help you and trying to suggest its love.

00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:54.091
You see, it is something we can't see

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.966
something we cannot conceive with this mind.

00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:02.050
But it is beyond the mind that it works.

00:12:02.298 --> 00:12:06.633
I was surprised in Russia specially, I had to face the scientists.

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:12.217
Then the scientists were so, so much equipped, so much deep and

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:16.298
they understood so well, even in a place,

00:12:20.716 --> 00:12:24.133
you can call it a place of great learning,

00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:28.091
one of the oldest universities, St. Petersburg University.

00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:32.883
There also I don't know, what made they gave Me

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.008
the highest reward. For what? I didn't know.

00:12:38.298 --> 00:12:41.549
But they said, "You are even higher than science."

00:12:41.925 --> 00:12:44.508
So this they called as cognitive science.

00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:47.050
They gave a name as cognitive science.

00:12:47.298 --> 00:12:50.591
"So Mother Your whole knowledge is of cognitive science."

00:12:51.091 --> 00:12:55.674
Only thing is, if I tell you something then you can verify it.

00:12:56.133 --> 00:12:58.716
The scientists can verify it.

00:12:58.883 --> 00:13:02.674
Everybody can find it out if it so or not.

00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:06.883
But if you put this test to all these false gurus,

00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:11.175
you will see that they, they don't have any scientific basis.

00:13:12.549 --> 00:13:16.424
They have no way of giving you any explanation,

00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:20.091
as to why this is happening and what is happening?

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.091
I had to face all of them all over the world.

00:13:24.298 --> 00:13:26.966
And I was surprised they recognized Me.

00:13:27.298 --> 00:13:31.633
And they said, "Mother this is cognitive science" and like that,

00:13:31.883 --> 00:13:35.341
they gave Me, everywhere they gave Me awards and things like that.

00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:38.633
I never knew what is cognitive science is.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.716
But this is the knowledge that you get beyond your mind.

00:13:43.298 --> 00:13:45.633
With your mind you get is your

00:13:45.966 --> 00:13:50.508
biased, maybe full of jealousy, maybe full of anger.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.298
But beyond the mind even you get this knowledge that is absolute.

00:13:56.175 --> 00:13:59.091
Nobody can challenge it, absolute knowledge.

00:13:59.633 --> 00:14:04.424
For example, I'll tell you one thing and if you see this model

00:14:05.382 --> 00:14:07.591
from the right side to the left side,

00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:10.008
there it will look like a swastika.

00:14:10.424 --> 00:14:13.050
I made a model for them, to show them.

00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:16.633
And if you see it from the left side on the right side

00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:19.008
it will be "aum" written down.

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:21.883
And if you see from down upward,

00:14:22.298 --> 00:14:26.591
it is a cross, that means,

00:14:27.508 --> 00:14:32.800
Shri Ganesha, who is on Mooladhara, incarnates as Christ.

00:14:34.175 --> 00:14:36.591
So they made a picture, they made a model,

00:14:37.298 --> 00:14:39.758
the scientists, and they found out

00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:43.716
that what I said is true and this model

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:47.925
really can be shown. I mean one of them is like this,

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:51.633
that whatever you know, whatever you say,

00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:55.758
should be verified by even scientists.

00:14:56.591 --> 00:14:58.716
I do not discard science.

00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.966
Science is amoral, whatever you may say.

00:15:02.258 --> 00:15:05.549
But once they come to Sahaja Yoga, these scientists,

00:15:05.758 --> 00:15:07.841
they just get transformed.

00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:11.758
But scientists, in other countries, I don't know about our country,

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.549
in other countries have reached such a state, such a state,

00:15:16.925 --> 00:15:20.716
that they want to know what is beyond.

00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:24.298
All of them come to India, why? Why don't they go to Japan?

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:28.758
Why don't they go to China, why don't they go to America?

00:15:28.925 --> 00:15:31.716
To find the truth they come to India.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.549
So in India this cognitive science existed long time back,

00:15:36.758 --> 00:15:39.633
of which we are not aware.

00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:44.298
Like I must say, Indians suddenly became very westernized,

00:15:44.508 --> 00:15:48.674
after independence somehow, all Gandhiji's ideas,

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:51.674
and everything was put on the shelves.

00:15:51.883 --> 00:15:55.424
So, we, we didn't know what was so great in our country.

00:15:55.758 --> 00:16:00.800
Such a great "sampada", such a great power

00:16:00.966 --> 00:16:05.800
existed in this country and they knew so many things,

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:11.674
so many things about, some things that science do not know.

00:16:12.382 --> 00:16:15.258
Now it is for science to find out,

00:16:15.382 --> 00:16:17.925
whatever they have said it's true or not.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.633
I have seen this, it's very simple,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.674
if you really know the truth and you tell a scientist

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.175
he'll get after it and he'll work it out.

00:16:27.925 --> 00:16:31.341
It's not one example, there can be hundreds I can give you,

00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:33.800
where I've told them something. They said, " All right."

00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:37.298
"You verify, you find out, by your scientific methods."

00:16:38.382 --> 00:16:42.758
And they found it, they found it. There's so many ways

00:16:43.091 --> 00:16:46.508
of finding it out, you have in science.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.133
But they don't know what to find.

00:16:49.382 --> 00:16:52.050
They are just going on in this one, that one.

00:16:52.217 --> 00:16:54.716
They are going to the moon, they are going to this thing.

00:16:54.883 --> 00:16:58.800
That's not the way. First you find out what you have to find

00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:02.091
and then see if it is there or not.

00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:05.591
I was surprised in the West, though we call them

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:09.091
very much sort of advanced and all these things,

00:17:09.298 --> 00:17:12.966
but as far as spirituality is concerned they are nowhere.

00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:18.341
Their cognitive science faculty is very poor compared to us.

00:17:18.883 --> 00:17:23.966
But our also is zero because we have all become westernised now.

00:17:24.508 --> 00:17:26.966
All our ideas are westernised

00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:29.549
and we take all the knowledge from outside.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.674
And even those who want to do something

00:17:33.298 --> 00:17:37.966
about Indian culture and all that, they are so small,

00:17:38.298 --> 00:17:42.633
they are so incapable of

00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:46.716
telling them what it is. It has nothing to do

00:17:46.883 --> 00:17:50.382
with a fundamentalist idea, nothing of the kind.

00:17:50.633 --> 00:17:54.758
But it is a fact, it's the truth. it's the reality,

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.217
which they don't know themselves. They just want to proclaim,

00:17:58.424 --> 00:18:02.591
the Bhartiya Sanskriti, Indian culture,

00:18:02.758 --> 00:18:04.633
but there is nothing like that.

00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:08.133
Because unless and until you are a realized soul

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.508
and you have reached that state,

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.298
till then you do not know anything

00:18:15.424 --> 00:18:18.091
about the mysteries of Paramchaitanya.

00:18:18.758 --> 00:18:23.382
So for every Indian it is very important to take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:24.716 --> 00:18:27.758
Also for all the people all over the world.

00:18:27.925 --> 00:18:31.299
Everywhere as she told you about Russia, the condition is very bad,

00:18:31.758 --> 00:18:37.091
but still I must say the Sahaja Yogis are very much happy there.

00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:41.674
The way, when I was there once there was this coup was on,

00:18:42.298 --> 00:18:44.466
and everybody was worried and we saw lots of

00:18:44.883 --> 00:18:46.466
tankers passing, this thing and all.

00:18:46.883 --> 00:18:50.091
So I asked these Russian Sahaja Yogis,

00:18:50.298 --> 00:18:54.382
they are more than I think one lakh,

00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:57.050
much more than one lakh, I don't know how many they are.

00:18:57.217 --> 00:18:59.591
So I asked them, "Aren't you worried,

00:18:59.883 --> 00:19:01.758
what is happening in your country?"

00:19:01.883 --> 00:19:04.091
He said, "Mother we are not". I said, "Why?"

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:06.549
"Because we are in the kingdom of God,

00:19:06.716 --> 00:19:09.050
why should we worry about Russia?"

00:19:10.424 --> 00:19:13.716
You see, this also is a temperament that changes.

00:19:13.883 --> 00:19:15.883
and a person doesn't tell lies,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.966
but he really feels that way and that's how

00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:22.800
he gets rid of all these nonsensical ideas

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.716
of religion, cast, nation, this, that.

00:19:28.716 --> 00:19:31.633
It separates human beings from human beings.

00:19:32.591 --> 00:19:35.633
But artificially you cannot join them.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:39.091
Many people start talking, "No, no, we should not have

00:19:39.298 --> 00:19:42.091
all these different things, we should have one."

00:19:42.508 --> 00:19:44.508
You can't, you can't have.

00:19:45.758 --> 00:19:49.466
Because temperamentally human beings are not made like that,

00:19:50.883 --> 00:19:54.591
You see, we had a little discussion there in Italy,

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.091
with other religious groups,

00:19:57.298 --> 00:20:00.966
and they said, "We, we don't want one religion,

00:20:01.258 --> 00:20:03.298
one global religion, we don't want."

00:20:03.508 --> 00:20:06.549
I said, "Why? Because you want to fight, that's why?

00:20:06.758 --> 00:20:09.217
Why you don't want one religion?

00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:12.341
One religion is that you are a human being,

00:20:12.591 --> 00:20:15.466
and you are a wonderful human being,

00:20:15.758 --> 00:20:18.424
and that you can be one with the Divine.

00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:24.133
This is your religion which is promised and has to work out.

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:28.091
And, but they wouldn't accept. But the people are changing.

00:20:28.925 --> 00:20:31.966
They are transforming themselves so fast

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:34.549
that I am surprised in a country like Turkey,

00:20:34.716 --> 00:20:37.217
we have two thousands Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:38.925 --> 00:20:43.091
And they are converting so many. So all these funny ideas that,

00:20:43.298 --> 00:20:46.424
all these priests, mulaahs and all those have created,

00:20:47.298 --> 00:20:52.050
are going down. And what is coming up?  Even we have lots of these

00:20:52.758 --> 00:20:56.841
people in India, panditas, and shastras and this and that,

00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.633
they don't know anything I would say, because unless and until

00:21:01.133 --> 00:21:05.758
they feel the Paramchaitanya, their all talking is baseless.

00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:11.758
So all these problems which are created by fighting,

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.633
by aggressiveness, showing off or whatever you may call,

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.133
can be corrected with Sahaja Yoga

00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:21.633
because your attention goes beyond the mind.

00:21:23.258 --> 00:21:25.133
You go beyond the mind.

00:21:25.298 --> 00:21:28.674
This Agnya chakra opens and you go beyond the mind

00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:31.133
and then you are one with this divine power.

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:33.758
Once you are one with the divine power,

00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:38.466
how it works for you in small, small ways.

00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:40.466
I mean you all have experience,

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:42.716
you are all Sahaja Yogis so I need not tell you,

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:48.008
but everyone can tell so many examples, by which

00:21:48.466 --> 00:21:51.966
he knows that it's the Paramchaitanya which has worked it.

00:21:52.758 --> 00:21:57.341
So first and foremost thing of every seeker of truth

00:21:57.591 --> 00:22:01.674
who is a real person, is to first get Self-Realization.

00:22:02.175 --> 00:22:05.925
That is the essence of spirituality, all over the world,

00:22:06.175 --> 00:22:08.716
even if you read Bible, if you read Koran.

00:22:08.883 --> 00:22:12.008
Nobody has read them that's the best part of it.

00:22:12.217 --> 00:22:16.008
And they are trying to say things which are very shameful.

00:22:16.716 --> 00:22:19.966
which are not there and they are fighting for that.

00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:24.091
With all these things they have helped us very much to show,

00:22:24.298 --> 00:22:29.508
that the essence of all these religions is one and out of that will

00:22:30.258 --> 00:22:34.883
one day people will take to Self Realization.

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:40.424
Once they take to Self Realization, then they have to grow.

00:22:40.591 --> 00:22:43.341
Once they have grown into it, they can see.

00:22:43.508 --> 00:22:46.466
All of you know, you are all Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

00:22:46.674 --> 00:22:50.298
you know how much you have gained and how much you have achieved.

00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:53.800
So to give Me the credit, I don't know,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.758
it's not really true, because,

00:23:01.716 --> 00:23:04.091
we had great saints in some countries,

00:23:04.674 --> 00:23:07.382
great saints in this country, in every country,

00:23:07.716 --> 00:23:10.549
you know we had sufis in so many countries.

00:23:10.716 --> 00:23:15.091
They all have tried to say, that take your Self Realization.

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:17.633
"Know thy Self."

00:23:17.966 --> 00:23:21.050
They all have said the same thing, "Know thy Self".

00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:24.298
But nobody is doing that, that's a different point.

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:28.466
But actually all those who were Realized souls, whether they were

00:23:28.716 --> 00:23:32.591
from a Muslim religion or a Hindu religion or a Christian religion,

00:23:32.883 --> 00:23:37.382
any religion in any country if they were Realized souls,

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.175
they said the same. Because truth is the same.

00:23:41.883 --> 00:23:45.633
They said the same thing, "First know thy Self"

00:23:46.298 --> 00:23:48.549
and then you will know the truth.

00:23:48.841 --> 00:23:52.883
So this is the essence of our life

00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:55.925
that we have to know ourselves.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:00.925
Once we know ourselves, you are beyond everything, because

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:07.841
what happens that you become like an ocean becomes in this,

00:24:09.341 --> 00:24:11.883
like a drop becomes in the ocean.

00:24:12.091 --> 00:24:16.008
How it disappears... In the same thing it will happen.

00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:19.591
And once it happens, you'll be surprised,

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.716
that you are really one with everyone. Who is the other?

00:24:26.258 --> 00:24:29.883
You are one with everyone, that's how we find in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:30.091 --> 00:24:33.758
It's a, many people say, it's a big charisma

00:24:33.883 --> 00:24:36.424
it's big this thing. Nothing of the kind.

00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:39.382
You have your own Kundalini,

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:43.758
you have own possibility, of becoming Self Realizing.

00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:47.716
Now, that is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:24:48.175 --> 00:24:50.298
In the Kali Yuga, this was going to happen

00:24:50.341 --> 00:24:52.008
and that's what it is happening.

00:24:52.175 --> 00:24:54.883
That's why thousands of you are getting Realization.

00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:57.591
Before, only one would get from one person,

00:24:57.758 --> 00:25:00.424
and those gurus were also very strict, you know, they

00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:03.298
would not give it to some ordinary person.

00:25:03.424 --> 00:25:08.258
They used to take them to task and judge them first.

00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:10.008
And then they would give Realization.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.758
But in Sahaja Yoga we don't do anything.

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:16.133
You just have to get into Sahaja Yoga, that's all.

00:25:16.508 --> 00:25:19.424
Now, as it is, I'm surprised that

00:25:19.633 --> 00:25:23.549
how intellectuals and this and that try to find faults,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.841
without knowing that they don't know anything.

00:25:27.758 --> 00:25:30.633
They have to become Self-Realized people.

00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:34.758
Then, whatever they will do, that will be,

00:25:34.925 --> 00:25:38.298
definitely very constructive, very helpful,

00:25:38.758 --> 00:25:41.716
and peace giving, and harmony giving to the whole society.

00:25:42.633 --> 00:25:45.091
But first of all it has to be within you.

00:25:45.298 --> 00:25:48.298
If it is not within you, how can you give it to others.

00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:53.091
I've been watching how Sahaja Yoga has grown from one person

00:25:53.298 --> 00:25:54.966
to all these, so many of them.

00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:58.008
And we have so many others, in other countries also.

00:25:58.549 --> 00:26:02.966
This all has shown that the time has come

00:26:03.175 --> 00:26:05.549
for the whole world to change.

00:26:05.758 --> 00:26:10.758
And this transformation is the most important thing,

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:13.341
what we should aim at.

00:26:13.508 --> 00:26:16.424
Forget about everything. Forget about politics, economics,

00:26:16.633 --> 00:26:20.008
this, that, but get transformation.

00:26:20.298 --> 00:26:24.424
Once you are transformed, you know how to do the right thing,

00:26:26.133 --> 00:26:28.298
how to do the things

00:26:28.424 --> 00:26:31.091
that will help you and the society.

00:26:31.883 --> 00:26:34.925
All these you already have seen in your life,

00:26:35.298 --> 00:26:40.008
and whatever is happened, is none of My only effort

00:26:40.217 --> 00:26:43.091
but there have been so many who have been doing this.

00:26:43.298 --> 00:26:47.341
Only if you can say anything is Me, is that I found out

00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:51.050
a way by which en masse Realization can be given.

00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:54.633
Many people can get it. Because any discovery,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.050
supposing there's electricity and if it cannot be used

00:26:58.298 --> 00:27:00.258
en masse, it is useless.

00:27:00.341 --> 00:27:04.591
So that's the only thing I've been able to achieve in My life,

00:27:04.758 --> 00:27:07.966
that en masse Realization can be given.

00:27:08.298 --> 00:27:12.341
And that has happen, as you know very well. It's very simple.

00:27:12.508 --> 00:27:15.758
And once one person gets Realization,

00:27:15.883 --> 00:27:18.008
he can go and give Realization to others.

00:27:18.175 --> 00:27:19.674
Now first, they were telling Me,

00:27:19.841 --> 00:27:22.633
"Mother, we are in seventy countries working".

00:27:22.883 --> 00:27:26.091
Now they are telling Me, "We are in eighty countries". How?

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:28.841
Somebody went there and he did in that country,

00:27:29.008 --> 00:27:31.175
he went there, he did in other country.

00:27:31.298 --> 00:27:34.883
So, just imagine how simple it has become.

00:27:35.298 --> 00:27:38.758
How simple it is for Me. At this age I can't go

00:27:39.008 --> 00:27:41.091
to seventy, eighty countries,

00:27:41.298 --> 00:27:43.841
but it has passed there, it has gone there.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.133
It has given the blessings of the Divine.

00:27:48.382 --> 00:27:50.674
So, while you are here,

00:27:50.883 --> 00:27:54.382
you should know here only we had Nizzamuddin Aulia.

00:27:54.508 --> 00:27:58.091
Now Nizzamuddin was here and here we had Damdam Sahib.

00:27:58.298 --> 00:28:00.883
All these were great saints.

00:28:01.883 --> 00:28:05.091
And they talked of love, they talked of understanding,

00:28:05.298 --> 00:28:08.633
but talk becomes talk for them because the others who are listening,

00:28:09.008 --> 00:28:11.341
have no understanding about.

00:28:12.466 --> 00:28:17.466
So we are recipients of their blessings, their beauties

00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:22.050
and their greatness, is only when we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:24.758
or we are Realized souls.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.299
So I bless you all with whole My heart and with whole My soul

00:28:28.883 --> 00:28:35.091
and I have been trying to work out in a way,

00:28:35.298 --> 00:28:38.716
that I was surprised, in America, it is spreading so fast,

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.091
otherwise all the false gurus have been to America.

00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:47.050
But now it is something great that is happening, suddenly,

00:28:47.298 --> 00:28:50.091
so, I told them I'll come and stay in America,

00:28:50.298 --> 00:28:55.633
for about two two months at least, for their satisfaction.

00:28:55.966 --> 00:28:58.674
Now, staying anywhere is not so important.

00:28:59.008 --> 00:29:04.716
What is important is that people should understand,

00:29:06.258 --> 00:29:08.466
they should humble down

00:29:08.674 --> 00:29:11.508
and they should know, "No, we still we have to know the truth".

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:15.674
If once this humility comes in, it will work out.

00:29:16.175 --> 00:29:18.758
It will work out in any person,

00:29:19.298 --> 00:29:23.091
anyone, whatever may be the cast, religion,

00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:25.674
race, makes no difference.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.133
So may God bless you again and again, and I bless you from My heart.

00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:34.716
Thank you very much for this felicitation. Thank you.
