00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:15.888
It is your special quality now that you
can really get rid of your fear completely.

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:19.292
What is there to be afraid of wife or afraid of husband?

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:21.257
What can he do to you?

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:27.656
At the most he’ll kill you, so
what, you are going to die anyway!

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.535
So the fear of death is another nonsense people have.

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:40.725
First time when I started My work
everywhere they asked Me, "What about death?"

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:44.935
I said, but just now you are living;
why are you asking, "What about death?"

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:48.389
So many people ask Me question, "What about our death";

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.235
with why do you want to know about it?

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.201
I'll tell you what about today, just now.

00:00:53.546 --> 00:01:01.321
So this is another mad idea - that we should
know about our death, what's going to happen,

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:02.885
and whatever happens.

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:04.709
Once you are dead you are finished.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.809
You don't have to do anything after that.

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:12.619
So what's the use of knowing when,
when you will die, what will happen to you?

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:14.794
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:18.159
We never ask, that when I sleep
what will happen to me, do we?

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:23.804
And this is a permanent sleep and we worry
so much about it that we should know what

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.934
will happen after death.

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:31.807
One has to die at the time whenever it has
to die, because whatever is born has to be

00:01:31.887 --> 00:01:33.033
dead.

00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:41.622
But you do know that you have got eternal life.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:44.242
You can never die.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:56.760
Death is not this body disappearing; death is
where you are absolutely without any control

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.838
of your soul live.

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:09.174
Once you are a realized soul you have
all the control, all the powers: to take your

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:14.839
soul wherever you feel like, to be born if
you like; if you don't want you will not be

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:23.474
born, to be born with the people in the
families, in the communities wherever you like.

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:30.199
There are many great souls I know that
have taken birth daringly into societies which

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:38.114
are very much, I should say, deteriorating
and are in danger of getting destroyed because

00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:40.595
of stupidity they do.

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:55.495
So this happening, that we are afraid of
death, is absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.537
What is there to think even about your death?

00:02:59.617 --> 00:03:06.882
There is nothing like death for you
because you have got eternal life.

00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:11.017
It's not that you continue with the same body.

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:17.327
You may go on changing your dress but you
are living, you are aware, and you know even

00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:24.639
if this body is not there-you will be there;
all the time, available for Sahaja Yoga, for

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:30.269
anything that is to be done in the name of reality.

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:43.700
So you must know your position as eternal
being what is your work, what is your idea,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.392
what you have to do.

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:54.448
So one has to get rid of this idea of
death because death doesn't exist for you.

00:03:54.528 --> 00:03:55.999
It's finished.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:03.854
Moreover, all such people who are afraid
of their death go on having insurances, this,

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:09.488
that, all headaches, see, and ultimately what happens?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.880
All these worldly things you leave here and you depart.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:25.857
There is I don't think anybody could
carry even a little dust with that soul

00:04:25.937 --> 00:04:27.515
which is departing.

00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:33.921
But in your case, when you people
are no more on this earth so called,

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:39.482
then you don't carry all this material
things because you have already given up.

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:41.654
You have no interest in them.

00:04:41.734 --> 00:04:51.779
You're not materialistic so your spirit is
free, and when you die what happens to you

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:58.139
is a very simple thing - that you
feel very liberated, absolutely.

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:07.163
And then you feel your freedom completely,
and you can decide what you want to do.

00:05:07.243 --> 00:05:14.162
It's all under your own guidance,
your own desire; everything works out.

00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:21.595
You don't feel that you have come out of
your body, and this is what should tell you that

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:29.488
there should be no fear of death, but
on the contrary - it should be welcomed.

00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:37.443
Because you will feel much
more liberated, much more at ease.

00:05:37.523 --> 00:05:43.534
You don't have other problems that you have
to in any case carry on in this world so because

00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:44.689
of this body.

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:50.909
Now see I have to take some medicines, I
have to take vitamins; don't have to take anything,

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:52.528
don't need it.

00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:55.933
This body's finished is a very good idea.

00:05:58.182 --> 00:06:01.489
They're so troublesome it is you see.

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.461
All the time despite the fact that you
may say that, "Oh I don't care for this body,"

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.648
and all that, but this body won't leave you.

00:06:08.728 --> 00:06:13.845
This is the most sticky thing we have is our body.

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:23.773
So to forget about death should
be the easiest thing for you.

00:06:23.853 --> 00:06:31.490
What gives me the greatest enjoyment is to
see how you love each other, care for each

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.826
other, joke with each other and dance with each other.

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:39.167
This is the greatest thing that I enjoy.

00:06:39.247 --> 00:06:43.322
I don't want to get rid of this idea of Mine.

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:50.833
Despite the fact, so many times I find it's hard to
believe how could Sahaja Yogis behave like this,

00:06:50.913 --> 00:07:01.501
and try to create rifts, and distances
between the people who are realized souls.

00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:09.166
Because realized souls anywhere in the world,
you should see them, they respect each other.

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:15.945
Not only respect, cared and never
talked ill of another realized soul.

00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:17.025
Never.

00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:30.814
My only blessings to you is that you grow
in it and grow in it and become greater and

00:07:30.894 --> 00:07:35.200
greater people; never thinking
that you are better than others;

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.502
never thinking that you are special than others.

00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:43.000
This will definitely soothe you down completely.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.069
Somebody might have hurt you somewhere, doesn't matter.

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:49.116
Somebody must have scolded you, doesn't matter.

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:56.408
What is your capacity is to - love another
person, and to be affectionate and kind.

00:07:58.663 --> 00:08:05.213
I'm really amazed how these 25
years have passed with all kinds of

00:08:05.293 --> 00:08:10.444
stupid problems, and nice things and - such a mixture.

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:17.187
And all those things have never
disturbed Me; I was never disturbed.

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:22.602
I used to act sometimes that I am
angry, or sometimes I used to say

00:08:22.682 --> 00:08:28.412
things which I should not have normally
said, because it was needed to be said.

00:08:28.492 --> 00:08:41.101
But, on the whole, like sitting in a very
big ship you can say, we all are elevated

00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:45.222
into the realm of Divine Love.

00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:48.346
And this is what one has to enjoy.

00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:52.419
One person if he has that love and compassion,

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:59.089
and that pure love, then that person can emit it to others,

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:04.809
and the record of this compassion is extremely

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:07.630
beautiful, which cannot be described in words.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.495
Like yesterday I couldn't speak.

00:09:10.575 --> 00:09:14.762
In what words I could put My feelings?

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:24.387
I thought there are no words yet created
on this earth to express My deep feeling

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:32.069
that how you people have taken Sahaja
Yoga so well and have understood it.

00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:33.757
May God bless you all.
