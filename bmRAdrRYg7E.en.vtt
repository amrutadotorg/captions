00:28:46.504 --> 00:28:51.819
I believe you all say these things,

00:28:56.182 --> 00:28:58.182
and you listen to it,

00:29:08.173 --> 00:29:10.173
and you say it from your heart.

00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:19.577
Only the one who are united with God can worship Shri Ganesha.

00:29:23.824 --> 00:29:25.824
And Shri Ganesha worships your Mother.

00:29:40.414 --> 00:29:42.414
First of all

00:29:44.325 --> 00:29:46.325
one must to understand

00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:51.938
that there is a combination of a Mother and a Guru.

00:29:55.388 --> 00:29:57.388
Because Guru is a very hard task master.

00:30:00.164 --> 00:30:02.164
He does not allow any liberties to be taken.

00:30:05.229 --> 00:30:07.229
And Mother is very kindly.

00:30:13.628 --> 00:30:17.149
But you don't have feelings for the Mother, do you?

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:33.685
Is it all a lip-service that you listen,

00:30:34.185 --> 00:30:37.696
goes into your head, and you think you have become

00:30:39.414 --> 00:30:41.774
the surrendered Sahaja yogis?

00:30:43.268 --> 00:30:47.175
Like all Islam people believe they are surrendered to God,

00:30:47.226 --> 00:30:50.226
like Christians believe they are surrendered to God.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.007
It's just a lip-service that you are this, you are that.

00:30:55.986 --> 00:31:00.762
Or do you know it him, what is said, is a fact.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.599
Have you not seen the Sun in my hand?

00:31:07.772 --> 00:31:09.421
What more proof you want?

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:36.070
Anybody who misleads you is of course sinful no doubt,

00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:40.728
but to fall a trap to such a person!

00:31:43.939 --> 00:31:48.151
If you had told a child that the Mother is coming, he would have fought,

00:31:48.651 --> 00:31:49.438
"I'm going".

00:31:52.898 --> 00:31:54.898
He would have cried and wept.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.880
What about your vibrations?

00:32:03.099 --> 00:32:05.099
You don't use your vibrations?

00:32:06.844 --> 00:32:09.674
You have come all the way for Guru Puja here,

00:32:10.285 --> 00:32:13.047
who is your Guru? Whom are you going to worship?

00:32:14.681 --> 00:32:19.121
Anybody comes from anywhere becomes suddenly important. How?

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.344
It was never done before,

00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:31.898
first time I see such a horrible thing.

00:32:34.418 --> 00:32:38.349
In my living time if you are doing like this, after my death so many gurus will rise,

00:32:39.306 --> 00:32:39.991
to mislead you.

00:32:48.293 --> 00:32:50.293
Are you going to accept all that?

00:33:09.911 --> 00:33:14.631
All the Deities refused for me to do this.

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:18.386
They tortured my life, they would not accept

00:33:19.444 --> 00:33:24.043
to allow you to have the Puja. Absolutely, nothing doing.

00:33:28.997 --> 00:33:31.588
Because they love me, they respect me.

00:33:32.088 --> 00:33:34.088
They have the proper protocol.

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:36.145
They don't want to become gurus themselves,

00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:38.645
and misbehave in this manner.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:01.045
Last time when I came I really was very strong, with the French.

00:34:04.339 --> 00:34:10.469
I've told so many times that France is the Hell of the Universe.

00:34:17.443 --> 00:34:21.369
And you should fall a trap to something like that?

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.111
It's very supra-conscious, extremely supra-conscious.

00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:28.666
And arrogant.

00:34:39.901 --> 00:34:43.801
I've never known of such a Guru Puja. Never.

00:34:45.352 --> 00:34:48.499
Indians had only one Guru Puja, and they are praying that

00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:51.586
they should have at least one more Guru Puja.

00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:56.484
With all these Guru Pujas if you have achieved this kind of surrendering,

00:34:57.039 --> 00:34:59.775
it's better you do not have any more Guru Pujas at all.

00:35:00.275 --> 00:35:03.058
Don't deserve it. You cannot become Gurus,

00:35:03.558 --> 00:35:04.828
I can see that clearly.

00:35:06.324 --> 00:35:08.324
Without surrender how will you?

00:35:42.468 --> 00:35:45.835
All the Blessings of the Divine

00:35:47.774 --> 00:35:49.000
have been showered upon you.

00:35:51.796 --> 00:35:53.796
And what have you given back?

00:35:59.691 --> 00:36:01.691
Such ego?

00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:05.442
That you act to somebody because he has greater egos?

00:36:25.115 --> 00:36:27.115
It is a very bad example.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.935
You have to wash the feet of the Indians and drink that water.

00:36:38.435 --> 00:36:41.563
May be then you might realize where you are.

00:36:42.257 --> 00:36:44.257
You may be very developed and all that.

00:36:45.476 --> 00:36:47.476
And the Indians who are of your type,

00:36:49.055 --> 00:36:51.055
all of them have to do that.

00:36:59.108 --> 00:37:01.108
Why didn't you see your vibrations?

00:37:03.932 --> 00:37:07.752
When the blind gets his eyes, he doesn't close his eyes to see things, does he?

00:37:12.402 --> 00:37:14.402
And what has happened to your leaders also?

00:37:22.943 --> 00:37:24.943
All of them put together could not

00:37:25.015 --> 00:37:27.443
say that we will not have this nonsense at this time?

00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:42.604
Just coming to the airport, so many people have risen higher in life.

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:44.834
What are you doing here?

00:37:51.433 --> 00:37:53.433
You should have protested.

00:37:56.335 --> 00:37:59.961
I would like to know how many wanted to go to the airport and asked for it.

00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:02.181
Raise your hands. Honestly.

00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:06.138
Honestly.

00:38:18.082 --> 00:38:20.082
These are the only people who love me.

00:38:24.322 --> 00:38:25.208
May God Bless you.

00:38:45.813 --> 00:38:48.897
Tomorrow somebody tells you to insult me, will you do that?

00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:04.471
You know that if a king arrives from a small little place somewhere,

00:39:06.196 --> 00:39:09.555
or a prime minister from a very small island,

00:39:14.374 --> 00:39:16.506
from lardy and muddy island

00:39:17.006 --> 00:39:18.208
the prime minister came,

00:39:19.022 --> 00:39:22.811
and the prime minister of England had to go receive him.

00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:33.728
And if your Guru has come,

00:39:33.831 --> 00:39:35.831
all the gurus have to come to receive me,

00:39:38.433 --> 00:39:40.583
or to listen to something nonsensical here?

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.750
I felt like going back from the airport only,

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.250
the kind of vibrations I felt.

00:39:55.847 --> 00:39:57.847
How do you get into this kind of a maya?

00:40:02.087 --> 00:40:05.250
How you join hands? Except for a few.

00:40:15.315 --> 00:40:17.315
“Your quality will be known:

00:40:19.321 --> 00:40:22.050
how much you are surrendered to Me".

00:40:23.344 --> 00:40:24.456
Christ has said that.

00:40:30.003 --> 00:40:31.734
And today I say to you that.

00:40:35.395 --> 00:40:37.962
On all other things Sahaja yogis will protest.

00:40:39.025 --> 00:40:41.855
"This was not good, that was not good, this was done”.

00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:44.421
Against each other, against everything they will protest.

00:40:50.663 --> 00:40:52.998
"Sahaja yogi took this much money from us, and

00:40:53.035 --> 00:40:55.035
this should not have happened," they always tell me.

00:40:55.072 --> 00:40:57.805
Complaints and complaints, and complaints, and complaints!

00:41:04.627 --> 00:41:08.718
And for this kind of a nonsense they have no protest, nothing!

00:41:19.759 --> 00:41:22.106
You are all ego-oriented people and you like

00:41:22.325 --> 00:41:24.325
egoistical supra-conscious nonsense.

00:41:24.345 --> 00:41:25.694
That's what it is.

00:41:34.634 --> 00:41:37.097
You have all come for Guru Puja or for what have you come for?

00:41:38.328 --> 00:41:39.352
It is beyond me.

00:41:45.026 --> 00:41:48.267
This I'm talking to you as your Mother, and not as your Guru.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.784
As a Guru I’ll do what I have to do.

00:41:55.485 --> 00:41:58.350
I'm talking to you as a Mother. Is this the way to respect Her?

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.069
I told you, this is the last Guru Puja you'll be having,

00:42:06.174 --> 00:42:08.908
the last Puja you will be having, perhaps may be.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.640
It's shocking!

00:42:31.062 --> 00:42:33.062
You have to respect your Guru.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.692
Surrender to your Guru.

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:38.251
It is said that the Guru is

00:42:38.288 --> 00:42:41.974
the Param Chaitanya, but it is: the Param Chaitanya itself is your Guru.

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:54.063
"Agata Parama Chaitanya, Dhanyoham Tava Dharshan -

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.763
When the Paramchaitanya itself will come on this earth,

00:42:59.527 --> 00:43:01.443
I will feel myself so gratified

00:43:01.513 --> 00:43:03.862
to see the darshan of that Maya.

00:43:06.712 --> 00:43:08.712
In what world are you living?

00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:10.181
Where are you?

00:43:13.312 --> 00:43:14.275
Taking for granted?

00:43:24.174 --> 00:43:26.914
I know Mother has a right to punish you, very well.

00:43:27.414 --> 00:43:29.843
Even Krishna could be punished by His Mother.

00:43:36.896 --> 00:43:38.135
But I'm not interested.

00:43:44.212 --> 00:43:46.345
The children who want to disrespect me,

00:43:46.481 --> 00:43:48.481
and insult me, I have nothing to do with them.

00:43:52.175 --> 00:43:54.175
They have no love for me, I have nothing to do.

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:02.961
Only those

00:44:03.742 --> 00:44:07.421
who protested and wanted to go to the airport should come forward to do my Puja.

00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:12.656
Honestly.

00:44:21.711 --> 00:44:23.283
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:44:27.308 --> 00:44:30.124
You have insulted your Mother, who has given you Realization,

00:44:31.584 --> 00:44:34.061
who has done so much for you. Selflessly I've been working

00:44:35.107 --> 00:44:35.957
day in and day out,

00:44:41.223 --> 00:44:44.205
neglecting my own children, my own family,

00:44:45.731 --> 00:44:46.673
my grandchildren.

00:44:47.173 --> 00:44:48.198
For you?

00:45:10.724 --> 00:45:13.899
Only those people who wanted to go to the airport

00:45:14.399 --> 00:45:16.982
and said, and did not go, please come forward.

00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:19.816
Please.

00:45:35.209 --> 00:45:35.649
Come.

00:45:45.267 --> 00:45:47.267
He is meeting Me after so many years.

00:45:49.091 --> 00:45:49.941
When did you come?

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:54.701
Just imagine,

00:45:55.151 --> 00:45:57.469
they come all the way from here and there, and there.

00:45:57.737 --> 00:46:00.303
And nicely you are telling them to listen to some nonsense?

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.667
They have not come here to listen to anybody’s nonsense.

00:46:16.943 --> 00:46:18.943
Come forward, this side.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.639
Yes, of course, those who could not come,

00:46:24.692 --> 00:46:26.692
because they arrived late, I told them

00:46:26.944 --> 00:46:28.223
there is no program in the evening.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.394
All the Spanish,

00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:34.570
how sweet they were.

00:46:36.179 --> 00:46:38.179
Those who were here and did not come,

00:46:39.275 --> 00:46:40.153
otherwise.

00:46:50.963 --> 00:46:53.411
/?/

00:46:54.507 --> 00:46:57.031
/?/

00:46:57.372 --> 00:46:58.121
When did you come?

00:47:01.087 --> 00:47:01.746
/?/

00:47:05.605 --> 00:47:07.605
/?/

00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:10.237
/?/

00:47:11.813 --> 00:47:13.813
/?/

00:47:26.526 --> 00:47:28.908
/?/

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:37.557
/?/

00:47:42.112 --> 00:47:43.952
Yes, you can come along Swiss people…

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:24.491
Those who were here and did not come,

00:48:33.348 --> 00:48:36.467
should understand that you are living

00:48:39.284 --> 00:48:40.713
in the Kingdom of God.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:49.452
And when the Goddess of that Kingdom arrives,

00:48:50.002 --> 00:48:51.440
you have to be there.

00:49:07.727 --> 00:49:09.727
I'm sorry I have to do that,

00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:11.813
this is the promise I had to give to all the Deities.

00:49:26.412 --> 00:49:28.412
Know that you have to have all and more,

00:49:30.004 --> 00:49:32.004
you have to work hard. You have to meditate.

00:49:33.762 --> 00:49:35.762
Shows, that there is no discipline.

00:49:44.818 --> 00:49:48.176
I will also forgive Austrians, because their leader wanted to go.

00:49:49.636 --> 00:49:51.636
Austrians should be forgiven,

00:49:52.285 --> 00:49:54.285
because their leader wanted to go.

00:49:56.523 --> 00:49:58.523
They could come up too.

00:50:07.479 --> 00:50:10.177
One man can save and one man can destroy.

00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:15.705
Your leader is alright till it comes to Mother's point,

00:50:16.205 --> 00:50:18.205
but when you reach that point,

00:50:20.294 --> 00:50:22.294
then, you have to protest against your leader.

00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:29.992
Come along, come, sit here.

00:50:30.095 --> 00:50:31.464
All the rest should go at the back,

00:50:33.189 --> 00:50:34.223
just go at the back.

00:50:37.189 --> 00:50:41.351
Please go back. All others, go back,

00:50:43.638 --> 00:50:44.629
and sit down there.

00:50:49.167 --> 00:50:53.232
I had to promise this. I had to promise this to the Deities.

00:51:05.464 --> 00:51:07.464
They would not accept, they would not accept!

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:19.346
You must know there are Deities and Ganas and everyone is sitting here.

00:51:19.383 --> 00:51:22.709
They came forward before me, to France.

00:51:31.996 --> 00:51:34.528
24 hours they are working, you know that very well.

00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:36.581
You know it, it's not a story. You know that.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:40.628
They are working for you, helping you in every way, solving all your problems,

00:51:40.979 --> 00:51:41.451
don't they?

00:51:51.036 --> 00:51:53.036
Gavin also should not do my Puja.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.226
Because he should have said that.

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:55.472
So Gavin should go back.

00:51:57.313 --> 00:51:59.167
And all the English, who came here early,

00:51:59.376 --> 00:52:01.654
just to attend everything, to attend what, the nonsense?

00:52:06.055 --> 00:52:08.420
Gavin said he did not know, there was going to be a lecture

00:52:08.428 --> 00:52:09.720
otherwise he would of object it.

00:52:09.952 --> 00:52:11.572
But what about coming to the airport_

00:52:19.081 --> 00:52:21.081
English know how much I have worked with them.

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:31.014
All the leaders who did not protest should also go back.

00:52:39.038 --> 00:52:40.145
All should go.

00:52:41.194 --> 00:52:42.802
Those who have not protested.

00:52:57.085 --> 00:52:58.171
Guido you protested?

00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:01.241
Yes, Italians could be there.

00:53:08.096 --> 00:53:09.310
Guido protested,

00:53:09.538 --> 00:53:12.799
he could not understand: what was happening? Where is our Mother?

00:53:15.808 --> 00:53:18.840
Come this side. All the rest go at the back.

00:53:23.595 --> 00:53:25.679
What courage is needed for that kind of a thing?

00:53:33.895 --> 00:53:34.648
Of course.

00:53:41.303 --> 00:53:43.317
Otherwise there is a protest for everything,

00:53:43.562 --> 00:53:45.562
every day I'm receiving letters from people:

00:53:47.282 --> 00:53:49.825
"This is not good, that is not working out in Australia,

00:53:49.832 --> 00:53:51.983
is not working out here, that is not happening”.

00:53:52.284 --> 00:53:54.274
Everybody has a right to criticize everyone.

00:54:30.086 --> 00:54:33.449
French have been stupid in the past, and they are stupid even now.

00:54:34.396 --> 00:54:35.057
That's what they are,

00:54:35.994 --> 00:54:37.100
think knowing no end of themselves.

00:54:38.203 --> 00:54:40.679
Spanish people were, once upon a time, very aggressive,

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.960
but in Sahaja Yoga they are not like that.

00:54:48.134 --> 00:54:50.134
You must learn how to respect.

00:54:55.965 --> 00:54:57.542
You've had no good training.

00:54:58.042 --> 00:55:00.814
“Very bad breeding” - that's what God is going to say about you.

00:55:04.765 --> 00:55:06.877
I've done my level best to tell you how to behave.

00:55:24.485 --> 00:55:26.851
No protocol, any sense of protocol you have.

00:55:28.976 --> 00:55:29.979
It's like beggars.

00:55:42.785 --> 00:55:44.785
Today you have to resolve,

00:55:47.859 --> 00:55:49.859
and ask the forgiveness of all the Deities,

00:55:51.327 --> 00:55:55.648
that you are going to use your vibrations all the time. Resolve.

00:55:57.773 --> 00:56:01.813
And that no more such a thing we are going to repeat again. This is the last,

00:56:02.842 --> 00:56:03.599
never like this.

00:56:04.428 --> 00:56:06.691
I am very suppressed that English,

00:56:06.698 --> 00:56:09.590
they come even in sleet, in snow, this, that.

00:56:09.761 --> 00:56:12.633
And here what happened, as soon as they came to hell they became hellish?

00:56:14.083 --> 00:56:16.083
What have happen to the English?

00:56:21.969 --> 00:56:23.969
They have no personality of their own?

00:56:25.437 --> 00:56:29.059
Always they followed the French, and now go with them to the ditch.

00:56:29.559 --> 00:56:32.054
Is that the principle now maintain?

00:56:36.516 --> 00:56:39.008
“French Sahaja yogis said, French Sahaja yogis said”.

00:56:43.488 --> 00:56:46.572
Tomorrow French Sahaja yogi said: “Go and kill your Mother”. We’ll kill it.

00:56:46.816 --> 00:56:47.223
Is it?

00:56:48.892 --> 00:56:50.892
Because French Sahaja yogi have said.

00:57:06.492 --> 00:57:10.433
No individuality, no understanding of anything, stupid.

00:57:12.433 --> 00:57:13.577
/?/

00:57:17.091 --> 00:57:17.946
/?/

00:57:35.638 --> 00:57:36.467
/?/

00:57:39.224 --> 00:57:43.243
/?/

00:57:45.121 --> 00:57:47.734
/?/

00:57:49.537 --> 00:57:51.537
/?/

00:57:53.006 --> 00:57:54.082
/?/

00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:06.549
/?/

00:58:09.169 --> 00:58:11.169
/?/

00:58:12.517 --> 00:58:15.456
/?/

00:58:18.455 --> 00:58:21.824
This Yashi has come to Me from her childhood.

00:58:22.173 --> 00:58:24.112
And as children they used to come all the way.

00:58:24.113 --> 00:58:27.595
Do you know where this Old Delhi is,

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:29.864
and where her father was working for the university.

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:35.140
Whether I came at 6 o’clock, or 8 o’clock, or 10 o’clock,

00:58:35.393 --> 00:58:37.393
or in the night of a 12 o’clock.

00:58:37.488 --> 00:58:41.295
Her father with all his three daughters used to be there.

00:58:43.592 --> 00:58:46.159
And so much bubbling and joy that Mother has come.

00:59:10.482 --> 00:59:12.482
/?/

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:14.593
/?/

00:59:16.996 --> 00:59:18.061
/?/

00:59:19.142 --> 00:59:21.142
/?/

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.558
/?/

00:59:30.239 --> 00:59:31.559
/?/

00:59:32.059 --> 00:59:34.237
/?/

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:36.737
/?/

00:59:38.629 --> 00:59:40.629
/?/

00:59:52.477 --> 00:59:56.666
/?/

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.033
/?/

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.749
Many people have not seen me for month together.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.736
Whether you have seen me or not.

01:00:31.174 --> 01:00:34.258
As I'm angry with you,

01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:37.269
also I'm pleased with some people,

01:00:39.584 --> 01:00:41.991
those who have love for me.

01:00:49.557 --> 01:00:53.803
And as a symbol of that I want to give this ring to Guido.

01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:23.077
What surprises me, the gurus who lynch you,

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.277
the one who wanted this,

01:01:33.195 --> 01:01:36.346
Rolls Royce. They starved themselves for one year,

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.442
bought a Rolls Royce,

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.475
and went to receive him, and such a crowd

01:01:46.482 --> 01:01:48.711
that people could not get to the airport.

01:01:49.528 --> 01:01:51.528
That sort of a guru you need,

01:01:52.786 --> 01:01:54.786
who'll take you to hell!

01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:02.079
You don't want to go to heaven.

01:02:02.579 --> 01:02:05.850
You don't want to be the citizen of God's realm.

01:02:36.323 --> 01:02:37.752
Now whatever mantra you say,

01:02:39.838 --> 01:02:41.025
please listen.

01:02:42.653 --> 01:02:44.653
Put it in your heads what you are talking.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.709
What you are saying from your lips, listen.

01:02:52.843 --> 01:02:55.159
Put it in your heart what you are saying.

01:02:59.095 --> 01:03:00.453
Don't be hypocrites.

01:03:07.385 --> 01:03:08.966
No explanation is needed.

01:03:09.078 --> 01:03:12.242
"I've been to a guru, I've done this, I've done"- nothing of the kind.

01:03:16.002 --> 01:03:18.002
Even if at this stage, after so many days,

01:03:19.207 --> 01:03:22.284
if you have not realized that whatever we believe into

01:03:23.876 --> 01:03:24.958
should be

01:03:26.004 --> 01:03:27.484
part and parcel of ourselves.

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.737
I mean these wretched people like

01:03:29.779 --> 01:03:31.672
Christians and other people, these

01:03:31.714 --> 01:03:33.486
Hindus and Muslims and all that,

01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:36.378
they've not seen God, they've not got realization, nothing

01:03:36.578 --> 01:03:38.806
but to them it becomes a faith, they fight for it.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:42.876
And for you people who have seen the reality - it is not,

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:45.332
what's wrong with me?

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.588
People are afraid of the police, afraid of this.

01:03:59.647 --> 01:04:01.647
You have entered into the Kingdom of God.

01:04:01.759 --> 01:04:03.042
You have seen what has happened

01:04:04.511 --> 01:04:07.350
with people who have tried to trouble me.

01:04:15.462 --> 01:04:16.530
Aren't you afraid of that?

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:29.478
Don't become frivolous:

01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:34.315
"What was there to go to the airport, after all doesn't matter".

01:04:38.586 --> 01:04:40.712
All the Ganas went there, with me.

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:46.278
They have all noted down, and they are here too.

01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:53.964
I am so cautiously taking you out, because you don't see them.

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.777
But you'll see them very soon.

01:05:05.722 --> 01:05:08.340
It's not easy to control them also, you must know that.

01:05:09.897 --> 01:05:12.146
I do not control you, neither I control them.

01:05:21.897 --> 01:05:26.266
So now, I don't want to be unkind to people

01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:29.875
who have been desiring to come and see me, who love me so much.

01:05:31.397 --> 01:05:34.989
And I want to forgive you all, all of you,

01:05:35.894 --> 01:05:37.894
because this was the first mistake.

01:06:02.817 --> 01:06:05.346
Nobody should fix my program without asking me.

01:06:06.427 --> 01:06:07.938
Nobody should take such liberties.

01:06:08.614 --> 01:06:11.458
From next time I will not do anything of the kind,

01:06:11.464 --> 01:06:12.802
I'm telling you very clearly!

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.600
You fix my program, and I'll let you down!

01:06:16.927 --> 01:06:19.275
Without asking me you are not to fix me anywhere.

01:06:23.893 --> 01:06:26.428
Without taking my permission, written permission.

01:06:28.516 --> 01:06:31.842
If you ever try to do such tricks with me, I'll put you right.

01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:41.398
You know I have all the powers to correct you.

01:06:45.437 --> 01:06:47.437
Don't take liberties with me anymore.

01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:49.156
I'm telling you, I am warning you.

01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:54.699
Try to understand, you are facing

01:06:56.042 --> 01:06:58.324
Someone, Who has all the Powers.

01:07:05.026 --> 01:07:05.787
You know that,

01:07:08.288 --> 01:07:11.009
know well, within yourself.

01:07:15.561 --> 01:07:19.356
It's not even like Mohammad. Mohammad just talked.

01:07:21.014 --> 01:07:22.334
He never gave realization,

01:07:24.881 --> 01:07:25.627
He warned.

01:07:27.368 --> 01:07:28.730
None of them, none of them.

01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:34.751
But after seeing, none of them have photographs as you have seen of mine.

01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:35.396
Have they?

01:07:44.466 --> 01:07:47.132
What more proof you want to know what I am.

01:07:49.003 --> 01:07:51.003
Now behave yourself. I'm warning you!

01:07:53.092 --> 01:07:53.868
Mahamaya -

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:59.032
the other side of it is horrible.

01:08:00.591 --> 01:08:01.248
Be careful.

01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:09.917
Only for those

01:08:11.632 --> 01:08:13.632
who are my children I come on this earth.

01:08:14.584 --> 01:08:16.015
Not for those who are not,

01:08:18.244 --> 01:08:19.354
I've nothing to do with them.

01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:28.470
I did try

01:08:29.157 --> 01:08:31.235
to save you, as a prodigal son has to be saved,

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:33.330
that's different. That's very different.

01:08:36.214 --> 01:08:39.532
But don't take liberties with me, I must tell you and warn you.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.168
I do not need any. The heat is just

01:09:12.369 --> 01:09:13.410
drying up everything.

01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:32.409
I feel like a Mother who is insulted, abused,

01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:35.158
ill-treated by her own children.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:42.430
You can take interest from others,

01:09:42.452 --> 01:09:44.559
not from your own children. You cannot.

01:09:44.953 --> 01:09:46.157
Very difficult.

01:09:54.453 --> 01:09:56.366
If you do not understand any protocol,

01:09:56.713 --> 01:09:57.944
because you are so naive,

01:09:58.329 --> 01:10:01.020
you have never known anything, you don't know how to respect.

01:10:05.595 --> 01:10:06.511
Then you better learn it.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.104
There is no Shraddha,

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:20.359
because it was never there. You don't know how to respect anyone.

01:10:21.732 --> 01:10:24.456
You only have respect for yourself, perhaps may not be that even.

01:10:37.152 --> 01:10:41.829
Today is a day of a very great event.

01:10:45.448 --> 01:10:46.125
And

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:54.235
“Guru" is a word as I told you, comes from the word "Gravity".

01:10:57.245 --> 01:11:00.187
The gravity. And the gravity,

01:11:01.326 --> 01:11:04.430
that's what I felt, that I have no gravity to attract you people.

01:11:06.504 --> 01:11:09.827
Or you people have no weight at all in you, that I should gravitate you.

01:11:18.452 --> 01:11:20.452
Anything that has weight

01:11:23.165 --> 01:11:26.736
gravitates, automatically.

01:11:29.479 --> 01:11:33.165
It does not gravitate towards itself, but it gravitates.

01:11:35.967 --> 01:11:39.609
There's also gravity between the matter.

01:11:42.753 --> 01:11:47.565
But what it has towards Mother Earth is incomparable.

01:11:49.521 --> 01:11:51.521
You throw any stone out, it comes back.

01:11:58.066 --> 01:12:00.066
Impossible to fight the gravity.

01:12:05.156 --> 01:12:09.560
And that gravity is the integration

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:12.327
of your Shraddha,

01:12:13.659 --> 01:12:15.779
of your Dedication, and your surrender.

01:12:28.473 --> 01:12:33.544
Without that gravity you cannot nourish yourself, you cannot grow.

01:12:35.203 --> 01:12:37.203
Just imagine, the roots

01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:41.307
go towards the gravity.

01:12:43.099 --> 01:12:46.189
And when they are nourished, then only, the tree rises above.

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:52.002
If your roots are not deep, if your roots are so flimsy,

01:12:52.784 --> 01:12:54.083
you cannot go down.

01:12:58.222 --> 01:13:00.852
Unless you go down in that gravity,

01:13:02.437 --> 01:13:03.286
you cannot come up.

01:13:05.078 --> 01:13:06.232
You cannot nourish yourself.

01:13:06.536 --> 01:13:08.757
Now my talk should not be a waste again.

01:13:09.257 --> 01:13:10.171
Please listen to me.

01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:14.227
I'm addressing to you, all of you. Remember that.

01:13:16.097 --> 01:13:19.320
Do not think that I'm addressing to somebody else. It is to you all.

01:13:22.085 --> 01:13:25.141
So the only way one can ascend in Sahaja Yoga is through

01:13:25.641 --> 01:13:26.511
putting the roots down.

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:28.956
Allow the roots to grow.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:33.070
Unless and until roots grow, the tree cannot grow.

01:13:33.103 --> 01:13:36.103
I have seen many Sahaja yogis who talk big about Sahaja Yoga,

01:13:36.113 --> 01:13:38.576
they can write books, they can write things.

01:13:38.762 --> 01:13:41.964
The other day I saw somebody writing a big pamphlet about Sahaja Yoga,

01:13:43.008 --> 01:13:44.307
nothing inside the person!

01:13:49.765 --> 01:13:51.305
That's not the sign of a Sahaja yogi.

01:13:51.641 --> 01:13:54.196
A Sahaja yogi has to gravitate inside.

01:13:57.174 --> 01:13:58.001
How do we do it?

01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:05.094
In the year 1982 I told you the eightfold ways of doing it,

01:14:05.102 --> 01:14:06.604
and I said: I will tell you later.

01:14:07.888 --> 01:14:09.888
And I was about to tell you. But not now,

01:14:13.214 --> 01:14:16.069
there are other eight ways by which you can rise.

01:14:17.772 --> 01:14:21.992
Because, you are not yet grounded in Sahaja Yoga, you are not yet grounded.

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:31.118
I thought you would be grounded, you're not.

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:35.569
You have to nourish

01:14:37.691 --> 01:14:42.102
the other way around. The roots are in the head,

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:52.345
by becoming thoughtless, by not making the cells to think.

01:14:55.744 --> 01:14:59.872
By resting them, by peace within. It is not a show of a peace,

01:15:00.518 --> 01:15:04.820
or just some people look very peaceful for a show.

01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:07.630
You have to work it out here in your head.

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.625
The grounding - it has to go into your awareness.

01:15:15.115 --> 01:15:17.115
How? - Meditation.

01:15:19.584 --> 01:15:21.584
There's no discipline I'm told.

01:15:22.868 --> 01:15:25.362
Hounslow, I'm told, there's no discipline of any kind.

01:15:26.008 --> 01:15:28.210
I'm surprised Hounslow people have no discipline

01:15:28.382 --> 01:15:30.511
of getting up early in the morning and doing meditation.

01:15:36.626 --> 01:15:37.340
What are you doing?

01:15:40.757 --> 01:15:41.842
How are you going to grow?

01:15:45.514 --> 01:15:47.917
How does the tree grow? It does not grow in the day time.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:52.138
It grows in the morning, early in the morning, you never see that.

01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:01.153
How these roots are going to grow into the head?

01:16:02.018 --> 01:16:06.762
Into your brain, into that Jada (gross).

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:14.365
You have to meditate. That's the only way you can do it.

01:16:14.628 --> 01:16:17.925
Those who do not meditate will become superficial.

01:16:19.245 --> 01:16:21.596
They'll not achieve anything, they create problems /?/.

01:16:22.479 --> 01:16:25.352
If they are right sided, they'll become supra-conscious, they'll become bhoots.

01:16:26.618 --> 01:16:29.329
If they are left-sided, they'll become left sided they will be thrown out!

01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:31.210
You've seen it, in the Sistine Chapel,

01:16:31.384 --> 01:16:33.628
you see Christ throwing them out one by one.

01:16:34.681 --> 01:16:38.129
And then you should not blame me. Just listening to me is not sufficient.

01:16:39.434 --> 01:16:43.716
It must grow. Actualization of the growth of the thing is needed.

01:16:43.855 --> 01:16:44.609
Do you follow that?

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:52.824
You've read all kinds of nonsensical things before.

01:16:53.264 --> 01:16:55.553
All kinds of horrid things, I know what you have read.

01:16:57.664 --> 01:17:01.257
You have read in this horrible French country all kinds of

01:17:02.598 --> 01:17:03.905
sadists, like Sade,

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:08.999
or Sade whatever you call him.

01:17:11.903 --> 01:17:13.148
And there were many like this,

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.829
who wrote horrible books for you,

01:17:16.329 --> 01:17:18.329
which you have read. But they have not read "Advent".

01:17:18.829 --> 01:17:20.829
How many Sahaja yogis who have not yet read "Advent"?

01:17:22.403 --> 01:17:25.694
But only reading is not going to help, it must go into your brain.

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:29.550
And brain means what? Into your Central Nervous System.

01:17:30.259 --> 01:17:32.259
Brain doesn't mean in the thinking.

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:35.277
Into your central nervous system, into

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.935
the cells of your central nervous system.

01:17:41.416 --> 01:17:43.416
That light has to come into the cells.

01:17:46.679 --> 01:17:48.679
You have to grow and grow, and grow!

01:17:54.077 --> 01:17:56.569
There's only way left out for you to go to Himalayas,

01:17:58.213 --> 01:18:00.213
and not to any Ashram or any place.

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:03.410
But settle down somewhere where you don't eat anything

01:18:03.477 --> 01:18:06.570
or do anything, and take another birth. That's the only way I think.

01:18:13.726 --> 01:18:16.004
We can work it out, not difficult.

01:18:19.532 --> 01:18:21.532
If you have the seeking within your heart,

01:18:23.539 --> 01:18:24.928
and if you have understanding,

01:18:25.009 --> 01:18:26.953
sense, intelligence to understand that

01:18:26.965 --> 01:18:29.774
you have achieved something in life, you can do it.

01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:34.243
You all can do it.

01:18:38.971 --> 01:18:41.342
We don't forgive others, we forgive ourselves.

01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:42.859
This is the worst thing that we do.

01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:46.810
We all the time try to forgive others,

01:18:48.566 --> 01:18:49.612
that's the best way

01:18:52.359 --> 01:18:54.684
to work it out. But no, we try

01:18:56.119 --> 01:18:58.996
to forgive ourselves all the time and not to forgive others.

01:19:00.543 --> 01:19:02.543
Everything you do the other way around.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:08.608
We are Sahaja yogis. We're yogis, Saints.

01:19:11.675 --> 01:19:15.013
So, you have to be the guru.

01:19:18.094 --> 01:19:19.258
I'm a Guru myself,

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:22.456
and what's the conveyance of a Guru?

01:19:23.975 --> 01:19:25.975
What is the animal he keeps? His dog.

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:32.273
And do you know what a dog is? Do you know the qualities of a dog?

01:19:33.868 --> 01:19:35.696
He loves his master.

01:19:37.243 --> 01:19:38.878
He'll give his life for his Master.

01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:44.441
He'll not sleep till he sees his master return back.

01:19:50.062 --> 01:19:50.840
Any time!

01:19:53.084 --> 01:19:53.754
We had a dog,

01:19:55.063 --> 01:19:58.274
and every time I went out, every time

01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:01.467
he would come and sit at the door waiting for me.

01:20:08.651 --> 01:20:12.915
And some people tried very hard thing on him, some vegetarians

01:20:14.254 --> 01:20:17.767
and he was about to die. We put him in the hospital.

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.416
When I went there, I sat before him.

01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:24.385
He just pulled all his body,

01:20:25.234 --> 01:20:29.100
put his head on my feet, and died peacefully.

01:20:29.687 --> 01:20:32.949
It's a dog, animal.

01:20:41.822 --> 01:20:44.142
When I went away, say, out of

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.340
my house, he would not eat food till I came back.

01:20:48.063 --> 01:20:50.244
To any other country I went, he would not eat food

01:20:50.284 --> 01:20:52.284
for all these days. He would not eat his food,

01:20:52.672 --> 01:20:53.333
till I came back.

01:20:56.650 --> 01:20:59.579
He would not disturb me, but would sleep outside

01:21:00.404 --> 01:21:01.622
waiting for me to get up.

01:21:09.035 --> 01:21:12.171
That's a disciple. Unless and until you become good disciples

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:13.653
how are you going to become the gurus?

01:21:15.374 --> 01:21:17.082
What's the use of my telling you anything about it?

01:21:18.094 --> 01:21:19.983
You don't have any discipline of your own,

01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:21.831
how are you going to give discipline to others?

01:21:23.331 --> 01:21:26.374
You yourself are tempted into all kinds of things,

01:21:27.059 --> 01:21:29.598
how are you going to make others

01:21:29.678 --> 01:21:31.864
understand you? What have you got, to become the guru?

01:21:33.057 --> 01:21:37.267
What can you give? All the Saints have spent their own money,

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:40.020
all over the world any where it is.

01:21:42.305 --> 01:21:44.646
To spread Sahaja Yoga how much money have you spent?

01:21:47.305 --> 01:21:51.415
Of your own. How much money have you spent of your own to spread Sahaja Yoga?

01:21:57.359 --> 01:21:59.297
They used to starve themselves

01:21:59.579 --> 01:22:02.665
to get some. I have spent thousands, you know that very well.

01:22:02.859 --> 01:22:06.178
You know for definite how many thousands I have spent on you people.

01:22:08.193 --> 01:22:10.979
Even the Puja money that I get, you know, each and every money,

01:22:11.088 --> 01:22:14.039
I use it for buying some silver things for you.

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:19.181
It should not be for you, it is for me I should say, but I do it.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.810
Every Saint used to spend money,

01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:32.693
Christ had to spend money to spread His Christianity,

01:22:32.926 --> 01:22:36.056
He never spread Christianity, His own message.

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:39.273
Tukarama had to do it,

01:22:40.245 --> 01:22:42.245
Gyaneshwara had to do it. Whatever they had,

01:22:42.745 --> 01:22:45.523
they used that money, whatever they had, to spread

01:22:47.289 --> 01:22:51.008
Sahaja Yoga. Why? In Sahaja Yoga,

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.847
the greatest thing I notice, everybody is so blessed.

01:22:56.684 --> 01:22:59.143
They have nice houses, nice ashrams,

01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:01.536
all conveniences, everything so well done.

01:23:03.609 --> 01:23:04.527
They are so blessed.

01:23:06.642 --> 01:23:09.979
God looks after them, all their problems get solved. They want

01:23:10.161 --> 01:23:13.129
marriages, so good marriages are done, everything is done well.

01:23:15.244 --> 01:23:17.244
Everything gets sorted out.

01:23:18.217 --> 01:23:20.062
Only blessings are there, no duties.

01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:29.485
How much money have you spent for Sahaja Yoga?

01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:31.538
First of all you should ask a question.

01:23:32.195 --> 01:23:33.864
How much time I have given for Sahaja Yoga?

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:36.759
How many people I have given realization to?

01:23:39.315 --> 01:23:41.315
How much righteous and virtuous I have been?

01:23:44.091 --> 01:23:46.537
What have I done to bring the good name to Sahaja Yoga?

01:23:47.419 --> 01:23:49.673
What about my personal behavior, how I have lived?

01:23:58.423 --> 01:24:00.423
Arneau has spent lot of money I know,

01:24:02.253 --> 01:24:06.237
he and his wife. I know about everyone.

01:24:14.881 --> 01:24:16.881
You have to give time, money,

01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:20.042
everything, your job,

01:24:20.391 --> 01:24:22.969
everything you have to give up. People have given up jobs!

01:24:23.469 --> 01:24:25.469
I've told you the stories

01:24:26.306 --> 01:24:29.319
how people have sacrificed for ordinary things like

01:24:29.819 --> 01:24:31.819
freedom, fighting and all that.

01:24:36.499 --> 01:24:38.898
So today, as I told you, you have to resolve

01:24:39.398 --> 01:24:41.398
that we are going to have

01:24:42.693 --> 01:24:45.515
the growth within ourselves through our Shraddha

01:24:45.617 --> 01:24:46.827
and through our surrender.

01:24:47.884 --> 01:24:49.884
Only through Meditation you can do it.

01:24:53.108 --> 01:24:56.500
“We are all going to grow Mother into this”,

01:24:56.905 --> 01:25:00.414
this you have to promise me as I stand before you as a Guru.

01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.566
Alright?

01:25:11.233 --> 01:25:14.160
We'll have the Guru Puja now, not Mother's Puja I don't feel like having.

01:25:14.515 --> 01:25:16.515
Let’s start the Guru Puja. Come along.

01:25:17.537 --> 01:25:21.684
Bring the water, I have to wash My hands for the Guru Puja

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:37.730
When I say something, you will smile and talk to me, giggle, laugh,

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.022
in the program also.

01:25:40.047 --> 01:25:41.277
In the church you keep quiet.

01:25:41.998 --> 01:25:44.485
If there is a bhoot-of-a-pope sitting, you all keep quiet.

01:25:51.366 --> 01:25:55.358
No breeding at all, ill-mannered, badly brought up.

01:26:06.362 --> 01:26:08.362
It's better you give me only porcelain one.

01:26:08.654 --> 01:26:10.654
/?/

01:26:13.879 --> 01:26:15.879
It's like a dog becomes mad, you know.

01:26:18.251 --> 01:26:20.700
But such dogs are killed.

01:26:21.888 --> 01:26:23.556
They are not kept in the public.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.121
/?/

01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:32.621
Such sweet dogs. See one by one.

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:36.848
See now Italians have brought such beautiful dogs for you to see.

01:26:42.254 --> 01:26:44.254
/?/

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:08.570
(Sahaja Yogi: Those are the dogs chosen by Shri Mataji herself).

01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:10.650
I chose you also.

01:27:11.617 --> 01:27:14.898
I've chosen you also. But look at them how sweet they are.

01:27:17.546 --> 01:27:20.342
So pleasure giving, so joy giving.

01:27:23.831 --> 01:27:25.646
They are so timely they'll absorb

01:27:26.387 --> 01:27:29.442
all the anger of the Deities I'm sure,

01:27:29.533 --> 01:27:30.985
sitting down here like Deities.

01:27:31.967 --> 01:27:32.705
Beautifully.

01:28:20.359 --> 01:28:24.023
/?/ that is the one to keep it here, has to bark at people,

01:28:26.703 --> 01:28:29.312
for those who do not behave. Turn it out like that.

01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:32.706
German dog.

01:28:52.447 --> 01:28:54.447
So sweet they are. Beautiful.

01:29:05.625 --> 01:29:08.976
Do not forgive yourself, forgive others.

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.300
Then you will become gurus.

01:29:16.967 --> 01:29:18.180
Life should be such,

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:22.527
that those who come in close contact with you should feel respect for you,

01:29:24.761 --> 01:29:28.279
that you are so disciplined. You are very disciplined.

01:29:34.506 --> 01:29:37.508
I've seen this. My husband is coming,

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:41.497
tomorrow, you'll be having program.

01:29:42.867 --> 01:29:45.328
And I've seen one thing about his life,

01:29:45.702 --> 01:29:49.446
one thing, which I have to tell you,

01:29:50.425 --> 01:29:53.870
which has made him such a great man. He's an extremely disciplined man.

01:29:54.233 --> 01:29:55.877
Extremely disciplined.

01:30:02.037 --> 01:30:03.575
The one, who does not have discipline,

01:30:03.588 --> 01:30:05.588
is like a dog which is amuck,

01:30:08.251 --> 01:30:10.737
which has got rabies.

01:30:14.021 --> 01:30:16.684
After realization you have to be disciplined people.

01:30:18.675 --> 01:30:24.446
Discipline yourself. This is what I said in 1982, again I'm repeating it.

01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:30.411
But now, the second half of it which I said, I'll tell in India,

01:30:31.901 --> 01:30:34.246
which I hope they will send it over to you.
